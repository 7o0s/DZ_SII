There was another culprit back in 2006 whose brick wall ending left players slack-jawed, moist controller falling loosely from their grip with the horrible dawning realisation that that was it. The game really did just end. Clearly the victim of a boot-it-out-the-door-it's-Christmas production compromise worse than Bungie's flawed opus, it was an exercise in how not to end a game.   Sad truth: you'll have to stay baited of breath though. Rainbow Six Vegas 2 totally and utterly ignores that little detail with the most vexing of intentional amnesia. 'Want resolution?', asks Ubisoft. 'Nerp! Here's a prequel!' So welcome to Vegas, five years prior, with you  Bishop  and your trusty squad of through-the-door-first cannon fodder. Honestly, if this was Star Trek they'd be loitering on their transporter rings, glancing round nervously, wondering why all the other blokes are in smart yellow jerkins, and they're conspicuously dressed in burgundy.   There's a lot going on onscreen - and as such the framerate suffers.  But have we really returned to Vegas? The first game strained at its chubby seams with lashings of shiny Sin City detail. Bullets thudded into slot machines, pissing out coins like a particularly violent bingo win, and no opportunity to helicopter round the Strip to show off the beautifully detailed and painstakingly realised city was left untapped. This time though, the focus is on slightly less than expected high schools, back yards, junkyards, train stations and even a sodding convention centre. And anyone's whose been to any expo of any sort can confirm: convention centres are not sexy places. Honestly, this may as well be Rainbow Six: Reading. Only with a few more terrorists.   Of course, all that might give the impression we don't like the game, when we very much do. And here's the meat of the thing, and why this title's getting a better score than perhaps the lazy plotting and Vegas-free Vegas should warrant: sliding this disc in is like sliding on a comfy pair of Converse pumps. Vegas is the Ronseal of gaming: you know that what is says on the tin is exactly what you're going to get. And in spades.    Someone's in for a little surprise.  Like it's predecessor, gameplay is tense, solid, challenging and Tupperware-like in its watertightness. For instance, if you want to hug a wall for cover, you'll hug it. If you don't, you won't. It's astonishing how many games get things as basic as this wrong. Missions are challenging, well structured and flawlessly paced, with enough shushed sprinting to make the exciting stuff feel genuinely exciting. Some bright spark was clearly listening when Bungie evangelised about Halo's '30 seconds of fun', made some notes and pinned it on an ideas board somewhere. In capitals.   Enemy AI is cunning enough to challenge, but dumb enough so you can plan your next assault better when you've inevitably died a couple of times over. Your boys generally have enough wits to go where you want them and point the business end of their guns at the right people. Although quite why they still need to be told their buddy's lying next to them writhing in agony and groaning like they've got man flu is quite beyond us.     Another deft touch is that real-life friends can now drop in and out of your single-player game experience to help out at a moment's notice. Admittedly, it's not much less half-arsed than the original game's similar mode, but it's there and fun in its own way. There's even the childish delight of mapping your face in-game using the 360's camera, your fat mug - smeared coolly with camo paint - appearing in the load menu, and then gurning every time you take cover, which is impossibly brilliant. Sure, there's not much new of real substance which perhaps leaves Vegas some way off being a proper Rainbow Six 2.0, but at least what's here is done very right - and you can't say fairer than that.   This chap has alarmingly big hands. All the better to handle his large gun.   As an aside, special mention must be made of the almost awesomely retarded final 'boss'. After a typically tense chase through the closing territory, the developers cheerfully jettison your trusty squad, along with the entire game dynamic you've just spend the last eight or so hours honing to perfection, in favour of a totally arbitrary, learn-by-rote face-off final face-off. It's a tedious, war of attrition battle, reaching Turok T-Rex levels of ineptitude. And left a nasty sensation in our mouths that really didn't taste like victory.   Moving on from the single-player experience though, and Vegas is a title that keeps on giving. The four-player Terrorist Hunt  a genuinely ground-breaking experience when it launched a year before Halo 3, never truly getting the props it deserved  returns, also pretty much untouched, albeit with new scenarios and new missions. Yet it still delivers that strangely retro LAN party-like experience. This could easily chew up your Friday nights for months to come, resulting in much eye-rolling and tutting from Mrs. [Insert subject name here].   Sunnier than your average shooter.  And that's not counting the more conventional multiplayer modes  still some of the most anally retentive online match-ups in gaming. It's the Marmite of online tussles: a game that's never going to send chills down the servers of Microsoft's biggies - the Halos, Gears Of Wars and COD4s of the world - but those that like it bloody love it. Noobs will continue to find it a veritable PhD in headshot collection, but persevere, soldier  put the time in, and this really does reward. And if you get bored, simply cycling through the weapon options can take up almost an entire weekend.Its a girly grumble, but a proper one: if a publisher insists on giving different games to different teams, plan the narrative across both first. If youre going to end a game on a cliffhanger, make its sequel address this! Sheesh! That aside, if you liked Rainbow Six Vegas, we can give a cast iron IGN-stamped guarantee that youll like this. Its essentially more of the same game. Should this sequel have innovated and added new stuff? Taken a few risks? Honestly, we dont know. What we do know is that we we dont feel short changed, just stinking slightly of dj vu.", "date": "Mar 20, 2008"}
