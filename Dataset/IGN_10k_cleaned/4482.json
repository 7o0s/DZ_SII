Switchix For Prizes!, one of the straight puzzle games in Atlas Mobile's service, is very reminiscent of Bejewelled which seems to come pre-loaded on every single PDA.  Features:  Four themes: planets, sports, flowers, medieval Four levels of difficulty Head-to-head play Progressive tournaments Practice Mode  Switchix For Prizes! presents the player with a board full of symbols -- based on one of four themes, such as flowers and sports. The goal is simple, flip the pieces around to create combos of three. The pieces disappear and points are awarded. Of course, if you can manage to create bigger combos of four or more, as well as cause chain reactions, the points flow like wine at a wedding.  A time meter sits on the right side of the screen, constantly dropping. One the left is a score meter, which you must fill as quickly as possible. Fill the score meter before time runs out, and it's on to the next puzzle -- with a great degree of difficulty. The game ends (successfully) when you beat the fourth puzzle.  Three-item combos are worth 10 points. Four-item and five-item combos are worth 20 and 40 points, respectively. The big money starts rolling in when you mange to cause chain reactions, as each one is worth the combo total, as well as an extra five points per chain reaction. Naturally, the game awards you extra points for finishing each puzzle in record time.  Fortunately, there is a Practice Mode so you can acquaint (or re-acquaint yourself) with the basics of the game. Switchix For Prizes! is extremely addictive, so once you fire it up, you better hope you have some spare time on your hands. Sure, it's cool that you may win a prize, but there is a certain amount of reward in just finishing the four puzzles.  Switchix For Prizes! is probably one of the better-looking games on Atlas Mobile's service. The different themes are a cool addition, and keep the game looking fresh. Also nifty -- Atlas Mobile can update these icons whenever it like. So, it's possible they could switch out planets for pets.Switchix For Prizes! and Tetris Tournament For Prizes! are easily my favorite games on the Atlas Mobile service. I prefer puzzlers over card games -- even the highly-entertaining Prize-21 -- and Switchix For Prizes! is a great variation on the Bejeweled theme. Besides, how cool is it that I can win stuff just for playing one of my fave puzzlers?", "date": "Feb 21, 2004"}
