Though his exploits haven't brought in the same amount of financial gain that the old-school versions did, his cult popularity and status as an industry icon have continued to fuel a steady stream of updates and sequels without even a hint of slowdown. In 2003 alone, Mega Man has already seen five different videogame incarnations, with several more planned for 2004: including an eight-game anniversary collection, another installment of the Battle Network series, and an RPG spin-off of the X franchise. With numbers like those, it seems that there's no stopping this cerulean cyborg as he continues his quest to become the most overused personality in the entire digital medium.   Then again, maybe he can be stopped. Evidence of this can be found in the sixth bomber title of 2003, Mega Man X7. Developed by the same team that pieced together the 2D PSOne Mega Man X games and the PS2 version of Code Veronica, X7 tries to stray away from the elements that made it such a lasting series in the first place -- mixing two-dimensional fundamentals with enhanced three-dimensional perspectives. Mega Man X7 also implements an all-new character swapping system that makes the whole experience a little more strategic than usual. But change, particularly in this case, isn't always a good thing.   Gameplay  One of the true innovators of the action/platform genre in the eight and 16-bit eras, Mega Man and Mega Man X have always been about combining difficult challenges, imaginative bosses, and impromptu strategies in one complete package. The real differences between the original series and the X franchise, however, is that the X titles have always been about storylines, upgrades, and technology. Where in comparison, the original line focused more on the RoShamBo-like approach to defeating stage bosses and its old-fashioned platforming elements. Staying true to form, Mega Man X7 is definitely more amalgamated with the ideals of the X lineage. Because to survive the battle here, you'll need to learn a wide range of skills and earn several different abilities to defeat the challenges that lay before you -- and oh what a challenge it is.    Definitely our favorite aspect of the whole experience, X7 is a brutally hard undertaking that weighs in as one of the most demanding titles on the PlayStation 2 this year. With aggressive pattern-based enemies and a multitude of different stage puzzles that require you to figure out how to advance in a hurry, fans of the series should definitely get what they're looking for. Another big bonus this year is the incorporation of the two-character switch-out system; which allows users to choose between X, Zero, and newcomer Axl by simply tapping L2 at any time. So while Zero will prove overly useful in sections that require close-quarter battles and multi-spot jumping techniques, Axl proves invaluable for long range assaults and enemy-specific brainteasers -- as his Copy Shot allows him to steal the form and abilities of certain other robots for a short amount of time.   This new approach to advancement works pretty well in theory, and in certain stages like the Deep Forest or Tunnel Base can definitely be appreciated in practice. In other sections of the game, however, it's far too easy to advance without needing to switch characters at all -- with gun-toting heroes X and Axl proving far more valuable than our red sword-using buddy Zero.   But if an imbalanced need for characters turned out to be Mega Man X7's only real problem, then the game would ultimately be a lot better than it is. Alas, once you look past the welcome difficulty of enemies and the slight innovation via character swapping, you'll find that there are a quite a number of issues that should have been fixed but weren't; the camera problems in particular. Here, let us explain:    Because of Mega Man X7's mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay, the perspective changes from a traditional side-scrolling viewpoint to isometric and free-roaming vantages more often than not. Not surprisingly, it's when X7 is in its two-dimensional mode where it stands out the most -- with true skill-based challenges and a difficulty created out of obstacles, not technicalities. The 3D aspect, on the other hand, is where Mega Man really begins to fall apart. Due to the semi-automatic nature of the camera that follows your crew in the 3D landscape, the CPU pretty much determines what you can and can't see.   Though you will be able to manipulate the camera a small bit in certain sections with the L1 and R1 buttons, there are very few environments that actually let you take advantage of this; and less than useful zooms and an abundance of obstacles that take a moment to become transparent mar even that privilege. The result of all this is that your character will consistently be assaulted by wave after wave of cheap hits until enemies that you can't even see claim your life. Combine that with the fact that the targeting system isn't very responsive and that several of the 3D platforming sections are difficult to judge in terms of distance, and you have yourself quite a dilemma.   It's all pretty sad really. As despite the positive changes that Mega Man X7 has made in comparison to its previous incarnations (re: MMX6's reploid hunt is better utilized, Zero can finally deflect projectiles with his sword, and X's X-Buster is more powerful), the technical issues far outweigh anything else.   It's hard to determine how many times we performed the classic Mega Man wall jump only to fall to our deaths because of an unexplained camera shift. It's unbelievable to fathom how many life-sucking shots we endured from unknown locations because the camera refused to turn in the proper direction. And it's especially tricky to ascertain how many reploids we lost simply because the camera refused to let us see in certain directions. It is truly frustrating stuff.    If players can hang around long enough to get to the exciting boss challenges, however, the interesting powers gained from them can actually prove pretty rewarding. But with the sheer frustration of dealing with all the mechanical issues that Mega Man X7 presents, it's likely that most gamers will view these battles as an unpleasant errands instead of privileges. Though to be fair, there some genuinely entertaining moments between the troublesome areas -- you just have to know how to look for them.   Graphics  From a stylistic standpoint, the Mega Man X series has certainly seen better days. As wacky as some of the locations are, the stage and character design is pretty generic by franchise standards and there's been better examples of artistry in the MMXversions of old. That said, the team at Studio 3 has still done a respectable job of moving the sprite-based world of Zero and Sigma into a 3D environment. As the robots themselves are made up of a healthy number of polygons and the pseudo cel-shading technique used for textures works pretty well.   As mentioned in the gameplay section, though, the automatic camera system has more than its fair share of problems. Extreme close-ups and bizarre perspective skews make navigating the 3D portions of the game particularly frustrating. Because of this, there are too many instances where players are attacked by enemies that they didn't even see or areas where they'll fall off ledges that weren't obviously cut short. It's an occurrence that plagues just about every level, and one that creates more problems than not. Oh and did we forget to mention the slowdown? We should have, because that's in there too.   It should be noted, however, that the anime cut scenes and manga-inspired story segments are nicely put together. While they're certainly not the best that the series has seen, they do offer up a nice diversion between stage goals and the poorly designed menu screens.    Sound  Without a doubt the single most disappointing aspect of Mega Man X7, the audio is severely lacking. Plagued with a somewhat generic soundtrack and nary an impressive medley, the futuristic rock and occasional techno beats are far from memorable. Though we do have to give the team props for reusing classic sound effects of days gone by, they come across as just that: tin-can rips from the eight-bit era without any modern processing. To be truthful, we heard most of these same audio bits when we played the original Mega Man X in 1993.   What bothered us the most about the audio, however, is the absolutely terrible voice acting. Among the worst we've heard on the PlayStation 2 so far, every English vocal track exudes amateurism. But not only is the quality of the acting poor, so too are the cuts between dialogue. Obviously pieced together from individual sound bytes, there's no real flow to conversation with uncomfortable pauses of nothingness and awkward mood changes for nearly every phrase. Luckily we can thank our lucky stars that the translators also saw fit to include the original Japanese track as well. And as you would expect, that one is pretty good.We can't help but think that Mega Man X7 would have been better-suited staying 2D. But until Capcom realizes that the better action-oriented 3D titles allow you to manipulate the camera whole-heartedly, future installments of the series will likely run into the same problems that this one did. And that's not a statement to be taken lightly.For fans of the franchise, though, Mega Man X7 will probably keep you busy for a weekend or two and definitely offers up a challenge both welcome and unwelcome. Unfortunately, we can only recommend the game to those with an undying patience or a passion for the series. Otherwise, there are plenty of other actioners out there that will provide far more fun than this.", "date": "Oct 15, 2003"}
