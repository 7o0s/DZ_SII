{"name": "SEGA Bass Fishing", "name_review": "Sega Bass Fishing", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/sega-bass-fishing", "text": "So you are thrust onto the bow of a Bass fishing boat, armed with a rod, reel and a host of lures at your disposal.  Visible, just slightly, underneath the surface of the water is a horde of Large Mouth (Black) Bass.  You select the lure, cast, and with the shrewdness of a veteran fisherman, you work the lure around submerged structure to catch the illusive fish.  If you know precisely what you are doing, have the lure and lure color correct, and can work the analog fishing controller much like a real-live rod & reel, you will not only snag fish, but you will snag bigger ones in more numerous amounts.  That is the premise behind Sega Bass Fishing (formerly known as Get Bass).  This game was originally a smash arcade hit based upon the famed Model 3 arcade board, and is now swimming its way to a Dreamcast near you!  First of, let me say that whileSega Bass Fishing is an arcade title, the fish show some very precise behavioral characteristics in the process.  Since live bait is not the order of the day, the AI of Sega Bass Fishing is geared toward the Large Mouth Bass' tendency to ignore lures if they don't dance and mimic things effectively.  Fortunately, the analog fishing controller offers up a very convincing brand of fishing control, replete with variable speed retrieval.  The reel also offers the ability to nose the reel, as if a rod was attached, and have the lure dance in or on the water as it would in reel (pun intended) life.  The rod also offers loads of feedback (requiring no additional Jump Pack) so you will feel strikes and the fish fighting to break your line with each rotation of the crank.  Sega Bass Fishing plays out amidst numerous fishing locales via a Practice Mode, an Original Mode and an Arcade mode.  In addition, there is statistical tracking of who has caught the most fish in weight.  As you progress, your ranking is based upon a point scoring system.  So long as you remain in the top ten, you can advance pass the Amateur Tournament.   The graphics in Sega Bass Fishing are very nice; what I would consider standard 3D, but the fish models are particularly stunning-as are the water effects.  The lures, the second most critical component of this game (the first being able to effectively fish them), are rendered to look just like the stuff found in your (or your Dad's) tackle-box.  There are catfish and turtles, as well as small baitfish-to spruce up the aquatic environment-in addition to sunken chests of treasure; which I have tried to snag to no avail.  The fact that Bass are ~cover~ fish, meaning they use structure as a means of concealment is effectively portrayed in this game.  Hence, the importance of the underwater structures.  During warm temperatures especially, these fish will retreat underneath piers, into fallen or sunken structures and will have to literally be ~lured~ out if you have any hopes of catching one.  Time of day factors into this environmental condition and should not be overlooked; especially since the game furnishes the player with an outdoor thermometer as a reference.   No matter what the weather or temperature, the younger (and therefore smaller) the fish are...the dumber they are.  (The big ones don't get that way by being completely stupid you know!)  Often times when you have found what are referred to as ~lunker~ sized Bass, you will see an old-fatty start taking particular interest in your lure, begin to move in its direction, and then, all of a sudden, some younger/dumber fish will swoop past and snatch the bait before you can land ~the big one.~  So it is important to know when to take that bait away from a throwback sized Bass, and re-cast to trap a lunker, especially since you have the benefit of seeing the fishes size underwater via the default camera.  In this game, just like in real life, size does count.  To help you along there is a lure usage tutorial that appears when the game is left idle.  It gives some great pointers on how to use the various types of lures.  As the game progresses, more of these lures are added to you tacklebox, and can be used whenever the player deems appropriate.  The sound files used in Sega Bass Fishing are typical arcade quality stuff.  They are lively, clear and plentiful; albeit a bit dull from an aural standpoint.  The beats and tunes are snazzy, but the sound quality of them is a bit tired.  The water sounds and the noises of the various baits in the water are nicely done.  The sounds can actually aid the player in knowing what it is they are doing ~right or wrong~ with their chosen lure.  There is also a voice announcer who remains somewhat comical in his calling of the tournament.  Nonetheless, he is not a nuisance at any point, though hearing him say ~Turn the rod right...turn the rod left...~ can get old after extended playtime.  What is nice are his exclamations of, ~It's coming near~ and ~Bite it!~  They are nice cues that something is nearby.  There is much fun one can have playing several rounds of Sega Bass Fishing.  This is arcade fun the way it was designed to be.  Most certainly it is a game that many a ~new~ gamer could cut their teeth on,.  Moreover, it is one that can appeal to almost anyone.  Besides where else can you catch huge Bass like these without awaking at 2:00AM and having to eat cold wet sandwiches for lunch?  -- Fabian Blache III, Contributor", "date": "Oct 2, 1999"}
