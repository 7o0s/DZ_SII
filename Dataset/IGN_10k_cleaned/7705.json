Already a substantial hit in Gamevil's native Korea, NOM employs the one-button game play mechanics that IGN Wireless celebrated last year by awarding Skipping Stone the Mobile Game of the Year. Like Skipping Stone, NOM is instantly playable to anybody with a cell phone and a thumb. And like Skipping Stone, NOM is full of personality, thanks largely to purposely spartan graphics.   In NOM, you control the jumps of the incessantly sprinting hero. He's so limber and so fast that not even walls can stop him -- he just runs straight up them. And along ceilings, too. To keep up with NOM, you either need to be adept at tracking his around-the-screen movements, or just rotate your handset so it always looks like he's running on the ground. NOM even changes direction, so don't get used to him just running around the screen the same way every level.    NOM must jump over pits, leap through hoops of varying heights, and confront itty-bitty bad guys. Depending on how long you press the OK key determines the height of his jump. A high hoop requires a longer press than a narrow pit.   And that's pretty much it.   If you liked Skipping Stone, then you're probably already scouring your deck for NOM by now. It's an incredibly accessible game, and the austere look really makes it stand out from the crowd. But, from some, NOM may not offer enough varied game play to hold their interests -- which is completely understandable. But never mistake NOM for looking too easy. It's not, especially if you juice up the difficulty level.  As a fan of one-button games, especially Skipping Stone, I'm really digging on NOM. The look is quite unique, and in my opinion, very appealing. The bright colors really pop off the screen and NOM's animations are silky smooth. My only substantial complaint: The game is too short. Way too short. But played in short bursts, as most mobile games are, NOM is offers some fun challenges that I think many, many gamers will enjoy. Check it out.", "date": "Nov 30, 2006"}
