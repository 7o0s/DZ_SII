New millennium sleuthing, what with blood spatter patterns and semen-soaked sheets, is obviously gripping pop culture. Gameloft smartly sniffed out this trend before the bandwagon and brings mobile its first forensic adventure: Special Crime Unit.   Somebody has watched their fair share of CSI reruns at Gameloft. SCU is bubbling with oblique Grissom-esque dialogue, brutal violence, and meticulous crime scene combing. Much like the cult DS hits Phoenix Wright and Trauma Center, SCU fudges a few details and simplifies a few tasks for the sake of smooth gaming, such as turning painstaking DNA workings into a memory-style mini-game, turning over cells two at a time to pair off like-colored strands. Is it realistic? No. But it's necessary to make this stuff accessible to the five-minute mobile gamer.   SCU follows a murder investigation. A young woman has been found dead in a hotel room -- one which is she has apparently frequented with more than one gentleman caller. Her throat has been slashed, her mouth severely brutalized, and her body savagely beaten. Her last five minutes were nothing any of us would want to experience. As a new member of the SCU team, you must work with detectives and lab scientists to collect evidence, interrogate suspects, and discover the identity of the young woman's killer. The story is engaging and anybody that starts the game will want to see it through to completion, just to know exactly whodunit.   The structure of the game sends you all over a fictionalized San Francisco, bouncing between the crime scene, police labs, the morgue, and the interrogation room. You use tools like powder, a UV lamp, and tape to collect evidence at the hotel and then shuttle it back to the lab to compare samples and figure out what was the murder weapon and who was in that hotel room (and when) on the fateful night. For example, you use an on-screen pointer to scan the hotel room bathroom early in the game. The pointer zeroes in on a footprint next to the window. You then use the tape to pick up the print by running the cursor over the screen quickly.   Back in the lab, you play more timed mini-games to compare collected evidence and see if it matches up. Easy to access information archives let you check the evidence constantly and a streamlined system of objectives keep the story moving forward.   The interrogation sequences were favorites. The dialogue is well written and it doesn't pull any punches. There is no swearing or vulgarity, but these people talk like adults -- especially adults with questionable pasts and motives. As you quiz people like the hotel manager or the victim's sexual partners, you must watch a polygraph needle at the top of the screen. If they get nervous about a particular question or tell an unconvincing answer, the needle spikes into the red. Just like Phoenix Wright yelling ~Objection!~ you jump in and accuse them of withholding the truth. If you're fast enough, you can rattle them into spilling their guts. You may even get them to talk about spilling somebody else's guts, too.   SCU has multiple difficulty settings so you can go at your own pace. Honestly, the easy mode is just too easy. Skip it and go for higher difficulties. You'll have less time to complete the investigation and limit the number of accusations you can make.   Sometimes, the game almost too accurately recreates the busywork involved an in investigation. Certain lab sequences got a little dull and it felt like some things were being stretched out longer than necessary, such as revisiting locations to collect evidence you could have just picked up the first time. But anytime an interrogation was in play, SCU recaptured interest.   I downloaded SCU via a Sony Ericsson w810i on Cingular this week. The game looked great, with colorful scenery and nicely drawn characters. I was surprised that a carrier let Gameloft show the brutalized body in the morgue with a considerable amount of detail. Good music helps set the tone. Between scenes, you're treated to dialogue snippets from the different characters -- all of it a good read, even though they do repeat after a while. Little touches like that always good a long way.  Special Crime Unit is a good mobile adventure for gamers wanting something new on their handset. If you like games like Cooking Mama, Phoenix Wright, or Trauma Center, SCU is going to satisfy. I doubt many people will want to play it through multiple times, but that first play through is going to be worth the $5 to a gamer that likes CSI, cop dramas, or procedurals. I do, and thusly, I liked SCU. Recommended.", "date": "Jan 4, 2007"}
