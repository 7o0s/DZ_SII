HoverDM, as it was called, had specially made Quake 2 powered levels complete with hover bikes that controlled wonderfully and integrated into the base game marvelously. It was only then that the original SiN got the respect it deserved. It was only then that I learned the true potential of the vehicular-based first-person shooter.  Since that epiphany, every time I've sat down to play a title I've prefaced the experience by poising a few simple questions to myself and anyone else who happens to be in earshot: Where are the vehicles? When will I see the vehicles? How come I am not sitting in a vehicle? Can I drive that vehicle? Why are there no vehicles? Where are my crackers?  Games like Tribes 2 and Halo tore up the market, proving that my questions were not just my own. And, with the impending launch of the stellar looking Battlefield, the genre is really starting to heat up, clearly showing us what the scope of the meld between foot and wheel can mean for man (putting mines on the wing of a plane and then dive bombing it into a carrier while failing to inform the person in the backseat, for instance). So, it seems appropriate that a company like Rage, which prides itself on making some of the most intense arcade/action games around, would try its hand at the reigns.   Here's what's odd about Mobile Forces, Rage's team-based, online-centric first-person shooter with jeeps and peeps: It's the company's first effort at the FPS genre, and it shows. Despite all the shooting, the action, the platforming, and the so forth that the company has developed in its illustrious history, the game is as unpolished and unrefined a title as a first effort could ever be. It's a lot of neat ideas, but with little balance. It's like a pile of a cool with no Fonzarelli attached to it -- no perfected instrument that carries this cool around and lets other people enjoy it. Is the essence of cool without the vessel still good? Read on.  I got this game months ago, but it wasn't scheduled to ship stateside until...tomorrow, so I held off with the review, partly by choice, partly by force. See, it's hard to review an online action game when no one else but you is playing it. There were times when I'd get online and look for a server only to see nothing in the in-game browser. Thinking my game might be faulty or finicky, I'd vainly restart or attempt some other kind of hopelessly ineffective computer remedy. It wasn't until sometime later that I realized this title is simply not popular (released early summer in Europe). After giving it a few months, I gave up on the community and settled for what's there.   Imagine my non-surprise when I learned that what's there really, really sucks. Of the six servers that exist, none are functional. They all told me my version was out of date, and the ones that didn't couldn't because they were full (all one of them). Then, after patching the game, I was told that the servers were now the ones running an outdated version. So I figure there must be some kind of interim patch I missed. If only I could find the mysterious 1.05 patch that lies between 1.0 and 1.1.    Server issues were all provided I could first get the game to work properly. I had to do all kinds of bad stuff to get this puppy to go. Originally putting it on the computer and hitting the fangled setup buttons that come with fangled installation programs didn't work because the game didn't seem to like half of the systems I dared try to put it on (Windows XP, 2000, whatever). Then, after it installed on some of them the CD didn't feel like working on others (I guess sitting in a case for months is a dangerous thing to ask a game to do), so I eventually muddled through it by using a system I had installed it on weeks ago (cursing, kicking, and biting included).   The modes are pretty awesome, and are what you would expect to find in most games, but do not. Unfortunately, matches are still solo or team-based. That's not a problem, but what I don't like is that there are only two allowable teams per match, which means it's you vs. them, red vs. blue. Why more people don't pick up on some of the goodness that was found in UT (specifically domination) andcreater multiple team scenarios is beyond me.  Even without more than two teams ever being able to battle, taking on capture the flag, trailer (where commandeering a vehicle with an attached trailer and then dragging it into an enemy base is necessary) and others like captains (where killing the commanding fools of other teams is objective) and holdout (domination) is pretty cool. The problem is that even though the modes are sweet, other things about the game are not (namely weapons, graphics, networking, and community). If networking, weapons, graphics, and community are important those things are important to you, then perhaps you had better look someplace else, but if you relish vehicles and only vehicles, then here you can stay.        So there's a lack of character models (two that come in two colors), it doesn't matter, you can make up for a lack of individuality by cramming in a ton of levels, weapons, and vehicles. Whee...! No. There are only eleven maps, but each is compatible with every game mode, so that's at the very least an acceptable amount of configurations (even though most are typical FPS locales -- the classic warehouse with enormous boxes being my most cherished). But, there are only four vehicles and a scant few weapons. Out of the lot of pistols and projectile throwers, a weak three are useful.   The assault rifle is the all purpose gun and is also the one I regularly equip. This thing can obliterate enemies and flatten the tires of vehicles in no time (though it does little to no damage to cars themselves). I've found that I can jump out of a jeep after I've crushed a hundred people and use it to kill a hundred more with little effort at close to medium ranges. Then there is the rocket launcher, which essentially makes vehicles useless if you know how to the use the mouse and hit stuff on occasion. Finally, there are the devastating detonator packs that kill everything easily if armed and thrown in a defensive posture, (to destroy an incoming vehicle, as an example).   Other than that, everything else is completely useless. And by everything else, I mean all five of the other weapons (shotgun, pistol, sniper rifle, knife, grenades). There is the stationary machinegun, which serves a specific purpose in specific situations, like a holdout match, or when you feel like being a jerk and camping near an enemy spawn or choke point.   Assault rifle and rocket launcher it is. And you can combine the two to be completely lethal. The game comes with an inventory and not a class system, so you can hold whatever you can hold. The rocket launcher and assault rifle fit perfectly together, but it means you'll also be neglecting other necessities like armor or health. Nevertheless, it is always possible to make it back to your base at anytime and use the ammo crates to switch to another weapon or inventory setup. A kind of Global Ops inspired monetary system could have infinitely benefited Mobile Forces by adding importance to wins, losses, and the careful selection of equipment. But as is, the title usually quickly devolves into a race for the first vehicle so that everyone else can be crushed beneath it.   And this is where Mobile Forces shines. Even though the levels are atypical of the genre, they are large and suited perfectly for some keen driving only driving (no air or sea vessels here).   The cool thing is that unlike Battlefield, you can ride shotgun and fire with your own weapon instead of having to rely on the mounted weapons of the vehicle at hand. Sitting shotgun and throwing lead through the window is a lot of fun, especially when you can aim your weapon at your buddy in case he screws up and hits that ramp the wrong way.   But it's the physics that bring it all together. Some vehicles have a tremendous sense of speed, while others are a bit more lumbering, but all bounce, bound, flip, and fly in an arcadey and pleasing manner. Blowing tires can hamper performance and single lucky rounds to gas tanks can send your little buggy straight to a fiery grave.   Moving on to...horrific weapon models! Yeah, these graphics are bad, really bad (not even as good as UT). The levels are big, bland, flat, and dreary. The character models (all two of 'em) are standard, uninspiring, and ordinary. Effects are weak, except for vehicular explosions which cause all kinds of chunkiness to occur. Indeed, the vehicles are a bit better than the rest, but remain decidedly sub par, especially considering what we've seen in other games of late. Then there are the weapon models that I touched on earlier. Sweet horror, these are perhaps the ugliest weapon models I've seen in years. It'd be better to not even have them. The blockiness, blandness, and awkwardness is truly quite awful. And it doesn't even run that well! Don't even look at the minimum specs. Stay well above the recommended and you'll do fine, maybe.     Turn off the voice comments and the game sounds fine. Surround sound (positional audio) is solid, if for a few strange anomalies on Audigy and SB Live cards that cause vehicle emissions to stutter and skip from back to back or back to front.  Terrible bot AI rounds out the game, which is strange given Rage's commitment to deliver what they were boasting would be the solid multi and singleplayer experience to beat.   Characters stand around and wait to be crushed by your many vehicles. They spawn and run in random lines, get easily mixed up, clump together, blow up their own vehicles all the time, choose improper weapons, and generally poorly recognize and counter what you're doing. My favorite instance was when a jeep fell into the water of Sawmill and six, yes six of my cohorts jumped in after it, vainly trying to enter and use the vehicle even though it couldn't move at all. At least buddies on your team, as well as those on the opposing, will hop in and ride shotgun from time to time, but that doesn't make up for the grievances. And yes, I did play on the easiest and hardest modes.  What did you think of Mobile Forces?  Finally, network codes seems a bit spotty, even after the patch and considering that I'm probably playing people very far away on God knows what kind of servers (hopefully a peer-to-peer setup where one machine is actually running the game while it's serving) the game is still a sporadic performer that's likely not for the 56k limited.   It doesn't have the scope of Battlefield, the precision and demanding nature of America's Army, nor the graphics of Unreal Tournament 2003. In fact, it doesn't have any of the above from any of the above in any combination you can make from any of the above. Ha, it's a competitor that doesn't compete. But, Mobile Forces does have very small amounts from each game -- small amounts that combine to form a decent, if frustrating, incomplete, and lacking title.It's an okay game. You should try it, but don't buy it unless you like it. I'd say more, but I really don't want to.That is all.", "date": "Sep 9, 2002"}
