{"name": "Xbox Live Arcade", "name_review": "Super Collapse II", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/02/super-collapse-ii", "text": "Another puzzle game in the tradition of Tetris, Super Collapse II requires that you remove same-colored blocks in an attempt to clear the board. Rather than fitting dropping pieces, your access is only to the blocks already in place. Click on any set of at least three adjacent same-colored blocks and they disappear, dropping the blocks above and possibly setting off a chain reaction.   After a few seconds a new row of blocks appears below. You can see which colors will appear by watching the meter fill with the upcoming blocks. It's an interesting way to both measure the time before the next row emerges and to plan ahead for the blocks that are coming.   Super Collapse II is the Jenga of puzzle games. You pull pieces out and watch the puzzle collapse in on itself. Because you are barely manipulating the blocks, this feels like one of the least involving puzzles games I've ever encountered. While it's addictive and include four different game types (all of them pretty good), it just isn't as addictive, as fun, or as engrossing as Tetris or Bust-A-Move. There's enough meat here to merit the price, but be aware that you aren't getting one of the kings of the puzzle industry -- and it's single-player only.", "date": "Nov 2, 2004"}
