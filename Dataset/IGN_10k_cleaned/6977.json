With ESPN X Games Pro Boarder, Radical Entertainment is attempting to chip out their own chunk of the PC sports market as well as tackling a number of large licenses.  And it looks like they've accomplished both of their goals as Pro Boarder is more than just a vehicle for big names and product placement ... it's also just plain fun.      Pro Boarder lets you compete in a variety of snow boarding events from the high-flying SuperPipe to the blazingly fast Midnight Express. Overall there are nine different events to compete in and, while there is a bit of repetition in gameplay (most boil down to downhill racing, performing midair tricks, or a combination of the two), each has enough character to keep you going for the gold.  Of course, the main thrust of this game is to get vertical.  X Games Pro Boarder is all about catching some massive air and doing the big tricks.  The game features over 2000 special moves, everything you can think of from backside 1080 3X frontflips to boneless tail grabs.  Pro Boarder stars some of today's hottest snowboarding greats, most of whom you'll recognize if you've ever tuned in to the X Games on ESPN.  You can pick to compete as Tina Basich, Shannon Dunn, Daniel Franck, Terje Haakonsen, Morgan LaFonte, Peter Line, Jamie Lynn, or Todd Richards.  Each of these riders is based on their real-life counterparts and are rated on four stats: speed, spin, aggression, and jumping.  Each rider also carries over their real-life product licenses into the game and you can outfit each with their endorsed boards, which are rated in terms of speed, carving, and tricks.  Obviously you'll want a fast board for downhill competitions, but it takes a more discerning taste to pick the perfect board for the half pipe and other stunt events.  If you go all out on a trick board then you'll sacrifice the speed you need to get a good launch and you won't be able to complete the really sick tricks.  However, take a board that's extremely fast but has a low trick rating and you might not be able to land any of those McTwists.   Although it took a while to get used to, I was actually surprised at how well Pro Boarder handled and how nice the physics engine felt. You really get a feel of being on a snowy surface as you skid, slide, and cut your way through the frozen terrain.  The default keypad setup is rather awkward, but after a quick remap of the buttons I was shredding the slopes with the best of them.  One great thing about this game is that it is just challenging enough to keep you entertained without becoming too frustrating.  In the racing events you obviously want to be the first to the finish line, but in most events it's your point total that counts in the end.  You can score points by completing tricks, with harder tricks earning you higher point totals.  For example, a rail slide might be worth 100 points while a 720 method to judo can bring in upwards of 500 points.  Each of the events is difficult to win in the beginning, but you get better with practice and eventually you'll be rubbing your competitor's noses in the snow.  And if you get stuck on a particular event you can just move on to another one and come back later.  Although you won't be able to access all of the events at the start of the game, you'll unlock more as you win more coveted gold Xs.  And just like real-life, the computer AI has its good runs and its bad runs.  A score that didn't qualify in an earlier round might win you the gold later.    With the big name boarders, equipment, and the ESPN X Games moniker, Radical has loaded this game with licenses, and the soundtrack is no different.  Pro Boarder features hard and heavy tracks from Pennywise, the Foo Fighters, Rancid, Lunatic Calm, the Voodoo Glow Skulls, NoFX, the Bouncing Souls, Pulley, and Chixdiggit that will have you rocking as you flip through the air violently pressing buttons in an attempt to pull out just one more trick before nailing the perfect landing.  Unfortunately, while the soundtrack is great, the effects are sparse and repetitive.  It's a nice sentiment, but if I have to hear that damn crowd cheering anymore I'm going to fly into the stands and take some of the fans out with the tip of my board.  I ended up just turning the sound effects off and pumping up the CD tunes.  For those of you who want to compete head-to-head against your friends in Pro Boarder, you can play against 7 others over a variety of connection types including IPX, TCP/IP, modem dial-up, or serial direct connect.  We tried multiplay in the office and we had no problems whatsoever setting up a game.  Let me tell you, smoking your buds on the half pipe is a blast.  Pro Boarder offers up a great deal of simple fun and it actually was entertaining enough to keep me coming back for more even after putting the controller down for (what I thought was going to be) the night.  The problems that plagued the PlayStation version (slow down, dropped frames, and poor music reproduction) are eliminated on the PC and Radical has proven that a game company can actually make a big license game that's a lot of fun too.  If you're looking for a high-action sports game that is a little different from the rest of the pack then I suggest you drop in and give Pro Boarder a try.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Feb 9, 1999"}
