The massive glut of crap that is unleashed upon the unknowing public is frightening. So many games today are just so mediocre and bland that I can't help but rip on them. I know programmers work their butts off making these games. To us, it's garbage, but these programmers love their babies, they really do. And bad developers can make good games -- just look at Kronos Digital. Dark Rift? Cardinal Syn? Poop on a cart and CD. But then came along Fear Effect, and all was made good. For some, it may simply be a case of finding the right genre...Well, Promethian Designs, racing is not your genre. Renegade Racers boils down to a simple, repetitive racer that lacks any innovation or fun. Everything from the weapon designs to tracks, characters to vehicles, is just average. And I'm tired of average games. If I'm going to slap down 50 bucks, I damn well better get something more than par for my buck, and RR is not above par.GameplayRenegade Racers was originally designed as a sort of boat/hovercraft kart game, but heck if I noticed any difference that makes. It feels just like Mario Kart but with water textures on the road. Plus, you race so much off the water that it makes no sense why they bothered making boats at all. The game puts you in the shoes of one of 12 characters (6 are locked out at the start) , and their respective racing machines. They range from a sub-driving alien to a tank-driving general. ~But Sam,~ you say. ~I can't handle it when different vehicles have even the most subtle differences in handling, acceleration, or top speed! I go nuts and just start bashing my head into the wall over and over, shouting 'Wanna watch Wapner!'~ Chill, Rain Man, you won't have any problems controlling these vehicles. Although they look different, they all control the same.Your standard variety of competition modes are available: the championship mode (called Arcade), the single-track (called Quick Race), a High-Score Race, and Party Play (where you and a bunch of friends race around for a preset amount of time). Arcade mode simply takes you through 40 levels, most of them repeats of the same level with different objectives (i.e. jump 300 yards and finish 1st place), but this is simply a ploy to make it seem like there are more levels in the game, and eventually just ends up boring the player to death.GraphicsRenegade Racers' developer Promethean Designs is at least starting out with a nice racing track record graphics-wise. While nowhere near the level of uberpimps Naughty Dog's Crash Team Racing, the graphics are solid, with only a few instances of texture nastiness that pop up from time to time. Otherwise, they're usually rather smooth and varied. The game also moves at a pretty slick framerate, even when the other racers are on-screen and firing on their effects-driven weapons, with no real instances of slowdown. However, the actual track designs themselves are lame and unimaginative, with no shortcuts or ways to make up lost ground. The effects on the weapons are good, but they're nothing spectacular. Likewise, the weapons themselves are a standard as can be. You've got rockets, shields, turbo, and mines. They're a  clichd as hell, and it's obvious no real effort went into designing them. You can snag multiple boosts for longer speed bursts,  multiple shields for to make your ship invisible, or multiple rockets to turn them into heat-seeking variations, but they're still your standard turbos, shields, and rockets.SoundRR's sound may be the most aggravating area of all. Whenever the racers fire off a weapon, or pick one up, they shout out their particular catchphrase. That's right, EVERY TIME. You get to hear their little blurb about 20-30 times a race, and it's instantly annoying. The other effects are just as canned. They're the same thing you've heard in countless other kart-style racing games, and they just serve to move the game further into mediocrity.Likewise, the music is just average, if a little annoying. It fits the races (in a sort of CTR-ish, happy, plucky way), but it won't move you or anything.Renegade Racers is about as average as they come. The tracks are lame, the graphics are only slightly above par, and the characters are annoying. There are way too many games out there like this, and this is a bargain bin CD if I've ever seen one.", "date": "Mar 17, 2000"}
