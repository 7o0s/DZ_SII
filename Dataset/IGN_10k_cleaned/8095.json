Hot Shots Golf first debuted in the US on the PlayStation in mid-1998, and its follow-up hit shelves roughly two years later. Hot Shots Golf 2 is now available for download via the PSP through the PlayStation Store, and though the game is nearly seven years and two generations of consoles old, it still holds up pretty well.   The game uses the rather standard three-click swing interface. That is, you press X once to start the meter, a second time to set the power and a third to set accuracy. It's an arcadey system to be sure, especially when compared to the analog swing mechanics that many of today's golf games employ, but it still works quite well. The meter itself is drawn rather thin and the hot spot areas are tiny, which isn't helped much by the PSP's relatively small screen, so nailing a perfect shot will take a decent bit of practice. At the same time though, the game is forgiving enough that so long as you come close to hitting straight, you won't be too far off.   Aside from the swing mechanic, you're able to check your swing on the ball, zoom in and out of the hole, aim your shot and, of course, change your currently selected club. All of this works rather well, with the camera zoom functions set to the Triangle and Circle buttons. It would have been nice to see an option to jump right out to the landing spot without having to zoom or the ability to reset your aiming once you start adjusting, but both are overcome without much problem.    Being that this is a rather old and arcadey golf title on an underpowered system, we didn't expect realistic physics to begin with, but these are really about as basic as you could get. While hills, terrain and wind all do play a part in how your ball moves and rolls, it all seems somewhat mechanical. That is, there isn't a whole lot of subtlety here - it's either rolling down a hill or it's not. It's not quite as black and white as that, but it's close. While this is perfectly fine for arcade-esque golf titles, we did find a tad bit of an inconsistency with how the ball would react, usually when putting. The ball would sometimes have more of a problem climbing hills or it would roll rather downhill than at other times. It was never bad enough to ruin the experience, but we figured that we'd lose a shot or two during the round to unpredictable physics behavior.   Hot Shots Golf 2 has a number of modes, including a tournament mode that takes you through the four seasons and a Vs. mode where you play against a single computer opponent. The Tournament mode will allow you to unlock new clubs and balls, each which have their own abilities, while the Vs. mode lets you unlock new characters. Unfortunately, you can't actually modify or upgrade your character's abilities as this is strictly tied to the equipment. Because of this you lose the feeling of maturing your golfer and improving his or her skills over time. Aside from that though, the Tournament mode does provide a pretty reasonable single-player experience.   One disappointing thing about the PSP's current ability to play PSone games is that it doesn't allow for multiple controllers in any way, be it via Ad-Hoc or whatever, so the multiplayer functions of most games is unusable. Fortunately however, Hot Shots Golf 2 allows for hot seat play, so you can play with up to four players on a single PSP simply by setting each of their assigned controllers to #1.Hot Shots Golf 2 has stood the test of time really well. It may not have the greatest physics engine around, but it's fast, charismatic and, most importantly, fun. There are better golf experiences on the system, but for the low price of a PlayStation Store download, you'd be hard-pressed to beat the value.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
