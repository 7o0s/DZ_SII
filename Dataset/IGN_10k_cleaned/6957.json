The sleepy, off-the-beaten-path burg where Lightning McQueen makes an unexpected pit stop serves as the primary setting for the Cars mobile game. The game is a sorta-sequel to the movie, since from the get-go, Lightning already has established relationships with some of the cars, such as Mater.   Lightning has returned to town to see his old friends on the way to another race. Apparently, everybody has been stockpiling errands and such for Lightning's eventual return, because from the moment he arrives back in town, every auto has a favor to ask. The game is one long string of missions that take place inside and around the city, in the high desert that hosts Route 66.   There had to be some level of Grand Theft Auto inspirado when mDisney assembled Cars -- the open structure of the game with multiple missions to be picked up at any time by just wheeling up to another anthropomorphic car and initiating conversation. There's even an on-screen map of the city with blinking icons that show where you can pick up new missions. This sandbox-style has not been attempted very often with a mobile game, and it kinda wigs me out that the biggest example is a Disney game based on an animated movie. But it wigs me in a good way, because this kind of larger thinking is truly required to advance the ball.   The missions are nice and small, easy for mobile consumption. Whether you are on fetch quests or races, you can chart a little progress with each login, pick up some extra bolts (which act as the Cars currency), and maybe even earn an extra technique or bonus.   Now, not everything is postcard perfect in Radiator Springs. Some of the missions are downright dull and the races are on the easy side. I recognize that the audience for this is likely younger players, but every time I go see a Pixar movie in the theaters, over half of the joint is full of grown-ups. So, while I wouldn't necessarily recommend for other 30-year-old gamers, I could definitely see this being downloaded and passed on to a young'un having difficulty waiting for the movie to start.   I downloaded the game on an LG VX8000. The environments are large and full of vibrant colors and great detail. The cars are very recognizable from just the overworld screens, but even so, where you get in another grill, portraits of the cars appear alongside dialogue. The sound is OK -- nothing terribly special, so if you opt to turn it down, you'll miss very little.  Cars is a solid game skewed for younger players -- and that's how I'm going to rate it. I know that while I appreciated some of the mechanics (pun intended), I'm not the intended audience -- which is why some of the missions were just too easy. So, if you're kid-less, dont bother with this detour. However, if you have a younger player with a set of fingers just itching to hold your cell, this is a good download that offers light-hearted, suitable entertainment.", "date": "Jun 3, 2006"}
