After a discovery there comes one last garbled message-danger, danger  clich approaching--~have opened Pandora's box... all the evils of old Mars have flown out,~ and a warning, ~...if you do send a manned mission, warn the crew...Stay Alone, Stay Alive...~ then nothing.  So now it's 2018, your rescue mission to Mars-we call this irony where I come from-crash lands.  When you get to the base the welcome wagon is made up of zombies and an alien virus that will make you look back fondly on the days of the Black Plague.  You control a team of three: Kenzo, Karne and Matlock.  They enter the base from different airlocks and try to discover what happened.  The reason for the whole ~Stay alone, stay alive~ warning is that if your team members come together they end up forming into a disgusting mass of flesh -- picture the thing from Leviathan -- called a Trimorph. As you proceed though the base you find clues as to what occurred. That and lots of corpses.  Funny thing though, these corpses don't seem to want to stay dead. Call me prejudiced but zombies tend to be about as bright as a Jerry Springer audience and just as vicious.  In addition to them you run into Trimorphs, some of the non zombiefied former base crew, that are bent on your destruction.  They come in two sizes -- the small spidery kind which hack at your shins and jump on your face or the huge ~better run like hell~ monstrosities that will tear you to pieces.You spend the game collecting weapons, door key tags and the other bits and pieces of equipment that are laying around. You'll also find out a little about the research that was going on at the base.  Some of this hinkfo comes from The Mood, an AI that runs the base a la HAL9000 and which Kenzo is a specialist in interfacing with. I think I just used up all my prepositions for this paragraph. The Mood is full of information so take advantage.  This game is challenging to say the least so I recommend taking notes.  Finding your way through the base, figuring out what the hell happened, avoiding the baddies and trying to get home will keep you playing on the edge of your seat for quite some time.Martian Gothic: Unification is set up in the third person, so it's like watching a film. Overall the effect is very positive. The game looks great, the photo like detail in the backgrounds really impressed me, and the cinematic feel is nice, though the some of camera angles can be tricky when fighting.  I found that the low angle shots in some of the settings made it difficult or impossible to see who or what I was shooting at but the effect is worth it overall.  This is a truly picturesque game. I also really liked the cutscenes. They're not so far from the quality of the game graphics that you sitting there thinking, ~Wow, I wish the rest of the game looked this good.~The sound is excellent.  The music -- thankfully not the usual rave/techno that I immediately turn off -- is moody and suspenseful and adds much to the experience.  The sound effects are clean and the 3D surround really comes through.  The weapon and creature sounds are well executed the  nail gun sounds just right, zombie moans are creepy and the roar of the big Trimorph creatures is terrifying.  Also the Foley sounds, opening doors, footsteps, reloading a gun, etc. are all good.  Let me tell you from personal experience, that when you turn a corner and a zombie grabs you and starts gnawing on your neck, punctuated by the music, you will jump -- especially at three in the morning.  Character controls, all keyboard, are difficult at times.  Learning to move through the base at a run can be the difference between life and death.  And speaking of death, there are computers situated throughout the base -- usually in a room with a zombie -- and these are the only places where you can save your game. Since there are only so many save spots at each station you'd best use them wisely.  It's best to try to do as much as possible between saves which can be a hard call because if any of the characters dies the game is over.  Then you have to start at the last save spot. Sigh... A magnifying glass icon that appears in the corner of the screen if you can do something like examine dead body, search dead body, open door, use computer, etc.  But trying to open a door with a zombie right behind you can be really nerve-wracking and -- if you aren't fast enough -- deadly.  It doesn't take long to get used to the controls but under pressure it's never easy.Overall Martian Gothic: Unification has a lot to offer.  The sound and graphics are high quality, the story -- though seemingly cobbled together from many different sci-fi plots -- is engaging and keeps you guessing. Most of all it's damn fun shooting zombies.  The only real drawbacks are some control difficulties and awkward view angles.  But let this be a fair warning, this game is hard -- especially the last third. Be ready to invest a lot of time in order to see it through to the end.--Duncan Turner", "date": "Jun 7, 2000"}
