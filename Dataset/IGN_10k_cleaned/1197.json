{"name": "Sydney 2000", "name_review": "Sydney 2000", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/29/sydney-2000", "text": "The Olympics have been a global tradition since 1896 (sure, the Greeks had been doing it for years before that, but they didn't invite any of us), bringing together top athletes from around the world to compete for the apex of international athletic honors.  While there have been a few titles over the years that have tried to capture the competitive spirit of the Olympics, most notably Summer Games and Winter Games from Epyx way back in the mid-80s and The Games series from Accolade in the early-90s, we haven't seen many games that have simulated the pinnacle of sporting events.  Now Eidos and ATD are trying to recapture that spirit with Sydney 2000, just in time for the millennium games.   As you can probably imagine since the Playstation title was released shortly before the PC version, Sydney 2000 owes a lot to its console counterpart.  Unfortunately, the development team just didn't do much to the port to take advantage of the PC's power and give it that PC feel.  For example, when you begin the game, you have to enter your name by selecting scrolling letters.  I have this 104-key keyboard in front of me and I still have to select my name with the arrow keys?  Bah!  Sydney 2000 does offer you a variety of different play types in twelve events: 100 meter sprint, 110 meter hurdles, javelin, hammer, triple jump, high jump, skeet shooting, 100 meter freestyle swimming, 10 meter platform diving, weight lifting, sprint cycle, and kayak K1 slalom.  You can choose from Arcade mode, Olympic mode, Head-to-Head, or Coaching.  Arcade mode lets you jump right into the events with a trained athlete, Olympic mode requires you to train an athlete and qualify for the big game, and Head-to-Head lets you compete against your friends...but more on that later.  The Coaching feature allows you to practice the events, and it will really help you most with your performance in the racing events since you can race against a ghost of your best time to date.    The majority of the game mechanics are comprised of nothing more than pressing the arrow keys for power and hitting the ~enter~ key to perform an action (or whichever keys you assign on another controller).  It's just a combination of the same keystrokes for all twelve events, making gameplay repetitive and, for the most part, unfulfilling since you're only using three keys during 99% of the game.  While it can be fun for short periods of time (you're competing in the Olympics for Christ's sake), it doesn't hold your attention for very long, especially if you're a skill player.  It's a mash, mash, mash game that requires no finesse, and it's going to be responsible for lots of broken keyboards.  Like I mentioned before, you can't just jump into the Olympic Games and compete right off the bat.  For every event you want to participate in, you have to go through a long and tedious training process.  As if the gameplay weren't repetitive enough, you have to go through round after round after round after round of training before you actually get to heave a javelin or dive into an Olympic pool.  More often than not your enemy will be the dreaded ~Tread Mill,~ a beast with a two foot rotating belt and bright, flashing lights that you'll encounter more than 15,000 times in this game.  Sure, the training portion is realistic and adds a little bit of depth to the game, but do you have to make it as boring, tedious, and monotonous as real exercise?  To make matters worse, you'll also have to listen to the exact same repetitive techno track every time you train for an event.  It's enough to make you turn your speakers off if you're trying to get through the training for more than one athlete at one sitting.  Speaking of the audio, there's just not much to it.  Aside from a few cheers from the crowd, the sound of chirping crickets, and the repetitive music, your ears won't be privy to much else except for the dynamic color commentary.  While the commentary is well recorded and sounds fine, it has its problems, the worst of which is that sometimes it doesn't match what's on the screen, like the announcer will say you have to improve after you've just beaten a record.  Hey buddy, I think I did pretty well, thanks.  I also wasn't too impressed with the balancing and challenge of the game.  In one event at an invitational event, all of the athletes beat the world record in the high jump.  This just wouldn't happen in real life.  And I found it incredibly easy to beat the world record in nearly every event during the Olympics my first time out.  While it made me feel good to be the best in the world, it was too easy, and you really don't feel like you had to work to hard at it.   Visually, Sydney 2000 is pretty average for a PC game.  Although there's not much variety in the characters, they do look nice for low polygon models (well, lower than most other modern PC games), and I was impressed with how smooth the animation was, even on slower systems.  It was a disappointment that you couldn't pick your own models, though.  Your country selection determines what models are used for each event, and you get no say so in the matter.  The Olympic arena itself looks nice as well, but it's rather sedate.  Besides the characters models, the bounce of the blurry, flat crowd in the background, and the occasional bird flapping overhead, there's not much going on.  Of course, this does keep the framerate up.  One feature that impressed everyone who watched the game were the numerous camera angles from which you can watch the action.  Attention to Detail really captured the televised look of the Olympics in Sydney 2000, and when you check out the screenshots below you'll see what I mean.    As fun as it could have been, the Head-to-Head mode just isn't made for the PC.  While up to four players can compete in the twelve Olympic events, there's no Internet or LAN options, so you have to get all comfy and cram around the same computer.  To make matters worse, every competitor has to have their own controller...there's no keyboard sharing here.  So unless you have four input devices, you're S.O.L.  It's too bad because I think Internet play is where Sydney 2000 would have really shined.  Think how cool it would have been to compete against people around the world...just like in the real Olympics.  While I was a big fan of Track and Field in the arcade and Epyx's early Olympic games, Sydney 2000 just comes out bland and uninspired in comparison.  Unfortunately, what could have been a great game ultimately falls to the level of mediocrity due to a poor and monotonous control system and lack of Internet play.  It is strangely addictive though and, if you decide to try it out, you'll find yourself wanting to go through just a few more of the horrible training exercises to get your athletes ready for the big event.  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
