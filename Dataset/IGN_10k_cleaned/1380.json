It's a mystery really. Why is the US really the only country that doesn't go bonkers over the sport? It's funny too, considering tons of people played soccer from an early age including myself. But do we watch it? Usually only if it's World Cup time. But there is one little sliver of hope for the sport in the lazy ol' US of A, and it comes in the form of a computer game called FIFA 2001.  There are a lot of people I know that, while they don't really like watching soccer or are too lazy to go out and play, will jump at the chance to show their prowess on a computer screen. What better way to go about that than with EA's soccer series FIFA? It's been around for years and shows plenty of polish and always has a few new tricks and catches to bring hardcore fans back to buy the next year's game. Which brings us to the question that most fans have every year: is the game different enough to warrant buying the new version. I'll try to answer that for you over the review.  First off on the list of changes is also the most apparent. The game received a bit of a facelift (almost literally) from previous years. Among other things, this year they've ramped up the player models, especially around the faces. They've instituted facial deformation to allow for more realistic close-up animations. The new models are definitely a step up from last year, even though the face deformations can make them look just that; deformed. But that is only when some of the models shout. Otherwise the face models are pretty well done. There were some pretty noticeable polygon scars on some of the bald players. But those are some minor gripes to otherwise nice models.  Player animations have really been improved here making the game look more realistic than ever. They are fantastic and when you're zoomed out like you are watching T.V., you could probably convince someone that they were watching real people. Having played soccer for as long as I did, it was definitely nice to see the time spent on animation details. Celebrations and the like are also pretty nice with smooth and realistic animations.  I just quickly have to add that the crowds really make me smile. It's not as if they are the best thing that will ever come out in video games, they are blurry up-close, but they add a necessary part of a FIFA title. The crowds are an enormous part of any soccer game in the rest of the world. And in this game, they are constantly moving around and cheering. There are those that would say that the crowd really isn't that important a thing, but then they've probably never been to a game anywhere else in the world. The fans are rabid for their soccer. Having an active crowd really makes the atmosphere come alive.  The sound also continues to impress with their intelligent commentary. It's really great to hear the John Motson and Mark Lawrenson make reference to how well your team is doing in a tournament, how well a particular player is doing in the game, and how the tone changes when one team starts to get a large lead. For those of you that just can't stand to have people talking over your game, EA has added the option to turn the commentators off and just listen to the crowd, the players talking on the field, and the grunt sounds from physical play. It's a nice touch and really makes the game experience a little more personal.  As far as gameplay goes, what you'll notice most is a change in the pace of the game, brought on most by the increase in pitch. The field is really noticeably bigger this time around which will allow for more thinking and more strategic decision-making. And for most soccer fans looking for a more realistic experience, that is a good thing. For those of you that like your soccer fast and furious, you can still turn up the game speed. It may not be the same, but you'll still have to think really quickly.  There have been a couple of gameplay additions as well such as the new sprint model, that will make those breakaways less irritating. Although I have to say that I'm not terribly impressed with the defensive AI. I realize that you are supposed to take the helm in a big way in World Class mode (the toughest setting), but your defense does absolutely nothing. They will never try to help get the ball from a player, which can tend to be a bit frustrating.  Another annoying little thing that irked me was the opposing defenses ability to slide tackle a person from behind from close to 3 or 4 feet away while still being able to cleanly take the ball away without a penalty, all while both players are running at a full sprint. I just don't think that's physically possible. Maybe I'm just out of shape, but I don't think I've ever seen tackles like that in a real game.   Now onto what is perhaps the biggest problem and most annoying thing with the game that I really wish would be changed. Why is there no option to reconfigure controls? I know that EA thinks that they have figured out the best way to do things. But it isn't for me; I wanted to switch some things around. Apparently, it can be done, but only by accessing the omenu from the field directly and changing things there, which is sloppy and sometimes easier said than done.  You also may be a bit disappointed by some of the leagues that are missing from the game this year -- most noticeable Brazil and Turkey. There apparently is some other party out there that owns the exclusive rights to these particular leagues. But don't worry, because there are still 17 leagues for you to sink your teeth into, complete with teams and rosters. And yes, MLS is certainly in there, so you can play with your favorite team.  Perhaps the biggest change and one of the big reasons to get out and buy the game is the added Internet multiplay functionality. Fans have been asking for this one for quite some time and they have finally gotten to a point where it was really feasible to incorporate it. Now you can play against friends, enemies, friendly enemies, or whomever you like.  But when all is said and done, what we're left with is a good, fun game that soccer fans all over the world will enjoy. There definitely have been some upgrades here that make the game worth a new purchase if you are a hardcore fan of the game. The increased pitch and graphics alone will probably appeal to you in a big way but the Internet play should be a big draw as well. Those who have been looking for a soccer game to buy should definitely give this one a look. After all, there is a reason that the FIFA series has emerged as the dominant force in soccer game. Maybe this game will help give soccer the boost it really deserves in the US.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
