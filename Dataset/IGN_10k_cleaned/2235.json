The appeal for a story based in such a complete world is immense mostly because anyone that takes part in the fiction, whether that be by reading a book or in this case playing a game, is drawn in deep enough to where reality fades away and a sweet sense that you really are taking place in a grand adventure starts to enfold you. There have been a few games over the years that have done this for me, but most of the time, they take place in the incredibly long RPGs that have the luxury of long scripts of dialogue to build a world. In the realm of the RTS, story telling gets to be a little harder to unfold as it has to be done in brief cutscenes and in the gameplay. StarCraft and Homeworld immediately come to mind along with the Myth series of games. Myth and Myth II generated such a moody land filled with turmoil and peril with some excellent voice over work and intelligent writing that I was immediately hooked by the premise and setting, and then by the addictive and challenging gameplay. So it was with some bit of eager anticipation that I loaded the newest game in the series, Myth III: The Wolf Age. I was happy to find that the game not only followed the rich background of storytelling from a new historic perspective, but also kept the gameplay that I and so many others enjoyed intact. Not all of the problems that many may remember are gone, and some new ones have arisen, but the overall package will still keep fans of the series satisfied.  The great history and story from the first two games are carried on in nice fashion with this third installment in the form of a prequel. If you play the first two games, then you'll remember the legend of Connacht the Wolf and his heroic efforts to save the world from the evil of the Myrkridia and the ultimate badass Moagim. But the story isn't told the same way as the first two games where you followed the story from the perspective of a soldier fighting through the various battles and wars. This time around the soldier and his nobly humble voice have been traded in for a historian's perspective. The ancient tomb of Connacht the Wolf has been uncovered along with all of the historical manuscripts found within. The game follows the readings of the events following Connacht and his rise from the Barbarian tribes to greatness. While I miss the voice from first two games (one of the best voice-overs ever in my humble opinion) the job done in Myth 3 is very good.  One of the most talked about features when the game was originally announced was the transfer of all of the art over to 3D. No more of those 2D sprites walking around in the 3D environments. No more pixelized trees and water... Myth 3 has managed to make the conversion to full 3D very well thanks to the efforts of Mumbo Jumbo's art team. There's a lot of detail in the model textures here that you'll appreciate. And if you have the luck of a GeForce 3, you're in for a real treat. If you aren't that fortunate, things don't look quite as sharp, but I still was amazed at the clarity and detail of the game when running without the GF3. There were some texture problems where bits would actually be missing on models, but those issues were few and far between. The animation in the game isn't the most impressive set you'll ever see, but the quality is good enough and shouldn't leave you disappointed.  The gore and blood factor is still a huge factor in the game as well. You'll still find all of the lovely little chunks of dwarf and ghol and trow and human and.. and.. and.... This is still one of the nastiest pieces of work created for the PC and thanks to some of the new units and abilities, it's actually even more prominent. Originally they had said that blood would actually flow down hill as well, but not having seen that happen myself, I'm not so sure. Maybe I just missed it, or maybe there's just so much blood and so much action that you can't really tell.  The gameplay will be instantly familiar to those that have Myth games in the past. You enter levels with a certain number of units and are required to finish the level with only those units and any reinforcements you might receive. There is no resource management here so that you can concentrate on the finer points of warfare like placement of troops, unit balancing, and line of sight. The variety of weapons and enemies in the game make for some serious thought when going into battle. The addition of various terrain types and whether also makes a large difference to gameplay especially when employing units that use explosives.  One sad fact that seems to have been taken away, or maybe there's a bug, is that unit experience doesn't look to carry over from level to level. I'm actually hoping this is a bug, because that feature was a big plus to my experiences in the last two games. Originally, units build experience and get quicker and more accurate every time they kill an enemy. But unfortunately I began most missions with totally fresh units even if the same type of units were used in the previous mission. Without having units carry over, the fear of losing important and experienced units goes away and so does your fear of losing them and sacrificing units becomes less of a tough decision. Sorry little archer guy, but you need to be fed to the mean old Trow now to buy some time for my demolitionists... sad little archer. I didn't even bother naming any of them this time around even though that feature is still there.  The difficulty level is still right up there (and harder if you have the same unit advancement problems that I did) and you'll have to do some serious thinking and unit management with formations and placement if you want to get through some of these tough missions. I'm actually a little mixed on some this. There were some really great missions in the game that I had some trouble with and had to rethink a few times, but there were some that just... seemed a little less thought out. I'm talking particularly about some of the hero missions when you take control of Connacht, Dumas, Ravanna, and Myrdred. These missions basically required you to rush every enemy you came across with the exception of a couple of basic puzzles that need to be solved. The hero missions in the last games took more planning and thought to use the heroes wisely. I only lost one of the heroes once and that was because I was a complete dumbass. But there are also some wonderfully fun maps that challenge you to attack and defend against great numbers of creatures causing some wonderful chaos.   The addition of a bunch of new units was also a very welcome one. Each of the different races in the game can actually put up a real fighting force this time around as all of them have at least three different units. Dwarves, Trow, Ghols, and the Myrkridia all have new units along with an entirely new faction, the creepy bastard Spider Cultists. The units for each of the races are pretty cool. Seeing a Trow clad in steel carrying a big hammer coming down the path is scary as hell. And the Ghol priest has a nasty little spell that causes all debris around the center to get swept up and swirl around causing damage to all of the units stuck inside. It can do a bit of damage to a large group if there are enough weapons inside, especially if there are explosives.  Along with the good stuff comes the not so good, so here it is. First off, load times. They can be brutal. I waited for three minutes on a PIII 600 for a save game to load up... I have no attention span. I can not handle this. And sometimes when the game did finally load up, there would be some serious engine problems causing the game to chug horribly slow for another couple of minutes before things could settle making the game impossible to control. Luckily the game also slowed to a crawl so that nothing happened in the meantime.  The AI seems to have gotten better in some cases, but not in others. Units still wander around trying to get to units they can't reach even if you've given a command to attack an entire group. Units will sometimes let units walk past them before attacking even if you've given the command to attack that particular unit. One good thing is that the area damage units such as the Dwarven Demolitionists (Buuuurrrn!) won't be so generous in handing out cocktails to your own troops in a messy melee. They'll do it if you tell them to, but I never saw one actually decimate the core of my own troops like in the first two games. Enemy AI is solid as well making some interesting decisions, coming from all sides (although most of that is scripted I guess) and picking primary targets wisely. There were several times when a couple of enemy units would break off from the main pack just to take out an archer, mage, or demolitionist.  And then there's the multiplayer. The addition of the new units should add to an already incredibly enjoyable experience. I can already imagine some very creative uses for the new units in the game. The balancing seems to be pretty good to me right now, but that's one of those things that can only really be seen over time and is also one of those things that can be fixed if necessary.  So I'm pretty happy. I got the chance to jump back into the Myth mythos and check out what happened before the triumphs in the first two games. Some unfortunate set backs, whether they were by design or bug dulled the experience a little bit, but not enough to hamper my enjoyment. Fans of the series shouldn't be disappointed by Mumbo Jumbo's effort to follow in the mighty footsteps that Bungie left behind.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
