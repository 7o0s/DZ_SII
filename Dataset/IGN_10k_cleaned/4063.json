Take fighting games for example. (In fact, take all of the cellphone fighting games and throw them in the river. Please.) The traditional scrolling shooter should be will within the cellphone's grasp, yet there's a dearth of quality blast-'ems to take on the go.  Enter Thumbworks. And enter Dragon Flight, their new side-scrolling shooter starring, well, great fire-breathing lizards -- in super-cute form. It's an attempt to resurrect a genre that has been practically flogged out of existence on cellies, thanks to a good two years of crap top-down shooters.  Features: Four challenging levels Four different dragons Several enemies Side-screen perspective  The first thing that sets Dragon Flight apart from the pack of crapola available for download is that it's a side-scrolling shooter. How is that possible on a cellphone? Most of these handsets have vertical-oriented screens. It's a very simple solution: turn the phone on its side. Suddenly, you have a nice, large playing field. One that allows the player to actually see enemies coming.  Why the hell didn't anybody do this before?  Control is easy with this set-up, too. Just like a SNES or Genesis controller, all of the action buttons are now on the right side of the handset, not directly below the screen where bananahands can get cramped up or cover part of the screen. You kinda feel like you're holding an Atari Lynx -- but sans about two pounds.  Now, not every phone does this -- some still play just on the vertical.  The game is a simple shooter. You pick from four dragons and take to the skies, zooming up and down. First, as an egg, you must avoid all hazards and try to collect as much meat as possible for points. Keep an eye on your position on the meter along the bottom of the screen. The further to the right you are, the closer you are to finishing the level. Soon, you sprout your wings and earn your fire breath, which can be used to knock other monsters out of the sky.  Is Dragon Flight revolutionary? Hardly. It's just fun, and it shows that the designers actually applied some thought to how to improve the standing of the genre in the limited tech space. The visuals are bright and colorful, as much as you could hope for in such a game. The audio is unfortunately very limited. While it does nothing to actually push the genre itself forward, Dragon Flight still serves as a good source of entertainment during a slow fifteen or so minutes. The decision to flip the phone on its side and increase the size/visibility of the playing field, though, is what impresses me most about the game. Maybe even more so than the game itself. And while I try not to be wowed by gimmicks, that kind of design thinking can hardly be considered a gimmick. It's the right step to keeping handset gaming relevant.", "date": "Oct 25, 2003"}
