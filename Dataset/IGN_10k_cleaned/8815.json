For every Simspons: Hit & Run, there's a Simpsons Wrestling or Virtual Bart just waiting to land. Minutes to Meltdown is the first time the Simpson clan has graced the smallest screen, and they do so in the shadow of their theatrical release. And while the mobile game isn't based on the events of the movie, it's certainly tied to the overwhelming marketing surrounding it.   Simpsons fans -- the kind that wait in a block-length line to check out a 7-11 refreshed as a Kwik-E-Mart -- are the core target for this game. The game does a tremendous amount of fan service, too, including visual in-jokes and wonderfully accurate renditions of well-known Simpsons characters and locations, such as the Simpson homestead and the nuclear power plant where Homer works. The color palette is dead-on. As you guide Homer through the city streets of Springfield (which is in Oregon, USA Today), the game really does take on the feel of an interactive episode... right down to the running time.   Yes, I was setting you up there, just like the crash that comes after the highs of a frosty Buzz Cola. Minutes to Meltdown excels on first impressions, but as soon as you have it on your handset, you'll find it as unwelcome as Homer in Ned Flanders' house.   The game is just too damn short to be even considered something of a value. You have thirty real-time minutes to get Homer from his house to the plant before the whole city goes thermal. In theory, it's not a bad idea. Mobile sessions are short by nature -- unless you find a hopelessly additive puzzler -- so breezing through a level in Simpsons in just six or seven minutes doesn't seem wrongheaded. But consider that there are only three levels in the whole game: Home, city streets, power plant. And once you've beaten the game, which you almost have to try not to, there only reason to replay is to see if you can best your previous time. Trust me, halfway through the second run, you'll wonder why you're bothering.   The mechanics are intriguing while they last. You must use thought bubbles and visual cues to figure out what to do next. When you spy Barney near the doors of the power plant, a little coffee cup icon appears over his head, hinting that you need to fetch a cup of joe to keep moving through the level. The picture-based puzzles and goals are actually good design. They test the mettle of fans. Where would Homer get a cup of coffee for Barney? The Kwik-E-Mart, of course. That's very rewarding game play.   It's just too bad the rewards end so quickly.I hope EA Mobile seizes the chance to try again, using the mechanics introduced here in a much longer game. The experience itself isn't remotely bad -- it's just unfairly brief. I certainly wasn't expecting an eight-hour adventure, but I also wasn't expecting twenty-five minutes, either. And it's that lack of longevity that brings the review score tumbling down.", "date": "Jul 24, 2007"}
