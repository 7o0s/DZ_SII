Certain standards carry over from title to title such as anime characters, tight control, and fast, yet manageable, action. Marvel Superheroes follows this pattern closely and the end result is nothing new, but a good fighter nonetheless.  This title is very similar to Capcom's X-Men Children of the Atom in art style and gameplay.  The characters are more diverse with favorites such as Captain America, Spiderman, and the Incredible Hulk interspersed with X-Men team members.  The gameplay is also altered with the addition of Infinity Gems.  These power-ups can increase characters' powers and attributes when used, adding a new strategy element to the action. Infinity Counters allow fighters to turn an opponent's biggest move right back at them, which keeps the action exciting for two-player action.  The fighting itself is standard Street Fighter action with several super-powered moves.  Players can jump or fly two screens up before crashing down to earth with a special attack.  This is sometimes confusing, but a nice break from the standard single screen action.  Not all is perfect with this title, however. When several special effects are on screen at the same time, the game slows down significantly. Also the super jumps can be hard to follow at times.  Other than these little problems, Marvel Superheroes manages to be an enjoyable, but nowhere near groundbreaking title. Fun, but not much that we haven't seen before.", "date": "Sep 30, 1997"}
