We old school gamers must face the sad reality that some of our favorite genres aren't financially viable mediums for publishers. We remember when a good shooter was about as common as a side-scrolling platformer. How we miss those simple days. Nothing could beat spending all your lunch money on the newest arcade game -- back when quarter munchers were just a single quarter, not three or four.Remember when nearly every console had its crown jewel shooter? Lords of Thunder, Axelay, Gaiares and Thunderforce III were all amazing games and still pass the test of time. We can't forget Aeroblasters or the Gradius series, either. The 16-bit era was the glory days for shooter fans, just like the early '90s were for fighting games.We played the above-mentioned games at home, but arcades weren't much different and actually had twice as many good shooters (SideArms, Raiden, Mission XX, and Twin Eagle, just to name a few). It wasn't so much about quantity but more about quality -- these games had a certain pedigree to them and are some of the best shooters we've ever seen or played.Enter Treasure, a company known for not exactly going by the book in terms of design and art direction -- just look at some of its past products like Rakugaku Showtime or Stretch Panic if you don't believe us. Its latest game, Ikaruga, is a combination of Radiant Silvergun with gameplay ripped from Silhouette Mirage.The Facts Treasure-developed, top-down, old-school shooter Spiritual successor to Radiant Silvergun Forced-vertical scrolling No pick-ups or power-ups Unique Silhouette Mirage-inspired gameplay mechanic Three levels of difficulty Five different stages Supports true vertical mode, where players can turn their television sets on end and take advantage of the full vertical display resolution For 1-2 players simultaneous Progressive scan support Requires 12 memory blocks for savesGameplayTo really appreciate Ikaruga, one must understand how the game works. There are no pick-ups, no power-ups, and not a single fairy in the whole game. Instead Ikaruga uses a single fire button and a Homing Laser button. There are two types of enemies and enemy fire: dark and light -- no more, no less. A third button switches the ship from dark to light. When the ship is ~dark,~ it can absorb dark projectiles but is susceptible to light projectiles, and vise versa. This is the gameplay mechanic that's borrowed from Silhouette Mirage.Homing Lasers are built up through a meter on the left side of the screen. These sometimes-massive laser blasts can be unleashed when the ship has absorbed enough enemy power. Not only is this useful in boss battles, but also very good when the screen is a bit too full of unfriendly aircraft.Switching is instantaneous and many times means the difference between survival and doom. Firing patterns in the game are made specifically to take advantage of this extremely unique aspect of gameplay. These varied firing patterns throughout the game not only reduce the monotony typically associated with games in this genre, but they increase the longevity of the game as well.To really make it through the game requires a different way of thinking. It's almost like mentally ~blocking out~ projectiles that correspond with the ship and avoiding the opposite color. The idea of switching is easy, but doing it on the fly is another matter and requires practice. There's a certain satisfaction in being able to simultaneously fire and switch back and forth while avoiding enemy ships and structures.Think this looks tough? Keep playing. A bit confusing at times, Ikaruga isn't the traditional shooter. It's not the type of game that can be played without devoting 100-percent of one's mental strength to deal with the trials within. Similar to rhythm-action games, it's definitely not the type of game that is played during a conversation.We're not going to spoil any surprises, but someone at Treasure must really be a true shooter fan, because there are a few tributes to older shooters that younger players might not realize. Some readers will instantly recognize what we're talking, about and it'll probably bring a smile to their faces.Non-shooter fans might find the likes of Ikaruga to be too difficult, as the second half of the game makes Raiden Jet DX look like a round of Atari 2600 Combat. For the dexterity-impaired, the initial gameplay curve might be a bit of shell shock bordering on teeth gnashing, saliva spitting, and four-word frustration. But within a few minutes, one's brain will start to figure the simple yet complex idea out. Add to that a great two-player co-op mode, and you've got another must-have classic from the famous development studio.  GraphicsFunctionally gorgeous -- that's one way to put the visuals in Ikaruga. Treasure faced an interesting predicament when it designed a shooter based on colors. Mass confusion and frustration would set in if the background, enemies, and particle systems were anything but two specific colors. So we won't see any uber-bright colors or backgrounds in this shooter. What we will see are a lot of hi-tech and industrial looking structures and backgrounds. In its defense, Ikaruga does feature some stage themes to break up the absence of any real color.We don't care if every ship is either black or white or that the passing scenery isn't as bright as Fran's glow-in-the-dark Underoos (the ones with the streak mark) because they look very cool. Enemy aircraft come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from gigantic bosses to tiny fighters. The player controlled ship also has a better, more space-age appearance than the Galaga-reject from Radiant Silvergun.SoundWe've never been too fond of Treasure sounds -- not so much as its sights. Ikaruga is a departure from the developer's normal cutesy crap. The music, sound effects, and voiceovers are perfect for the game. Background music is exactly is exactly that and we wouldn't have it any other way. Explosions, laser blasts, and turbine sounds are just right, too.Boss encounters are heralded with loud noises akin to an emergency broadcast -- not so original, but thumbs-up, nonetheless. A bit of chatter between the ships in some alien language would have been kind of cool, but probably not in tune with the game's style and theme.Call me an old-school gamer, a shooter freak, or what have you, but I will buy Ikaruga. It's just that good. Sure, it's a bit on the short side, but Ikaruga is a fantastic example of clever game design. Slap on some beautifully modeled visuals, a fitting soundtrack, and fantastic effects, and we have a winner.Without a doubt, this is a better game than Radiant Silvergun. For one, Ikaruga takes itself far more seriously with no ~The Price is Right~ music or campy anime characters spoiling the otherwise fast-paced action. I feel more like the Last Starfighter when I play Ikaruga. I do have to mention that Ikaruga is a shooter and it's a shooter-fan's shooter. If you don't like intense, mind-numbing shooting action, then you're going to hate Ikaruga. However, if you grew up on heavy doses of Ikari Warriors and Gradius, then you'll probably feel right at home with this one-of-a-kind blast-a-thon. Five more stages would have been nice, but that's nothing a sequel can't cure.", "date": "Apr 9, 2003"}
