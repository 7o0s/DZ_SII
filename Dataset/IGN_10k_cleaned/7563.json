IGN AU is reviewing Gears of War and we haven't finished it. In fact, we're only two-thirds of the way through the campaign. But the game is so damn good that both Patch and I are trying not to hammer our way through to the credits. We've still clocked up over 15 hours of game time each, because we're milking this baby for all it's worth. The campaign experience is one to be savoured, to be enjoyed for as long as possible, as there probably won't be anything like it again for quite some time. That in itself is one of the biggest quandaries with Gears of War - it's one of those titles that arrives every couple of years and raises the bar so high that it almost spoils every game released in the following six months. Don't get us wrong, we're not saying Gears is perfect. But its annoyances are so quickly overwhelmed by the sheer brilliance of everything that it does right, you'll soon forget all about them.   These minor grievances are most apparent the first time you play Gears. More specifically, the biggest issue is the control scheme. ~Context-sensitive~ is the new lens flare of controls; we've seen it in the streamlined movement of the latest Splinter Cell outing, and Gears follows this trend. The green A button on the 360 controller is the door to context-sensitive heaven. This single button allows you to run, to dodge, to jump over obstacles and even to move into a cover position. That's one busy little button.   Meet our friend Mr Locust. He'd like to wear your intestines like a neck tie.   Obviously, with so many actions attached to a single thumb press, there's the potential for things to go screwy. For the first few hours, we'd accidentally take cover when meaning to sprint, or jump when trying to take cover. Both of which equalled a quick and painful death. There's good reason for this button doing so much though; casual gamers find the many buttons on the 360 controller overwhelming. Yet to hardcore gamers, the 360 controller is simply an extension of their limbs. For these players it would have been nice to have an ~experienced~ control scheme, splitting up some of the actions across unused buttons.    Thankfully, within a few hours these problems become minimal. With experience our involuntary commando rolls happened less often, and we felt truly in control of our onscreen avatar. Still, it would have been nice to have a jump button. It's not much of an issue in the campaign mode, but in multiplayer it can be a bit of an artificial constraint, slowing the movement of your character.    Now that we've got one of the very few complaints out of the way, let's get to the good stuff. And there's plenty of it.   For such an ugly mofo, this guy looks gooood. And yes, that's in-game.  Nothing can prepare you for the visuals that Epic has squeezed out of the 360. Each of the 360's three CPU cores must be screaming in agony as they display the startling scenery that Epic beats out of them. The gap between the visuals in Gears and every other 360 title is as massive as the neck of the main character, Marcus. The fact that it does all this at a silky smooth frame rate is further proof of Epic's mastery of the 360 hardware.    Character models are so finely carved from the Unreal 3 Engine technology that you'll notice the minutest of details. Veins pop out of the steroid-enhanced soldier's physiques, and we're sure the scar on Marcus' face is there simply because the engine allows it. The armour worn by warriors is comprised of an intricate patchwork of three dimensional plating. Characters are animated with a cohesive grace rarely seen in a video game; there's none of the awkward gaps between two different animations that we've had to put up with until now.    While the levels aren't quite Battlefield 2-big, they're not far off. Unlike Battlefield's sparse deserts, this wide open, apocalyptic Earth is chock full of scenic delights, with dilapidated buildings, burnt-out cars and bloody corpses sprawling as far as the eye can see. Even in the claustrophobic underground areas the developers let the engine show its strengths, with levels opening into vast towering caverns. The engine is just as capable of rendering enclosed areas, decorated with so many intricate features that it would make the Doom III engine blush. Large areas, small areas; this engine handles them both with a panache that would make John Carmack proud.   Water effects have been given special attention, with one of the five acts of the game set in the middle of a raging downpour. Water runs and glistens off every surface, moving fluidly just as it should. Another level takes place entirely in the dark, highlighting the game's realistic lighting effects. Walking into the darkness in this level means instant death, forcing the player to focus keenly on the dynamic light-sources. A few critics have complained about the game's drab colour scheme; if they were expecting a technicoloured rainbow in this game's apocalyptic setting, perhaps they'd be better off playing Viva Piata.    There's a reason the characters in Gears are so over-the-top macho. You have to believe they could beat these guys.  Cameras can be difficult beasts to tame in the third person shooter genre. Nots so in Gears; it's arguably the most well-disciplined purveyor of onscreen action the genre has seen. Not once did it misbehave and look at a brick wall when it should have been pointing at an incoming Locust. And when crouched against a low wall of rubble, with rounds zipping over our heads like so many angry wasps, our beloved camera allowed us to see when the inevitable Locust chainsaw charge was commencing.   Maybe it's because the visuals are so spectacular, but the sound stage in Gears doesn't quite equal the visual feast. Gunfire isn't oomphy enough for our liking, although the guttural war cries of the Locust are spine-chilling. It appears the sound engine could even be a little buggy; during several cut-scenes, certain obvious sounds such as gunfire or explosions lacked any sound at all. Strange, but hopefully fixable. The music does the job nicely though, with its militaristic, mooding tones shifting tempo seamlessly to better fit the on-screen action.   So then, Gears is without a doubt the finest looking game on the 360. It could even be the finest looking game yet, regardless of platform. But games aren't all about the graphics   This is where the gut-wrenching, cranium-exploding gameplay comes into its own. Gears is a pure-blooded shooter, so if you don't like these games, there's a good chance you won't like Gears. Hell, if you don't like shooters you're probably not even reading this review, so we can tease you about being the boring MMORPG nerd that you are, and tell you to go save some wood elves or some such. However, if you do like shooters, get ready for a serving of some of the most satisfying, bullet-riddled, epic gunplay you've ever had the joy of working your trigger finger out to.   Earth isn't the happy place that it used to be.  The game's famous ~stop and pop~ mechanics have already been discussed to death in the three hundred IGN previews which ran in the lead up to the game. In case you've been living with Osama, ~stop and pop~ refers to the way you'll spend most of your firefights crouched behind the nearest piece of available cover, occasionally popping up to take a shot. So how does this simple gameplay mechanic affect the feel of the game? Well, think back to any decent war movie you've seen. Some of the tensest moments in these films show the hero cowering in fear as bullets smack into the wall they're hiding behind. It's the feeling that death is a few centimetres of concrete away. That's how you'll spend a large chunk of your time in the Gears universe; cowering behind a wall, vision constricted, trying not to get your head blown off by a rapidly incoming wall of lead.    And then you hear the enemy scream as they begin their charge.   It's right about now that the first warm trickle of urine snakes down your leg. Do you pop up to take them out, risking a pounding from the mounted cannons or snipers? Or do you fall back to another piece of cover, not knowing from which side the charging Locusts are going to hit you?     While this type of action is one of the key components of the game, Gears is no one-trick pony. Variety is the spice of shooter life, and Gears doesn't disappoint. While the majority of the action is comprised of teeth-clenching, open-aired gunfights, it changes things up with spooky F.E.A.R.-esque corridor moments just when it needs to. Some of the coolest moments occur when characters aren't doing any shooting, instead simply strolling through the detailed environments on developer-directed scenic tours. During these semi-scripted moments, the yellow button swivels the camera to look directly at the closest cool thing designed into the level. There's even a driving section, with a gargantuan beast of a car that makes HALO's Warthog look like a VW Beetle.    During most battles you'll be accompanied by three other Gears troopers, and they do their job ably. Very rarely did we find that they'd screw up badly, and they saved our ass on many an occasion. Basic squad controls are introduced later in the game, but the AI is solid enough that we rarely needed to tell them what to do.   This solid AI extends to your enemy; the upper ranks of the enemy Locust are a frighteningly intelligent bunch. Shooter noobs should probably try to take them on the casual difficulty level, but for the rest of us, Hardcore is where it's at. And hardcore it is - if you keep charging the enemy guys instead of using cover like you're meant to, they will own every piece of your soon to be dismembered body. When you catch on and start to use cover correctly, they'll get tricky on you, flanking to your sides. Unfortunately the AI always spawns in the same place every time you play the game; it would have been nice to have random respawn locations to increase the replayability.    A band of brothers. Big-assed, steroid-enhanced brothers.  We keep hearing that this game has no innovation, is nothing new, that it's yet another mindless shooter but with a prettier face. Obviously those who are spinning these lines haven't even tried the game's finest feature. This feature has made us scream and yell our asses off in a way that no other game ever has. This feature defines the sheer ~F*ck yeah~ factor of Gears, and is what makes Gears not just a great game, but a Classic with a capital C.   This feature is the online co-operative campaign.    While playing through the campaign is a total blast, multiply the fun factor by precisely seventeen billion when playing with a pal. Don't fear that you'll miss any of the cut scenes or cheesy, macho dialogue by playing it in co-op, as everything you get in the singleplayer is delivered just the same in co-op. Setting up a co-op game is incredibly simple; you can even invite a pal to drop in anytime you're playing the campaign.    Bennett on the left, Patch on the right. Cue Patch storming into the Locust nest whilst screaming.  Due to the ~stop and pop~ mechanics, and the way enemy AI ducks when being shot at, co-op is a perfect fit for Gears. One player lays down the cover fire while the other flanks to a better vantage point. When playing with IGN AU's esteemed Associate Editor, Patch Kolan, our experience was slighty different. It generally played out with me cleverly using cover, while Patch would recklessly storm forward, get shot in the guts and collapse in a pool of blood. I'd then spend several minutes clearing off the bad guys so that I could revive Patch. Who would then recklessly storm forward, get shot in the guts and collapse in a pool of blood. All the while, we'd be laughing, screaming, yelling and basically annoying anybody within earshot of our apartments. At two in the morning.     Co-op runs absolutely perfectly, with no lag or stuttering whatsoever, and certain levels have obviously been designed with co-op specifically in mind. In a favourite of ours, one player mans a spotlight while the other has to stay within it and make their way down a street. It's a short section, but it's one of those gaming moments that will stay with us forever.    In short, co-op lifts this already brilliant game into the realm of mega-hit.     If there's one other hitch, it's that even when playing with a pal the campaign isn't exactly lengthy. According to our IGN US brethren, playing through on Hardcore should take about eight or so hours to complete, but thankfully it's so good you'll immediately try the campaign again on Insane level. Though we haven't yet hit this difficulty level, from all accounts Insane makes Halo's Legendary difficulty look like it was created for pre-schoolers. Once you've spent a good twenty hours or so beating the campaign on both difficulty levels, it's time to head to the multiplayer section.    Compared to the rest of the game, it'd be easy to write off the multiplayer as being overly simplistic. With only three minor variations on team deathmatch, it's lacking the wealth of game types we're now spoilt with by other Live titles. It only supports four on four as well, and there's not a buggy or jet ski in sight. Yet the simplicity of the game is a refreshing change from other recent shooters. The 10 maps are all gorgeous, and offer a nice mix of up-close-and-personal blast fests, along with long range camping delights. The covering system is fully implemented online, giving fire-fights a back and forth, slugfest-feel to them. Even just spectating a match is exciting, watching both teams ducking and bobbing behind cover as they advance upon each other. The inclusion of the chainsaw weapon, not to mention gib-tastic headshots, curb stomping and a variety of other gory deaths make each kill a bone-crunchingly visceral experience. The netcode is superb; we barely noticed any lag even when playing against US opponents. And praise the creator, there's even a working server browser - none of that crappy matchmaking rubbish that doesn't work in Australia, folks.   Again, this is in-game. We're not lying to you. Considering the immense hype behind Gears of War, there was a scary potential for it to not live up to expectations. We can happily report that not only has it met these expectations, it has surpassed them. We haven't had this much fun playing a shooter since well, we can't quite remember the last time a game was this good. At least not in the scream-into-your-headset, blast-that-bad-dude-in-the-face kind of way that Gears delivers. It's a masterpiece that redefines what 360 gamers, and gamers in general, expect from the next-generation.", "date": "Nov 13, 2006"}
