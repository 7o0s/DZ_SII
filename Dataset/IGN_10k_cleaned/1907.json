{"name": "Illbleed", "name_review": "Illbleed", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/18/illbleed", "text": "The horror/action genre, born from the Alone In The Dark games and receiving much more fanfare thanks to the Resident Evil series, hasn't really changed much in the past few years.  The format for this genre is a mixture of third person action and the standard ~scavenger hunt~ of puzzle items and while blowing zombies up with a grenade launcher certainly has appeal, not many video game companies have tried something different with the whole ~survival horror~ genre.  This leads up to Illbleed, formerly a Jaleco acquisition and now a publishing product of startup AIA USA.  I applaud Climax Graphics, the same developers of Blue Stinger, for trying to spice up the somewhat stale horror/action genre with Illbleed's unique gameplay mechanics and campy dark humor.  Unfortunately, the game suffers from some major problems that will frustrate casual gamers and probably put most of the hardcore crowd asleep without fear. Illbleed's premise is simple  survive the deadly traps and monsters of the famous Illbleed Horror theme park built by the infamous movie horror producer Michael Reynolds.  Get through the park in one piece and you'll be awarded {with pinky finger to mouth} 100 million dollars!  Of course, with that much money on the line, don't expect this to be the typical house of horrors filled with spring-loaded objects.  Four brave teenagers decide to take the challenge and you start off playing Eriko Christy.  The park is separated into different themed aspects of horror movies produced from Michael Reynolds.  There's also an item shop, ~photo shop~ that saves your progress, a ~visitor center~ where you can change to different characters (you must locate them in the park before you can play them) and a hospital.  The hospital not only allows you to heal your character, but when you find upgraded ~human organs~ (brain, heart, etc), you can have the doctors perform surgery to customize your character with more health, greater adrenaline supply, and a slower heart rate.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking... why would you want to do that?  Well, that's part of the gameplay system of Illbleed where you not only have to monitor your health, but if you don't want to die of a heart attack, keep your pulse rate low and if you don't want to bleed to death, make sure to patch up those wounds with bandages.  Unlike most of the horror/action genre, you character isn't very well armed; in fact, you'll only have access to one weapon specific to each level.  And you'll have to find this weapon, so if you can't find it, you'll be relying on your fists when you encounter enemies.  However, since you're not a part of some elite group of soldiers, you don't have to fight most of the time.  When you engage enemies in ~combat mode~ you'll often see a green ~H~ on the floor.  If you stand by this ~H~ you can hail a helicopter that will slowly drop a ladder down.  It takes awhile for the chopper to drop the ladder, but once it does, you'll make a ~narrow escape~ and you won't have to face the monsters.  This ~narrow escape~ feature won't be available all the time, and obviously not when you're taking on end level bosses.  But for the most part, it's not monster encounters you should worry about since there are a lot of traps to avoid in this game.  Sure you'll encounter hideous fiends and other ugly horrors but most of the time, you'll be avoiding traps and finding clues.  During this exploration part of the game, a sensory-feedback meter displays eyesight, hearing, smell, and sixth sense.  Whenever you approach an area with a trap, frightening obstacle, or hidden item, one of the senses will display a ~blip~ indicating that you're close to something strange.  And once you find the Horror Monitor item you'll be able to target certain areas that you suspect have a surprise and mark it with a glowing icon.  However, every time your mark an area, you use up adrenaline so plot your markers carefully; not every suspected area will have a hidden item or a nasty trap.  The Horror Monitor is usually found at the beginning of each level and it's a necessary item that you have to grab before venturing further into the each stage.  The mix of action sequences with the unique sensory-feedback meter to detect hidden items and traps make a very unique gaming experience, one that should've made Illbleed a standout title... if it weren't for the awkward controls, jerky animations, and camera angle problems.  So, you've got a horror/action game with unique gameplay mechanics and lots and lots of blood... how can it go wrong?  Well, first off comes the control and at first, it doesn't seem to be a problem when your in exploration mode.  In fact, the game gives you a number of camera angles to choose during exploration mode, making it a whole lot easier to search around the stage.  However, once you get locked into combat, that's a whole different story.  When you fight another monster, the camera angle is locked and this can be very frustrating when you get close to the camera.  Then comes the controls during your battle with the horrors and that gets frustrating.  While there is a semi-auto lock when you attack enemies, movement can often get awkward with the analog controls.  Frequently, when you want to run away from a certain foe you'll just walk even if your pushing up all the way on the analog pad.  Jumping sequences don't occur too often but the jumping mechanics are pretty horrid; whenever you jump forward with your character, there's about a three second recovery time that's extremely annoying.  This becomes immediately apparent in the big jumping sequence against the first boss and you can personally ask my neighboring IGNPS editors how loud I swore due to the poor jumping mechanics.  Collision detection is pretty iffy and while I don't want to ruin it for anyone that decides to play this game, a certain dodge mechanic can make you impervious against many of the bosses.  And when I mean impervious, attacks that obviously hit my character don't register when I activate the dodge feature.  I can appreciate the effort that went into the unique gameplay mechanics of Illbleed, but the clumsy controls and frustrating camera angles, make this game pretty difficult to play.  One warning to players that decide to buy this game, it may take you a few tries before you finally grasp what to do in this gam; it doesn't help that you actually have to find certain items that are essential (i.e. Horror Monitor) before continuing on in the game.  And when you're constantly worrying about these problems, it's really hard to  have fun getting scared with Illbleed.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Apr 18, 2001"}
