The ordinary gamer's reaction to Tales of Destiny II is likely something like ~Oh, goody, a new 40-hour RPG!  What fun!~  In contrast, the online games reviewer's reaction to Tales of Destiny II is more along the lines of ~Oh, [expletive], a new 40-hour RPG.  Bollocks.  No sleep this weekend.~  It's like the Legend of Dragoon effect, except the game happens to be good in this instance.  Yes, Tales of Destiny II is quite a worthy piece of work, especially in this godless era of the Death of Sprites.  Namco may be best known for its big-ticket next-generation polygon-cranking monstrosities, but the Tales series is one of its most popular franchises in Japan, and for good reason -- it's carried by strong 2D graphics, engaging character designs, and a great action-oriented battle system that has no close equivalent in any other game (save perhaps Valkyrie Profile, and that's still not particularly accurate).  On the flip side, the story is a trifle dry (a failing shared by the previous Tales of Destiny).  The game's narrative doesn't pull it forward as powerfully as the experience of actually playing the game.  Those hooked on the Final Fantasy formula of ~STORY!...(combat)~ may find it a little tedious -- you have to fight an awful lot in this game, developing effective strategies while you do so, and you're liable to die with a reasonable frequency.  But the battles have some of the most pleasantly plumbable depths of any ever devised, and the same goes for that classic tri-Ace cooking system.  Gameplay  Tales' signature game system is Linear Motion Battle, devised way back in the day for the series' Super Famicom debut.  Combat takes place on a horizontal 2D plane, a little like a very crowded Street Fighter battlefield, and you attack and defend in real time, using button and direction combinations for regular attacks and Craymel Artes, a wonderfully silly way to say ~special attacks.~  It's possible to fight in a very limited manner by just pointing in your opponent's direction and hammering the basic attack button, but death will follow soon thereafter in any difficult fight.  A well-rounded strategy involves using different directional attacks, slashes and thrusts (which are more or less effective depending on your weapon type), and quick hit-and-run tactics, and naturally special maneuvers, which range from simple magical strikes to massive multi-hit combinations.  You have a four-character party for most confrontations, but control only one character at a time, leaving over the rest of the team to the AI's direction.  There are plenty of options for fine-tuning your party's responses, though, including about a dozen different general strategies and numerical sliders for tuning aggressiveness within those strategies.  For ordinary combat, you can pick a generic kill-'em-all battle plan, and then specialize according to the monster population of a certain area or the tendencies of a difficult boss.  This perhaps makes preparation and strategy sound like a more laborious affair than it actually is -- Tales does a very good job of combining the engaging twitch action of a fight with the strategy that surrounds it.  It's not simple, but it doesn't bog down in the details, either, and though the lion's share of gameplay is centered around combat, there's a little more action to occupy your attention outside the battlefield.  Craymel Artes develop automatically in the beginning, but once you gather Greater Craymels (trust me, it'll make sense of a sort), there's an interesting system whereby you mix them together to create new skills.  And of course, a trace perhaps left behind by the folks who originally made Tales and according to legend founded tri-Ace, there's the cooking system.  As you travel the world, you encounter the Wonder Chef, a mysterious figure who teaches you recipes.  Cook a dish out of the requisite ingredients (collected and purchased across the world) and you'll get a boost to your HP, a thorough detoxification, or several other beneficial effects.  More games should let you do this sort of thing, and Tales of Destiny II gets even more points for mixing it up with an Iron Chef-style minigame event.  Graphics  Wow, a 2D game.  A completely 2D game, in fact, save for the 3D world map sequences, which hardly count.  Tales of Destiny II is built out of nothing but flat 2D backgrounds and flat-as-a-pancake sprites, and it manages to pull it off quite well on the purportedly RAM-deficient PlayStation.  The battle sequences don't slow down, even when the field is packed full of as many as 10 or 12 combatants, and when the action gets hectic it doesn't go halfway.  Special attacks are accented by a dash of 3D special effects, and once you build up an impressive arsenal of Craymel Artes, you should have plenty of cool animations to choose from.  As far as design is concerned (in contrast to execution), I'm not sure I like the characters in the new game quite so much as Mutsumi Inomata's last set of designs for the first Tales of Destiny (the second game in the series proper, Destiny II/Eternia being the third).  Hero Reid Hershel is definitely an original piece of work, in comparison to Destiny's cookie-cutter hero, and Farah presents the interesting spectacle of a martial-arts expert in a long skirt, but Destiny's Rutee had far more edge, and there will perhaps never be any heroine to equal Philia Felice.  Mio Kisaragi with a gigantic sword.  And glasses.  Good God, the image haunts me still.  Sweeping the brain damage into a dusty corner and returning to more pertinent matters...Tales suffers on occasion from a certain lack of invention in world design -- it's frequently too easy to peg the basic types of areas.  Here's the forest area, there's the fiery volcano, that's the desert town over there, etc.  Once you get closer to the realm of Celestia later on, things perk up a fair bit, but it's nothing like the invention you see at the high points of the Final Fantasy games.  This is definitely a good-looking game in its particular niche, and made even more so by how empty that niche is nowadays, but it's not a visual ground-breaker.  Sound  Nor does it pack a soundtrack for the ages, unfortunately, which is one of the elements that can most effectively carry an RPG.  The battle theme is suitably adrenalized, and there's an appropriate selection of pieces to accompany a range of different dramatic or comedic cutscenes, but again, there are plenty of tracks that just don't stand up and get noticed.  Am I aging too quickly, or is RPG music perhaps in a bit of a decline, of late?  Final Fantasy IX lagged behind its predecessors, FFX is too weird to judge so far, Chrono Cross wasn't quite up there with Xenogears, and the list goes on.  But then Mitsuda's work on Xenosaga sounds breathtaking so far, so perhaps the laments are premature as yet.  Well, one can always complain about voices if one wants.  Localization  Namco has provided a first-rate text translation for this game, at least -- any problems the script and story has were already there.  The dialogue flows decently, the characters use recognizably human vocabulary and syntax, and each character's personality quirks come through effectively.  Keele, for example, is great fun when he launches into fits of erudite Craymelogical technobabble, while Ras has a nicely subtle air of penetrating wisdom, which isn't the easiest effect to create.  The game's remarkably handy options menu has selections for disabling the battle and/or story voice clips, so those who may find the voice acting bothersome should have no problems at all.  So how will you react to the voices?  Push.  I hate discussing this issue, because I have this nasty little side of me that I can never push down, the side that occasionally busts out with the death threats at American anime translation companies.  Even my more rational impulses still have a very, very soft spot for Minami Omi, the actress who plays Meredy in the Japanese version, and who is replaced by one of the American version's weakest performances.  But to try and put a more even spin on the subject, at the very least the battle voices are tolerable (the ones you actually have to listen to with considerable frequency), and the spoken dialogue sequences do certainly have high points.  Any problems come more from simply bland delivery than anything actively bad, and Farah and Reid both slip into their roles pretty well from the beginning.  This isn't going to change any serious fan's mind about English dubs, but it won't inspire too many complaints, either.  Compared to other games in its class, Tales of Destiny II is a competitor, if not necessarily the first choice.  I'd play Valkyrie Profile first, given its far more interesting narrative, Persona 2's atmosphere smokes almost any alternative, and they've all of them got pretty questionable English dubs.  The Tales battle system is in a class by itself, though, especially if you've never played any other game in the series.  Of course, if you can get the first Tales of Destiny, that might actually be the worthier purchase, particularly since you ought to be able to get it cheap these days.Any RPG fan should at least consider this game, though, especially if your tastes run towards a gameplay-driven experience.  Tales of Destiny II features complex combat and a lot of it, thanks to a hefty encounter rate, in a style unique to itself.  The rest of the game may not quite live up to the innovation shown in its battle system, but that's a fairly high mark to reach.", "date": "Sep 19, 2001"}
