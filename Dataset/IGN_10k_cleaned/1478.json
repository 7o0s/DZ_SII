I didn't think the movie was so hot and I didn't think the book was so hot. But I was particularly sorry to see that the two best elements of the book (namely the power suits and Heinlein's Nazi-like take on eugenics) were completely eliminated from the film. So I'm not a fan boy out to punish the game despite its worth for the sins of the book or the movie. Conversely, I don't feel any need to defend the faults of the game just because I dig the movie or book. It's called being objective, people, and it's what good reviewers do.  But they also talk about the game eventually, right? The PC version of Starship Troopers is a fully 3D, real-time, squad based strategy game. And there are power suits aplenty but still no overarching, totalitarian government telling people how to breed. Oh well.... While the game has some definite highpoints, it's not as sophisticated or, quite honestly, as interesting as I'd hoped. While the prospect of small squad strategy in a futuristic setting against an arachnid enemy sounds cool, there's just not enough variety in the game. I usually just clumped my troops in one big blob and marched them up to each of the enemy strong points. The game doesn't make it easy to do anything more complicated than that. About the most intricate tactical plan you can set up is some sort of bait and draw.  But on the plus side, the control scheme for the game is pretty convenient. You can click and drag to select units and then click on a spot on the map to issue a movement order. You can set engagement orders as well so your infantry will know whether or not to stop and fire on targets. There's also a system of hotkeys so you can get right to whatever essential function you need. Squad selection via hotkey is simple enough, and you can select any of your specialists (medics, psychics, engineers, etc) almost instantly.  My biggest problem was in selecting targets. By the fourth or fifth mission, I just gave up on targeting specific bugs. Instead I'd just inch the MI closer and closer to something I wanted to shoot. Once the target was in their range, they'd open up on their own. Otherwise, instead of targeting a bug for attack, I'd issue a move order to the far side of the bug and watch helplessly as my MI rushed past the bug firing their weapons. This is by far the worst handicap the game has going for it and it caused me no small amount of frustration.  Agh!  Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, let's continue. While the camera works really well overall, there are some basic problems with centering. You can rotate the camera around and zoom in and out, but the real issue comes when you want to get a look at all the troops in a particular location. The camera centers on all of your selected troops but may not present the best viewing angle. Once you rotate the angle around, you'll lose sight of some of your troops.   The game looks very good running in 800x600 mode. When you zoom in for extreme close-ups you're going to notice a lot of roughness in the models but from a distance, the game looks fantastic. There are lots of details to be seen on the troopers and some remarkable features on the landscape. From trucks to buildings to bug holes and bridges, the maps in Starship Troopers are well-designed and nice to look at. The bug models are also pretty sharp and really creepy. Which gives you more than enough reason to get a look at the neat weapons effects.  But the details in the visual half of the design aren't as sharp in the sound department. The sound is quite choppy on our systems here at the office and the balancing is way off. Effects and ambient sounds are turned up really high and the vocal directions you receive from your commander are universally drowned out. Even adjusting the balance didn't seem to rectify the problem.  And the trooper icons in the lower right of the screen are supposed to show you which troopers are selected. Except that the small outlines that highlight the selected troopers aren't that vibrant. As a result you can think you've got everyone selected when actually you're leaving troopers behind. I know this sounds like I must be stupid, but it happened to me more than once. I accidentally left my lieutenant in bug infested territory just because the camera wasn't exactly centered on the units.  I also left a soldier behind once because of the not so great pathing in the game. He was stuck behind a bug hole that we had destroyed. It took me a good three or four minutes to get him loose just so I could end the mission. By the time I did get him out, I was wondering why there wasn't a force fire feature in the game. But for the most part, the unit AI is good. Your troops will pull back from a bug assault thereby giving themselves a little more time to take the bug out before it can attack them. This one little feature makes the game playable. Without it, I doubt you could make it much past the first few missions without losing all of your troops.   And on the subject of losing troops, I found that mortality rates in the game were pretty high. But I kind of dig that, you know? That's one part of the flavor of the Starship Troopers story that's definitely intact. The high death rate is cool. At the very beginning of my game, I went through and renamed all of my troopers after people in the office. By the end of the fourth mission, only about 10% of these people were still alive. They had been replaced with other troops along the way, but I didn't bother renaming them. In Starship Troopers, it's wise not to get too attached to your troops. They'll die soon enough.   Sadly, the game only offers the one campaign. While it's a pretty nice range of mission types and worlds, they pretty much all boil down to the same thing -- keep your guys together, shoot bugs and get to the extraction point. There could've been a lot more to choose from among the various missions. I guess I understand that the point of the Mobile Infantry is to kill bugs dead, but even when you do pull an escort or rescue mission, it plays out exactly the same as the bug hunt missions. On a few levels you'll have command of a fortress complete with gun turrets and ramparts. You can position your soldiers at each of the gun emplacements and they'll fire on any target that comes into range. But since there's no instant action or multiplayer feature, the campaign is all you're going to get from this game.  There's been a lot of enthusiasm for the game. I mean, every day we get at least a few letters from readers asking where the review is. Unfortunately, this is it. I'd have loved to give the game a better score. Not on account of any love for the movie/book (see paragraph one) but on account of the ideas inherent in the concept. The designers obviously went for more of a small scale approach with this title and it just doesn't convey the same sense of scale that you'd expect from a Starship Troopers game. But even taking the reduced scale of the game as given, there's not enough excitement here to keep you interested.  -- Stephen Butts     Want to share your opinions with the world? Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Regardless of what actually went on during the course of development, whatever innovations they achieved are overshadowed by annoying combat mechanics and shallow gameplay loops. Some of the environments are pretty cool, and some of them are quite large. Some of the humor is effective. But these parts aren't enough to stitch together the whole, and there isn't any particular reason I'd recommend Starship Troopers, as much as I liked the film.", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
