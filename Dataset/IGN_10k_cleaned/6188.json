She's got guns, she's got an English accent, ahe's got ... well, we all know what she's got.  In the recently released Tomb Raider III, the now famous archaeologist returns to dish up more looting and shooting, but does it really improve upon the venerable Tomb Raider series?  Read on to find out...    The intricate storyline in TRIII revolves around a crystalline meteorite, Charles Darwin, and an ancient culture that lived on the continent of Antarctica.  I don't want to give too much of the plot away, but I can tell you that Lara's ultimate goal is to retrieve four ancient artifacts fashioned from the earth-bound fireball.  Tomb Raider III is set in a variety of exotic locations around the world, including India, the South Pacific, and Antarctica.   TRIII offers up 19 huge levels which, although not as large as those found in TRII, show real thought and insight from the designers.  Though basically linear (meaning that you'll be led to the end and can't return to previous levels), many of the levels include multiple paths that lead you to the same location.  This multipath design offers extended gameplay and, even though you don't have to explore every nook and crevice in each level, you might want to check out where each path goes since you'll find different weapons and power-ups depending on which way you travel.   You begin your adventures in the dense Indian jungle fighting tigers, monkeys, and poisonous cobras.  The story really unfolds at the end of the India setting when you meet an archaeologist who's also searching for the ancient meteorite-fashioned artifacts.  He will give you a hot tip as to the whereabouts of the relics.  You can then choose in which order you want to progress through the game, travelling to either the city of London, the desert of Nevada (where you'll have a chance to explore the mysterious Area 51), or to an island in the South Pacific.  All of this sets you up for the grand finale of TRIII, which takes place in Antarctica.  TRIII owes much more to the first Tomb Raider than the 2nd installment (thank God, right?), and TRIII really feels more like a sequel than TRII did.  So what does TRIII offer that the others haven't?  Well, to be perfectly honest, not a whole heck of a lot.  Lara does sport a few new moves such as the ability to mokey-swing and crawl under low-lying ledges.  She can also sprint for short periods of time which comes in very handy for avoiding the countless number of boulders that seem to roll her way, spelling instant death for our heroine.  She has a bevy of new vehicles to explore on.  There's a quad, a kayak, and mini-sub, all allowing Lara to explore areas where she wouldn't be able to travel on foot.  She even shows off some new outfits in TRIII.  Lara begins with her classic threads in India, but dons a black leather catsuit in London, blue desert camo pants and a tank top in Nevada, and a rather skimpy looking jacket and orange camo pants in Antarctica ... it is rather cold there, you know. The designers at Core did bring back many of the dinosaurs from the original, including velociraptors and the dreaded T-Rex, but even with the new graphical touches, TRIII still plays the same as the other games in the Tomb Raider series, so the experience hasn't really changed at all.   TRIII uses the same engine as the other TR installments, but Core has added quite a few new graphical enhancements to the environments.  The new graphics engine allows the introduction of triangular shapes and curves into the game, thereby adding to the detail of the landscapes.  However, the natural settings still look way too polygonal to give a realistic feel.  The new engine also allows for enhanced shadows, transparencies, smoke effects, and reflections. One of the neatest new graphical improvements is the addition of multi-colored lighting effects. Lara's flares glow brilliantly and flourescent lights flicker and cast long shadows.  Although the graphics in TRIII are somewhat outdated by other games currently out, the lighting effects do look really good and Lara's flare is much more useful in TRIII than in any Tomb Raider game to date.  One of my biggest complaints with TRIII is a problem I've had with the entire series: it is rather difficult to control.  The quirky button combinations required to pass the deadly puzzles and jumping traps simply don't cut it.  It's incredibly frustrating to perform the same task over and over again only to get impaled by spikes or crushed by a boulder because Lara didn't jump when you hit the button.  Arrrrrgghhhhhh!!!!  When it really comes down to it, TRIII is more of the same, only done better.  They game is huge and it will take a long time to finish, but it's also horribly frustrating in parts and you may end up tossing it aside to play some other more rewarding game.  In the end, TRIII is fun, but offers nothing new to an already played-out series.  If you're a fan, you'll love TRIII, but if you're a casual gamer you might want to look at some of the other titles available for the holiday season.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Dec 11, 1998"}
