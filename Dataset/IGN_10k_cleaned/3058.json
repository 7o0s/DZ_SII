Several years later, Ubi Soft reinvents the franchise as a 3D platformer, holding its own against even the best Nintendo games.  Now, in 2002, Ubi Soft tries yet again to reinvent and keep Rayman fresh in our minds with Rayman Arena.  Does Rayman Arena live up to its predecessor's legacy?  To put it lightly, Hell No.     Gameplay  Rayman Arena consists of two main types of games: racing and battle.  The racing mode is broken down into Obstacle Race and Time Attack.  Obstacle race is exactly what it sounds like.  Up to four people can race towards the finish line while avoiding obstacles set up to slow you down.  Time Attack mode takes place in the same levels, but rather than race towards a goal, all players must cross a checkpoint within six seconds of the leader or else they are eliminated.  The last one to remain wins.  What makes this a little more interesting is the ability to shoot your opponent to freeze them briefly.  It's too bad the time you are frozen is so short it barely even helps you.  By the time you run past an opponent, they are unfrozen and freeze you.  Then when you unfreeze, you shoot them as they pass.  This can go on for the entire race if need be, especially since ammo is unlimited.      These racing games are similar to Mad Dash Racing due to the racing and platforming mix.  What brings this mode down is the sense of speed.  It is SLOW.  Also, the level design can at times be flat-out horrible.  A true shame.     The battle mode is also divided into two different games: Freeze Fight and Total Fight.  During Freeze Fight, lums will randomly appear on the map, and your job is to collect as many as you can within a 3 minute time limit.  To hinder you, your opponents have the ability to shoot ice bullets that will temporarily freeze you, just like in Time Attack Race mode.  Total Fight has you attacking your opponents in order to score the most points within a time limit.  Placed around the arena are generators that will give you a random weapon of some sort, ranging from shields to rockets.     The single player experience is pretty shallow.  You work your way through a Beginner League, and a Pro League, going against computer controlled opponents.  Winning these matches will eventually unlock four hidden characters, new maps, and also new player skins.  Also, in the racing mode you can unlock variations of Time Attack mode, like Speed Stress, Extreme Slide, and Future.  There is also another special race called Run, Run which has you outrunning a wave that kills at the slightest touch.     Playing through single player is not very exciting.  There is never really a sense of competition, and everything just feels, for lack of a better word, blah.  The game modes would make decent mini-games within a real Rayman game, but even then barely.  There's nothing really to make you want to come back and play again.  Maybe it's the fact that there seems to be no skill involved in any of the games.  Or maybe it's the slow pace of the games, when in fact they should be frantic and intense.  Or maybe it's the fault of the poor game design and need to cash in by making a party game with an otherwise excellent franchise like we've seen many times in past.  Oh well...      Unfortunately, multiplayer mode suffers the same fate.  Take everything that is wrong with the single player game and multiply it by 4.  Now everyone gets to run around mindlessly racing/killing each other.  Multiplayer may actually be worse due to the decreased screen size, and the fact that at least the computer opponents are supposed to know what's going on.  The perfect way to end a party.      Graphics  If there's one thing the Rayman games have been known for, it's their graphics.  Best described as playable cartoons, Rayman Arean continues the tradition with incredibly bright and colorful graphics.  While not quite as polished as say Rayman 2, Rayman Arena is easy on the eyes.  That's not to say it's not without its problems.   What's most bothersome graphically about this game is that, quality-wise, this is almost identical to what we saw on the Dreamcast with Rayman 2.  As much as I've always enjoyed the visual style of the games, it would've been nice to see a boost in quality considering we've been looking at this same level of detail, albeit good, for several years now.     Other than the above complaint, things look like they should.  The game moves at a great framerate that rarely slows down, the high-res textures look great as usual, and there are even a few effects, like rain drops sticking to the camera, thrown in.  The character models still have a few edges, but it's not something you really think about when playing.      Sound  If you like cheesy party game music, than you'll love the music in Rayman Arena.  Sounding more like filler music rather than anything else, be prepared to turn the music level to 0.  Jolly, ~fun~ music runs rampant throughout the game, and tends to be more annoying than anything else, though some, namely the deaf, may enjoy it.   Each character has their own theme music that you can hear during the race mode.  Whoever is in first place will have their music played for everyone to hear.  The instruction booklet says you can use this to find out if someone has passed you up, but I just looked in the right-hand corner of the screen and looked at what place I was in.  A nice feature only when wanting to annoy your losing friends with your theme music, as long as you can bear it.    Milking it.  Thats what Ubi Soft is doing to the Rayman name.  So many successful games spawn offshoots that are, in most cases, horrid.  There are always the rare exceptions (i.e. Crash Team Racing), but for every one good game, there are countless drink coaster games, Rayman Arena included.  This game is the antithesis of fun.  The only ones who might enjoy this game are people who enjoy pain, though I worry even for them.  A shallow and unbalanced game at best.  Let's hope Ubi Soft redeems itself with the upcoming Hoodlum Havoc.  Play at own risk.", "date": "Oct 14, 2002"}
