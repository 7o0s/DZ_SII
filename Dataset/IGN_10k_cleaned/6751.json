The series has become so established in fact, that the Harmonix-developed franchise has attracted a partner with a big-name franchise of its own. With four Karaoke Revolution games already out it's almost worthless to even talk about the game itself and simply ask whether or not the song list appeals to you and if you've ever found yourself singing in the shower. If the answer is yes to both, then this is a worthwhile purchase, plain and simple.   If you've played any of the previous Karaoke Revolution games, especially Karaoke Revolution Party, then you'll know exactly what to expect here. Only the new ability to put your own face into the game with the help of an EyeToy should stand out if you really want the character to be personalized. It's really the 35 accurate cover versions of ~The Gambler,~ ~Stand By Your Man,~ ~Redneck Woman,~ ~Save A Horse (Ride A Cowboy),~ ~When The Sun Goes Down,~ ~Good Ol' Boys,~ etc. that are the core appeal here. The songs are done well and the characters and environments have been countrified for the new audience.    If you've never ever heard of this Karaoke Revolution stuff, you're in for a treat. Instead of the classic bar system of lines of text becoming highlighted on a screen in front of actors frolicking in flowers or feeding each other chocolates, the Karaoke Revolution system is dead set on improving your singing skills by rating your ability. The lyrics scroll right to left on the screen, accompanied by lines that indicate the length and pitch of each word in the song. When you sing into the included microphone the game measures your pitch (you can be an octave off if you want to) and the more your pitch is at the right spot at the right time the better your score will be.   This may sound complicated, but before the first song is through it will make complete sense. With an arrow that indicates your current pitch, there's immediate feedback onto how well you're doing and it's easy to go just a little higher or lower if you're almost there. Different difficulty levels become pickier about just how far off the exact pitch you can be to earn points and there's certainly no shame in picking the easy difficulty level because this is all about having fun. Go ahead and practice on your own, but to really see the game take off you should invite a few friends over. Sure, you could practice on your own and be a living room star, but the true fun is in inviting other folks over to take a try at belting out the hits.   All of the previous multiplayer modes are here, but they're almost irrelevant. Playing the previous games for many dozens of hours has shown us that it's best to just let people play one by one, choosing a new song or trying to get a new high score -- well, that and playing through the Duet Mode where two people can sing at once. The expense of a second microphone will seem extravagant about as long as it takes to get a group of friends together to play it the first time. It lets more people play at once in addition to providing a partner for the shy ones who are playing for the first time.It's Karaoke Revolution with country songs. Any other questions? With four previous games under their belt, Harmonix has this down pat and this is a more targeted batch of songs for a specific audience. The formula is grooving along and this revolution has already become a movement. The only thing now is to hope for some other specialized versions that have the same song count as Karaoke Revolution Party. We'd love to see one that is dedicated to classic duets or maybe one that's timelier with just the latest songs. Now That's What I Call Karaoke? We'll see.", "date": "Mar 22, 2006"}
