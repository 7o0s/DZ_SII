Though the game had to be scaled back for the system to handle, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 on the Game Boy Advance is a true testament to the capabilities of the hardware, mirroring the outstanding gameplay of the original console design.  Of all the titles that were produced for the Game Boy Advance's US launch, this game is the top of the heap...and it will most likely remain there for the rest of the year. Good? Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is GRRRRRREAT! Features 13 pro skaters Six readily-available skateparks Career mode, Free Skate, Single Session modes Battery back-up Only for Game Boy Advance  If you haven't wrapped your hands around the PlayStation, Dreamcast or PC versions of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, you're honestly missing out on one of the most original and addicting games of this generation. You honestly don't have to be a skate freak to appreciate just how fun the game can be -- it's a real rush being able to take to the skies with flips and spins, landing the plank of wood on its wheels towards the next ramp to leap or rail to grind. And with all those combos to discover and items to collect, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a game with incredible variety.  On the Game Boy Advance, sacrifices had to be made. As much as Nintendo would love to tout the capabilities of the new system over the 12 year old Game Boy Color technology, the system just can't perform some of the same 3D capabilities of the big boys. This is a consumer level handheld game priced to sell, and PlayStation/Nintendo 64/Saturn-style 3D just wasn't cost effective at the time the system was designed.   But with that said, the development team at Vicarious Visions worked whatever magic they had to on the system, and they pulled off an amazing feat -- a 2D version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 that looks and plays nearly identical to the console brothers. The developers pulled off a polygonal engine for the skaters in order to preserve all the thousands of frames of animation at every conceivable angle, all while prerendering the skate park at a high color depth. The result is a game that looks and plays better than you could ever expect it to.  In the conversion, there are six skate parks to shred through, each one with its own quota to meet in order to complete the round. Tasks range from grabbing money, knocking over trashcans, grinding specific posts, destroying wall-mounted objects...as well as scoring as many points through tricks and combos as possible. At your command, you can jump, kickflip, spin, grind, grab...if it's a conceivable skateboard trick, it can be done in the game. You'll just have to master the controls in order to pull them off.  And the overall experience is just as thrilling on the handheld as it is on the console -- five parks from the PSX/Dreamcast/PC versions have been accurately represented in prerendered form on the Game Boy Advance version...with alterations because of the fixed perspective. Rail, half-pipe, quarter-pipe, and object locations are positioned in nearly the same spot as the console editions, which adds to the all-important, ~Dude, I totally recognize this!~ factor on the GBA.  Hidden rooms are also placed in the game (like the pool in the School Gym and the Wind Tunnel at the Hangar), though they're segmented separately from the rest of the park. The sixth track is a real treat for fans of the series -- one of the coolest Tony Hawk levels from the first console game makes a return in Tony Hawk 2 GBA: The Warehouse. The only real difference in level design -- the Game Boy Advance version doesn't have moving obstacles, like the taxis in New York, or the crazy Golf Cart security guard at the School Yard. The developers even got the presentation down to a T, with exploding text after successful or failed combo, and a zooming camera during a truly amazing stunt.  Since the console version used as many buttons as the system had available, the Game Boy Advance developers had to work the control configuration onto the system's two action buttons and two shoulder buttons. And it's here that the learning curve begins -- the shoulder buttons are already difficult to access, and to have them mapped for frequently used commands is a bit tough on the fingers. If you haven't already trained yourself to tap the L and R buttons along with a different direction on the control pad, you'll probably realize it's like patting your head and rubbing your belly. It takes practice...and Tony Hawk on the GBA will indeed train your fingers for whatever lies ahead in complex control schemes.  And as much as I can gush at just how great the game is, there are issues. First of all, the already sloped learning curve grows even steeper due to the fixed perspective. The game flows in multi-tiered levels, and since the camera never budges from its locked-in angle, and since the backgrounds are one huge image scrolling around to follow the character, it's difficult to judge angles between grindable object and ramps, as well as where exactly a floating object. But the longer you play, the more the eyes grow accustomed to the M.C. Escher-esque angles. So while the initial play may be a little on the confusing side, a few times around the park is all that's needed to orient the gamer.  Another sacrifice that had to be made was in the audio department. Oh, the sound effects from the console game are completely intact and amazingly accurate, but the score had to be changed. Tony Hawk has always been known for its use of licensed music, but on the GBA it just couldn't happen. So the development team recruited the help of Iridion developer Shin'en to provide a lively library of original background tunes -- and while they're not the real deal, the background music is absolutely top-notch.   The game is absolutely outstanding as-is, but there's room for more -- the Game Boy Advance version omits a Tony Hawk staple: multiplayer. This is strictly a solitaire, portable experience, which is a shame since these modes are totally addictive and intense on the console. The GBA version also doesn't have a create-a-player option, so Tony Hawk-philes will have to go through the game as one of the existing professional skaters in the line-up. And, of course, the GBA just didn't have the horsepower to offer the familiar create-a-skatepark option of the consoles. But we can let this one slide.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a fantastic game, and the Game Boy Advance version is no exception. It's  one of those games where you can pop in, play a round for a few minutes before putting it away...which makes it perfect on the handheld. The Game Boy Advance version is also a technical marvel, providing the first true polygonal game on the system -- and it's only the system's first year out of the gate! It's not a super friendly game, as you'll have to train both your eyes as well as your hands to experience the goodness that is Tony Hawk. I honestly can't wait to see what the team pulls off for the follow-up months from now.", "date": "Jun 14, 2001"}
