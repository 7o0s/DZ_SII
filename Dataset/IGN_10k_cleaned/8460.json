After all, Wario games in the past have generally been pretty excellent - from Wario Land on Game Boy through to WarioWare, so despite sharing a subhead with a truly awful Dana Carvey film and despite not being developed in-house by Nintendo, we were willing to give this gaming lucky dip a try. On the one hand, we could wind up with the gaming equivalent of blazing gold grills, tastefully studded with diamonds. On the other, our reward could be little more than a fart in a jar. You just never know.   Unfortunately, if you've already taken a cheeky look at the score, you'll know that Wario: Master of Disguise falls into the latter category. No gangsta pimp mouth for us. It really is a fart in a jar. Or more accurately, a rapid-fire set of fart jokes in a cartridge. Yes, from the moment Wario decides on his nom de plume for the game, becoming the ~silent but deadly~ master thief The Purple Wind, it's one fart joke after another. His rival, the Silver Zephyr even gets into the act, telling Wario that his new name ~reeks of inelegance~. Ho hardy ho. Of course, that's part of Wario's character, so we're not particularly surprised, and to be honest, the last paragraph really is little more than a stalling tactic to avoid talking about the game proper. Better get on with it, I suppose.   So, what's going on in this latest Wario game? Well, the moustachioed anti-hero has built himself - MacGuyver style - a device to jump into his TV. What does he do with it? Sink the ship at the start of Titanic so we don't have to sit through the whole damn movie? Hop onto Battlestar Galactica and tell Odama exactly who is a Cylon? Bounce into Baywatch to lie on the beach and watch the girls run? Nope, he goes into a TV series about the aforementioned Silver Zephyr, steals his magic wand ~Goodstyle~ (a.k.a. the Pringles mascot) and becomes a master thief. Or tries to, at least.   Quad screen Wario. Could this be a glimpse of the Nintendo QS? Probably not.  In his quest to get the maximum loot possible in each episode, Wario can use Goodstyle to change disguises. By the end of the first couple of levels you'll have three, and they're all triggered by drawing different shapes over Wario. Tick him, for instance, to become Thief Wario, who runs and jumps as normal but can also shoulder charge; draw a bubble around Wario's head to become Cosmic Wario, who can fire his laser to kill enemies and trigger switches; and draw a box to become Arty Wario, who can conjure crates and doorways back to your last save point out of thin air. Yes, you read that right - you can conjure crates (well, more like stone blocks really, but we'll take what we can get) out of thin air! If that's not a step forward for gaming I don't know what is. You have the most basic building block - the genetic code, if you will, of every game in the palm of your hand!   As the game progresses Wario gets access to eight disguises all up, from Genius Wario, who can see hidden doors and platforms, through to Wicked Wario who, well, the outfit's a little creep to be honest, but he can fly. Each disguise is triggered by drawing on-screen, and most of the special moves are also triggered by using the touch screen; tap where you want to shoot as Cosmic Wario or slide it across the screen to paddle across water as Captain Wario.   The ingredients are certainly there for an engaging platform/puzzle experience, where you can use your various disguises to beat each room, but the execution is clumsy to say the least. Not only do you often have to swap disguises several times in each room to get things done, but a simple misstep will see you doing it all over again, and the frustration really starts to mount when the game fails to recognise the shape you're drawing over Wario, switching you repeatedly to the wrong disguise. This is particularly vexing if you're in the middle of a boss battle ~yeah, just give me a sec. Sorry, put the wrong outfit on didn't I? Silly me!~   A couple of the guises Wario switches to during the game. Fear his wrath!  I'm also pretty glad I'm right-handed, because while using the D-pad for movement, jumping and crouching isn't a great solution to having a stylus in my right hand, it's a whole lot better than being left-handed and using the face buttons to move and jump around the world.   And how many games are there where you can honestly say you dread opening a treasure chest? Well, this is one of them. Getting a new disguise or piece of loot out of the many treasure chests in the world involves one of several brain-numbing mini-games. Ooh, I get to colour in a picture using the stylus! Don't stray outside the lines Jimmy! Wow! Prepare for the white-knuckle thrill-ride that is tracing objects - now in game form! Sarcasm aside, the mini-games are incredibly dull. This, coming from the figurehead of WarioWare - the ultimate collection of micro-games! Shocking.   In other areas Wario: Master of Disguise ranges from competent to sub-par. The level and puzzle design, for instance, is solid enough, featuring Metroid-style sets of interconnecting rooms, but the art design lacks the charm you'd expect from a Nintendo franchise, with bland surroundings and enemies that might as well be placeholder pixel blobs for all the personality they exude. This isn't an awful game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's clunky and mechanical, and there are far better platformers available for DS.  Wario: Master of Disguise is the perfect example of why its risky for Nintendo to outsource its franchises to other studios. Master of Disguise has all the right ingredients for a memorable platform/puzzle romp, but fails in the execution.", "date": "May 10, 2007"}
