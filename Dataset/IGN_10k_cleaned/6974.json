They just pulled this one with Xbox 360, and now EA Mobile is trying it with cell phones -- lemme tell you right up front: Don't give in to temptation. At E3 last month in Los Angeles, EA Mobile was showing off the smooth, slick FIFA 07. It's the one to hold out for.   FIFA World Cup Germany 2006 is based on old tech, but with a new tournament structure to reflect the World Cup championship currently underway. The World Cup mode lets you pick your favorite team from all 32 competing clubs and guide them to the finals. I choose the word ~guide~ carefully, because that's pretty much what you feel like when playing this too-easy game. Maybe the AI has been set to remedial to give players the joy of seeing their chosen team win it all, but that doesn't make for a compelling video game. AI players rarely make serious moves for the ball. They seem as half-hearted on the field as I felt playing the game.   World Cup Germany 2006 comes with an instant play mode just to get right into a match for those with constricted schedules. If you want to create a dream match-up, use the ~friendly~ mode to choose a couple of clubs and get into a skirmish. Shoot out mode lets you just practice taking penalty shots for a breezy arcade experience.   Helping bring down FIFA World Cup is the lackluster control. The game goes for realism by stuffing all 22 players on the field, but selecting players to pass to isn't easy -- especially if you are trying to move around with the thumbpad. You are far better off using the number keys, but even then, controls feel a little off.  It's hard to be excited about this game when you know what's on the horizon. World Cup Germany 2006 is a stop-gap product designed to reel in World Cup fans based on the hype of the world's biggest sporting event. And that's not necessarily a bad idea -- having the entire tournament set up from the get-go -- but the execution isn't worth your download dollars. I think they'll be far better served by just watching the action on television and waiting for the next proper FIFA game coming out this fall from EA Mobile.", "date": "Jun 9, 2006"}
