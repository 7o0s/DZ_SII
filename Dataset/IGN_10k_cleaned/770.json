The lack of US popularity probably has a lot to do with its limitations as a spectator and television event when compared with the many forms of oval racing that make up the bulk of American 4-wheel racing. Even so, there is no denying that professional rallying is one of the most demanding motorsports and has inspired some memorable computer and video games. Fortunately Mobil 1 Rally Championship (RC) continues this tradition and may just make a few more rally fans out of those who play it.  To the uninitiated it may be necessary to describe briefly how rallying works. It's a time trial event where drivers race against time rather than race with each other directly. As there is no simultaneous racing against other cars so the tactics involved with passing others and keeping them from passing you is not an issue. RC follows this formula faithfully in both the simulation and arcade modes.  RC is first and foremost a rally simulation, and in terms of authenticity and detail it ranks with the best driving sims ever produced. The game models the British Rally Championship -- made up of six individual rallies throughout Britain of six stages each. Each stage is faithfully true to the real courses -- so much so that the map to assist you driving is the same one used by real drivers. This Championship can be played with cars from the A5, A6 and A7 classes. To achieve an overall victory you'll probably need to drive in an A7. Not that the other cars are dogs, mind you. If you are able to win the overall Championship a second Championship is unlocked as well as the A8 class of cars. But there are no new tracks here. Sorry, Tennessee.  The 21 cars modeled in the game will have the fans of the sport very excited. Non-fans may be a little surprised to see high performance cars such as the Nissan Micra, Ford Escort, and VW Golf. And once they come across the Hyundai, Proton and Skoda cars they'll be completely perplexed. Licensing is nice but it wouldn't matter much if the cars all handled like Marlon Brando. Fortunately RC excels in this department. It is almost the perfect mix between being able to pick the game up and drive immediately on the one hand and needing a big dose of practice to be a real winner on the other.  The licenses will also slip from the minds of rally fans and gamers alike once the game proper is loaded up and you get a look at the graphics. Developers Magnetic Fields have created a game that looks very close to photorealistic. Cars have been modeled directly on their real world equivalents and look fantastic. The quality of the skins makes you believe you are watching a real car, not merely a complicated polygonal representation of a car.  The environments are similarly detailed with most objects scanned from photographs of the actual rally courses. The realistic look is enhanced further with the inclusion of some nice special effects such as sun glare (realistic and realistically annoying) and rain.  This beauty does of course come at a cost. Heed the minimum specs as only that -- an absolute minimum. It will take nothing short of a PIII or Athlon with a fast video card to get this game running smoothly with all the details turned up. Thankfully though there are enough little options to turn off that will allow you to play the game on a PII and have it still look pretty fantastic.  As I said already, the tracks of RC are modeled on the real-life tracks. Although it profits the gamer in terms of realism, this approach has some down sides. The courses are obviously developed with the goal of making a challenge for professional rally drivers -- not to be fun to play as a computer simulation. For non-rally fans some of the driving may get a little repetitive. Fans of the sport will find the 420 miles of mapped territory to be total bliss.  RC is literally dripping with authenticity in the sound department well. John Horton, manager of the British Rally Championship, introduces stages. If you are a big rally fan then Horton's voice will be instantly recognizable to you. His voice lends authenticity to the game and was definitely more interesting than if the recordings were of a generic US TV presenter. The authentic voices of your navigator raise a similarly problematic situation. The voices of real rally co-drivers Derek Ringer and Claire Mole are used to deliver the pace notes (directions of upcoming turns). It is quite a good feature in rally simulations and works well here. Some players may find Derek's accent a little hard to understand (just think groundskeeper Willie and you'll get the idea). [Ed Note: Who wouldn't love to get pace notes from Groundskeeper Willie? ~I've been rally racing since you were suckling at your mother's teet!~]  Another feature that doesn't add much to the actual game but serves to round out a high quality package is the video replay system. After each stage you have the opportunity to review the entire stage from a multitude of camera angles. The interface makes jumping to particular sections of interest a breeze, and your favorites can be stored away for future viewing. It is a fun little feature that some people can't do without and it is implemented fantastically here.  My only complaint with RC is the slightly disappointing arcade mode. The arcade mode differs from the simulation by featuring a classic countdown clock with time extended for reaching various checkpoints. My disappointment is probably a bit unfair given RC's firm pitch at the sim fans, but I feel the arcade mode could have been improved if some special arcade tracks had been designed. Instead, selected tracks from the simulation are used and are frankly not as exciting as what you might see in V-Rally and the like. Perhaps some more generous driving physics, no car damage or some special cars may have also been features to give the game a better arcade feel. Despite my misgivings, RC does actually fare quite well as an arcade racer and is good for a quick blast around a track you have unlocked.  A multiplayer version was added to the U.S. version of the game to add Internet support and some mano-a-mano fun. First off, the regular multiplayer works on one computer. The first option is for split screen racing. This doesn't mean that you will actually be racing head to head, bumping each other around. All this means is that you'll be able to see each other race the same course at the same time. This adds a little fun to the game as you see your opponent take a turn a little better than you, which makes you want to push the envelope a little farther. The other options are for alternate turn racing. With this, you race a course and then hand over the controls to the next person in line to race the same course. While this gives a chance to see the full screen, and play with up to four people, some of the tracks take a long time to finish. This means that you'll be sitting around for a long time before it's your turn to drive. If you're cool with watching your friends race, then this should be no problem.  You are also given the option to play over the Internet or a LAN connection with up to eight players. Internet play is a mix between the split screen and the alternate racing options. You'll be racing against all of your competitors at the same time, but you wont be able to actually see them race. This eliminates the huge waiting period between races and gives you the whole screen by which to navigate. Overall, the multiplayer doesn't add a whole lot to the game but allows you to test your driving skills against other real people, and adds a bit more fun into an already great game.   So all in all RC looks every bit a winner and really it should come as no surprise. Magnetic Fields and publisher Actualize (previously known as Europress) have a distinguished rally heritage, having produced International Rally Championship and Network Q RAC Rally Championship -- both very popular in their time. Colin McRae Rally then came along to take the lead as the top rally racer. Rally sim fans will then obviously be curious as to how RC compares to CMR. The simple answer is that RC leapfrogs CMR in almost every department. With CMR2 due next year the bar may be raised yet again. It's a good time to be a PC rally racing enthusiast.  If you are a serious rally fan you should not be reading this review -- you should be getting your hands on Mobil 1 Rally Championship. If you aren't a serious rally fan, you probably haven't read this far. Screw you. Fans of driving sims generally should also check out RC while fans of quick action may find themselves being converted to rally nuts.  -- Arun Devidas", "date": "Mar 9, 2000"}
