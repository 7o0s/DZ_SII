Games like Transport Tycoon, Detroit, and Railroad Tycoon head this list, although their scope typically was limited to one industry. Far fewer games have attempted to portray the entire economic dynamic -- from resource extraction and manufacturing to sales and marketing -- in a single simulation, and most of those efforts have been far from memorable.  The one exception has always been Capitalism. First published in 1995 or thereabouts, the Capitalism series was created by Enlight Software, a Hong Kong-based computer game developer, and published in the U.S. by Interactive Magic. Capitalism, along with its enhancement Capitalism Plus, has long been regarded by most critics as the best computer game series about the business world ever published. I'd certainly agree, I've kept and enjoyed my copy for more than five years -- it makes a fun game out of what for me is a very dry subject. And it's not just gamers who agree, Capitalism has been used in business schools as a teaching aid, and as you can see its web page is littered with academic testimonials.  Unfortunately Interactive Magic fell apart a few years ago, while Enlight Software has been busy with its Seven Kingdoms games. So for a while there, it didn't seem like a revamp of this business sim would be in the works. But now Enlight has resurfaced with a new publishing partner, UbiSoft, and a new version of its game, Capitalism 2. So what's the verdict?  In a word, it's all good.  When I first loaded Cap 2, I have to admit being slightly put off by the graphics and interface of the new game. The interface is a bit busy, and it takes some time to learn where all the new buttons are. Also there's this new dynamic city view that shows little people and cars moving around, even some slack-jawed yokels wandering aimlessly back and forth through your stores. At first blush, it's hard to tell what if any purpose any of this graphical glitz serves.  And actually calling it glitz might be a bit of a reach. These graphics aren't state of the art -- even for an isometric-based strategy game, it's a little behind the curve, a little closer to SimCity 2000 than Railroad Tycoon 2. And as far as the character art goes, I could probably make those heads too if I owned a copy of Poser. Those are some really substandard, off the shelf character models.  But all that's essentially irrelevant to the main question: is the sequel better, worse or about the same as the original? Well no worries there. Capitalism 2 preserves the core of the original Capitalism gameplay intact, eliminates and simplifies some of the major bugaboos of the earlier games, and overall presents a superior and far more entertaining product. If you owned the prior games, you'll love the sequel. And if you've never played the first game, you might as well start with this version, since it's the better all around game.  Probably the coolest thing about the Capitalism series is its vast scope. There are more than fifty products for you to manufacture, crops to grow, and technologies to research, in industries as wide-ranging and diverse as clothing, foodstuffs, cars, and computers. Every step of the economic process involved in getting a product into consumers' hands is modeled, beginning with the raw resources. Timber, chemical minerals, iron ore, and the like are mined, while cash crops and animal products are grown on your farms. You can then process your cows into frozen beef for your supermarkets or into leather, and then you can ship that leather to your factories where, combined with other commodities, it can become a sofa, a chair, or a leather briefcase.   From there, you can sell your products to other computer players who own retail stores, or you might want to open your own retail outlets, since maximum profit is derived by controlling every step of the manufacturing and sales process. The major factors in successfully retailing your products include location of your stores, advertising and building brand awareness, the quality of your products (determined by the quality of your raw materials and the training and quality of your factory machinery and workers), the price you set, and of course, what kind of competition there is -- whether it be the default local vendors or the other computer NPC players. Trying to dominate one simple industry like grocery markets can become a bloody, expensive battle, while dominating industry after industry and becoming a sprawling, multi-billion dollar behemoth can be a truly Herculean task.  And that's really just scratching the surface. It can be fun to play just as a farmer, or an R&D specialist, or a retailer (my favorite is to make Satan Industries, specializing in Cigarettes and Beer -- unfortunately, no Firearms), while other times you might decide never to build anything at all and instead become a stock manipulator and takeover specialist.  That latter choice is possible because the game also has an active and lively stock market, in which all the firms in the game, including your own, are traded. This is a crucial part of the game, because at some point, if your initial program of manufacturing and retailing is successful, your stock price is going to skyrocket. Once it does, you can start issuing new shares and raising huge quantities of money, at which point you can start acquiring your competitors on the open market.  But that's no longer the only way to dispose of extra corporate income. In Capitalism 2, you can now invest in real estate and media companies too. That's right, the old TV stations and newspapers that sucked up so much of your advertising dollars in the original games can now be purchased outright, when the owner decides to sell. Owning your own media outlets can be a tremendous competitive advantage when you've got product to move (just ask Disney, Fox, etc.), but be warned these stations generally aren't cheap (and in fact, it'd be interesting if Capitalism 3 actually included more media properties for you to own, so instead of owning just a few local channels here and there, you could become a true Rupert Murdoch or a Ted Turner, owning everything under the sun).  Another outlet for your investment is real estate. This is a very exciting, new feature of the game in which for about ten million dollars, you can open up a brand new office complex or high-rise apartment building in the downtown of your city. Real estate makes for interesting investments, they're fairly stable over a long period of time and don't require the constant outlays of marketing, training, and research dollars that your other businesses demand, yet they are much more tied to local economic conditions (recession, panic, prosperity) than your other industries, so you don't want to put all your cash solely into real estate. One final treat (and this is a nice touch, and perhaps the first bit of personality in the series), is that you can now spend portions of your personal fortune on little mansions that appear in the game. Hey, as the chairman and CEO of a globe-spanning, multi-billion dollar conglomerate, you're damn right I'm going to live in a huge mansion! Not enough games properly reward the player at all anymore, so this was nice to see.  Other snappy new features include multi-store mode. In the previous games, you could put any four products in any retail store, but with this option turned on, you have a more realistic retail challenge -- grocery stores can only stock groceries and those kind of products, department stores stock furniture and clothes, jewelry stores stock jewelry and watches, and so on. You can be sure that Satan Industries will be opening a convenience store stocking cigarettes, beer, and soda pop in every neighborhood!  Another nice new feature is the inclusion of corporate headquarters. While I wouldn't recommend building this expensive money-drain at the start of the game, once your corporation reaches sufficient size, an HQ will let you do things like institute a company-wide training program, set your stock dividend (very important -- best way to pay yourself when you're at high ownership percentage levels), and hire officers to handle many of the day-to-day chores of business-running. You can also now buy from and sell individual firms to your competitors, though the computer AI seems reluctant to dicker, and the game should do a better job of informing you when your competitors are in dire financial straits and might want to sell their ill-conceived ventures for a song (maybe through some automated kind of business newspaper reporting mechanism, I don't know).  Besides these new features, the developers have also ironed out some of the problems in the earlier games. One of the worst, for me anyway, was trying to find a supplier of a particular item, especially after I had just taken over some grossly inefficient computer-run operation through a hostile takeover. It would be tedious to go through store after store trying to make sure they're buying only my products from my company. Now, there's a super-handy supplier list that lets you sort and filter by city, product, or producing company to rapidly sort these problems out. It's also great when starting a new retail location, as it quickly filters out the products that can't be sold in that store.  Along similar lines, the new links that let you view the clients of a factory quickly do the same thing, although in reverse. Now  you can see which if any of your competitors are actually buying stuff from that factory -- and which of your own stores would be affected if you shut down or changed production. There's also a whole multiplayer aspect which I haven't had a chance to delve into yet, but which may offer some additional thrills for those who like to play Capitalism in a group or classroom setting.   All in all, Capitalism 2 is a great game. It successfully carries forward the great play dynamic created by its predecessors but adds enough new stuff and fixes enough old problems to fully justify there being a sequel in the first place. In terms of scope and comprehensiveness, it has no equal in the world of business simulations, and in fact the only things it really fails to address in a business sense are non-market factors, like lawsuits, building permits, bribing politicians, unions, and all that good stuff -- but give them time.  In the mean time, if you're at all interested in economic sims or contemplating a business degree, this one is worth checking out. And with a list price of only $20, this game is a steal -- or to put it in Capitalism terms, it has a Necessity Index of 56.   -- Jason Bates Want to share your opinions with the world?
