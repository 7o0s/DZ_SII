This is exactly what publisher Majesco and developer Skyworks haven't done with their aerial combat game, F-24 Stealth Fighter. Although it bears a striking resemblance to games like Afterburner and Top Gun (NES), it's not nearly as enjoyable as those titles were decades ago. F24 Stealth Fighter is a step backwards in the evolution of the flight combat genre, and the sooner it's forgotten and off game shelves, the better.    As the intro sequence explains, the President has deployed military forces in Iran to stop the sale of nuclear weapons. This is done, presumably, by piloting an F24 around and blowing everything out of the sky. The game is a series of simple missions that involve taking out a specific number of enemy jets, or enemy bases, before returning home. All of this is done through the first-person cockpit, with a control panel on the bottom screen and....well, a control panel on part of the top screen, too. Instead of taking advantage of the two DS screens and leaving the top screen open for just the windshield, the developers cluttered it up with controls and window borders. So, just like in the more excusable GBA version, actual visibility of the horizon is severely limited.    F24 Stealth Fighter isn't an awful game, but it's so dull, predictable and unrewarding that there's really no need to play it. The developers have made so many poor decisions in the game's design and controls, that it's a real chore to play. Even taking this game as a simulation for military aerial combat, without holding it against arcade-style games like Afterburner, it's a mess.    One of the main problems with the game is the lousy interface. Every piece of information is delivered in incredibly small text with little effort made to reinforce this information visually. Swapping between weapons is a trial and error process that usually requires firing a few off (from a very limited supply) before it's apparent what type of weapon is being used. The bottom screen features weapon buttons (a welcome addition over the GBA version of the game) but selecting them with the stylus is glitchy at best.      Controls aren't intuitive at all. As in the GBA version, assignment of the face buttons is unintuitive and confusing. This time around, the developers have added touchscreen support so that gamers can grab the controls directly with the stylus. It's a cool idea, but moving the controls around is so slow and unreliable that the game is ultimately unbeatable without resorting to the D-pad and face buttons. The virtual control stick moves at about a third of the speed it should; move it any faster, and the stylus will slip off. The virtual control panel buttons are similarly unresponsive and don't reliably accept input every time.    To make matters worse, neither the face button control scheme nor the easily-forgotten mission objective can be accessed during gameplay; once a mission has started, players are on their own until it's over. For an example of how this complicates gameplay, some of the sea-bound enemies can only be killed by a certain weapon type. Unfortunately, this information is only given once before the mission, and since all secondary weapons run out after a few shots, kamikaze-ing into the ocean and starting over is often the only option.    Enemy jets in the game move so fast and take so much damage before exploding, it's hard to strategize any attacks and still have time to pull them off. An easier exploit is to turn the plane sideways, circle upward along the horizon and blast enemies each time they come into visibility. Since I'm pretty sure this isn't how real dogfights are won, it's safe to assume the gameplay is broken.    Actually tracking down enemies is an arduous task, due to the over-complicated, inefficient radar system. As the aircraft spins and pivots, white dots representing the enemies appear. Unfortunately, depending on how close the enemy jets are, the radar will swap between multiple, abstract layouts. The radar also has a very short range, making it difficult to see any jets until just before they're about to fly by.    The game moves pretty smoothly with a solid frame rate. It features a detailed control panel and some occasional interesting shots of the pilot, but that's really all this game does acceptably in regard to graphics. Enemies are generally just a single sprite frame and effects are kept very minimal. With such a simple game, some visual flair like smoke trails, larger explosions and more impressive clouds would have added a lot to the experience. Considering what the DS is capable of, a spattering of 3D would have really helped to immerse the player. As it is now, the sky feels very empty.    At the end of each mission, the aircraft must be landed back on the local carrier, an exercise that's too easy and boring. Players tilt their craft left and right to line it up with the ever-nearing carrier. The problem is that once the plane gets close, the game takes over and automatically lands the craft safely. The player doesn't have to worry about pitch or speed or any other factors that a real pilot would. Even sillier, if a landing isn't coming together well, the player can just press up on the D-pad and backpeddle their aircraft several hundred yards; last time I checked, F24s didn't have a gear for mid-flight reverse.    The game offers two difficulty settings (Ace and Novice), as well as invertible controls, adjustable audio levels and the option to practice landing in a variety of locations. Unlike the GBA version, the DS game features a save function. There's also a 4 player local wireless multiplayer mode, requiring one copy of the game per player. But the dog fighting is too boring and locating the other planes is too difficult to be a selling point for the game.   F-24 Stealth Fighter doesn't feel rushed as much as poorly thought out. The game is plain, boring, unstrategic and confusing. Aside from weak touch controls, a poorly-used second screen and snore-inducing multiplayer, the jump to DS added nothing to this game. Fans looking for a fun flight combat game should pick up Star Fox Command instead.", "date": "Mar 26, 2007"}
