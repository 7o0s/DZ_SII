Luckily, that truth is about to change, as we're getting a rare taste of the god/management/strategy genre from Universal Interactive's Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis. Taking the formula of building and managing a theme park further by replacing roller coasters and bumper cars with dinosaurs and man-eaters, JP at least has a degree of originality. Besides, as every videogame fan knows, adding dinosaurs to any concept is a plus. In fact, the developers at Blue Tongue even optimized the controls so the need for keyboard and mouse wasn't even necessary.   Unfortunately, there aren't too many positives to be found in Operation Genesis beyond its welcome concept. As the titles we mentioned earlier do a much better job of capturing the elements of what makes the genre so appealing, and goes to prove further why games of this type are so rarely explored outside of the PC. Let us explore!   Gameplay  Operation Genesis is the main mode and allows you to build your very own version of Jurassic Park. There are missions and exercises separate from Operation Genesis that first teach you and the apply skills that you will need in that main theme park building mode. For those unfamiliar with the genre, the idea is to use an overhead/god's perspective to build a theme park from scratch, choosing the buildings, where they're going to be placed and how much to charge. Games like Roller Coaster Tycoon proved to be popular among older gamers because of the micromanagement functions that allowed you to set the prices of the park's fast food outlets, manage a custodial staff, and handle security all for the purpose of running a profitable and popular amusement business. In the case of Jurassic Park, you're not picking the rides or designing roller coasters, but are creating every element of your dinosaur exhibits including the species of the lizard, their habitat, and how people will experience them.    The combination of playing god and using the strategy to do so actually comes together pretty nicely -- or at least, early on it does. The game works in a multi-tiered system and for every dinosaur you hope to create, you have to first excavate archaeological digs for fossils, the research the genetic material until you have enough to hatch one of those suckers before finally putting the new dino in a habitat. Every single one of those components costs money and the bigger and better dinos (which you can charge more to see) cost you bigger dollars.    Cash management aspects of the game are appropriately rich and fall very much in line with the expected 'tycoon' standard. To be successful, you have to charge and spend in the right balance. You can set how much you want to charge for entrance to the park, to use observation areas, for souvenirs, burgers and dogs and even the bathroom if you feel so inclined. But to keep the flow of customers you'll have to make sure you're meeting their needs and expectations. And the magic of games like this, that Jurassic Park also has, is that it's all trial and error. You won't know you're charging too much for burgers and fries until you read your customer reports or read the people individually and see what they have to say.   That said, it's the strategy concerning the management of your dinosaurs is what ultimately weighs in as the game's supreme weakness. Once you've done the work and paid for actually creating a dinosaur, presenting them in a cost efficient way is your next challenge. Protecting your patrons from vicious carnivores requires that you use a strong enough fence, but at the same time you have to give those T-Rex's something to chew on so that they can remain happy and healthy. If you don't, people will complain that your lizards are too boring or too sickly.   Different creatures have different likes and dislikes too, so you'll have to pay attention to the differences between herbivores and carnivores. Some like to have plenty of their same species around them, some like to be alone, some like lots of trees, some like people, some like to eat certain prey but not others. It's great that there's that there's so much to account for in creating your eco-system, but it takes such an exorbitant amount of time to figure this stuff out, that you'll be pulling your hair out after the first 10 hours or so.    Additionally, the game burdens you with a board of directors that want to see your profits rise no matter what. And ~no matter what~ includes ill-timed natural disasters that do damage to your park (which must be repaired with revenue from the gate, but then again, nobody will visit a place that has natural disasters -- they stay away). This kind of time and economic pressure is good because it's accurate, but as a gameplay mechanic it's unintuitive and utterly confusing. Pick up and play isn't an option here.   One component that doesn't quite work are the ~action~ sequences that allow players to drive the JP Land Cruiser on a Safari Adventure attraction while taking photographs or flying the Ranger helicopter to tranquilize rampaging dinosaurs. You can't ride roller coasters in this one, so we suppose that these elements are an attempt to immerse you in your park, but the helicopter sniping and Pokemon Snap driving moments aren't as engaging as they should be.   Graphics  JP isn't too visually impressive despite it's occasional detailed texture. Repetitive and bland, the environments are nothing but the same trees and mountains in tropical locales, and that's it. Nothing else to speak of really, except simplistic buildings, barriers, and robot people who move like they're packing 600lbs in their back pockets.   At least the camera in done rather well and shows presents some pretty good angles. The zoom function allows you to seamlessly move from a super wide perspective, where you can see several structures that make up your park, to an extremely tight shot locked onto an individual patron. And to it's credit, it's kind of cool to be able to see the park nestled up against mountains and jungles and instantly zoom in on your park's hamburger stand.   The dinosaurs themselves aren't exactly dazzling but they're animated with sophisticated believable moves. You'll be able to recognize a pack of raptors on the hunt or a triceratops frolicking with another in an open space. They move beautifully even if the models themselves aren't all that impressive with their washed out browns and earth tones.    Sound  You'll learn to love or hate the Jurassic Park theme music as you play. Orchestrated well by the Melbourne Symphony, it pops up so often enough that you're likely to forget anything else you hear.   Audio effects are limited to roaring and yelping dinos (when you're close enough to hear them) vehicle sounds, and weather. We don't know if the dinos are making accurate noises, but they sound a lot like the creatures from the movies, so that's got to count for something. There isn't much voice in Operation Genesis either. And other than a few voice snippets from complaining advisors or the occasional PA announcement, your interaction with humans is very rare. At least it sounds good.Jurassic Park could be a hoot for serious dinosaur enthusiasts but not necessarily for tycoon addicts or movie fans. Since I don't fall into either category I can objectively say that JP at best an average game with a few extra points given for effort. As good as the control system may be, the game doesn't work as effectively on a console as it would on PC. I wouldn't ask for more action because that's not what the game is about, but as it is, it doesn't do the genre well enough to be considered something extraneously worth your time.", "date": "Mar 26, 2003"}
