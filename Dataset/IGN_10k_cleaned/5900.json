{"name": "Pac-Match!", "name_review": "Pac-Match", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/07/27/pac-match", "text": "Puzzle fans in search of their next fix can seek the companionship of gaming's greatest icon, Pac-Man, in Namco's Pac-Match. The yellow gobbler is celebrating his 25th birthday this year, making it a perfect time to check in with the arcade game that swallowed your allowance as a child -- or at, it swallowed your dad's.   Pac-Match offers up fifty puzzle screens with a singular challenge -- clear the multi-colored shapes (or Pac-Man icons, which is my preferred look) by linking up them up with their twins. As you remove blocks, the rest cascade down. The ultimate goal is to clear the screen. Now, you can botch these puzzles and end up with a few un-linkable blocks, which results in having to start the puzzle over.   The game is remarkably simple, but that's what I dig about it. It's not necessarily as deep as, say, Glu's PopCap games, but there is certainly entertainment here. With fifty puzzles you can choose from, you can easily sneak in a board or two between classes or meetings. And should one puzzler prove to be a real pickle, you can skip it and try another, coming back to it later on.   Pac-Match has a nice, clean look to it -- all of the icons are very easy to distinguish from each other, even as the screen gets more populated with a greater number of blocks. If you are a real casual puzzle fan, Pac-Match is a great download. The game is incredibly easy to slip in and out of, and with only one goal (clear the screen) and no bonus bricks or any of that stuff, there's no learning curve. I also like that you can select puzzles. There were a few boards that I just couldn't wrap my head around, so I moved on to the next one and kept on jamming. While hardly revolutionary, Pac-Match hits all of its marks and delivers solid puzzle fun.", "date": "Jul 27, 2005"}
