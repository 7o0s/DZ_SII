This is one of the worst games to ever actually see a commercial retail release in the United States. No, seriously.   China Warrior casts you in the role of a nameless martial arts master, shamelessly based on Bruce Lee but having none of his charisma. You appear onscreen as a huge sprite, taking up almost a third of the display's real estate with your gigantic body alone -- this was the selling point of China Warrior back in 1989. Its overly large characters were meant to gather the same ~oohs~ and ~aahs~ as the big boxers in Nintendo's Punch-Out!!, setting the game apart from similar titles that used only standard, smaller sprites.   Just like a Bruce Lee movie? You walk constantly to the right, even without pressing the D-Pad in that direction -- that's right, it's automatic. You can stop the forward march by crouching or jumping up, which covers two of the total four actions you can take in the game. The others are punching and kicking, but you can't punch in the air, and you can't kick while crouched.   But of course you can't. It would just make too much sense to be able to actually attack the enemies running at you from the right side of the screen with more than a single standard strike. China Warrior sends waves of baddies toward your karate man and you kick them; then more come and they get kicked too. Occasionally there's a boss battle, won also by button-mashing the kick trigger and requiring about as much strategy as it takes to press the power button to turn this game off.China Warrior's insultingly simple take on the side-scrolling brawler formula just serves to elevate the appeal of other TurboGrafx fighters like Vigilante. Its enormous sprite graphics were mildly impressive two decades ago, and its music actually isn't all that bad. But the gameplay is just far too restrictive, unoriginal and boring. Don't go anywhere near this stinker, as absolutely any other game currently available is more worth your money. Yes, even The Legend of Kage.", "date": "Jun 29, 2007"}
