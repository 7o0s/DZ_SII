The great Nintendo Mario Kart formula has been trampled to death with mascots, deserving and undeserving, and now it's Disney's turn, with Toy Story Racer. Skeptical, uninterested, and ready to throw the controller down at any second before I had even played it, Toy Story Racer had me smiling and laughing and admiring the backgrounds and the kart physics. I had once again been beaten by the great kart racer trap (simple game, formulaic concept, obvious mascots...you know what I mean).   Gameplay Toy Story Racer is really a kid's game, but it sports such clever level design and car physics that it's bigger than a mere kid's game. In a wonderful nod to simplicity, everything about the game is easy to get to grips with, from the menu to the controls to kinds various kinds of games themselves. It's engrossing, fast, and goofy, and I like it.  Players take on the role of as many as 10 different Toy Story characters, from Woody to Buzz to Hamm, and Mr. Potato Head to Little Bo Peep to RC, the remote controlled car. Each character sports his or her own vehicle, and every one drives slightly different than the rest. The games are quite diverse, too, which is nice, because in every other kart racing game you see, you'll just race though a bunch of courses. Here, you may race in a three-race set, take on a straight single-race course, chases, collection-quests, or you may enter into a Twisted Metal-esque car combat battle, sans the violence, that is. In fact, there are more than 100 different challenges overall.  The karts themselves aren't nearly as interesting, however, as the environments on which they race. Traveller's Tales have gone out of their way to create more than 30 racing environments in which to race of do battle, and in this day and age of 15 courses max, that's quite impressive. The courses boast shortcuts and long cuts, and sometimes sneaky dead-ends that are totally unexpected and may devastate your positioning.   What's especially cool about the tracks is how they are re-creations of the environments from Toy Story and Toy Story 2. Players drive through entire houses, including shooting into vents systems, under beds, around back yards, into kitchens, many of which sport interactive backgrounds. The courses show off multiple surfaces that affect the way you drive, too. For instance, you may drive from a rug into a kitchen floor, and not only does that kitchen floor shine and reflect beautifully, but it is actually slippery, too. Spin out by accident is a common occurrence if care is not taken. Watery surfaces and other strange areas, such as bowling alley lanes also create great slippery surfaces to, erm, get to grips with...   And for those players who love to just futz around, the karts and the environments are perfect for that. All sorts of jumps made of shelves, stairs, and whatnot make for great airtime. Plus, when jumping into the air and landing on another racer actually propels you back into the air. I actually bounced up into air about five times once, before hitting the ground. It was silly fun, and I liked it. Not to be forgotten, the vehicles all sport incredible sensitive shocks, which affect the cars as they drive, too. You may be surprised to know it, but by just checking the replays, in case the actual driving didn't convince you, to see how much bouncing the cars do on specific courses.   As with all good kart games, the courses are filled with power-ups, too. These appear in the form of little boxes, like presents, and appear and disappear often, adding a little extra to their normal function. Power-ups include Magic 8-Balls, rockets, electric shocks, speed boosts, toy space ships, and bouncing balls, all of which are kids' toys and which fit perfectly into the Toy Story universe.   Graphics In the visual sense of things, Toy Story Racer is a better than average looking game, which rises above the crowd in several areas. First and foremost, the characters look spot-on, so you can play as your favorite character and they look pretty darn close to the 'real' thing. The courses are amazingly detailed and imaginative. Players take on the role of the toys themselves, and the environments are large scale, so you really feel like a tiny little toy.   Another note about the graphics are that shiny, reflective surfaces that seem to appear everywhere. It's not like reflective surfaces haven't be done before, but they're just good, that's all, and they worked. My eye was tricked, you know?   Sound While the real live-actors' and actresses' voices from the movie weren't used here in the game, Activision corralled a few good voice actors to do some respectable voice imitations of Hamm, Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the crew. The best voice has to be Buzz, who may be easy to imitate, but the actor just nailed it, you know with too much talk, the right intonation, etc.   The music is a little too Christmas-y and cute, if you know what I mean, and it's definitely geared toward a younger audience. So, if you're buying this for yourself, and you happen to be 20-30, the music will definitely grate on your nerves. However, if you have a kid or two, they'll almost assuredly love the music, which is cute, poppy, and jingly.Toy Story Racer is aimed at young kids, but it's surprisingly adult in the level of detail, depth of gameplay, and its overall design. I was surprised to play it and enjoy it more than most of the kart racers I've played before, and guess what? I've played WAY too many kart racers for my own good. So, I know my kart races, for best or worst. If you want to get a fun little kart racer for yourself, a newbie gamer, or your kids, do yourself a favor and go out and buy Toy Story Racer.", "date": "Mar 9, 2001"}
