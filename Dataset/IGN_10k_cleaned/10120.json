I was cursing within a few minutes of starting it up. When Dynamix, one of the leaders in the flight sim arena, comes out with a game, I'm usually optimistic. I mean, I cut my teeth on Aces of the Pacific and the original Red Baron, so I've got a soft spot for this company. But Curse You! Red Baron just doesn't measure up. Its arcade style action is as flat as the graphics.  The flight model isn't very good either. Even the more maneuverable planes, like the Fokker Dr. I and the S.E. 5a, are difficult to handle. The planes just don't respond to your direction. In an accurate WWI flight sim, you would expect the planes to be a little sluggish, but in this game, it just becomes irritating. And the game even played a little choppy on a 450MHz machine. Add to that the fact that I had to play with the keyboard, and you've got one unhappy gamer. The game hints at joystick support, but I never found a screen in the game that even offered me the option to use a joystick. What the (censored)?  I will say that the individual plane performance models are unique. Each plane flies differently than the others. The Spad has an unparalleled dive and the Sopwith Camel is very unstable along all axes. You'll also notice a difference in the planes' performance at different altitudes. Each plane also has its own cockpit graphic. Dynamix has also included a ~translucent~ cockpit to give you the edge in dogfighting. I imagine that this is what it looks like to fly Wonder Woman's Invisible Jet. Translucent cockpits are, unfortunately, only available for those gamers who have a 3D card. The rest of you just have to make do.  There are 8 flyable planes in Curse You! Red Baron--four for the Jerrys and four for the Allies. The two worst planes are the Albatross D Va and the Nieuport. They are historically sluggish, but it's good that both are included, because they were major fighters of the war. Their lack of performance is well modeled. Each side has a ~tank~ plane, too--the German Pfalz D III and the British Spad XIII. The two best fighters of the war were the Fokker D VII and the S.E. 5a. They're here too. The Fokker Dr. I and the Sopwith Camel are also included. Both are highly maneuverable and dangerous in the hands of skilled pilots.  There are three game types in CY!RB (this is an acronym?). In Dogfight mode, you pick your plane and one of three difficulty levels. The game drops you into the cockpit in mid flight with an enemy right in front of you. Once you down the enemy pilot, another flies in to take his place. As far as I know this just keeps going on until you get shot down or decide to quit. The Red Baron Challenge is almost exactly like the Dogfight mode, except you'll be facing the greatest aces of the war. Beat enough of them and you win the coveted Medal of Honor.  In Hotseat mode, you can go head to head with up to five other pilots in a timed arena. You take turns in a hotseat style game earning points and downing enemy planes. The player with the most points at the end wins.  There are no ~missions~ in the game per se. There aren't even any wingmen. You play this game entirely by yourself, against from one to five opponents. There's little sense of accomplishment in the game. It's just shooting down one plane after another. I know, I know. Most other sims are like that too but this one just seems lifeless.  So lets talk about the look of the game, shall we? The textures on the planes are fairly (or unfairly, I guess) flat. There's no dynamic lighting. In fact, there doesn't seem to be any lighting at all, dynamic or otherwise. Smoke effects and fog are nice and stand out as a result. Weapons fire looks good but the impact of bullets on planes is pretty unrealistic. Damage is represented visually, but usually only after several hits. In terms of explosions, I didn't ever see any. The terrain makes you feel as if you're flying over a board game, and the houses and trees only reinforce this impression. I will say that having trees on the ground is great for giving you a sense of altitude.  Those of you out there with good deductive reasoning skills will be able to predict that I'm unhappy with the overall impression made by this game. It half-asses the whole arcade approach to the game. I totally respect the concept of watering a product down for the masses, but Curse You! Red Baron has lost the excitement of air combat in the process. Lack of realism is okay, but the last thing a WWI air combat sim should be is boring.   -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Aug 6, 1999"}
