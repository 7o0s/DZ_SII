I've loaded her up with the choicest components, from sweet reactors looted from enemy ships to reliable countermeasures bought at the galaxy's bazaar. From the orbital space station outside of Yavin, I head to the waypoint and await a rebel cruiser carrying precious...well, whatever it is, I'm sure it's precious. Listen, I don't escort cargo if it ain't precious.  After the transport arrives, I follow it to its new departure point and protect it from enemy attacks made along the way. TIE Fighters swoop in constantly, attacking in force and often backed up by more powerful TIE Interceptors and Bombers. As they make passes on the Rebel smuggler, I fall in behind them where I can and unload an assfull of laser on them. New enemies swarm in as the old are defeated until, eventually, the smuggler's ready to jump out of the system. My mission done, I head down to the Labor Outpost near Yavin to get new orders from my Rebel contact.  This is a typical experience in the first Galaxies expansion, Jump to Lightspeed and if that type of mission sounds fun to you, you're in luck; Jump to Lightspeed is going to give you the chance to play it all night long. In fact, often that's all you'll have the chance to do until you amass enough experience points to move on and repeat the process all over again with a new set of tougher challenges and more distant rewards.  While the addition of space combat is a welcome addition to the series (at least for anyone who isn't currently longing for the ground combat revamp), the biggest problem with this expansion is that it takes far too long to reach the higher skill levels. Now I'm all for increasing the thresholds at which you get new skills but the ramp up here is so steep that you'll find yourself playing for hours and hours trying to get enough experience points to earn that new level. And once you get that level you have to play for hours and hours and hours and hours to get the next level.   Admittedly, one man's bread is another man's excruciatingly monotonous crawl towards the next skill level, but even players who are already satisfied with the pace of character advancement in Galaxies may find that the space encounters are much less varied than the encounters you could have as a scout or marksman. On that topic, there are some space missions that require some ground-based adventuring for certain pilots.  Many of the pilot missions are endlessly repetitive. I appreciate the fact that there are missions that you can jump in and out of at will: hunting fighters is fun and profitable no matter how little or how much time you have to play. But after you've spent four or five hours hunting the same ships, or after you've run the smuggler escort missions three or four times, you start to yearn for something new, something less generic. If you train a new skill, you may be rewarded with a new storied mission but then it's right back to the grind again.  To compensate for these shortcomings, there are a few practical conveniences that pilots enjoy. To begin with, piloting skills don't eat up skill points. This leaves you free to develop as a pilot without the fear that you're using up valuable brain space. (The shipwright functions as any of the other artisan professions and does require skill points.) Once past the initial levels of their profession, pilots can also use hyperspace-enabled ships to travel from one end of the galaxy to the other completely free of charge.  I've already talked about the excitement of combat in our First Impressions of the game. What I said then about the combat being faithful to the universe and well-designed is still true. The best thing about the expansion is the combat. Even with the problems with the content and challenge level, I think that the combat has a real visceral appeal. Playing with the joystick is the way to go for me, but the mouse and gamepad support should allow you to remain competitive no matter which controller type you prefer.  Though this is an action-oriented game, ships are limited by the components you have installed. Sure, reactions count for something but a good player can only make up so much for having a crappy ship. There's a very broad range of components (not even including the custom jobs that shipwrights can create), so you'll be able to make your ship exactly the way you want it.      The enemy AI is pretty good. Ships that attack in groups are particularly tricky simply because enemies can come at you from more than one direction. The real challenge comes not from a smarter enemy but from a better-equipped one. It's the individual components more than pilot reactions that determine how fast, how maneuverable and how deadly each ship is.  Fortunately, space combat yields lots and lots of components as loot. Picking up the odd engine here, the rare shield generator there, you'll have a formidable inventory of ship components you can use to customize your fighter. Those that you don't need can be sold to generate money for custom items or new ship designs. Flying is definitely an expensive hobby, but in terms of whether or not new players could start this expansion and be competitive with the more established players, the only advantage that veterans will have is their starting bankroll.   Even with the profitable nature of space fights, I still hate the almost total reliance on a player run economy. You can at least pay an NPC to repair your ship, thank god, but anything else you want to do depends on the abilities and appraisals of other players. I spent a good part of last night searching for a shipwright who could build my next ship.  I eventually found the guy who had sold me my first Y-Wing but his asking price for this new ship was way too steep. I can't blame him (or even doubt that he was gouging me) because he seemed to be the only person on my server who could build the new ship. This afternoon I finally found someone who made me the new ship for an eighth of the price the first seller offered.   It's not hard to see how this system is, if not clearly abusive, at least very confusing. I'm sure it'll stabilize in time but currently it's hard to find higher level items or to know the value of an item. Some may prefer to see these challenges as additional challenges that make certain acquisitions especially meaningful. It's still aggravating to gain access to a new level in the game and find yourself held back because other players aren't able to unlock some of the new features you've earned.  And all this fuss is over upgrading to a ship that's essentially the same as the ship I'm currently flying. True, it can mount an additional, pilot-fired weapon and this is a significant advantage. But when that's the only reward for a few hours earning experience and when you have to spend additional time hunting across the galaxy seeking another player who can make that reward a reality for you, the fun of combat starts to fade.  Though the launch has been relatively smooth, there are still a handful of bugs to be ironed out. Beyond the occasional crash, we're still encountering starports that disappear and getting stuck on a tree when we land on Endor's moon. We haven't experienced any of the other reported bugs ourselves but, since this is a persistent online game, most of these should be fixed eventually. Some other conveniences would be welcome. The locked encounters are nice for preventing kill stealing, for example, but there ought to be a way for the targeting computer to ignore enemies that are off limits to you.  The screenshots show that the game looks great and how faithful it is to the Star Wars universe. The X-Wings and TIE Fighters and Corellian Corvettes all really sell the experience. I'm got a little sick of staring at the ass of my Y-Wing, but it was authentic at least. The cockpits are amazing, even if the dials and readouts and whatnot are mostly meaningless. Just getting a look at the inside of the ships is enough for some of us.  Weapons effects are nicely varied from one weapon type to another. Some of the blasts leave little ripples as they tear through space. That's a very nice touch. The explosions and disintegrating ships leave a little to be desired but only because the ship models and weapon fire looks so good.  The environments are also striking. Large planets, tumbling asteroids, milky nebulae -- the phenomena are phenomenal. Better still, it's not overdone. Some games show you so much stuff that you instantly know it's fake. Jump to Lightspeed manages to make space an interesting but not unnatural looking place.  The sound design is as solid as it is in the core game. There are a lot of new sounds here, what with the spaceships and all, so the integration is pretty impressive, even if the quality isn't necessarily surprising. The music is just right too and you can often know the instant before things are about to go horribly wrong just by listening for that martial cue. Well, the action parts are fine but the repetitive content and slow skill progression are just too frustrating. Players who have made it through a few professions on the ground will have some idea of the investment required to master piloting or ship creation but keep in mind that you can only work on piloting skills while in space. The journey to master pilot tests your patience more than your skills or inventory.People who are already enjoying playing Galaxies should get Jump to Lightspeed to complete the overall experience. It adds a vital component to the game in terms of content (i.e. flying in space) and in terms of convenience (i.e. having your own ride from place to place). It's harder to justify Jump to Lightspeed for the new player who's primarily interested in getting the space experience. It's rewarding in the short term but it grows tedious too quickly.", "date": "Nov 5, 2004"}
