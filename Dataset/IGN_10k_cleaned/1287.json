Galaga for the Game Boy Color is just as bad as the company's previous classic remakes such as Super Breakout and Centipede -- if you were a fan of the original Namco shooter, you'll sneer at what's been done here. If you've never played the game ever, you'll be bored to tears. Either way, this doesn't make for a smart GBC purchase.  Features Four different background locations Password save Only for Game Boy Color Galaga was released in the arcades back in 1980 as a take on the popular Space Invaders design -- it was more a sequel of its semi-bland Galaxian game, offering more action and scoring elements than its predecessor. Galaga offered two innovations -- one was its clever ~captured ship~ element where you could sacrifice one of your own fighters to the waves of aliens, just to earn an opportunity to get it back as a second gun. The second element was its fun Challenging Stage intermissions to practice your quick shooting skills without the risk of losing one of your ships. Galaga had already been done on the Game Boy hardware years ago, by Namco and by Nintendo -- I pulled up a copy of the Namco version, and that version was a super smooth, fast, and accurate  (albeit black and white only) version of the two-decade old classic shooter. Something must've gone wrong in the design pitch at Majesco, because this really isn't Galaga -- it's a bastardization of the concept. I'd much rather play the black-and-white version than plug this version in my system again.  The problem is, the designers worried more about putting a detailed scrolling background behind the action than actually creating a decent game engine. The sprites are so much larger than they were before, and (I'm assuming it's to get around the 10-sprite-per-line limitation) the enemies will line up outside the visible screen, forcing the screen to scroll left and right. Other problems are here, too -- there's no bonus Challenging Stage for one thing...and remember the ~captured ship~ element? It's here, but when an alien steals one of your ship, it doesn't count against your reserve. This goes against everything that the classic Galaga was designed to be.  Not only this, but the game is incredibly easy -- once you double up your ships, it's all a matter of memorizing the pattern that the enemies show up on screen...you're nearly unstoppable.  And here, again, is where Galaga for the Game Boy Color fails to emulate the design of the classic -- aliens will follow the exact pattern at every level. They don't change. All you have to do is line up your ships under the same location every time, wiggle your ships back and forth, and press the A button rapidly. I plowed through 24 levels without breaking a sweat, and boredom settled in well before that. Even if you've never played the classic, you'll find Galaga blander than white toast. After playing the brilliant Q*Bert and Frogger 2 games released at the same time, I can't help but be extremely disappointed at what happened to this portable remake. If you need a Galaga fix, I highly suggest tracking down the original Game Boy version from some used location.", "date": "Sep 28, 2000"}
