After Aliens and Predator, the fictions of both series' went into a terrible slump. Predator 2 taught us all how a cheesy movie without Arnold Schwarzenegger is an even cheesier movie, but it's the films in the Alien series after James Cameron's epic that stung the most. A bald Weaver and a preachy Roc made decent prey for a dog-born Xenomorph in part three, but couldn't save the fiction from being utterly desecrated in the obscene filth that was Resurrection, a movie we'd all very much like to forget, but need around to produce a few hearty, embarrassment riddled laughs from time-to-time.  If anything can wash the horrible taste of the goober alien being sucked out of the tiny shuttle hull breach at the glorious climax of Resurrection away, it's the PC and the UK. The British know crap when they see it. That's why the Queen Mother ordered the intrepid UK developers at Rebellion to create the first PC iteration of Aliens vs. Predator in '99 (note that the development house also brought a game of the same name and premise to the Atari Jaguar many years earlier). A cult hit and way ahead of its time technologically, AvP PC became an instant classic, either loved or hated by the general gaming populous, but never denied.   Falling on the love side of the fence, Monolith then set out to develop the title's sequel, a more mass market friendly LithTech powered game was created and suddenly the whole world saw that things weren't all sappy Sigourney and decrepit action hero Danny.  But AvP 2 had its limits, so in comes this Third Law developed expansion pack, Primal Hunt. Psycho Circus does not make the best of resumes, but that shouldn't stop the developers from taking the first game and just generally making it better, better, better. Right?  Wrong.  Go to a future dominated by Wayland Yutani, Colonial Marines, and vicious Xenomorphs. Now travel back in time from that point. 500 years ago a Predator discovered a mysterious artifact on LV1201 that would supposedly stave off the Aliens and even grant its user the power to control them. In using it, the fool got his dreadlocks caught in some kind of Pilot powered technological cross between a refrigerator and a pencil sharpener. For five centuries he lay dormant, unable to polish his pretty skulls and proudly display the spleens of his foes to prospective mates.   You know, Mary, I ripped that man's backbone out with my bare paw.  Everything was copasetic until a corporate mercenary named Dunya got out of the shower, deprived her boyfriend of sex (yes, this is a scene from the game) and inadvertently unleashed the Pred while grabbing the artifact. Now the race is on. Dunya's trying to escape with the artifact; the Predator is trying to take it back; and a hybrid PredAlien is trying to destroy it, thus preserving the sanctity of the hive. It's something like that, anyway. I don't really care to remember.  Once again, Primal Hunt incorporates three playable campaigns (one for each race and each consisting of a measly, but add-on acceptable, three missions). That's not much for a game, but it's plenty for an expansion. Add turret guns, deployable sentry guns, dual pistols, the Predator energy flechette (rapid fire energy weapon), four new multiplayer maps (including ancient Predator ruins), a new 360 degree motion tracker, Predator self-destruct for multiplayer, PredAlien rejuvenation through eating foes, and two new indigenous creatures, and you have quite the solid FPS add-on. Now ruin them all and you have Primal Hunt.  Gameplay is rudimentary, frustrating, and incredibly dry to say the least. Unlike the original AvP 2, Primal Hunt is all about leading players through claustrophobic caves, canyons and corridors, and then spawning no-gooders from behind. They immediately run right in your face and then jerk around like crazy. You shoot in every direction and sustain heavy damage. If still alive, the game proceeds. That is the entire gist of the Marine campaign and most of the Predator's. Our friend the Alien involves more insane running and precise attacking than anything.  I didn't complain about the limited and initially non-present saves in the first AvP because it kept people from succumbing to the thirty-second quick save temptation. But sissies couldn't handle the dark or take the scare. So in came AvP 2 and its more accessible arcade shooter style of play with far less fright and far more action. Still, it managed to be successful because there were ample dosages of both approaches, paced and spaced appropriately. Primal Hunt, on the other shunned hand, has one big fat syringe filled with bullet expenditure and lame enemy placement. Obviously, it also comes with a very unwanted side effect: F6 and F9 abuse. Save and load, baby. Save and load. Get your fix, sissy.  Indeed this is a far cry from a Rebellion made AvP that forced the marine to approach every new door and corner with caution, because what was around the other side was lethal and fast (it was still possible for that marine to overcome without resorting to embracing one of the most glaring faults of poor game design). Back then it was important to spin and seek, shoot and panic, flee and fight. Here it's a simple matter of rushing in, expecting and then meeting inevitable death, and then rushing your finger over to the quick load button.       Even Dunya's fangled motion tracker is useless. Since enemies almost always spawn in extreme proximity to you, an event that's always accompanied by overpowering music, there's no need for it all. No need translates to no quiet bleep, no boding evil, no apprehension. The game becomes so predictable so quickly that I never felt pride in narrowly escaping a swarm. I never yelped as a blip on the tracker turned to a very real and deadly alien. I never shouted war cries at the top of my lungs after dispatching a foe that thought he had the jump on me.  And it's the only way to play. Attempting to avoid death by claw and bite is nearly impossible thanks to the angular, confined, and oft obstructing interiors and the equally absurd exterior locales dotted with death falls and soil dwelling worms that seem to lurk in far too many places.  If you like trial and error, you'll love this. If you solve simple mathematical problems like 45 + 10 by starting at 45 + 1 and slowly moving on past 45 + 2 and up to 45 + 10, eventually coming to the correct solution, then you'll be happier than a clam.  Primal Hunt may be short, and it may play poorly, but it nevertheless has a full three campaigns. Even though none are enthralling, they still exist and thus serve as a passable diversion for the utmost extreme AvP 2 player who must indulge him or herself if not only because the game is in a box and at a store. Me and you? I think we long for more of the original AvP. Take away the excessive trigger holding and mouse swinging that comes from dropping speedy aliens three feet behind the player, and please replace it with something more like the Aliens film, which actually was more anxiety and atmosphere than action. This is not what we're looking for.  Take a large step back, insult and slap away the fundamentals of what made AvP and AvP 2 so addictive, pleasantly terrifying, and delightfully cool in the first place and then throw in a pathetic fraction of Serious Sam that's more akin to Carnivores and you'll find yourself here. The campaigns of Primal Hunt are simply not scary, suspenseful, original, engrossing, or immersing. Unfortunately, those are all features that made the Aliens vs. Predator series of games what they are. Sure, this one looks like the others, quacks like the others, and even waddles and flies like them. But it is not a duck.  What did you think of Primal Hunt?  Balancing in the new additions is a bit questionable, as they come with enough flaws that those familiar with the game and its arsenal will likely not spend much time with them. After seeing what was new, I switched back to what was old since the previous assortment of destruction delivery is for most parts far more effective and familiar. Never thought you'd see the day when the Predator would use what amounted to a machinegun, did you?   Even graphics and sound suffer. What's identical to the original is identical to the original, and thus very good. What's new is out of place. I still disagree with the very NOLF-esque animated and colorful look to the characters (as they fit into this universe), but I take greater offense to the new indigenous life forms, which serve no other purpose than to bother and be ugly. Technically they work and look good, artistically they'd be more appropriate in a Turok game. This expansion is both good and bad. The good is that it adds a fairly significant amount of new content: a few multiplayer maps, new weapons, new story, new characters, etcetera... These are all terrific; however (I'll bet that one could be seen a mile away), none of the above comes particularly well developed. The storyline is a bit farfetched and further moves the fiction away from its unstoppable monsters versus merciless hunter versus hapless and greedy humans motif by introducing and prominently featuring elements that are not in keeping with the nature of the beast. It's like when Transformers introduced the Head Masters just subsequent to the motion picture's debut. It seemed like a good idea, but it was all downhill from there. Granted, that is a subjective account. I did not create the Aliens/Predator fiction, so my expectations of how it should be delivered are my own; however (I'm big on the word because it's easy to spell), the rest of the game is clearly substandard by any metric. Play is derived from the oldest and most aggravating of shooting formulas and the newness associated with the expansion and its contents are wholly unnecessary, nonfunctional, or just kind of there.What's left is a noble attempt to further expand the experience of a noble game. But attempts are just that. When the actual delivery of an idea fails, what's left is a product that takes some of the best concepts of gaming, science fiction and add-on ideology, and never actually weaves them together into something of worth.Boring, stale, frustrating and plain, Primal Hunt tarnishes the good AvP name and pulls us further out into a cartoonish and overtly straightforward sea when all we want to do is get back to the beach and be scared out of our wits by a less arcadey, more involved alien menace.Its premise is its saving grace.", "date": "Aug 22, 2002"}
