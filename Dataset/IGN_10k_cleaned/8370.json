Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/13/for-liberty-review", "text": "Last year Hussar Games released For Liberty!, a wargame that offered players a chance to relive the heyday of both the American Revolution and the Rakoczi War of Independence against Austria. Both games have been picked up and republished by Matrix games (with a free version of Hussar's original 1848 game thrown in for good measure). Seeing the game land on our desks recently gave us a great excuse to revisit the glories of the Age of Enlightenment when war was an affair for brightly uniformed infantry, daring cavalry charges and thundering cannonades.  Given the glut of World War 2 and Napoleonic wargames, it's nice to see a title offer up not one but two alternatives for the hex-happy set. The American War for Independence is surely an attractive setting for most wargamers and the Austrian War, discounting our unfamiliarity with the place names, is nearly as compelling. While the campaigns don't enjoy the obvious popularity of Waterloo or Normandy, there's no denying the drama contained in these wars of revolution.   There are two full campaigns for each war and a number of smaller campaigns that focus on just a few years of action. A reasonably thorough, if not overly friendly, tutorial will get players up to speed on the basics in short order. From there, however, players will find that even the smaller campaigns are a lot to take on right at the start. Even smaller campaigns focusing on isolated events from each war would definitely help ease players into the experience a bit more easily. Additionally, the large scope of both wars and the slow pace of the strategic and tactical components makes it hard to maintain interest or awareness in the overall shape of either campaign, leaving less experienced players feeling like they've taken on far more than they can handle.  The main point in each campaign is to accumulate victory points by capturing towns owned by your enemy. The towns serve as sources of income in the form of men, material and morale. Owning is not only the goal but also the means to achieving that goal. Taking towns also grants the player influence points which can be spent for political or material goals. You might use it to buy new units for your armies, or you might use it to spread propaganda to reduce enemy morale.  At the end of the campaign, the side with the most points wins. Discounting the inclusion of specific strategic objectives driven by political or geographical considerations, it's a nice way to determine a player's overall success or failure. For Liberty! forces players to measure success or failure in a variety of degrees. Because the game values morale over manpower, there are few clear winners in the tactical battles. Likewise, the strategic map has far too many towns for players to mount a comprehensive defense, which leaves you with the obnoxious responsibility of having to chase an unopposed enemy as he marches through your unprotected towns.   While it's historically accurate that few Revolutionary battles achieved a clear decision, we found it a bit anti-climactic to have a 20,000 man battle decided with only a few hundred casualties on each side. Trying to actually eliminate an enemy unit is next to impossible. Instead, you'll find yourself attacking them again and again in successive turns until their morale is completely shattered. Accurate it may be, but fun it ain't.  While moving armies overland and planning city sieges is fun, the most obvious drama in the game comes from the tactical battles. When two armies meet up, you're taken to a random (but geographically appropriate) map where you'll fight things out tactically. For Liberty! renders the tactical battles with all the elements wargamers expect: formation and facing controls, movement points, morale models, terrain and weather modifiers, ammo and supply levels, etc. Using the same hex-format of the strategic map, players will position and move their forces in hopes of forcing the enemy to retreat from the field. The hex-format serves the game well but it definitely makes for some staggered infantry lines and some awkward battery facing. While it's a readily accepted convention of the genre, it's hard for it not to seem a bit outdated.      The maps really aren't different enough from each other to give you much sense of variety. Basically, the only distinguishing characteristic of a map is whether or not it has a city or a river on it somewhere. Replaying the same infantry, cavalry and cannon match ups can get a bit dull as well but as that's a historical limitation, there's not much the designers can do about that. One thing they should have done, however, is include a system that lets you know which of your units have already moved that turn, both here and on the strategy map.  Most of the time, you'll simply want to have the AI resolve each battle for you, which it does with a great deal of fairness. A handy window shows you the play-by-play progress of the battle. You'll want to speed up the messages so fast that it's impossible to read what's going on mostly because 1) it takes forever at the slower speeds and 2) the results aren't really worth reading anyway. What's important here is that you see the morale changes for each army and who was forced to retreat.   Like any good wargame For Liberty! abstracts a few key elements in order to allow the player the chance to focus on the game's strengths. In this case, the strengths are recruitment, strategic maneuver and tactical battle resolution. Players won't have to worry about the nuts and bolts of things like supply or sea transport or training recruits. Though these concepts are crucial to the overall strategy, they're exclusively under the control of the AI. While you'll need to be aware of them and their effects, you won't need to actually tinker with anything to get them working for your benefit.  On the other hand, the game forces players to micromanage uninteresting elements that the AI could easily manage based on context. Having to set movement and attack stances for your troops is a perfect example. Units that are moving should use a moving formation and units that are within attack range of an enemy should use an attack formation. That the game forces you to set these orders yourself seems pointless. When you add in some of the less glamorous busywork that the game forces at you -- things like managing pay, shuffling leaders around, etc. -- you'll find yourself with much less time to spend building an army and figuring out what to do with it.  Which is a shame because we quite like the game's emphasis on building armies. In fact, the successes of George Washington rest less on his battlefield success and more on his ability to create an army and then sustain it through repeated losses. The American player in the American Revolution campaign faces a similar challenge. Unable to generate sufficient concentration to smash the British, the Americans have to fight a bit on the defensive, hoping to wear the British out over time.   The AI is actually quite good at capitalizing on two main elements of victory. First, it knows how to gather troops together into large enough formations to steamroller over any opposition. While it limits their mobility somewhat, it means that they push back the forces opposing them. The game definitely weights its battle resolution in favor of these large armies, so players who encounter a 15,000 man army had better just lump all their troops together before attacking. We tried having smaller groups on the flanks to support the actions of our main force but the game seems to care more about the numbers of the direct combatants, which makes support units useful only for sneaking behind the enemy to capture towns they've left undefended.  That's the other thing the AI is good at. We'd frequently march our forces out of towns to combine them into a massive enemy-stopping force, only to watch in horror as a small detachment of cavalry break off from the enemy's main formation and sidestep our forces to capture the towns in our rear. It's a bold tactic, but a fair one. Sadly, it means that players who are on the defensive will have to break up their giant armies in order to screen the enemy from outflanking them. Players who are intimidated by the AI can change some of the rules and bonuses around to weight things more in their favor.      Developers, publishers and reviewers are often too quick to excuse outdated graphics for wargames. While it's true that the wargame crowd reveres content and challenge more than cinematic visuals, using that bias as a defense of poor graphics has always seemed somewhat insincere to us. While there's nothing specifically wrong with For Liberty!'s visual presentation, it's more than the usual few generations behind the times. The individual unit and tile assets are serviceable but leave a lot to be desired. Effects are very sparse. The smoke effect from bombarding a fortified town is particularly bad. Beyond that the interface displays the information you need but feels far too cluttered as a result.  Not surprisingly, the same limitations apply to the sound. Focusing on utility rather than beauty, the sound design for the game features some well-chosen but thinly rendered period music and too light effects for the tramping of boots and the firing of muskets. The horrible trumpet fanfare that accompanies a leader's rally command had me reaching to turn off the speakers immediately.   Finally, the game did provide some genuine laughs in the form of random event messages. We're not sure who translated these but there are some real gems here. Our personal favorite is shown in the image above. Maybe it sounds a lot smoother in the original Hungarian but all it's gotten us are confusing looks and forceful slaps.For Liberty! gets a few things right. The focus on two less popular wargame settings gives it a chance to stand out from the crowd and the comprehensive nature of the campaigns means that nothing's left out of the experience. The strategic and tactical action is even enjoyable enough to support the experience and the AI provides a satisfying challenge.The problem is that there's a little too much going on here. The campaigns are large and unwieldy and there's far too much micromanagement of factors that the player shouldn't need to worry about. When combined with repetitive tactical battles and the poor visual presentation, this isn't a game that will hold your attention too long.", "date": "Apr 13, 2007"}
