Given that the two Battle Tanx games released on the Nintendo 64 were actually very good, it's an odd move on 3DO's part, but one that the company made nonetheless. Whether you think of this as the next in the Battle Tanx series or an entirely new title, the bottom line is that just as was the case with Battle Tanx, WDL: Thunder Tanks is a tank-based action game where you get to blow a lot of things up.  GameplayAs a single player game, WDL: Thunder Tanks has a lot of features, but lacks any real substance. Players can compete in a Tournament mode and various skirmish modes including Death Match, Family, Domination, Capture the Flag, and Frenzy. Plus, each mode has different levels of customization and there's a plethora of different tanks that can be used that differ in power, speed, and weapon abilities. On top that, the game offers a lot in the way of special weapons and power-ups. These power-ups, or enhancements, include very cool things like Strike-9 Homing Missiles, Nano-Walls, Guided Missiles, Artillery Strikes, Satellite Strikes and Nukes. The problem is that there's just not a lot of substance to the single player game because there's not a story mode and playing against the computer just gets really old quickly. The main reason to own this game is for its multiplayer capabilities. While the feature set is pretty much the same as the single player mode, the game's fun factor just goes through the roof when you're blowing up tanks controlled by your friends instead of the computer. The action is always fast and furious and with the wide variety of maps, tanks, multiplayer game objectives and the ability to team up with friends or just have a free-for-all, the game's multiplayer play value is almost without limit. GraphicsThe biggest complaints that were generally made about the N64 Battle Tanx games were that they didn't really look that good and that they ran at a fairly low framerate. The same things definitely cannot be said about Thunder Tanks for the PlayStation 2. The game looks remarkable and the framerate is generally nice and fast, as the game only suffers from some slowdown in extreme cases. Even in four player games with drones, the game plays rather smoothly and while there is some occasional slowdown, it never detracts from the gameplay and never becomes a problem. Beyond the solid framerate, the game also scores high in other graphical categories. The special effects in the game are quite good, as there are some excellent explosions and the lighting effects when you shoot off missiles and other weapons look great. The tanks are modeled nicely and contain some nice high-resolution textures and are fairly detailed. Additionally, the backgrounds, which are filled with destructible 3D objects that are also nicely textured and detailed, are generally pretty large in scale and have a lot of variety in design and style. The only real downer is that there's a lot of seaming problems with the ground textures and some of the wall textures. Also, the level of background details seems to take a little hit when you play the game multiplayer, as the textures don't seem quite as crisp and there's more noticeable aliasing when playing in either two-, three-, or four-player split-screen modes.   SoundNot to be overly  clichd, but the audio in Thunder Tanks is a mixture of both good and bad. The voice samples are actually quite hilarious at times and the developers have done a fabulous job of making sure that the voices are actually synched with what's going on in the game. Likewise, there's an excellent variety of sound effects used for explosions, crashes, and general tank movement, but as is the case with the voices, the quality of the sounds seem somewhat lacking. They're not really that crisp and seem to be deficient at the high end of the sound spectrum. Most players probably won't be able to tell, though, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless. After Goldeneye, there wasn't another game on the Nintendo 64 that I played with my friends as much as Battle Tanx. It was pretty worthless as a single player game for me, but it provided an endless amount of fun in three or four player gaming situations and my friends and I would break it out whenever we got tired of killing each other in Bond. I can see the same thing happening with WDL: Thunder Tanks, as it's basically a prettied up version of Battle Tanx with no real slowdown and framerate problems. Thunder Tanks is an excellent four-player game and while the single player game gets stale rather quickly, it's worth picking up if you play games a lot with your friends. It can get a little hectic and the game's multiplayer modes don't seem quite as polished as what you get with TimeSplitters and Unreal Tournament, but it's very fun nonetheless and is an good option for those who want more than just a first-person shooter.", "date": "Dec 23, 2000"}
