That's why we've unlocked our hermetically sealed vaults and dusted off some old PC classics to take a look back at the days of PC gaming yore.  Thus PC Retroview was born.   If Dune II invented the real-time strategy genre, then Command and Conquer made it popular. The combination of fast tactical action and base building became a genre in itself thanks mostly to the success of this first C&C title. Several games have made major improvements to the model over the years, but let's be honest -- developers are still copying this game. Everywhere you look across today's strategic landscape you can see the same sign: Westwood was here.  And, as we've come to expect from many of the games featured in this column, C&C has more than just dreamy eyed nostalgia going for it. You ever have that experience where you're walking through a used bookstore and come across a book that you loved as a child? And then you pick up that book thinking, ~This'll be great! It's the best book ever!~ And then you read the book and realize just how stupid you used to be for thinking it was so good? To be honest I had prepared myself for that disappointment when I went back to play the original C&C. Now I'm realizing how stupid I was to ever doubt this game would hold up.  Five years after it's initial release, the original Command and Conquer is still a great game. I'm shocked that the tactical and economic features of the game are so well integrated. The action is fast, the resource and base modeling are sound and the style of the game is totally captivating. It's rare enough that current games can get all these features right, even with five years of refinement. To think that the original team that made the game could hit it right off the mark is astounding.  The conflict between the goody two shoes Global Defense Initiative and the insidious Brotherhood of Nod sparked a range of imitators. The GDI are the good guys of the story. They have a more straightforward approach than the Nod. From a standpoint of technology and finance, they tend to invest a little more into each unit than the Nod. The Nod require slightly more finesse. Their units work in a more indirect manner than those of the GDI but are no less deadly. The great thing is that you come to identify with the approach or ideology of one of these groups. For me it was always GDI (I'm an Allies man, too, by the way). I just love law and order.  Based off the same engine as Dune II, Command and Conquer surprised us all by still looking really good. Of course, the graphics aren't up to today's standards (most anyway) but the game is extremely sharp looking. Running in a solid 800x600 resolution the units look remarkably tiny. And if you think the units are tiny, you should see the maps. Most of the maps are a quarter of the size that we're now used to. Very often you'll find a map that's only four times bigger than your monitor. We all had a good laugh over this at first, but it's still just as fun to play on a smaller map thanks to the phenomenal map design. Choke points, cliffs and rivers offer all sorts of strategic opportunities.  And the AI will take advantage of every one of them. I was happily frustrated by the challenge level of the game. I honestly hadn't expected the AI enemy to fight back as intelligently as it did. Using an array of sneak attacks, diversions and patrols, the AI plays remarkably well. Even worse, it's really good at running infantry over with tanks, something that the Red Alert 2 AI didn't stress as much. It's a little less challenging because you're playing on a much smaller map than you're used to, but if it can still frustrate and surprise me after five years, you have to give the designers credit.  We take it for granted today that a RTS game will offer some form of network or internet play. Back in 1995 however, this was a startling new feature. Command and Conquer upped the ante for all future strategy games by allowing you to go online and play against your enemies -- although most of us found it more satisfying to trounce our friends instead. Offering two player modem and four player network support, C&C was responsible for many failed exams and kept me from getting into grad school. Thanks a lot, Westwood. I've been on the servers a little bit these past two weeks and was glad to find that there are still folks out there willing to play this game online.  Westwood also raised the bar for the competition in terms of production values. The installer by itself has more personality than many games released today. Westwood also began a tradition of using top quality, cutting edge technology for the numerous cutscenes that drive the story. At the time, we had never seen anything like it. The quality of the acting seemed to drop off a bit for the rest of the series (leave it to Ray Wise and Barry Corbin to turn things around in Red Alert 2) but the sense of character and story in C&C is a big reason the game was so successful. In the game proper, the acknowledgements your units give you keep the intensity high with just the right touch of humor. Anyone who remembers the commando's ~I got a present for ya,~ knows what I'm talking about. That the soundtrack kicks your ass eight days a week is just an added bonus.  Fortunately, many of the team members who made Command and Conquer are still at Westwood improving on their initial success. Series visionary Brett Sperry was president of Westwood for a while and is now Chief Creative Officer working closely with the all of the development teams at Westwood. Joe Bostic programmed the original game and has worked on every C&C project since. Eydie Laramore also helped conceive and design the game. Eydie has since moved on to other companies but came back to help out with the mission design for Red Alert 2.  You can pick up the gold edition of this game (bundled with the Covert Ops expansion pack as well as the original Red Alert and its expansions) for twenty bucks. The nostalgia value alone would more than warrant the purchase but with C&C you're getting a game that still holds up even five years after its initial release. It won't compare favorably with the triple A titles that have come out recently (Red Alert 2, Age of Empires, Starcraft) but, to be honest, I'd rather play the original than have to face another cheap imitation.  -- Steve Butts Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Presentation  Westwood kicks every one else's ass in terms of production and the original C&C is no exception. Great movies, great story and a solid interface make it easy to enjoy the action.   8.0  Graphics  Even by today's standards this game looks good. Sure the units are tiny, but the details are very crisp. The interlaced cutscene work is still impressive.   8.0  Sound  I don't remember the soundtrack being this good. The unit voices heighten your sense of involvement in the game.   9.0  Gameplay  The game suffers in comparison to the recent improvements in interface and AI models, but even so, C&C is one of the most exciting RTS games I've played recently.   9.0  Lasting Appeal  Two sides, each with a unique set of units and a unique set of missions will keep you interested for a while. The Westwood servers aren't packed with people waiting to play, but I had no trouble finding games to join.   9.0  Should I Go Back and Play It?  Still worth any attention you can give it. Beyond the place it occupies in the history of RTS games, C&C is a great game. It even beats many of the current crop of strategy games.   YES!!!  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   8.8 The game suffers in comparison to the recent improvements in interface and AI models, but even so, C&C is one of the most exciting RTS games I've played recently. Two sides, each with a unique set of units and a unique set of missions will keep you interested for a while. The Westwood servers aren't packed with people waiting to play, but I had no trouble finding games to join.", "date": "Mar 1, 2001"}
