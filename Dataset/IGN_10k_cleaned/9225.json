Tile-swapping mania has already hit the DS in variations from zoo animals to Pokmon. Now things have gone ancient, with publisher Mumbo Jumbo's Egyptian-themed 7 Wonders of the World. The game tasks players to build the world's pyramids brick by brick, chipping out stone blocks from beneath puzzle pieces and sending them up to the workers to be placed on the foundation. This game is definitely a case of style over substance, but in the overcrowded DS puzzle marketplace that's probably not a bad approach. The core gameplay mechanic borrows from Panel de Pon (aka Tetris Attack or Pokmon Puzzle League) and Bejeweled, requiring players to line up groups of three or more pieces in order to clear them out and bring in new ones. But instead of clearing out a set number of pieces or racing a timer, the focus in this game is on chipping out stone blocks behind the pieces. The board begins with a small stone behind each piece and as combos are scored, the stones break off and are put onto a conveyer belt, lifted up to workers on the top screen to use on the current pyramid. The more bricks that are broken at once, the larger the stones are that go up. This would imply that the developers want players to get multi-combos, but unlike games like Tetris Attack, the player isn't able to move pieces around while a combo is occurring. This omission hurts the game somewhat, as it's boring to sit and wait for everything to stop moving before working on the next combo. The stone-mining idea is a nice addition though, and becomes quite a challenge in later boards where the traditional square or triangle-shaped boards are replaced with oddly-shaped ones. This can make getting those last few stones in the corners quite a challenge. Powerup pieces make an appearance anytime a combo of four or more pieces is scored. When played, these pieces will either wash out all others in a horizontal line, in a vertical one or erase specific pieces across the board. What's nice about these powerups is that they can be played anytime by the player and don't require a combo in order to set off. So if a powerup is moved downscreen by pieces underneath it vanishing, it won't be set off, but the moment the player moves the powerup with the stylus, it will.  Aaaw, the little slaves are so cute! There are also negative pieces such as immobile chunks of rock that can't be used in a combo or moved with the stylus. The only way to get rid of these pieces is to keep comboing underneath them until they drop off the bottom of the screen. A metal plate appears later in the game that must be used in several combos before it's sent away. All of these elements are well-balanced and bring some strategy to an otherwise pretty basic game. When a stone makes it up to the top screen on the conveyor belt, a worker will pick the stone up (or team up with other workers, if it's a large one) to haul it offscreen. A half-built pyramid in the distance shows the building progress. The workers are a cute addition to the classic puzzle gameplay and have a lot of personality, even if their animations are a little muddy. The number of workers present depends on how many stones the player sends up. This results in an interesting situation where the player is clearing out a lot of stones early on, requiring a lot of workers, then less and less stones as the board clears out. When workers have to wait for their stones, they'll drink water, read a newspaper and eventually strike (with little picket signs) out of frustration. While I have to question the authenticity of Egyptian workers striking because they DON'T have to build a pyramid, it is cute nonetheless. It also affects scoring; when the round is over, the player gets a bonus for every worker that's still onscreen. So if the player can keep the block-clearing fast and steady, they'll get a hefty bonus. If they let their workers strike for too long, the workers will pack their bags (literally) and walk offscreen. None of this is that essential to the core gameplay, but it helps distinguish 7 Wonders from the other DS puzzle games on the market. The only real risk in the game is a thermometer to the right of the puzzle pieces. It empties over time and if it drains before the level has been cleared, that level must be replayed. But with all the powerups and low number of unique pieces, it's pretty rare to fail a level. There are eight pyramids in the game, each made up of 6 or more boards. In addition to the main game mode, which is called Rune Quest, there's a free play mode that's unlocked after playing the first level. High scores are recorded and there's a help section with visual examples. It would have been nice to see some variations on the gameplay and shorter, more challenge-driven modes as well, but the main game is enjoyable enough to keep gamers happy for a while.Just to be clear, theres very little that 7 Wonder of the World offers thats lacking from every other DS puzzle game out there. Its a Bejeweled clone that isnt quite as polished or focused as that game. At the same time the idea of the pyramid building, while a little superfluous, is fun and the worker animations are always worth glancing up for. This isnt the one puzzle game on DS to own, but puzzle addicts looking for one more game could do worse.", "date": "Oct 12, 2007"}
