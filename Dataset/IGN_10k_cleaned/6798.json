{"name": "Blackstone Chronicles", "name_review": "Blackstone Chronicles", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/01/22/blackstone-chronicles", "text": "Don't be fooled into thinking that this game is just a rip-off of John Saul's Blackstone series. It's not. Instead what John Saul and Red Orb have done is create a new story that continues and enriches the ones in the books. In short, you don't need any knowledge of the books to get involved in the game. The game continues the conflict that was supposedly resolved in the final book and also gives the player a chance to discover a great deal about the events leading up to the start of the series. One word of warning is conspicuously missing from the promotional literature for this game-the intro of the game gives away the ending of the books right away.  The background story is well developed and intriguing. Shortly after the turn of the century, a huge American Castle a la Biltmore or Vanderbilt was converted to an insane asylum. Your father, the late Malcolm Metcalf, was the final superintendent when the place closed for good back in the 40s. About 5 years ago (when the book series begins) the late Dad had grown bitter over the closure and began taking his revenge from beyond the grave. People in Blackstone began to die at the hands of a shadowy killer. Before their death each of the victims received a gift. Each of these gifts had previously belonged to an inmate of the asylum years ago. Needless to say, by the end of the series the killer is revealed and all is well again in Blackstone . . . well, maybe not.  There has been renewed interest in the asylum recently (will they never learn?). The Blackstone Historical Society has purchased the building and plans to open it next week as a museum of psychiatry. This foolish mistake is enough to reawaken Dad's injured sense of self-worth and now he's back to his old tricks. He has kidnapped your four-year-old son, Joshua, and plans to use him as a tool of revenge by training him to be a killing machine. Being a conscientious type of father, you have come to Blackstone to rescue little Josh and finally have it out with the old man. This is the point at which the game begins.  Your job is to roam around the asylum gathering clues and objects to help you save your son and kill your father-have your analyst explain that one to you-all before sun up. The game action is pretty evenly divided between puzzle solving and conversations with the ghosts of former asylum residents. The puzzles are tricky but they can be solved with a little common sense-which might explain why it took us so long to get this review up.  Another thing you'll need is patience. Frequently you'll have to travel from one end of the asylum to the other and back again several times before you have enough information to move ahead. There's no shortcut either. Most puzzles can't be solved until you have fulfilled several prerequisites. The visual transitions are so well done that you may not mind going from the kitchen to the basement to the women's' ward to the office just to find out that the object you need was in the kitchen in the first place. I didn't either-at first.  Sooner or later, you'll come across the timed traps. These are puzzles that must be solved within a certain amount of time or you die. The game is forgiving in that it won't let you into a puzzle like this until you have the items required to escape. If you die, the game offers you three options: try it again, get a hint or receive the solution. I only had to use the hints once and that was because I was too stupid to see the obvious-you'll feel that way too. There is a definite logic to all these puzzles and by the third one you should know what triggers them.  The conversation interface doesn't allow much flexibility but more than makes up for this limitation in the depth and substance of the interaction. The inmates reveal a lot about themselves and their experiences. These are the most disturbing and chilling moments of the game. You will feel genuine sympathy for the inmates and it's this sympathy around which the horror of the game is built. On the practical side, the conversations will let you know how to proceed through the asylum. The inmates will tell you (among other things) which keys open which doors.  As in real life, you get nothing for free. You have to perform tasks for the inmates to get them to reveal their information. Apparently no one will help you out of the goodness of their heart. I mean, here you are, trying to save your son and all they can think about are their own needs. ~Yeah, I remember Dr. Metcalf taking some little kid somewhere to perform some unspeakable, horrible kind of monkey violence on him. I just can't remember where. Maybe a grilled cheese sandwich would jog my memory.~   Each of the rooms in the game is beautifully rendered and decorated. There are two or three places to stand in each room and three or four different perspectives for each. In all you get well over a hundred different screens of incredible detail. My only complaint is that there were only 20 accessible rooms. There are so few rooms I could get to in the whole place that, for a moment, I thought I really was in the Biltmore House. Also included in the rooms are touchscreens provided by the Historical Society which offer commentaries on the patients and various psychiatric treatments. I found this resource to be a lot of fun-but I like real museums too. Go figure.  While there is a definite progression to the game, the story is not entirely linear. You are free to choose from a few different lines of investigation at times. Unfortunately, when you run out of leads, all you can do is run the mouse cursor over the screens looking for something to click. For the most part I blame myself and not the game designers. It was always something really obvious that I had overlooked (isn't it always?).  The game is very cerebral and rarely relies on the manipulation puzzles found in other games. You'll need to think things through in this game but rest assured that your efforts will be rewarded. The horror in the game isn't physical either. The game relies on your sympathy with the inmates to create a real feeling of dread. Although there are some situations and objects that will disturb you, the stories of the inmates will really get you. All in all The Blackstone Chronicles is a fun and rewarding game for those with the patience to see it through. You may find yourself cutting on the lights and looking over your shoulder as you play. Oh, and be sure to check in those closets.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jan 22, 1999"}
