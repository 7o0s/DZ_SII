Every show from Iron Chef to that weird looking Italian girl with the big head is available for people who love to cook or watch other people cook. Top Chef is one of those shows where contestants compete against each other trying to make the best dishes possible. Unfortunately for fans of the show, the wireless version of Top Chef is about as shallow and unattractive as that woman with the scar on her arm.   Take out the competition part of the show and Top Chef leaves you with three mini-games and a trivia game. Creativity is once again thrown out the window, replaced by confusion, monotony and some bald guy who has a smirk on his face like he just got away with spitting in your food.    Guided by two of the shows judges, Mr. Clean and Mrs. Battle Wound, you start the game as a lowly cook who has to prove his way around a kitchen and earn the restaurant a five star rating. You do this by playing mini-games over and over and over until the restaurant has gotten its five stars and you earn the title of Top Chef. The entire game takes place inside the kitchen, and you move your character around talking to other members of the cooking staff and playing their game. Once you achieve the score goal for that game, new games unlock and you start your climb towards a five star rating. You start games by walking up to kitchen staff and engaging them in conversation.   The games are very simple and easy to play. Top Chef should take you about 1 or 2 hours to punch through when it's all said and done because there isn't much depth to the game itself. Each of the mini games are on a timer so you'll have to play them about two or three times for every stage you're on to earn enough points. Dish Mania is the Tetris type game where you group dishes by color, then wait for the same colored soap bubble to appear. Connect the bubble with dishes of the same color and they disappear off the grid. If you don't make dishes disappear fast enough, what looks like globs of dirt will fall down and can only be removed by doing what you were obviously unable to do in the first place, which is make dishes disappear. It's perhaps the most boring of the mini games.   Pans in Panic is the easiest of the mini games. You have 3 to 6 plates on the screen depending on how far along in the game you are, each of them holding food to be cooked. Cooking meters above the plates let you know when to remove the food from the plate. Basically you just sit there and wait until the number blinks and press the corresponding number on your keypad. You want to try and press it right when the pointer is the middle of the yellow bar on the cooking meter for maximum points, but that's hard to do later in the game when you're dealing with six dishes instead of three. Press the button too late and you've burned the food and that plate is no longer used in the game.   The Perfect Plate requires you memorize a plate of food then recreate what was on it. You're shown a plate of four different types of food from a tomato to a fish, and it's your job to remember what place they were in on the plate. Press left or right for Yes or No when food is shown to you on the plate. Time is ticking so hurry up and finish all the plates. It's easy to memorize the plates because the picture stays on there until you hit Ok, so you can either write down what's on there or stare at it long enough to memorize it. Miss three times and the finished plate will flash on screen to give you a hint.    Kitchen Chaos is the most confusing of the mini games and the most tedious. Each of your staff members play a part in putting the food on the plate to be delivered to the customer. It's your job to make sure they keep washing the dishes, preparing and plating the food so you can grab the plate off the conveyer belt and hand it to the waiter. Each character has a number above their heads. Press 8 to activate the dishwasher so dishes are cleaned for the line cook to put food on. 6 for the line cook, etc. It's a game that tries to come across as really strategic but all you have to do is keep pressing all of the buttons all the time and you'll do fine. The only character you need to watch is your own so you don't drop a plate and end the game, so just keep mashing away and the game will eventually end.   The hardest part of the game is the trivia section. Thankfully you don't have to pass it to continue on with the game. One of the categories is Top Chef and since I've only watched maybe two shows, I had no idea what any of the answers were. Two other categories deal with kitchen utensils and food questions. They're very difficult and you have to be a food nut to know a lot of the answers. It's clearly the only part of the game the developers put any type of time and effort into. Why not include some games where I actually have to cook something based off of recipes given or a dish I have to create from a list of ingredients?    The graphics are cartoonish and the games themselves, while plain, are very colorful. The food doesn't look like real food which is kind of funny when you're playing a game that's supposed to be about food. Instead it looks like that plastic food you would find in a toy kitchen playset.   Top Chef the Mobile Game is one dish I recommend you pass on. The games themselves are not fun and you really dont do anything that involves the actual act of cooking. You simply play some dumb mini games over and over until the bald guy tells you youre top chef. I realize wireless games are made to be quick and simple diversions, but not at the expense of creativity and some sort of challenging game play. I would have liked to have learned more about exotic dishes and maybe even gotten some recipes I could have tried out. I wanted to try and make some fancy French entree, but Top Chef stuck me with Macaroni & Cheese.", "date": "Jan 22, 2008"}
