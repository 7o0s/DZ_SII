{"name": "Rally Cross 2", "name_review": "Rally Cross 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/04/rally-cross-2", "text": "The original Rally Cross brought new elements to the fledgling rally arena that made folks look up and take notice. Gamers could roll their cars and then tip them back over. The control was a little loose and the tracks were occasionally too tight, but the game felt solid in the physics department, and the franchis's future looked bright.  Now Rally Cross 2 is upon us, amongst the hype of competitor Dreamcast's Sega Rally 2, and those still playing the absolute favorite of PSX racers, Gran Turismo (even though it's not a rally racer). Rally Cross 2 could have gone in many directions, but the developers aimed their targets at a wide river of aspects that make Rally Cross more accessible in many new ways. The sequel features a slew of new courses (24-plus), more choices in cars (20), including 4X4s, trucks, and Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs), plus a handful of little touches that add up to lots of replay value.   Idol Minds has widened its courses, and crafted its game with a gradual learning curve, rather than the amazingly annoying (but yet challenging) courses from its first effort. Still, as in the first, you must learn how to drive off-road, get your timing down, and master the power-slide to progress into the upper echelons of Rally Cross 2.   Smart features include complete analog and dual shock compatibility, a decent set of rock soundtracks, a peppering of short-cuts, the ability to tweak different components (brakes, shocks, tires, and handling among others), and the choice of going against traffic, or with it. For those who like to alter the look of their cars, you can do that, too. You can change the color of your car to anything under the sun. What's absolutely the best part of Rally Cross 2 is that you can create your own courses. In the edit mode, you can choose a free range of attributes that you can save to a Memory Card, and will bring you back to the game over and over again. It's easy to use and each course takes up very little space on your Mem Card.   Rally Cross 2 is not, however, the best rally game ever. On the PlayStation it's probably the best, but that's not saying much. Though you can change your suspension and brakes the cars are amazingly floaty, and they bounce around like indestructible power boats than rally cars. It's like each car is filled with helium.   The graphics are good and solid, and little details like muddy dirtying your car after a puddle and a highly improved AI are definite plusses. In fact, the AI is great. Also, the frame rate is consistently high, keeping the action crisp and clean.So what's wrong with it? Well, nothing really. Rally Cross 2 is one of those games that's hard to get excited about. It looks good, plays well, and doesn't do anything particularly poorly, but it's not a game to get revved up about. It's a well-honed sequel to Rally Cross, but nothing more. I like the game enough, but I'm not crazy about, and I'm a big fan of rally games, so in a way I'm disappointed. Frankly, it's a solid game, one that you're probably want to buy, but if you're looking for the super models of rally racing, it ain't no Claudia Schiffer.", "date": "Nov 4, 1998"}
