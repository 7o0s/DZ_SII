I've been looking forward to Vampire: The Masquerade for over a year now, ever since I first saw it at E3 last year, because someone had finally taken the RPG into 3D without sacrificing what makes RPGs so great. And even better, this RPG was to be in realtime, which meant that you'd have fast action, but with all the strategy and brain power of games like Baldur's Gate or the Ultima series. Unfortunately, things haven't turned out so simple, and the finished product is a grand mess, a game that for all its beauty and energy is plagued by problems which keep it from being a truly great game.  If you haven't heard about this game by now, you must have been residing in a coffin somewhere -- so we'll be nice and guide you gently to our mounds of mounds of Vampire coverage. As Christof Romuald, knight in service of the lord in the middle ages, it's your job to make sure that bad things don't happen to good people. After being wounded in battle, you end up bandaged in bondage at a Prague nunnery, under the care of a beautiful nun. Temptations being what they are, you both deal with issues of romance and lust under the rules of religion, all the while battling vicious monsters in the local area. It's only a matter of time before this sweet love tale is shattered by the fangs of a vampire mistress, and you're thrust into the ruling underworld of Vampire theocracy. The plot gets much, much more complicated from there, and is sure to please fans of RPGs, both fantasy and otherwise. The voice acting is good but not great, but the storyline is incredible and engrossing as any fantasy epic I've seen on the screen this year. Before the saga is over, you'll find yourself in different parts of the world, in two vastly different time periods. All of it is rendered in exquisite detail, with some of the best lighting effects and architecture design seen this year, hands down. I've rarely seen a game with this much attention to detail. At times it feels like you're running through a small model of a real city, and on a good day it feels like you're just plain running through a real city, period.  Like I mentioned earlier, the gameplay is a mixture of the classic RPGs you're used to, as well as the action/RPG hybrids like Diablo which focus on realtime, click-based attacks and spellcasting. Interaction with the environment, and with enemies is all down through a mouse interface, and while you can use hotkeys to access menus, nearly everything can be accomplished without touching the keyboard. As you learn disciplines (Vampiric skills) and gain access to spells, you can set them to either item hotkeys, or drag them into a discipline interface that can be triggered with a right mouse click. When you begin the game, it's a pure dream to use. See an enemy? Then click and attack to your heart's content. As you get deeper in the game however, the real problems begin to arise.  First off, even as a single player, you'll find that connecting with an enemy is a frustrating experience. While some of it is related to your experience level in relation to an enemy's, a lot of the time it's just poor collision detection that causes you to swing at pure air while an enemy feels free to attack at will. This become much more of an issue with multiple characters, however. Though the manual says that you can have your allies focus on a single enemy by holding down a specific key, rarely does this actually work in the middle of a battle -- many time, your allies will swing at empty air while you're quickly being pummeled by a villain. With two or three companions in a party, things begin to get really messy. Because the game is played out in realtime, you don't have time to switch between characters, and you certainly don't have time to take control over what spells they should use, or who they should attack, and when. While Vampire provides you with three different modes to put your character in (defensive, neutral, and offensive), they do little to keep your characters alive in the space of a normal battle. Put a character into defensive mode, and they'll simply sit in the background without aiding the party, even if the character is a discipline-heavy but weak character. You can tweak the options to stop characters from using disciplines without your direct control, but it would be nice to have them use them in a smart manner, instead of not at all. Put them on offensive, and more often then not, they'll plunge into a battle without watching their own health, killing themselves in a matter of minutes if you aren't constantly switching characters to provide maintenance.  The enemies don't help matters much, either. Most of the time, you can see them standing in wait for you to get within a certain distance, and when they do, it's usually in very, very large droves. The difficulty level fluctuates like a wave pool, giving you twenty minutes of easy battling, then slaying you instantly with one unexpected onslaught of enemies. This wouldn't be half as bad if it wasn't for the hideous save feature that forces you to replay huge chunks of a level, simply because you couldn't save in a safe place (we'll get back to the save feature in a moment). Add the bad collision detection, and poor AI to the mix, and you've got a very, very frustrating experience. You'll learn quickly to avoid putting points into disciplines, and simply focus on getting your characters as strong as possible, because of the frustrations involved with dealing with the AI of the companions and their disciplines/spells. Overall the game comes off as incredibly unbalanced, especially when you fight one of the many bosses in the game. Take Mercurio for instance, one of the first bosses. He'll kill you in a matter of about 30 seconds, time and time again, unless you've put all your experience points into strength. Use a mysterious femur to attack him with however, and he'll die with three hits. Literally. Bosses are a crapshoot, and exemplify the structure of the game, being that you'll either die in 30 seconds or destroy your enemy in about 10. Without the gut-level, simple slashing that makes Diablo so fun to play, the quick battles in Vampire can feel very unfulfilling.  Some of the main problems in the game might have been fixed by providing more control over your characters. Games like Evolva or Dark Reign 1 & 2 show just how helpful AI commands can be when controlling multiple characters. In Evolva for instance, you're able to tell characters where to move, or who to attack with a simple mouse/keyboard command. Dark Reign 1 & 2 allow you to have control over your unit's personalities -- whether to attack but conserve health, or to go all out and jump into situations with guns blazing. Just being able to have your companions in Vampire drink from enemies until they're full would have been nice, but instead you still have to pop into their bodies, just to ensure that they survive on a minute to minute basis. If the game was turn-based this would have been fine, but during the sometimes stressful battling in the many dungeons in the game, this sort of maintenance becomes near-impossible.  The game, for all its beautiful story, is very dungeon based. Usually, you'll be sent on a task to retrieve item X from dungeon Y, and the dungeon usually unfolds in the same three level structure. While each dungeon is (no surprise) gorgeous, and filled with all sorts of detail and spice, there are rarely big surprises when it comes down to actually slugging them out. While dungeon crawling isn't necessarily a bad thing, I was hoping for more of a classic RPG free form structure.  After dealing with the control issues in the game and the frustrating AI, you'll begin to realize the game's true, most fatal flaw when you fight through your first dungeon. Notice a little something missing from the options menu? That's right, there's no save feature. You can save in your haven (sort of a home base located in town), and the game auto saves when you reach the next level of an area, or a new map, but you can't save as you choose. For an RPG that's just unacceptable, especially one where a quick, painful death is lurking around every corner. And there are worse consequences, as well. My coworker Trent has been playing the game, and was working through a huge dungeon for about three hours. He loaded up the game while talking to me, and accidentally clicked ~new game~ instead of ~load game,~ and in a moment all his work was erased. The auto save replaced his previous save, and voila! Instant hair pulling. On a brighter note, the upcoming patch for the game will allow you to save anywhere, so hopefully this won't be such a big problem for those of you that haven't purchased the game yet.  The graphics and sound quality are the highest points of the game, and frankly I can barely squeak out anything to complain about. The voice acting may not stun, but it's solid, and the music is moody, rich, and reflective of the time period. You'll hear strings and horns in the past, and bumps and samples in the present, all with a high production value. As for the sound effects, they're just as nice -- deep bass, authentic details, and some great sound tricks if you've got nice speakers. I was very, very impressed by what my ears were hearing.  Last but certainly not least, there's the multiplayer element to the game. Heavily talked about, highly anticipated, Vampire's multiplay might just change everyone's criticisms of the game altogether, though at this point it's got some huge kinks to work out. The pre-made multiplayer scenarios are a bit too stiff for beginning players, but those of you who try to gain experience by playing online games with strangers may find some dangerous traps. A lot of people have been opening up games just to kill players and take their money and items -- not very nice, but that's the Internet, for you. Right now people are still trying to learn how to put together scenarios, so while it's easy to say that the multiplayer experience isn't as fleshed out as it could be, it's really up to the users to create something magical. Activision has already released a beginner's level, so it looks as if the Nihilistic is actively trying to support the online community. We'll keep you posted as to how multiplayer progresses.  Marlon Brando had it right -- they coulda been a contender. Instead, we've got a reason to look forward to Nihilistic's next big thing. Vampire has plenty of moments of pure brilliance, and with some of the patching promised in the coming weeks, the gameplay is already looking up. But overall the game just doesn't provide you with the quick action fun of Diablo, or the in-depth entertainment of Baldur's Gate. It's definitely a hybrid, but a hybrid that doesn't quite succeed on either level.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Jun 17, 2000"}
