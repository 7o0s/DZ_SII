I honestly doubt that Disney's Magical Quest was on that many of them...but hey, Nintendo and Capcom fill that gap for whoever really wanted it. The thing is, though, the original game wasn't that special to begin with, so whatever niche it's filling is sort of lost on us...it was most likely only ported and released to capitalize on the GameCube Disney Magical Mirror title (or is it the other way around?).  The funny thing is, as average as this GBA platformer is, it's still a much more welcome design than the 3D title released on the console. Features Two playable characters Link cable support (single cartridge) Cartridge save (one slot) Game Boy Advance to GameCube support Only for Game Boy Advance  As mentioned above, Disney's Magical Quest is a conversion of the Capcom platformer released on the Super NES...the game puts players in the role of Mickey (or Minnie, a GBA exclusive feature) as he sets out to get Pluto back from the evil Emperor Pete. Mickey will have to bounce through a short six level platform adventure (separated into three or four sublevels, some with mini-bosses)...he can bounce on enemies heads and pluck blocks and other items out of mid-air to toss at the bad guys. Later levels let Mickey wear helpful costumes: a wizard's outfit gives Mickey the ability to fire magic bolts out of his fingertips; a fireman costume lets Mickey fire water out of a high-pressure hose; the climbing gear turns Mickey into Bionic Commando as he can latch onto platforms with a hook. Players can change outfits on the fly using the shoulder buttons, but generally speaking there isn't a whole lot of opportunity to continously switch between costumes within a specific situation.  It's just difficult to ignore that the game design in Disney's Magical Quest is just so...ho-hum. There are a few clever elements like the firehose to spray blocks in specific directions, or the Bionic Commando-esque elements with the climbing hook...but the fun just isn't there. And that's kind of disappointing when other IGN editors come over to watch the action with that ~I remember this game, it was great!~ attitudes...and that feeling never happens when playing through this version's levels. These GBA platform challeges aren't very unique and they don't really push the GBA hardware very hard. The port from console to GBA also affects some layouts, since the screen cuts off the view area...making for some annoying ~leaps of faith~ encounters that shouldn't be there.  And it's obvious to us that the developers realized the relative emptiness of the main quest, because the porting team went in and added Minnie Mouse as a playable character just to throw in a bit of variety. That wasn't nearly enough, though, so the team created four mini-games for single player and link cable...and as cool and welcome as it is that these games don't require an additional cartridge for the multiplayer (it's download-link supported), the game designs themselves are rather dull and horribly thought-out. Each game is based upon Mickey's special abilities in the main platform design...so, in the Climbing levels, for examples, players race to the top of a super-high vertical climb. Unfortunately, the game actually waits for both players to get to the top before deciding on the winner (which is always the first to the top), so better players have to sit and wait for the slower one. And worse, both players have to turn off their systems if they want to try a different mini-game. Now that's tedious.  It's hard to believe it, but this game is Nintendo's first ~average~ Game Boy Advance title...normally games published as first-party titles get the royal gameplay treatment, but this one definitely isn't a glowing gem in the system's library. Even the connection to the GameCube isn't enough of a selling point. The quest is definitely tolerable and somewhat decent of a diversion, it's not going to give you even an entire day of enjoyment.", "date": "Aug 20, 2002"}
