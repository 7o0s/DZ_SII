{"name": "Gravity Blast", "name_review": "Gravity Blast Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/06/gravity-blast-review", "text": "Hudson Entertainment, the mobile maker behind the caveman Bonk series, logs in with a new sci-fi puzzle game disguised as a action title. Humanity hangs by a thread as aliens threaten our very existence. Resource depletion leaves our defenses helpless. Mercifully, a new technology called the gravity drive is perfected, granting pilots the power to harness the pull of nearby cosmic bodies to propel their ships.   Gravity Blast sends you across the cosmos in a ship propelled by this new gravity drive. By holding down the OK button, your ship is pulled toward large bodies. This one-touch play mechanic is actually quite clever. At first, you'll pilot the ship wildly, bucking around the heavens like you're riding a greased pig. But after about ten stages, you really get the hang of when to engage the drive and when to just let normal gravity and inertia do the work.   The stages, enclosed by some laser barrier, are often full of objects you must touch and obstacles that need to be avoided. For example, you'll need to swoop around and pick up floating astronauts or hit switches. Fighting aliens requires you to use the gravity drive to slam into their spaceship hulls. Things you must avoid include mines and asteroids. Each stage is timed, so you don't necessarily have that long to tinker with new objects -- you must keep learning on the fly. Should your timer zero out and end the game, you can always restart from the last stage completed.  Gravity Blast is built on a smart premise: Use one-button to switch between using gravity and relying on inertia. The learning period in Gravity Drive may keep some players at a distance. Finishing a stage by simple fortune isn't exactly the most rewarding way to play. But if you can hang in there, Gravity Blast is a solid little game.", "date": "Sep 6, 2007"}
