Goofy, Minnie, Donald and other classic Disney characters are all here and ready to play in any of six different game modes with up to four people. Grab your golf bag, don your favorite pair of tacky pants and get ready to hit the links.   The game's big draw is obviously its Disney license. Some of the greatest animated characters ever are here, and that's likely enough to get quite a few people interested. Mickey will even show you around each hole, give you a few pointers, and generally let you know how you're doing. The game features six game types, eight characters to choose from, and six courses to take them on.   Gameplay  Disney Golf includes pretty much all of the standard golf modes that you'd expect. There's a driving contest, a near pin contest, and a Challenge mode. The types of play include Stroke, Match, Skins and Combination, and you can play most of the modes with up to four players.   The Challenge mode is where you'll be able to unlock a few courses and the extra characters. You start out by choosing one of the available characters and work your way through a series of challenges. You'll have four challenges to select from on each level, and three must be completed before you move to the next. A challenge might be something like playing Daisy in a skins match, or competing with Goofy in a driving contest.   One of the game's unique points is its use of power-ups. The game includes over 60 of these, which can do anything from affect the weather to your swing. Some are useable on yourself, while others are aimed at impairing someone else's game. During the course of normal play, you'll earn coins that you can use at the shop to buy power-ups. Your player has an energy meter to keep you from abusing the power-ups, though. For example, if you use one of the power-ups to affect your stroke, it might take a nice chunk out of your energy and you might not be able to use something else for a while.   Power-ups are a major part of the driving distance game. Before each swing, you'll see a quickly rotating list of the available power-ups. Pressing the button will select one and affect your stroke in the appropriate manner for that swing.    The suggested aim meter that the game gives you is sometimes way off. It will occasionally point directly into a water hazard, and it's pretty bad at suggesting how you should chip and putt. It's fairly easy to line up a nice shot, but the shots the game suggests for you explains the occasionally questionable actions by the computer controlled players.    One thing that makes the game a bit too boring is the fact that it's entirely too easy to hit a nice shot. It's not exactly simple to always hit the ball at full power, but it is simple to always hit the ball straight. During my first round of 18 holes, I only managed to hit two or three imperfect shots and wound up finishing the round at nine strokes under par. It's entirely possible that anyone who practices up a bit could average better than one stroke under per hole, and possibly wind up finishing at 20 under or thereabouts.   Putting isn't as smooth as it should be, though it still isn't overly difficult. When you first line up on the green, you'll see the standard wireframe overlay on the green to show you the hills and surrounding lie of the hole. You'll also see a preview of sorts in how the ball is expected to roll, although the game lines you up directly at the hole and doesn't take the green's hills into consideration. All of this is pretty standard, but it just doesn't end up working when you need to adjust the angle of your shot. The wireframe overlay disappears while your player is turning, and although it appears again when you stop, it makes it hard to tell exactly how far you're adjusting your shot angle.    It's also usually hard to set up an ideal camera angle while putting, so aiming properly for long shots can be especially difficult. The original putting preview disappears if you move more than a couple degrees, so you'll be guessing how your shot will work after that. There's a power-up that you can use to have the game draw you another putt preview, but if you're out of energy or didn't obtain it to begin with, you're somewhat out of luck.   As imperfect as the putting game is, it's still not likely to affect your score in any sort of a negative fashion. It's still fairly easy to sink the ball within two putts on any green, and given how easy it is to get your ball from the tee to the green, you'll still be making birdies in no time. Nice putts will just help nab you a few eagles from time to time. One thing that's a little odd is that you're not allowed any gimmies, unlike most golf games. It doesn't really matter, though, since putts from that distance are simple and you'd probably have to try to miss.   The game's ball physics are unrealistic enough that even those who don't normally play golf will probably take notice rather quickly. The most noticeable problem is that balls don't roll correctly, or in fact, they barely roll at all. During a tee-off, practically the only distance gained after the ball touches down is however far it bounces. The same holds true for anywhere else on the course. The rough stops the ball dead in its tracks, much more than it should. Even when chipping onto the green the ball won't roll more than an inch or so. The only time you'll see the ball roll more than a few inches is when you're actually putting or the ball lands on the side of a very steep hill.   As easy as the game is with the normal characters, the game includes Morty who's defined as an ~Easy~ character. He's easy since you don't need to worry about accuracy while playing as him. Simply hit the ball as hard as you can, and it'll go straight. While Morty is obviously aimed at the small kids in the house, he's just too easy to play with off the fairway. Any small child that needed him to enjoy the game will run into major problems while putting the ball or even chipping onto the green, so he doesn't really help much. It's a sad thing, the way some developers think of children while designing games. Children are not imbeciles, and they're fully capable of pressing one button a few times. Does the game really need to dumb down one of the characters this much?    With all that having been said, it's worth that there's nothing entirely wrong with Disney Golf; it's just not a whole lot of fun. The game is easy enough that it becomes boring rather fast, and most of the physics problems are ignorable once you get to used the fact that it's just how the game plays. The problem is that there's just not a whole lot here to like about it aside from the Disney license.   One thing that this game needed was better use of the Disney license. It has a handful of lovable characters, sure, but had the game's courses been based on areas from various Disney movies, this game could have ended up being something special. Instead, we're left with some rather drab courses, and we can only imagine how it might have been to play golf in the Queen of Hearts' kingdom, or maybe along the beaches of Never Never Land. Sigh...   Graphics  The game has somewhat of a cartoon look about it, but characters and whatnot are still 3D, and they look it. Although all of the characters match their cell-drawn counterparts reasonably well, you still can't help but wish that the game had made use of cell shading. The characters likely would have matched the original characters that we all know and love much better, and it would have given the game a much nicer overall look. As it stands, though, the character modeling is fairly well done.    The same can't be said for the characters' animation. Some of it is passable, like a few of their tee approaches and shot reactions, but none of it comes close to bringing out their individual personalities as well as the real thing. The animations are also very repetitive. You'll see the same reactions after every shot, and after a couple holes you'll likely have seen everything there is to see. The cutscenes that are shown before each of the Challenge mode games are especially bad. The lip-syncing is atrocious, and the scenes look pretty terrible overall.    Texturing work throughout the game is about as basic as humanly possible. The Disney characters don't need much in the way of detailed texturing, since they're supposed to look cartoonish anyway, but the courses and outlying foliage could really have made use of a better texture set. The grass looks very blotchy up close, and there doesn't even seem to have been an attempt to make it look like actual grass, real or cartoon. The sand, water and other ground types look just as bland. The foliage around the courses also reaches the same level of utter mediocrity.    Sound  Most of the characters sound like they should for the most part, but they rarely have anything interesting to say. Most of the written dialog is pretty bad, and sometimes even approaches being nonsensical during a few of the cutscenes. Mickey provides an overview of each course, but his descriptions usually only entail him saying something like, ~This hole curves to the right.~ Thanks, Mickey.   The game has a few nice tunes in it, though they can get a bit repetitive after a while. The rest of the game's sound effects are about as basic as necessary. They're not entirely realistic, though they work how they should. There's not a whole lot of sound needed for a golf game, so there's not much to expect. The sound mix could have used a nice set of environmental effects, like birds, waterfalls and the like, but the soundtrack covers that bit decently.  Disney Golf is an average, arcadey golf game with Disney characters. That may be enough for some people, and if that's what they're after, they may enjoy this game quite a bit. The problem here though is that it doesn't take full use of its Disney license, and it's an average golf game at best. Most everyone should find this game too easy to hold their interest for long, or even provide much fun as a multiplayer game. There are other games on the market that provide a much more fun golf experience, though this is the only game in town with Disney characters.", "date": "Dec 9, 2002"}
