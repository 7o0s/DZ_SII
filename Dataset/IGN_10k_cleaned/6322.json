However, the 3D game is only part of EA's plan to bring the patented ~Madden Experience~ to mobile. Only a small handful of handsets support 3D anyway, so EA commissioned a regular 2D edition of the game for the majority of mobile gamers out there. And like a pinky mixed with the index and pointer fingers, the results are a shocker. It's a lot more fun -- and a more accurate -- football experience.   Now, let's not get too far ahead of ourselves here. Madden NFL 2006 is still not the best mobile footballer available, but the improvements to control and game play options, certainly propel it into contention. The game uses a full NFL license, so all of the teams are indeed squished within your handset. Uniforms and team colors are also accurate, which means something to ardent football fans. And the name of the active player is displayed beneath his sprite. So, at least you can see TO in action here.   Play options now include a Quick Game which just picks two teams for an immediate challenge. Play Now sets up a match between your choice of teams, allowing you to view team stats before selecting your squad. And there is a Season mode which lets you take the team of your choice through the entire Season, en route to the championship. From Season, you can view game results and team standings.   In my opin, Madden NFL 2006's biggest improvement is the controls. A working instruction screen is a huge bonus, but just the general layout makes a lot more sense. When on offense, receivers are now mapped to the keys along the bottom of the phone and simply pressing the associated button delivers the bomb. I wish there was more notice to the player when a receiver is at a disadvantage, because even though this is the smallest screen, in the middle of a big play, there's a lot to keep your eyes on.   Madden NFL 2006 includes a good-sized playbook that is fairly easy to navigate through. The icons for receivers on offensive plays are big enough to quickly follow. Defensive plays are also easy to read, but EA Mobile really should take a look at how JAMDAT assembles its playbook. It's just so user-friendly.   The overhead camera view puts Madden NFL 2006 more in tune with the other 2D footballers on handsets. It's easier to see the action from this angle, rather than the three-quarters view of Madden NFL 2006 3D. When the ball changes sides, the camera blows sky high and flips around for a nice moment of disorientation. Things like this aren't necessary for cellphone games, especially when you need to recalibrate your peepers quickly to locate your players.   Madden NFL 2006 looks similar to other mobile footballers on an LG VX7000. The player sprites are somewhat small, but that's necessary to squeeze all of the action on the screen. The audio is quite good, with whistles and grunts and slams. There is commentary from both Al Michaels and John Madden, which teeters between merely informative to downright silly. Case in point, my QB was sacked and Madden squealed, ~He made a quarterback pancake!~  Madden NFL 2006 in 2D is a definite improvement over the previous 3D edition reviewed here. It's not the season champ, but the much more playable edition certainly catapults it into the running for second place. I think this is a good building block for EA Mobile to use for next year's edition, and they should have no qualms with checking out what works with other games in the category -- JAMDAT's playbook, THQ Wireless' ticker -- and consider incorporating said features. If you still haven't bought a mobile football game, Madden NFL 2006 in 2D is a good pick, but not the best.", "date": "Nov 10, 2005"}
