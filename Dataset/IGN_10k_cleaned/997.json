That's what strikes out this baseball hurler. The game would have been fair in the early 8-bit gaming days, but Triple Play 2001 simply can't hang in the same leagues with Nintendo's Ken Griffey Jr. or Acclaim's All-Star Baseball. Features:  32 teams including all from the MLB  Players from the MLBPA  Password save  Only for Game Boy Color    If you're looking for EA's vanguard Triple Play series on the Game Boy Color, look elsewhere than THQ's version. The developer Handheld Games made an arcade-style baseball game out of the award-winning Triple Play EA game, and even then its rookie baseball status (there hasn't been a Triple Play on the Game Boy Color before this) shows in the simplistic and technically inferior gameplay seen here. For beginners just looking for a playable baseball game with their favorite players in it, it will do, but don't expect the major-league gameplay.  The heart of any baseball game is the pitcher/batter face-off, but already Triple Play 2001 is looking to be benched. Only three pitches are available -- Slow Ball, Fast Ball, and Curve Ball. Even then, the pitches are only variations of each other. The fast ball isn't very fast, the slow ball isn't much of a change-up, and the amount of curve can vary wildly on either fast or slow throw. Batters have control over pop-ups or grounders, even in bunts -- why would anybody choose to pop up a bunt? It's a clean interface, and even EA's PlayStation pitcher/batter game isn't quite as involved as the competition in 989's touch-pitching or Acclaim's ultra-difficult game, but the overly-simplistic nature here is far too basic.  And, as the killer for any bad baseball game is usually in a botched fielding game, Triple Play runs up against that green monster. For one, there is no Green Monster. While real stadiums are represented graphically in the front end, the actual fields are all the same. But that's just a bobble in the fielding errors in the game. Even though a useless player icon is put on the screen to somehow help track down a fly ball, it's near impossible to figure out where your fielder is in relation to the ball until both are on the screen. Even when you can figure it out, the game is so choppy and slow that play is rarely fun.  Base running control is also wonky. Sometimes when you're controlling a base runner, you key in the base he's running to; other times, you key in the base that he's already at. It's always confusing, and managing more than a single base runner is impossible for zealous players, since often the wrong base runner will move, setting off a chain reaction of errors as you try madly to get that player out of trouble without getting the others off their bags. Worse, when a pop fly goes up, the runner control shuts off so players can't make the mistake of missing a tag-up chance -- keen for beginners, but advanced players will find the lack of control maddening, watching scoring chances just blow by. The AI and gameplay is terrible on its own -- opponents will sometimes not go for a ball dropping five feet from them -- but the big problem is slow, slow gameplay. The ball tracks across the field at the speed of a pill bug, and ball players truck so slowly that I actually had a steal go bad even after the pitcher threw a slow ball -- and I took off while the batter was still stepping up to the plate.  The graphics are sharp, so long as you only play with dark blue teams. Any other team, and the color contrast of all-red or orange players is very bland. Real players are represented solely by their name, and the stadiums are equally generic. Even the special animations are washed-out, and the game just has no life (although the crowd graphics are nice.) And when the game is looking sharp, the slow play and helpless graphic indicators make gameplay joyless. A lumbering and overly simple adaptation of EA's superb slugger, Triple Play 2001 is a trip back to the minors. Even Ken Griffy's simplistic and rushed gameplay knocks Triple Play's softballs out of the park, and nothing in this game reaches the professional levels of Acclaim's efforts. Choppy graphics, impracticable fielding, lax AI, no link play...  Four balls, take your base.", "date": "Jun 8, 2000"}
