Developed out of Austin, Texas, the series has over the years successfully mixed simulation gameplay mechanics, from a downright tough to master batting system to the usage of the full MLB license for real teams, players and statistics, with a dedicated attention to detail. The next-generation updates, starting with All-Star Baseball 2002 have grown considerably more beautiful than previous versions, with more robust player models, more animations, more clearly defined fields and stadiums, and more.   The latest version, All-Star Baseball 2003 for GameCube, is by far the best sequel to the franchise yet. It's been polished up brilliantly and now not only plays much tighter, but more closely looks and sounds like the real sport it mimics. It once again makes full use of the MLB license for all teams, players and stadiums, and even includes a new Franchise Mode (in addition to an Expansion one) that is sure to set hardcore baseball fans into a perpetual state of drooling. But sadly, the game is not quite without flaws -- there are again some AI glitches and Nintendo's limited Memory Card 59 size has made a deep impact on the save features of the Franchise and Expansion modes.

Acclaim Austin has once again capitalized on the full MLB license for real teams, players, stadiums and everything in between, which is a must and indeed a standard for titles of this sort. But there are additions above and beyond the call of duty for the hardcore audience to enjoy, including nine classic stadiums and 10 expansion stadiums and a Cooperstown Hall of Fame team. This is all welcomed, but the real meat and potatoes -- other than the play itself, anyway, comes via the different modes and options available. There are 10 modes of play, including Exhibition -- standard game, Season, Career, Home Run Derby, Series, Manager, and Practice. There are even baseball cards to collect, which is a superb extra for extending replay value.     By far ASB's best new additions, though, and the two that make the title stand out this year above the others are Franchise Mode and Expansion Mode. Franchise mode tracks statistics accurately over 20 seasons. It's one thing to survive a single season, but handling minor league players, making trades, and balancing your franchise budget is a whole other ballgame. This is the best baseball Franchise Mode on any console to date.   As the season progresses, other teams will be very active, trading players and signing free agents. There are tons of GM moves, helping to keep a lot of teams in contention. Gamers can only play 162 seasons, unfortunately, but can simulate games to avoid having to play all 162 to complete a season. Injuries are about as common as in the big leagues and the severity of ailments range from minor ankle sprains to season-ending injuries.  The end of the season brings about a plethora of awards. Gold Gloves, Silver Sluggers, MVP, Cy Young awards and more are included. We've always despised games without seasonal awards. And ASB has them all, which is satisfying. Especially when one manages to win a few. ASB will actually track the number of awards members of a player's team have won over the franchise's history. Very nicely done.    ASB 2003 on GCN   The problem with the Franchise and Expansion modes, which we might add is an annoyance exclusive to the GameCube version, is that they both require a whole lot of data blocks to save. At least 51 to start and more than three times if one hopes to have any chance of saving mid-season. In other words, the Memory Card 59 becomes useless. That's a ridiculous oversight, both by Acclaim for choosing to ignore the tiny size of Nintendo's Memory Card 59 and by Nintendo for making these miniscule memory cards the standard in the first place. Gamers who can't afford a better memory card, namely Interact's 16X version (which will do the trick with lots of data left over), these two great additional modes become downright pointless. That, dear readers, is most unfortunate. However, all remains well in the baseball universe for everyone who can afford the upgrade.  With that, the control mechanics are as tight as they have always been. The batting system is incredibly tough to master, especially against a human player who has enough brains to throw the ball where one doesn't expect it to go. A bat graphic inside the pitch box shows a hitter's sweet spot and, for a split second before the ball is thrown, where the pitcher intends it to go. Once the pitch is in motion, though, it's up to the batter to try and guess where it's headed and nail it out of the park. A button swings and B switches to a power-hit -- the sweet spot is smaller, but if one manages to line their bat up with a coming ball they have a much greater chance of ripping it apart. The system works flawlessly, quite perfectly offering gamers a real sense of how difficult it is to hit out a ball in the big leagues. When one connects with a pitch, they really feel as if they have accomplished something, it's very satisfying, and if that's not rewarding game design we don't know what is. In our opinion, this is the best hitting / pitching system of any game available on the market.     Running and fielding is equally simplistic. Acclaim's got the title setup so that it automatically assists players in the field, but we highly recommend turning this feature to manual -- it just offers a better degree of control, which we prefer. Running the bases is as simple as pressing left or right on the trigger buttons, and the same to return, tag up and try again. Our play experiences have been for the most part very positive in the running and fielding departments, but we have noticed some glitches in AI several times too. The outfielders have a habit of over-throwing the ball to the first baseman too often to be shrugged off as simple errors, for example -- and particularly annoying when the ball glides off to the sidelines leaving the opposition an extra five seconds to run the bases. This might be considered nit picking by some as it happens rare, but indeed it has happened and therefore should be a consideration to the potential buyer.  Still, with everything said and done, we quite enjoy All-Star Baseball 2003. Our late nights playing it while screaming and laughing at one another's fortunes and misfortunes should be proof enough to anybody interested in the product that it's something special. And for sure, its positives far outweigh its negatives, potential memory issues and all.  Graphics When All-Star Baseball debuted for Nintendo 64 so many years ago, it was considered a beautiful baseball game. Since then, the visuals have improved greatly and this year's GameCube title is, once more, very pretty indeed. At the core of the impressive visual display are highly detailed player models with the real scanned faces of athletes; they look like the real deal, in many cases. Helping sell the experience, Acclaim has motion-captured just about every single possible type of movement present in baseball today. Batters walk menacingly to the plate, fix themselves into position using real batting stances, and swing at the ball with a ferocious vengeance made possible through fluid, ultra-realistic animation. When a pitcher pegs somebody in the head, the batter will even throw down his hit stick and charge the wild-eyed bugger -- usually before being ejected from the game, another detail Acclaim has thankfully added. There are real-time shadows, dirt particle effects and much, much more, and this is all just part of the batter's immediate area.  Swing, batter, batter, batter...  The fields are just as gorgeous, amazing in sheer scope as they stretch into the distance. Colors are well created to mimic the shades of real stadiums, with bright grass and dark closed-in areas. Batters follow the ball and make silky smooth diving catches, one-handed grabs, and so forth. Perhaps best of all to the long-time ASB watcher, though, is that the animation transitions themselves finally work without flaw so when a fielder catches a ball, turns around and throws it to third base, there are no gaps in the animation process -- it's all one beautiful seamless thing. This, some will remember, was one of the biggest graphical problems in previous games and it's refreshing to see that it has been addressed.   The camera highlights the action from multiple angles around the stadium for a truly television-esque cinematic feeling. Instant replays, which kick into action after every major play but can be bypassed, are particularly well done. At some points, the replay goes into a slow-motion view and zooms in on the batter as he hits a ball out and it looks quite brilliant. Acclaim's attention to detail has even extended to the sidelines, where team mascots jump about and try to get the animated crowd excited. It all comes together quite triumphantly.  So what gripes do we have with the visuals? The front-end is -- quite simply, poor. Its generic design, lacking detail and seemingly created by a college student with a little free time, does not mingle well with the otherwise superior graphic work. But at least it loads fast, which is something. Other than that, all we can really complain about are some of the textures themselves. The backgrounds in some fields are blurry and noticeably out of shape, the crowds decidedly 2D in execution. These are in the end all minor drawbacks, however.  Sound In the past, the listening experience with these titles just about dropped us into a deep sleep. But for perhaps the first time ever, the All-Star Baseball franchise has come to bat with some compelling audio offerings. The ambience, the atmosphere of baseball, from the cheery organ music to the over-animated crowds, is all packed in the game this time around. And the three-man commentary is lively and delicious, if a little repetitive at points. All in all, a nicely done job -- we're not sure who Acclaim hired in the sound department, but guys, keep them.I like baseball games and All-Star Baseball 2003 is my favorite of any. The simulation take on the sport is well done with an unequaled hitting / pitching system, tight fielding and running controls and lots of great modes to explore, the most ambitious of which are the Franchise and Expansion ones. These two modes alone will keep hardcore players busy for months, if not years. The only problem is that anybody wishing to spend that much time with the game had better throw away their Memory Card 59 -- it's useless, and get the much bigger Interact X16 one, which I can recommend as reliable. The graphic and -- for once, audio portions of the game, meanwhile, are both fairly outstanding.A great baseball game with a few minor shortcomings. Every fan of America's favorite pastime should buy this one immediately.", "date": "Mar 8, 2002"}
