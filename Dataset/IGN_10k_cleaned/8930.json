But until the day that Hydro Thunder 2 bows on store shelves, fans of the splashy racer might find some thrills in the I-play published Wave Blazer.   Wave Blazer is a fully 3D racer that employs a solid sense of speed as you tear through some nicely constructed tracks. Whether you're busting through the arctic, zipping through city canals, or cutting across outback tributaries, you will be impressed by excellent 3D work, color use, and detail.   As you race against a pack of very aggressive AI-controlled boats, you must seek out boost tokens. The red token offer 10 seconds of speed boosts; these are often placed out in the open. The blue tokens give you 15 seconds of speed boost, but these often require a little risk-taking, such as aiming for a ramp or trying a secret shortcut. In fact, many of the tracks have branching routes, so if you are having trouble beating the competition, explore a little. You might stumble on a pretty cool route that shaves off a few precious seconds.   As you push through the game's grand prix you unlock new boats with different designs, paint job, and ratings like speed and weight. Your first speedboat is no slouch, but it is indeed outclassed by the competition, so you definitely need to put in some practice in the straightforward arcade mode. Wave Blazer also includes a Time Attack for ghost racing, running heats against other accomplished track times.   My enjoyment of Wave Blazer was dampened by two things -- control and difficulty, and I suspect that these issues are actually intertwined. Nobody expects a boat racer to steer like, say, Fast and the Furious. However, I expect some degree of forgiveness so you can get past the third race without gritting your teeth and wanting the last 30 minutes of your life back. Polarbit's AI is also merciless, making things so damn hard from the get-go that I'm afraid anybody but the most hardcore will be turned off.  If you like a challenge, Wave Blazer has plenty to spare. This is a tough game that will ultimately frustrate anybody but the most dedicated gamer that enjoys hovering over their phone until they master the controls. It's too bad the game's difficulty and controls are so off-putting, because there is so much otherwise to recommend, such as the great visuals and plentiful content. I'd love to see a Wave Blazer that catered to the wider mobile audience with some slightly forgiving controls and AI.", "date": "Aug 21, 2007"}
