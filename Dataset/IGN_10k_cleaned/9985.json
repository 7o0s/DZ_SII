This isn't news to you if you've been watching American Idol for the last 27 years it has been on TV, but it still took me by surprise when I rocked Tiny Dancer to the point that Randy was standing and clapping while Paula rested her head on her hands like a young Donny Osmond fan and Simon still had nothing good to say.   My pitch was only good in the middle. I sounded like I belonged in a talent show. He wouldn't pay to see me perform.   Who didn't hug this man as a child?!   Yes, if the reruns, new season and Fox's insistence on running the show 14 times a week wasn't enough to scratch your itch for mediocre singing, Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol has arrived to let your stumblin', bumblin' vocal talents take center stage in one of the KR franchise's best outings yet.     If the Karaoke Revolution games of the past have passed you by, getting a handle on the gameplay is simple enough. Encore has 40 songs such as Come Sail Away and Copacabana packed onto its disc and challenges you with singing them for points and praise from the judges. See, each time you choose a song, the words and syllables begin scrolling across the screen with pitch and timing bars above them. You sing the words and try to keep the arrow that reacts to your voice gliding over the on-screen lines. Keeping the arrow in the proper place means messing with the octave you're singing in and holding notes for certain amounts of time. Confused, 50-year-old Idol fan looking to pick this up as a way to connect with your gaming kin? It'll be second nature once you get the mic in your hand.   Once you get the basics of how to sing and adjust your performance, there are a couple of caveats you need to get down. First up is phrases. When you're playing, you'll find the song broken up by vertical white lines -- these sections are phrases. When you hit a white line, the game will score the phase you just sang with a written descriptor ranging from lousy to great. You can track how you're doing on a given phrase by watching the Phrase meter on the left side of the screen fill and change color. If you can get a ~good~ or ~great~ rating on three phrases in a row, you'll start a combo and get bonus points for every phrase you nail from there on out. On the right is a crowd meter that lets you know how you're doing with the fans. Nail the sparkly lines of text and you'll get a crowd boost.   In the end, all these boosts, phrases and points are tallied for a final score that breaks down how many goods and poors you've received as well as ranking the performance.   Find your anthem. Okay. Enough boring stuff. I know the dedicated Karaoke Revolution fans probably just rolled their eyes at the last few paragraphs, but I have to bring the new folks up to speed, y'know? Anyway, if you've stuck it out this far, you're in luck. Encore is a truly impressive game, and it's thanks to the wealth of options on this disc.   What sets this apart from the average Karaoke Revolution game is -- duh -- the American Idol license. Although this isn't the first time Fox's peanut butter has gotten into Konami's chocolate, the experience is by no means stale. When you boot up the game, you basically have the option of jumping into an American Idol competition or just singing your little heart out.   If you go the route of the show, you'll find the formula that's made the program a pop culture icon. You'll choose your character, audition for the judges, go to Hollywood and compete in a handful of rounds as you try to work your way down to being the last crooner standing. After each of your performances -- you're not subjected to watching the other singers -- Randy, Paula and Simon break you down or build you up, you're given a score, and if it's an elimination show, the contestants are listed, rated and cut while Seacrest's disembodied voice intros the next round.   Now, we all know the limitations of the PS2 when it comes to graphics and storage, but Encore does a pretty impressive job of making you feel like you're a part of the show. The judges are all voiced by their real-life counterparts and appear to have a healthy vault of dialogue to pull from (they'll even mention if you sucked at the beginning and pulled it out in the middle), there's a hefty set of animations for your character to use while leaving it all on the stage, and there are camera cuts between you and the panel while you're rated. When you're watching the performances and listening to Randy, it's almost like you're watching the real deal.    A nice addition to the mode is the ability to choose the amount of time you feel like putting in. Sure, you can save after every performance and walk away at will, but the game also allows you to choose do a Quickplay -- which is just one song with the judges judging at the end -- or choose between eight-, 13- and 18-round single-player competitions. Want a full Idol contest with up to seven friends? Encore's got you covered -- Multiplayer Contest let you and your friends square off against each other and the computer in one to seven rounds of a full-fledged show.    Outside of the American Idol show parts, you can jump right into a song and go for the high score in Quickplay, Karaoke lets you sing without having to worry about points or timing bars, and One/Two Mic Party modes open the game up with little co-op/competitive variations such as medley modes head-to-head and alternate phrase sing-offs.   Now, I can't stress this enough: buy/borrow an EyeToy when you first get this game. Like many of the Karaoke Revolution games before it, Encore features a character creation mode where you can make your singer athletic, skinny or curvy; choose from about 10 faces; and fool with hair options, but the inclusion of Cameo Head makes the game about 20 times better.     Using the EyeToy, Cameo Head records you moving the EyeToy around your skull and then has you mark some key points on the snapshots. The game compresses the data into a custom head you can put on your created character. I did this expecting my character to look goofy -- I captured my face with my mouth open as if in mid scream -- and I was not disappointed. Seeing myself in a pinstripe suit, spiked hair, screaming In The Air Tonight while leaping around the stage and Simon shaking his head at my antics was awesome. The absurdity of my character glowing as he hit a perfect combo and jamming an air guitar made the quest to become the next American Idol that much more entertaining, and I can't recommend the feature enough.    If you keep the EyeToy plugged in after capturing your striking features, certain stages will showcase the live feed from your living room on the monitors behind your rock show. When you're done singing, the Extras option contains high scores, tracks your unlock progress, showcases your trophies and stores all of the videos -- most of them are clips of singers from the show or messed up auditions -- you've been awarded.    So what holds Encore back from being the greatest karaoke videogame ever? To begin with, the graphics are weak sauce in this game. Models are blocky, the mouths of the judges move like robots, and the colors are all a bit painful. To offset the problems, the game throws in some over the top touches -- crazy stage moves and glowing characters spring to mind -- that end up working with the fun vibe  but it only works so well.   As much as this game makes you feel like you're in the real competition by using the real judges, camera cuts and the Idol presentation you'd expect, it fails at conveying that feeling all the time. After you're done getting judged, you're taken to a static screen where a list of names is cut down to show who gets to move onto the next round. C'mon -- I don't even get the chance to stand on stage with my opponents and watch them sulk off in disgust? Lame.   Exploding man! Worse is the half-assed attempt to add Ryan Seacrest to the mix. Love him or hate him, Seacrest is a pretty big part of Idol. Rather than create a model for Seacrest, his voice is just piped in over the eliminations and set switches. That wouldn't be so bad, but the sound clips are literally ripped from the TV broadcasts. He didn't come in to record these clips. That means one part of a phrase will have thunderous applause in the background while the clip immediately following will have a dead crowd behind it. I've seen this tactic used before  it was in the Deal or No Deal plug and play game.   Oh, and the audition stage is pretty much the exact same as the one found in last year's Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol. Nice production value.With Karaoke Revolution Presents American Idol Encore releasing on the PS2, Wii and Xbox 360 at the same time, I'm honestly shocked to be here telling you that this is the definitive version of the title. Singing is as fun as ever, there are a ton of multiplayer options, the extras are worthwhile and the single-player options are robust and enjoyable. Yeah, it isn't the prettiest game in the world and little things make it clear you're not really living the American Idol experience of clawing your way to the top, but this is an experience that any closet crooner can feel justified in picking up.", "date": "Feb 7, 2008"}
