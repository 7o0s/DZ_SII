The technical limitations of handsets have reduced many entries in the category to ~stop and pop~ experiences, and not the pleasing kind you find in Gears of War. Mobile ~stop and pop,~ found even in DChoc' previous Mafia Wars installments, is where you actually have to stop moving to fire at an enemy, leaving you woefully exposed to AI-controlled bad guys with no such hindrances.    According to Digital Chocolate, finding a solution for this problem was tantamount to creating the third Mafia Wars game. Safe to say, they've nailed it. Your outcast Yakuza soldier has auto-fire, but it's activated only when enemies are within his cone of vision. And even better, once you've locked on to an enemy, you keep firing until it drops. The key to survival is movement. You keep firing as you circle enemies -- your torso turns independently of your legs, but it cannot twist inhumanly. This allows you to pull off strafing maneuvers you'd normally find in console action games -- and the game is designed around it. It's pure action, with bodies dropping and pachinko machines exploding; there are not supposed to be many quiet moments.   I expect this solution to be adopted by other mobile makers getting into the isometric action genre. And in many ways, I hope they do, because it stands to really put the lid on the complaints about mobile action games -- most of them quite legit.   Yakuza also addresses one of the chief problems with the first two Mafia Wars: level size. Digital Chocolate really sliced up the levels, creating smaller scenarios so there isn't much down time between gun battles. It's great for pacing and keeps this adventure moving along. The environments are also quite destructible, which is a carry-over from War Hero 1944, one of Digital Chocolate's previous action games that was based on the Mafia Wars engine.   Yakuza's storyline is also a strong point, which is part of a growing movement in mobile: Better writing. Yesterday, I reviewed Glu's Stranded, which spins a great yarn. Yakuza tells the story of a murdered oyabun (Yakuza family boss) and the vengeance of his adopted son. The plot ends without much surprise, but it's still a very good story that is tightly woven within the game -- no long periods of exposition.   Naturally, revenge is dispensed with bullets -- but your soldier also has a sword he can use for close-in Kill Bill-style attacks and special magic fireballs for group attacks. (Honestly, I could have done without the magic. The story and action is over-the-top, sure, but the addition of fantasy elements broke a bit of the spell. Maybe a grenade instead?) When you get in the middle of a huge fight and the walls are sprayed with hot lead, the game reaches a level of visceral excitement that I do not believe has a parallel in mobile right now. Things get thisclose to out-of-control... especially in the Tower of Destiny.   The Tower of Destiny is the second part of the Yakuza package -- a room-by-room theatre of destruction. Remember those dungeons you had to plow through in Onimusha to earn huge soul counts and get weapons? That's the Tower of Destiny. You keep moving up the tower, eliminating floor after floor of bad guys -- and if you manage to beat the Tower, no worries. DChoc is going to be uploading new levels on a regular basis. But there's even more to the Tower of Destiny for American audiences: If you join an online clan with friends, you pool points earned for defeating Tower floors. You can compares clan scores on a leaderboard. This represents an enormous value.   Yakuza looks great -- and I've got the screens here to prove it. The environments are detailed, the character sprites are large, and the game employs some cool effects. Even when the screen was full of Yazuka troops trying to blow me away, the game never chugged.  Digital Chocolate has truly outdone themselves with Mafia Wars Yakuza -- it's simply the best action game available for mobile. I'm not handing this score out lightly; Yakuza earns every bit of it with an incredible new control dynamic that changes the way I'll look at other action games from here on out. And this new control scheme is helped by phenomenal pacing and scenario construction. This game cooks. Toss in a great story, good graphics, boss fights, as well as the Tower of Destiny challenge, and you have can't miss gaming at an excellent price.", "date": "Nov 10, 2006"}
