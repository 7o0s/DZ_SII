Trendy new card games, Japanese obsessions and unexplainable new fashions come and go before some people learn about them. I'm talking about everything, from games to TV, to fashion to toys. We live in a fast-paced era of constant alteration.   It's strange then that Wallace and Gromit in Project Zoo, BAM Entertainment's low-profile platformer is coming out. Among many of the game's subtle themes is the paradoxical nature of humans and their relation with technology. Wallace, the middle-aged Englishman who most desires only to have a good chunk of cheese with his companion while reading the newspaper, also fiddles around with machines, creating rockets that fly to the moon and robotic mechs designed to eat breakfast easier.    Yes, it's wonderfully perplexing that a stop-motion animation boasting an now-ancient technique provides insights into these themes, and what's more that Wallace and Gromit has become a videogame on a 128-bit system and re-creates that very technique with modest success. So it's strange wonder that BAM's Wallace and Gromit is a traditional platformer with a few successful twists. What's especially important is that the game is true to its origin, even if the technology and development behind the game is lacking.     Gameplay  A traditional platform game filled with the elements of collection and exploration, Wallace and Gromit follows the travails of the balding, middle-aged bachelor, Wallace, and his smarter than the average pet dog, Gromit. Based on the original trio of claymation shorts developed by Oscar-winning creator Nick Park, BAM's game applies the quiet genius of Wallace and Gromit's universe to the age-old platform formula with a few tricks.   Gamers control Gromit, the dog, but numerous progression points in the game require Wallace, the human, to fix something to enable the pair to move on. Using a single button, players control Gromit (by default) and call up Wallace, who then traverses over ledge and ladder to meet Gromit where he's standing. If there is a device needing fixing, Wallace will automatically go to it. It's by this method that the game gives us its unique twist -- which is both a blessing and a curse.     When it works, about 95% of the time, this mechanic is functional and fun. When it doesn't work, well, it's the cause of much frustration. The levels are designed for Wallace, whether by climbing, walking or even taking an elevator, to get from any one device to another. But oftentimes I found that he gets stuck or doesn't do what he's supposed to. Sometimes, he gets hooked on an object, while other times he is, for instance, at the bottom of a river and completely unable to move, but clearly able to talk and breath. Other times he just doesn't do what he's supposed to do. Curious? Yes. Annoying? Yes. A sign that the game still needs polishing and testing? A big yes.     Perhaps my reviewable disc still had 1% work left on it, and so those little glitches have been fixed; perhaps not. But both the reveiwable versions of the GameCube and Xbox had similar problems. Either way, there are other indications that the game is still rough in its final form. Examples abound, though they're not all that big taken on their own. The culmination of collision detection issues, poor camera mechanics, clunky framerates, and several very frustratingly designed levels make me believe that this game needed more attention, polish and fine-tuning before coming to market.    Oftentimes the camera gets hung up inside small rooms, preventing the player from being able to control Gromit to the right spot. And the camera is very swingy -- meaning that whether Gromit is controlling the banana gun, or if he's just moving to and fro, the camera zips from side to side, up and down rapidly. This is the first time in a long while that a game caused me to get motion sickness, and it was definitely because of the camera. Also, it makes me wonder who this game is aimed at. Some parts were actually not just frustrating, but difficult. So, is this for kids or adults?    Those things said, the universe of Wallace and Gromit is generally well applied to the videogame medium. The story follows the bumbling pair as they once again butt heads with Feathers McGraw, the devious, cold and calculating penguin who uses methods equally astonishing as Wallace's own, only evil, to get things done. In their plight to capture Feathers, the duo find themselves freeing beavers, elephants and other creatures from cages, and plodding through numerous environments from forests to caves and the like. Gromit can hang from ledges, swim, walk, run, perform stealth sneaks, high jump, back flips, and use weapons (albeit goofy, non-killing ones) such as a Porridge Gun, Coal Flinger, Banana Launcher, Turnip Gun and Springy Boots. Players will find themselves roaming through six locations, including 23 missions and seven bonus levels. Peppered throughout the game are tough-but-fun bonus levels, and items unlocking film clips from The Wrong Trousers and Cracking Contraptions.   Although the aim of the game is indeed to collect as many various coins, tools and items as possible, it is creatively designed, and despite its problems it feels fresh. The kooky inventions, the way the two work together, the quiet nature of the game, the way it doesn't try to be cool and hip -- I like all that. There are no big over-the-top explosions trying to fool you into liking it more than you should. And it's totally non-violent, giving it a big thumbs-up for parents who're looking out for their kids.    What's more, it's designed around the same goofball ideas so prevalent in the animation shorts, giving it a feeling of authenticity. Any fan of the shorts who likes games will love this game (well, anyone who likes the shorts AND who likes platform games will probably like this game). The game content is the same on each of the platforms -- PS2, GameCube and Xbox -- so there are no differences gameplay-wise.     Graphics  Using standard polygons and textures, realtime lighting, and relatively big levels to create the world of Wallace and Gromit, developer Frontier (RollerCoaster Tycoon [on consoles], Darkxide, Infestation, and V2000) has done a decent job of making us feel like we're in the claymation world of the weird duo. Given that the original animation shorts are based on simple, stop-motion techniques, the game, in turn, looks equally simple and charming. It looks true to the shorts. The framerates range on the various systems, but they all generally remain, or at least try to remain, at 30 FPS. The PS2 version is guiltiest of straying to lower levels.   The GameCube looks the best, followed closely by the Xbox version, and lastly in a distant third place is the PS2 version. The GameCube and Xbox versions offer crisp looking textures, relatively clean lines and a little bit of shimmering, but not enough to be alarmed. The PS2 version is muddy looking, with less visibility, few clean textures, and generally the worst framerate. Players can switch the game to widescreen on any of the versions.   On a slightly different topic, the lighting and shadow work are generally good in all three versions, especially the realtime lighting mine levels. The camera, on the other hand, often clips through objects and isn't as smooth and maneuverable as one would wish. In fact, the camera is the most frustrating thing about the game. It hangs on objects, in long doorways, and flips too quickly during platform-style events. Also, there are times when the camera reaches a fixed position. Rarely is it needed or desired, instead just creating frustration instead.    Sound  Frontier didn't go nuts when it came to sound effects and music. There are some unique touches, such as echoing caves and funny sound effects, and the voice-overs from all of the original actors are all in here. Naturally, this lends an unmeasured-able amount of authenticity to the characters, and so yes, it's just like the short animations this way.    The music is also unusually good. Derived from the shorts, it blends a humorous movie-like soundtrack with orchestral pacing, sounds and an emotive feeling that's perfect for the clumsy pair. The options menu reveals no support of any kind of Dolby anything.Frontier has done an excellent job of creating a platformer that's authentic and true to the world of Wallace and Gromit, but it's done a rather shoddy job at creating a good platformer. Based on the classic 3D formula set out by Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Wallace and Gromit adds a few touches of ingenuity here and there, but falters in several departments, whether it's technical or tuning, camera problems or irregular and poor framerates (though I guess framerates aren't technically a department). Wallace and Gromit is a good thing for kids and die-hard Wallace and Gromit fans. It's non-violent, it's funny for both kids and adults, and if players end up being casual rather than anal about the little stuff, this game will provide a long platform experience.  For hardcore platform fans, definitely rent this first -- or skip it altogether.", "date": "Oct 7, 2003"}
