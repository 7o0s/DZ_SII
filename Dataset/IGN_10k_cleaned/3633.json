When PSMOnline saw and played the game about three months ago, the game 'felt' better,  complemented by an excellent camera angle, and a decent sense of speed. The final version we got our hands on today is not the game we had hoped it would be. In a few words, Jeremy McGrath Super Cross '98 is a decent game that disappoints in many ways.  First of all, few motorcycle games ever provide the same kind of feel that a (car) driving game does, with a few exceptions. Moto Racer for the PC is one of those games. Super Cross '98 is not. But Super Cross '98 performs well in many respects, as in the level design and in bike differentiation. The Arizona level in particular was frustrating in all of the right ways: filled with bumps, hay bales, and a good mix of straight-aways and sharp turns, the game forces you to learn the skills or quit. I admit, this one is fun and challenging.  Initially, in the Season mode, you're offered two bikes, and as you progress, more appear for selection. These two bikes range from slower but better in handling (smaller engine), to faster and requiring more driving skills (bigger engine). If you simply want to race through one course, that's selectable too in Single Race mode, and it enables gamers to see what kind of course selection they'll come up against when they improve.   Another set of reasons to be glad about the game is its Track Editor and the two-player mode. The track editor, while usually a good idea, is extremely clumsy, and makes you really work to just put a track together. It's possible to create them, and there is a decent amount of selection (jumps, wide roads, hairpin turns, etc.) but with the totally unintuitive and piece-by-piece set up, gamers are going to be hard-pressed to make any at all. Least of all have fun making them. The two-player mode is decent as well and at least provides gamers with what they want -- head-to-head competition. Unfortunately, the graphics and shifting textures fall to pieces, and the frame rate drops substantially. What you get is a glitchy, hard-to-handle two-player mode that'll make you wonder why you put out the money in the first place.  The game's biggest disappointment is its failure to provide a smooth, fast, consistent feel and appearance. Graphically, Super Cross '98 looks like a first-generation game. What should be solid, stationary textures instead shift all across the terrain. The lack of a high frame rate, which is meant to help to create a smooth-looking, fluidly animated game, assists in creating  game that flickers like a strobe light, and is as choppy as the high sea.   Oh, and let me not forget the sound. Musically the game is par for the course. In the farmland, you get a light-hearted country soundtrack, and in others it's a hard-rocking guitar-grinding sound that fits perfectly. But what the hell is wrong with those bikes? Crank out your engine and the bike sounds like a single-stroke underwater lawn mower, cutting up sea slugs, or even worse, a blender with rocks in it. It's pathetic. Acclaim probably hid the engine sounds from Jeremy McGrath before he signed on the dotted line.   But it's the feel of speed that really disappoints. And that will keep me from playing this game ever again. Despite the high-powered engines on these bikes, you will feel neither their power nor their speed, and instead you'll feel like a jammed up bumper car in an over-crowded ring. The difference between tearing up dirt and asphalt courses are nil, and the jumps -- another bummer -- don't provide that radical dirt biking should. Sure, it's not a sim, but hey, I'd rather play Jeremy McGrath's Super Snail Race than this slow, unfun misery.  It's true though, you can pull off tricks on your bike, and you can spin out, occasionally. So, what would it take to make this game better? A better sense of speed and acceleration, a less awkward camera angle, and more focus on the details, like being able to feel different terrain, for starters. Probe is a great developer, but this game certainly doesn't portray the company in its best light. If you're desperate for motorcycle racing games, rent this one. Electronic Arts' Moto Racer 2 has he potential to be a much better game -- and you can see and feel it at every turn.  Douglass Perry", "date": "Jun 23, 1998"}
