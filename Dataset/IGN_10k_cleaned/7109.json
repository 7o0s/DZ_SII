The original quarter-muncher is still among the greatest two-dimensional fighters around, eclipsed only by Capcom's other entries into the genre, such as the Marvel Super Heroes and Street Fighter Alpha franchises.Those titles corrected many of the balance issues with the original Street Fighter II, as there used to be several exploits and a few overly powerful characters. We're looking at you Blanka, you giant hurt ball, you. Still, no other fighting game in history evokes the quarter-stacking nostalgia that SFII does, and now we finally get to play it on XBLA and over Xbox Live.The addition of a training mode, some basic 360 achievements and online play make this one of the finest SFII ports to hit consoles, and for a budget price of only 800 Microsoft Points, or about $10. And with online leader boards over Xbox Live, this game was bound to cause a few sick days as we all fight our way up the virtual rankings. Unfortunately, less-than-stellar online performance and the finicky 360 controller keep SFIIHF from being the must-have XBLA title we thought it would be.Oh snap. SFIIHF features the original eight World Warriors, and the playable bosses from the Champion Edition: Balrog, Vega, Sagat and M. Bison. And while the game has been sped up from the original -- hence the Hyper Fighting -- we were hoping to see a slider that would let us adjust the game speed to even faster levels. In addition to the basic Arcade, Versus and Training modes is online, what we had hoped would be the main selling-point of the game.There are ranked and unranked matches, but the unranked lobbies are a bit barren, since most gamers are excited to prove that those hours of cutting school 14 years ago were worth something. One highlight of the unranked match is the quarter match, where you wait in line to take on the winner of a four player group. While you're waiting, you can observe the other fighters duking it out, which is a nice, nostalgic touch harkening back to the ~I got next,~ days of old.Ranked matched feature quick, custom and create-a match, although quick match has not yet worked for us. In about 30 tries, each match that we attempted to boot up timed out. At this point, quick match is broken. Instead, you'll have to create your own match.Right when you boot up your first match, your tongue wagging in excitement, you'll be disappointed with some problematic lag issues. The animations are a half-second behind the controls, in almost every match we've played, and we don't exactly have slow gaming connections at the IGN office. Usually, they're blazing. The lag has been so bad at times that when you go for a jump kick, your character will hit the ground before even starting the kick animation. You can adjust to some extent, but for hard-core players, of which we have no shortage here at the IGN office, the delay is unacceptable. We only say this because we love the game and play for several hours every week on an arcade console here. The stat-tracking is nice, the rankings are addictive and awesome, but with even a hiccup of delay, old-school World Warriors will be disappointed.Blanka is still a little cheater. Adding to the frustrating controls is the Xbox 360 controller itself. While smooth and slick and often wireless, the finicky D-pad leaves a lot to be desired. Sometimes you'll feel you're playing Prey, where up is down and down is up. The SNES D-pad this is not. The analog stick isn't bad, but it's no arcade stick, that's for sure. Of course, none of this is Capcom's fault, and a third-party controller would handle the fighting action just fine. When we find the Dead or Alive controller that's hiding somewhere in the office, we'll let you know how it handles the dragon punch.When we heard that SFIIHF was coming to XBLA, we were all excited to try it out on our HD sets. Sadly, the game features the same visuals from years ago, with no HD upgrade to mention. At least Capcom kept in the drunken iron worker Zangief's home stage. You do have the option of stretching the game into widescreen, at least. The sound is also vintage SFII.For 800 Microsoft Points, this game is a good purchase and a great addition to the XBLA library. We hope Capcom speeds up the online play so that the controls are as tight and responsive as the offline game. At this point, however, that is not the case, and hardcore SFII fans will have to decide if moving up the online rankings outweighs the unresponsive online controls. Still, even without a next-gen audio or video upgrade, Street Fighter remains as fun as ever and continues to stand the test of time, reminding us why we fell in love with the game in the first place. And yes, Blanka is still cheap.", "date": "Aug 3, 2006"}
