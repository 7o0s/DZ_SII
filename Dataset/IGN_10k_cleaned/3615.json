There are still cars to race and bizarre courses to go through, but aside from the obvious wackiness there is such a drought of finishing touches and other creativity to make this remotely interesting. In moving to a new console this series should've innovated instead gone with a halfway finished facelift. Scrounge around for this title only if you want to play with the tiny cars, but fear the eternal embarrassment should anyone catch you at it.   The idea of the game remains exactly the same: when the humans are away the cars will set up racetracks and play. The tracks are set up in laboratories, desktops, kitchens, gardens, monster factories, you name it. The sides of the tracks are lined with pebbles or gumdrops or whatever else is handy, but there's no problem going outside of them, just not for too long. After all, that helps to set up players for the wacky fun-filled experience of hitting hard-to-see objects and coming to a dead stop.    Combining the top-down view with some cluttered 3D environments makes for some difficult racing in Micro Machines. There are many bridges and plants and other items that can partially or completely cover the course at various points. This fact gets even stickier with the game's method of showing all of the racers on one screen, meaning that the leader can see only a couple of inches (remember, these are tiny cars) of track ahead. It's a technique that was cute and functional in a 2D land, but is looking quite awful here. In an effort to make up for this, the developers made the tracks very straightforward and boring. Winning can often be a true test of willpower of who wants to play the game the longest.   There are power-ups that can be used to even out the competition and they add a bit of extra action, but not enough to lift the game up. The advantages that the attacks give are pretty minimal, often making the effort to swerve out of the way to pick up some new weapon not worth it. They're a cute effort, but this game needs much, much more than that.   There are a couple of modes that change the camera position and provide something approaching real entertainment. The Micro GP mode is set up on longer courses with a countdown clock and checkpoints that add more time. Unfortunately, this helps to show that the car speeds that look zippy in the top-down view are really pretty lethargic. It's as if everything had been slowed down and the only benefit is seeing all of the environments up close.   The other mode in this view is Bomb Tag. This is a hot potato game where one car has the bomb and can only pass it on by hitting another car. When the time's out somebody goes boom. Here the weapons are more exciting because they can stun an opponent to pass a bomb onto them or stun a bomb carrier for a getaway. But the worlds are filled with objects that block the way and slow the action down. And some of these objects don't look so imposing. Who knew that a dollar bill had the stopping power of a brick?Micro Machines is a classic case study in how older games don't translate cleanly into a different format. The idea of racing cars around a cartoony blown-up world can work. Making the camera the biggest enemy in the whole game doesn't work at all. Unless this one is on sale for just a couple dollars, don't bother.", "date": "Apr 22, 2003"}
