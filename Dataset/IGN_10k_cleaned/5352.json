{"name": "EverQuest II", "name_review": "EverQuest 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/29/everquest-2", "text": "I'll spare you the usual spiel about how EverQuest launched a craze for massively multiplayer games, how it set a pattern which nearly everyone has tried to copy, and how it became, under the name ~EverCrack,~ the poster child for game addiction. We're here to talk about the sequel and the improvements and changes it's made to that initial model which has since launched dozens and dozens of less-successful imitators.  Interestingly, the new game incorporates many of the improvements that other MMO games have made in the five years since EverQuest was originally released. Many of these new ideas make EverQuest 2 a stronger game but still one that most MMO fans will find very familiar. That's no surprise; time was when profits from a successful game were used to underwrite riskier projects. These days it's hard to imagine Sony looking at the half-a-million fans of EverQuest and thinking, ~Let's try something different next time around.~ While EverQuest 2 is surely one of the most impressive MMOs you can play, it's strengths are more refined than revolutionary.  Once all 7GB of the game are on your hard drive and you've created your account, you're ready to take up your new life in the world of Norrath. A lot has changed since the first game but veterans will find themselves in familiar territory just the same. The game relies on the traditional fantasy types -- elves and dwarves, warriors and wizards -- with a few new additions to spice things up a bit. The catlike Vah Shir of the previous game have now been replaced with the also catlike Kerrans. Following the traditional cartoon enmities, it was a short conceptual leap to the inclusion of the ratlike Ratonga. (Watch for a dog race in the first expansion; I hope they call them the Dogonga.) The Frogloks are a tempting choice in the character creation screen but they're not yet playable. Presumably a game event will unlock them at a later date.   There are no racial class restrictions now, so your choice of race might be dictated by the initial ability scores and racial bonuses available but, since these differences aren't terribly important past the first few levels, you're more likely to select your race based on their appearance and temperament. You'll find a wide variety of appearance options for your character, from the angle of the eyebrows to the width of the jaw but at the risk of seeming insensitive I have to admit that the members of a given race all look alike to me. Add to that the similarity in class-related accouterments and you'll find it's nearly impossible to distinguish one gnome mage from another.  After a brief tutorial section (which you can skip if you know anything at all about video games), you'll be deposited on the Isle of Refuge, a sort of pre-school for adventurers. There are plenty of threats to contend with here but this island serves as an easy introduction to the game's core concepts. Here you'll choose a basic archetype (priest, mage, fighter, or scout) that influences the rest of your character's life. The Isle gives you a nice introduction to quests, combat, crafting and grouping before sending you out into the wide, wicked world.  Once you're ready to move out of the starter zone, you'll have to declare for good for evil. (A few races are stuck with one or the other choice.) If you decide to be good, you'll start in Qeynos. If you opt to be evil, you'll be shipped off to Freeport. This business about two starting cities is kind of a mixed bag. On the positive side, it allows for much more detailed starting zones for all players. The cities of Freeport and Qeynos are enormous and full of all types of people and buildings. You'll still find the odd room with nothing in it and no real reason for existing but there's a real sense of credibility and urban sprawl in the numerous zones that comprise each starting location.  Only having two starting areas means that the entire game world can be designed so that there's a consistent increase in the challenge level as you move away from the starting zones. A lot of low and mid-level content can be crammed into fewer areas now, meaning there's more opportunity to design expansive, high-level zones. You'll find that the areas immediately outside your starting areas are convenient for leveling up till level 20 or so. In any case, the areas just beyond these initial hunting grounds are much too dangerous for characters that aren't already in the high-teens level-wise. Even then, you'll need a strong group to make it out alive.      The downside is that there are no more racial starting locations. One of the coolest things about playing the original EverQuest was making the journey to find the homes of other races. This was basically free content for the developers, as you provided your own rationale for making these long journeys. The new game awards experience for discovering new areas, so it does make some design sense to prevent players from traipsing all across the land, racking up levels just for sightseeing. Still, since all the gnomes, barbarians, elves, and so forth start in the same two places, that motivation to explore has to be generated some other way. This also means that racial identities are pretty much non-existent and, since you're only playing with other good or evil characters, there's not much to separate your character's background or outlook from anyone else's.   Though I've never much gone for the player-versus-player experience, the absence of any PVP action here is just stupid, particularly so since the two starting cities are so far apart in terms of geography and morality. It seems as if the developers are setting you up for a conflict that they never intend to deliver. The whole point of good and evil is that they're in opposition to each other but, apart from slight differences in terms of the atmosphere of the starting cities, the game doesn't care that one player is good and another is evil. Why set players and starting cities up in opposition if you're not going to do anything with it later?  The only way players can compete against each other is through the guild system. Guilds can gain prestige and renown by acquiring and fulfilling guild writs. The competition between guilds seems a bit indirect but, since this is geared more towards high level players, we assume that the system will be put into practice on a larger scale in the coming months.   In our initial impressions, we criticized the rather generic character of the starting classes. I get the point about progressive character building and I have to admit I felt quite a sense of accomplishment moving from the rather generic ~mage~ to the more specialized ~sorcerer.~ Still, since there's not much variety at the lower levels, it's pretty hard to feel like your character is an individual. Having different races in the same city definitely does help but in terms of abilities, the characters are just too similar to each other before they reach level 10.  After that you'll not only be able to choose from a more specialized class, you'll also be able to start upgrading your own sets of skills and abilities. Your new abilities are obtained automatically as a result of leveling up, but you can buy books that offer upgraded versions of these abilities from NPC merchants or PC crafters. The NPCs can only offer a slight upgrade. For the good stuff, you'll have to rely on other players or rare monster drops. I think it's lame that the monsters don't drop upgrades according to your class. Sure it increases player interaction but it also increases my irritation.  The class specializations seem very well balanced at this point. No one class seems to dominate encounters, either singly or in groups. In fact, there are some fantastic group and solo-oriented tactics available to all classes. Rogues can sneak and launch devastating surprise attacks, while mages can pin their enemies in place and fire off nukes and spells that deal damage over time. When you decide to specialize as a bard or warlock, you'll have a pretty good idea of what you like about the character classes and how they can make themselves useful in combination with the other classes.  Kudos to EverQuest 2 for finally putting that great manufacturing conglomerate AFK out of business. Crafting is a bit more like combat now; opportunities come up and you'll have to react to the crafting process in real-time by performing key actions. Failure could lead to items of poor quality or catastrophic accidents that actually might kill your character. The crafting profession is like the other character classes now. It has its own experience bar and levels and even has its own character classes. As with the core classes, you can even specialize, opting to become a potion-brewing scholar or a skirt-sewing outfitter. Further specializations lie further down the crafter path. Since many of the raw materials are located in dangerous places, most successful crafters will have to supplement their skills with some real adventuring talent.      Sooner or later, everyone's going to run into some kind of combat. EverQuest 2 still follows the click-and-watch mechanic that's become the standard for the genre, but it adds a wide range of special abilities that you'll have to trigger at key points in the combat. This makes fighting much more interactive than it was in the previous game. And with the new options to search for groups of players to band together with, you'll find that many of these moves become more useful when paired with those from other classes.  Evaluating the potential threat of monsters is much easier now. The con color appears over their heads now by default, so you can see which monsters are more dangerous at a glance. The name will also be outlined in red if the monster is automatically aggressive towards you. This makes it easy to steer clear of encounters you'd rather avoid. Since the encounters are locked once you start attacking, you can't always rely on the kindness of passing strangers to get you out of tough situations. (There is a ~call for help~ action that unlocks the encounter.) You'll also see which monsters are grouped together and will attack in force if disturbed.  There's a single power bar now for special moves and magic spells. This means that fighters will have to pause to refresh their abilities along with the spellcasters. Thankfully the regeneration of power and health is very quick in EverQuest 2, assuming you've managed to keep yourself well fed and supplied with drink. You'll rarely have to wait more than a minute or so to get all your health and power back, even at higher levels. Buffs also last a lot longer this time around so you won't have to keep reactivating them every five minutes. You can let some of these babies run for a full 12 hours before you need to start them again. Unfortunately you can't buff anyone who's not in your group now so their effectiveness is a little more limited.   The Heroic Opportunity system is interesting in practice, but it seems like it's much more reliable when used in solo encounters. Basically, certain attacks can trigger special chains of attacks that, when completed, unleash more damage or improve player stats. The problem is that every time I've tried to use it as part of a group, we've rarely gotten past the second action in the chain before someone wrecked it for us. Part of the problem may be that certain abilities take a while to cycle. If you're already gearing up for one type of attack once the heroic opportunity wheel points your way, it's almost impossible to step back and fall in line. It definitely does allow solo players the chance to take on bigger risks but, in my own experience, it's much less reliable when fighting as a group.  I quite like the way death is handled in EverQuest 2. (For the record, I hate the way it's handled in the real world. Talk about harsh.) Instead of appearing at your last bind point completely nekkid, dead characters in EverQuest 2 can choose to reappear at a point near where they died. Their items will have degraded a bit but you can repair them very cheaply. The character will also have incurred an experience debt that it must pay off before accumulating new experience. If you can follow the glowing trail back to the scene of your death and collect the spirit shard that's there, you'll drastically reduce the experience penalties.  In the original EverQuest quests were something you picked up now and then to break the monotony of stomping whatever monsters happened to run across your path. Quests are a much, much, much bigger deal in EverQuest 2. There are tons of quests here (at least for those under 20th level) and you'll rarely step outside without a clear idea of what you should be doing next. That's not to say that EverQuest 2 is a linear game; the sheer variety and number of the quests mean you're still in charge of your own experience.  Though some monster drops can lead to unique quests, most quests are obtained through talking to NPCs. Thankfully you're no longer required to sort out the bizarre keywords for yourself. This time around each of the conversations include response bubbles you can choose from to lead the conversation in the right direction. A lot of effort has obviously gone into the conversations but, after you've heard your hundredth sob story, you're likely to just start clicking through these without caring much about the content. Your business is adventuring, after all, and you can't waste your time listening to the masses, most of who seem to be plagued by either indolence or relationship problems. ~Go propose to my girlfriend for me,~ or ~Pick up a beer recipe at that tavern across the street~ are popular examples. Amidst all this errand running, you'll also be tasked with killing lots and lots of monsters and ~criminals.~      If you're on a quest to collect items from defeating monsters, you'll find EverQuest 2 is pretty streamlined. Not only do you not have to physically loot monsters to recover the quests items, the quest items don't even take up any space in your already limited inventory. This is a real boon and something that should be automated in every MMO.  There are some downsides to the quest system, though. For one thing, there are a lot of quests that require you to run back to the quest giver to complete them. While it may make perfect sense in terms of the story, it just seems like so much busywork, particularly in cases where you're just running messages back and forth. As a way of easing the burden, once you've completed the citizenship quests you'll be able to teleport back to your starting city whenever you need to. (There are also docks and griffin stations to transport you across vast distances.) Another pain in the shoreside asp is that you can't share quests in a group. Get a good six people together for a night of adventuring and you'll see how obnoxious this can be.  The quest journal, though undeniably handy, could definitely use some improvements. First on our list of aggravations, the journal doesn't sort quests in terms of the goal's location. You can easily sort them by where you picked them up but, honestly, this information is almost completely useless. If I have to go kill a certain number of creatures or deliver a message, I really don't give a ratonga's ass where the quest originated from; what I need is a list of all the quests that can be completed in my current zone. For multi-part quests, it would be much better if a given quest moved from one folder to another in the journal based on what you had to do next.   And though you can have one quest open in the upper corner of the screen, it would be peachy if I could get a progress update on each quest as I perform the various tasks. Something like ~orc 3 of 15 killed.~ A big, fancy ~task complete, return to so-and-so at such-and-such place for reward~ would be helpful too. In the absence of these features I found myself actually writing down the quests by zone alongside the notes I took to write the review. God help you if you try to maximize your questing by filling all 50 of your quest slots.  Though some of my issues with the game are design decisions, Sony does have a few bugs to squash as well. Some things, like the game telling you you've obtained a quest item when you actually haven't or NPCs saying ~east~ when the text reads ~west,~ are easy to forgive. Others, like monsters that are invisible to some members of your party but not to others, verge on being deal breakers for me. To be fair this invisible monster problem isn't too frequent, but the few times it's happened to me have really caused a bit of aggravation. The dynamic instancing of certain zones is another great feature, but it hasn't completely eliminated the camping that sometimes frustrates your hunting.  And now for the graphics. Here's an area where EverQuest 2 really shines, sometimes quite literally. If you like the photorealistic style, you simply can't do better than EverQuest 2 in terms of graphics. You can see all sorts of details on even the most mundane of objects. Armored helmets have realistic looking rivets on them, skeleton warriors have individual ribs, and the folds in cloth are realistically shadowed. You will see some clipping here and there but given the achievements in terms of lighting and water effects, a little clipping here and there isn't that big a deal.  The animations are great as well. I love the way the NPCs wave you over when they have a quest to give. Casting animations are also great and characters wave their hands around in the air as they cast spells. The combat animations are the best of all. Though the swings and thrusts don't necessarily connect with the geometry of the characters, it's all very believable.   Naturally the graphics are geared to improve in the future. Sony wants this game to be competitive with game's released three years from now and, without predicting too much, I can say they've got a pretty damn good shot at it. The downside to this is that the game can't yet be viewed in all its glory. Any attempts to do so will result in terrible performance. I've been playing on an Alienware 51 and I can get solid, consistent performance with the visual details you can see in my screenshots. Trying to run the game any prettier starts to impact the speed of the game.      For all its beauty, I'm not as huge a fan of the game's overall visual style. Particularly when you're talking about the areas around Freeport, the overall aesthetic seems to scream, ~Look how many shades of brown we have!~ I think the art team could have done more with less here.  I had honestly assumed that the inclusion of voices would be more of a gimmick. I was surprised to realize just how great an effect it can have on the game. While it's ultimately a ~non-essential~ feature, having NPCs who really speak to you makes the game seem so much more alive than it would otherwise. I'm sure we've all played MMOs that just felt quiet, too quiet. Playing an hour or so of EverQuest 2 will show you just how effective voiced dialogue can be in terms of drawing you into the game world and enhancing its credibility.  With one single exception, the sound effects are fantastic. From the ambient sounds of wind and weather to the shouts of monsters and animals, the sound palette is completely believable. The only sound that I can't stand is the annoying grunt that characters let out when they jump into the air. You should only ever make that sound if you accidentally knee yourself in the groin. This being impossible, I suppose we can assume you should never make this sound.  The game's music is fantastic. The score, recorded by an actual orchestra, has a really strong presence in the game. It has an epic feel to it that completely supports the action in the game. Sadly, the epic feel doesn't quite fit the moments of inaction. More appropriate music cueing would have been nice, but I'll take the heroic, forceful music all the time if that's my only choice.   The trick with massively multiplayer online games is for the farmer to hold the carrot close enough to the donkey's nose that he occasionally gets a nibble but not so close that the donkey eats the whole thing before the farmer gets where he's going. Now this metaphor might be a little tricky for you literal minded types so let me spell it out: the donkey is you, the carrot represents your in-game achievements and the farmer is Sony. Where he's going is to the bank with a cartful of subscription fees.I can't criticize the game because it adheres to this model but I definitely feel that the developers are holding back a bit out of fear that you'll accomplish too much and either grow bored or run out of content. The first EverQuest didn't feel nearly this restrictive. By tenth level my human monk had seen the wonders of the elven cities and had slogged through the swampy homeland of the trolls.If EverQuest 2 is a little stingier when it comes to rationing out the wonders of exploration, at least it offers up a lot more quests in the initial starting areas. As such you'll find yourself thoroughly mining a few zones before you're ready to move on to new areas. Grasshopper players who like to jump from place to place and sample lots of different experiences will find this to be a little confining but the upside is that there's always plenty of opportunity to do something constructive to advance your character.There's no doubt that EverQuest 2 is the most refined expression of the model that the first game sparked. The beauty of the visuals and the variety of quests are definitely the high points for the game, but you shouldn't discount the game's presentation either. Balanced against those strengths are the game's slowness in opening up new content and some inconveniences in the organization of quests.", "date": "Nov 29, 2004"}
