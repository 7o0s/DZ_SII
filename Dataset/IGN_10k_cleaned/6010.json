Crash: Warped, Final Fantasy VIII. They're all classic PlayStation games, but they're old hat compared to Rugrats. Rugrats Search for Reptar symbolizes the new image for Sony's PlayStation in so many ways. Last year, after hitting the bull's eye in the hardcore market and watching Nintendo peg its traditional younger boys target market, Sony began its new goal. And it's THQ that's doing all the hard work.  It's not that Sony will ever betray the hardcore market, not by any means, it's just that Rugrats is important on a whole new level. It's a game based on an immensely popular cartoon, it's now a full-motion picture in theaters nationwide, and it's a videogame. Cross marketing with Burger King and several other well-placed companies puts Rugrats in the perfect position to score hugely in every way possible. Sony should truly be proud of THQ's key title. Except for the small fact that Rugrats suffers from some shameful gameplay fundamentals that make it a rough and painful experience.  Rugrats is a full 3D platform game starring all of your favorite characters, including Tommy, Angela, Grandpa, Chuckie, Phil and Lil, Spike, and the rest of the gang. You can play with either digital or analog controls, and both work well. In fact, analog is preferable and smoothly done.   You'll encounter several different show-based levels, such as finding Grandpa's teeth, playing tag, zapping aliens, experiencing the dark depths of the supermarket, and rescuing Cynthia's boat from the sewer with Spike. There are 10 basic levels with six bonus ones opening up later, and you'll experience easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels in your toddler-perfect world.  The gameplay elements are fun enough, and there's no doubt that it's fun as hell just tottering around as the Rugrats characters themselves. They're funny, too. They'll say little things along the way, which make the often mediocre levels a little more entertaining.  Graphically, the game is plain and simple. Basic, repetitive textures and Gourard shading dictate the way Rugrats looks, and it comes off well. After all, the cartoon is simple, too, and this game looks just like it.   Musically, the game is a little redundant, but again it's true to the show. Funny little tunes and looping, mindless circus songs will romp through your brain as you progress through this adorable game.  Overall, Rugrats performs a great job of replicating the show, but pulls off only a decent job of being fun to play outside of sheer novelty.This game will definitely please Rugrats fans, for sure. You'll put up with the mediocre gameplay and simplicity of it, too. You'll find great pleasure in seeing the hilariously cute cut-scenes in between levels, and laugh at all the silly jokes. In fact, Rugrats is actually a game for all ages, not just kids. Parents will have fun playing it together with their kids. In fact, I can already see baby boomer parents getting totally involved helping their kids through this one, wondering later what they've gotten themselves into.And I had fun playing it, too  in a sort childhood reversion kind of way (you know, turn off jaded thoughts, repress all previous game knowledge, dislodge all logic, etc.). It's undeniably cute. I couldn't give a flying fork about the Rugrats, and if they completely disappeared off the face of the earth, I wouldn't even notice. So for me to like this game is saying something.But it should be said that the problems in this game are classic. Walking into a small room shifts the camera angle so that your character faces the camera. Your commands will then reverse, so that backward if forward and backward is forward. Bad sign number one, especially in levels in which you're racing against time or someone else. Problem number two is that I felt motion sickness playing Rugrats. That certainly won't happen to everyone, but it's going to happen to those who have gotten it before. Third, any decent gamer will finish this puppy in about two hours. But put in the perpective of Rugrats' target market, most decently-skilled gamers won't buy this. Parents and maybe young teens will.All in all, I recommend that younger, easy-to-please, casual gamers pick this one up. Hardcore gamers and those ~way too cool~ to be seen playing cartoon games should definitely, definitely stay away.", "date": "Dec 3, 1998"}
