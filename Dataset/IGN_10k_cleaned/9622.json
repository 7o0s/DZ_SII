Not so much his appearance, mind - although there's often a whiff of 'old men playing tough' here - but more his schizophrenic personality. Much has been written about Lynch's darker side, that there's an evil inside he simply cannot control. The same is true of Kane & Lynch: Dead Men - for the most part it's a well conceived, action-packed tactical shooter, but then it has moments of utter madness. Not over-the-top Hollywood blockbuster extravagance though, which we'd welcome with open arms, but plain old stupidity.     Take one of the game's later stages. Kane, leading a group of mercenaries with Lynch in tow, heads to Havana to hunt down the remaining members of The 7 - an elite group of criminals Kane left for dead after a mission went terribly wrong. The gang must fight through enemy-infested streets to a safe house where Kane's targets are hiding. Thing is, the place is crawling with soldiers who can call on armoured vehicles and assault helicopters for back-up. Thankfully, Kane has contacts and calls upon the help of rebel fighters, who provide support in the battle. Only they don't, because in reality they're little more than cannon fodder. No matter how carefully you plan an assault and manage your team, they still last no longer than a few seconds once the bullets start flying. 'Cover? Pah, who needs that, I'll just stand out here in the open and' Blam. Dead.   In fact, the AI is so stupid at times that it's often easier to order your team-mates to hang back and work through the level on your own, picking off enemies one by one. Indeed, this is made all the more easy because your enemies are just as dumb and often stand statuesque while you pump them full of lead from the safety of a wall of sandbags. To be fair, the AI isn't always quite so absurd and there are times when Lynch will save your hide, but those moments are in the minority. More often than not, you're left to take out the bad guys because for all the shotgun shells your comrades let off they manage to hit, well, virtually bugger all.   Things aren't made any easier by the fact the enemy has an uncanny knack of ignoring all of your team mates and aiming everything they've got at you. Sure, the reasoning behind this is no doubt to ensure there's never a lull in the action and that you've always got something to do, but what's the point of having back-up if they don't really play a massive part in the game? Of course, you can use them as bait by ordering them out into the open to draw enemy fire while you hide behind cover, but the moment you pop your head out you become public enemy number one.   But - and it's a big but - bringing these team mates along for the ride, especially Lynch, really does add depth to the story. Dead Men isn't just another you-versus-the-world shooter, although there are moments in the game where it may feel like that. Instead it's a tale of treachery and odd friendships, of how one man's mistakes impacts on everyone around him, often with lethal consequences. Indeed, it's the story that really drives the game and therefore the player's desire to progress to the next level, to see how Kane and Lynch's fragile relationship develops and what can possibly go wrong next.     Without wanting to reveal spoilers, there are moments in the game that are genuinely shocking and times when you're forced to make challenging decisions. They're not always executed in exactly the right way - to explain more would spoil what are key moments in the game - but IO should be commended for putting such a large focus on the game's plot, on the development of the two lead characters and how they interact with each other. A silver screen version of Kane & Lynch is already in the works and if it nails the characters and scripting anywhere near as well as this then we'll be sat in the front row on opening night.   It's not just the story that shines, either. The opening of the game is superbly paced, from the moment Kane and Lynch are busted out of jail and are forced to escape from the police, to the Heat-inspired bank job and resulting street firefight that sees Kane and Lynch ducking between cars to avoid SWAT snipers. At these moments the game is fast and thrilling and, while it might not be quite as explosive as Call of Duty 4, it certainly has some very memorable moments.     That infamous club scene is great example. In a bid to get the loot, Kane kidnaps the daughter of one of The 7, who's hiding out in a Toyko night spot. It's a level that's been doing the rounds for a long time and we've sat through countless demos showing off the game's dynamic crowds but, despite this, it still felt fresh and exciting as Kane weaved his way through the dancing throng. Crank up the volume or listen through headphones and the combination of chest-thumping techno and strobe lights are quite unbalancing, but that's not a patch on what happens next, when the pair must flee with their hostage. Loud screams and the snap of gun fire cut through the heavy bass, as revellers realise all is not well and armed guards push their way through the masses in a bid to bring Kane and Lynch down. It's one of the most tense and disorientating game experiences we've played in a long time, trying to work out where shots are coming while covering Lynch's back.     It's a shame there aren't more of these moments then. By all accounts, many of the game's highlights are the levels that Eidos has been showing over the last 12 months - the opening police escape, the bank job and tower block abseil - and although a lot of the other levels are good, they're not epic. Indeed, many of the later levels, set in jungles and war-torn cities, feel like Ghost Recon rejects, which is a shame because Kane & Lynch excels when it's doing something different.   Still, IO has certainly tried something new with the multiplayer mode, Fragile Alliance. Here, up to eight players can team up to and perform a heist, from robbing a bank to holding up the local coffee shop and nabbing the takings. Games play out like so: working cooperatively, the members of the Fragile Alliance take on the AI-controlled cops, while scooping up bags of cash in the process. It's only when it's time to make a quick getaway that the action hots up, because if all eight escape then the loot is split equally eight ways. It's therefore in your bests interest to make sure as few people as possible make it out alive and if that means a sly slug in the back of a team mate's head then so be it. Of course, the moment you turn traitor your whereabouts are highlighted on the screens of your fellow players and, if they manage to bag you, they walk away with muchos dollar.   It's an interesting concept and one that works relatively well, once you get your head around it. You see, as someone new to the multiplayer mode, the natural instinct is to take out a few cops and scoop as much cash as possible, before opening up on your teams mates, without really considering how you're going to make your getaway. Unfortunately that often results in a bit of a stalemate - unless when you're resurrected as a cop (which happens when you die, enabling you to take revenge). The problem is that, in our experience, most people don't tend to get it, at least not for a while. So if you're a seasoned pro at Kane & Lynch the likelihood is, if you log onto a random Xbox Live game, you'll be shot to pieces by someone who thinks it's just another deathmatch. Of course, this won't always happen but our advice is hook up with mates and (hopefully) it'll be an enjoyable experience.   As for the co-op mode, it has some fundamental flaws. For starters, it's split-screen only and can't be played over Live, which is a crime in this day and age (although IO points the finger at those complex crowd sequences). Also, some of the game's better single-player mechanics don't translate to the co-op campaign. For instance, if you die in Kane & Lynch you can be resurrected by a team mate (or Lynch in the one-player game), who jabs an adrenalin shot into your chest. However, if it's not administered within a few seconds you'll die anyway. While it's all well and good when you're fighting alongside each other during co-op, during missions where you're forced to split up (such as the bank heist), it's simply impossible to help out your buddy, and if one person dies it's game over.     Also, playing as Lynch in the co-op isn't all it could've been. There's no getting away from the fact he suffers from blackouts and during these times he often does something really evil. But, when you're actually playing, you have no idea what happens - one second you're chugging along as normal, the next the screen turns black and you're in a different location, often with dead people all around. In the single-player game Lynch can be heard going crazy over the radio but in co-op his psychotic tendencies are somewhat lost. This wouldn't be so bad but occasionally this means that, as Lynch, there are extended periods of the game where you have nothing to do, such as when Kane is cracking the vault in the bank and you're left to guard the lobby - which means hanging around looking at the carpet.Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is a bit of a missed opportunity then. For everything it gets right  the gritty storyline, adrenalin-fuelled firefights and epic set-pieces  it falls flat on its face in other areas, like the stupid AI, disappointing co-op and occasionally by-the-numbers level design. Visually, its equally as unbalanced. There are times when it looks great, rappelling down the side of a skyscraper for example, but then there are moments when Kane and Lynchs faces look like theyre made from melting wax. In fact, the game almost feels rushed and that an extra six months development time wouldve made the world of difference. As its stands, Kane & Lynch: Dead Men is an interesting and often exciting - but ultimately flawed - tactical shooter.", "date": "Nov 23, 2007"}
