Needless to say, the title's success spawned a procession of great and not-so-great imitators, with even Codemasters unable to resist the urge to milk those nostalgia nipples until the teats began to chafe. With the law of diminishing returns firmly in place, last year's official fourth iteration of the series - Micro Machines V4 - roared onto PlayStation 2 and PSP. And lo, it wasn't particularly good.   Thankfully then, our expectations weren't exactly hoisted skyward when the DS version of Codemasters' golden child squealed in. Because, if they were, we'd be marching straight round and demanding some form of compensation for the systematic raping of our most precious childhood memories, back from the days when small cars were small cars, table top tracks were actually kind of cute and the series still had that blistering edge of freshness about it.   It's a shame too, because Micro Machines' traditional emphasis on bite-sized arcade action and multiplayer-focussed revelry would seem to make it ideally suited to Nintendo's handheld. Unfortunately, in reality, what's promising on paper quickly sinks under some astonishingly poor design decisions, technical deficiencies and a general sense of developer ennui. Really, it's difficult to know where to start, there's so much to pour scorn on. However, in the spirit of fairness, let's get the good points out the way first.   Undoubtedly, there's a surprising amount of things to do in Micro Machines V4. The single-player game offers up four challenge modes in four divisions across three difficulty levels. Success in the challenges steadily unlocks a huge roster of vehicles (although, as we'll get into, you probably won't give too much of a toss), as well as a large, diverse number of courses. Challenges are split into Battle Cups, Race Cups, Checkpoint Cups and Battle League - all in all, fairly self-explanatory, although some are more successful than others. Battle Cups, for instance, are huge exercises in tedium - the idea being to knock your opponent off the screen by racing ahead as fast as you can. Trouble is, you need to do this eight times in succession to pass a challenge - and that, dear friends, is boring as hell. Checkpoint Cups manage to be the most enjoyable of the bunch, given that their inherently more sedate nature manages to off-set most of the game's more frustrating issues. However, attempt the potentially meatiest Race Cups and everything goes awry.   Problem one has a lot to do with a rather over-ambitious graphics engine which really expects too much from the humble DS hardware. Those cars, for instance, could quite easily be any kind of random amorphous blob, as could the array of completely indistinguishable power-ups lining the tracks. In other words, despite the huge roster of vehicles available in game, they're so laughably modelled and functionally indifferent, there's absolute no incentive to collect 'em all. The fact that you'll likely have a tough time telling power-ups apart, thus negating much in the way of strategic play, is the mere tip of the annoyance iceberg.   Despite being quite nicely varied in terms of environmental design, there's not much positive to say about the game's numerous tracks: the scenery's bland and textures are largely blocky to the point of being utterly indecipherable. Problematically, the default 'dynamic' camera is positioned way too close to the track too, making it near impossible to anticipate upcoming turns, position yourself to collect power-ups or even see where your opponents are to hit them with a couple of blasts from your offensive arsenal. With scenery generally represented by a series of angry, strobing pixels, it's virtually impossible to tell where you are at any point on a track - meaning that even attempting to memorise a course's layout is ultimately fruitless.    Clearly, the developer's noticed this as some point though, with a nominal driving line being added to each track by way of compensation. Unfortunately, this too is frequently lost in the blurry mess of textures or is spaced so far apart it becomes impossible to follow thanks to the awkwardly close camera. Of the three view points available, only the 'retro' top-down view offers anything approaching the useable. Bizarrely - given that it's practically standard with dual-screen racers these days - the bottom screen merely features driver health and position information. For some reason, a sorely-needed overhead map has been completely omitted.   Not that it would have helped the sluggish frame rate, which struggles to provide any illusion of speed or exhilaration. Add in the weirdly loose spin-on-a-dime car handling and the overall experience isn't so much one of driving around a track as floating along an undulating conveyer belt. By this point, it seems fairly perfunctory to talk about your computer-opponents' AI, which is just as well because they don't appear to have any. Even on 'easy', your competition doggedly sticks to the racing line, never once suffering the indignity of clipping against the impossible-to-predict obstacles. Sadly, the only tension present in races comes from the vain hope you won't crash into scenery, causing you to slow down just long enough to ensure your practically infallible opponents are instantly guaranteed victory.Ordinarily, this would be the point where we do the time honoured U-turn and proclaim the multiplayer aspect of Micro Machines as its saving grace. Unfortunately, most of the basic problems present in the single-player game rear their ugly head again and even some classic friendly rivalry can't save proceedings from being frustrating and, ultimately, just not fun at all. All in all, Micro Machines is proof that, sometimes, ambition isn't always a good idea, if it's not tailored to a particularly platform's strengths. Here are a couple of words Codemasters might want to consider for its next MM update: classic, 2D, top-down, goodness.", "date": "Jan 5, 2007"}
