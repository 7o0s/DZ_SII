{"name": "Psychic Force", "name_review": "Psychic Force", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/04/29/psychic-force", "text": "In their unending search for the new and improved, developers sometimes try to put a spin on an already established genre. Case in point: Taito's Psychic Force, released here in the United States by Acclaim. At its heart, it's a basic 3D fighting game, with punching and fireballs and all that, but Taito have decided to make everyone fly -- all the time -- so you never touch the ground. And while this is admittedly fun at first, the novelty of flying soon wears thin.  Pick from 8 psychic fighters, and take to the air in an enclosed, cubical arena. the arena appears 3D, but you can't actually move in and out of space, only up/down, and left/right. Because you're so far away from your opponent most of the time, you end up using fireball-like attacks a lot. In fact, two of the four buttons (one being block) are for projectiles. This becomes tiresome very quickly.   When you do get close enough to actually hit someone, it plays much like a regular fighter, albeit a rather poor one. The control is very sluggish, so much that your fingers are sore after a match from pushing on the buttons, trying to make your character move faster. The character design is rather nice, drawn in the familiar Japanese anime style, but the graphics are grainy and choppy, and don't do the characters justice. The animated intro is cool though.  Think of Psychic Force like crack. It's a cheap, immediate thrill, and gets you flying like no other. But once the initial high wears off, you're stuck with a hollow experience that never lives up to its initial expectations.", "date": "Apr 29, 1997"}
