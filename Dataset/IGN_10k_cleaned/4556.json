But that is exactly how the story begins in Midnight Nowhere, with the main character waking up, unzipping the bag and crawling out.  He looks around and sees he is in a room full of corpses. It is quite cold.  After escaping this room, the mission then becomes to learn his identity and discover who is killing everyone around him.   The first thing you'll notice is that this isn't your grandmother's adventure game.  It is completely inappropriate for children and anyone who is offended by profanity, sexual references and naked women.  Within the first 10 minutes you'll be hit by two words banned by Network Television and by the end of the game you'll be surprised by the number of gross sexual comments made by the main character.  It isn't the kind you can ignore, either.  For example, one puzzle will require taking batteries from a device which many a woman is intimately familiar with.  A lot of this can be attributed to the Russian development company, as the game was recently translated for an American audience, which is plagued by many more hang-ups about sexuality.   Getting past this, the game's story isn't bad and could even be said to be compelling.  Finding our own identity is quickly overridden by the need to discover who is killing everyone in your path.  Each body you find is killed in a different manner and you tart to wonder what is coming next.  The puzzles make perfect sense in line with the story and are so well placed that they're nearly unnoticeable and don't take you out of the tale.  Very few adventure games can do this even well, but Midnight Nowhere excels at that.   Many puzzles involve remembering clues to unlocking doors or finding randomly placed items hidden in plain sight. I especially enjoyed a puzzle which required knowledge of history and some math skills to answer riddles. If that isn't your cup of tea, giving a wrong answer doesn't hurt you; you can keep guessing until you get it right.  A part of me wishes something bad happened, of course, upon giving a wrong answer but that would probably have been needlessly frustrating for some people.     The interface is easy to understand.  There are several icons at the top that, when clicked, allow the user to examine, use and pick-up items or talk to the very few living characters in the game.  The one frustration with this system is that you have to click on one of the icons, then the item you want to interact with. The use and pick-up icons are not always used the way you would think they should be so at times it doesn't make sense.    Also, sometimes a hotspot doesn't show up under normal circumstances and some hotspots are very difficult to find or understand.  I had specific trouble in two spots.  The first was on a desk, where there was a way to get to the desk drawer, but the hotspot was hard to find, since a lamp was in the way.  The second spot I had trouble with was a faucet which you ended up having to turn.  This spot boggled me for hours.  Most times, though, the hotspots are obvious and the manipulation of them makes perfect sense.   The graphics are pretty good although the cutscenes probably could have been done better.  One particularly gripping image is of a dark hallway with a hung up corpse visible and behind that, a bright light.  The posters were also a nice touch, making you believe you were really in another world.  Many faces were grotesquely distorted and this only helped suspend your disbelief at the world you were now facing.  The sound effects were okay, but at times I feel could have been more gripping.  The music was nicely done and even entertaining.  The voice acting was adequate, but nothing to write home about.    Midnight Nowhere is a pleasant surprise.  For old school fans, it has the edginess of a Tex Murphy game, although not quite as good.  Midnight Nowhere sometimes goes too far with the adult theme.  I enjoyed the story but the ending was a big disappointment.  The ending might even confuse most players because the explanation happens so quickly and is very vague.  However, despite the ending the story is still gripping.  It's an excellent point-and-click adventure game and a good addition to any genre fan's library, provided you are over the age of 18 and don't mind a little full frontal nudity.", "date": "Mar 17, 2004"}
