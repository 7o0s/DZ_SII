Chris has liked fighting games since Street Fighter 2 first changed the gaming world, but he's recently grown disgruntled over the prevalence of flash over substance in games such as Marvel VS Capcom, X-Men VS Street Fighter, and the various other ~modern~ fighters coming out of Capcom.  Even Alpha 3 with its air blocking and custom combos had him questioning the very notion of the advancement of the fighting genre.  I was under the impression, from the very outset, that Chris was full of hog-wash.  The only reason he didn't like all the newer Capcom fighting games was because I was whoopin' his ass at 'em from time to time, and he just couldn't stand it.  And then, we put in a copy of the classic Street Fighter 2 Turbo, running in compilation form on the Saturn, and things changed.  Not only did Chris whoop my ass at the game, but he did it consistently, and without reserve.  My Chun Li, who'd jumped leaps and bounds over and above his Ryu in X-Men VS Street Fighter stood no chance in this older game.  Over and over, I lost, unable to come even close to winning a single round.  I went from winning 50% of the time in X-Men VS Street Fighter to winning 0% of the time in Street Fighter 2 Turbo.  So what was going on?  It's a little something called skill.  While I don't doubt that the newer Capcom fighting games have balance, there's just so much to them, from aerial raves to custom combos to super jumps, that you'd have to be legendary arcade-goer ~Joe Arcade~ himself to beat out a random button masher.  You can definitely work at the game enough to become a master, but unless you're real good, someone with ~less skills~ than you has a good chance of winning.  Not so with Street Fighter 2 Turbo.  There's a lot less to this game than in the versus series, and whatever is there exists for substance rather than flash.  It's easy to come to grips with all the possible moves, thus allowing you to spend time building your skill level by working on how to best use those moves. Street Fighter III takes the Street Fighter series back to this level, the level found in the pre-Versus games; in fact, the game is even lacking some of the features found in Alpha.  Playing the game for the first time will be somewhat of a revelation for the kids weaned on the more modern 2D fighters.  Never mind that the cast, aside from Ryu, Ken, and Akuma, is entirely new, with twelve newcomers: Sean, Yun, Yang, Alex, Ibuki, Elena, Dudley, Oro, Necro, Hugo, Urien and Gill.  Actually, despite the new faces, these characters will be familiar to all Capcom fans, as their moves are of the same variety found in all of Capcom's 2D fighters.  No, it's actually the gameplay changes that will confuse some at first.  Air Blocking is gone, for instance, replaced with a difficult-to-master parry system that fits in with the rest of the game.  Parrying a move in the air or on the ground requires that you push towards or down on the controller as the move hits, and the timing can be very difficult.  I can't wait to see the expression on little Johnny Punk-boy's face when he realizes that pushing back on the controller when in the air just won't cut it any more.  The super moves are also different, as they're far more simple than the crazy combos of the Versus series.  It's best to compare the super moves to those of the original Alpha and Street Fighter 2 Turbo.  Street Fighter 3 refers to its super moves as Super Arts, and each character has three such moves, with your selecting one, and only one, for use when selecting your character.  The supers fit into the strategy so much better here than in the Versus games.  Fights become a combination of regular attacks along with the occasional well timed super move, as opposed to the constant flood of super after super after super after super found in Marvel vs Capcom.  You'll also find varying special move power, just like in Alpha, where executing a special move with multiple buttons will result in a more powerful version of the move, usually with an added graphical effect, like flames or blue . . . stuff.  Additionally, the fighting system seems to have been refined so that many of the cheaper combos have been eliminated, or modified.  I suppose you could best describe Street Fighter III as follows: take Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, add in Street Fighter Alpha, and take the average.  That's a pretty good general statement, although exploring the inner depths of the fighting system will clue you in on the specifics (actually, you may want to head on over to our affiliate, gamefaqs.com and grab yourself one of the million FAQs available for the game, if you really want to see the depth that can be found).  People were somewhat disappointed by the game when it the arcades, as it didn't cause quite the revolution expected of the long awaited third game in the series (and this was despite Capcom of America's attempts at making the thing sound cool by calling it, simply, ~Three.~)  Well, what do you expect?  Capcom had refined the 2D fighting system for years with various updates.  Super moves, cheapness fixes, and other elements had been taken care of long before Street Fighter 3 was even announced, making the final product look more like just a super refined game in the endless Street Fighter series, as opposed to a true sequel.  Hey, if Sega had updated the gameplay of the Virtua Fighter series multiple times, VFII wouldn't have had nearly the impact it did, even with its insane graphics.  That's actually a good analogy, as Street Fighter III is, undoubtedly a sequel to all the other Street Fighter games, in the graphical sense.  We're talking about some of the smoothest animation you've ever seen, at least five times the level found in Alpha.  Seeing Ryu and Ken for the first time, with their flowing robes can be a nearly religious experience, as it looks simply amazing.  And don't even get me started on Elena - download the bonus round video from below to see the constant motion of this character.  The backgrounds, unfortunately, don't show the same level of improvement, as the level of animation seems at the level of Alpha, and there's still dithering to be found.  Also, the next level of 2D graphics should run in 640X480 resolution, something that we can probably expect from Guilty Gear 2 and SNK vs. Capcom.  The Dreamcast version replicates the animation quite closely, at least to the untrained eye, and the ugly pixels that have affected previous 2D fighters on the DC are nowhere to be found here.  Furthermore, and this is the thing that shocked me, the game achieves so high a level of animation with near zero load time before matches.  Select a character, select your super art, wait for the attract screen and music to play, and you'll be in a fight the next moment.  You can even skip some of the fluff by pressing buttons like a madman on your controller, and the game still seems to load the fight without resorting to a still black screen.  I was as impressed as when I first saw X-men VS Street Fighter first running on the Saturn with its next to nothing load times, and if this is your first fighting game after having played through the various PlayStation fighters out there, you may find yourself blown away into a heart attack.  The Dreamcast version also seems to replicate the arcade gameplay perfectly, especially when playing with the ASCII 6 button controller (although, I wish ASCII had made that D-PAD a bit software - it hurts after a few hours!).  Included in the package are the first two versions of the arcade SFIII, New Generation and 2nd Giant Attack.  These two versions are kept separate, and are selectable at the start of the game, but the only differences between the two are more characters in 2nd Giant Attack and a few additions to help clean up the gameplay.  You'll probably find yourself playing through 2nd Giant Attack most often, making the inclusion of the first game nothing more than just a novelty.  In terms of specifics for the DC version, you'll find a limited training mode that's made difficult to use due to the lack of a restart button that would set the characters back to their starting position.  You'll also find a versus mode that allows you, with a bit of fiddling, to go up against the computer in versus style.  The versus mode also allows for players to select their Super Arts on a round by round basis.  In 2nd Giant Attack mode only, you'll find a Blocking Attack Mode, where you can refine your air parrying skills by blocking basketballs that an opponent tosses at you (see the video below for more).  This game is actually the bonus round found in the game proper.  That's all there is, though.  This conversion isn't anywhere near the level found in the Alpha 3 conversion - an unfortunate thing, as the Street Fighter name deserves a lot more.  An ideal product would have modes similar to those of Alpha 3, along with, maybe, some high res ending artwork aside from the arcade stills.  The game is still perfect for Capcom fanatics looking for the next level of Capcom animation, though, or any fighting game fan who's sick of the craziness that's become of the 2D fighting genre.  However, I must admit that I got more enjoyment out of Alpha 3 due to its world tour mode and various modes of play.  Hopefully, when Third Strike hits home, complete with Chun Li, Capcom will give us a conversion more worthy of the Street Fighter name.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 17, 1999"}
