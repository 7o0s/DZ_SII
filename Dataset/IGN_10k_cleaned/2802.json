It is yet another football game and it is built using the next generation Madden NFL engine, but NCAA Football 2003 is a whole different ball game because of the nature of the college game itself and Tiburon's attention to detail in bringing that college game to life.   Beyond the solid football engine itself, several improvements have made the jump from the 2002 (on PS2) to the 2003 edition of NCAA Football seem like a quantum leap. The Create-A-School feature and Trophy Room lead the pack of cool new things that put NCAA Football at the forefront of this year's crop of football titles (NFL or otherwise) and licensed sports games in general.   The Features  25 New mascot teams 3D cheerleaders (male and female, no less) More than  200 authentic school fight songs School specific entrances  Play Rival Schools for 23 real life trophies Trophy Room Create-a-School- replace any school with your own including uniform, stadium and fight song 28 Bowl Games including the new San Francisco and Queen City Bowls Unlock special NCAA cards that can be used in Madden 2003 Favorite Team personalization. Customize the game interface with your favorite university's colors, mascot and fight song. 117 Division 1-A and 27 Division 1-AA schools   Gameplay This college football game is more or less aimed at the same hardcore football crowd that's been playing Madden for years. Even the easiest game modes will require some familiarity with Tiburon's complicated, but extremely functional football engine. The basics of passing, running the football and defending against both that we learned in Madden are re-applied because of the wide open nature of college football. There's more field to work with because of the wider hash marks, plus you've got the definitive play of college football to deal with: the option. Not to mention the additional formations you'll have at your disposal like the double wing and power I sets that you won't see in EA's NFL series. Tiburon has tuned these plays and the players so that it has a college feel with varying levels of talent up and down the rosters.   Where NFL videogame franchises are usually judged by the sophistication of their passing attacks, you can look the offense as a whole in NCAA Football 2003 and see that is the game's strength. There are several styles of plays and playbooks you can use provided you have the personnel to execute that kind of offense. The default settings for a team like Florida is a wide open passing attack so you'll see plenty of shotgun formations, single back sets and five receiver spread formations. Plus you'll get the quarterback and receivers to run those plays. A team like Nebraska will be loaded with outstanding offensive linemen and a deep roster of running backs to facilitate that power running game the Huskers are known for.   Division coaches often have one or two truly outstanding (read: fast) players to work with on offense so you'll see them come up with all kinds of creative ways to keep the football in their hands. The playbooks reflect this so that a non-football power like Cal will have to plays that take advantage of the one guy who can actually do some damage on offense. In the Golden Bear's case that would be the quarterback, Kyle Boller, but remember he's passing to a crop of players with even less talent than Boller himself. So you'll see a lot of plays in Cal's playbook designed to get receivers in wide open space so they'll have plenty of room to catch the ball even if they're not gaining a lot of yards. The assumption is that a good QB can complete enough passes to bad receivers to move the chains but at the cost of an explosive big play offensive attack.  Admit it -- you want to marry this game.  The defenses in NCAA Football 2003 seem extremely limited when compared to the offenses, but then again this is the nature of the sport. On defense you're given the 4-4 and 5-2 defensive formations in addition to the 4-3, 3-4, nickel, dime and goal line sets you'll see in NFL games. Those two extra formations are designed  to both counter the run and to allow more of your team strengths on the field. That is, if you have a lot of good linebackers, you'll want those guys on the field as much as possible so run the 4-4 to keep your studs out there. Same thing with the 5-2 since a lineup of run stuffing hogs will ruin any team's chances of running against you.   All of these are just examples of how far Tiburon has taken the college football experience on the field. It's what makes this a college football videogame rather than an NFL game with college logos and uniforms.  But there's more.  The College Experience We're still waiting for the sordid game that captures all of the bacchanalian, yet memorable elements of the college years, but for now we're thrilled with the football part of that equation that EA is giving us. The Trophy Room could be the greatest addition to sports games since analog control. In Dynasty mode, any championships or individual season awards that you win will be thrown into your player profile's Trophy Room. This means conference championships, bowl championships, coach of the year awards and Heismans will all be in one convenient location. Some trophies are better than others. The BCS trophies are pretty elaborate and fancy looking, while the plaque you get for winning the Mountain West conference is just okay. The Sears National Championship trophy is something to be particularly proud of, much like the Heisman because they're so recognizable. The plaques for the other awards are just so-so, but you can get rid of the ones you don't want when they start piling up year after year.       The other half of your trophy case should be dedicated to all of the rivalry trophies that you can collect both within and outside the dynasty mode. The trophy room is attached to your profile so that whenever you play a rivalry game with a trophy at stake, whether it's against the CPU or a buddy you and your profile are on the hook for that trophy. They've provided a rivalry mode so we'll have an easier time finding all of the big rivalries for all of the teams, including the Division 1AA schools like Florida A&M and Norfolk State, and the ones with trophies. All classic rivalries are acknowledged like Georgia and Florida's World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail party in Jacksonville, but only certain games like Cal and Stanford's Big Game have a traveling trophy at stake. USC and Notre Dame's battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh yields one of the nicer trophies while Michigan and Michigan State's Battle for the Paul Bunyan Trophy or Air Force-Army's Battle for the Commander-in-Chief Trophy will give you nothing more than bragging rights even with the word ~trophy~ in the title.   Here's a complete list of rivalry games that have trophies you can win for your Trophy Room. Keep in mind there are still classic rivalries represented in NCAA Football 2003 that don't have hardware:   Arizona-Arizona State's The Big Game LSU-Arkansas's Battle for the Golden Boot Boston College-Notre Dame's Battle for the Ireland Trophy Cal-Stanford's The Big Game Cincinnati-Miami (OH)'s Battle for the Victory Bell Houston-Rice's Battle for the Administaff Bayou Bucket Illinois-Northwestern's Battle for the Sweet Sioux Tomahawk Indiana-Purdue's Battle for the Old Oaken Bucket Indiana-Michigan State's Battle for the Old Brass Spittoon Iowa-Iowa State's Battle for the Cy-Hawk Trophy Kansas-Missouri's Border War Minneosta-Michigan's Battle for the Little Brown Jug Notre Dame-Michigan State's Battle for the Megaphone Wisconsin-Minnesota's Battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe  Minnesota-Penn State's Battle for the Governor's Victory Bell Mississippi State-Ole Miss's rivalry game for The Egg Bowl New Mexico State-UTEP's battle of I-10  Notre Dame-USC's Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh Oklahoma-Texas' Red River Shootout UCLA-USC's Battle for the Victory Bell Virginia-Virginia Tech's Battle for the Commonwealth Cup Virginia Tech-West Virginia's Battle for the Black Diamond Washington-Washington's rivalry game for the Apple Cup   The Create-a-School feature is a lot more satisfying than a create-a-team feature you'd find in an NFL team because 99% of the time the first school any gamer will create will be an alma mater or some other school not featured in the game but one that you're extremely familiar with. Sometimes it might be a junior college or Division III school or cancelled football program that only you might recognize, but all of the color, stadium, logo and uniform customization options are more than enough to bring your vision to life. When you're done with all of the superficial parts, you pick your team play style and caliber so the CPU can assign a whole crop of original, named players to your new squad. You'll have talent at the positions that are critical for your style of play so you'll get great QBs and RBs with good hands if you want to run a West Coast offense. Or in the case of choosing Juggernaut or Cupcake as your team style you'll be either loaded or completely devoid of talent, but all of this determines the initial prestige rating for your team as well. Sliding your team into the Division 1 schedule in Dynasty Mode means replacing an existing team since you'd throw off all of the scheduling if you made your team the 11th member of the Pac-10 or the 12th member of the Big Ten. After this however, your all new original squad is a Division I team that can compete for bowl bids, conference championships and national titles and players that can win Heismans, MVPs and other trophies.  In the offseason you have to recruit players just like everybody else so your school location will play a huge role in what kind of recruits you'll attract. A California team will have a huge talent pool to draw from but the competition for blue chip recruits is phenomenal from both local schools and national powerhouses. The offseason recruiting system, just as we saw in the previous PS2 game, is one of the most enjoyable parts of NCAA Football 2003. The challenge of attracting enough players to fill holes in your roster yet keeping an eye on an NFL caliber player that can make you a contender is unlike any other offseason system in any videogame. There's no trading or free agency in college ball, so the guys you recruit will be the players you're stuck with. Changing your offensive philosophy or playbook is not out of the question if you suddenly find yourself stocked with a ton of great players at a particular position. Be sure to check our upcoming feature on the offseason of NCAA Football 2003, but for the purposes of this review just know that it's awesome.   Graphics The visuals of NCAA Football 2003, are very closely related to Madden's look but Tiburon's included enough trappings of college football that it feels like it's own game. There are plenty of animation improvements over the PS2's NCAA Football 2002 especially for the receivers and defensive backs. Not all of the animation improvements we're going to see in Madden have made it into NCAA 2003 which could be an indication of the college game's relationship to last year's Madden title.   NCAA's graphic presentation is very impressive.  The framerate occasionally suffers on all three systems but only in those situations where all 22 players are on screen and in close proximity to each other. Usually, a goalline stand where everybody's is bunched up and executing sophisticated blocking/defensive attack routines, there will be some noticeable slowdown and sluggishness. It's interesting that the game both slows down in game speed and framerate at the same time.  The character models themselves are nice and detailed all the way down to the pride stickers on the helmet (even ones you make in Create-a-School). The faces are up to Madden 2003 quality with facial expressions and moving eyes. Of course you only see the individual faces when a helmet pops off or when you're in the player editor where you can change everything from faces to hairstyle to equipment to names.       GameCube owners will notice a pronounced blurring effect on the players after each play is run. As the players are getting up after a play and heading back to the huddle, the running back or receiver who just had the ball will be in crisp focus, while everybody around him in both the background and the foreground will be extremely blurry. It's an attempt to re-create a television camera effect, but it's fairly painful on the eyes. The Xbox version features a nice shiny polished sheen on the player uniforms even on dark colors so the jerseys seem like actual fabric rather than just dark paint. The helmet reflections of the surrounding stadium and lights are particularly noticeable in both the Xbox and PS2 where you can see the sun shining off their lids on a bright day or the ring of stadium lights shining off the top of the helmet like a crown.   Sound Full immersion surround sound in a football game is a wonderful thing. Your subwoofer will be rumbling just like your monster fullback or bone crushing defensive tackle in NCAA Football 2003. Xbox owners will enjoy the Dolby Digital Surround Sound while GameCube and PS2 owners will get a nice kick out of the Pro Logic sound effects. The crowd behind you, the coaches on the sidelines and the commentators will all be shooting at you from all around, much to your delight.   The commentary is improved, and one of the Behind the Scenes DVD extras even tells us so, but you'll still recognize a significant part of the commentary since so much of it is situational. If you play the game often, which EA fully expects you too, it's very likely that you'll be running the same plays, scoring the same touchdowns and in the same situations over and over again. Those situations will call up the same commentary time and time again. However, there are a lot of new comments from Brad Nessler, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso and they're nice surprises when you happen to run into them. Of course the fact that you have a three man announcing team is enough to make the commentary of NCAA Football 2003 better than most other football games, pro or otherwise.  The sound effects from the crowds and the players are nice touches and can't be fully appreciated until you get yourself in a surround sound environment. The Kenwood receiver and Sony speaker set up we used rocked our football world.  There are fight songs and chants for all 117 D-1 teams are outstanding and drive home the college feeling that the game is trying to capture. From the Naval Academy's ~Anchor's Away~ to that Trojan chant thing USC fans do this game sounds like college football from beginning to end.Forget about best college games, NCAA Football 2003 is the best football game out there for serious football videogamers. It has an inherent advantage over NFL titles because college football itself features the most wide open gameplay south of the CFL and ain't nobody hankering to play as the Montreal Alouettes any time soon. Every videogame is supposed to include a dose of fantasy in a believable world and college football is no different. It's like you're the athletic director, university president and coach all rolled into one and everything you say goes. Plus the fact that you're competing with 116 other football teams compared to the 30 teams you'll find in an NFL game makes players, yards and points that much more precious. Challenging and satisfying is the only way to describe NCAA Football 2003. Sports games in general already have built-in longevity since no two contests will ever be alike, but with the create-a-school function, trophy case and wonderful Dynasty Mode, NCAA 2003 has set a new standard for value in a videogame. You'll drop $50 for this disc, love it and keep on loving it until spring practice. Casual gamers, hardcore sports fans, RPG fans and trenchcoat-wearing weirdos should all have a go at NCAA Football 2003, because it's the best thing going. The only thing keeping this game from scoring closer to a perfect 10 is the equally inherent nature of sports games where there's always, repeat ALWAYS room for improvementeven when you're the best in your class, like NCAA Football 2003.", "date": "Jul 18, 2002"}
