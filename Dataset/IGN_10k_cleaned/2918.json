This formula worked wonders with NBA Jam/Showtime and NFL Blitz, which were born in the arcade, and made succesful transitions to home consoles. Building on this success, Midway expanded its sports lineup to include soccer (Redcard), and baseball (MLB Slugfest).  Last year, they also included hockey in their line-up, in the form of NHL Hitz 20-02. The game surprised us with addictive gameplay, tight control and great graphics.  Luckily, Midway has decided to give us more of a good thing. Much more. NHL Hitz 20-03 surpasses its predecessor in every possible way, and sets itself as the premiere sports offering in the Midway lineup. This year's edition broadens its scope to include an excellent Franchise mode, new mini-games, and a full NHL Season Mode... which should combine to keep you playing this one the whole year through. There are tons of features here, as well. There is lots more stats tracking than in the past, and virtually every area of the game is customizable. The little things are all sewn up. The menus are easy to navigate and the user points system simple to manage. The disc is packed with goodness, including tons of the unlockables and other goodies you've come to expect from Midway sports games.  If you love action sports games, this is a no-brainer. If you love hockey, it's an even easier decision. If you also have friends who like to play games against you and each other, well, then... you need this game, my friend.  Gameplay Someone once said there is great beauty in simplicity, and this axiom holds true when playing Hitz. The gameplay is as straightforward as it gets. Your three guys (and goalie) are trying to get the puck past the other three guys and their goalie. You can use any means at your disposal--blistering slap shots, ice-shaking hits, and dekes that would make Wayne Gretzky blush. There isn't anything too fancy about the Hitz engine, and that's a good thing. For action-based, arcade-style hockey, gameplay needs to be easy to pick up and hard to put down. Hitz delivers on both counts.  Luckily, the controls are tight, responsive and easy to learn. Within ten seconds of grabbing the controller, you've got the basic moves down, and it's all about testing skills against your foe. It's the perfect dorm room  game, in the same way the old Genesis NHL games were. Remember that scene from Swingers? Don't be surprised if you see that reenacted over a game of Hitz in a neighborhood near you.    One of the coolest additions to the control is the ability to go on fire at the touch of a button. As you perform moves, shots and lay down big hits, a meter fills up toward your fire. Rather, two meters fill up... one for you and one for your team. As long as your meter is full, you determine when you will use the juice. While the fire isn't as effective as it was last year, it's still nice to know you can turn it on when you need it.  Hitz is a better multiplayer game than anything, but that shouldn't surprise anyone. What's nice about this year's edition, however, is that the franchise portion of the game has been expanded considerably. In addition, there is a full NHL Season mode, plus Mini Games and Hockey School with Scotty Bowman, the NHL's winningest coach.  Hockey School is basically just a training mode, but it's useful to quickly learn all the controls in the game, and also unlocks something (what doesn't?). The Mini Games are a lot of fun, and teach you the basic skills of the game in the process. There are games like Shooting tic-tac-toe, and keep away, and each of these serves as its own party game. The games are as good or better than something like Fuzion Frenzy, and add more value to an already valuable game.  The Season and Franchise Modes are really where it's at, though. They are both quite beefy in terms of features, stats and long-term playability. The Season Mode allows you to play one season with your favorite NHL team. Go through the entire regular season, the playoffs, and the Cup. The Season Mode is great for those seeking a simulation-style environment (in terms of season structure).  For those who like to build something from scratch, there's the Franchise Mode. This allows you to create a team from the ground up-- you pick the jerseys, logos, city, and make all of the players. Sure, there's a way to automate the process, but why would you want to? When creating teams and players, there are tons and tons of customizable options to choose from. More objects and gear are unlocked as you progress as well, making your team a changing work of art.   The creativity that went into this mode is quite impressive. While the ultimate would be full reign over logo design, team name, etc., this is the next best thing. There are hundreds of different team names, including crazy things like the Ukees, and lots of excellent player nicknames (like Meat, Ogo and Vulture). All of the choices made in the creation of the team will be present during gameplay. If you nickname your guy Tim, that's what the announcer will say when he shoots the puck. All of the customization makes the Franchise Mode a unique experience, indeed.  The actual structure of Franchise is a kind of world tour, which reminded me of SEGA's Virtua Tennis or Soccer Slam, and more recently Midway's own Redcard.  Your upstart franchise travels around the globe battling rival hockey teams, in a variety of fantasy environments. As you play and win, you'll unlock new regions and harder teams until you're facing NHL squads in North America. Along the way, you'll have to complete challenges to unlock new gear and attributes, then spend it in the Locker Room.   The Locker Room gear provides RPG-style enhancements. You can unlock new gear that is +5 to Speed or Passing, and enhance your player's strengths in this way. The equipment, which is all licensed, serves as just another layer of depth to an already meaty game.  In addition to the Franchise Mode, the AI has gotten a lot better. Before you get your bearings in the single player game, you'll get rung up and sat down a few times. Gone are the days of the 13-goal game (for the most part). Gone are lopsided shutouts (unless you're taking down your roommate) of last year's game. The goalies aren't letting your weak trash by anymore, and that should come as a relief to everyone. Hitz has become downright stingy. In fact, the game almost swings too much the other way. The learning curve is much steeper, and that may deter some gamers from getting all they can out of the Franchise and Season Modes.    Since this is an arcade-style game (which is starting to lean ever-so-slightly toward the sim side of things), the single player gameplay can fall into a repetitive pattern. This can also be a problem for some gamers. It isn't the kind of game that inspires marathon sessions of single player action. Part of the problem is that the various players-- no matter big or small, fast or slow-- don't feel that different enough from one another. Sure, it's possible to unlock horse heads and weird apparel, but the skills of each individual player are not very visible. It can feel slightly like you're playing against an army of like drones, and that is a drawback. You won't notice it in the multiplayer game, but single player can eventually get old. Luckily, the equipment upgrades help out a little in this area, but even more obvious diversity in player skill would have been nice.    Graphics The graphics were already quite polished in last year's version of the game, but this time around, they're a little crisper. The arenas and ice are impressive, and the crowds are quite amazing. They are active and well-rendered, and provide a solid backdrop for the action.  The player models look good as well. They've grown a little since last year, but they look even better. Like Blitz, Hitz sports more realistic player models this year. They aren't the pumped-up, steroid-enhanced gorillas you've come to expect... these guys look downright normal (provided you're playing with an NHL team and not one of the fantasy squads). The faces look accurate, although you only get a close look at them during replays. The jersey textures could be better, as they seem rather low-res close up. From a ways back, they look fine, but you'll notice the lack of detail on facoffs and replays.  The effects are what really make this baby cook. The fire and particle effects that accompany the action are well done, but not overdone. The animations are nice, too, although they get quite repetitive. There aren't a whole lot of context-sensitive animations in the game, and the same deke motion gets old after a couple of games. Still, the game runs smooth, and the action flows well, so the repetitive movements are quite easily tolerated.  Sound Hitz showcases the same hyped-up, extreme announcer that we've come to expect from Midway titles. The commentary is pretty well-balanced, and it's anonymous enough not to get annoying in the long run.   If you get bored with the commentary, you can turn it off, and play a soundtrack instead. The in-game songs are quite extensive, and they can all be added and subtracted in the Jukebox. It's mostly from the nu-metal school, but if you can't tolerate that, there's a Moby song as well. Here are all of the tunes in the game:  Bombshell: Powerman 5000 Breakawy: OddManRush Circles: Incubus Feel So Numb: Rob Zombie Heavy Hitter: Zhu Zhu Petal Hockey Monkey: The Zambonis Pieces: Hoobastank Shot Score: The Zambonis Sinner: Drowning Pool Slapshot Man: The Zambonis The Breakaway: The Zambonis Thumping Groove: Zhu Zhu Petal We Are All Made of Stars: Moby Ham: Racing Tunes Take Care of the Lonely: Racing Tunes Lead Head: Racing Tunes Beauty Queen: Racing Tunes Breath of Giants: Fighting Mix Journey: Fighting Mix Wilderness: Fighting Mix  The game sounds are decent, but also repetitive. You've got all the standard sounds: hard checks, the puck slapping into the boards, the scrape of the stick as it shoots, and the general noises of skating. The skating and stick sounds are what will get to you down the stretch. The crowds sound good, but generic. They swell and accurately respond to the action, but the general tone stays pretty much the same... white noise.  NHL Hitz 20-03 is a huge improvement over an already tight game. If you're looking for one excellent multiplayer sports game, this one will fill that need. What's more, the single player game has  been improved considerably. Not only is it more challenging, but the Franchise and Season Modes will result in hours of solo gameplay.  This has supplanted Blitz as the marquee Midway Sports title. Play it. Love it. Own it.", "date": "Sep 13, 2002"}
