Big explosions, big weapons, lots of enemies flying at you. In theory, this can be a fun experience. It can also be Beachhead 2000. Unfortunately, Alien Blast is parked firmly in the latter camp. Speaking of being camped firmly, Alien Blast also has you manning a stationary turret. There will be many times when you wished you could perform even a perfunctory dodge, just to lessen the often punishing avalanche of monsters.  The setting is in deep space in the ~deep, dark frontiers of space,~ which is pretty sensational considering we can't even get a single person to Mars right now. I don't know, maybe if they shot for 2160 or 2260, it would be more believable. Is this a niggle? Perhaps. Do I feel the urge to niggle after wading through this game? Hah! Yes.  To its credit, the game gives you seven weapons to choose from, and each one serves a very different and helpful purpose. The basic one is a machine gun, great for mowing down scurrying little beasts. Another fires blasts that home in on the enemy and pack quite a punch. There's also a powerful ~dumb-fire~ blaster, a lightning gun-type thing, a nuclear-ish rocket launcher, a sniper rifle, and a flamethrower. On some of the 45 levels, a friendly vessel will float around a little bit and drop boxes that give you more ammo when you shoot at them.  Unfortunately, this friendly ship doesn't bother to attack anyone or even draw attention. I can just picture them sitting there on the bridge, placing bets as to how quickly I will get pummeled. Actually, they're probably not paying any attention to me at all, just playing Intergalactic Strip Poker or whatever. Something more fun than Alien Blast. Whatever the case, sometimes the ammo boxes drop behind obstructing scenery, like the base I'm supposed to be protecting, and that's no fun, lemme tell you, especially when you're low on ammo. For example, the nuke has two rounds. The sniper gun has four or five. Okay, maybe six. Then you're done. Click, click, click. The machine gun is the only weapon that doesn't eat up ammo like a stoner in a Funyuns factory.    There also some enemy vessels that float around innocuously, just kind of going for a casual Sunday drive through my deadly battlefield of doom. They have a bit of armor, but it's worth it to blow them out of the sky, because you automagically get your armor refilled for that. Sometimes this is useful, other times the timing of their appearance overlaps with a wave of enemies that makes it nearly impossible to make use of them.  Speaking of timing, there's an arduous wait before the fur starts flying. It may be only ten seconds or so, but after re-trying the same ~level~ several times (a few different setting like outer space, on a meteor, on a Martian-esque plain, all butt-ugly), it feels like forever. Why make me wait so long? Then there are lulls between each wave. What exactly is going on here? It's the same attack every time: Flying Dude attacks from the left then swoops over your head to the right, Scurrying Gang of Beasties scampers in from the northeast--the same vector every time. Within each level, there is no attack randomization. With each level re-try, the wait time and strategic monotony gets worse.  Thankfully, most of the levels are short hits. Unfortunately, there's 45 of these short hits, so it's difficult to keep things fresh. You can only introduce so many enemies and levels before it all starts to blur into one churning experience. The nuke is pretty cool, but you get a ridiculously small stockpile. It can be fun mowing down the little beasties, but not when a bunch of other stuff is flying at you kamikaze-style and dozens of creatures are on the screen pecking you to death with small-arms fire. There's this one level with an enormous dragon creature, but it has no tactics--it just relies on its iron-clad armor, floats around a bit, and spits a few fireballs at you. There's no AI in this game, no evasive action, no cooperative attacks, no retreat--just total, frantic, and eventually exhausting mayhem.  The faulty gameplay wouldn't be quite so painful if the visuals weren't so bad. To say it is ~dated~ would be an overstatement. The blurry textures, blocky objects, sprite-powered alien blood, and cheesy explosions hearken back to Strike Force: Alpha Centauri which was a pretty good-looking gamewhen it came out eight years ago. Alien Blast doesn't push PC visuals forward so much as it lassoes them with an electrified barbed-wire rope, pulls too hard, and ends up making a gooey mess of things.  And I know this may come as a shock, but sound doesn't fare much better. There's some surprisingly stirring music at the menu screen, but it's all downhill once the actual game gets in the way. The grating chatter of gunfire and generic booming noises are as ancient as the graphics. To be fair, Alien Blast could offer some diverting fun during your lunch break or some other time of day when you have nothing intentional to do. But then there's a whole world-- things like online puzzle games, clipping your nails, and having conversations with people (imaginary or otherwise)--that has much more potential for Good Times. If you are one of those anti-social types with no Internet connection (and somehow read this review!) and are still trudging along with, say, a Pentium II, then this might be your ticket. In other words, the market has moved beyond this kind of game.", "date": "Feb 24, 2004"}
