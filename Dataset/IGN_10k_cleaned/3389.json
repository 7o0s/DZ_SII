On the Game Boy Advance, the company was previously responsible for the rather lame ESPN X Games Skateboarding that just couldn't come close to matching what had already been done in Activision's own Tony Hawk series. But even when Konami alters its direction more towards the established Hawk GBA brand, it fails even more. Disney Sports Skateboarding is just a bad attempt at a portable skateboarding game, and it's even worse when you realize that this game's focus is the younger gaming crowd. Features Four selectable characters Eight skateparks Cartridge save (one slot) Only for Game Boy Advance   While Disney Sports Skateboarding initially looks like it was inspired by the GBA Tony Hawk series, its isometric perspective is all the game shares with Activision's game. In this game, players pick either Mickey, Minnie, Donald or Goofy to thrash around several different ~extreme~ skateparks of grind rails, quarterpipes and incline ramps. But other than the tutorial mode at the beginning of the main Trick Attack option, the developers don't explain the gameplay all that well, either in the game or in the instruction manual. What you're supposed to do is simply ride around in the parks, scooping up five different Check Point icons and maxing out the Technique Gauge within the allotted time. But these quotas don't always register due to the game's wonky implementation...and even when you've completed the tasks, the game will end as a failure. Not cool.  Special moves can only be pulled off if they're earned by collecting icons throughout the skateparks. But even if they're in the players' library of moves, they're nearly impossible to pull off because A) the commands are so damn complex, using a combination of buttons and directions on the D-pad that are far from intuitive; and B) the game doesn't register these combos every time, even if they were entered in correctly. And even when players do pull off these moves, the animations are just so crappy that the payoff just isn't there.  See, there's a reason why development companies like Vicarious Visions and Full Fat worked a polygonal character engine for their isometric extreme sports games: there's just way too many frames of animation to deal with. If anything Disney Sports Skateboarding proves this point extremely well, because the animation of each of the characters is simply pathetic. The development team had to render all four characters in eight different positions, giving them a series of moves at each of these angles. And when you're working with the limited cartridge space and VRAM of the GBA system, you're not going to get very far...and in this case the flow of each character's moves is, for lack of a better word, chunky. Good luck telling the visual difference between a ~popcorn~ and a ~rolling barrel,~ the only two standard moves each of the characters have in their list. What's worse is that the game is plagued in slowdown for no apparent reason. It just shows just how sloppily the development team treated this project. There are three other gameplay modes on top of the standard ~Trick Attack~ option, but since they all revolve around the same game engine, there's nothing rewarding about playing these modes. Disney Sports Skateboarding is just an awful game all the way through.", "date": "Jan 24, 2003"}
