The second in the series is a giant feast of racing goodness with more of everything that appeared in the first. Better graphics, better speed, more options. It's all good.  It's hard to know where to start, honestly. The game supports both analog control and dual shock feedback, and four viewpoints. The game is packed with races and enables games to choose from either sim or arcade styles  and the difference is more than noticeable. Sim is a lot less forgiving and will extend the life of the game when you have finished up with the arcade mode.  But let's set things straight. Moto Racer 2 is far and above the best motorcycle racer we've ever seen on the PlayStation (or on just about any system) because you can just pick up and go from the first second you grip the acceleration. Beginners can get right in to the groove, while real aficionados still have a relatively steep learning curve to climb. The game alerts us to the knowledge that Delphine comprehends something mysterious about intuitive design that few other developers seem to know. And the French developer has laid it out there for us to grip onto. The feel is absolutely fantastic, just like the first title. It's pure joy.   Delphine tweaked the old Moto Racer engine in this version, cranking out a faster frame rate while adding better textures and more highly detailed backgrounds and bikes. Other important info: Moto Racer is one- to two-player again, just like the first game, and in both you'll find the new environments are both visually stimulating and more stylistic in design.  But absolutely the best aspect of Moto Racer 2 is the Build-a-Course feature, which is simple, intuitive, and makes you want to create lots and lots of courses. You can store about 50 courses on a Memory Card, and they're just hella fun to make. I'll make this short and sweet. I loved the first and I love this more. Plain and simple. The frame rate is fast and maintained crisply at about 30 the entire time you race. And the feel of speed is wicked fast in any of the four perspectives, but it really kicks in the first-person perspective. Wow. Usually i don't even take that perspective because I can't far enough ahead of me on the road. In Moto Racer 2, no car roof and frame are in your way, thus in the cockpit (so to speak), you can see up ahead and still beak all of the speed limits.And then there is the analog and dual shock support. I seriously considered skipping having sex the night I discovered how good it was to drive with that. Yeah boy!Moto Racer 2, however, doesn't look that much better than the first. I honestly thought that it would look trice as good. It looks better, but not drastically.In any case, make sure to get this game, and immiately start building courses and race against your friends on them. It's a blast.", "date": "Sep 19, 1998"}
