The sequel to SingleTrac's top-selling jetbike game has finally arrived and it delivers more of the same type of action. This time, however, the handling is much improved, the physics are even more over-the-top (you can get some seriously crazy air), and the game is simply more playable.  Graphically, Jet Moto 2 is impressive. There are 10 tracks in all, and each one sports plenty of hills, jumps, twists, tunnels and turns. My favorite is the post-earthquake Los Angeles track, which really does look the part with its smashed up freeways and ruined buildings. All the courses are tight and twisting, and provide plenty of scope for exciting racing. The only complaint I have is that, although they look good, sometimes it's possible to get momentarily disoriented. It's not always clear where the sides of the track are.  Packing plenty of product placement (which is a real disappointment -- are videogame companies doing so badly that they have to plaster stuff like Mountain Dew and Butterfinger all over the bikes?), the bike design is nevertheless cool. Each handles slightly differently, so there's a high chance that one will suit your riding style. The animation of the rider is also excellent, particularly when you crash and he or she flies off. Yeah!  But it's the physics that makes this game fun. The twisting tracks have all sorts of banks, ruts and jumps, and racing is highly exciting as a consequence of that. The bike flies about everywhere, and thanks to much improved control over the original title, it's really good fun. And with the AI providing a pretty tough challenge, even veteran Jet Moto players will have their work cut out finishing all the tracks in first place.  I must say that while I enjoyed playing Jet Moto 2, for me it doesn't represent a big enough leap forward over its predecessor. It's more like Jet Moto 1.5. It's fun, it's fast and it's playable, but it's just not different enough -- I definitely had a feeling of deja vu when playing it. And because of that it fails to supply the sheer thrills and spills of games like F1 Championship Edition and V-Rally, which really do feel like cutting-edge games.
