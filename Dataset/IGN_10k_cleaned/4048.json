Time Crisis 3 arrives with plenty more of the duck-and-shoot action that fans have been waiting for. If you've been hankering for a fantastic shooting game to liven up your day, this is the one for you. Everyone else might as well stop reading now.   Still with us? Good, because Namco has outdone itself with its latest installment. Time Crisis 3 has more of the same quality action as its predecessors and throws in some new weapons to choose from to make it that much more interesting. All of this is a dead-on port from the arcade version.   The story is basically this: there's a bad guy with a moustache who wants to nuke the small country of Lukano. He's taken some hostages in order to protect himself from a major invasion by the UN, or maybe even an army. Instead, two VSSE agents get sent in to take care of business. Two agents armed with hair gel, varsity jackets, and the ability to duck behind rocks.   Gameplay  If you're just joining us, the core system for the Time Crisis series is the ducking feature. While you're ducking, nothing can hurt you and you can reload your gun. Thus, if someone's firing a missile at you, you can duck and avoid taking any damage. You can't hide forever because you have a timer constantly counting down. Spend too much time in any one section and you lose a bit of health. You can only keep moving by clearing the screen of baddies.   With the Guncon2 from Time Crisis 2, this is an extremely easy system to pick up. Push a button on the side of the gun and you duck out of the way. You can even keep your gun pointed in the same direction instead of aiming off to the side to reload like in other shooters.    If you want to play the game with the analog controller you're definitely at a slight disadvantage. This is a shooting game that needs a gun, but it's still workable to play without one. After a little practice, we were able to play almost as well, but it definitely felt better to hold the plastic gun.   The big new addition here is the variety of weapons. In addition to the regular pistol, you can fire a machine gun, a shotgun, and a grenade launcher. You start off with a little bit of ammo for each weapon, but can get more by shooting the yellow enemies that run across the screen. It adds to the game when you run into a room and choose just what weapon will work best for blowing everyone away. When a ton of tough characters fill the screen, it's satisfying to load up the grenade launcher, jump up, and blow the room to smithereens.    Just as the guys with ammo are color-coded, so is everyone else. Red guys are sureshots that should be taken out quick. Blue guys like to fire rockets or throw axes at you. Yellow and white guys need a half dozen shots to finish off. As for the green guys? Well, they're pretty much fodder. This way you can quickly scan a room and see just who you need to take out first.     The main game of Time Crisis 3 has three stages of the storyline, each with its own boss. The game is linear and happens the exact same way every time, which certainly limits the replay value, but the half hour or so it takes to finish the game is a fantastic bit of gun shooting bliss. Once again, if you like shooters, this is for you.   The storyline is cartoonish and unintentionally, we think, hilarious. Two guys whose strongest body piece of body armor are their Hawaiian shirts manage to take on an entire army of guys who are outfitted with the latest in army gear. Throw in some goofy villains, weird dialogue and you got yourself a game.   Time Crisis 3 lets you play in one or two-player mode. One player is pretty much a normal game with your computer controlled partner doing absolutely nothing but firing into space. Play with two people and it's a lot more interesting. With a split-screen mode, you have different angles on the action and can shoot different enemies at the same time. Just be careful and try to avoid shooting your partner.    Play through the game in one go and you unlock a second storyline, going through different missions as an entirely separate character. Where the main story has the two VSSE agents fighting to kill the tyrant boss, the side mission is a rescue mission to save the hostages. The main difference being that this is exclusively a single-player game. It's a little more difficult and has some extra variety by including a sniper mission where you pick off soldiers from hundreds of feet away.   Graphics  For the most part, Time Crisis 3, does a decent job with the graphics. It's nothing too fancy, but you're usually moving too fast and are too busy blowing everything up to notice. In fact, the level of detail worked out perfectly for this type of game. With so much going on, we never had any problems figuring out where to shoot.    In two-player mode there are a couple options for you. Hook up to another PS2 with an I.link and you can both play full screen. Play on one TV and each person's view gets shrunk down to one-fourth of the screen. It's certainly doable, but gets annoying after not too much time spent squinting at the screen.   Sound  The sound effects were loud and arcadey, just the way they should be. The large majority of what you'll hear are gunshots, explosions, and groans from shot soldiers. As for the music? Well, nothing too great, but nothing too terrible either. Just like the graphics, it's decent stuff, but nothing that'll distract you from the mission at hand.As shooting games go, Time Crisis 3 is a stellar example of what can be done. Unfortunately, as a shooting game, its replayability is inherently limited. It will be a lot of fun for a few hours, but will quickly grow old. Rent it with the gun if you can.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
