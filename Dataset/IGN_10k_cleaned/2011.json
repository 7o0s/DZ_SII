And over the years, I have to say that one of my favorite pieces of any of the fiction that went into the shows was the story arc in the last couple of seasons about the Dominion Wars which threw the known Star Trek universe into a huge tizzy. There were so many interesting characters, great plot twists and massive space battles that I couldn't help but be drawn into the conflict. So naturally, when I heard that there would be a PC strategy game based on the Dominion Wars, I got all geeky and excited and started running around giving people Vulcan swirlies while screaming soliloquies from Hamlet in Klingon into their ears. How could anyone go wrong with a game based on of such a great thing as the Dominion Wars? Well, I'm done with that game and I can't say I had any fun playing it. In fact, I probably had un-fun due to some really quirky controls and a severe lack of the soul that made the show so interesting.   For those that don't know about the premise, here's a quick explanation: during the very beginning of the series, it was discovered that the space station known as Deep Space Nine is sitting right on the entrance to a stable wormhole that leads to another section of the galaxy. In the exploration of what is lovingly referred to as the Gamma Quadrant, explorers run across a very militant empire known as the Dominion. The Dominion turned out to be a conglomeration of pretty much every race found in the Gamma Quadrant and soon the Alpha Quadrant (where the Federation and all of their nose ridged friends reside) is under a full scale assault from the other side of the wormhole. For the most part, the game does a very good job following some of the important points of the war from the show. Unfortunately, the game just doesn't hold the same interest as the show. It was just soulless compared to the vibrant portrayal of the situation in the show.  This is another game that just goes to show that some pretty models and nice textures just don't make a good game. When up close to any of the ship models in the game, which turned out to be much more often than anyone probably would have liked, I was genuinely impressed. The ships look like lower res versions of the show's own space-bound craft. Effects in the game are decent if not brilliant. Phasers seem a little slow to find their target at times, although that seemed to depend on the craft that was shooting them so maybe it was a little piece of Star Trek science that I don't know. Some of the environments in the game were also fairly decent, although for the most part, it's space you know. It's kinda hard to get that wrong.  Sound also was fairly decent. The effects used in the game will be pretty familiar to anyone that's watched any of the shows. Phasers firing, torpedoes launching, shields being hit, transporters being used, all of that sounds like the shows. Music in the game is fairly decent although it wasn't striking enough for me to really sit back and think, ~wow, this sounds good!~ Voice-overs in the mission briefings and the battles were fairly lifeless however. The briefings didn't get me excited to be going into battle to either crush or defend the Alpha Quadrant. The ships themselves never really give any indication whether they're being attacked or the like. No ~help I'm getting my butt kicked by a big bug looking ship!~ No ~hey look, I found a big bug looking ship and there are more coming this way, let's get 'em guys!~ Nothing to that effect at all. The most you get to tell you how things are going are a couple of lifeless computer notices telling you that something appeared on your sensors somewhere (where? who knows? I sure didn't). They didn't bother putting any personality into any of the captains to care about them dying or advancing.  So seeing as there was no personality in the game, you would like to figure that there would be a great interface and some exciting gameplay to balance all of that out. Unfortunately, you would be figuring wrong. Even after all of the patches to fix what was a horribly buggy mess at release, the game still has a bunch of problems -- weird crashes, graphical glitches, a sticky interface and a scrolling feature that barely works just to name a few. But even without the bugs, the clunky interface made the very frustrating at times, especially since there was no way to pause the game and give orders.  For a tactical strategy game, there's a sad amount of tactics or strategy to really be employed here. You see, space in the Star Trek universe is apparently on a 2D plane. We've heard the argument before that the show was like that, but I remember very distinctly that during the massive battles during the Dominion Wars, ships were definitely navigating on the Z-axis. So basically what you're reserved to in battles are a couple of different moves such as circling the enemy, jousting with the enemy, or following the enemy. Those kinds of things sound like they might be useful, but if the ships actually manage to carry out your orders, they're less likely to remember to fire weapons (the age old problem of walking and chewing gun and firing your forward phaser banks) at the same time). So really it comes down to overpowering your enemies either by numbers or by equipping your ships with special weapons and shield enhancements. There are small strategic decisions you can make like which target to attack first, but with the conspicuous absence of formations or group attack patterns that you always hear about during battles, things get boring.  The interface is a huge problem as well. There are just too many keyboard shortcuts for things that you just don't care about. Who the hell cares if picture in picture is on or off at the click of a button. Why not the different attack modes? Why not the system targeting buttons? These would have been useful. But a camera that didn't change angles every time the ship you're following moves directions, or changes zoom level every time you focus the screen on a different ship would have been much more useful. A tactical map to give orders out to various ships would have been welcome as well. As it is, you can only really keep track of what's going on in one area at a time with any kind of efficiency. Having an overview map to switch to could have solved these problems by allowing you a bigger overview map in which you could see what's going on all over the map in some detail. Hell, Homeworld did that, and that was in full 3D.  Sadly, even though I loved that part of the show, there was little in this game to recommend to anyone. If you're a diehard Star Trek fan and just have to have the newest game, don't say that I didn't warn you. This one should have been in the development studio for a while still and maybe should have been kept there forever. If I had known, I would have just let the Dominion take over so I wouldn't have had to play this.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
