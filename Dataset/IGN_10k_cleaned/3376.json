NHL Face Off has taken all of the qualities of hockey and crammed them into one great game. The 3D arena looks stunning, complete with reflecting ice and rotating advertisements. And, with the exception of the lack of players' numbers, the uniforms have been done to perfection.  NHL Face Off has gone out its way to ensure a full, realistic hockey experience. They've got one-timers, four different types of checks, slap shots, drop passes, every NHL player and team, and statistical tracking. The AI is superb, and the graphics excellent. There're even multiple camera angles that put you right in the middle of the action. The control is a little difficult at times, but that's forgivable. This is the hockey experience the PlayStation has been waiting for.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
