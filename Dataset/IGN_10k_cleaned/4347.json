However, when the game shipped last month, the response was so-so. Some said it was too hard, others said the control on console versions was poor. Regardless, Gameloft dug to port Ubi's beautiful shooter to cellphones, and the result is somewhat surprising.  Would you believe the cellphone version is actually more playable than the 3-D shooter?  Features:  Side-scrolling action Multiple weapons Serious story elements  The game begins on a beach, where an amnesiac wakes up with no clue who he is or why he's on the beach. All he knows is that there are lots of men with guns coming from him. Oh, and the news reports he shot the president. Talk about yer hang-overs. What was spelled out with great cinemas in the console game is reduced to some text in the handset, go-go rendition, but no mater. The meat of the game is the bang-bang action, not the storytelling.  As XIII, you face of with Mongose, the head dude hired to finish you off. Naturally, your goal is to escape said death sentence by returning fire against the incoming legions of troops and hired killers.  The action has been squashed from glorious 3-D  to flat, hand-drawn 2-D. For some gamers, that's an immediate reason to turn up the proverbial nose. But gamers that don't demand all-things-polygonal will find XIII to be a bright, slick little shooter that ranks up there with Gameloft's better offerings, such as Splinter Cell.  Actually, it seems that XIII owes a little DNA to Splinter Cell, as they play remarkably similar to each other. The controls are rather similar and the graphics appear to be cut from the same cloth. Now, that's no insult, as we dug Splinter. It was a fun, superspy romp with lots of guns and lots of action -- a relief from bad game show ports and Snake.  Control is nice and tight. You use the touchpad to run around. ~5~ shoots your weapon (and you have several, such as pistols, mini-guns, and assault rifles), while ~2~ jumps and ~8~ allows XIII to slide beneath low-hanging obstacles. Moving around is fluid, a welcome relief from many chuggy, clunky games out there right now.  The enemies in XIII start off rather dense. We were worried this would be a trend, but as you progress deeper into the game's seven levels, the baddies brighten up and shoot straight. You fight off various thugs, from basic footsoldiers to well-armored assassins, to helicopters that are very much not to scale. Several of the hired hands are as tall as the gunships that haunt you through many levels. Oh well, whatever. They're fun to blow up all the same.  The audio in XIII is might fine, too. There is a great opening jingle. Of course, it fades when the game starts. By now, we're all used to cell games being unable to handle action and audio, so no big whoop. Shooting bad guys really sounds nothing like tearing open flesh with a real weapon, but them's the breaks, too. XIII is a sweet, competent shooter from the good ship Gameloft, who continues to pump out surprisingly smart, solid renditions of popular console games, like Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia. The visuals are great, the control is spot-on. Really, if you're looking for a good way to blow an hour while your flight has been delayed, there are few better ways to spend your download dollars right now.", "date": "Dec 18, 2003"}
