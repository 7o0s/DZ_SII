In previous years there has been a discrepancy of up to six months between the US release of each NBA2K and when it arrives on our far-off convict shores. We spend these months reading any review we can lay our hands on and play the game vicariously through the forum posts of our American cousins. Thankfully Santa came early this year and brought a sack full of next-gen basketball goodness for lucky Xbox360 owners.   On first impressions we can't help but contrast NBA2K7 to the original Lakers vs. Celtics from the late eighties. It's amazing how far technology has advanced in this time, but despite the presentation of NBA2K7 being a world apart from LvsC's pixilated EGA sprites, one element remains consistent. Both games live or die on the strength of their gameplay, and here 2K7 manages to achieve what has been the stumbling block for many recent sports titles. It transcends its shiny exterior to reveal a well-balanced basketball simulation that is both accurate and incredibly enjoyable.   When the 2K series first appeared on the Dreamcast it raised the bar in terms of gameplay and presentation, but its evolution to the current console generation felt slightly stagnant and many reverted back to NBA Live, or found greener pastures with Microsoft's under-rated Inside Drive franchise. 2K7 has taken the opportunity to step-up with the Xbox360 and delivered an excellent package that combines outstanding gameplay, impressive presentation and a robust online component.   Close ups like this don't take place often enough for our liking.  It's difficult to spot any faults in the solid gameplay, but depending on your style you may find some aspects not quite up to the high standard set by the rest of the game. A lot of the way we play the game is based around the post, and while the players always set up correctly the passing animation often draws them out of position leaving you posting-up just inside the three point line. This is generally not ideal. Another issue that occasionally raises its ugly head is the lack of a quick or one-touch pass. You'll be hitting the post again (a trend?) and before the receiving player has the ball you'll spy the double team coming, leaving someone open under the basket. At this point we want to be able to tap pass and quickly dish the rock, but there always seems to be a second or so delay that gives the defense time to recover.   While not a fault as such, it is extremely difficult to play defense on the ball. With such an array of dribbling moves available via the IsoMotion system it seems that common human reflexes simply aren't able to keep up. Some may consider it poor form, but controlling the centre on defence generally avoids the need to defend IsoMotion and you can creep over to fill the lane if needed. The defensive pressure setting provides great control over how closely your defenders play the ballhandler, and their tendencies to double team, so if you are having trouble on your half of the court perhaps give this a try. AI players rarely get their match-ups wrong, but once they do it is nearly impossible to switch back.    The menu navigation system is far from intuitive, but once you realise what Visual Concepts have done it makes a little more sense. It's more of a floating menu, so any time outside of actual game play you can tap the right stick to bring up the main menu as an overlay. This makes it almost instantly accessible and removes load times while you skip back to a main menu to get to another game mode. This sounds good in theory, but takes a bit of time to get used to. Not helping the matter is that many of the option menus are a little too segregated for our liking. Once you finish tuning a particular option list you're forced to start at the very top of the menu navigation hierarchy, rather than return to the previously viewed menu.   We've already mentioned how good NBA2K7 looks. The player models aren't quite up to the high standard of Fight Night Round 3, but their textures and lighting are easily on par. The uniform cloth flows freely, and on close inspection appears to even have a stitch texture that contrasts against the satiny reflection of the player number. Stadiums are authentically recreated and the courts really have to be seen to be believed, particularly the reflective flare from the stadium jumbo-tron. We may feel silly for saying this in a few years, but it is practically life-like.   Motion capture is of a very high quality, and the player's feet appear to actually be interacting with the ground rather than the running on the spot look that past games have failed to avoid. However, the contact between the player's hands and the ball isn't quite as solid; it often looks like the ball is floating on a cushion of air in the player's grip. Most of the NBA's star players have their shooting styles modeled to great effect. At the regular gameplay zoom levels you may not be able to distinguish certain players based on appearance alone, but this feature makes them instantly recognisable.    Jaw-dropping visuals are the order of the day.  The innovative shot stick from 2K6 is back, but has been tweaked to make it slightly more useful. You won't want to use it for jump shots, but it gives you a great deal more control under the basket or on the break. Tapping left or right will force your player into a layup on that respective side of the basket, whereas the right trigger modifier changes the stick to a dunk selector for regular, power, reverse or showboat styles. When it works, it works well, but we've had some troubles using it under the basket rather than on a drive or fastbreak.   Online is the best place to appreciate NBA2K7, as the offline experience has been almost seamlessly replicated. 2KSports has provided both beginner and advanced lobbies, and a preferred player rating (similar to that of the generic Xbox Live rating), giving your opponents the opportunity to rate your sportsmanship. While the developers have included constraints to keep online play fair, such as not being able to permanently double-team a player, they have included a ridiculous free throw distraction feature which gives your opponent the opportunity to make the entire screen shake like a nine on the Richter scale. This is especially annoying as the free throw mechanics are based on recognising a very small visual cue, and is an unexpected deviation from the simulation tone of the rest of the game. As with most Live titles you should try and stick with domestic competition though, as poor network performance will cripple the game's framerate.   The Association is 2K7's version of a dynasty mode, and offers some great new additions to the formula. Three team trades are now possible, giving you a lot more options to secure a superstar or offload a crippling contract. Players now exhibit progressive fatigue, so back-to-back games become more of a challenge as you need to manage your court time more carefully so as not to tire your stars. The annual release of sports games is becoming increasingly tiring, but Visual Concepts has obviously worked hard to ensure that this years offering raises the bar for sports simulation. NBA2K7 offers beautiful visuals built on top of extremely focused gameplay, all of which translates perfectly into the online game. Provided that roster updates are maintained and the online infrastructure is well supported, 2K7 could be the best basketball game since the 2K series was launched.", "date": "Nov 15, 2006"}
