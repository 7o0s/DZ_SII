Pretend this is just a videogame for a moment. Get yourself in the mood for a strange kind of innocence. When you're through to the other side, and can play Grand Theft Auto with a clear mind, you're going to have to admit to yourself, sooner or later, that there's nothing quite like Grand Theft Auto. Here, it's fun to be bad.  The game that pushed the limits of what's good, clean videogame fun has made its journey from the land of the PC to the PlayStation, and we can thankfully say that it's journey has been worthwhile. In the single-player Grand Theft Auto, gamers take on the role of a low-level gangster, who's helping out the mob boss with minor tasks of thievery, drug dealing, and the sort.   Your job is often very simple. Get from point A to point B. Fortunately, there's a lot of random fun to attain in the process, such as running over innocent civilians, stealing cars, beating unsuspecting people to a pulp, throwing other out of cars, shooting lots of similar type bad folks senseless, and we're just getting started. From there, your tasks increase in difficulty, and cops get angrier as do rival gangs.  This game offers eccentric pleasures. In addition to stealing and indulging your criminal vices to the maximum, you can steal just about every car in the game. Each one drives different, too. Try to pick out the Porsches and the convertibles if you can, they drive the fastest. Also, random people will fight back, or not let you into their cars.  Grand Theft Auto reminds me of the simplistic arcade games that ravaged the earth about 20 years ago. It's simple, fun, and carefree gaming. It's also got graphics from about 20 years ago, too. The overall look of the game is really quite shoddy for an age of such grandiose special effects and 3D realism.   One such example of the graphic look starts at your main character, who is barely identifiable from any other pedestrian. The top-down view is generally stable and seamless, but occasionally, it zooms in too close, leaving you unclear as to where a car or opponent might be; the camera view is often blocked by buildings. In some cases, the camera zooms right up to the top of a building, instead of zooming right in.  The graphic problems, however, aren't really such a problem, because, really, this game could be playable with a simple vector graphics engine and still be fun. But Grand Theft Auto isn't about graphics. Rather, the graphics are a symptom of  fast-food programming and careless design. Why can't I tell when my hoodlum is facing one way or the other? If there was just an ounce more detail, or focus, then that problem would've been solved. Other little troublesome details are the less-than-splendid controls, which bring you to the point of wanting to re-start. If you park a car too close to a building, that car is now worthless. You can't get back into it. Instead, you're forced to search out another car.  There are other problems, too, like the overall slow movement of your character, the low frame rate, and the often unidentifiable objects you're supposed to pick up or attain. These aspects are only worth noting because they game would be more fun and have more replay value if they were fixed, polished, altered, modified, etc.   So, this game, as you can tell, isn't for the graphic tart, the mipp-mapping pimp, or the 3Dfx slut. Nope. It's for people who get a little high from feeling slightly indecent. It's really kind of a personality thermometer -- you can tell just by watching your friends' reaction as to whether they're of 'loose moral values,' or if they are uptight squares.  Grand Theft Auto is a fun game, but you may find yourself saying to yourself outloud, ~Hey, why didn't they fix that?~ Not a good sign for a game that has so much potential.
