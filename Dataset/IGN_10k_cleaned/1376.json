Starting with NFL Blitz, and following with games such as Hydro Thunder, and now the sequel to Ready to Rumble, gamers get to revel in hilarious, light-hearted sports and action games that are easy to pick up and play, and filled with extras, bonuses, and secrets.   Ready to Rumble is a perfect example of Midway's arcade abilities. It's also the exact reason that games like these have a two-year lifespan. People will buy this kind of game maybe twice before they realize that along with light, arcade play there is always no gameplay depth. Ready to Rumble: Round 2 is a solid sequel to last year's game, with lots of improvements, and changes made to better the gameplay, but it hasn't really changed that equation a bit.   Gameplay Ready to Rumble made its debut on N64 and Dreamcast last year, followed by the PlayStation version. For anyone familiar with Round 1, Round 2 plays exactly like the first. Players have low and high punches, lefts and rights, and they can attack with combinations, and flurries, once they spell out the word RUMBLE. Just like last year, to spell out RUMBLE, players need to land serious blows to the opponent. In this version, players are given a few new treats that round off many of last year's flaw-riddled game. To start, players earn three levels of RUMBLE, each one setting off a different flurry. The third time you spell it, the letters turn white and once you connect with the opponent, he or she will literally fly out of the ring, summersaulting into the stands.   Of course, one of the game's most entertaining qualities is the lineup of characters, and most of last year's characters have returned. There are also nearly 30 characters in all, a hefty addition to last year's roster. First time favorites such as Rocket Sanchez, Lulu Valentine, Afro Thunder, Jet ~Iron~ Chin, Mama Tua, Boris ~The Bear~ Knockimov, and almost all of the others are here in the best looking form on any system.   But what makes this version so mainstream friendly, so very celebrity cool, so funky fresh, is the inclusion of real live celebrities. Back from Wonderland is the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, along with the NBA's current MVP and the Lakers' star center, Shaquille O'Neal. Both appear as opponents in the ring, and eventually become playable characters, once you have unlocked them. I gotta tell you, playing as Michael Jackson is both very weird and strangely satisfying. It's just stupid fun to hear him yell, ~Rumble!~  cause he has such a high, kiddy, girly voice. It's also goofy fun to see him perform his trademark moves  and the moonwalk  when he's finished a fight. Oh yeah, his white glove? It's there, wrapped around the glove.   Shaq is cool, too, and I am an old Laker's fan, so it's neat to have him in the game, but he doesn't translate that well into a videogame character. I mean, I'm not sure if he just doesn't have strong enough facial characteristics, or what, but he looks generic. In any case, whether he looks like himself or not, one thing is for sure  he's extremely powerful, has some deadly combos, and he has a long, long reach. Hey, hey, Midway isn't dumb! Shaq has to be the man.   There are also certain political figures who appear, and let's see, they happen to live in the white house...Hmmm... Also, I have to throw this in because of the sheer hilarity of it all  the new Canadian character -- Freak E. Deke? He's a stroke genius. I love that freak. This is what makes Ready to Rumble so endearing  its funny, loveable, ridiculous characters.   Most of the loose ends appear to have been sewed up in Round 2. Taking note of last year's incredibly easy Exhibition mode, in which you could bet the house and 99% of the time win all of the money, or in Training mode, wherein you could simply cheat by choosing automatic, or in Career mode, in which you could win by simply fighting with the same few punches over and over again, Midway has made a few changes. First, if you choose to have a Career, you land a gym named after yourself, and you get to train in it. In this mode, players follow a schedule of Championship and Exhibition fights, each staggered throughout months in the year, so that they must train in between the fights to build up their vitals. Players build up aspects such as strength, endurance, power, speed, etc., to contend against the more powerful opponents. But if you loose more than three championship fights, you loose the gym and have to start all over again. Other worthwhile modes include Arcade and Tournament.   Ready to Rumble: Round 2 is a classic example of a good, light, arcade game that is now more well rounded than ever before. It's fun for a few hours, and maybe a few days, depending on your experience with videogames. This game is sure to draw in the newcomers, casual gamers, and the families, but it's not going to quell the thirst of the experienced vet.   Graphics The first game looked great, and this one looks even better. Because of the style of the characters  the over-the-top, big faced, weirdly proportioned men and women that star in Round 2 can't look bad. I mean, first of all, whether you like the game or not, the character design is very good indeed. In Round 2, the characters look better than on any other system.   Nearly mastered in the first game, Midway has perfected the art of molding hinge sections of the body without a gap in Round 2, otherwise known as ~softskinning.~ Elbows, knees, waists and other jointed parts blend incredibly well together without a single seam showing.   Another interesting graphic feature is the opening movie. While the actual movies in the game are crude and unsightly, the opening movie in Round 2 is cool, a creatively designed collage of fighters, selected scenes, and quick takes. Much like the feeling created by the PS's WWF in Attitude, Round 2 creates a strong feeling with its first movie.   Sound ~Let's get ready to rumble!~ -- The opening song is still as catchy as ever, although it's definitely overused. And Michael Buffer once again appears in each round to give you his officially overused and overly expensive line. He also appears as an opponent monster character in one of the levels, and it's quite cool to see him transform and play. You just have to beat the Arcade mode to find out just how he looks.   As in the first game, the voices for each character in Round 2 are almost always funny, appropriate and tailored to the peculiarity of that character. The new cowboy character sounds strangely familiar to anyone who knows Andrew Hoolan (former Midway employee who rocked the house), Freak E. Deke is a scream, and Afro Thunder is as over the top as ever (~It's time to dance, it's time to dance!~). The punching and knockout sounds are also wonderfully exaggerated and likeable, too. Overall, the sound department gets high scores all around.   Ready to Rumble: Round 2 is a nice sequel to the first game, and it's fun to play for about four hours. Once you have played through it with a bunch of characters, though, you really don't need to play it again. This one is strictly for newbies and casual gamers.

And hey, I did have fun playing as Michael Jackson and Shaquille O'Neal, but neither were as fun as Freak E. Deke. Too bad this game is as shallow as a kiddy pool.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
