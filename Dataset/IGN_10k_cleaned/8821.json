For every Tiger wanna-be, there is an Anti-Tiger. So is Nintendo's Golf just one of those niche games that will appeal to only driver-happy die-hards? Perish the thought. Even if you had a disastrous first outing on the links and vowed never to return, you might still find yourself lured back to the roughs and greens by this well-designed and addictive golf simulation.   Features  Single-player or Two-player with the Game Boy Game Link (sold separately). Best scores saved; two players can have their best scorecards saved. Auto-save at each hole or interrupt save. Two different courses. Excellent game control. Difficulty level: MEDIUM.   The Game Welcome to golf, Mario style. Before you troll the links, you have your choice of two distinctly different courses: Japanese or American. The Japanese course is the easier of the two, offering moderate winds, navigable roughs, and gently-sloping greens. If you've never played golf before and have no clue what any of these terms mean, don't sweat it. The game comes with a highly detailed manual that will break in even the most naive golfer. The American course, on the other hand, would intimidate even Jack Nicklaus. Horrendous ten-mile-an-hour winds (often against you), more rough than fairway, and bumpy greens are all part of this challenging course. The type of challenge you are looking for will determine which course you choose. Each course features eighteen holes, some long, some short. A scorecard automatically records your shots on each hole.   One of the game's better features is the detailed information available to you on each of your shots. The screen shows you wind direction and speed, the position of your ball on the lie, the distance to the hole, and the type of club you've selected. The play screen also gives you a shot indicator that allows you to gauge how hard you hit the ball and whether you slice it (hit it rightward), hook it (hit it leftward), or slam it straight and true. You can also toggle from a course overview to a view of the green, where arrows show the degrees of how steep the slope is.   The two-player mode included is a nice touch and offers excellent competitive opportunities. In fact, it is most likely Golf's nicest feature as it takes the playing challenge to an entirely new level.    Graphics: Golf is simply and effectively rendered. The fairways are easily distinguishable from the roughs, while the sand traps differ noticeably from the lakes. The amusing animated reactions of Mario and his caddy to great shots like birdies, eagles, and holes-in-one are a nice incentive to the player to give each shot special consideration. In two-player mode, you'll take great satisfaction in winning a hole and watching your distraught opponent throw a tiny tantrum. And of course, if you shoot the lowest score and become '# 1', you'll be lavished with attention and gifts from an adoring throng of groupies. Overall the animations are excellent and add to the innocent simplicity of the game.    The music is jaunty and upbeat, but otherwise forgettable. It exists only during the opening and closing sequences of the game and wisely retreats during those hush-hush moments of setting up a shot.   Sound effects are enjoyable and add realism to the vicarious golfing experience. When the ball scratches to a landing in a sand trap, or plops helplessly into the water, you can't help but feel your stomach tighten just a little. And when you hear the satisfying sound of the ball clunking into the cup or whizzing as it clears a patch of out of bounds territory, the elation felt is almost embarrassing. Such is the magic of simple sounds creating a big sensory impact.    The endless challenge of beating the current best score is alone incentive enough to return again and again to this excellent simulation. Add to that the wide selection of shot techniques and ever changing course conditions and you have a game that never wears out its welcome. And don't forget the superior two-player feature, which will convince you to polish up on your putts in order to avoid public humiliation.  Golf will not earn you any million dollar endorsement deals for Big Bertha or Nike, but it will provide an extremely entertaining and relatively cheap golfing experience. Nowadays, twenty bucks will barely rent you a cart on a real course. Save your money and buy instead a cart that is truly worth the expense -- Nintendo's Golf is an above par experience.
