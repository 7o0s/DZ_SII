Pity me, folks.  In all seriousness, I tried to play this one in the privacy of my own home to avoid ridicule from co-workers  unfortunately, I found myself having some free time at the office in which to play Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy for review today. And guess what. Not ten minutes went by before the first of the finger-pointed-laughing commenced. I was a bit embarrassed, sure...but let them laugh. The game is surprisingly fun, despite the cringingly sweet subject. Gameplay  Judging from the package, NewKidCo is aiming for the young girl market  and believe me when I say that there isn't much out there on the PlayStation for that demographic. NewKidCo specializes in titles like Elmo's Letter Adventure and Elmo's Number Journey  two titles which would be nigh-impossible for a game site to review. But this is different. There's no education to speak of in Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy  it's a puzzle game in the same vein as Tetris or Lost Vikings. In fact, that's the best way to describe the game  by mushing those two classics together into a single PlayStation disc.  The idea is simple: guide Hello Kitty around the playfield to collect icons  collect all the icons, and you've cleared the level. While you're not in complete control of Hello Kitty, you can tell her to walk or run to the left or right via the L and R buttons on the controller. She'll climb up single blocks in her way, but walk the other way when there are more than that. She'll also act like a Lemming by falling off edges  so be careful, since she'll stun herself if she falls too far. It's not deadly, but she'll be out of commission for a few seconds after a particularly nasty fall.  While you tell Hello Kitty to run left and right, blocks fall from the top of the screen of different colors. They'll fall as one, two, three or four blocks in formation, and you have the ability to rotate the formation as they fall. Moving the joypad will move the blocks. The idea is to make ~staircases~ for Hello Kitty to climb so she can reach the icons she needs to collect. Linking three or more blocks of the same color will cause them to disappear  both helpful and a hindrance. Once a stack of blocks disappear, other blocks nestle into place. Problem is, there really doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for how far the extra blocks will fall. This little element really makes for some seriously annoying gameplay.  One more factor to take into account  the other characters, like Badtz-Maru (a cranky penguin), Pandaba (a big-headed panda) and Hanamaru (a seal?). These guys will try to make it more difficult for Hello Kitty to pick up her icons. Badtz-Maru will get pissed off every time Hello Kitty picks up an icon, and kick the nearest block  causing others to fall. Pandaba gets equally upset, but she'll rotate four cubes 90 degrees. Hanamaru just walks around, getting in your way.  All in all, it's an interesting design. It's no Tetris classic, but there's some likable gaming to be had here. Graphics  The whole game takes place in the standard resolution, in a 2D environment. There's really no 3D to be had here, other than a few rendered images of Hello Kitty in between levels and the FMV introduction. It's very colorful, but very basic. There's no reason why this game couldn't be done on the Color Game Boy. Sound  During the game, you'll here very upbeat, traditional Japanese videogame music. I hate to admit it, but many of the music pieces are rather toe-tapping. Hell, some of the background music reminds me of the awesome music in Nights: Into Dreams for the Sega Saturn. But to balance it all out, there has to be annoying sound effects  there's not much in this game, other than an extremely overblown fanfare every time you pick up an icon.   All right, yuck it up. It was one of the low-points of my editorial career to be handed this game for review. I had to make sure no one was watching me when I popped this disc into the PlayStation. How the hell was I going to explain myself, playing a game with Hello Kitty plastered all over it...But after a good 15 minutes, I really got into it. Sure, it's no Tetris, but it's unique enough to have some fun. But honestly, I've got a reputation to keep -- I'm not going to subject myself to ridicule playing this game in public. I'll be playing this game in the privacy of my own apartment, thank you very much...Hey, I like a good puzzle game as much as the next guy. But if you decide to pick it up, don't let anyone see you.", "date": "Apr 29, 1999"}
