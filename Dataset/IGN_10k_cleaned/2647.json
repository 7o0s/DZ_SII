If, by chance, you happen to be unfortunate enough to pick it up under the false pretense that it was about the supple mammary glands of the female of the species and intense racing, you will be sorely disappointed. If, by chance, you manage to overcome plaguing compatibility issues, you will be sorely disappointed. If, by chance, you manage to contend with sloppy control and repetitious play, you will be sorely disappointed. I suppose then in retrospect Road Trip is not so much a game of chance, but rather a game of sore disappointment, a game that should be fined for false advertising.   Featuring neither enough the way of boobies or racing, Hooters is but a box with a shallow plastic disc enclosed. Only hardcore masochists who delight off playing other drabble like Varmint Hunter need apply. But don't worry, you hapless consumers suckered into a purchase. Contently know that despite whatever else that can be said about this game, it is the official road trip of Hooters. Official! No cheap knock off here. No sir, it legally taints the good Hooters name, copyright and all.  Hooters is a title that lives by the adage of gameplay before graphics... Horrified by its profound ugliness, most people will immediately reel back in disgust even if they are just passing by and happen to peripherally glance it in action for but a moment. Shying away from the monitor in disbelief they'd say,   ~This can't be a real game. It hurts my eyes. A real game wouldn't hurt my eyes.~  To its credit, Road Trip is a very accurate representation of the PSX version it was ported from. That's right, all the goodness of low resolution everything, under developed everything, and choppy everything made the transition from console to PC unscathed. A far more considerate beast than its console cousin could ever hope to be, Hooters PC provides for high, middle, and low graphical settings. They all equate to poorly performing crap. Yes, great is the difference between terrible textures and blurred and bland ones. I liken it to choosing between a Yugo, Gremlin and Pinto. Regardless of what the final decision is, ultimately you'll be motoring a slow, dangerous, ugly piece of crap that breaks down all the time and is quite likely to explode at random intervals. No matter, what Hooters lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in innovative gameplay, such as the new variable and confounding framerate. Only the most skilled of players will be able to adjust their eyes to accommodate the sporadic clip. One minute it could chug along at seven frames per second and the next it could be at fifty. That's difficulty. And we thought dealing with loose and unforgiving controls was hard enough. Enjoy spinning out all the time? Rejoice!  Hooters is a game of aural delights. Delightful you will be when the ~music~ and audio cease playing. Allowing players to swap out the game coaster (CD) with a music one of their own is a kind thought (for some reason I can't dig country crap rockers with perms), but not a redeeming one. If it's true that noisy vacuums sooth children into sleeping, then the sound of Road Trip will put them into a coma. For the rest of us, mute will be soon be a cherished word.   When not leaving skid marks or basking in the wonder of this sometimes amazing interactive slideshow, players will find that Road Trip is a game of traffic. Moving from point A to point B isn't that difficult of a task, but doing it amidst tightly packed unyielding motorists and pushy competitors is. Like all good traffic racers, dynamic play and ever-present competition are sung loud and clear. Intense, engaging, and wickedly fast, traffic racers are my most favorite subsection of the greater racing genre. To some very small degree, Hooters is a respectable outing in this category. Confined roads, like those between Atlanta and New Orleans involve bobbing, weaving, reflex, and skill. Jump medians, split semis, overtake on the outside... Oh yeah, it's all here, just not without a slew of totally debilitating faults that bring everything down well below acceptable levels of playability. Crashing in tight spaces means reappearing and getting hit a few dozen times. Hell, crashing at all means flipping into the air like crazy. Sure, there are physics settings, but this is like saying one is ridiculously arcadey and the other is really ridiculously arcadey. This game does not ~Simulate hard-driving action.~ Konami's Midnight Run and EA's Need For Speed 3DO, as old and severely dated as they are, remain far better traffic racers than this (in virtually every single respect too).   Six rallies with two to seven stages in each comprise all that Hooters has to offer. Go from Ft. Lauderdale to Raleigh, or from Ft. Lauderdale to Jacksonville, or from Ft. Lauderdale to Phoenix, or even from Ft. Lauderdale to Santa Monica... Are we starting to see a pattern developing here? If not, allow me to elaborate, every rally (group of races) forces you to first do the races from earlier rallies before you can move on to the new race of that rally. Repetition to the max. Thankfully, the generally horrible track design is consistent. Consistency can technically be seen as a quality (sort of).  All 16 of the game's cars are fictitious. Even though nothing can really compete with the joys of brand naming (seeing ~Daewoo Laganza~ in a game is just too cool), Road Trip does give us a clever selection of cars all complete with useless statistics. Can't decide between a Plow-200, Cuva, Pantea, or Fugo? Check the wheel base and weight, because it really matters.    All of the above is based on the assumption that you are actually able to play. The game crashes so much that I opened the read me and under 'known issues,' expected to find ~Playing.~  Which Hooters girl is your favorite?  Most important of all, Hooters Road Trip delivers no Hooters. Blasphemous! Tempting players with the promise of hooters, and a party with Hooters, and then providing brief video clips with little to no pay off is very, very aggravating (I still love you Miss Long Beach). Yes, there is a bit of FMV to be found: each city is briefly introduced by a girl and we get 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winner clips and one overall ending video (driving around in California -- cool because we haven't seen that before). Aside from the finale, every video is a sorry three to seven seconds long (or thereabouts). Worse, I couldn't even find a place to go back and view the videos that I had unlocked. Not that it mattered, their sheer suckiness made sure of that. Still, the girls are pretty and nice. See...     I'm not keen on the objectification of women. I despise it greatly. The era of the midriff and pop music that, God bless it, insists on incorporating lewd and demeaning sexual references in every single song and television show, is contaminating our youth (me), making them believe that a tight tummy and kept pubic line are of greater importance than personal well being, dignity, intelligence, strength, compassion...virtue.I see this, and like any ~good~ person, refrain from partaking in its many sinful delights as best I can. But I'm no idiot and I'm no hypocrite. I'm a male who, like every other with an eye for attractive girls, will consistently cave into the all powerful demands of genetics, wants, desires, and needs inherent with the race of man. Will is fleeting when perfume is strong. I see a pretty girl and I smile. I see a pretty and scantily clad girl and supple breasts and I smile, my curiosity and interest piqued. Hooters knows this, hence the restaurant's immense, rightful and honest success. They hide behind nothing. People pay good money for good food served by well-endowed women. Hooters Road Trip also knows sex sells. But make no mistake, this game is deceitful.Road Trip is a horrid, wretched, abysmal excuse for a racer that comes wrapped in a pretty but see-through package. Of course, nothing can touch the supreme delight of knowing, loving, and fearing girls in real life, but even if you must seek lustful gratification through intangible outlets, seek it elsewhere. Three to seven second clips of smiling and chipper females intersperse hours of painful and ugly gameplay that will damage your psyche and hurt your eyes.In a nutshell: even at objectifying women and relying solely on their wafting sex appeal to excel, Road Trip fails miserably. Because of that, the game must rely on play to justify its existence. Too bad it can't even begin to compete with titles from nearly a decade ago.Want pretty girls happy to be exploited? Turn on MTV.
