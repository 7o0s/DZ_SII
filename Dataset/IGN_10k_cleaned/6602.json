Instead of providing ~hardcore~ thrills for the traditional gamer-set, LimeLife endeavors to craft more soothing, relaxing applications that reward skill, but don't stress the gamer with things like artificial time limits. It's an interesting angle, and after viewing both of the firm's initial salvos, including Girls Night Out Solitaire, I can honestly say I appreciate the approach even if the games themselves don't exactly blow my hair back with originality.   Solitaire is the ultimate casual game -- it requires little explanation to anybody old enough to wield a game-capable cellphone. The Girls Night Out branding dresses the most elemental of card games up with a crew of sassy compatriots that offer encouragement while you play, as well as dish gossip when the ~action~ lulls. It's almost like playing cards with the cast of ~The View.~ For some, that would be a total turn-off. It certainly was for me after a while, because the last thing I need to see when trying to clear a suite is one of my girls telling me that some woman named Char got lucky last night. Please, girlfriend, like I care. Talk to the hand.   Fortunately, the girls can be sent packing after a quick trip to the options menu. This doesn't completely banish them, as they will pop up on menu screens or when you start one of the card game variations. And that's fine. Unobtrusive chatter doesn't bother me. But then again, consider that I am not considered LimeLife's target audience. Perhaps the running commentary will amuse you more than me.   GNO offers two different solitaire variations -- both are classic, but you can opt for either one card or three card turns when you access the deck. LimeLife also includes a pair of matching games that rely on memorization to win. These are easy-breezy additions that I bet users will only check out once or twice. I wish the time had been taken instead to include another game play mode on top of classic klondike, matching, and freecell.   The controls in GNO are very simple to use -- you can use only the thumb pad to manipulate the cards, but the game also offers a number key method that is just as easy  (maybe even easier) as using your thumb. Each column is assigned a number, as is the deck and the wells. Just bouncing your thumb around the number keys is enough to plow through a game with little difficulty.   GNO also offers the option to only play with solvable decks. When I first started playing the game, I was unaware of this option. After winning a few games in a row, I was wondering if LimeLife had sacrificed ease-of-play for challenge. Turning it off, I started losing games -- like you're supposed to. However, the ~solvable deck~ option is a good addition and helps the game succeed under the company mission. You can sit down, blow through a game, and just enjoy yourself rather than fret about ruining the deck by misplacing just... one... card.  Girls Night Out is a fine card game package, but I wish it had a few more options. The ~Girls Night Out~ part of the experienced grated on me, but it can be turned off if the chatter annoys you, too. The solvable deck option is a nice addition that allows the user to customize the experience depending on whether they want some light entertainment or want a quick challenge. I think the target audience, women looking for something fun to play that doesn't require a huge thumb workout, will be satisfied with GNO provided they don't already have a solitaire game on their handsets.", "date": "Feb 7, 2006"}
