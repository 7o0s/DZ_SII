One of the common threads that runs through nearly every religious belief system in history is the idea of a second chance at life, or at least consciousness and experience.  It only makes sense, after all, given our fear of losing the one chance we have, that the main reason we'd turn to a belief in the supernatural is to assure ourselves that this isn't it - that we'll have another shot at getting it right, moving on to bigger and better things.  We of the modern West may be miserable violent bastards, but we tend to feel a little guilty about that, at least in our better moments - hence the peaceful afterlives of Christianity and the other religions of the Book.  The Norse peoples of Scandinavia, however, who held sway back in the rougher days between around the fifth and tenth centuries, had somewhat different ambitions for their second lives.  A worthwhile life entailed many long years of kicking hell and taking names, and if you were tough enough in this one, your reward in the next life was a chance to wreak even more havoc, as a warrior in the armies of the Aesir gods.  That's the myth that Valkyrie Profile draws its inspiration from, the basis of Enix's strikingly original return to the American RPG scene.  According to the legend, worthy souls are collected at their death by Valkyries, the warrior maidens of the preeminent god Odin.  So chosen and found fitting, they travel to Odin's hall at Valhalla and await the end of the world, Ragnarok, where they will go forth and fight the last battle of all.  Tri-Ace, the game's developers (made famous by the Star Ocean series) plays a little fast and loose with the conventions of Norse mythology, though.  According to their telling of the tale, many more than just valiant warriors have a chance to become Einherjar, divine warriors, and the Valkyrie is not quite so simple a figure as an emissary of death.  Their warriors have lived all sorts of lives, and died as many deaths.  The breadth and depth of its cast, and the fascination of exploring the stories and mysteries behind them, are perhaps foremost among the qualities that make Valkyrie Profile such an engrossing RPG.  But while its story, or rather stories, are enough of a draw in their own right, it also happens to be one of the most gorgeous 2D creations I've ever seen, and possessed of such original game systems that even veteran RPG'ers might find themselves at sea for a little while.  For years, back in the days of the NES and SNES, there were two great names in console role-playing games - Enix and Square.  If the newly-minted Enix of America can continue the streak that it's started with Valkyrie, there will again be competition for the creators of Final Fantasy.  Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX are among the best games released this year, and you should certainly play them, but it would be a shame if you missed Valkyrie Profile because of it.  It's as involving an RPG experience, and perhaps even more innovative in its game and scenario design.  Gameplay  The leading role in Profile is the eponymous Valkyrie, Lenneth, charged by Odin with the task of training new Einherjar in anticipation of the coming Ragnarok.  As Lenneth, you are brought down into the human world of Midgard, given a brief introduction to the mechanics of combat and exploration by the goddess Freya, and then, all of a sudden, you are cast adrift to make your own way for a surprisingly long section of the game.  To begin with, you see, Valkyrie Profile does not have any kind of linear quest.  There isn't a plot to push you from destination to destination.  Instead, for most of the first disc, it follows an anthology structure that might be a little familiar to those who've played Legend of Mana.  While Lenneth hovers over the 3D world map, she can attune herself to the presence of malevolent undead or a dying warrior - in other words, an action or story sequence.  Head to the indicated destination, and you'll battle your way through a dungeon full of monsters or watch the tale of another individual soul unfold.  These scenes occur in a roughly organized random sequence.  The game as a whole is divided into eight Chapters, each composed of 24 Periods.  The mathematically minded will then come up with the total figure of 192 Periods, which count down until the final battle.  That's the time that Lenneth has to complete her task and unlock the mystery of her own origin, time which is consumed by the actions you perform.  Visiting a location, whether it's to collect a warrior, fight a battle, or simply explore an unfamiliar place, consumes a certain number of Periods, and so you can only do so much in any given Chapter and the game as a whole.    Thus, your task is given immediacy at any point by the time-limit in the Chapter.  Each Chapter has a fixed set of events that may happen in it, and which only happen in that Chapter - if you finish a Chapter without meeting a particular character or uncovering a particular dungeon, you won't be able to encounter that element of the game in that particular playthrough (more on that later).  However, the game is lent a strong nonlinearity by the fact that they don't necessarily happen in the same order every time you go through any given Chapter.  This, in combination with your ability to visit past destinations, gives you a remarkable degree of freedom to explore the world and encounter different locales and personalities.  Once you've been to a particular place and met an Einherjar there, you can and should go back to revisit them.  You'll often trigger extra story sequences that flesh out the past and personalities of the characters, and occasionally pick up a useful item in the bargain.  You can also explore dungeons you've previously visited and delve deeper into them, finding treasures you missed or just building up the levels of your characters.  You can revisit locations in multiple playthroughs - Valkyrie Profile definitely rewards multiple trips through the game, with more than one ending and a great deal of branching to the progression of dungeons and character sequences.  Thanks to the nonlinear progression in each Chapter, it gives you plenty to see the second time through, which is a major asset in any RPG.  The variable difficulty settings are another key to its replay value.  You can pick Easy, Medium, or Hard in the beginning of the game, and those settings influence far more than just the difficulty of battle sequences.  Hard mode actually opens up more of the game to you, allowing you to experience more dungeons and characters, and in contrast, Easy mode simplifies dungeon maps and other elements as well as simple battles.  In the early going, though, you'll probably focused on the immediate task of building your characters.  Lenneth is charged with collecting worthy souls, training them, and sending them to Valhalla.  In game terms, you discover new characters in the story sequences, fight with them through dungeons to build up their levels and skills, and then use the Transfer system to send them up.  I've explained before how these systems interlock, but it's worth looking the situation over again.  Each character, beyond their basic physical statistics, is also possessed of Traits and Skills, measurements of their personal qualities and special capabilities.  These influence how they perform during combat - developing Skills improves character statistics and allows them to perform all different kinds of special maneuvers - but they're also important when it comes time to send them to Valhalla.  During each Chapter, you can and must send up a certain number of soldiers, according to requirements delivered to you by Freya.  They have to have certain strengths in their Traits and Skills, or they won't be effective warriors - they may even be killed in the wars of the gods.  If this seems complicated, it is.  Managing the development of a party full of characters, their experience, equipment, skills, and traits, is an extremely tall order, especially early in the game when you're first trying to get the hang of things.  However, once you master the character development system, an amazing amount of depth reveals itself.  Building characters' skill sets is at least as significant a factor as increasing their basic experience levels, and working towards the simultaneous end of creating a powerful character in combat and training a well-rounded Einherjar for future transfer is an interesting balancing act, especially as your party of characters grows larger and broader.  While the greater goal of supplying warriors for Ragnarok is greater in terms of overall significance, combat is a more immediate and certainly frequent challenge.  Luckily, tri-Ace has created a very strong combat system to resolve your frequent encounters with the undead.  Valkyrie Profile's battles occupy a weird sort of niche in between the completely realtime action of Tales of Destiny and a more traditional active time combat of Final Fantasy or Grandia.  Enemies and allies take turns attacking, but as in the Tales system, correct timing and positioning of multiple characters' attacks can result in extra damage or another advantage.    Your four-character party is mapped to the four face buttons, and when you tap the buttons, each character attacks immediately - it's a turn-based system on a larger scale, but within each turn, you attack in real time.  The order in which your characters attack, and the speed with which they work together, affects the amount of damage your party can deal with as a unit.  Some enemies have an unusually powerful block, which you have to break through with a fast and furious combination attack.  Others, in contrast, may have a block which only one character (like a powerful spellcaster) can break through, so they have to lead the way while the other characters strike in a quick followup.  Range is also a factor, since enemies are often arranged in two ranks, the second of which can only be reached with spells or missile weapons.  Altogether, it's an excellent system, requiring planning and quick thinking while still moving along very quickly - very few battles will bog down much at all, and things often get fast and furious, as you hammer the buttons to unleash as fast a succession as possible.  That's often the best strategy, because if you chain together enough strikes, the wonderful words ~Purify Weird Soul~ will fill the screen, and characters can cut loose with powerful special attacks.  To trigger the special attacks, you have to fill up your HITS meter in a single round of attacks.  The battle mode is underscored by a gauge that looks like a thermometer.  The long bit stretching out to the right represents the hit points of your target, and the round part at the end shows how many HITS you've built up with combination attacks.  As your characters rain down blows in quick succession, the round meter will increase, up to a potential maximum of 100.  Break 100, and it's time for some weird soul purification, but if you can't reach that maximum quickly enough, the meter will degrade back down to zero and you'll have to try again during the next round.  Planning how to trigger a special attack is an especially important strategy in boss battles, when you may need to take them down with a single massive assault, and the way the special attacks are bound up with the realtime combinations that you execute with ordinary attacks provides a great element of twitch-oriented strategy.  To succeed in combat, you have to keep your many characters equipped, with weapons, armor, accessories, spells, and support items.  However, as is standard for Valkyrie, the way you do this is just a little bit left of the norm.  There are no ~shops~ as such in Valkyrie Profile - you acquire items in dungeons by rifling through those good ol' treasure chests, but there's nowhere in particular you go to buy weapons, armor, accessories, useful items, and the like.  Instead, you materialize them out of thin air, through the divine energy Odin grants to you during each chapter.  During the Sacred Phase that precedes the chapter, she gives you your allotment of Materialize Points, which you can spend on items and a few other things.  On the main world map, or at a save point, you use the Divine Item section of the menu to create items with your store of Materialize Points.  The listing is updated each chapter, so you can regularly improve the equipment your characters use.  Divine Items also possess an important advantage over regular items, which is that they don't break.  A weapon you materialize with your divine energy will be with you forever - it won't wear out and leave you unarmed in a pinch.  Man-made weapons, however, ones you find in chests and the like, have a percentage chance of breaking during combat, and so while they may be more powerful, they're often dangerously unreliable.  Another unusual element of the item system is Transmutation - in the alchemical sense, the conversion of one thing into another.  By expending Materialize Points, you can convert a useless item you collect into a useful item, or one sort of useful item into an even more useful item.  A Vegetable Seed, which you can't do much with (you're a chooser of the slain, not a gardener), becomes an Elixir, a healing item.  As another example, certain types of spell crystals can become others, which may be of more use to you in a particular situation.  If you're facing fiery enemies and all you have is Flare Crystals, spend some MP and they'll become powerful Ice Crystals.  And if you don't want an item at all, you can simply sack it for MP to spend on something else.  Wrinkles like these add a little complexity to the fundamentally simple item system.  Graphics  Valkyrie Profile is, as I said, almost wholly two-dimensional, and I would not have it any other way.  The 2D backgrounds provide an unusual structure for its dungeons and towns, but more than that, they are absolutely beautiful, on par with Legend of Mana and SaGa Frontier 2, the best-looking hand-drawn games on the PlayStation.  Valkyrie actually seems to use a combination of hand-drawn art and computer-generated CG - some scenes have the smoothly-shaded look of 3D renders - but either way, there are many scenes that you'll simply want to relax and appreciate for a moment.  Individual animation elements and multiple layers of parallax scroll add a great deal of depth and detail, as in a scene set in a valley full of drifting flower blossoms.  Leaves shift in the wind and petals float through the air, while a massive mountain vista looms in the background.  The dungeons and towns are all crafted out of side-scrolling planes, which is something you might not have encountered in an RPG unless you played something like Sorcerian or Ys III back in the day.  In effect, they're just like the worlds in Metroid or Castlevania, but with an RPG combat system.  Exploring them entails a touch of action-oriented gameplay, though, especially the occasional excursion into platform-jumping.  There are plenty of ladders to climb, ropes to swing along, and gaps to leap across, particularly in conjunction with Lenneth's special abilities in dungeon sequences.  You can use your sword to slash at enemies (which triggers a battle where you receive the first strike), and fire icy blasts that temporarily freeze monsters or create crystals that you can use as jumping platforms.  The game remains an RPG at heart, make no mistake about that, but the action elements keep things interesting, and best of all, you can dodge any opponent you like - a la Chrono Trigger, there are no random battles whatsoever.  Which is not to say that you won't want to pick a fight now and again.  You need to do a certain amount of undead extermination to improve your characters' abilities, and the battle sequences are certainly easy on the eyes.  That's where Valkyrie's sprite animation is primarily displayed, showing it to be among the very best on the PlayStation.  Saturn die-hards may look down on some of the jagged edges and less-than-smooth animations, but the 2D characters are still remarkably good-looking in comparison to the competition on their own system.  In battle, the sprites are big, smooth, and possessed of a wide range of actions - idles and poses, sword blows and bowshots, and tremendous magical attacks.  Most attacks are accented by a certain amount of 3D, and the results are lovely, especially the more powerful special attacks.  Lenneth's Nibelung Valesti attack concludes with a beautiful 2D animation sequence: angelic wings materialize around the hovering Valkyrie, and she charges into her opponent wielding a massive spear, as the spectral image of a hawk coalesces around it.  Each of the many characters have their own special attacks, and all of them are definitly worth multiple viewings, especially the later ones that actually incorporate full-motion video.  At the same time, though, they're succinct and infrequent enough that I don't expect them to provoke the same exasperated reaction as Final Fantasy VIII's summon animations.  The more peaceful areas of Midgard may be a little quieter than the pyrotechnic combat sequences, but they're still a feast for the eyes.  The backgrounds, as I said, are gorgeous, the smaller town sprites still animate quite well (especially Lenneth, who runs and leaps with movements reminiscent of Castlevania's Alucard), but most of all, I love the character art, the portraits that accompany the speech of each character.  Valkyrie Profile may not have my favorite character designs on the PlayStation - Xenogears holds enough of a place in my heart to at least keep them tied for first - but Valkyrie's art is at least as good in its more shaded, traditional style.  The cast of characters is quite varied: knights, samurai, sorceresses, and more, but all of them are drawn with remarkable attention to detail.  Sound  Perhaps the only area where Valkyrie draws some criticism from me is its music - many of the dungeon themes carry on far too long with far too little variety to avoid grating on my nerves a trifle.  However, the sound effects are quite effective, and there are soundtrack pieces that I dearly love, especially the world map music and some of the shorter interludes from the many cinematic sequences.  The calm, foreboding music-box theme that plays when Lenneth attunes herself to the presence of a dying soul carries with it the uncertain promise of a second life - pardon me for waxing poetic, but that's how it feels.    The sound sequences that begin those character introductions, brief collages of music and voice, also spotlight the excellent English voice acting, for which I strongly commend Enix of America.  Enix has done a thoroughly professional job of providing voices to a large and potentially unwieldy cast - while there are unavoidable weak moments, almost all of the voices are well-suited to their characters, and the acting is consistently effective.  It's a bit weird to pick out voices from the American Pokemon dub, but strangely enough, their work is among the best in the game.  Jessie's voice actor does an excellent job as the sorceress Mystina, and Ash's voice, while he has only a small part, provides all the mood of a very touching scene. Forced as I suddenly have been into the basic IGN review template, it's only now that I can talk about what I really love about Valkyrie Profile, which is the story it tells and the people that make it up.  People, yes - though this is an ensemble piece with a very large cast, you do get to know the characters as the game progresses, and they take on an honestly lifelike quality.  The focus on their deaths lends the game a great deal of pathos, as they confront their regrets about their past lives and what they might have made of them.  As you follow them through their second lives, all of them develop to some degree, however small, and even after you send them to Valhalla, you can check up on them between Chapters and read about their exploits.For the amount of enjoyment I drew from the tale Valkyrie tells, I have Enix's superb text translation to thank.  This is not just good work for a first effort, this is one of the best English scripts I've ever read in a role-playing game, continually readable and almost entirely devoid of typos or weak moments.  Characters speak like they ought to - some rough, some formal, some friendly, some distant - and you relate to them accordingly.  I've played potentially excellent games that were broken by their translations, and I'm immensely pleased that Valkyrie Profile hasn't fallen into the same trap.One other thing I'd like to discuss at length is the game's documentation - not a judgment on it, since I haven't seen it, but a stern warning to Enix that it had better have put together a very clear, detailed, comprehensive manual for Valkyrie Profile.  It has many unusual, unfamiliar new game systems, and while they're not excessively complicated or difficult to grasp, their presence is nowhere near immediately obvious if you simply pick up the game and play it.  The Skill and Transfer systems are absolutely vital to effective progress in the game, but there's no tutorial system to introduce them to you, and so it's easy to miss them for the first Chapter or two.  Thus, the manual had better be a good one, and I'd advise everyone who plays the game to give it a thorough going-over - otherwise, if the reaction to Chrono Cross' Element system is any indication, the Q&A column will be swamped.But you shouldn't be afraid of Valkyrie Profile's complexity.  Its depth and originality are part of what make it great.  Yes, it is a great game, and I recommend it wholeheartedly to RPG fans, buried though they may be in great games this year.  If you want yet another fascinating tale to experience, mixed with as much innovative gameplay as any role-playing game around, make room in your budget and your schedule for this one.", "date": "Aug 30, 2000"}
