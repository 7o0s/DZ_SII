This expansion entitled Trials of Atlantis is Mythic's attempt the keep its MMO alive and prospering.  Trials of Atlantis is primarily a group based series of exercises or trials that takes the Camelot player through a version of the ~mythical~ watery world of Atlantis.  These Atlantian trials provide skills, equipment, and revenue as well as a healthy dose of adventure to the player willing exercise a bit of patience in forming his or her adventuring groups.    Atlantis was a fabled city destroyed in ancient times.  Its story has captured the imagination of people ever since it was first described by the philosopher Plato more than 2,000 years ago. It is this blend of mythology and fact that Mythic has used to create its latest expansion.  Trials of Atlantis is a departure from the norm for Mythic in that it removes the voluntary aspect of grouping to force players into larger groups to complete the trials. While this seems to enrich the group experience for some, it is the source of maddening delays and frustration for others.  Each trial is much like epic quests from the original game, with the difference being that while only some parts of the epic quests need a lot of friends to complete, most of these trials require large groups.  These quests involve killing creatures, retrieving items and acquiring experience under certain conditions much like other quests in Camelot.  One thing most players seem to agree on is that Trials of Atlantis has brought a substantial graphical improvement to the game.  Trees finally look more realistic and hills have had protruding rocks added to give a more realistic view of the entire Camelot world. The biggest change to the game has to do with Camelot's lakes, rivers and bodies of water.  Not only does water now look better in Trials of Atlantis, but players now have the ability to go underwater and play.  Using a special breathing device, players can move underwater to complete quests, trials or simply explore the Atlantian oceanic depths.  Moving underwater has provided a 3rd dimension of travel in the game.  No longer does the Trials of Atlantis player just have to worry about moving forward/backward and side to side but now must control up/down motion as well, giving movement when underwater in Trials of Atlantis a flying quality.    Not all activity in Trials of Atlantis takes place underwater; about half of all activity happens on land.  Between the underwater adventures and those to be found on land Mythic has triumphed in bringing the mythical concept of Atlantis to the Camelot gamer in a way that inescapably propels the player into the world of Atlantis.  Perhaps even more impressive as it was an expected bonus is the feeling of antiquity one gets when moving through this world.  This gamer was awestruck the first time I gazed on the Necropolis.      Mythic has richly supported the myth of Atlantis by infusing it with existing cultures such as the Egyptians and the Greeks.  As has been typical for Mythic, the introduction of myth and legend was done with great detail and is as good, if not better, than the integration of myth used when dealing with Celtic, Norse and Anglo-Saxon legends of the original game.  Storylines, quests and larger trials are permeated with the mythology that is reflective of a fine academic effort that in many ways turns a casual gamer into a real student of mythology. Still, as nice as Trials of Atlantis is, I am still left with a nagging question: why Atlantis?  Dark Age of Camelot went from the middle ages to antiquity.  The logic of that move escapes me.  As is true of most things, this expansion is not without faults.  Many of the quests/trials are very buggy and Mythic appears to have taken a ~sucks to be you~ approach to dealing with frustrated gamers that have spent substantial amounts of time working various quests only to have them fail due to a bug.  That is not to say Mythic isn't trying to fix these bugs, but is more reflective of the attitude in which Mythic tends to handle customer support issues.    I must call into question the introduction of any expansion before Mythic deals with the chronic problem of unbalanced and unfair competition in realm versus realm combat.  Each of the last two expansions of Dark Age of Camelot were designed to provide skills and equipment that would strengthen players in their contests against the other two realms. Realm versus Realm is still the focus of the game and ultimately used to determine the success of each individual realm as it competes against the other two.   Dark Age of Camelot is a game where numbers of players on a particular server in a particular realm contribute highly to the success of that realm and its players.  It is not the particular or even cumulative skill of players in Realm versus Realm that determine success.  In other words if a particular realm has more players in relation to the other two, that realm will ultimately be more successful.  It is the equivalent of having a chess match with an opponent with half a set of pieces competing against a player that is using a full set.   Mythic has a nice expansion in Trials of Atlantis, but it's kind of like having a broken leg and instead of the doctor fixing your broken leg, he hands you a new set of track shoes.  The actual workings of the expansion are well done and interesting but much more work needs to be done in terms of providing balance across the whole world. The lack of other, long-expected features, like mounts is also aggravating.", "date": "Jan 6, 2004"}
