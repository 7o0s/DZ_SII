Unless the developer fuses it with either some great gimmicks or excellent controls, the game invariably feels like a 30-year-old update to Pong. Unfortunately, Wimbledon 2005 has neither of those things, it suffers greatly for it.   Firstly, despite its official license, Wimbledon 2005 actually has no tennis stars in it. The game merely populates the top tennis tournament of world with name-out-of-hat stand-ins created by developer Pixiem. If you're going to pay the scratch for the Wimbledon license, why not fork out a little extra to at least get the names of a couple players actually participating in the tournament? Real tennis die-hards might be turned off by the lack of recognizable players, if their hopes aren't sunk by the game's next shortcoming: control.   Wimbledon 2005 features some of the slowest, most unresponsive controls we've seen in a mobile sports game. Hits are mapped to the number keys, as well as movement, and complications immediately ensue. When not accidentally moving when you want to volley, you'll curse the fact that you have to slow the game down to an incredibly dull pace to be able to successfully make the mapped shots you desire. The game does goose your stats and skills as you work your way up through the tourney ranks, but even the increases in speed and accuracy don't seem to do much to help.   Pixiem compounds this problem with the decision to move the camera up to the nosebleed seats. The players and ball are so small, even on a good-sized screen, to be able to adequately follow the game. And putting a green ball on top of a green court doesn't make things any easier.  However, Wimbledon 2005 does have a good set of audio cues. The opening and menu music is fine, and while playing, you'll hear digitized voice clips from the judge.  Wimbledon 2005 offers a multitude of reasons to stay away, save for its precious license. The control is positively unintuitive unless you slow the game down, but then that pretty much nixes any sense of excitement. It's like Pong played through molasses. In January.
