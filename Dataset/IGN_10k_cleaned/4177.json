Simply stated: Elemental Gearbolt is easily one of the genre's finest moments.  This is not your average lightgun game; Elemental Gearbolt is more of a traditional shooter, which just happens to utilize the gun as a means of input. No cops and robbers here  an exquisitely detailed, gothic fantasy world filled with monsters, dragons, and stunning architecture takes their place.  Blending outstanding, atmospheric visuals, a stirring musical score, and top-notch effects, the game is nothing short of a technical tour de force with a style all its own. Gameplay-wise, however, the game remains your standard shooter fare; in other words: there's no freedom of movement, and enemies pop out from the same points each time.   Presentation and polish considered, this lack of any true innovation isn't enough to make the game any less exciting. And it's definitely not without depth.  True to form, Working Designs has infused the conversion with countless extras, delivering in turn much more than a straight port of the Japanese release. Difficulty levels have been tuned, hidden extras added (for only the best shots), and, best of all, twelve hidden chalices  which boost weapons power  are interspersed throughout the game, vastly increasing lasting appeal.   Elemental Gearbolt may not be the most innovative lightgun title, yet it is certainly among the most refined, unique, and downright fun PlayStation has yet to see. If you're a fan of the genre, don't pass this one up.   Randy Nelson", "date": "Aug 25, 1998"}
