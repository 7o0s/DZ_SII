No? No matter -- the game was lost to video gaming history as dinosaurs Bub and Bob continued to enjoy the spotlight. But for a devoted following -- and Rainbow Islands has one -- this sequel is an exciting platformer that builds on the winning premise of Bubble Bobble.   You are a small boy with the magical power to cast physical manifestations of God's covenant with mankind to never send a flood again: Rainbows. You use these rainbows not only to make bridges to the ledges above you -- the goal is to reach the top of the vertical game field before the entire board is consumed by rising waters -- but also bowl over the colorful enemies that populate the screen. It's a very simple mechanic to use, but also quite versatile. In your haste, you'll soon find yourself casting rainbows that both build bridges at eliminate enemies at the same time. At the end of each world, you must face down a boss, such as a big spider.   Of course, you'll want to gather up as many points as possible before you reach the top. To bank points, scavenge fruits, stars, and other tasty treats left behind from squashed enemies or perched on ledges. You'll also happen upon power-ups, like speedy shoes or rainbow enhancers that let you release multiple rainbows at once.   I tested Rainbow Islands on an LG VX8100. The controls were fine, although it takes a few minutes to really get up to speed. I eventually found it easier just to use the number pad, as it allowed me to make more precise diagonal jumps via 1 and 3. The visuals are extremely bright and colorful -- as you might expect for a game with ~rainbow~ in the title. Having been a fan of the arcade original, I can tell you that this game offers a very reasonable visual approximation of the coin-op.  Rainbow Islands is a tough little number -- and that's both before and after you get a handle on the controls. The game is not remotely forgiving (which was how it kept eating quarters) with its one-touch deaths and meaner than mean bosses. If you dug the original, this is a good edition that should bring back some fond memories. But invest in a mouth-guard at the same time, because you might find yourself saying some pretty colorful things yourself when you cannot jam out a rainbow in time to stop a mean clown.", "date": "May 7, 2007"}
