In fact, I liked it so much that I even selected it as my personal Game of the Year in 2002 and still consider it one of the best role-playing games on the PlayStation 2. Of course, there were several reasons that the game stuck out in my mind so much -- the characters, the storyline, the setting -- but it was the Trinity Sight System in particular that really intrigued me. Essentially an extension of the storytelling ideas first explored in Final Fantasy VI and Shining Force III, the Trinity Sight System provided players with the means to experience a single epic narrative from multiple vantage points. Even better was the fact that after all the separated groups had finished their chapters, their storylines collided together and kicked off a big finish. It was a great idea, had extremely flexible pacing, and offered something that few others in the genre could: that is, an immense variety.   But Suikoden III had problems too. The combat system had been completely revamped from the excellence that was Suikoden II and it forced players to battle in pairs rather than individually. It also made leveling up extremely difficult because of the Final Fantasy X-style overworld map and a general lack of random encounters. In the end, it took away from the combat-heavy experiences that the first installments were, and made the game unnecessarily longer than it had to be. Even so, I still couldn't wait to get my hands on the inevitable Suikoden IV when the time was right, and I couldn't stop thinking about how great it would be to see the Trinity Sight System return with better graphics and an old-school approach to the combat. Now all I had to do is wait...   Unfortunately it looks like I'm going to have to wait a little bit longer, because in Konami Tokyo's awaited sequel, Suikoden IV, things aren't quite how I left them. Most everything that was innovative and new from Suikoden III has now been removed in favor of modified interpretations of older ideas. And whether it's a good change (pair battles have been eliminated and combat is definitely more frequent) or a bad change (no Trinity Sight System and the difficulty has gone way down), I still can't help but feel a little underwhelmed from the ultimate product that Suikoden IV has become.   Click For More Images Left at that, it may sound like Suikoden IV isn't a very good game. But then, that wouldn't be the truth now would it? The reality is, Suikoden IV is in fact, quite the entertaining RPG -- one that has infinitely more characterization than anything else on the market (having 108 primary characters will do that for you). Granted, the level of background information and exploration of each personality may not be as deep as it has been in previous titles, but for the characters that do get that kind of treatment; the results are more than favorable. Of particular note is the Gaien Knight, Snowe Vingerhut -- a friend and companion of your hero and the spoiled son of a regional overlord. Prior to playing the game I had heard from friends in Japan that his evolution as a character was definitely one of the best in any game of recent memory, but not until I experienced it did I actually believe it. Suffice it to say, I don't think there's another character like him in an RPG to date -- and watching his ups, downs, and movements in-between, will likely be most people's driving force towards finishing Suikoden IV's storyline.   Speaking of the storyline, it's a little weak when compared to the series as a whole, but is still well above average if held to the typical genre standard. What I particularly liked about it was the fact that the whole thing takes place at sea, which is a realm that that few role-playing games seem to expand on. Set in the barely mentioned Island Nations more than 100 years before the events of Suikoden I, Suikoden IV has a lot of the same plot devices that all the games have had up to this point: one lone hero banding together with 107 other Stars of Destiny to help defeat a great foe and save the world. This time around, though, the search that our exiled hero takes doesn't seem to have quite the same feeling of urgency that the first three installments had -- and more importantly, it's difficult to ascertain what some of your enemy's motives really are. The reason for this is because, while the supporting cast is fleshed out in a myriad of different ways throughout the adventure, the villains aren't treated with nearly as much respect. Had we been given a little more background info and behind the scenes happening from our enemies than what we were ultimately given, the plot could have been of award-winning quality. But as it stands now, it's simply just ~really good.~ This is where the Trinity Sight System could have come in handy    To its credit, the battle system in Suikoden IV is definitely an improvement over Suikoden III's... or at least, for the most part. On the positive end, the fact that we can control individual fighters instead of groups is a return that couldn't have come soon enough. While the faster pacing and increased encounter rates make combat in Suikoden exciting again -- something that the laidback nature of the franchise is always in need of. My only real complaint in this regard is that your foes aren't much of a challenge anymore. Sure they seem to take more hits and show up in greater numbers, but most of them are easily dispatched in one or two rounds. I was also a little disappointed that I could only control four characters at a time now instead of six, but that wasn't as bad in the long run as I thought it would be. At least the monsters are more interestingly designed in comparison to Suikoden III, though, and the fact that you can actually see how your weapon looks after it has been upgraded is a welcome (but overdue) touch.   My favorite new addition to the series is the Naval Battle sequences. Reminiscent of the old-school ship-based PC war games, these maritime confrontations are terrific fun (and provide a decent splotch of strategy between story points). At its core, these events are really just a refurbished version of the old-school Suikoden Army Battles from the PSOne days (Paper-Rock-Scissors) with the benefit of being able to control where your forces go. Too bad there weren't more of these, as I could have literally spent hours and hours messing with this feature alone. It's that fun.   Also fun is the inclusion of a ton of new and classic mini-games that have become the staple of the Suikoden franchise. In addition to the always-fun bathhouse scenes, there are still more than enough extras to keep you busy. Dice games, spinning top games, Mahjong look-alikes and a plethora of other time-wasters add a lot of replay value to the experience. And since Suikoden IV is the second shortest game of the bunch in terms of story-related gameplay (only the original is shorter), the addition of these mini-games goes a long way.   In terms of presentation, Suikoden IV is definitely a mixed bag. Graphically, the water and special effects look great (this does run on the same core engine that powered Silent Hill 3 and 4 after all), and the character models aren't too bad at. But as a fan of the first three game's over-embellished caricatures and distinct anime-inspired look, I wasn't too fond of the decision to make the protagonists look more realistic. It took away some of the personality that's synonymous with the franchise, and the simplistic and stiff animations didn't help. The new first-person perspective and controllable camera, on the other hand, was a smart inclusion.   Audibly, the game fares quite a bit better with strong voice acting work (a first for the series) and a better musical score that's healthier than the last game's. Like the previous Suikoden, however, the soundtrack is mostly relayed through ambiance and story-related cutscenes -- there aren't too many booming ~Listen to this or else!~ tracks to speak at all.I'll come right out and admit that I'm a Suikoden fanboy. I'm still disappointed that the Suiko Gaiden titles never made it over here from Japan, still try to track down the Saturn version of the original just for the sake of having it, and still think about how great Suikoden II was every time I play a brand new RPG. Ashamedly, that part of me wants to slap a nine at the end of this sucker and call it a day. After all, this is Suikoden!But then the practical thinking takes over and I realize that I just can't do it. Yes, the game is fun, yes it has some cool fortress building additions and mini-games, and yes, Snowe Vingerhut is one of the most interesting characters I've seen in a in a very long time. But even with all that combined, there's still one thing that Suikoden IV doesn't have: Heart. And for better or for worse the Suikoden series has always been about that: the emotions, the feelings, and the power of family. But with Snowe and a few other exceptions aside, Suikoden IV just doesn't seem to have it. Nor does it have the awesome Trinity Sight System which could have been a great step forward for the franchise as a whole.And yet despite all this, Suikoden fans such as myself will want to own it. Hell, I've played through the game and have obvious problems with it, and I still want to pick it up just so I can play through it again (yes, there's a New Game Plus and yes I have an obvious problem). But that's what it ultimately boils down to: If you're a Suikoden nut and loved the other three titles, then chances are you'll enjoy yourself with this one too. But if you're an RPG fan in search of something new, then keep in mind that Suikoden has definitely seen better days.", "date": "Jan 8, 2005"}
