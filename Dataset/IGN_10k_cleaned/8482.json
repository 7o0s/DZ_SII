Before that they were butchering classic arcade games like Marble Madness and Paperboy on the GBA for DSI. But long ago, way back in 2003, Frame Studios created an incredibly fun little action puzzler called Gem Smashers for the GBA. In it, the player controlled a ball constantly bouncing around vertically. It was up to the player to avoid hazards with their ball while knocking out colored orbs in order to exit each level safely. Fortunately, after a slew of forgettable games, Frame Studios has returned to that formula for an M&Ms-branded version of Gem Smashers. Unfortunately, the developers seem to have lost a lot of the magic that made Gem Smashers work as well.    In M&Ms: Break 'Em, the player controls (you guessed it) a bouncing orb that pinballs vertically off objects in order to knock out like-colored stationary orbs and find the exit to each level. There's a story here, something about M&Ms space agents tracking down a criminal named Mr. Runch, which doesn't help with the game's first major issue: it has almost nothing to do with M&Ms candy. Granted, there isn't exactly a well-developed M&Ms backstory, but aside from a distracting cartoon character on the right of the top screen, and a massive candy image on the bottom, this game has nothing to do with that candy-coated brand. Everything takes place underwater or in forests, and even the anthropomorphic orbs that need to be cleared out in each level aren't M&Ms. The playable orb does appear to be a piece of chocolate-coated goodness, but the developers rotate the sprite so constantly that it more resembles a mushy pile of pixels.    So, the game barely touches the license. But is it fun? It is, but it's nowhere near the polished effort that Gem Smashers was. The gameplay itself is still a nice blend of casual controls and deeper gameplay mechanics. To control their candy, the player only has to worry about moving left or right on the +control pad. To complete each level, though, they must bump into color pots to change their color, then knock out all like-colored orbs, collecting powerups and avoiding skull tiles until the exit door pops open and can be accessed. Powerups (some negative) cause the candy to speed up, slow down or temporarily reverse controls. Because the player can't ever stop their candy, things can get pretty crazy at times. Strategy comes into play frequently, like cutting a bounce short by ricocheting off a floating tile or sliding across multiple orbs in one bounce to save time. In later levels, color pots are frequently hidden behind orbs, forcing the player to go after specific colors in a specific order. A level timer is always counting down at the right of the screen, but it's hard to play so badly that it matters.    Boss battles make a welcome appearance every 10 to 15 stages and really break up the monotony of the main game. In these battles, the player controls their candy the same way, but must bounce against oversized bosses at strategic moments in order to weaken and kill them. One example is a creepy angler fish, which can only be hurt by bumping into its lure when it's the same color as the playable candy. There's a little too much repetition in these battles (get ready to fight the same boss over and over), and giant fish are just further proof that this game really has nothing to do with M&Ms. But fun is fun, and the idea of even having boss battles in a puzzle game is pretty unique.    Our main complaint with Gem Smashers unfortunately still hasn't been addressed. Every time an orb is knocked out, it flies at the screen in an effort to show off the system's sprite scaling and rotating abilities. Although visually engaging, it also blocks sight of the playable candy for half a second each time. When several orbs are taken out in one bounce, it's not uncommon to lose track of the playable candy entirely. New to this rendition of the game is the half-assed art and menus. In addition to Gem Smashers being a joy to play, its art direction and presentation were top notch. What happened? The sprites in M&Ms: Break 'Em are ugly and poorly rendered. Tiny orbs and icons in the environment look fine, but all other art from the backgrounds to the stationary character look like they were pixelled in oekaki.       Another disappointment is that the game doesn't use the DS system well at all (not too surprising, given that it was released on GBA at the same time). The bottom screen offers touch control, but the controls in this game are so precise that it would be impossible to play through it using the touchscreen. Instead, given the vertical nature of the gameplay, the developers should have considered spanning the playfield across both screens. The limited playfield (which doesn't even take up all of the top screen) forces plenty of repetition between levels that could have been better avoided if the puzzle designers had more area to work with. The DS microphone isn't used for this game either.    Music and sound effects are barely noticeable, but they match the license and vocal quips pepper the action every time the player does something particularly good or bad. The game offers 3 save slots and auto-saves progress as it's made. A wireless multiplayer mode is available, but it's not very creative; the player that breaks the most orbs first wins. And unfortunately, multiplayer requires each player to own a copy of the game. Given the bare visuals and tiny sprites, there's no reason single-cart multiplayer couldn't have been achieved. M&Ms Break 'Em is a fun game because it's based on a slightly better game. Puzzle fans that are tired of Tetris DS might enjoy this, but it's worth tracking down Gem Smashers on GBA instead. It's a prettier game without the chocolaty brand wrapped around it, and features stronger presentation and art. It can also be found for just a few bucks on eBay or in the used section of any game store.", "date": "May 17, 2007"}
