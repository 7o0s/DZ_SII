Even the putrid ~Son of Mask~ sequel served as source material for a rather enjoyable mobile game in the hands of Indiagames. Bruce Lee is the latest license for the developer/publisher to take on, and while this Rumplestilskin is unable to turn the game into gold, it's definitely a solid bronze.   Bruce Lee is an action game with adventurous overtures. Players star as the kung fu master Lee himself, punching and kicking through a rather cookie-cutter a revenge tale. The vicious Oolong clan has murdered Lee's master, and such a deed will not go unpunished. The tools of said punishment are plentiful. Lee has his trademark kicks at his beck and call, but in a move that spices up the game, Lee also has a few weapons, such as the bo staff and nunchaku, that can put serious hurt on the Oolong thuggery.   Action game fans might be disappointed by the lack of complexity to Lee's move set. There are no lengthy combos to trigger -- but the simplicity is sure to court more casual fans that want to settle into a few minutes with their kung fu hero. If you want a complex martial arts experience, boot up Jade Empire on the Xbox. It's too bad that Lee at least doesn't have one or two supermoves that really show off the limber hero's martial arts prowess, or that you cannot issue attacks while moving. Chalk that up to the inability of most handsets to allow multiple inputs, though.   For a game starring one of cinema's greatest fighters, Bruce Lee concentrates a lot of the basics of platforming. Hitting switches to activate environmental features, lots of jumping, and climbing from ledge to ledge. These elements are not as engaging as hoped. Indiagames has done better in this department with some of its previous efforts. It's not that Bruce Lee is bad -- it's just that it's platforming is surprisingly average from the talented developer.   Bruce Lee is visually appealing. While Lee lacks his recognizable face, there is no mistaking the in-game avatar. The lean frame, complete with the flying kick, is indisputably Lee. Lee's enemies could stand to be a little more varied, but the champ will square off against some martial arts archetypes, such as sumo. The levels are also fairly well designed and thought out. The music takes a major backseat in Bruce Lee, which is a disappointment. However, Lee's scream can be heard all throughout the game -- and that's sure to please fans.  Bruce Lee is a standard action-adventure-platformer, which is odd considering that previous efforts have shown Indiagames capable of more. Bruce Lee is not a bad game, though. It's just a down-the-middle affair that will still probably be enjoyed by fans of the late artist, but not too many others. If you absolutely must enter the dragon on your handset, Bruce Lee is a decent download, but all others should plumb Indiagames' catalog for better experiences.", "date": "May 11, 2005"}
