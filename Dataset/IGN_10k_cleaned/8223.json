It's been a good run, giving us great games like Bejeweled and Jewel Quest. But as mobile pushes harder to be a mainstream entertainment option, we can no longer keep rehashing the same formula that has been done to death on not just the smallest screen, but the casual PC scene, too.   Caterpillar, published by Starwave mobile and developed by Tik Games, is one of those games that missed its window. If you have played Collapse, then there is little to no reason to buy this minor update. You click on groupings of three or more like-colored segments, clearing the screen. The slight formula tweak is that you now have a caterpillar scurrying up the screen, line by line, leaving behind new colorful segments. Otherwise, the game is a replica and not especially noteworthy.   Caterpillar does off a few extra game modes, such as Conundrum, which requires you to clear the screen without leaving any errant segments behind. Pair installs two wriggling caterpillars going in opposite directions. This turns up the juice a little, but again, it's just two-pronged Collapse. Race has you working hard to thwart twelve advancing caterpillars.   The game looks just okay. Not a significant improvement over the original, but at least the pieces are slightly larger than those in Collapse.  Caterpillar is just Collapse with a bug makeover and a couple of extra play modes. The matching colors sub-genre in puzzle games needs to end -- I think Jewel Quest II was it for me -- and I suspect that at some point, the rest of the casual gamers will stop buying, too. Collapse was a great game four years ago, but things have changed and evolved, leaving Caterpillar something of a relic. The game isn't broken, just tired. Take a pass.", "date": "Mar 19, 2007"}
