His exploits are legendary. His deeds are commendable. His courageous fight against crime is heroic. And his life... lonely and empty.  So begins the next chapter in the Batman saga, picking up the pieces of a battered and aging Bruce Wayne. Evil still stalks the night. Now taking up the cape is a new Batman, Bruce's protg  and Gotham's only hope against a returning villain. It's a faster Batman, a sleeker Batman, a more daring Batman. This is Batman Beyond.    Features:  Collect several Bat weapons Battle your way through dozens of Bat enemies Detailed storyline with Bat comic screens Only for the Bat Game Boy Color    Ubi Soft's latest Batman title takes up the storyline of an upcoming full-length Batman Beyond video motion picture, due out this December. In it, the novice Batman is up against the fight of his life, as Bruce Wayne's arch-nemesis The Joker has somehow resurrected his career of crime, looking more fit and dangerous than ever despite his age.   One of the things going for Ubi Soft in this Batman Beyond game is that it's based on a well-written and interesting storyline, and that's translated well to the videogame version. The question of whether this is the real Joker, a new Joker, a cloned Joker, or a puppet of the elderly old Joker runs the course of the game through sharp dialog and plot twists. When the new Batman accidentally mentions to Bruce that Joker must be at least 80 years old and couldn't possibly be as spry and deadly as before, Bruce winces and avoids the idea that he too is beyond his time. Of course, the fact that the Game Boy version of the game is coming out before the video also means that several of the key plot twists of the movie will be spoiled in the game, so if you're a dedicated fan of the show, you might want to keep the game in your closet for a few weeks until the movie hits shelves.  Beyond that, Batman Beyond is a standard beat-em-up action game. Granted, this type of game is one that hasn't nearly seen its fair share of action on the Game Boy Color yet -- side-scrolling fighting games were a weekly staple on the SNES, but the pocket system has only seen a few bruises and bashes. But we're still waiting for a Final Fight quality of brawler on the Game Boy, and this isn't quite it. Batman has very limited attack power, with just a few punches and some finisher uppercuts and kicks to duke it out. He can't throw moves up or down, so this is yet another game where enemies have to foolishly line up for their beating because they can't attack vertically. Batman also has some weapons to mix it up some more, but the items in of the Bat utility belt only half serve their purpose. The Dark Knight Staff, for instance, does well to club some enemies, but the Nun Chucks are horribly weak, and neither gives any range to Batman's attacks, so what's the point?  Though the punches and kicks show this game's arcade roots, the developers have done some to extend the breadth of the adventure. Batman can fist fight his way straight through every wave of enemy, but for the more adventurous Dark Knight, there are multiple doors and paths to explore. The layout of these extra stages aren't quite brilliant -- they all lead to the same place, through mostly the same backgrounds, so while there's no way to get lost, there's also not much chance of seeing much new. However, exploring stages inevitably leads to more power-ups and some bigger baddies that otherwise wouldn't be seen, so there is a sense of exploring even though the game is still linear.  Visually, the Bat has seen better days, but this is still a serviceable stretch in the Bat suit. The game is sickly choppy, and hacks up worse when multiple enemies and attack traps are on screen. It's playable, but seeing that there's nothing fancy going on in the game's simple graphics and limited enemy animations, this shouldn't be happening. Foes are blocky and corny, without much expression. The new Batman, however, looks sharp and fierce, with the trademark wings and details. There's even two sets of graphics for when Batman is facing towards or away from the screen with his wings open -- nothing really interesting, but if the whole reason you're playing a Batman game is for the Bat, it's nice to see time went into suit.  We were expecting much worse from this Batman adventure, once described as a game  where ~players can play... with tactics for effectively working for the game process and complete the game with less damage to win as they think about.~ To see actual English rather than atrocious Japanglish in this Batman was a great surprise.The gameplay, however, is crumbling like Old Gotham. It's got a great story, but I'd rather see it in the movie than read it in the game. That leaves a simplistic brawling game as the mark of the Bat. It's fun to fight, but it's limited and has nowhere to go. Attempts to give depth go only so far in a chunky fighting game, and there are no puzzles or extended challenges to broaden the game. Batman gets his shots in, but without much character or verve in the gameplay and graphics, yet again the Joker gets away.", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
