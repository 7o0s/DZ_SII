Almost. Screen shots make Mission: Impossible seem a mission accomplished, and the stats on the package make it seem incredibly deep --dozens of gadgets, stealth missions, packed-in goodies galore -- almost to the Metal Gear level of game complexity. Much like the N64 and PlayStation versions of this series, the plan was incredible, but the gameplay killed the mission in action.  Features  Ten levels Five missions Variety of weapons Special equipment and gadgets Special Agent Organizer Only for Game Boy Color  Just looking at the manual of M:I, you get to see quickly what went wrong with this title. Out of 18 pages, only three actually explain how to play the game. Spy players will have to wade into the gameplay for quite a while before figuring out how this game is really supposed to play, and that's where the disappointment begins. The espionage action is a lot more basic that it leads on, even though you have a stealth meter. Here's how it works: Ethan Hunt is dropped into a one-room stage (he can enter buildings every once in a while, but the stages are still small). He is told to go somewhere. He does. Then he is told to go somewhere else and so something. He does. Then the next mission begins.  If the control had been deep, this linear structure would have been fine. But Ethan Hunt is a isn't exactly covert intelligence. He's capable of shooting, running, and doing a task at a key point. That's it. When you get to one of the game's objective key points, press B and then go on to the next objective. There aren't puzzles to break up the action, and the action isn't too hot. In fact, you're not supposed to shoot anybody, because that stops your stealth meter from counting. What kind of secret agent keeps his pistol holstered?  So it's a boring game -- those things happen, and sometimes the game can still be fun. But what really makes M:I frustrating is that it's also a sloppy game, and those two things don't mesh so well. Mission objectives tell you where to go, but once you complete one objective the text is replaced over the instructions. For instance, the game will tell you to pick up a tool and take it somewhere. Alright, so you find the tool where the instructions are, and you go to the objective screen to see what to do next. But instead of the directions, there is a message saying ~You have picked up the tool!~ Also, for a game that weighs so heavily on stealth, the fact that guards can's see Ethan if he's parallel to their straight line path just about negates the meaning of stealth. Apparently high espionage is just a matter of not getting anywhere within the tunnelvision sight of the blockhead enemies. Even the mission objectives are weak and faulted -- one stage has you walking around in a mine field with a mine detector that won't detect mines unless you're right on top of them, and even then you'll never see them until you're dead. You can crawl like in Metal Gear Sold, but that just means you're twice as likely to slip across a mine and blow up! Fantastic graphics and animation can't make this game appealing enough. It's boring, slow, and annoying. However, the extra features -- the calculator, message transmitter, address book, and remote control -- are almost worth the purchase alone. Check out our special feature on these functions to see if that warrants a purchase. To be sure, these are gimmicks that you can live without, but they're fun to play with. Unfortunately, while the gameplay reaches to be a Metal Gear, nothing ranks as well as that classic. The constant kills that push you all the way back to the beginning of the mission just make this game too taxing to be enjoyable. Pick it up for the toys if you must. The TV/Stereo Remote and other functions are fresh, but the game play isn't.", "date": "Mar 3, 2000"}
