But before that year, there was another: Alex Kidd. Alex was a monkey boy that was part human, part chimp with pointy ears and a goofy demeanor. He was SEGA's most notable mascot in the late '80s. But he didn't escape that decade.   Alex was the playable hero of several early SEGA adventures, like Alex Kidd in Miracle World, and Alex Kidd in High-Tech World -- games that launched on SEGA's 8-bit Master System. But after the transition into the 16-bit era, he lost his relevance and notoriety. While many prominent characters from the 8-bit days went on to great success in later generations, Alex was left behind. The monkey hero only received one more game on a system more powerful than the SMS -- Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle for Genesis in 1989.   Sonic took over for a reason. Enchanted Castle is a platformer, a side-scrolling hop and bop adventure. Alex learns that his father, King Thor, has been kidnapped and is being held captive on the planet Paperock, so he sets off to save him with his flying fists and feet. Neither, though, is very effective.   It's evident from the start that this Kidd's quest will be marked by annoyance, as Alex's play control is floaty and his attacks don't hit home. The basic punch attack is slow and has limited collision detection. It often won't register a strike even when the enemy is directly in front of the blow. The alternative, a flying jump kick, is hard to activate reliably. It's let loose semi-automatically in mid-air when you release the jump button, but is also picky in how in responds to colliding bad guys.   There are ways to upgrade Alex, by equipping him with items like a high-speed motorcycle and a flight-enabling, missile-launching helicopter. These collectibles are fragile, though, and will disappear when you take a hit from an enemy. Alex himself, actually, is only good for one hit -- just grazing a baddie is enough to send you back to the start of any level.   This unforgiving setup comes full circle with Enchanted Castle's boss battles, which aren't boss battles at all. Instead, stage-end enemies will challenge you to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. If you choose correctly, you move on. If you choose incorrectly, you die. It's all very random, and it's not at all fun.Playing Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle is all it takes to understand why the character didn't live on beyond 1990. The game is 16-bit, but plays as an artifact from the 8-bit generation... and it's not even a good artifact. It's frustrating, hard to control, and uses arbitrary games of chance. Skill isn't required very often. Alex Kidd in Miracle World was a major hit for the SEGA Master System in the mid-80s, but this Genesis follow-up is simply a letdown. Some games and some characters, are better left in the past.", "date": "Apr 19, 2007"}
