Since most people here in the States don't have any emotional attachments to drivers like Michael Schumacher or Mika Hakkinen, or their teams, Ferrari and Mclaren, there also hasn't been any real reason for the masses to even try to learn to play these games. With F1 2001, Electronic Arts is hoping to try and please both the F1 enthusiasts and those that don't really care all that much about F1, but are looking for a new racing game to play.   Gameplay Despite the fact that EA's past efforts were never considered to be top F1 racing simulations and offered enough arcade-like aspects to disgust many diehard enthusiasts, they still never quite caught on with casual racing fans because of their relatively boring feature setup. Since most Americans don't really follow the F1 season religiously, simply having a Grand Prix mode for an F1 game doesn't quite make the same impact as it would in sports that are followed more thoroughly here such as NASCAR, NFL Football or Major League Baseball.   It's obviously an important part of any F1 racing game and it's here in EA's F1 2001 complete with all of the current teams, drivers and tracks, but what's different is in the way that the Grand Prix and the race modes in the game are presented. This game's developers have gone ahead and given F1 2001 a more vidoegame-like setup where most of the game is locked up at the beginning, forcing the player to progress through the game at a slower pace.  This might upset those looking to turn on the game and either jump into a Grand Prix tournament or a single race on one of the tracks other than Silverstone, Hockenheim, or Monza (the only three tracks available when you first turn on the game), but it works well in the context of the game. Since the game forces the player to race on the different tracks in the Quick Race mode to open up the other tracks, there's an added incentive to play the game for those that might not know that Michael Schumacher is the world's greatest driver or that Mika Hakkinen plans to retire at the end of this season.   Plus, the game's Gran Turismo-like Challenge Mode, which must be partially completed before one enters a Grand Prix race, is a great place for novice players to get accustomed to these new vehicles that don't quite drive like any other that they're probably used to. Likewise, the different Grand Prix modes, including Custom Championship, Full Championship, Teammate Challenge and Domination all require certain segments of the Challenge Mode to be completed before they can be entered. Same goes for some of the in-game options such as interactive pit stops, weather, damage and so on. What this does is force the player to learn about each aspect of the game before they have to really worry about it on the track -- for instance, you'll have to complete some of the weather challenges before you'll have to deal with them in a Grand Prix race.  F1 enthusiasts that don't need to be instructed on how to drive a Formula One car might not see the need for this, but if they have any skills at all, they should be able to complete most, if not all, of the challenges in less than an hour. And truth be told, those looking for a completely accurate simulation of F1 racing might be better served elsewhere, anyway.  F1 2001 offers both Normal and Simulation driving styles. The Normal is for those that are looking for a more forgiving driving experience. In this mode, it's a lot harder to lock up your tires or spin out by over-accelerating coming out of turns and it's just generally a lot easier to recover from mistakes, such as hitting other cars or going into the grass. It's still challenging than most other types of racing games, but it's probably more forgiving than most other F1 games.  For those looking for a more accurate driving model, you can drive with the game's simulation mode. Here, it's a lot less forgiving, you'll need to brake a little earlier and worry about gassing more progressively coming out of turns, and the overall feel is much closer to a real-life simulation. It's still probably a bit too forgiving for those looking for complete realism, but EA has honestly done a fine job of making it close enough without sacrificing the game's level of fun.  As far as the AI is concerned, when the opposition difficulty is turned up to hard, it's extremely competitive and feels realistic. There's not as much cheating going on in comparison to past effort by EA in its F1 games and it really does a good job of giving you the sensation that you're racing against real drivers. It's not quite up to the same level as something like Jarrett and Labonte Stock Car Racing on the PlayStation, but it's far superior to the racing AI offered in Gran Turismo 3.   Graphics Of the two recently released F1 games, EA's F1 2001 is the better looking of the two competing products. It doesn't have the smooth, 60 fps, framerate that you'll get with Sony's racer, as its framerate hovers around 30, but it looks much more realistic on the whole. The cars are nicely modeled, well lit and have surfaces that reflect the background environments and at least look somewhat realistic, as do the backgrounds.   EA also scores some extra credit here as there are a lot of nice little driver animations here that you don't see much of in other games -- the driver will actually do things like take his hand off the wheel to pull off the tearoff strips on his helmet and you can actually see him use his fingers to shift gears on the wheel. There's also a cool extra camera angle, in addition to the standard front, behind-car, and TV-pod views, that shows the game from the viewpoint of the driver in the cockpit. It's not quite as functional as the others, but looks cool.  Sound My biggest gripe with the game's audio is that every single car in the game sounds exactly the same, which isn't the case in real life -- there are very subtle differences. However, it does make up with it because of the fact that the changes of the engine sound from gear to gear and at different speeds is really finely tuned. You can a really get a feel for how fast you're driving based on how the engine sounds, which adds a lot to the overall level of realism. The announcing is pretty scarce, though, and there's not much in the way chatter from the pit crew.  EA has done a good job of making a solid F1 game that should appeal to a wide audience, whether casual racing fan, sim freak or F1 enthusiast. It has failings in each area, but enough good qualities that should keep most people happy.", "date": "Oct 8, 2001"}
