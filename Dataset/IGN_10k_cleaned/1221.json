But even with the help of Frank Thomas, All-Star Baseball '97 still has nothing new to offer.  As far as features are concerned, this game has all the necessary options like exhibition and season modes, trade options, play-by-play commentary from Jon Miller, and all the teams complete with stats, stadiums, and logos.  On top of all these stock options, All-Star Baseball '97 also features a batting practice option and a Home Run Derby mode. But besides these features, there isn't much worth bragging about.  Graphically, the game just doesn't cut it. Not to say that sprite-based characters are out of date, but if you're going to put them in a game, make sure they possess more than four frames of animation. The pitching and batting animations tend to be choppy and the on-field players look pixelated.  The gameplay is almost not even worth mentioning. Pitching options are limited and the batting interface is horrible. A game like Grand Slam, where the interface is more interactive, makes baseball games a little more enjoyable as opposed to just hitting a button when the ball is halfway to the batter. You might as well play Bases Loaded for NES.  Coming from an avid White Sox fan, not even Frank Thomas should have put his name on this one. With poor gameplay and below average graphics, this one is a definite out at first.", "date": "Jun 3, 1997"}
