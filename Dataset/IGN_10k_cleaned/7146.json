Racquet sports, such as tennis or ping pong, are often a tough sell on mobile. Either they are so accessible that they are boring retread of the grandfatherly Pong, or unnecessarily complicated that after playing one or two games of thumb Twister, you're ready to go all McEnroe on your handset. EA Mobile's Air Hockey was a serious step in the right direction, thanks to its intriguing controls that took paddle movement out of your hands and placed you solely in charge of striking the puck. However, Digital Chocolate's Beach Ping Pong further refines the concept -- this is the first racquet sports game that offers hardcore depth and casual accessibility in a single package.   Honestly, I almost missed it at first. My first impression of Beach Ping Pong was pleasant, but I wasn't absolutely wowed by the experience. Beach Ping Pong is deceptive that way. You get out of it only what you put into it, and if you just approach it as a basic, tap-tap racquet game, Beach ping Pong is only an amusing trifle. Stick with it, try out different angles, different intervals for pressing the button in this ~one-button game,~ and you discover a surprising experience. It's a trend I've seen lately in a several mobile games -- hidden depth betrayed by a pathetic shopping experience or the trained expectation that all mobile games are purely surface affairs.   The tropical-themed ping pong game strips the actual paddle control, leaving you in charge only of hitting the ball. You simply press the action button to hit the ball, but only hitting basic returns won't get you very far in this game. You must then release when the location cursor on the other side of the table is positioned where you want the shot to go. Holding down the button powers up your shot, which introduces the wrinkle of putting some real velocity behind the ball, but not too much that you over-power the shot and miss the table altogether. Finally, you can double-tap the action button to put some spin on the shot and try to out-maneuver your on-screen opponent.   As soon as you master the art of bending shots and delivering perfectly placed power bombs, Beach Ping Pong becomes even more fun than it is during the entire learning process. The tournaments you play through in-game unlock six opponents and new paddles -- expect a couple hours of honest game play before everything is seen for the first time. But the game doesn't wind down even then, as your ping pong opponents become real contenders right alongside your own ascension in rank and talent.   Beach Ping Pong comes in two forms: 2D and 3D. I tested the 2D edition -- the 3D version replaces the opponent sprites with polygonal models. The graphics in the 2D edition are bright and cheery. The beach environment is pleasant and allows DChoc to dress up your ping pong nemeses in bikinis. Erotic? Hardly. Silly fun? Yes -- and part of a growing number of games on each side of the Atlantic that employ digital babes to garner eyeballs.  Beach Ping Pong comes highly recommended to any mobile gamer -- especially those burned by past racquet games. This game is the spiritual evolution of EA Mobile's Air Hockey -- a game I liked when I reviewed it -- but DChoc's one-button take on the court sports genre is a much better play. (That's no slight to EA Mobile, it's just a comment on how quickly concepts are improved on in mobile rather than console.) Beach Ping Pong is an exquisite example of one-button game play that so many mobile makers aspire to perfect and so few really achieve.", "date": "Aug 22, 2006"}
