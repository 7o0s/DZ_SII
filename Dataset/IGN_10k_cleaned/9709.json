The whole game is nothing but an ad for that company. Spot Goes To Hollywood is a perfect example: the intro plays like a CG commercial for 7 Up. Who wants to pay to play a commercial?  That said, the game isn't much better than your average commercial. You pilot Spot through all sorts of standard platform levels, like the Pirate Level and the Horror Level. There's even a (big surprise) Mine Cart Level. The whole thing is presented from an isometric overhead point of view, which only serves to confuse things, as Spot rarely moves the way you want him to.  The graphics are very 16-bit, so much so that the game looks just like its 16-bit incarnation, minus the fancy intro. Do yourself a favor and give Spot a wide berth.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
