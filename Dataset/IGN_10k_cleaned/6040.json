Titles like Rome: Total War, Kohan II, and Ground Control II helped make the year special. But one of the most exciting RTS titles to be released came from the studio that brought us Homeworld and Impossible Creatures. Only this time, they dove into one of the deepest science fiction licenses around. Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War finally brought the table top game to computers to the sound of screaming explosions. This is a game that I still try to put hours into even with everything else I have to do so when word of an expansion came down, it was just a matter of waiting for the release, which as luck would have it, is now upon us.   We got a bunch of puzzled emails when Relic and THQ announced the Winter Assault expansion pack. The new faction, the Imperial Guard, probably was the main reason for this confusion considering the Space Marines, while a separate entity, are part of the Empire and therefore allied with the Guard. With so many other different races spread about the galaxy that are equally as violent, it seemed an odd choice at the beginning. But they made a smart decision here. While there's something cool about having another alien faction to play, the Imperial Guard allows for a more defensive style of play, which is what Relic was looking to include.     The Imperial Guard is made up of the average Joe. These aren't stimmed up super soldiers that have been bred and trained for the savagery of combat, but guys with families and lives they'd actually like to keep. For that reason, the basic Guardsmen tend toward the defensive because of their relative one on one weakness with any of the comparable basic units of the other factions. Along with good defensive structures, which include bunkers where they can hide and shoot (not to mention move freely in between them by traveling through tunnels), are defensive vehicles like the Hellhound flamethrower tank (brilliant for defense against infantry assaults) and the Basilisk artillery. They even have a fast walker called the Sentinel that can run out and un-capture control points in enemy hands so that most of the forces can stay in the shelter of the base.   One of the more interesting factors when considering how to use the Imperial Guard is their morale. Anyone that played the original Dawn of War will remember the bits where the Imperial Guard played a role in the campaign. Compared to the Space Marines, they were weak sauce, in large part because of the hit their morale would take so quickly. To counter this, special leader units can be attached to troops that will give them a morale boost. The Commissar (one of these units) can even execute one of the members of the unit in order to provide a morale boost ala WWII Russia.   Only time will tell how well the Imperials are balanced for multiplayer and skirmish, but from what we've played here, they seem pretty well matched. Those of you worrying about the fast and addicting pace of play getting turned down a bit for multiplayer because of the defensive nature of the side can rest easy. The pace is still fast and while players will probably want to stay closer to home with the Imperials, they're not exactly slouches out in the field. They can match up well provided there are enough of them in the same place to provide ample fire and if they manage to survive long enough, they can get some of the best infantry in the game with the mutant Ogryns and then really bring the pain. The way the game is structured means that even with a more defensive minded game, players are still going to have to push out and grab capture points in order to acquire resources. All in all, it's a good addition to the faction card in Dawn of War.    One new unit has been added to each existing side as well. There's less to say about each except that they fit a role that was either missing or needed some bolstering. For instance, the Fire Dragons of the Eldar help out with their anti-vehicle capabilities. The addition of the Mega Armored Nobz for the Orks is probably my favorite of the bunch as they can really turn the tide of a battle... it just takes them forever to get there.   The new campaign game mode provides a great place to learn how to use the new factions and units and also allows players to choose their side this time around, something missing in the parent product. Two campaigns following either Order (Imperial Guard and Eldar) or Chaos (Chaos Space Marines and Orks) of five missions each provide some good fun and good challenges. These missions definitely seemed more difficult in general than those in the Space Marine campaign in Dawn of War. Some of them even promote a much more fast paced style of gaming. One in particular has players either escorting or chasing down a convoy across a map which will have players scurrying around trying to capture points, fend off enemies, and complete an objective that keeps moving around.   The fact that a couple of the maps are shared between the campaigns may bother some people, but considering the storyline and how all of the races fit together in its telling, I think it actually works well. That same mission I mentioned briefly above can actually be played from any of the four sides that take part in the campaign. While playing through the Order campaign, players can approach it from the vantage of the Guard or Eldar. The Guard have to escort some VIPs through the battle zone to the other side of the map, capturing points and reinforcing troops along the way. The Eldar meanwhile will have to move their base across the map using the relocate function in order to beat the Imperial Guard there. Conversely, the Chaos campaign will have the Chaos forces trying to catch and destroy the escort while the Orks will be trying to catch up to and kill the Eldar. In both campaigns, the two sides can be switched between at any time, allowing players to try and make both of them work.     I really like the fact that they're trying to do something new and fun here, but I had some problems with the mission. Because you could switch back and forth between the two sides, it was really difficult to manage what was happening. While playing the Guard, the Eldar simply sit there and vice versa. This leaves whatever side you're not playing idle, which kinda ruined the fun to me. I would have rather made a choice from the beginning about which side I was going to play and stuck with it or had control over both factions at the same time.   Still the mission is fun and allows you to ultimately make a choice about which race you'll be taking to the final mission. The final map is basically the same (a few minor changes) for all four of the races and centers around a gigantic piece of Empire armament that had been undiscovered by the Chaos forces during their occupation. The differences are in control point locations, starting locations, and objectives. Each faction is slightly different in order to provide a different challenge each time. Playing a similar situation through with different races in campaign mode really shows off the differences in play style of each of the races. The chance to play as different sides in the campaign was certainly a welcome one.     Through all the game, the style is still consistently brilliant in the way it brings the insanely dark and brutal galaxy of the future to life in real-time strategy. Everything from the style of the art and incredible animated battles to the dramatic music is just about perfect. There may not be another kick ass opening cinematic from Blur (I still love watching that thing every time the game loads up), but it's hard to really care when the rest of the game is presented so well. Some of the voice acting for the main characters still needs help (I'm talking to you General Sturnn) but all of the new unit acknowledgements for the Guard are very good though I wouldn't have minded different versions for each of the vehicle types   Still, the game needs some more AI help. You can see through the campaign and skirmish that some of the units still have a problem making intelligent decisions about targets. Watching replays in skirmish in particular can point out some serious flaws in the AI routines, especially when it comes to protecting their own interests. When an AI's base is being attacked and destroyed, you'd think they'd break off some of their forces just sitting around a control point in order to help defend like a humie player would. I'd say it was just a glitch, but it's been pretty consistent in replays I've watched. Also, pathfinding can still be an issue in big groups. The Imperial Guard shows off this shortcoming fairly often as large groups of men and vehicles just get confused when told to move at the same time. This is a real problem when trying to use the gigantic Baneblade tank. You'll probably be leading the charge with it most of the time, but when infantry start swarming around it to get at enemies and help the fight, things get messy.    Relic's got a formula here that makes a lot of sense in this mad universe and promotes the kind of crazy and chaotic play that you would expect from a multi-faction battle. The Imperial Guard only add to the frantic gameplay in a positive way by allowing a slightly different style of play for the more defensively minded. The campaign portion of the game is about 10 missions total well, more than that if you count variations, but it provides enough of a challenge to make playing worth it. Skirmish and multiplayer are as fun as they ever were and more maps equals more variety for the madness. The AI could still use some work, but overall, the experience is good.I really hope that Relic and THQ make a habit out of releasing Warhammer 40,000 RTS games because they're really good at it. I'm already salivating at the possibility of sticking this fiction in their new Essence engine, which if you haven't seen in their upcoming game Company of Heroes yet, is sweet. Either way, the future seems bright for one of the best licenses around if Relic can continue in the fashion set by Dawn of War and its expansion Winter Assault.", "date": "Sep 20, 2005"}
