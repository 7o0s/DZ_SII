Alas, the poor robot's close-up was not to be, as SEGA quietly canned the project. But fans of the heroic bucket of bolts need to fret, as SEGA Mobile is giving them a to-go portion of their fave 16-bitter.  Features:  Action gameplay Three weapons Multiple enemy types  Vectorman on the cellphone is essentially a smallish port of the original Genesis game. You are Vectorman, the last of the free-thinking robots. You must out to rid the land of the oppressive machines that have enslaved the other robots. Armed with an upgradeable blaster, you must work your way through a series of industrial-themed levels, wasting enemy robots and turrets.  SEGA Mobile recreation is a fan's dream come true. (Of course, the matter of how many Vectorman fans there are running around is another story.) The game is actually a very slick port of the 16-bit classic. Many of the original power-ups and enemies are back in play. The overall look is very close to the original, too, right down to the girder-laden levels and the item-filled televisions.  You begin the game with your basic blaster, but it can be powered up to a ~Rapid Gun~ or a ~Wave Gun.~ These power-ups are found in the televisions scattered throughout the levels and they last for only a brief period of time, so make them count. You can also uncover smart bombs that clear the screen, a ~Health Ball~ to replenishes energy, and a score multiplier that ups bonus points.  As you wind your way through the levels, eliminating foes, always be on the lookout for ~Photons,~ which Vectorman receives extra points for picking up. Not all of the Photons are just laying around, prime for the pluckin'. Many are revealed only after dispatching an enemy unit, such as a Beedle, Turret or Sludge Pilot.  Vectorman controls quite well -- the only caveat is the jumping, which is kinda ~floaty.~ Sometimes, you want to just hop up and blast a Turret, but your jump carries you all the way up to the next platform. It's a minor complaint, one that somewhat pales considering the fact that you are playing a recognizable 16-bit game. Sure, it's doesn't look as good as some of the NES revivals we've seen lately, but at least somebody is trying to represent for the early 90s era. Vectorman is one of the better platformers you will find on the Sprint PCS service. We tested it on a Sanyo 8100, and were decently impressed with the visuals and sound. Are there smoother, prettier games out there? Well, yes. But if you were a fan of Vectorman back in ~the day,~ this is a must-download. After SEGA Mobile's recent misfires (Flicky comes to mind), it's good to see a quality title back in play.", "date": "Mar 17, 2004"}
