Not for me, you understand, but for someone who knows chess and knows computers, it's not that hard. Think about it; as a rule, chess computers have been popular and mighty challenging for a while now. It should come as no surprise then that the 13-year-old Chessmaster franchise should offer some tough competition in terms of AI. But it's not enough for Chessmaster to make a great chess AI. Continuing the trends established in the earlier titles, Chessmaster 7000 allows for an even higher level of customization and chess study.  But there is something that separates the Chessmaster AI from others. First off, there's pure quantity. Chessmaster 7000 includes opponents of all abilities. There are over 80 opponents ranging in skill from inexperienced to expert. Those of you who feel a real need to humble yourselves can play against any of 38 grandmasters including Kasparov, Fischer and Tal. No, not that kid who does the Q&A, the famous chain-smoking Latvian. And then there's the Chessmaster himself. CM7000 provides all sorts of information on play style for each of these players so you can set up a match that will provide an appropriate challenge. And there are convenient filters so you don't have to search through all the players to find the one you want.  If you don't like any of the pre-designed players, you can make your own. This is where the game gets deep. You can set their opening books, as well as style and positional options. I had a fun time trying to recreate some of the people I've played in the past. My old roommate Duncan, for instance, likes to control the center but has a pawn weakness. My friend Chris is a very random player but always strong on the attack. You can also set the material values for pieces too. I don't value my queen as much as I value my opponents, so if I were setting myself up as a computer player, I would keep the value of my own queen at 9.0 and set the value for my opponent's queen at 8.6.  There are seven ~rooms~ in CM7000. When you first enter a room, you'll want to reconfigure it so it provides a comfortable atmosphere. You can pick from a number of different 2D and 3D chess sets, from the classic Staunton to more...inventive designs. Each set comes with several different piece styles as well. For the most part, this isn't very useful. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to be able to pick and choose from among so many boards, but many of the boards are tilted so that it's hard to see where the pieces are. Add to that the fact that many of the piece sets are wholly unfamiliar, and it becomes a real challenge to actually play the game.  In addition to the board itself, there are a number of windows that you can open to help you understand the game a little better. The Game Status window displays player ratings, the timer and the move list. Apart from the timer, this window is of little real use during play, but is very useful for after-game analysis. The Annotation window allows you to input your thoughts on each move. You can also use the Annotation window to view the Chessmaster's thoughts on your game. For the most part these insights are obvious (...pins black's bishop, frees up a king-side castle, etc.) but occasionally the Chessmaster will surprise you with much better sequences of moves (Much better is ...a4 which leads to 5. 0-0, Nxc5, and so on). Often these lines are five or six moves long and really do lead to better positions. My only gripe is that the annotation takes a while to process. Go fix a sandwich and catch some TV.  Four of the rooms are game rooms, that is, rooms where you can come for a little competition. The main Game room allows you to play an unrated game against any player you choose.  These games don't count except in terms of experience, so you don't need to sweat it too much. The real deal is to be found in the Tournament room. Here there are no hints, no takebacks, no help at all. You can set up round robin style tournaments and even watch the games unfold as a spectator. I actually enjoyed setting up a tournament between 8 grandmasters and watching them play.  The CMLive room allows you to go online on the old Mplayer and play against other gamers from around the world. At least, those countries with a Chessmaster retail outlet. With options for open posting of challenges as well as individual challenges, you should have no trouble finding an opponent. Except for that Mplayer only has CM6000 on it so far. I haven't found the option to play the 7000 version yet. You can specify the parameters of the game in terms of time controls, whether it's rated or whether you allow takebacks or not. Once you've been trounced in all three rooms, it's time to move on to the fourth, the Kid's Room. This room offers drills and instructional programs by none other than Josh Waitzkin, the kid from Searching for Bobby Fischer.  Even though playing games is the only sure way to learn chess, the good player takes advantage of study. This is what separates CM7000 from the rest in my opinion. CM7000 offers three non-game rooms to help you refine your abilities. The Classroom offers tutorials that cover the basic concepts of the game. There are also drills and annotated game study, also by Waitzkin. You can get practice on your openings with the 2200 opening book lines in the game. I was particularly intrigued by the diagnostic rating exams offered here. Unfortunately these are poorly implemented. Most of the tests are four or five part, and if you get the first part wrong, you're sunk for the rest of the exam. So even if you make the best move possible, it is still considered incorrect as a consequence of your previously incorrect answer.  The Library offers you the chance to study the opening book reference a little closer. You can even add your own opening book lines to the game and specify which players are likely to use them. There's also a game study feature where you can play through any of the matches that ship with the game. The Database room contains a searchable menu of 500,000 games ranging from 1790 to 2001. You can study Philidor's defeat of Captain Smith or Botvinnik's loss to Capablanca in 1938. You can also check out Kasparov's much publicized matches against Deep Blue. You can even add your own games to the database. And if you're wondering how CM7000 has a game from 2001 on the database, all you have to is remember Frank Poole's match with the HAL 9000.  CM7000 also offers an in-game coach. If you're stuck on a particular move, the coach will not only suggest the move you should make, but will extrapolate among all future moves to show you how your strategy will play out over time. You can also solve for mate, and the coach will tell you which lines are most likely to mate your opponent. Add to this a graphic representation of board control as well as the option to see the thinking lines for your computer opponent, and you've got a remarkable tool at your disposal.  Even with all this said, CM7000 still gives you even more options. There's just not space enough to go into them all. I was very impressed with this game. Like I said at the beginning, good chess computers are all over the place. What makes this game different is the degree to which you can customize the play options. But when stacked up against a title with the same flexibility, it's the usefulness of CM7000 as a reference tool that brings the most value to the game. There's still no substitute for sitting down with a human opponent over a real wooden board, but CM7000 offers a substantial and scalable challenge. And short of hiring a chess coach, I can't think of anything better you could do improve your game.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Oct 12, 1999"}
