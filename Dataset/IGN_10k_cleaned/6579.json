Crashingly simple instead of casually uncomplicated. Flaccid instead of titillating. Boring instead of fun. Nobody goes into any chapter of the this storied series looking for high-minded humor or deep game mechanics, but Magna Cum Laude doesn't even seem to be trying.   Magna Cum Laude is composed of a series of vignettes where Larry does everything he can to finesse his way into the fancy of a cartoonishly buxom college co-ed. Now, that's not a bad idea, at all. A series of sexy little mini-games with tongue-in-cheek humor would be a gas, a great way to blow off some steam between the daily rigors of life. But the mini-games in Magna Cum Laude are actually just one mini-game with the exact same mechanics, repeated over and over in front of different visuals and situations.   Here's what you do in Larry's life. There is a box in the upper corner of the screen that flashes yellow twice, then red. While the box is flashing, you have to input the numbers inside said box before it turns red. As soon as it turns red, you have to hit the number to the left of the box as it flashes with a starburst. The more accurate you are, the more confidence Larry has, and the more things go his way in the vignette. Larry's confidence is measured by a penis-shaped meter on the right side of the screen. It's puerile, but I'm okay with occasionally puerile things.   But puerile always needs to deliver. And that's where the sexiness of Magna doesn't make anybody Cum Laude. There's a phallic meter on-screen. Sperm with Larry's head floats across the screen. Larry spanks co-eds. But when you play strip tease with them, their boobs are censored. Sorry, Larry, but you don't succeed in going half-mast on me like that. (I understand that carriers are likely weary of nudity, but then just don't bother with offering the game at all.)   Even if Larry had the stone to offer pixilated titillation, there's the simple fact that the singular game mechanic is deliriously un-fun. Jamming on a bunch of numbers, only to have to hit the last one rhythmically just doesn't play well. At times you'll have two choices of number combos to choose from --- easy or hard -- but even choosing the longer string doesn't make Larry any more engaging.   The ladies in Magna Cum Laude are over-the-top -- definitely not like the girls I went to college with. There are several of them in the game, each with different outfits to cover their curves. The animations in their sequences consist of a few frames of movement, like snapshots of a movie turned into a flipbook. I tested Larry on a S710, and the game was fairly colorful, but the compression of the renders made them a little washed-out. There is a fairly innocuous melody that plays over the action. Or inaction, as it is.  Leisure Suit Larry is just a lazy, lazy production. Repeating the same, dull mechanic of punching numbers -- hardly even in rhythm -- is not fun. I absolutely had to force myself to slog through the game to see if it would get any better, but no dice. The scenery changes from time to time, but there is still little reward for your trouble. The game wants to be wink-wink, puerile fun, but in the end it just shoots blanks. Avoid like the clap.", "date": "Jan 27, 2006"}
