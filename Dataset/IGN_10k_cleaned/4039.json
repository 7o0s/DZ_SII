There's a small but dedicated following among the hardcore audience but even sim-lite games like Crimson Skies fail to attract a great deal of interest among more casual gamers. And it's a shame, really. There was a time when games like Aces of the Pacific and Red Baron competed much more vigorously with the action and strategy titles that have become the very foundation of the PC gaming catalog.   Perhaps it's the increasing mainstream mentality that's pushing these titles to the fringe. Gamers in the early 1990s were likely to have built their own machines and, as such, had a mind that didn't crumble under the weight of a 200-page manual. As PC gaming has become more widespread, the overall patience and complexity threshold of gamers seems to have dropped as well. (Adventure and puzzle games seem to have suffered the same fate for similar reasons. Building a computer from scratch is apparently fantastic preparation for The 7th Guest.)   All that's said as a means of introducing The History Channel: Battle of Britain 1940. While the plane on the box reads like a huge ~Do Not Buy!~ sign to most gamers, there's a lot to love about this title, whether you're a hardcore sim nut with an $800 yoke and rudder set or a $20 budget-joystick flight rookie. That, in itself, is a claim we often doubt; I've yet to meet a publisher or developer who fails to claim that their game will appeal to both a hardcore and casual audience but, in the case of iEntertainment, it's a claim that's borne out by the game itself.   Late in May of 1940, British land forces on the Continent found themselves backed in to a corner at Dunkirk. A hasty and miraculous evacuation (codenamed: Dynamo) assured Britain's survival until the tide began to turn against Hitler's war machine. This is the starting point for Battle of Britain. You'll oversee the evacuation (or try to prevent it on the German side) at the very beginning of the game. As the RAF player you'll mostly spend your time intercepting enemy bombers en route to English bases. You'll even take part in fending off the Luftwaffe's all-or-nothing Aldertag offensive. On the Luftwaffe side, you'll simply take the role of an Axis fighter pilot tasked with escorting your bombers. In all there are 12 missions here, flyable from either of the two sides, culminating in the hypothetical Sea Lion invasion.   A series of over a dozen instant action missions offer quicker access to fun without the same level of commitment required of you in the campaign. These run the gamut from head-to-head duels to rear gunner missions to manning an anti-aircraft gun on a Royal Navy ship. I wish that the team had included a bit more player control in the variety of missions. Setting up engagements with specific planes under specific circumstances seems fairly appealing and would definitely benefit the title's replayability. As it is, the gunner missions are a nice change of pace.    The game also comes with a free online dogfighting arena where you can test your mettle against other online pilots. There are a variety of maps here and each of the teams in the game is assigned certain airfields. There can be a bit of a problem here in terms of airfield campers shooting your plane before you even cut your engine on, but this is usually solved by picking an airfield further from the frontlines. This of course results in longer waits to get to your target but it can also give you a chance to build up some speed and altitude before finally joining the furball.    While the inclusion of planes from beyond the context of the Battle of Britain kills the brand somewhat, it definitely increases the appeal of the online matches. Being able to take the skies in an A6M5 or a P-38L really adds much more variety to the matches. And when you get on a server that has hundreds of pilots rather than dozens, things can get quite varied indeed. There are also ground vehicles to be found here but the main action is still found in the skies. The only really weak spot of the multiplayer matches is the interface; I keep quitting to the main menu every time I get shot down. (On a related note, I found the web-ish names of the offline pilots kind of distracting. While I'm more than happy to shoot down gimli or fook or podboy in an online match, seeing those same names in the offline campaign kind of kills the realism.)   At its high end, the flight model will seem both challenging and rewarding to the hardcore crowd; at its low end, it should prove accessible enough for amateur pilots to get their feet wet. From there you can scale the difficulty up as you get better. Hey, we all started somewhere, right? A series of training missions are available but I still think it would be more instructive if the lessons let you try some of the maneuvers yourself.   Those of us with tastes that fall between the hardcore and arcade sensibilities can find a nice balance here. Helpful additions like the ~Fly Me~ feature make things easier. In the case of ~Fly Me,~ you can let the AI take control of the plane. This is really useful in a variety of ways. First, it can free you up to go make a sandwich while you're traveling to target. Second, it can help you find the rest of your squadron if you've chased a lone plane beyond the point where you can see the rest of the action.   Otherwise you're on your own. At the most unforgiving flight model setting you'll need to fly every surface of your craft and maintain a high level of awareness in terms of speed and altitude. Thankfully, small buzzing and buffeting forecast stalls and spins. Though it takes a while to find your balance with the cues, they certainly help you realize when you're asking more of your airframe than it can deliver. Torque effects and various other forms of drift require careful and constant stick manipulation to maintain your heading but a series of adjustable trims let you tweak the craft to fly in a particular orientation. (By adjusting or ~trimming~ the control surfaces you can trick the plane into flying straight, basically.)   The cockpits look great but those of you who prefer to play without the office view will have to rely on the cumbersome HUD overlays that indicate speed, ammo levels and the like. The upside to playing this way is that you'll probably learn really quickly where the airspeed indicator is in all of the planes you fly. In addition to having unique models and cockpit layouts for each plane, the team has done a good job of approximating the various performance characteristics of each craft. The Spits and 190s are par for the course here, but the Hurricanes and 109s which were the real stars of the battle get their due as well.    On the subject of realism, there are a few areas of the game that trouble me. To begin with, the collision detection seems a bit off as players are able to clip trees and even skim along the ground without any immediately disastrous consequences. Likewise, the fact that planes burst into flames when they crash in to the water seems kind of...well, wrong.    But otherwise, I'm all for things bursting into flame. The damage and gunnery models here are excellent. The tracer effect is quite well done and gives you great feedback in terms of aiming. (As you can see from some of the screenshots, a handy lead indicator can let you improve your gunnery.) Once your bullets start to hit, you're rewarded with bursts of smoke, oil leaks, bits of debris and outright fireballs. Lighting up an enemy bomber feels quite satisfying here and the fact that you can disable (or destroy) certain parts of the plane makes it even better. Imagine watching a tailless Junkers tumble out of the sky.   The graphics don't necessarily compete with the latest offline flight sims but they're right at the level we expect for online sims. The planes themselves are easily identifiable in a far off silhouette and you can see all sorts of marking and seams when you get really close. Terrain textures provide a great sense of speed when you're flying low over the land and water textures look great in high quality mode. Smoke from tracers gives you great gunnery feedback and the satisfying puffs of smoke from your enemies makes you hungry for more.   Those of you with slower machines will find a number of options to improve performance. You can set, among other things, the number of polygons are used to render the terrain as well as the range at which aircraft will appear at their highest level of detail. Even so, you may still find some odd performance problems here and there. There is some occasional and slight stuttering in the menus even on my super powerful rig.   In terms of other settings, I wish the input mapping had been a bit more convenient. Instead of presenting players with a large list of all the commands (or even smaller lists of commands within certain areas of performance), the game simply provides you with a few drop down menus from which you're expected to find and bind your keys. Since I use the big Saitek stick for most flight sims, I had plenty of buttons available but no way to check a master list of what they each did. In either case, after flying a few missions, I went back and rebound the keys I used most often.    I am a bit confused over the use of the History Channel brand here. While the promotional materials for the game seem to indicate that The History Channel has assisted with the project, there's very little History Channel presence in the game. I had assumed we'd get some cool footage of the battle or some period radio broadcasts or something. Instead it seems as if The History Channel is more of a promotions partner, offering their brand but little else. Whatever their involvement, they've managed to hitch their name to a flight sim that offers a rare one-size-fits-all approach.   For the price, you really can't beat Battle of Britain. At $20 under the Activision Value label, this is a title that soars well above its budget-price. To be honest, I expected high things of the title when I heard it was being developed by iEntertainment. Their association with the genre is well known and I hope this title brings more gamers into the flight sim fold. With the budget price and scalable flight dynamics, there's certainly enough of a reward here for casual players. That's provided they bother to try out the game for themselves.The online community for the game is strong both in terms of skill level and overall presence. You'll rarely find too few opponents online. Since most of the top-tier flight sims include some form of large scale arena, whether you go with Battle of Britain or a competing title (like Fighter Ace, WarBirds, AirWarrior, etc.)  will depend on your tastes. In this case, the fact that Battle of Britain offers the same sort of experience for free is a powerful argument in their favor.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
