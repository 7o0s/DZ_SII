Not only was Die Hard an excellent if slightly antiquated choice, but NOLF was one of my favorite shooters of all time. The resulting combination, I thought, was sure to be, if not a runaway success, at least reasonably enjoyable. For the record, I have been known to be wrong from time to time.  For those of you who haven't read the back of the box yet, Die Hard is a first-person shooter based on the fourteen-year-old movie of the same name. NYPD cop John McCLane has come to the West Coast to try to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly. He goes to Holly's company's Christmas party in a high-rise office building. A group of terrorists seizes the building and now it's up to John to take them on single-handedly while somehow trying to patch things up with the missus.  For a game based on a movie, Die Hard is really faithful not just to the overall arc of the story but to many of the particulars as well. All your favorite characters are here, from Argyle to Gruber to Powell to that other guy. The soundalike recruited to do the voice work are really pretty good and the script itself remains true to the spirit of the movie.  Out of necessity the game sort of rushes the introduction. There are only the barest hints of the relationship between John and Holly and before you know it, the terrorists are shooting people. The game never explains why John takes his shoes off in the first place and, even more irritating, the game won't let you grab his shoes before sneaking up to the roof. But hey, that's okay, once you do get shoes, they don't seem to have any effect on the game whatsoever. In any case, the game sticks pretty close to the movie.   One of the big problems with this approach though is that it makes the game far too predictable. This is particularly true of the puzzle elements. Let's see, I need to get Powell's attention before he drives away...I know! I'll throw this dead body out the window! But even if you haven't seen the film the fact that bodies you need to use or search are the only ones that don't vanish after a while is a big clue. The other puzzles in the game are pretty basic, usually just requiring that you flip a switch or find a note.  Most of the puzzles present solid barriers to your progress. Locked doors, gates, hatches and various other portals need to be passed before you can continue on. But beyond these scripted impasses, there are tons of other locked doors throughout the Plaza, leading one to wonder how in the hell the terrorists could even get to you in the first place.  The most significant deviation from the movie is the inclusion of hundreds and hundreds of terrorists. Instead of 13 terrorists, you'll be going up against a virtual army of killers all armed with machine guns. The first scene on the roof for instance features an unending procession of terrorists that are only meant to serve as motivation to figure out the puzzle that gets you off the roof. This quickly becomes a pattern for the rest of the game with waves of enemies appearing for no real reason other than to stumble into your path.  I think this was the biggest mistake in Die Hard -- at least in terms of design. Run and gun shooters are a dime a dozen on the PC (technically, they're forty or fifty dollars a piece -- it's just an expression) and Die Hard is definitely one of the weaker titles in the genre. So much more could've been accomplished by limiting the number of terrorists and focusing on finding a good time and place to take each of them out individually. While I don't typically have lots of patience for stealth-oriented games, this more restrained approach might've increased the tension and interest for me. At least it would've seemed more plausible.  Worse than the terrorists are the SWAT team members that eventually make an appearance in the building. Not only do they shoot you on sight -- you can't shoot at any of them without immediately losing the game. This eventually led me to the unscrupulous idea of letting the SWAT guys and terrorists shoot it out first. That way, maybe some of the terrorists could take out the SWAT guys without my conscience ending the game for me. Maybe it would be better if the LA SWAT teams spent a little time learning how to recognize a police badge.  This made me say a bad word. But that's okay because the language in the game is already kind of rough. I had expected it to be sanitized somewhat from the film but the developers went ahead and included the swearing and cursing of the movie in the game. Right at the start, when John pulls the fire alarm and says he's going to kiss the firemen's f&@#ing Dalmatian, I instantly had more respect for the developers' intentions. The use of this kind of language is probably offensive to some gamers and, while most of it is kind of gratuitous, it does add an air of immediacy and intensity to the game.  The team has recreated the entire Nakatomi Plaza tower for this game, even the places not shown in the film. In all, they've done a good job of varying the levels and making them seem like parts of a real office building. From the helipad on the roof to the rat-infested sewers, each level of Nakatomi Plaza is well designed. I like the offices where Takagi has his meeting with Gruber and the parking garage level is also pretty fun.      There are a few details that help bring the environment to life but, for the most part, things are plain. It's nice that the team included rolls of insulation in the unfinished upper stories but they could've used more than 8 polygons to render them. A lot of the little details actually take away from the realism. For instance, John's wristwatch always says that it's five minutes till eight, while his walkie talkie continuously insists that it's half-past eleven. The rats you see in the sewer will bleed if you shoot them but they won't ever die. Even if you shoot them for a solid minute.  For a LithTech-powered game, there are quite a few niggling frustrations in the levels. For one thing, the player model seems a little bouncy and will occasionally rebound from other objects in the environment. Running up to a banister to shoot some guys below you is a lot harder when you keep bouncing away from the railing. The corners seem somewhat sticky and I've been caught by enemies more than a few times because I couldn't move after rounding a corner. Perhaps my favorite ~feature~ is the one that has your crouching character hop up onto nearby tables. That's hilarious...or at least it would be if I were a terrorist.  There are also some basic performance issues. The system requirements seem a bit low and I noticed a stutter when running in 1024x768 on a P500 with a 32MB video card. For some strange reason my Radeon 8500 didn't want to cooperate with the game at all. There also seems to a short pause every once in a while that I assume has something to do with loading AI into the enemies ahead of you.  Perhaps that's why the levels are so small. For all the game's promise of exploring a sprawling office tower, there aren't many levels that last more than ten minutes. A few are shorter than five. While it makes sense from a standpoint of story, it's hard to get involved in the action or establish a real sense of location when you keep jumping from floor to floor with only a short cutscene to move the story along.  What did you think of Die Hard Nakatomi Plaza?  Which brings us to John's capacity for running from one end to the other without passing out. I'm not sure what the performance requirements are for New York police but John can't run more than a few seconds without starting to get winded. He doesn't slow down until his stamina meter is completely depleted and then he'll have to rest for a while. Luckily the enemies seem to be under the same restriction so you can usually out-speedwalk them in a pinch.  If you can't outwalk your enemies, you'll have to fight them. They're usually really good at finding cover in the object-rich environments (like the unfinished upper levels) but they have a strong tendency to enter rooms in a most unsafe manner. You can usually run in to a room and then back out and wait for the guys to follow you. It's cheap but it'll get you out of a lot of jams.  To those who say that mine is the greatest job in the world, I would ask them to play Die Hard for a week. There are some games you play because you love them and some games you play because it's your job. Die Hard is definitely one of the latter and I'm glad to be putting this review behind me.  What puzzles me is who gave the greenlight to a mediocre game based on a 14-year-old movie. What's next? A Rent-a-Cop mod for SWAT3? Or how about a Last Temptation of Christ adventure game. I can hear Dreamcatcher salivating already.Rather than being out and out frustrating, Die Hard is really just an exercise in tedium and even considering the game's $30 price tag, there are much better options available to the shooter fan, the puzzle fan and the franchise fan in all of us. I'd steer clear of this one and pick up a copy of No One Lives Forever instead.", "date": "May 7, 2002"}
