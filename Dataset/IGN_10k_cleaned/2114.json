It's not that I hate every single video game with a well-known brand name attached to the product.   It just seems the new generation of gamers are often so naive to immediately buy a bad product with a recognized title or name attached to it, while passing on excellent titles that don't have that mainstream hook.  Again, not every brand name game is bad as evidenced by Tony Hawk - just most of them.  It pains me to think a turd like South Park Rally outsold the innovative Chu Chu Rocket, many times over, a prime example of how many don't take a chance with that oddly named title that turns out to be a gem.  That's why I implore all those reading this review who obviously own a Dreamcast not to pass up on one of the finer Dreamcast gems releasing at a time when games for SEGA's white wonder are getting scarcer.  And when you have a top-notch, solid Dreamcast title like Ooga Booga, it's amazing we're getting exceptional titles this late in DC's life... especially for an online Dreamcast game.  The story for Ooga Booga is a simple one.  As one of the leading Kahunas for an island tribe, every full moon cycle - because that's always when kooky stuff happens - the volcano goddess Ooga Booga rises from her magical island to host a set of contests to see who is truly the strongest of the four tribes that inhabit the islands - the speedy Twitchies, the mystical Hoodoos, the all-around Hotties, and the sumo-like Fatties.  You'll participate in three contests - the every-Kahuna-for-themselves Smakahuna, the boar-busting Rodeo, and everyone's favorite, Boar Polo.  The game doesn't win a Pulitzer Prize for its story, but OB gets stellar marks for great setting and presentation.  Very colorful visuals really accentuate the whole Polynesian island jungle theme while the zany character models and animations add a lot of flavor and style to the whole graphic experience.  Though a bit simplistic, Ooga Booga's visuals are a great delight to the eyes, especially since the game screams at a solid 60 frames per second. Detail of levels and special effects aren't exactly cutting edge, but they're given more of a cartoony look that I really dig - pissed off Kahunas will stomp their feet with steam blowing from their ears, explosions always end in small puffs of white clouds, and to see Fatty run around on fire is simply a riot.  Additionally, VC went out of their way to give all the characters a lot of attitude that is most definitely demonstrated with the ability to perform your Kahuna's victory dance (nothing can beat Fatty's ~Ride The Pony~ dance).   Stage designs range from very simple (i.e. flat round island of the Fatty Tutorial) to very intricate (i.e. the high ledges and walls of the castle-like Ziggurat), but they're designed to be pretty small.  OB isn't a game about big stages where you can find the best camping spot, but mixes twitch beat-em' up skills with quick thinking tactics to create a fast but strategic multiplayer experience.  While the visuals may be a bit on the simple side, the gameplay is definitely not.  The most common game will probably be Smakahuna.  At its simplest, Smakahuna is a fairly simple game where you score points by hitting enemies with your melee weapon or with thrown shrunken heads that you collect from trees throughout the island (yeah, I know... trees that grow shrunken heads?  Who'dathunk?).  At the end of the two-minute island brawl, scores are tallied up where first, second, and third place are awarded medals for that turn, where the first Kahuna to get five or more medals wins.  Now, that sounds simple and all, but then we have the wonderful variables of spells, animals, Tikis, and cataclysms, each adding a new tactic to both use and defend against.   Spells and cataclysms will be found laying around the island to collect, and each requires some skill and strategy to properly use.  For example, when you get the lightning spell, you'll be able to cast a bolt of lightning that scores 2 points.  However, because of the static nature of lightning, if shoot a lightning bolt towards two Kahunas that are close two each other, that bolt of lightning will not only hit both targets, but it will continuously rebound off each other, multiplying score numerous times.   Tikis are large wooden monuments that can be activated by giving Tikis shrunken heads.  When the required amount is given, the Tiki will awaken and being shooting shrunken heads at nearby opponents.  You can position the Tiki to your liking and, when used in conjunction with the land mine spell, you'll have a formidable secondary attack with mines protecting the Tiki from any harm.  Cataclysms are more advanced spells that aren't offered as frequently as spells because cataclysms have the potential of doing lots of damage to everyone. Finally, there are the two animals, boars and birds, and with a swift swing of your melee weapon, you can knock them into submission allowing your character to ride them. Riding the boar not only gives your Kahuna added speed, but there's almost nothing to garner more points than ramming into opposing Kahunas.  Catch a ride on the bird and you'll be able to get a sky view of the action while firing homing shrunken heads.  If the animals sound a bit too powerful don't worry; every time you smack a boar, they get angrier and eventually their release their pent-up anger by ramming into everyone without any discretion.  While you can fire homing heads while riding a bird, you don't get as many points as firing heads will decrease the amount of time you can fly on a bird.  Additionally, you're not totally invulnerable when riding on the animals; a swift blow from a Kahuna or the proper spell will unsaddle any Kahuna from their joyride.  The developers did a great job in not only keeping the balance of all the spells, Tikis, and animals from being overwhelming, they gave each Kahuna varying skills and weaknesses so that character balance is pretty darn good.  I do feel, however, that certain characters become a bit too strong in certain areas.  For example, while a Fatty can often smack a Kahuna off a boar with one swing, it's not exactly easy to time such a hit and because of their heavy weight, Fatty can be a victim of repeated boar charges if they get trapped against a wall.  But these are minimal concerns in Smakahuna and if you can't win here, you can always try the other two highly entertaining games.  Beyond the deathmatch of Smakahuna, Ooga Booga has two additional gameplay modes.  Rodeo is my least favorite, but it's fun nonetheless.  As the name implies, riding the boar is your main goal.  Too bad there's only one boar in Rodeo and your ill-fortune triples as three other Kahunas are trying to get on the boar as well.  While you can smack opponents down, the only way you score points is by hitting someone while riding a boar or knocking a Kahuna off a boar.  Again, Rodeo is fun but when compared the best of three contests in OB, it's a somewhat aggressive version of musical chairs.  Boar Polo, my dear DC readers, is where it's at.  Select from two different types of Boar Polo fields and join up with another Kahuna with one object in mind - move a giant, round boulder through the opposing team's goal.  You can do this either by smacking it with your melee weapon or hurling shrunken heads at the boulder, but the absolutely best method is jumping on a boar and ramming the rock.  There are four boars in Boar Polo, and the sight of four players trying to drive the ~ball~ across the field with boars is one of the most entertaining sights to see.  More importantly, the physics in Boar Polo are excellent in regards to how it moves along the different levels and obstacles on the Boar Polo field.  Though Boar Polo is by far, the most entertaining game of the three, they're all very fun especially when you play online.  Although playing with three other buddies via split-screen is a riot, Ooga Booga really shines as an online multi-player game.  Without a doubt, the online experience with Ooga Booga is by far, the best I've experienced on the Dreamcast... yes, even better than NFL 2K1 and Phantasy Star Online.  With chat room included, the online gameplay is so good with only the briefest touch of lag, you will hardly notice the difference from playing offline and playing online.  I can honestly say that out of the numerous online games that I've played, only twice has lag affected the game at all.  I do have to point out that during one of those two times, I had scored 2 points within the last couple seconds of a Smakahuna match to secure the victory, but due to some latency problem, I was robbed.  But for the overwhelming large percentage, when you get online with Ooga Booga you'll be amazed with the online play.  If there are any faults - beyond the simple nature to the visuals - that can be found in Ooga Booga, it comes from being a game that's dependent on being a multi-player game.  Sure, you can play the game offline; with over 40 different one-player missions (in Tribal Trial mode) with tons of things to unlock.  By the way, to fully appreciate the game, you must beat 39th trial to unlock the absolute BEST character in the game, but as you learn through progressing the Tribal Trials, they get insanely hard.  And of course, you can take on the computer offline in a quick offline skirmish, but the AI in the offline skirmish games isn't that hard, even on the most difficult setting.  For the most part, camera angles are well-done, but for those playing with the automatic camera option, it can be a pain sometimes if you're against a wall.  Lastly, even though you have a number of spells and tactics to use, there aren't any unique attacks for each Kahuna.  But these are more gripes than actual flaws in a very solid, highly entertaining Dreamcast title.  Don't let the rather cute Ooga Booga title fool you into thinking this is kid's game.  If you own a Dreamcast and if you're really into playing online DC games, there's no question at all that Ooga Booga is a definite must-have.  Let's hope that Ooga Booga is enough of a success so that we see it on a next generation system; it would be a shame not to have other players experience the mayhem and humor of this great original, multiplayer title and be stuck with another assy brand name, kart racing game.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Sep 18, 2001"}
