But I cry foul when a company tries to push a cheap and easy game like Jenga onto a system. When the virtual version costs more than three times more than the <a actual toy, you know you've got problemslet alone the fact that most of the enjoyment is in trying to work within the confines of physics and gravity to stay in the game. Jenga: World Tour is a concept that fails right from the start. Sure, the development team poured a decent amount of effort into putting Jenga on the small screen, but it all boils down to the fact that it's wasted effort: the actual toy is far more enjoyable and accessible even with all the ~virtual~ additions put into the DS game.   It sounds corny, but hit any cocktail party or friendly social gathering and someone inevitably cracks out their Jenga set. This simple stack of blocks gives players one basic goal: knock out a block from the lower part of the stack and place it, carefully, on the top of the stack. The idea is to work balance into the structure and make sure that the weight removed gets distributed at the top in a way that the structure remains standing. If the structure topples, the game's over. Basic, to the point, and actually fun to play and watch.   Now take that idea and put it on the Nintendo DS. That's what Atari tasked Atomic Planet to do on the handheld, and the team did whatever it could to make the concept a reality on the portable system. 3D engine to accurately represent the stack of blocks? Check. Physics engine to accurately represent the balance of blocks when the weight shifts? Check. Touch screen controls to poke, push and pull blocks out of the stack? Check. Cocky bastard announcer to tell you when you screw up and make the stack crumble to the floor? Check.   Yes, Jenga is accurately represented here. But with all the necessary bells and whistles to get the game to work on the Nintendo DS, it's simply a failed project because it just isn't any fun to play on the Nintendo DS. Sure, you're getting a version of the game that can be taken anywhere, but you know what? Jenga's already pretty portable to begin with. Sure, you can't exactly set up a real game on a bus, car or train, but since you still need a careful hand on the touchscreen to poke and pull virtual pieces out of the virtual stack, this isn't really a valid argument. And when the computer opponents have zero personality and behave, well, like computers, that's not a good argument either.   Just buy the real thing. Really. The DS version is playable, but it's pointless.   There are some elements that just wouldn't be possible in the real world, like blocks that randomly turn to ice to make them slip out of the stack easier, or cement blocks to add a lot more friction. Then there are outside forces try to be a nuisance, like UFOs to zap blocks out of the stack at random intervals, or pterodactyls that try to keep you from sliding the chosen block out of the structure. Against a human opponent these elements might be tolerable, but against a computer opponent they're just irritating since the AI competition spends only a couple of seconds poking at the stack so these elements barely ever affect them. Jenga on the DS fails on the conceptual level. As full-featured as the developer tried to make this game, it simply comes down to the fact that A) it's not fun, and B) the actual game of Jenga is far more enjoyable at a third the price. Why strain your eyes on a smaller version of the stack when you can just clear some space off the kitchen table and play the real thing?", "date": "Nov 27, 2007"}
