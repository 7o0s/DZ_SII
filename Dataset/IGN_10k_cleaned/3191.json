The system was still in its infancy, and we were playing a fast, accurate 3D shooter four months after its release...who wouldn't be impressed? Classic Doom is also a lot of fun, although its presentation is definitely not nearly as elaborate as what we're accustomed to almost a decade after its initial PC release. Doom II is honestly more of the same, but at least its improved in almost every way. Still, the whole novelty of Doom on a handheld has already run its course last year, and with the sequel we're left with an overall feeling of ~been there, done that.~ Features 30 levels 17 different enemies Link cable support, two player co-op, four player deathmatch (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (four slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Last year's GBA version of Doom was pulled off by a development team as David A. Palmer Productions, and it was definitely a quality product. The game flowed relatively smoothly with a good amount of on-screen enemies, decent lighting effects, and a good, if somewhat rushed, multiplayer mode. The game retained most of the gameplay elements that made Doom such a success on the PC and the umpteen ports on the other different gaming platforms. But what's more, it gave GBA owners an early view of what their handheld is capable of beyond the traditional side-scrollers and Mode-7 racers. It was indeed impressive to take Doom on the go.  This year, Activision commissioned Australian developer Torus Games to bring the PC Doom II sequel to the Game Boy Advance. The development team already had an impressive first-person shooter under its belt, Duke Nukem Advance, so moving the lesser-complex Doom gameplay to their Duke Nukem Advance engine most likely wasn't a terribly complex feat. The result is a sequel to Doom that offers a slightly improved framerate and higher resolution textures, but barely moves the series forward with any real gameplay improvements. The game is still Doom, though there's now a more powerful shotgun and a handful of new enemies.  The game is still a lot of fun for anyone looking for a mindless romp through several different corridor-structured areas, as Doom II's only real puzzles come in the form of ~find a switch that will open a door/raise the elevator.~ The main fun comes from blazing through the darkness and turning the enemies into Swiss cheese and green goop with the different weapons acquired in the areas. But it just seems like a step backwards to revert back to the basic Doom design after playing through FPS games like Duke Nukem Advance and Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever that offer much more to their presentation. More variety means a better gaming experience, and the Doom structure has definitely aged.  Doom II is a definite improvement over the original Doom, but its impact in the Game Boy Advance market is much less pronounced from the first game because, honestly, the sequel on the PC wasn't much more than a slight upgrade from the first game. This game still lacks a real story or gameplay elements beyond the ~hit the switch/grab the keycard/blast the enemies~ design. But if all you're looking for is a mindless shooter, Doom II will definitely fit the bill.", "date": "Nov 13, 2002"}
