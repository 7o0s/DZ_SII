{"name": "Hellgate: London", "name_review": "Hellgate: London Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/05/hellgate-london-review", "text": "So if you read last Friday's impressions of Hellgate: London, you know that we were hoping to spend a little more time with the game before finally rendering our ultimate verdict. Well, after a few more days with the title, we're firmly convinced that our initial impressions weren't far off the mark. The action RPG scores high in terms of atmosphere and the quantity and quality of monsters and loot, but falls far below the mark owing to repetitive combat, generic levels and a multiplayer system that adds little to the single player experience.  If you're getting here late, you deserve to be told that Hellgate is set in a future London where groups of Knights Templar strike out from their bases in the London subway system at the forces of Hell that have taken over the rest of the city. It sounds like an awesome premise and one that's ideally suited for the action-RPG format that the Flagship folks created for the Diablo franchise all those many years ago.   Sadly, there's far too much action and not nearly enough story in Hellgate. Most of the time players are simply wandering from level to level killing anything that moves with no more understanding of what's going on than the simple one-line quest instructions provide. The actual content of the story is provided by any one of a number of interchangeable quest-giving NPCs you meet in the world. It's true that a few of the quest-givers stand out as particularly memorable and, yes, it's true that a few story elements actually play during a mission, but really, the whole story here seems to be an excuse to smash demons which, to our way of thinking at least, seems a bit backwards.  Assuming you don't care as much about things like story, then you're likely to appreciate the high level of action that Hellgate constantly throws your way. There is no shortage of combat in Hellgate: London, so from the instant you step into your first level, you'll be fighting against a range of zombies, flying brains, gun-toting demons and pale ladies with electric tentacles. Every place you go is packed full of enemies who have nothing better to do that to sit around all day waiting for you to show up and kill them. In fact, you can barely walk twenty feet through London without being confronted with some sort of hellspawn that you can hone your skills on.  Since Hellgate offers a skill based system like those of most MMOs rather than a complex move system found in your typical fighting or action games, the combats can tend to get a little repetitive, at least on your end. It's true that you'll be confronted with a variety of enemies who all have unique modes of attack but your own options tend to become fairly predictable, particularly if you're focused on reaching the maximum upgrade level for your skills.   The good news is that there's quite a bit of variety among the different classes you can play. Whether you want to shoot fireballs or bullets at stuff from afar, stab them from close in, or even summon mechanical or magical pets to do your bidding for you, there are a number of interesting class options in Hellgate. Naturally each class has a downside as well -- the ranged attackers, for instance, don't seem to be able to deal out the massive damage that the melee fighters can, but then again, they don't find themselves swarmed with enemies nearly as often. Fortunately, it seems that any class can handle the action here, if properly equipped and upgraded.  I definitely love the whole dynamic of collecting loot and leveling up my character's stats and tinkering with my items to see just how much of a badass I could become, at the end of the day Hellgate is an RPG game in an action format, not the other way around. This means that, while you'll have to worry about hiding behind telephone booths when you're being shot at, your effectiveness is driven more by the weapons you're wielding and the skills you're using than on your own hand-eye coordination. Twitchy players might grow weary of this sooner than most, but it definitely allows for a more dramatic increase in ass-kicking potential. The moment you take your newly tweaked character out into the streets and find yourself taking down monsters you used to run from in a single hit, you'll be hooked.      The range of cool items here is impressive and the thought that went into the naming system, the various properties and overall quality of items is something that other developers should strive to emulate. Tons of different types of boots, swords, guns, belts, and so forth all come with specific mundane capabilities and in most cases one or more amazing magical effects. Some armors increase your regeneration rate, or protect you from specific damage types, or increase your speed. Some weapons give you better critical hit rates, or better range, or unusual damage types. Finding an item that gives you a weird combination of bonuses is a real joy and trying to pick and choose how to outfit yourself is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game. Happily, the game allows you to equip three different weapon groups so you can switch back and forth between them on the fly.  We do, however, have two serious problems with the loot system. First, the upgrade system means you can do a great job keeping your current weapons from becoming obsolete even as you find more and more impressive items. So basically by the middle of the game, you'll have found a weapon combination that you're likely to stick with to the end. That means you don't confront new weapons by wondering what they do so much as by wondering how much you can sell them for.   The second, and much more frustrating problem, is that the amount of stuff you grab in this game constantly forces you into conflict with the game's absolutely terrible inventory system. Very often in our world we have to allow that there can be differences of opinion with regard to certain game features. Just because I don't like something doesn't mean that it might not be someone else's favorite feature. That's not the case with Hellgate's inventory system, which is objectively and obviously terrible.  Large items find their way into your grid based inventory space without regard for making the most of the space you have available. You'll frequently (and we mean frequently) find yourself unable to loot new items because the stuff you've already collected has filled up your inventory in a less than efficient way. Having to pause to rearrange everything just so you can make room for your new boots just kills the momentum built up by the combat. I only hope that the lack of an autosort button is an oversight and not a conscious omission on the part of the developers. On the plus side, you can at least teleport back to a nearby station instantly to sell the stuff you've accumulated and then hop right back into the action where you left off.  Almost all of the levels in Hellgate are generated randomly so the player won't know exactly what they're facing until they step inside. This definitely adds to the discovery element during multiplayer, but while the geometries change, the game creates the levels using a system of modular components that get very, very repetitive. Players will soon learn to dread the appearance of yet another subway platform, yet another three story house, and yet pointless hallway with a statue at the end of it. Ultimately, you can sense the lack of a design in these spaces and it makes them grow tedious very quickly. It also means that the game doesn't feel any more like London than any other city. When the game does move the player into a consciously designed space that makes use of the London setting, the difference is as stark as night and day.   The random design extends to item and boss placement. On more than one occasion we've prepared ourselves to enter a particularly dangerous area only to discover that the item we were looking for was waiting for us right inside the entrance. In other cases we've been tasked with activating multiple items within a level and found them all grouped together in a rather unimportant and unguarded section of the map. It might be easy, but it sure isn't fun.  Finally, much has been made of Hellgate's multiplayer component and its attempts to evoke the appeal of the traditional MMO. In some ways, they've succeeded admirably. Excusing the typical server woes that plague the launch of any large shared space, Hellgate runs reasonably well. Dan and I are of course aggravated that we didn't log in quickly enough to secure the names Ham and Beans, but apart from that, the launch seems to have finally settled down a bit. We're still sometimes finding ourselves mysteriously stuck in the floor when we transport back to the stations and we're still getting the odd memory-related crashes but many of the other bugs seem to be clearing up already.      By design, the main subway stations are public spaces shared by all players but they're small enough that the game needs to run multiple instances to prevent overcrowding. It's nice to have a little breathing room but it seems to detract from some of the appeal that you're not confronted with more players. Moreover, the lack of a good party finding option means you'll really have to work to get connected with a group of people. If you happen to find yourself on a different instance than your friends, you can use the typical MMO commands to join together across instances and reunite once you reach the party's instanced adventure space.  When you do get a good party together, you can definitely see some interesting synergies develop but since most of the classes were designed to play solo, you'll never really feel like you necessarily need any of these other people to get the job done. They're basically just there to take care of the extra monsters. Still, it's true that you'll be having fun fighting alongside your friends and kicking more ass with them than you ever could without. And since it's free, what do you have to lose?  Hellgate plans to offer a paid subscription model that includes all sorts of extra content down the line but we honestly don't see how it could substantially increase our interest in returning to the tunnels beneath London. We'll definitely be watching how it develops over the coming months but we're not holding our breath.   Visually speaking, Hellgate has a fantastic sense of atmosphere and some strong visual designs. I particularly like the monsters, each of which looks like a terrifying creature that might very well have come from Hell. The mood of the outdoor riverbed areas is definitely breathtaking. Seeing the moon high up in the clouds and the pilings of the bridges and the towers and buildings on the banks above is one of the few moments where you really believe that this could be London.  Your own character is equally impressive. The range of equipable items is vast and they all seem to work well together according to some underlying aesthetic that we can't quite put our fingers on. It's part high fantasy, part Road Warrior and Matrix. Sadly, the combat animations aren't the best and since you'll be seeing them a lot (a lot), it's a weakness that confronts you at every turn.  We were finally able to get the game up and running with the DX10 effects and they do make a difference. The biggest and most obvious improvement is the subtle depth of field effects that you'll see in the larger locations, but there are plenty of other interesting tweaks worth appreciating. The downside of course, is that the DX9 version runs so much better that it's not worth the drop in frame rate for the better overall image.  Some of the sounds in Hellgate could use a bit more weight and presence, particularly in terms of the firearms. We just weren't ever really convinced that these guns were as deadly as they ought to have been because the overall booming quality was simply missing. The voices are generally good enough to get the job done with at least a few standouts that really chew into their parts.At the end of the day Hellgate: London delivers an experience that is fun for a few hours but quickly grows repetitive. The stat-driven combat takes the player one step away from the action and the modular levels and peripheral nature of the story keeps players from investing in the world. Balanced against that are levels that are virtually teeming with enemies and a loot and upgrade system that gives you a real sense of progress every minute that you play. Your own enjoyment of Hellgate will naturally depend on your tolerance for the repetitious levels and your overall desire to find the perfect combination of skills and items that will allow you to take on the toughest of the game's challenges with ease. Unfortunately for Hellgate, our tolerance and desire levels just aren't what they used to be.", "date": "Nov 5, 2007"}
