Likewise, Star Wars toys, comics, novels, stuffed animals, Yoda Furbies, and everything related to Star Wars, are going to succeed. There's no question. Even with PC games, LucasArts almost always comes through with exceptional games. But when it comes to console games, LucasArts is like a fish out of water. A wookie without a yowl. Yoda with a full head of hair. The closest it got was with Nintendo 64's Rogue Squadron, and even that wasn't brilliant, it was just good.   LucasArts' latest offering for PlayStation once again fails to lift the company's console reputation out of the Dagobah swamps. Despite our enthusiasm for LucasArts' efforts, and our pure desire to want this game to be good, even the Force can't turn poor game design into good game design.   Jedi Power Battles follows the storyline of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, while putting you into the robes of five different Jedi Masters from the movie. You can choose from Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, Plo Koon, and Adi Gallia. With your lightsaber in hand, you run through stages based on movie locations while destroying everything in your path. As cool as this may sound, the game just falls apart from the instant you turn it on.   Gameplay Jedi Power Battles is basically a Final Fight clone, but with a Star Wars theme. Remember Super Star Wars? Well, this is kinda like that, too, except not as good. In order to throw in some variety, LucasArts adds weapon power-ups, combo moves, Force powers, and platform jumping. Playing in either one- to two-player modes, you fight the forces of the evil Trade Federation, and eventually duel Darth Maul.  All of that would make a fun game, if only the controls weren't so awful. First, there's the ~lock on~ feature. By pressing R1, you lock on to the nearest enemy; this enables you to focus on an enemy in the free-moving 3D environment. The feature is loose and inconsistent. Sometimes you lock onto an enemy, and other times, you lock onto the air next to him, giving the Droid an excellent free shot at you. This becomes extremely annoying when you're tying to chop down an enemy in a group.   The annoying controls, however, don't ruin the game on their own. The animations help quite a bit, too. This is the kind of game that requires fast action combat. When you swing or thrust, nothing should get in your way, especially not the game. But here, character animations actually hinder your attacks. If you swing and miss, you won't be swinging again until the previous animation has been completed. While the animation sequences look great on their own, once you enter battle, they actually get in your way because they're too long and can't be interrupted while fighting.   The next element of the game that's absolutely crucial to success is jumping. More often than not, its hard to judge how far you need to leap. That happens sometimes in games, and if the game rewards you for learning the skills to play it and enables you to judge, through experience, the length of the jumps, it's forgivable. But with Jedi Power Battles, the collision detection is so bad that sometimes it appears that you have landed on solid ground, but in reality you haven't. You-sa gonna die lotsa. Throughout the 10 levels, there are numerous areas to jump to and from, and the control, and collision detection is consistently poor, and practically forces death upon you. On top of that, every single time you die all the enemies in the level return. That means you have to chop you way through them all over again just to get the same point where you died just to lose yet another life due to the horrid controls.   (If this seems like a rant, well...it is. The fact is, we would love to play a great LucasArts console game, but each one disappoints worse than the last.)   So what do we like about Jedi Power Battles? Honestly, the first five minutes, and that's about it. After that it's all downhill. Each Jedi has his or her own combo moves, and each one on their own is great looking, and really gives you the feel of playing as a Jedi. But combos are tough to pull off because of that little animation problem. When you manage to do one, they are somewhat impressive and do slice and dice the enemies quite nicely. Another cool thing is the ability to reflect laser blasts back to their target with your light sabre. If you time, and aim, a block perfectly, the blast will ricochet back to the enemies, sometimes destroying them in one hit (if they are weak enough). Also, some of the lightsaber power-ups are sweet. One power-up extends the length of the beam to about twice the normal length, which looks great, and works just swell.   While running through the levels, many objects in the backgrounds can be destroyed and some will give you points for doing so. All gamers have the knack for destroying stuff, and this game gives that chance to bash all sorts of machinery. The only disappointing thing about this is Jar Jar. (And we know this a controversial point, but we simply must say it here...) When Jar Jar is standing right next to you, he is just about the only thing you can't damage. If you were able to beat him down with your lightsaber, Jedi Power Battles may have had a redeeming feature.   Graphics The list of things we could discuss here is endless, but we'll just name a few. There are bad, bad, bad! (bad!) collision problems with the backgrounds, which obviously affects gameplay. Polygons overlap often, giving the environments a sloppy look. Also, most of the enemy polygon models are constructed with very few polys, making them appear simple and crude in look. Worse yet, the camera can be very problematic, at times hiding an enemy that you must destroy in order to continue to the next screen.   Just wait until you start playing the game with a second player. Both characters can actually depart from the screen, leaving it blank. (Hey, Obi Wan? Where the hell are you?) And if you thought the jumping was horrible with just one person, just wait until you try it with two. We suggest buying a punching bag simultaneously with this game, so you have something to take your aggression out on. Otherwise your little brother is going to be really unhappy.   There are some positive things about the graphics. First, each Jedi's character model is actually pretty good when compared to the rest of the game. Next, there are some good special effects. When you cut down an enemy with a lightsaber, the electricity in the air glows and sparkles. And as we said, the animations of the attacks -- on their own -- are cool, too.   Sound If there is one area where nearly every Star Wars game excels, it's sound. Star Wars would not be Star Wars without the classic music of John Williams. The same thing can be said about a game based on Star Wars: If the music isn't based on the films, the game just doesn't feel right. Thankfully, every music track in the game is taken directly from the movie soundtrack, and it sounds all over. As with the music, the sound effects come directly from the movie.  Jedi Power Battles had the potential to become the best Star Wars game on PlayStation. Then again, every LucasArts games has that potential, and the good folks at LucasArts missed their calling with Jedi Power Battles.Something happened along the line, and the concept of control was lost. With graphic glitches and some of the worst and unresponsive controls in a PS game, this is one Star Wars game that even hardcore fans should stay far away from. If LucasArts could just return to its roots and make some games as good as Tie Fighter, Sam & Maxx Hit the Road, and Jedi Knight, Star Wars games wouldn't be laughed at so often. We can always hope that the company's PS2 efforts are better.", "date": "Apr 7, 2000"}
