(Well, there are more, only I'm talking about two right now.) 1) Roller coasters are fun. 2) There are few computer games out there that simulate roller coasters. If you are thinking, ~Hey I'd like to run around and kill things,~ then there are lots of choices for you. Tons. But if building your own park is your cup o' tea, then your options are limited. The down side to this, besides the obvious that there is a roller coaster niche that still has plenty of elbow room, is that if one company does it mind-bogglingly well (you know what game I speak of), one tends to compare every other game with the Big One. Even if the game in question is not like the Big One.    I will warn you that it is tough to play this game and not think longingly of That Game. If you are waiting for Big Game 2, then keep your britches on till October. If you are interested in a simple, fun roller coaster creation game with no tedious park managing worries, budget worries, and people-freaking-cause-the-ride-is-too-scary worries, then Disney and Gigawatt have brought you Ultimate Ride Coaster Deluxe.    You have two options for play: the ~Imagineer~ option, which has you building a coaster with goals in mind, such as pass through all the rings, setting the minimum or maximum height, limiting the Gs, etc. Although some may find that part challenging, my coasters tended to ignore fun for the ~finish in any way possible~ slant. So what if the coaster ended with lots of non-hilly curvy bits? I passed through all the rings, didn't I???    I much preferred the simple ~Build~ option, where I can play around with coasters and not worry about goals (except for finishing it), budgets, or anything. And heck, I don't even need to worry about finishing it, because you can test your coaster at any time, whether you finish it or not. It was refreshing to discover how easy it is to make a roller coaster. The interface is very easy to use, with rollover instructions if you are unable to discern what the different buttons are for.    The physics engine is well done; you can make the wackiest coaster you can think of, but if you are not moving fast enough, your coaster will slow down and then begin to move backwards. To combat the feeling of spending a lot of time on a coaster only to have it die on the second hill, there was an excellent feature implemented: you are able to test your coaster mid-build, regardless of whether you're done or not. The building tools also come with a track lengthener and shortener, which is excellent for those of us who have great fun building these grand coasters only to be completely inept at matching the last piece of track up to the starting point. I'm not naming any names, but there was some swearing inside the office before that little gem was noticed.    The fun of the game of course comes when you get to ride your coaster in first person (there are other camera angles as well, but who needs 'em? We want the full experience!). While the graphics in the background and the incidental park decorations you can put down are sometimes blocky, the actual coaster graphics are quite nice, and often you want to throw your hands up and yell ~Wheeee!~ Or maybe that's just me. But it's fun.   I had a bit of issue with the game music -- some tracks had the dreamy-creepy-rock ballad feel of a bad sci-fi movie. You're experiencing something fast and exciting, but the sounds you hear are relaxing. It implies a drug-induced state that I'm not sure Disney would endorse.    What did you think of Ultimate Ride Coaster Deluxe?   Another issue I will bring up: these less-expensive titles putting the game manual on the game CD instead of printed inside the box. So your choices are either, A) figure out the game on your own, hoping the interface is user-friendly enough, B) take time to print out the manual yourself, or C) stop play, bring up the manual, and puzzle out the game if you hit a snag. Let's be honest, most gamers are going to just dive right in; they do it anyway even if they have a printed manual. But the other two options are a little unfair. I do understand that manuals cost money, as much as $1 extra per game (which adds up to a lot when you're shipping 100K copies of a game), but pass the price on to the customer. Even though these are budget games, it's worth it to pay $21 for a game with a manual than $20 for a game with no manual. As long as you keep the realities of the game in mind (that it's a coaster builder and rider, that's it) then you should be able to have a good bit of fun with this game. The interface is easy to use, and the variety of landscapes is good enough to add some spice. For those of us who aren't going to make it to a theme park this summer, this is a pretty good standby. Although they could have shipped it with some cotton candy.", "date": "Jun 24, 2002"}
