They've now released the third title in the series, Combat Mission: Afrika Korps. This is the final title the developers plan to release using the current technology; Combat Mission 2 will be built on entirely new graphics and AI engines.  This time around the developers have offered up an entirely new theater of war. Players can now fight the battles of World War II around the Mediterranean -- from the tank duels of North Africa to the mountain combat of Italy to the paratrooper engagements in Crete. These new areas expand on the action of the previous game by offering up some large, flat areas for a highly mechanized form of war, as well as offering up some intense defensive fights in the rugged mountains of Italy. Players will field thousands of units from the American, British, Canadian, Australian, Polish, French, South African and New Zealander (New Zealandic? New Zealish?) armies. The two Axis powers of Germany and Italy sit in opposition to the Allied units.  The 60 or so scenarios in the game range from miniscule to gargantuan and the six mammoth operations (composed of linked scenarios with persistent units) offer a wealth of replayability. Not only are there some significant historical and fictional battles here -- the designers have even included such treats as missions based off of movies. The assault on the farmhouse from Lewis Milestone's A Walk in the Sun is a real treat. (For those who haven's seen the movie, imagine Saving Private Ryan done sixty years ago with Lloyd Bridges and less cursing.) Additionally, some of the scenarios are specifically designed for head-to-head play, making them a real treat for multiplay.  Perhaps as a concession to ease of entry, the game now arrives without the obligatory 200-page manual. Though the old manual explained many of the ideas behind the game quite well, it did tend to drag on a bit. The 30-page affair that takes its place does a remarkably good job of outlining the game concepts but players who are new to the series should definitely check out the tutorial before venturing too far into the scenarios. The cover of the manual includes all the hot keys you'll need to know which makes things a bit easier on newer players as well.  What makes Combat Mission so daunting isn't the range of controls; these are easy enough to grasp after a few missions. No, what makes it somewhat difficult for new players to embrace is that it doesn't work according to the same assumptions you use in other games. Combat Mission is as much about intelligence as it is about speed and economy. You have to have a strong sense of what's possible in the real world before you can begin to really grasp the game. The best players are those that are conscious of things like cover and concealment, cohesion and dispersal, as well as topography and a bit of psychology. Afrika Korps works under the same rules that apply in the real world. That's what separates it from more traditional strategy games.   Afrika Korps also differs in terms of its pace and presentation. It offers a hybrid turn-based and real-time simulation that lets players think about their orders but still enjoy the momentum of real-time play. You'll issue orders to your units in between these action phases. (Unlike Barbarossa to Berlin there are no new commands to play with.) Once you (and your opponent) are done issuing commands, the action plays out for a full minute before pausing to let you add or edit commands.      This is the third and last game built on the original Combat Mission engine. Though it was never quite on par with the graphics seen in most other 3D real-time strategy games, it's still an impressive visual presentation given the wealth of units rendered and the range of environmental features. (We've been told that the first game built on the new Combat Mission engine, currently known as CMX2, will be out within two years and that it will meet the current standard for graphics. Whether that means today's current or the current in two years remains to be seen but, as we've said, the game isn't necessarily about the graphics.)  But fans of games like C&C: Generals or Empires: Dawn of the Modern World will nevertheless find Afrika Korps's graphics weak in comparison. The cross-poly built trees and rocks seems dated as do the spritish smoke and dust textures. The actual units look quite authentic and the explosions and weapon effects are sufficient but not spectacular. Sound is also a bit flat at points, but the authentic weapon and engine sounds are supplemented by some thoroughly convincing voicework.  Though the engine is definitely showing its age, there is one addition that veteran Combat Mission players will notice right away -- the vehicles kick up dust as they tear across the desert. Not only does this look extremely cool, but it also helps you spot enemy units a lot quicker from the large dust clouds they send up. The dust drifts along as your units move through it, enhancing the realism. The other changes, like the addition of multi-turreted vehicles or the numerous and slight changes to ballistics and tactical AI really only start to appear after you've played it for a while.  In addition to deserts, players will find vineyards on the map. These are a bit like graveyards in terms of concealment and movement penalties, but unlike graveyards, they provide absolutely no cover. In other words, they make great places to hide but terrible places to fight.   And speaking of terrible places to fight, the deserts of North Africa present an unusual challenge. While the streets and steepes of the previous game offered a chance to advance under cover, the wide open expanses of desert found here offer virtually no cover at all. The maps (which are much bigger now as a rule), need to be crossed with care and I'm still watching the AI and reading some After Action Reports to get a sense of how to get all the way across a completely flat desert without losing all of my tanks. Luckily the tactical AI seems to have a handle on it. Though not nearly as groundbreaking as the previous titles Afrika Korps definitely adds another layer of refinement to the series and offers up some intriguing battles in some new areas. At this point the game is in dire need of better graphics but, beyond that, it's still the best PC wargame on the market. I find it hard to resist the urge to keep playing even as other games find their way onto my desktop. The few tiny discrepancies that have found their way in won't bother anyone except hardcore purists (who make up an astonishingly large percentage of the game's audience). Whatever inconsistencies they are in the Orders of Battles are easily forgivable given the scope of the projectAfrika Korps, along with Beyond Overlord and Barbarossa to Berlin, belong on every wargamer's wish list. With Afrika Korps coming in at a comfortable $35 right off the battlefront.com website, fans of the previous game shouldn't pass this one up. It's also offered with Barbarossa to Berlin for only $60. Given the fact that I'm still playing both games, that's not a bad deal.", "date": "Jan 10, 2004"}
