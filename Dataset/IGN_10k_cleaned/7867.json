Why would anyone attempt a keg stand on a mobile game when the intended audience is likely doing the real thing every weekend?   Developed by Nephin Games and based on the Game Show Network's ~outrageous~ series of the same name, Greek Games befits recent National Lampoon efforts like Van Wilder and Dorm Daze - namely, it's astonishingly lame.   As you might expect, Greek Games offers a quartet of frat party events (Keg Toss, Steak Toss, Keg Stand, and the seemingly titillating Lube Luge) in ten different game modes, none of which make the tedious events any more interesting.  Within fifteen minutes I'd tried every event at least three times and hated all of them.   The Keg Toss involves using the standard-issue power and distance meters to launch a keg, the results of which are judged by distance or height.   The Keg Stand is either a log roll-style race or, in the ~Combat~ mode, a head-to-head battle against an opponent that will cause the makers of the Dead or Alive games to lose absolutely no sleep.  While the struggle to stay balanced by constantly pressing the 4 and 5 buttons keeps your fingers busy, it can't rightly be called ~fun.~  Tapping 5 again to swing your mallet when your opponent rolls close doesn't really qualify as a scintillating fight maneuver, either.   In the Steak Toss, a bikini-clad babe with a body that's supposed to be buff but looks more like a flesh-colored Michelin Man holds a pot while you toss a steak into it.  If you over- or undershoot on the power meter, a seagull or rat intercepts the steak.  That's as wacky as the game ever gets, and it doesn't even rate a chortle.   Most baffling is the Lube Luge.  Here's how it works: you press 5 to get your frat-stud running.  Press 5 again whenever the sliding pointer hits one of the green ends of the meter at the bottom of the screen to build up speed.  Then hit 5 once more at the end of the track to launch frat-stud over the water slide.  Use the 2 and 8 keys to guide frat-stud into globs of lube to speed up, and away from the piles of sand that slow you down.  Are we having fun yet?   But, wait - there's more!  If you tire of the Speed mode, you can try for distance or attempt to collect as many pins as possible while struggling in vain to keep your eyelids from snapping shut.   As I slogged through the events, I wondered who at any point in its development thought they had a winner on their hands.  The simplistic events don't offer enough challenges to make them difficult, nor sufficient rewards to warrant replay.  If you've never played a single video game in your entire life, you might be awed to see your character hurl a keg when you press a button.  Otherwise, you will be bored to tears.   With the ~Community~ option, Greek Games wants you to interface with your friends: compete against one another via a network connection, send each other messages, and offer awards.  If one of your friends encourages you to join his network and play National Lampoon's Greek Games, give him the Lamest Friend Ever Award.  Any of these events could be fun, drunken wackiness at a real-life frat party, where at least you'd be too drunk to know if they weren't.  As a video game, however, Greek Games is a total failure, unless your idea of a great time is mashing the 5 button on your phone while Sega Master System-quality graphics scroll tediously past, with unimpressive results.", "date": "Dec 21, 2006"}
