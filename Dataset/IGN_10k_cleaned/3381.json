Unfortunately, some of these games actually get made by aspiring game developers, like Super Bubble Pop for the Game Boy Advance. What probably looked like a great idea on paper is, in practice, a lame and unexciting puzzle game with absolutely no variety in gameplay options. This game would have been better suited as a mini-game in a much larger production...it just can't stand on its own. Features Four playable characters Four difficulty levels Cartridge save for high scores Only for Game Boy Advance  So, the idea in Super Bubble Pop is to maneuver one of the four selectable characters along the bottom of a nine-by-nine square grid, tossing colored bubbles towards the rear of the playfield. The bubble in question will stop if it hits another bubble, stacking up underneath the bubble it collided into; the idea is to ~pop~ bubbles by linking three of the same colors either in the same column vertically, or horizontally spread across other columns. If the stack gets more than six bubbles high, that column will freeze in place and cause any bubbles to collide into it to stack into the square in front of it; if the stacks of bubbles reaches the front of the playing field, the game's over. The action gets increasingly difficult, especially when there are piles of bubbles on-screen, as the playfield starts to shift towards the player.  To win the game, all players have to do is to either a) clear out an entire field of bubbles, or b) collect enough tokens to move on.  That's the basics. The game designers throw a few spices into the mix by adding random power-ups that can change the colors of a column, flip the colors in a stack, freeze a row in place, or other weird effects; the problem here is, when you've obtained a power-up, it only tells you what it is for a brief second or two in small text that's washed out at the bottom of the screen. The only real indication on which power-up you've got in your queue is via a very poor icon representation in the corner of the screen. It's pretty bad because the game designers want this game to be an intense experience, and by making that icon difficult to read, it pulls the gamer out of the ~zone~ just to figure out what type of power-up he can use at that time.    But the problems of Super Bubble Pop go deeper than that. Though the design tries to offer an energetic gaming experience, it's all thrown out the window due to one design flaw: player's play speed is restricted to the animation of the character at the bottom of the screen. In other words, players can't move through the different rows of the grid as fast as their thumb can take them, because the character won't move until it's finished its side-step animation. And while that might be a matter of milliseconds, its still affects fast-paced play. And since there are only five colored bubbles, and there are so many possible places to place a colored bubble, it's almost a challenge in losing some rounds; just by holding down the action button players can throw an endless stream of bubbles, and the chances are very high that the player will score a link.   Stack all of these issues on top of the fact that there are literally no gameplay options beyond changing the difficulty level, and you've got yourself one seriously lacking puzzle game. The Game Boy Advance version doesn't even feature the same two-player mode that the console versions have, nor does it feature any sort of tutorial to give players an idea of what the designers actually intended with Super Bubble Pop's gameplay. The Game Boy Advance system is a great home to puzzle games like Tetris or Puyo Pop. But just because Super Bubble Pop is a puzzle game for the Game Boy Advance doesn't logically mean it works on the system; the design is extremely shallow and unrewarding. There are much better puzzle games released on teh system that are more worth the play time.", "date": "Jan 17, 2003"}
