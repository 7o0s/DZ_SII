Each publisher clashes in all of the important categories -- football, baseball, and golf -- trading blows with respective entries. Madden versus Reggie Bush. Tiger versus Vijay. And now EA's MVP Baseball (formerly JAMDAT Sports LMB) is up against Gameloft's Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2007 -- and the match-up this time is distinctly lopsided. Gameloft's baseball game has no peer on the decks this spring. It is, without need for debate, the best baseball game of the season and will be enjoyed by every fan of the sport with a cellphone.   Pro Baseball 2007 succeeds because even though the contest between the batter and pitcher is the prime focus of the game, it does not come at the expense of fielding and base running. No aspect of the entire package is neglected, from the presentation to the obligatory home run derby. The visuals are decidedly polished; the batter models look great, the stadiums are nicely detailed, and the animations are smooth. For the record: We played this game on a Java-enabled Sony Ericsson handset, too, so the comparison between Pro Baseball 2007 and MVP would be fair.   When you first boot up Pro Baseball 2007, you can either hop right into an Exhibition match to learn the fundamentals or try out your favorite team in a season or playoffs. If you opt for the season, you can skip any game of your choosing by selecting a simulation that matches each team's stats to determine a reasonable outcome. The playoffs essentially follow the chase for the World Series, but without the need to pay for an MLB license. Pro Baseball 2007's only real world player is indeed Derek Jeter, but each fictional team is made-up of players with appropriate stats. New York, for example, is loaded with talent while Seattle performs respectably.   When batting, you choose between a regular swing, power hit or a bunt. By holding down 5, you essentially rev up your swing (depicted by the circling bat) and release when the ball rips through the strike zone. You can try to affect the direction of your hit by tapping 2, 4, 6, or 8 before pressing 5 for the hit. This makes hitting a desirable grounder much easier. Depending on the difficulty level selected before the match, you get a little clue when the ball is over the plate and ready for a hit. When the box around the strike zone flashes green, hit or release 5 to make contact. If you are playing on pro, though, you get no such help. You just have to watch the ball as it flies over the plate and time your swing.   It's important to note Gameloft's decision to slow down the pitching depending on your difficulty setting, too. On the easy settings, the ball almost leisurely crosses the plate. This really drains the drama from the battle, but I think casual players will appreciate the chance to not be run roughshod over upon first download. Try out a few three-inning exhibition games on easy to get a feel for the batting and then juice the difficulty to make the game a fairer fight.   As the pitcher, you have four different pitches, each assigned to a cardinal direction. Once selected, you position a ball icon around the strike zone. Once the ball is where you want it, press the 5 key to start filling up a power meter. After tapping 5 to select power, the meter starts moving the opposite direction. Press 5 again to decided the pitch accuracy. The closer you are to the center of the green zone, the more accurate your pitch. You only have one shot, though. Unlike the pulsing power meter, the accuracy mark only slides along the meter once. If you miss the green zone, the pitch goes wild. Over the course of a game, keep an eye on your pitcher's fatigue meter. If he gets sloppy, send him to the dugout and try a fresh arm.   On the easiest settings, fielding is automated. You can control the fielding manually on the tougher difficulty levels, and I recommend you do so. Manual fielding is frustrating. I want to be in charge of my own mistakes and on easy, I never felt my outfielders were quick enough to move for a grounder or get under a pop fly. Base running is always manual and easily controlled by the 2, 4, 6, and 8 keys for advancing individual bases, or press 7 and 9 to have all players either advance or retreat respectively.   The game plays incredibly well from the get-go. It only took me a couple innings to get all of the control options down. By the second game, I was throwing ace sliders right along the southern end of the strike zone to fool batters. But no victory on the harder settings was a cakewalk. Pro Baseball 2007 gives as good as it gets and you'll be seriously challenged when the AI-controlled team goes on a hot streak. You just have to knuckle down and make the right plays to break their stride and stop a runaway game. I also like that while I certainly hit my fair share of homers, it never devolved into Slugfest. This is a smart and fair sim.   As mentioned earlier, Pro Baseball 2007 looks fantastic. From the smartly animated batter models to the callout windows that tracks on-base runners, Pro Baseball 2007 has style. The stadium crowds are animated, especially at big plays. You'll often spy camera flashes in the bleachers. The pitching meters, stats, and on-screen tips are easy to read. Pro Baseball 2007 also features great digitized speech and musical cues, such as the classic charge you so often hear over a stadium organ.  When EA Mobile's MVP Baseball 07 was tagged out last month, there was a vacancy at the top of the mobile baseball roster. Gameloft handily fills the slot with Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2007. This game swings serious lumber like its cover athlete and should be your only serious choice when downloading a baseball game for your handset this spring.", "date": "Apr 6, 2007"}
