{"name": "FEAR", "name_review": "F.E.A.R.", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/13/fear", "text": "When I was growing up, horror came in the form of gory slasher movies and incredibly long Stephen King novels. Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Castle Rock ruled the roost. While King's stuff was sometimes really good, Hollywood didn't seem interested in anything more than upping the ante on gruesome special effects. In recent years, a movement has come over from Japan, as The Ring landed with a bang (although Sixth Sense did presage this movement by a couple years). The theme here is creeping out the viewer with unsettling, ambiguous imagery and paranormal phenomena. Recent entries such as The Grudge have shown that there might be only so much inspiration you can draw from this well, but Monolith decided to take the bull by the horns and produce a haunted, inspired world full of malevolent spirits and mysterious plots.    The First Encounter Assault Recon team is a military group that takes an aggressive attitude towards ghosts, and while the reasons never become very clear, it's a fairly good setup for a unique take on first-person shooters. You'll take the role of one of the soldiers, investigating what is at first simply the case of an escaped convict who has some unusual dietary tendencies. From there, the fit quickly hits the shan, and you'll find yourself knee-deep in a tragic, ghostly conspiracy. Sometimes it resembles Resident Evil, other times Fatal Frame. But FEAR stands on its own as a challenging and nuanced experience that I think is one of the best shooters this year.    The first thing you'll notice is how nice it looks. The proprietary engine is the product of years and years of development, and it's got more bells and whistles than a Rose Day Parade. The list of features is as long as my arm, and they're all fairly clearly explained in the options menus. You can tell the game to auto-detect the best settings, then run a brief benchmark to determine how well it's going to play. Or you can tweak dozens of different toggles and sliders to your heart's content. The review rig's auto-detect settings, with 3.0GHz P4, 1GB of RAM, and a GeForce 6800GT OC at 1024x768, had 4xAF (anisotropic filtering, to make textures look nicer), but no AA. (I was able to sneak 2xAA in, but I don't know if the game would perform well across the board with that).  Soft shadows were also off, but almost everything else was cranked to the max, and the benchmark ran at an average of 39 frames per second. For what it's worth, I used my home rig to play the game (which went gold about three weeks ago) at my place of residence, and I tested multiplayer on my game rig at work, which has similar specs but twice as much RAM.  Anyhoo, FEAR looks like it has indeed been optimized since the single-player demo was released. The physics aren't quite as detailed as what Half-Life 2 spoiled us with, but it's otherwise a top-of-the line game in terms of visuals. When re-loading a saved game or starting the game from the desktop, some initial physics quirks appeared sometimes. Bodies would twitch for a few moments, which is a little nerve-wracking with a title like this one. On one occasion, after having loaded the level, an enemy continued to fire his weapon after having fallen, and elsewhere a body kept slamming its arm into a trash can. (Speaking of load times, they were pretty reasonable on all our test rigs.)    On both occasions, however, I was able to silence them with a few bullets from my assault rifle. Random small objects tended to get bounced around a lot when I bumped into them, and switching to a weapon on the ground often made my character slam his current one to the floor. As far as general performance, there was some occasional hitching as various events were triggered. This may or may not be fixed by having a lot of RAM, an SATA hard drive, and/or a faster processor. It was never distracting. In fact, it allowed me to prepare somewhat for the salvo FEAR had in store for me.      And the gameplay isn't so bad either. As I noted in the impressions piece a couple days ago, the enemy's squad-based AI is pretty impressive. And they'll do a realistic amount of damage, so you'll want to make sure that your Reflex meter always has some juice in it. Like Bullet Time, Reflex puts you in Slo-Mo Mode, allowing you to move and shoot quickly for a limited amount of time, and it regenerates fairly quickly when not in use. If you poke around the nooks and crannies of each area, those hypodermic devices that permanently increase your pool of Reflex, and it will add up quite nicely, as will the permanent health boost hypos. Just be on the lookout for freakish ghost encounters. Not that there's anything I can really say that will prepare you for those jolts. Like I said before, watch those corners, because sometimes they're watching you.  At any rate, the enemies are very mobile and  aware of their environment and chances against you. As you pick them off one by one, they'll request backup, caustically refuse orders from their superiors to move in, flank you, toss grenades in your face, take pot shots, lean around obstacles, swear, wonder aloud where you are, make fearful pronouncements about your combat prowess, and notice your flashlight beam, among other details.  They're always on the lookout for you, react quickly, and are fine with hiding behind a corner to ambush you, rather than running at you blindly. If it wasn't for Slo-Mo, I would have been toast more times than I can count. And it's not just the brutal foot soldiers. You'll meet several varieties of enemy, each requiring specific tactics and weapon types.    Thankfully, you'll have three weapon slots, three grenade types, combat armor, and up to ten health packs that cure 50 points of health instantly. The shotgun and assault rifle are an easy choice for their adaptability, but you'll encounter some exotic weapons that might have you agonizing over whether you should switch from one to another, or keep on trucking with what you've got. Word of advice: stick with whatever does the most damage, and keep in mind that the more specialized weapons won't typically have a lot of ammo lying around. The Particle Weapon is a great railgun/sniper rifle, though, effective against both small and large, armored targets; the ASP rifle shoots three-round bursts and has a sniper scope, but it appears pretty rarely; the rocket launcher is even more exotic but is devastating against clumps of soldiers and heavies. I typically went with the Particle Weapon because you can get get one-shot kills from an impressive distance, and it fries the flesh off their bones, which is fun. For all weapons, reloading is very quick, and you don't lose rounds or shells when you want to discard a magazine and load a fresh one.    I think my favorite is the semi-automatic combat shotgun, which is deadly at close range and never seems to run low on ammo, even though I used it a ton. It's also the most entertaining weapon, in my opinion, since it can blow people to smithereens, with flying chunks and a vapor of blood. Yeah, this game gets juicy. It definitely ain't for the kids, and it's also peppered with R-rated profanity, but no sexual themes. Rooms will be full of blood and guts, some of which you're responsible for, and bodily juices go flying like they were running out of style.      But underneath the gore is a big creep-out factor. Voices in your head, startling hallucinations (or are they?), spooky visitations, things going bump in the dark. There are a few cheap jolts, but the scare factor comes mostly in the form of unusual noises, moving objects, moody lighting, and foreboding cinematic music. To say that FEAR keeps the tension running high is an understatement -- playing the game for a few hours straight can get a little draining, because the environment has been so well-crafted to keep you edgy and watchful. I found myself unconsciously leaning in towards the monitor, then realized I was setting myself up for some heart-skipping moments. The game draws you in, making you trepidacious yet incurably curious about every room you enter. Ghostly encounters are almost always spine-tingling and sometimes malevolent and gory. And other times you'll be moving slowly down an innocuous hallway, and next thing you know... you're not in that hallway anymore. Mysteries abound.    And they remain when the dust settles. Not all of the open questions look they were intended to stay that way, though. There is the question of where the enemy came from and how it's funded. There's the question of why certain people came to be the way they were in the first place. Maybe that will be explored in a sequel. I hope so.  I also hope that Monolith chooses a little more environmental variety. As you can probably tell from previous coverage, there's a lot of industrial complexes, and the tone stays urban the whole way through. As I wound my way towards the end of the game, I found myself thinking of the cool alternatives they could have thrown our way, like a derelict freighter, a lonely wilderness, a dank cave, a ghostly plane of existence, ancient ruins, an old castle, an abandoned desert town. I can appreciate the increased design work that goes into crafting good-looking areas in conventional locations these days, but I felt strong echoes of Max Payne, on top of the Slo-Mo Mode. On the other hand, this is about the strongest complaint I can level against the game.  Others might find FEAR to be a relatively short experience. I finished it in about twelve hours. It's not as short as Max Payne 2, but like that game, it's packed to the gills with action and suspense. It's not something you're going to want to rush through anyway, because the enemy will tear you a new one if you attempt to land in the middle of them guns blazing, even with Reflex activated. And there are are the heavy units that can take a wallop and dish one out too. You'll always be outnumbered and often outgunned. Thankfully, the environments are somewhat open. Although this does sometimes you to flanking, there is the occasional duct that will allow you to come in from behind (if you're willing to bear the darkness and a potentially heart-stopping encounter). You can also set proximity mines and grenades to protect certain routes. Unless the enemy doesn't use the floor, that is.    I, for one, am glad that the horror aspect wasn't just some cheap draw for a generic shooter. It's a well-integrated layer to a fun and challenging experience. And the spookiness is mature and thought-provoking, rather than being juvenile and cartoonish. Overall, the game seems to blend the most effective aspects of Resident Evil, Max Payne and Japanese horror, but it still stands on its own as something unique. Maybe it's because of the mysteries that are actually left to the player's imagination; maybe it's those creepy, poorly lit corridors; maybe it's the wanton gruesomeness and sometimes bizarre violence. The ambient music, odd sounds, and general sound palette are also really good. Combat is great because of this, with different impact sounds, breaking glass, people shouting, and a layer of distortion effects caused by going in and out of Slo-Mo.      Sometimes the music is almost tribal, for when you're about to encounter the enemy. Other times it crawls up the back of your spine with dissonant voices and low, foreboding notes. The story isn't stunningly original or especially moving, but its delivery comes wrapped in an awesome package full of details you pick up by checking voice mail messages in an office, poking through laptop computers, listening to radio newscasts, and having certain encounters that you'll just have to see for yourself. It still doesn't make a lot of sense that I'm able to seemingly access anyone's voice mail without a password, but then again, this guy does work for the government.  While multiplayer was not the focus of the game, it doesn't feel tacked on. You have the basic modes of Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag, and there are several fairly large maps to choose from. Interestingly, they managed to implement the Slo-Mo feature, and it works like this. Slo-Mo is a hypo power-up that only one person can pick up and carry at a time. To make matters more exciting, there's a navigation arrow on the screen that shows you where it is at all times. This way, the deathmatch modes can still have an objective, that of obtaining and maintaining possession of the item. When you pick it up, the meter starts filling it up, and you can't activate it until it's all juiced up. When you trigger it, it will drain all the way down, but everyone one the team shares the benefit, while the enemy is suddenly moving through molasses.  The assault rifle is particularly powerful in MP, followed closely by the ASP Rifle, then the shotgun. As in single-player, each weapon can be carefully aimed at the cost of movement speed, with some potentially devastating results, particularly when you factor in instant-kill headshots. Overall, I had a good deal of fun with multiplayer -- more than I'd expected. It's a fine companion to the excellent single-player portion. There aren't enough maps to really extend the life of the game, but it's a solid landing point when you've finished the main game.   As I mentioned in the impressions piece, I was worried about FEAR, because Monolith and gang had been so tight-lipped and mysterious, which I've learned isn't always a good thing. I expect certain other developers and publishers to be reticent, but Monolith is usually happy to talk about their latest project. After playing the game, I understand the air of mystery, because there's plenty of surprises to be had -- and questions they can't answer because the game leaves a few loose ends, mostly intentionally. I look forward to a sequel with derelict sea vessels and voice mail passwords. I don't need new, flashy weapons or new, flashy bad guys. That would be neat, but would be better would be to further explore this story that Monolith has done such a great job of setting up. I feel like I've been waiting since Half-Life 2 for a really good, story-based shooter, and that's a lot of competitors in between there and here, for a guy in my line of work. FEAR has that immediacy, and that ambition to suck the player in with vivid immediacy and top-of-the heap production values.And furthermore, in this age of sequelitis and franchise pimpery, it's great to see someone take the leap with an all-new property, and not in the form of a rip-off of something already established. Monolith forges new shooter territory with some truly freaky elements, challenge, fun, and beauty. If there is a fly in the ointment, it's that the environments aren't too varied, and the game is kinda short. And there are a few plot holes (where did this army come from?) and logic holes (how can I access all of this voice mail?). Otherwise, I was sucked in to the end.", "date": "Oct 13, 2005"}
