{"name": "Crusader Kings", "name_review": "Crusader Kings", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/24/crusader-kings", "text": "In the three-and-a-half years since the release of the original Europa Universalis, Paradox Entertainment has released several sequels each expanding the empire management mechanic into new areas. But though the developers have adapted the game to suit a diverse range of periods, they've done very little to change the basic point of the game or to make it approachable for all but the most passionate fans of strategy and historical detail. While Crusader Kings does add an entirely new mechanic to the game with the concept of family management, it fails to smooth out the series' complexity or improve its stability.  Crusader Kings is set in medieval Europe and features a cast of thousands of nobles, from petty counts of minor provinces to kings of entire realms. The three campaigns allow you to start your game during the invasion of 1066, the Third Crusade or the Hundred Year's War. As an added bonus, you can import your games into Europa Universalis and continue building your dynasty for another couple hundred years.  In most large-scale strategy games, Civilization for instance, you adopt the role of an abstract ruler who sets the policies for their nation throughout the course of the game. While Crusader Kings still allows you to run events from start to finish, you'll do so through the members of a growing and expanding family. In many ways this is just as important as the management of your empire. Each of the members of your family have varying abilities in the areas of tactical leadership, political administration and negotiation.   Setting the right people up as your advisors and as vassals of your smaller kingdoms is key here. You'll need to watch out though as these family members develop their own ideas as to what's in their best interest and it's not unusual for you to have to keep the more ambitious members from taking power away from the person you're controlling.  Family members grow in a variety of ways as well. Though you'll send each through school with an eye towards developing a specific focus, in-game events can have a profound effect on their personality and usefulness to the family. Chaste characters have fewer children but higher piety than Lusty characters for instance. Characters who become Wise will have higher ratings in all management areas but will find themselves disliked by most all other family members.  Managing your family is a definite plus for the series since it provides an interesting set of short range goals for the player. Unlike Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings has no set objectives. While the open-ended sandbox mode allows for players to find their own priorities in the game, there's perhaps too much freedom here. A ranking system lets you see your status relative to other rulers but the game would have benefited from the inclusion of goals to act as milestones throughout the game.  After seven iterations and much complaining on the part of reviewers and gamers, we'd expect that the developers would have reduced the overall complexity of the series. It's not that the game needs to be dumbed down at all; the wealth of details is in fact one of the series' key strengths. What's missing here is a thorough explanation of how the game works.  Declaring war is an excellent example of how the developers emphasize complexity. Before you can even start a war, you have to have a cause. You can simply grab the titles of nearby provinces but you'll need some justification for your claim and even then you'll take a prestige hit. It's much simpler just to seek out your religious enemies with whom you have an automatic right to open hostilities. After mobilizing your armies, you'll simply march them into enemy provinces where the game takes charge of combat for you. You can influence the outcome through the policies you've set throughout the game but at this point victory or defeat is completely out of your hands.      The manual talks about the importance of developing balanced forces but a long term reform of your army involves many years of management adjustments. This can actually be one of your main concentrations in the game. Each province contains peasants, merchants, clergy and nobles and every policy you set seems to increase the power of one group at the expense of another. Since these groups are the ones who provide your military might, knowing which ones to strengthen and which ones to weaken is key to success.   The manual could do a much better job of explaining this and other features of the game and the complete lack of a tutorial makes for a learning curve so steep that most casual gamers will give up before they discover the excitement lurking beneath the details here. The pop-up windows in the game help to orient you somewhat and have thankfully been reduced to provide only the essential information. I would have preferred a bit more help in some areas. When you receive a marriage proposal, for instance, it might be useful to also be told what types of inheritance laws the offering country follows.  As with previous games, the AI seems unable to stop the big stack players from throwing all their troops together and burning a wide swath through their enemies. This is what we in America call ~pulling a Sherman.~  As long as you've got a reasonable base of six provinces or more, you can levy an army sizable enough to take out almost any of your neighbors. Multiplayer provides more of a challenge, provided you can manage to connect to the Valkyrie service. Players on dial-up seem to be completely out of luck in this regard.   Graphically the game hasn't developed much since the first Europa Universalis. The map is still pleasant enough to look at, I suppose, but it's about time it was updated. The team has also neglected to improve the army and ship sprites. The upside to this is that the game still runs on lower end systems but I'm still convinced that more could be done to make the visual presentation prettier and more functional.  Though it might not be everyone's cup of tea, the music is very well done and suits the mood of the game well. Beyond the music, there aren't too many sound effects to speak of. Some small ambient sounds add a bit of life to particular menu options but, beyond that, you might as well just turn the sound completely off and have an MP3 player running in the background.  Unfortunately, the game is still buggy even after the release of the 1.3 patch. Previous games in the series suffered from similar crash problems at the time of their release and most have been substantially improved over time. We're hopeful that Crusader Kings will enjoy similar improvements in the coming months but, until then the principal suggestion is to save early and save often. Though Europa Universalis has had more sequels over the last few years than just about any other title, Crusader Kings is one of the best. Europa Universalis II still stands out above the others but Crusader Kings manages to at least offer something substantially new that the other games haven't. The family mechanic definitely adds a lot of much-needed personality to the series.The problem is that there are still too many obstacles in the way of actually enjoying the game. Europa veterans will be able to get the hang of this one fairly quickly but the learning curve is definitely steep for new players. Though a tutorial couldn't hope to cover every aspect of the game, one should definitely have been included to at least introduce the more important mechanics.I think it's clear at this point that Paradox gets this message as they've promised to spend much more effort in this area with their upcoming sequel to Hearts of Iron. It's just too bad that Crusader Kings couldn't have enjoyed the same consideration.", "date": "Sep 24, 2004"}
