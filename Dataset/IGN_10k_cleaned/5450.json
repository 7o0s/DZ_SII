{"name": "Trivial Pursuit [2005]", "name_review": "Trivial Pursuit", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/01/29/trivial-pursuit", "text": "Trivial Pursuit was one of the biggest brands in board games in the 1980s, making it just as much of a cultural icon as the Rubik's Cube. Adults would crowd around a table to answer incredibly diverse questions in categories like ~Entertainment~ and ~History,~ then chuckle with their spouse on the way home about the couple with the fewest pie pieces.   ~Ho ho -- Bob and Judy didn't know who was convicted of kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. Morons. Don't let out daughter play with their kids any more.~   Well, now the great contest of cerebral storage capacities has come to handsets, courtesy of Starwave. The go-go edition is actually a very tight facsimile of the board game. It shaves a couple corners by offering multiple choice answers instead of letting you type in guess -- but that is a very blessed change considering the format. But everything else, from rolling the dice to moving around a cleanly presented board in search of pie pieces (you earned one when you answered a question correctly on that category's headquarters space), is included.   But in addition to the classic play modes, Trivial Pursuit also offers several additional challenges of varying satisfaction. Our favorite was the High Stakes Mode where you could bet bonus points while answering questions. Nail three correctly and you earn not only that pie piece, but also double bonus points. And it seemed to us that when we went for the wedge, we got handed a doozy. Category Challenge is also fun, as it lets you concentrate on one specific line of trivia.   There are hundreds upon hundreds of questions in Trivial Pursuit, which means you should be able to play a good number of games without repeats. If you want to really extend the game's life, you can opt to not have the correct answer revealed after a botched question. The questions are all over the map in difficulty, from some real softballs to some that had us hitting Google out of frustration. (What? We wanted to see what happened when you actually beat the game.)   Trivial Pursuit has a pass-the-phone multiplayer option that is cool, but it would be nice if you could wade online and challenge a sea of smartypants. Perhaps the next version, Starwave?I have always been a fan of this board game, so not only does that make me something of a mark for the license, it also means I'm not willing to accept a bad representation of it, either. I didn't have any problem with the switch to multiple choice answers, because typing in ~Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town~ is a major pain. Maybe if I was playing on a Sidekick or something with QWERTY. This is a great to-go portion of the classic board game, and if you are any fan of the game, Trivial Pursuit is a very good value for your download dollars.", "date": "Jan 29, 2005"}
