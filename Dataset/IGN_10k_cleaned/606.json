I grew up on all the old videogames, from the arcade to the Atari...even the Commodore 64 and Apple II, and the Game Boy Color is a perfect venue for bringing back the great classics. Developers can't depend on any 3D hardware to ~update~ the gameplay, so it's appropriate to just offer what the game was. Wings of Fury originated on the Apple II more than a decade ago  it was easily one of my favorites on that computer. The Game Boy rendition is almost a spot-on recreation (and in some cases, it's even more so), but it's missing a couple key elements that would make this game a direct hit. Features Fifteen missions Four types of weaponry Two viewpoints For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   Wings of Fury is a combat shooter where you take control of an F6F Hellcat caught in the middle of the war in the Pacific. Your task is to complete 15 missions of taking control of the Pacific waters by claiming back the islands controlled by the Japanese. Launch off your carrier and take out the bunkers, guns, and enemy planes and carriers with your arsenal of bombs, rockets, torpedoes, and your trusty machine gun. The game takes place in a side-scrolling perspective, making this game more of an action game than a simulation.  The Game Boy version of the game is essentially what the Apple II game was -- a really cool shooter with minor simulation aspects. The game keeps close when your plane zooms over the surface, and pulls back to give you a full-sky view when you head higher into the air. The portable game adds a few new gameplay features  most specifically tweaking the controls to give the plane a bit more maneuverability. You can now pull off S-turns and barrel rolls where you couldn't in the original game. What's more, landing the plane and refueling on the Game Boy version is a lot easier and friendlier than it was on the computer.   But there are some omissions to note, items that were in the Apple II design but didn't make the cut here. Bullets from your machine guns don't spit the land or water up into the air when you strafe the ground, so you can't really see where your bullets are landing when firing wildly (not to mention that it was a really cool effect). The enemy troops that scatter after destroying a bunker have been replaced with a single Jeep vehicle cruising the island  it was great fun swooping down low to mow down the panicking troops with your guns in the original, an element sorely missing in the Game Boy version. Most importantly, though, is the fact that when you run out of fuel or take one too many shots (or you just fly incompetently), your plane explodes on contact with the ground or water. In the original computer version, your plane would skid across the surface, taking out whatever target ended up below the belly of your vehicle. Not only was it a cool, dramatic effect, it also gave you a last ditch attempt to take out the little victims below.  Despite the small changes in the game, Wings of Fury is still a heck of a lot of fun. The missions are long and challenging, especially when you have to take out multiple islands and carriers  flying back and forth to refuel, repair, and rearm. Dog fights are pretty basic because of the sidescrolling perspective, but they still require a bit of strategy to outwit your opponent into flying ahead of you.   If I never, ever played Wings of Fury on the Apple II, I'd probably be raving about the game (in fact, I still am, just not as much as I would have). It's still a well-designed action game, even for a game designed more than a decade ago. It may sound like I'm nitpicking with the small omissions, but I have to say  I really miss the surge of adrenaline when I swooped down with guns blazing, picking off the enemy troops before they got to repair the ground-to-air guns, or slammed into the ground, skidded to a stop to plow into an enemy bunker. It's the little things that mean a lot. Still, the game is one that I highly recommend picking up, especially if you're unfamiliar with the original design. It's like nothing else on the Game Boy.", "date": "Jan 7, 2000"}
