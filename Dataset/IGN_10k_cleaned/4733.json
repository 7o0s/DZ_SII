Super Puzzle Fighter Fighter Turbo is still, bar none, a great game, but at its core its a variation on Tetris. Devil Dice is smart and addicting the way Tetris is, it requires a tremendous level of skill, and it's based on the concept of dice.  The game pits you against real or computer foes in a spare environment containing an army of dice and one 3D platform. The object of the game is to tumble dice in limited moves to match up numerically with other dice and beat either a clock or an opponent. For instance, in Puzzle mode, you need to bring one die next to the other and match the two top numbers to make them disappear. So, economy is crucial because your steps are limited, and memorization is required because you absolutely need to know on which side the number three is opposite, for example. THQ imported and made American this Sony Music Entertainment title quite popular in Japan, adding very little to it. That's a plus, too. It was good then, and now it's simply English. Devil Dice packs four modes of play into a no frills graphic package -- Trial (you against an unlimited amount of dice), Battle (you against a computer player), Wars (multiplayer versus either one to five people or the computer AI), and Puzzle (limited step puzzles). Visually, however, not much is needed to make this game great, a standout in the day and age of the 3D-requiem of graphic tarts and special effects. There is you little cute little devil fella and the dice. Simple, right?   Musically, the game is nearly brilliant. Devil Dice mixes an amazing amount of electronica with all sorts of genres, including ragtime jazz, reggae, and rock, and all of it is simple, but groovy in the way that Trio (Da Da Da) captured our ears many years ago.  The game plays in both multiplayer or single player modes, and does not support analog or dual shock features.I absolutely love this game and play it incessantly. It's so well thought out it makes most other games look bloated, overdone, and excessive. Devil Dice has that sleek, economical intelligence that really makes you dig into it. And shortly after picking it up, you'll be hooked for good.Though it's short on graphics, it would be almost redundant to have any more. In fact, this game could be in vector graphics and still be brilliant. But Devil Dice is about outpuzzling the opponent, not visuals. What I really liked is that each mode is different enough from one another, but yet is still based on the same core rules. Additionally, the game's multiplayer feature blows any other puzzler -- or for that matter any other multiplayer game -- away. It absolutely rocks. My only warning is that some people simply won't get it. I've talk to a few people who just didn't like it. So, I would recommend that those folks who are curious and aren't wild puzzle gamers, might want to rent it first. Then again, several of women in our office were immediately addicted, so it's particularly great for the female persuasion. I honestly think most people will skip over this title come buying time because of its strange concept and simple graphics, despite it's amazing gameplay. It'll probably live on as the great sleeper of our time, though I hope it sells well.I would easily place this in the highest ranks of puzzlers on any system.", "date": "Sep 30, 1998"}
