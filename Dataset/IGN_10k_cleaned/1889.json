I will of course say much more, but it is still true that this is a hard game to describe in relation to any other game (save Metal Gear, and even that's more a consequence of the original's timing rather than than an honest kinship).  Winback's particular take on 3D action, first seen when the game hit the Nintendo 64 a couple of years ago, has still never been copied, or even very closely resembled.  Its nearest cousin would be Syphon Filter, perhaps, but even that's not very close -- Winback is much slower, more measured, and with a much different camera perspective.  It's certainly not perfect, and those qualities that set it apart will no doubt turn off players unwilling to adjust the reflexes they've learned from Resident Evil, Syphon Filter or Metal Gear.  But I did enjoy Winback, and among the many gamers who missed in on the N64, there certainly should be some who'll enjoy its original twist on the genre.  Gameplay  Winback is frequently criticized as a poor man's Metal Gear, but that's missing the point -- while they're both a blend of stealth and action, what comes out of the Cuisinart is something very different in this case.  Winback's perspective is fixed behind your commando's back (his name is Jean-Luc, incidentally, for reasons shrouded in mystery) and at a very low angle, with the default camera facing on almost the same plane as his eyes.  It doesn't have to stay that way, though, being fully rotatable, and then there's the wall-flatten maneuver, which changes everything.  This is the central element of Winback.  In one of those interesting bits of irony, something Omega Force borrowed from the original Metal Gear Solid seems to have been borrowed right back for MGS2.  Flattening yourself against a wall, of course, is one of the most common maneuvers in Metal Gear.  The original Winback took that and added the ability to quickly hop out from around a corner from that position into a firing stance, so you could jump out, squeeze off a few shots, and duck back behind cover -- which, of course, you can now do in Metal Gear Solid 2.  A nice compliment, if a backhanded one.  Anyway, you'll spend at least a sizable fraction of this game hidden around a corner from the bad guys, much more so than in Metal Gear.  Winback progresses at a slower, more strategic pace through comparatively linear areas -- you're not always trotting straight from point A to point B, but your objective is usually clear and the path laid out relatively plainly.  The enemy encounters are pre-set, so you meet the same opposition in the same spots each time through, but there's actually a touch of relatively smart AI here and there governing their reactions in combat.  Wound an enemy and he'll run for cover rather than slugging it out toe to toe, and many guards are smart enough to keep their heads down behind cover or dive for a prone shooting position.  The basic gameplay sometimes works at cross-purposes with the level design, which leads to some pretty cheap deaths now and again -- if you're not careful where you step and where you look with the camera, it's entirely possible to get shot from off-screen or from angles where you never expected an enemy to be.  This, you may recall, is one of the things that bothered me about Fear Effect 2, and it certainly bothers me here.  Winback at least offers you control over the camera, which means you can avoid most threats if you're patient enough, but I would have liked that camera control to be a little more responsive.  The shoulder-button rotation sometimes has a bit of a delay before it kicks in, and the analog rotation could have been a little faster.  Given that the auto-aim is pretty friendly, I would have liked a quicker rotation through set chunks of arc like you see in Mario 64 or Burning Rangers.  Once you get the hang of the unusual controls, which doesn't take terribly long, there's actually a lot of fun to be found in Winback's multiplayer modes, especially when you unlock all the bosses and their goofy special weapons (miniguns, RPG launchers, all that fun stuff).  There's four-player support and plenty of games to play, from straight deathmatch through several tag and capture-the-widget variations.  The unusual controls mean this isn't as accessible a party game as something like Timesplitters would be -- most anybody can handle a basic FPS right off, while Winback has more of a learning curve -- but a few players who know the game could have a lot of fun slugging it out with the selection of weapons.  Graphics  The N64 veterans walking past my desk had plenty of unkind comments about Winback's looks, but it actually is a marked improvement on the original version.  While the lighting effects haven't received a marked amount of tuning (the unlit flashlight areas are okay, and some of the explosions are neat, but it's not the difference we saw in DOA2), the character models are beefed up with many more polygons, and the texture detail is much-improved, especially when you see the characters' clothes and faces up close.  There's also better fog effects for things like exploding boxes and bullet hits.  Of course, it's a little hard to appreciate the model refinement when you're busting a gut over the dialogue in the cinemas, but more on that later...  Animation is the principal failing of Winback's graphics, aside from the fact that the overall design hasn't radically changed from the rather bland N64 original.  Everyone moves more or less alright from the waist up, and the lip-synching is good enough, but Gabe Logan finally has someone to make his mutant gait look normal.  Jean-Luc walks with his torso purposefully thrust forward about 30 degrees and held stiff as a board, while his legs pace off short steps underneath and his arms pump in short little arcs.  You have to see it to appreciate how silly it is.  For further amusement, let Jean idle a bit and watch his head rotate endlessly in an orderly visual search pattern.    I do like the reloading and firing animations, though, always a plus in an action game, and that dreaded Nintendo fog has burned off almost completely.  Winback's draw distance is now about as far off as you would require, with very little pop-in or fogging at the draw horizon.  Sound  The soundtrack here definitely taps some underused genres -- it stays very quiet most of the time, with just a light beat here and there, but when the tunes crank up you can hear some very Fifth Element-ish Mediterranean rhythms, which makes for a pleasant change of pace from what you usually get in games like this (generic rock, generic techno, or generic I-sure-wish-I-were-Hans-Zimmer).  I could have done with meatier sound effects, though, like an honest Carmackian BOOM! for the shotgun rather than the wimpy chu-gunk sound that accompanies it instead.  Sure, it drops armored thugs with one shot, but it doesn't feel like it would.  The voice acting, meanwhile, is some pretty raw cheese, although the story and characters are silly enough that I don't particularly care (and according to some folks I've talked to who were involved in the localization, it could have actually been much, much worse).  In a game carried by action, the cinematics are merely frosting -- if the cake's good enough, I'll eat it anyway. And this is a pretty good cake, albeit of a flavor you've probably never tried.  Metal Gear Solid 2 is a leap ahead and then some, don't get me wrong, but on the PS2's 3D action ladder I'd put Winback ahead of X-Squad, on the strength of its better-thought-out gameplay and far longer mission (not to mention the replay value all the multiplayer modes add).  The additions probably aren't enough to draw in players of the N64 version, but PS2 gamers who could use something to tide them over may want to give Jean-Luc's mission a shot.", "date": "Apr 6, 2001"}
