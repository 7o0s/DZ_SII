The thrill of the G-force, aggressive opponents, and fantastic cars are always a brilliant draw, and TOCA Championship Racing has them all.  Using the real cars, teams, and courses from the official TOCA (Touring Car) races, Codemasters has realized a complete and well-rounded game filled with all of the right touches and details. Broken up into four modes, racers can get to grips with a quick race (Single Race), or contend for the full glory of the championship in Championship mode. In this full season mode, players will duel against 15 opponents in 24 rounds (or races) at nine venues for the highest accumulation of points. For speed demons, a Time Trial mode is available for a more pure race against time. And last but not least is the two-player mode that enables gamers to play with the elegant option of vertical or horizontal split screens.  Packed with a series of excellent elements, TOCA works to bring you into the game with realism. Decent pit lanes, four viewpoints, and a choice of weather (sunny, cloudy, fog, storm, rain, snow) are available before or during play.  While the tracks themselves aren't the most outrageous ones we've seen, they're all based on the real English courses used by the TOCA governing body. All of the real tracks are here, including Donington Park Grand Prix, Silverstone International, Thruxton, Brands Hatch Indy, Oulton Park Fosters, Donington Park Short, Croft, Knockhill, and Snetterton.  Graphically, TOCA does the job efficiently. Little to no pop-in can be seen (although it does exist), the cars are well-designed and finely crafted, and almost no slowdown can be found in the midst of a pack. As we said earlier, TOCA pays attention to the details. The shift in track environments alters your control substantially. For example, hit a sand pit and slow down to a slug's crawl; drive into gravel and you'll lose your grip, or run into a grassy field and you'll spin out like a top. In this game it pays to stay on course.  Despite TOCA's detail-oriented driving, it doesn't stun visually. Backgrounds are sparse and a first overall impression of the game provides a rough, unpolished feel. TOCA uses a relatively low resolution that highlights painful jaggies and a low polygon count for everything but the cars.   However, the viewpoints reveal more than just a different perspective. With a standard four perspectives (behind far, behind close, driver's seat, and cockroach cam), TOCA shows you a great cockpit view complete with the driver shifting gears at just the right moments.  TOCA also includes bonuses such as extra tracks, bonus cars, and new driving modes, once you've opened them up. Hint: Beat the Championship mode for starters. Make sure to enable both the analog and dual shock vibration for a full arcade experience.Despite its outdated look, TOCA is an excellent game. A title, in fact, with which we have few qualms. I slipped right into the groove in the first race and took to its realistic courses and excellent AI at once. The AI is just short of awesome. Cars speed up from behind and nudge you into the grass. Opponents will knock you into the pack or throw you off the track around turns, and it appears they're just mean spirited when actually they're just smart AI drivers. What's even better is that the AI is firing up in all of the difficulty levels, even in easy mode. The physics systems are right on target. You swerve and turn with amazing realism. Funnily enough, from behind the cars looking more like hovercrafts. Thankfully they don't move like them. Another excellent aspect is the damage cars take when colliding with others. Polygons will fly when you smash against another car. Hoods bend inward, windows crack and explode: It's a hell of a lot of fun.Still, A few aspects are missing that could've made the game a tad more complete. Nowhere can an on-screen map be found. This missing could assist in strategy and make the difference between second and third place. A rear-view mirror can be assigned beforehand in the in-car perspectives, but still no map. Damn. In another area that's lacking, the music is nothing to talk about -- generic, forgettable techno. It's better to simply turn the music off entirely. The music is completely forgettable.Overall, I found this more fun than even Sega's relatively old Touring Car arcade conversion, which was a beautiful looking game, but not terribly memorable. TOCA takes the cake in gameplay.", "date": "Jan 20, 1999"}
