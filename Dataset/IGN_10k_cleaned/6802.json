Back when the firm was Atlas Mobile, they devised a very smart system to get players hooked to their games -- offer them free stuff. Skee-Ball for Prizes follows the same formula. Players practice for as long as they want, and then sign up for head-to-head matches and progressive tournaments in hopes of coming out on top -- and receiving a nice gift certificate in the mail.   Honestly, I was on the verge of giving Skee-Ball a resounding ~meh.~ But, by some measure of fortune, I visited a Wunderland last weekend with my youngest nephew which happened to have a shallow row of skee ball machines, something I hadn't seen in years. After playing the real thing, I developed a different level of appreciation for Infospace's effort. The mechanics of not using a traditional meter, but the constant sway of the ball pre-throw, is a pretty solid recreation of the physical activity. Using bank shots to hit the high-value holes in the corners -- also very accurate.   Skee-Ball offers more than just basic play. There is a series of mini-challenges with original goals, such as trying to plant a ball in each pocket on a 4x5 grid. You get no points for repeating the same hole. To unlock new levels, you have to earn tickets. Every 50 points equals 1 ticket. I wish more of these challenges were open from the get-go, because while I think console and PC gamers have the mindset to earn new content, mobile gamers deserve everything up front.   Skee-Ball looks quite good. The 3D effect for the boards is well implemented, the game starts with a nice little jingle, and there are sound effects strewn throughout the entire game.  Skee-Ball for Prizes is a pretty solid little game -- a good entry for Infospace's For Prizes franchise. I think it replicates actual skee-ball fairly well, as long as you have your expectations in order. If you like skill-based casual play instead of puzzlers and are looking for another For Prizes title to add to your library (you have a library of them, don't you?), Skee-Ball is a nice download.", "date": "Apr 4, 2006"}
