The purple fella was freed of PlayStation exclusivity, landing on systems as far flung as the Xbox and Nintendo DS. Spyro is also no stranger to mobile, either. This prequel ditches the isometric camera of the previous mobile game in favor of a much more gamer-friendly side-scrolling experience.   A New Beginning, developed for mobile by Mighty Troglodytes and published by Vivendi Games Mobile, is a four world adventure that tracks Spyro from his humble beginning as the friend of Sparx the Dragonfly that would later become a trusted ally. Charged with defeating an evil warlord named Cynder (most names in Spyro are related to fire), Spyro must learn his trademark fire breathing and flying skills before going into battle.   It doesn't take too long before you're given the talents of head-bashing and burn breath, which is merciful, because the stages are soon packed with monsters that mean harm to this cute little dragon. You can use 7 or 9 to head-butt enemies (it usually takes more than one lunge) or press 5 to shower them with fire balls. Fire balls have a fairly limited range, so I found myself using the charge move more often as I ran through the platforming levels.   Each world is composed over a handful of stages. One always involves flying through a cave of sorts, which is always scrolling by. If you get caught on a ledge due to indecision, Spyro takes damage. Flying requires the constant use of magic, so you must seek out green gems to keep your mojo working. Red gems replenish health, so if you've taken a beating, be sure to seek out these bonuses, too. The flying levels have several puzzles in them that require return trips when you learn the technique of elemental fire. With different breath, Spyro can hit switches and drop gates to reveal valuable gems.   Honestly, I didn't really care for the flying levels. The platforming stages are far better, as you navigate through winding caves that stretch both vertically and horizontally. You must use Spyro's glide (mapped to 1and 3) to soar over extended gaps in the ground. These stages are also loaded with gems. The monsters, which I thought looked really smart are large, thus posing a real challenge. You cannot just avoid trouble. Spyro has to mix it up.   As expected from any self-respecting platformer, Spyro must contend with boss monsters at the end of each world. These are typically almost as large as the screen. Each has a pattern to be memorized so you can bash or burn at just the right moment. Boss design is also quite good. The artists on this game obviously took pride in their work.   Between stages, you move Spyro around a world map. This lets you easily re-play stages after learning new powers.  As a mobile platformer, this Spyro is strong. My top recommendation is still Sonic the Hedgehog, but A New Beginning is a real contender. The excellent boss battles are the highlight of the game andhelp make up for the iffy flying stages. A New Beginning isn't the toughest challenge on mobile -- I think most players will burn through it in just a couple hours. If you are still fan of the character and aren't some horrible console snob that can't have fun without a seventeen-button controller or 46~ plasma, A New Beginning is a fine way to reconnect with an old purple friend.", "date": "Feb 23, 2007"}
