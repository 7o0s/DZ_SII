Though it's by no means a bad game, this quaint and quirky platformer doesn't really display what the Neo Geo could do. It looks more like a title that you'd find running on the Game Boy Advance, and it's hard to recommend investing in a game like that.   The portable comparison might be apt, as well, considering Blue's theme and environment. He's a miniature hero living in an oversized world, a guy who looks like a human being but dresses himself like a bug. The story finds that it's up to little boy Blue to save his fellow insect-costumed compatriots from the imminent encroachment of pollution, and he's equipped for the job with the powers of nature.   Blue gets it done by dumping leaves. That's right. Meaning, leaves. Simple green tree leaves function as your primary attack while controlling Blue, and any enemies hit by the leaves are forcibly flipped upside-down. Then, running to touch them, you can pick them up as in Super Mario Bros. 2, and use them as projectiles to assault other foes.   It's a fine mechanic that works fairly well, though the range of your initial ~leaf dump~ (as it's called) is a bit lacking, and dealing with multiple incoming adversaries at once can be troublesome. And because Blue's was designed with the arcade in mind, as with other Neo-Geo games, you'll find that troublesome situations often lead to quick and unfortunate death. Blue can only take two hits initially before it's time to re-spawn, though you can upgrade his abilities through items purchased at shops.   Leaves and leaping isn't all there is to see, as Blue can also shrink himself to fit into small places, duck into mid-stage rest stops like the homes of non-player characters and choose multiple paths to take to advance through the adventure, but overall it plays out how you'd expect it to. There's a two-player co-op mode that lets a second player jump in as Blue's green-colored friend, which is a nice addition, but is it enough to make Blue's Journey worth its total asking price? Not really.If you want platformers, even co-op ones, there are plenty of other, cheaper (and better) options out there -- Contra and Gunstar Heroes to name a few. If you're in search of games with cute, colorful graphics, there are plenty of those to be had too. Heck, even if you want a game where the hero dresses up like an insect, Mario and his bumblebee suit say hello! In other words, there's little reason to get excited about the content here. For diehard genre fans only, I'd say,", "date": "Nov 21, 2007"}
