One of the first sequels of 2000 for the NeoGeo Pocket Color is Puzzle Link 2, the next in line to the original game that we loved last year. But how much has really changed that will make owners of the first pick up the second? Not much  but it's still a must have game for those who haven't been introduced to the original. Features: Card, Marathon, and Puzzle Modes Card Game Link cable support for two players For NeoGeo Pocket Color   Even though it's a true sequel (released a mere six months after the first one), the gameplay of the main puzzle hasn't changed a bit. Here's the deal: you face a bin of colored shapes that hover above your ~pod.~ You can move your pod in nine different locations across the screen. The idea is simple: link two or more like colors together to eliminate that grouping. How? By throwing connectors up at the pile. When you want to link, say, a yellow target, you hit the a button to put up a connector. Keep throwing connectors until you've linked one target with the other  if that target isn't part of the original grouping of yellow targets, the two groups will disappear. Once that happens, the pieces will settle up into the pile  if the pieces create new groupings of two or more of the same color, those will disappear as well.   Compared to the original version, there are a couple new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge levels and puzzle rounds, as well as the two player link-cable option. But new to the series is the Marathon-style game where you just keep eliminating pieces until it gets too fast to keep up. In this mode, the faster you play, the more often the power-up shows up. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. This makes it easy to work from scratch, since more often than not you're going to wipe out the entire screen from all the chain reactions, thanks to the power-up.   The big addition is the card game  in the original, you earned cards based on how fast you could clear out the levels, but these cards were nothing but trophies. In Puzzle Link 2, you still earn cards if you clear out a level before the set time, but if you earn enough cards you can head over to the Card Game to battle either another player or a computer opponent. The card game isn't much more than a game of War  at the beginning of your turn, you choose one of your cards, and the computer does the same. If your suit beats his suit, you earn points. If his card beats your card, he earns points.  The person to reach the point-spread wins one of the other person's cards...for keeps. The card game isn't exactly deep, but it's an addition to Puzzle Link that will keep you playing to earn all the cards, if nothing else to have something to brag about.  The only other new inclusion to the original game is the option to change the puzzle icons between three types. Obviously this isn't much to jump for joy over, but it's nice to have the option. Overall the game hasn't changed at all, it's just got a bunch more stuff. It's a little annoying to have purchased a great puzzle game, only to have it be improved (however slightly) six months later. Puzzle Link 2 is definitely not a huge step above the first one, and in fact it's really only a tiny baby step when you look at all the options they really give you. The main reason to get this game is to finally have a reason to collect all those cards, but the card game is so minor that it's definitely not going to be a selling point. But no matter how much I rag on the fact that the game hasn't improved much since the first game, it doesn't dismiss the fact that Puzzle Link is still an awesome and addicting puzzle game. It's one of the NeoGeo's best puzzlers, and if you haven't picked up the original I highly recommend Puzzle Link 2. But to buy this game if you own the original? Only if you've got money to burn.", "date": "Apr 27, 2000"}
