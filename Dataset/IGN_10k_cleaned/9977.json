Frequently decried for his tactics and his use of force, he's been depicted in artwork, literature and even videogames as a cruel villain and tyrant.  However, this is also the man that managed to unite a bitterly divided Feudal Japan with diplomacy, key battles and political manipulation, ushering in a period of peace.  Koei has frequently let players decide for themselves what kind of a man Oda was with their Nobunaga's Ambition strategy franchise.  After more than a decade's absence, North American tacticians will finally get their hands on the latest game in the series, Nobunaga's Ambition: Rise to Power.   Rise to Power is set in Feudal Japan during the 16th century within the Sengoku, or Warring States, period.  According to history, Nobunaga rose to power during this time, instituting various economic and political policies to stimulate and bolster the infrastructure of his fiefs.  At the same time, he was building and gathering together the most advanced military that Japan had ever seen, providing muscle to enact his laws and put down those that opposed his will.  Players have the option to become Nobunaga and  attempt to recreate his success in uniting the country or select a rival warlord and rewrite the history books.     One of the facets that makes Rise to Power very deep as a strategy game is the amount of variety that is available to players, primarily when it comes to choosing how and where they will start their attempted conquest of Japan.  Thanks to the large number of options available to players, you have hundreds of potential starting points, including four difficulty levels, different warlords to choose from, and other options.  For example, one of these options is the inclusion of fictional ~What if~ moments, such as possible marriages between clans or meetings between warriors that never existed affecting the alliances and political makeup of the map of Japan. While you aren't forced to include these moments in your gameplay, it doesn't wreck a scenario and can add a lot of depth to the historical presentation. Luckily, if you're confused by any option or command, you can refer to the gigantic in-game manual to help you during the game.   The game itself is split into two significant phases of play which governs just about everything you do: Strategy and Battle.  Strategy is the more significant of the two, because you'll carry out just about every decision that will affect your fiefdoms apart from invading or repelling enemies.  This includes the growth and development of each territory under your control, transporting goods and soldiers between your lands, negotiations with merchants or other warlords, and tactical sabotage of enemies or interaction with your officers.  For the most part, most of the micromanagement is handled for you, so farmers will harvest and collect crops during the right times, markets will conduct commerce and troops will be trained and inducted into your armies.  As a result, you'll be  provided with a limited amount of orders that you can give to your officers in each turn for each fief to strengthen your territory, such as creating new facilities within their borders, reducing riots and recruiting ronin to lead your forces into battle.   Good luck unifying Japan -- you'll need it. Unfortunately, your officers wind up becoming a larger problem when it comes to the development of your kingdoms than you'd expect.  See, the achievement of just about every single task that you give them is supposed to be governed by that officer's stats, such as politics or charm, that range from one to one hundred. Technically, you'd think that the higher a rating, the more successful or influential that officer would be at certain things, which would be why you'd use some characters for negotiations and others for espionage. However, the game will frequently disregard this logic, making highly rated officers fail at tasks and lesser, more inept leaders succeed.  Not only does this make little to no sense at all, it makes it virtually impossible to expect that your officers will succeed at anything they attempt.  This is exacerbated when you realize that you can create officers and max out their stats, which should guarantee them success at everything, only to watch them fail arbitrarily at other tasks they should be perfect for. As a result, your progress through the game feels artificially drawn out because of some roll of the dice you don't have any influence over.    Apart from the random nature of command success, players will find themselves embarking on quite a lot of conquest and battle missions thanks to launching invasions or defending territory.  Each conflict, which takes place in real time, is divided into two potential outcomes, field battles and sieges, although the overall concept is the same: defeat your opponent within a set number of days, capture their commanders, or force them to retreat from the battlefield.  To help you accomplish these tasks, you'll want to target and eliminate watchtowers, base camps, and other enemy structures that fortify enemy positions, weakening their morale and bolstering yours.  Apart from basic attacks, you can attempt to use skills to confuse, taunt or charge the enemy, retreat and enter keeps to regain strength, and even potentially have enemy leaders betray their side and join with you.   Each fief starts from humble beginnings... However, battles are handled extremely poorly, thanks to a lack of tactical maneuvers that you can provide to your forces.  While you can split them into different groups, and even send certain troops in as backup support, there's no flanking, pincer, ambush or other proven military tactics that you can use to eliminate your enemies.  As a result, troops mindlessly mingle into each other and appear to die by virtue of either superior numbers alone or if their commander triggers a skill before the other general does.  Even turning on the Auto feature, which allows battles to be fought for you is pointless, because it doesn't align soldiers in any particular order or give them any better instructions that you could.  As a result, you're better off manually giving instructions and keeping your fingers crossed that your soldiers eliminate more of the computer's troops than the other way around.   In fact, the lack of structure or even military cohesion makes the newly included option of issuing a Kessen, or winner take all battle, even more frightening.  Nothing's worse than spending dozens of hours consolidating a large number of territories under your control, only to watch your work get eroded away in one fight because your soldiers are idiots. This isn't to say that you can't successfully complete military campaigns  you'll frequently find that depending on your commanders and their skills, even a battle that appears to be completely lost can be turned around and continual unit by unit attention can rescue almost any fight from the brink of failure.  But considering that you need to win battles and gain territory to raise your fame, which in turn, is very important to the development of your land, you'd hope (or at least expect) that the battle mechanics were handled much better.   Who needs tactics?  CHARGE! One thing that does stand out is the transition of the title from the static text screens in previous games to a more animated 3D presentation.  The lands around palaces are modeled in 3D, and you'll notice the expansion and redevelopment of lands from basic fiefs to giant kingdoms as time goes on.  This is somewhat balanced, however, by the blandness of some visuals; while building structures show off some detail, textures are drab and generic, with large patches of plain brown areas with green patches to indicate undeveloped land.  Character models of army units are rather poor as well, which is definitely a disappointment when compared to the historical sequence cutscenes and the portraits of characters, which look great. With the exception of the dialogue that is spoken within cutscenes via Rise to Power's narrator, the game is absent of all spoken lines.  In their place are sound effects and a musical score, which ranges from tranquil and soothing to energetic and cacophonous.Released four years ago in Japan and just recently making it over to these shores, Rise to Power is one of those games that will probably appeal to hardcore historical strategy fans or nostalgic Nobunaga players.  However, considering that the Battle and Strategy modes play a major role within the game, and each hosts key flaws that hampers effective planning for those modes, you're going to have some glaring problems to overlook.", "date": "Feb 6, 2008"}
