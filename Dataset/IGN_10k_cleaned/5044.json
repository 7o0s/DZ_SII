And Duke Nukem, once thought to be the most beloved redneck of the videogame industry, is changing with them. Duke Nukem: Time to Kill is a third-person perspective exploration and adventure game that feels and moves completely different than any previous Duke games in the past. Fortunately, despite the perspective change, and a slowing down of the game, it remains true Duke.  Now, Duke must travel through time in order to take out the alien scum, who are attempting to change history by removing Duke from his roots. You will travel through several time periods, including visiting ancient Rome, a future space age, the Wild West, and many more. In each case, Duke must delve into various new regions, and large, complex worlds, in search of a handful of colored crystals, and total death to any alien slime.  If you're a real Duke fan, you will notice that the game actually is in many ways the same, while having changed drastically. How does that work? Besides being a great multiplayer game, Duke Nukem was always about humor, character, and interactive environments. It was always about exploration in many ways, too. Those characteristics are still here, but are now full blown. There is more exploration and many more puzzles. The game, however, is extremely paced (i.e. slower), and it is thus now truly an adventure/exploration game now, in the ilk of Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia 3D.  A dozen brand new levels are there for your perusal, and a range of alien scum, some familiar and some brand new, appear like cockroaches waiting to be stomped. The weapons haven't changed much, with the pipe bomb, shotgun, gattling gun, and other classics still here, and a few new surprises are in store as well. Duke still looks kinda like Duke, but also kinda like Guile from Street Fighter as well. But his moves are all there, with jumps, kneeling, swimming, running, walking, strafing, and a few others available.   As in the past, the game features single- and two-player version modes. The two-player mode is a decent multiplayer experience which is, as is the single-player game, slower and different than the original. It's just as strategy driven as before, but it's not as frenetic.  And of course, let us not forget the babes, who are here in scantily clad fashion, doing things to poles you would be embarrassed to tell to your mother. What did you say? If you kill them? Let's leave that to the imagination, shall we?This game was difficult for me at first. I had a hard time adjusting to the controls, and to the overall feel. It was slow at first, and it annoyed the holy guacamole out of me. But in time, after a little bit of persistence (and much counseling with Obi-Wan), I came to. I could jump and grab with no problem, shoot while strafing again, and kill without being shot. Just like the old days, sorta...Duke Nukem: Time to Kill is a real hybrid game, a meshing of Tomb Raider and Duke's finest qualities. It's not Tomb Raider, but it's no longer the fast-paced, whiz-bang, first-person shooter of old, either.Let's be straight, or even straighter than straight. (Er, yeah...) Time to Kill is an evolution, and it fits into its new shoes quite well. It's not only worth a look, it's worth buying. You simply need to get over the learning curve, and in some ways forget the old-school shooter of years past. Once I got the hang of it, I was lost for hours searching through the worlds, enjoying the humor and Duke-isms as much as ever.I can't say I'm a big fan of the two-player mode much at all. In my mind this game is best as a single-player experience.", "date": "Oct 16, 1998"}
