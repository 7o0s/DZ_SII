{"name": "Blood Omen 2: Legacy of Kain", "name_review": "Blood Omen 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/21/blood-omen-2-2", "text": "It would be strange to call Kain, the flamboyant, arrogant vampire that changed the destiny of the world in a single stroke, the comeback kid. But in a strange way, he could almost earn that moniker. I guess if he were more like a kid -- and if by definition a comeback meant succeeding -- then the nickname would fit. But neither do.   The true sequel to Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the PlayStation game that launched the series back in 1996, Blood Omen 2 focuses on the early days of Kain's travails, and how he manages to ~come back~ from near death to restore order to the vampires of Nosgoth. He's younger than in the Soul Reaver days, he's recovering from defeat at the hands of the Sarafan Knights, and he's naturally pissed off about everything.    That's really the beauty of Kain -- he's incredibly likeable because he never compromises, always goes for what suits his personal needs best, damn the consequences. In a very true sense, he's a great videogame character because he lives his life the way most of us real humans only fantasize of doing.     The other big ~charm~ of Blood Omen 2 is its strong focus on character, story, and the ongoing power-battles between humans and vampires. Also, without a doubt, the young Kain rocks. He's so much fun to play, it feels good to be bad.    At rare times Blood Omen 2 is good looking. Occasionally, it sucks you into its deep steampunk world torn between vampires and fanatic knights. And progressively, it offers a great set of special vampire moves, from charms to stealth moves to super jumps that yield endlessly good fun.    What's unfortunate about Crystal Dynamics' latest Legacy of Kain offering is that it's a letdown. Besides the many technically insufficiencies, from unreasonably bad slowdown to collision detection issues to production problems in sound and memory management, the gameplay bogs down with redundancy, specifically blas? combat, stagnant door-and-switch progression, and strangely enough, box puzzles, which I thought we'd gotten rid of after the first Soul Reaver.   So, there's all the bad stuff in a body bag. And despite the problems, Blood Omen 2 is an odd winner, a never-say-die vampire of a game. It comes through with a resilient charm that's hard to poinpoint exactly. It has a certain compelling nature that slowly grows on those who play it. So even with its many flaws, Blood Omen 2 succeeds in enough ways to take notice.     Story  I admit it, I'm a huge Legacy of Kain fan, and I'd probably play through the worst Legacy of Kain game on the planet to learn what happens next to Kain and Raziel.   Although by now you should know the basics of the Blood Omen 2 story, I'll refresh your memory. In Blood Omen 2, which takes place 200 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, and thousands of years before Soul Reaver 1, Kain has awakened from a nearly fatal encounter with the leader of the Sarafan Knights, a military faction of mystic zealots whose only mission in life is to rid the planet of vampires. Seems fair enough in real life anyways, since vampires not only suck your blood, but they kill you (you being a human) -- and never in a fair, even-handed way. They drain and they train. But in the game, since you ARE Kain, a blood-sucking vampire, the tables are turned. YOU get to suck the blood and watch humans squirm, twitch and shake as the blood flows from their veins into your mouth. You're the evil bastard, and the experience, I must admit, is a paradoxically lovely one.   But I'm adrift here. Kain awakes! And he's pissed! The scantily clad female vampire, Umah, and the vampire resistance (known as the Cabal), have saved and nursed Kain over the last two centuries, and they need his help. They must defeat the Sarafan Knights who rapidly grow while the vampire population subsequently dwindles. Since none of the humans or dignitaries in the capitol city of Meridian even recognize Kain, he is the one who will save them, he is the one who will walk unabashedly around town regaining power for the vampires once again, draining, maiming, pillaging, and feeding like the blood-thirsty wretch that he is.   The driving principle here is wonderfully pure folly. Kain lost the last battle, and he wants revenge. While he was recovering, many of the vampires in his legion died fighting, they hid, or they joined forces with the Sarafan themselves. Several of Kain's closest lieutenants, in fact, betrayed the vampire race by suiting up with the Sarafan, and each one has what are known as Dark Gifts. Each Gift is a special Vampire ability only sophisticated, superior vampires are capable of handling, and each once belonged to Kain. Naturally, he wants them back.    So, when one absorbs the monumental tasks set before Kain, it's easy to see that his plate overfloweth, if you will. His list of needs is many: He must restore his pride, face, and dignity. He must regain the Dark Gifts, and he must defeat his former allies to achieve that goal. He must beat back the Sarafan Knights, by unlocking the mystery of their glyph technology, and by ultimately defeating the leader of the Sarafan Knights, who also happens to own the Soul Reaver.    This all happens throughout the course of the game. And I've made a bigger deal out of it than I perhaps should have. The story here is less crucial to the game than in Soul Reaver 2, and it's less of a driving force than the story was in Soul Reaver 2. This is an arcade action game that happens to feature an excellent backstory, rather than depending on it. But I couldn't help myself because this game is about excesses, so naturally I indulged a little.   Gameplay  To grind the gameplay down into a few crucial aspects, Blood Omen 2 is about three things, really -- combat, light puzzles, and blood management. When players begin, Kain is weak and needs training. After Umah leads Kain through the well-thought out training process, he goes on his own: to fight, to strengthen himself, and to capture his assailants.    You essentially start out the game with some basic low-level body armor, a set of special arm plates to defend enemy attacks, and your razor-sharp claws. Kain retained his ability to silently glide, so as to attack from behind; his ability to suck blood from a good five feet away (just like in the first game), and to use Stealth. Stealth is the first of the Dark Gifts, and it's a great vampire asset. When players sind and stand in a low foggy film, and they have enough Lore in their Lore Meter (I'll explain later), they can become invisible, making basic kills easier, and making stealth kills especially gruesome.    As Kain progresses, he is able to collect all sorts of excellent weapons, from small knives, long swords, giant cleavers, axes, clubs, and an assortment of other old-school accessories. The trick is he can only carry one at a time, and the weapons take damage, their level of strength indicated by the horizontal weapon at the screen's top.    What's interesting about this combat system is its defense capabilities. Early on in the game's setup, players can choose to defend manually or automatically, and the clear choice is manual because it's more fun. When Kain encounters an enemy and he or she strikes, players must press the defend button at the right time to block it, or they'll be hit. If they defend successfully, Kain will raise or lower his arm or weapon to defend the region of that attack.    The offense side of things is a little less interesting. It's straightforward hack and slashing, with essentially one button, and not long after the game starts the combat grows repetitive. There is a certain level of timing involved, but very little. What keeps the tension going, however, is the growing strength of the enemy, and the possibility of gaining a bigger, better weapon. The best thing about fighting is when it's done. Sucking the enemy's blood afterward is so sinfully pleasurable it's worth the suck every time.   There is another draw. Using each new Dark Gift is exceptionally satisfying. When you can charm some dolt civilian, manipulating him to open a door or get into a fight you know he'll lose, it's just plain fun. When you can perform a super jump from one side of town to the next, or perform a Frenzied Attack, Telekinesis, or Immolate, you begin to comprehend the unnerving experience that vampires are complex, extraordinary creatures.   Defeating each boss, using Dark Gifts for the first time, and draining a difficult-to-beat enemy -- it's moments like these that raise Blood Omen 2 over its many obvious weaknesses. In the end, the combat system works well after a fashion, but its slow, plodding nature, and the simplicity of ordinary battles will wear on you.   What wears on me the most, however, aren't the battles, it's the unfinished world. This game feels rushed, unpolished, and clumsily executed in several areas. For instance, while fighting Kain's foes, they may fall part way through a wall. It's a collision detection issue. That in itself doesn't matter much, but when the weapon he holds also goes through the wall, it's a problem, especially when you want that weapon to replace your own weakened one.    That is actually a small annoyance when compared to the stuttering memory loads that chug so hard the game slows to a 10-15 frames per second, or when the game actually stops for a few seconds when you enter through a door, or turn really quickly into a new location. That just hurts. The framerate issue slows down combat, exploration, some puzzles, and just about everything else in the game, making what should feel like an arcade experience sluggish and blemished.    I'm more upset about those issues than the puzzles. As the game progresses Kain is presented with a collection of puzzles, which range from somewhat entertaining to stupid to measly and aggravating. There are two strange things about these puzzles. One is that several of them made me feel stupid for having figured them out (never a good sign). When you figure out a puzzle, it should have made you feel like you've accomplished something, like it took some small bit of mental process to complete it. Here, you feel dumb for having solved it, and once you start solving these puzzles, the easier they become.    Second, these are block puzzles. BLOCK PUZZLES IN A KAIN GAME = BAD. While this developmental team did not work on Soul Reaver 1, they must have heard the roar of complaints and hyena-like cries from the thousands of gamers who disliked the box puzzles in Soul Reaver. It wasn't as if they were bad in Soul Reaver, it was just that there were so damn many. These block puzzles aren't as challenging, and what's worse is that Kain actually has less controls over them than in Soul Reaver 1. Thus, there are fewer choices to move the boxes, providing fewer firings in the brain, which equals less interest in Blood Omen 2. Remember, BLOCK PUZZLES IN A KAIN GAME = BAD.    The intelligence of the non-player characters could have made up for some of the dull-witted puzzles, but even here, the characters are mixed. Walking into a town square and listening to civilians talk like real people about vampires or art or music is a kick in the pants. But here, I found problems, too. For instance, I could kill a townsperson who was speaking to another townsperson and then walk away. When I return, the remaining person would still be talking to...well, nobody. Bug? Lone incident? It seems to me the game is filled with little unexplained dilemmas just like this.   Lastly, the blood management aspect of the game works well, and it is subtle and balanced enough to feel natural and unforced. Kain has a Blood and a Lore meter, the first of which shows how much blood Kain has remaining. The latter shows how much Lore Kain has. Lore is equivalent, more or less, to a combination of strength, endurance, and constitution. Players search throughout the game looking for victims to blood let, and for special chests containing the remnants of former vampires, whose souls increase Kain's Lore. When his meter maxxes out, Kain grows in strength and power, and the meter empties, thus coercing the players to start again.   It should be noted that the boss battles, of which there are several, deliver a strong variety of obstacles and challenges, and they're long enough and even quite hard. Fighting Kain's old allies is a lot of fun, and beating them is rewarding every time.    Graphics  For those who are wondering, Blood Omen 2 looks different than Soul Reaver 2. The game engine is entirely different, and the artists are different, too (as far as I know). The game displays a massive world that unfolds linearly through combat, door-switches and cutscenes, but it's much plainer than and not nearly as good looking as Soul Reaver 2.   Most of the backgrounds aren't interactive, and the town of Meridian is rather humble looking, I think purposely so. It's not eye-candy, by any means, but I guess that's the intention. When Kain steps outside of the city, into the country and later into the weird Druid castle, for instance, the game does begin to grow more interesting visually. The more gothic looking the game, the better looking it gets.    The characters look decent, but since I'm so used to looking at Soul Reaver 1 and 2 characters, they appear simplistic, uncomplicated, and less ghastly, in comparison. I understand that Kain is younger, less grisly, and less complex than in his later years, but that shouldn't stop the artists from making him stunningly extravagant looking. But unfortunately, he's a visual letdown. As the game progresses, however, Kain dons new armor, different clothes, and he even wears clandestine outfits (with robes and hoods, etc.), changing his appearance enough to surprise and delight me.    Special effects wise, Blood Omen 2 is also a letdown. Everything about it is sub-par. The water is some of the least interesting water I have ever seen in a PlayStation 2 game. The fire is ordinary, and there is very little use of particles, in smashed boxes, flaring things, explosions, etc. Blood Omen 2 is very ordinary looking, despite the game's subject matter, which begs to be dressed up.    Sound  Once again, Crystal Dynamics has tapped a cast of excellent voice talent. The same guy who is the voice actor for Kain in the Soul Reaver series, Simon Templeman, plays Kain here, and he's simply great. His ability to emphasize, pause at the right time, and savor knockout lines is amazing for a videogame, and it's perfect for the likes of Kain. The rest of the cast is also better than average, but it's really Kain that shines the most.    Blood Omen 2 highlights constantly changing music, which changes from moody and atmospheric while exploring, to dramatic and tension-filled when Kain's engaged in combat. The music here, as in Soul Reaver 1 and 2, is outstanding in its ability to create an ominous mood of dread and fear. And what's great about it is that you're the one creating doing the hunting, stalking, and creating the fear!    Overall, the music is excellent and the voice acting and sound effects are top notch.If you stood Blood Omen 2 to up against Crystal Dynamics' other Legacy of Kain game, Soul Reaver 2, you would see a huge difference between the way the two games look and play. Naturally, they are meant to be two different games, but because they are part of the same series and feature the same characters, albeit at various times, it's impossible not to compare them.Soul Reaver 2 is totally story-driven, and focuses on puzzles and less on combat. Blood Omen 2 isn't as story-heavy (though the story is, ironically, the main reason to play it), and relies on action, combat and switch pulling. This one stars Kain, while Soul Reaver features Raziel. Of the two games, I far prefer Soul Reaver 2. It's a better, more polished, more interesting game. But if I had to pick from between which character I liked more, Kain is far more intriguing. So while Blood Omen 2 disappoints as a technical endeavor and grows repetitive and simplistic in combat and progression, there are enough compelling elements -- story, character development, Dark Gifts -- to keep this thing together for a decent play experience. I've got to say that if I weren't a true fan, I'd be disappointed. OK, let me back up, I am disappointed. I admit, I wanted a better-looking game; a faster, more finished title with more areas to explore, better looking locations, smarter puzzles, and better fights. But, I still liked playing it despite its obvious faults. I guess that is a testament to the series' strength. Either than, or my lust for blood...", "date": "Mar 21, 2002"}
