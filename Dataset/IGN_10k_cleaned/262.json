Features Classic and Updated modes Five zones Power-ups and enhanced firepower Link Cable support for two player action For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   Asteroids on the Game Boy is a portable conversion of the remake that hit the PC and PlayStation last year. Syrox, the game's developer, took the original Asteroids design and added a few basic elements to it -- it's definitely not a huge rework. You're essentially an interstellar clean-up crew hired to wipe out asteroids in order to make them safe for travel. Clear out the rogue asteroids, debris, and even the occasional UFO or two, and it's onto the next sector. Large rocks break up into smaller, faster bits...making it harder to target them with your blaster.  The game takes place in a pseudo-overhead viewpoint, and each round starts out with your ship (one of three different crafts) warping in the middle of the action. The idea is simple -- rotate and thrust around the screen, blasting the various types of floating space rocks, crystals, bits of metal...whatever's coasting in the sector. Clear out the area, and you warp out to the next sector.  Admittedly, the first ten rounds are really, really boring. There's no real challenge to wiping out the sectors since the only thing you really have to worry about are the basic asteroids,  But once you get to the more advanced zones it's a lot easier to appreciate what went into the game. For example, you'll find a gravity well in Zone 2, which causes your ship to be pulled into the center. You'll have to keep thrusting around if you want to survive.  In deeper levels, you'll find other hazards like the crystal asteroids that, when destroyed, send smaller fragments homing in on your ship. It really gets tough.  Thankfully, you've got an arsenal of powerups that you can collect. Grab a defensive powerup that will give your ship the ability to turn 180 instantly by pushing down on the D-pad. There's also weapon icons that'll help you in the fight against the space rocks, like proximity mines, homing missiles, and the Armageddon (a spiraling explosion that takes out rocks in a certain radius.  The one problem with the game: at the end of each round, you warp out of the cleared field and warp into the next. This ruins an element that was in the original game -- in classic Asteroids, whenever you cleared out one field, the next would show up, no matter where you were on the screen. So let's say you thrusted around the screen and you clear out the field...pausing to relax in the upper corner of the screen. In Classic Asteroids, you'd stay there while the next asteroid field appeared. In the new game, you're immediately sucked from your resting-place and plopped back in the middle of the screen. I don't like that...it's way too convenient.  The graphics have definitely improved from the original -- rocks tumble and spin, explosions blast out with colorful grace, and every sector features a nicely detailed backdrop such as a planet or starfield. If you prefer the classic vector-style game, it's tucked away in the remake...and it's not hard to find. In some rounds you'll find a wireframe asteroid floating with the rest of the pack. Destroy it and it'll morph into ~1979~, giving you access to the classic game after your current game ends. In all honesty, the classic version isn't spectacular, and could have been better despite the Game Boy's limitations. At the end of an asteroids phase, the screen flashes when the next round shows up, but your ship will always point up -- this causes problems if you're thrusting around the screen at the end of the round. It also sticks you in the same place on the screen when you die -- again, wrong.  I never really cared for the PlayStation rendition of Asteroids, but the game makes a lot more sense on the Game Boy Color handheld. I'd rather slap this puppy into the handheld for a quick game or two than wait for the PlayStation to boot it up. It's a lot of fun, but only in later levels -- skip the first dozen rounds by entering SPACEVAC into the password screen. That'll let you jump to Zone 2 -- a much more interesting round. The classic version is a good inclusion, but if you're going to do it, do it right. Overall, a good game for classic fans -- if you can manage to turn off the nitpick switch in your mind.", "date": "Sep 29, 1999"}
