The game has been available in the states since the end of 1998, but the original Red and Blue editions of Pokmon continue to sell like gangbusters. And there's a reason for that  the game isn't just a fad. It's an awesome game worthy of any gamer's Game Boy library.Features 151 Creatures to Capture Mini-quests Link cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy ColorIn case you haven't noticed it, there's a little craze going on in the world with these guys known as Pokmon. It doesn't matter if you love 'em, hate 'em, or drop-kick 'em, you've at least heard of them, and they're not going away anytime soon. Pokmon started, believe it or not (and you'll be amazed at how many people don't realize it) as a Game Boy RPG back in 1996, in Japan. After two incredibly successful years as a game, a TV show, and a huge merchandise license, the big wigs at Nintendo decided to bring these little guys to the US. And guess what? It caught on like a cold. And chances are, you've caught it as well.Here's the deal in Pokmon: you're a kid named Ash (which can be changed within the game, but for now, you'll be known as Ash), who dreams of being a Pokmon master. So, you leave home to fulfill your dream. You'll travel from town to town, defeating each town's Gym master with the Pokmon you've captured and trained, until you earn all the badges necessary to be considered a Pokmon Master.Pokmon is a very traditional oriented Japanese RPG  overhead view, super deformed characters, tile-based dungeons, random creature encounters...the works. The appeal of Pokmon, however, is the sheer amount of personality in the game. There are literally more than 150 Pokmon to uncover and capture, and your collection becomes a status symbol  how many Pokmon have you found? Or, more importantly, how many Pokmon have you captured?See, when you encounter a wild Pokmon, you must do battle with it  and the only way to do battle with a Pokmon is with another Pokmon. Each of the game's Pokmon has its own strength and weakness, its own attack and defense capabilities. All Pokmon belong to one of fifteen categories, and some types of Pokmon can utterly destroy Pokmon in other categories  Fire to Water, Water to Rock, and so on. It literally becomes a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors as you try and discover which Pokmon works best against others.And the Pokmon you've caught can be traded between your friends  in fact, that's the only real way you're going to be able to catch every single one. Between red and blue, there are about a dozen Pokmon you'll never be able to find in each version. You'll have to find someone with the other color version of Pokmon to trade and catch all the Pokmon in the series.The quest is not extremely difficult, and in some cases it's very straightforward. Still, you'll have to learn strategies in battle to progress through the game, and which Pokmon you choose to train and evolve may affect your progress throughout the quest. Pokmon will literally take you at least 30-40 hours to get through, but that's just to finish the game. Even if you finish the quest, you still might not have all the Pokmon in the game. The challenge to catch 'em all is truly the game's biggest draw.Pokmon really is worthy of being one of the Game Boy system's greatest games  it's not just a fad, a craze, or trend. If you don't have this game in your library, pick one up  it doesn't matter if you pick Blue or Red, they're both the same game. You'll just have to make sure you've got a friend with the other version if you want to catch 'em all.", "date": "Jun 24, 1999"}
