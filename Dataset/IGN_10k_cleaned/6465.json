Like many of you I am completely baffled by the fact that titles like Deer Hunter continue to top the sales charts week after week when there are so many good traditional titles out there. Even so, WizardWorks' latest entry into their hunting line-up, Carnivores, has me impressed. Combining realistic hunting tactics and some pretty slick AIs with a solid 3D engine and a boatload of HUGE dinosaurs, WizardWorks has created a shooting game that may turn a lot of skeptics into believers.  First off, you have to love the premise of the game. In the year 2190, a scout ship discovers a new planet with a human-friendly atmosphere. On closer examination, they found the planet to be filled with bubbling volcanoes, terrifying earthquakes and giant dinosaurs. While it was obvious that the planet wasn't the best place to start a new colony, one group of businessmen saw the new discover as potential source of huge profits. Forging a start-up company named DinoHunt Corp., the group offered the ultimate hunting challenge to those rich enough to meet their prices. Now the world has become a hunting ground for the most ambitious sportsmen of all time and, as you might imagine, you're one of them.  Once you're in the game, you'll have to select which dinosaur you'll be hunting and learn as much about the critter as you can before heading off into the wilderness. As a beginning player, you'll only be allowed to hunt four different dinos, the Parasaurolophus, the Pachycephalosurus, the Stegosaurus, and the Allosaurus until you get enough points to qualify you as an advanced hunter. Once you've selected an animal, a quick mouse drop down to the button marked 'target-zones' will show you the spots on the animal that will bring it down. Shoot anywhere else and at best you'll make it run away. If it's a meat-eater, it's more likely to come after you and eat you. Keep in mind that this isn't Quake and you don't have a health meter  if you get caught by one of those carnivores, you'll die immediately.  Next you'll need to pick a venue for your expedition. The DinoHunt's holdings include six different hunting locations, three of which will be available for you at the beginning of the game. All three are beautiful, ranging from relatively flat grasslands in the Woods of Turan Chocks, to the rocky high ground of the Basmachee Rocks and finishing with the Jungles of Gravitsappa which is a lush rainforest that provides plenty of cover for careful hunters. While most of these locations (even the jungles) don't have all that many trees or obstacles, they're all very plesant and do a great job of getting you into the mood of the game.  Now you're ready to pick you weapon. As a beginner you'll only have two weapons to choose from, the shotgun and the X-bow. The shotgun is an extremely powerful weapon with a wide area of effect, perfect for those hunters who aren't too sure of their aim. It's major drawback is the fact that it issues a loud report every time it's fired, a sound that will scare off herbivores and attract the attention of carnivores. The X-bow on the other hand is completely silent and can be fired several times without spooking the prey you're aiming at. Even so, its drop off factor (you need to aim differently depending on how far you're shooting) and the fact that it's useless as a defensive weapon may scare off beginning players.  The last thing you'll need to do before you set out to hunt is to decide which items you'll be carrying with you and whether or not you'll be hunting for trophy or not. Some items, like the binoculars, the map, the dinosaur call, the wind indicator, and the compass are standard issue, and come with you on a journey whether you ask for them or not. Three others, the radar, which allows you to see all where all of the dinosaurs of the type you are hunting lie on the map, the scent cover, which makes you harder for dinosaurs to smell, and the camouflage which reduces the chance that a dinosaur will see you, will reduce your scores by a certain percentage. While I found it pretty easy to make do without the camo and scent guard, the radar is invaluable to impatient hunters who don't feel like watching and waiting. You can actually add 25% to your score by selecting the tranquilizer option which arms your weapons with a sedative that won't kill the lizards but will instead put them to sleep.  With all of your options selected, you're finally ready to hunt. This is where the game pays off. While there's not much more to do but seek out your target dino and shoot him, the game's fantastic graphics and animation do an excellent job of convincing you that just walking around can be fun. When you do find your prey, you'll find them to be rather wily, bolting at your scent and spotting you if you move to quickly in their field of view. Carnivores will run at you when the see you, swiftly jerking back and forth and finally going in for the kill with a terrific pounce. The end result creates a dangerous feeling atmosphere that adds to the feeling of satisfaction you get from dropping one of the big lizards.  Once you get 100 hunting points you'll be qualified as an advanced hunter and will gain access to two more hunting areas, two more dinos, and a new weapon. The two hunting zones, the Ancient Temple which is a mysterious structure that hides the movements of predators until they're on top of you, and the Pyramids of Shmu-Hadron which offers fast plains for you to try and remain hidden in, are much more difficult terrains to try and use basic hunting tricks in. In order to make it to expert, you'll have to learn how to use the ground to your advantage instead of working against it. Since you'll be hunting two very dangerous new animals, the Triceratops, which is deadly when angry (read: wounded) and the Velociraptor which is always deadly, you'll need to learn it all very fast as well. Fortunately you'll have access to the sniper rifle, a gun with the same range as your binoculars. While this may seem to make things easier at first, don't forget that those predators are often attracted by the sound of your gun, and with the narrow focus of the sniper rifle, you're unlikely to be able and stop their charge.  Finally, after you've accumulated 300 points you'll be an expert hunter and will be able to chase after the T-Rex. Unlike the other carnivores, you could be a little coy at times, the T-Rex knows no fear at all. Unfortunately, if he ever sees you, you're probably going to die. The only spot that you can hit the Goliath and live is in his eye, a tough target if you're standing 50 yards away. When I finally managed to fell one on my own, I was flooded with a sense of relief rather than pride. Unfortunately, this exciting moment cam after I had been playing the game for only three hours.  The biggest problem with Carnivores is that it's too damn easy. Even with all of the gear cut off, most players will be able to fill their trophy rooms in a couple of play sessions. Although I had a load of fun playing the game, in two days I felt like I had exhausted every option available to me. It's really too bad that once you kill off a T-Rex you aren't given different options to play with. I also would like to see some sort of multiplayer link that would let a team of humans compete and see who can bag the biggest lizard.  All in all, Carnivores is a surprisingly entertaining game that just doesn't have enough options to keep players busy for the long term. If you're in to hunting games, or you just like dinosaurs, you should definitely give this game a shot. If you're looking for a game that's going to offer you weeks and weeks of entertainment though, you're better off giving this one a miss.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Dec 31, 1998"}
