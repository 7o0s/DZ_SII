And why not grace this fun little dart sim with that most mindless of cartoon icons, SpongeBob Squarepants?   Features:   Play with the residents of Bikini Bottom  Two-player options  Create custom rules   SpongeBob Squarepants Darts is not designed to consume hours on end. Rather, the game is perfect as a five-minute distraction while waiting in line at the bank, between classes, or waiting for your girlfriend to buy shoes. (Right, like that's a five-minute ordeal.)   SpongeBob Squarepants Darts expertly uses its license by dropping some fun Bikini Bottom trimmings over a solid game of darts. You play against SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabbs, and Squidward in an aquatic paradise -- but they never really intrude on the essence of darts. The dart board itself is regulation -- no goofball changes or additions that would confuse a casual gamers.   You throw darts by manipulating an on-screen hand as it swoops across the board. The hand is affected by inertia and gravity, it's constantly floating to the bottom of the screen, so it's up to you to guide it to the screen of the board. Press too hard and the hand flies over the center, press too little and it settles into the screen's basement.   It's a good system, but probably still to easy to master. All you essentially need to do to score a bullseye is line the hand up between the two score boxes on the bottom of the screen then press up with one finger hovering over the ~5~ button, which tosses the dart. Nuances like arcing have been stripped away, too.   You have several game choices in SpongeBob Squarepants Darts. You can play a two-player game with a friend, passing the phone back and forth, You can play a quick solo match. Or you can tour Bikini Bottom and challenge the underwater burg's residents. Play 501 or 301, or if you like, change up several other rules.  SpongeBob Squarepants Darts is not going to satisfy the most diehard dart players on the planet, but, well, tough darts. What the game does manage is offer a great approximation of darts for casual gamers that don't want to worry about things like force or arcing. And fans of the most excellent cartoon will appreciate the presence of SB and his pals. If you're looking for just a temporary time waster, SpongeBob Squarepants Darts is a good way to spend a few bucks.", "date": "Sep 16, 2004"}
