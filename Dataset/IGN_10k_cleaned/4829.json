Most recently, Pandora Tomorrow has shot to the top of the charts -- not only because it's a great game, but because it doesn't disappoint fans of the console and PC versions by adhering remarkably close to the source materal, despite a 2-D squish job.   But that's a one-player action/stealth game. Can Gameloft bring the million-selling Rainbow Six 3 squad-based shooter to handsets as successfully? After multiple play tests, we answer in the affirmative.   Features:   Squad-based action  Ten levels in three environments  Multiple weapons   Tom Clancy titles are known for their excellent storytelling. Rainbow Six 3's yarn is quite good, too, even if it isn't presented as seamlessly as in other TC titles. It's 2007, and America is under an oil embargo from the rest of the world. The only remaining supplier of oil is Venezuela. (Creepy how this seems like a distinct possibility, isn't it?) A terrorist organization has descended on the V, determined to disrupt the flow of oil and hold us economic hostage.   That's where the Rainbow Six squad comes in. You and your men are sent in to repel terrorist forces and rescue hostages. Using a variety of weapons and gear, like flash grenades that temporarily blind your foes, it's up to you to save America's oil supply and thwart this international thuggery.   The first difference noted in Rainbow Six 3 is the elimination for some team members. There are only two squad mates in play at a time because, well, do you think your handset could have handled four soldiers as well as terrorist thugs and hostages? The loss isn't felt for long at all, as there is plenty of action to keep these two troopers busy.   There are ten missions total with objectives like saving innocents, diffusing bombs, and eliminating snipers. Controlling your men in these missions is a breeze, thanks to an intuitive control scheme and game interface. You must direct your men to their destination with a cursor, always keeping an eye open for danger.   Should an enemy come into view, the movement cursor automatically becomes a fire cursor when placed on the thug. Press ~5~ to open fire and watch blood spurt from his wounds. Violent? Sure, but you're not up against My Little Pony here. You can use frag grenades to shatter their bodies instead of going directly into harm's way. Or use a sniper rifle to pick off foes on the rooftops.      The game just flows brilliantly. You learn quickly what decisions need to be made, and how timing is everything in the life of a solider. You have to understand that diffusing a bomb takes time, and an enemy may approach before you're done disarming it. You have to think one step ahead and secure locations before embarking on time-consuming tasks.   Rainbow Six 3 looks fantastic, especially on the QD we used for review purposes. The environments look great and expertly detailed for a cellphone game, such as the appropriately snowy Swiss village and the posh villa in Curacao. The soldiers and terrorist are well drawn with good animation. And how can you not like those fat spurts of blood that hit the floor with a wet thud? Rainbow Six 3 opens with a strum and drang jingle, but the game then settles into sound effects, such as gunshots.Rainbow Six 3 is, easily, one of the best handset games we've played in recent memory -- a further testament to what's possible when a developer understands the hardware and programs appropriately. This go-go version of Rainbow Six 3 understands that by no means can even an N-gage QD handle something like the console/PC version, so its strips the essentials from the game and applies them to a similar experience that caters to the strengths (and weaknesses) of a cellphone.", "date": "Jul 8, 2004"}
