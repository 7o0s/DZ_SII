The first title out of this partnership is the Game Boy Advance version of Microsoft's Monster Truck Madness series, and even with the slight development rough spots the project came off quite smoothly in the move from the PC to the handheld market. Even with the glut of racing titles on the Game Boy Advance, Monster Truck Madness is an impressive effort in both gameplay and technology...but it's a shame that it's only for single player outings. Features Ten monster trucks Ten different tracks Time trial mode Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Monster Truck Madness is loosely based upon the design originally brought to market on the PC, and later on the Nintendo 64 console. The GBA title, developed by Australian studio Tantalus, is a carnage-encouraging racing design featuring a line-up of ten different and licensed monster trucks and ten different tracks of varying terrain. The idea is to come in first after three laps or checkpoints, a task which will unlock and give players access to previously unaccessible trucks and tracks. To pull this off, players will have to collect power-up icons that will temporarily affect the player's or computer opponents' vehicles; some will give a temporary boost of speed or super traction, while others will cause the opposition to explode in place or shrink to half their size. The game also encourages destruction by having a ~rampage~ power bar; every time the player runs over a track-side obstacle, the bar increases. Top it out, and the vehicle powers up with an insane boost in speed.  Tantalus first attempted a 3D-style racing engine in the Acclaim-published ATV: Quad Power Racing. The bland game design was more overwhelming than the team's 3D technology, but after experiencing the second generation of the engine it's clear that the studio was just getting their feet wet; Monster Truck Madness is a much more complete racing package this time around, and it's an impressive looking game to boot. The game is a mixture of 2D and 3D elements to create a very believable, almost PSX-quality engine; Monster Truck Madness utilizes a fully texture-mapped 3D model for the player's vehicle, interacting on top of a smoothly flowing terrain of hills and bumps as well as opposing vehicles and obstacles scattered around as well-drawn sprite objects.   The engine not only allows for visible vehicle damage, but it also enables the developer to create believable, albeit cartoony, truck physics. Depending on the selected vehicle's abilities, the truck will go airborne after hitting bumps and jumps, forcing the player to have proper control over how the wheels are aimed before and after the inclines. Half of Monster Truck Madness' gameplay is in keeping the heavy trucks from leaving the road and losing speed, and the developers pull off an engine that makes the vehicles feel right.  The engine offers additional versatility in the form of multiple camera views; players can choose to have the viewpoint behind the vehicle, at a much higher perspective, or right on the vehicle's bumper. And while this bumper-camera is limited to going in the proper direction (the camera zooms out if the vehicle faces the opposite way), Monster Truck Madness features the most believable first-person view in a GBA racing game. Hands down.  It's just a shame that, as fun as the racing game is, Monster Truck Madness is missing some key functionality. Most obvious is the lack of any sort of multiplayer support; this game only features game options for a single player, so fans of link cable gaming shouldn't be expecting to put their cables or extra systems to use. Secondly, despite the game having a cartridge save and a record-keeping mode, the statistics it saves doesn't record which player scored the saved race time. So, you can head into the game records and check the best times...but you have absolutely no idea if that time is yours or simply the default time programmed into the cartridge by the developers. But even with that said, Monster Truck Madness is a quality racing title. The lack of statistics and multiplayer mode is a shame, absolutely, but the design's core is important as well, and the racing action is definitely well produced on the limited Game Boy Advance hardware. Even better, after seeing the leap the developers made over its previous 3D racing game, it makes us even more eager to play Tantalus' upcoming Top Gear Rally conversion on the Game Boy Advance.", "date": "Aug 19, 2003"}
