Remember thinking that those little army guys would be a great game concept? Pardon me while I wax nostalgic... When I was a little kid my Dad gave me his collection of army men. After I had eaten a few of them, my folks took them away again. As I grew I became a little wiser and a lot less hungry and my parents gave them back to me. Anyway, it was a helluva lot of fun when I was a kid.  Unfortunately, none of that pleasure is present in this game. I really don't understand what's going on here. I mean all the complaints about the first game centered around the crappy controls and the lack of any sense that these are toys you're playing with. Those same problems plague the sequel. The simple point and click interface is surprisingly hard to use and the environments don't give you much sense that these guys are only a few inches tall.  I had control problems from day one. The interface looks like it should be smooth and easy. You just point at the soldier you want to command and then click on his destination or his target. That's it-you shoot, you move and not much else. Sometimes the pathfinder works beautifully, better than any other game I've seen. Soldiers can go from one end of the map to the other, running over and around numerous obstacles. On the other hand, sometimes your guys can't find their way around the corner of a building.  I also had real trouble getting the guys moving in groups. You can select a group of soldiers by clicking and dragging. Everyone in the box becomes selected. I guess some of the other soldiers feel left out because they'll begin to follow your selected troops. I can't tell you how frustrating that is, having unselected troops run around on their own. Also, don't ever move tanks and foot soldiers in the same group. The AI isn't savvy enough to get the foot troops out of the way of the tanks. You'll end up running over your own guys if you're not very, very careful.  Your AI isn't smart enough to hold fire when a friendly unit blocks his line of sight. Imagine Sarge heading up a tank column and driving into enemy territory. Suddenly you spot the enemy tanks. You open fire. The guy behind you isn't smart enough to move a few feet to the side. Instead he begins to shoot at the enemy but hits you instead! You really don't have time to position everyone individually. It would be nice if you didn't have to worry about being killed by your own guys.  The enemy AI seems plenty smart compared to yours. Sure, you can trick him into the friendly fire trap, but not too often. They work together and respond to tactical changes. Your own troops won't stop to engage the enemy if they are under the influence of a move order. Which means they'll run right past an enemy soldier without even noticing. The enemy guy notices however, and he'll slaughter your troops.  As far as the settings and environments you fight in go, don't expect too much. The first mission takes place on a kitchen counter but it's over too soon. The next batch of missions all take place in the backyard, but there's nothing around to give you a sense of scale. These guys might as well be real army men. Throw a tennis shoe in the yard for crying out loud. Give me something to establish a sense of scale. Instead, there are trains and planes and radio towers and none of them look like toys. I know from looking at the art for this game that there are other locations that are more toy-like, but I was too frustrated with the sloppy mechanics of the game to reach these levels.  The weapons do give this game a little scale. You can pick up magnifying glasses or aerosol cans to use on your enemies. These weapons can be used anywhere on the map, regardless of where your soldiers are and are really a joy to watch. You also get M80s which you can strap to the back of enemy soldiers. Guys with M80s strapped to them have nothing to live for and will turn and run at the first soldier they see. Sometimes this is a friendly unit, sometimes it's a hostile. If the other guy can't get out of the way soon enough...BAMMM! They both get it.  In terms of vehicles, don't look for anything too surprising. You can commandeer tanks, half-tracks, jeeps and the all important PT boat. Most of the vehicles are okay in terms of steering and weapons but the tanks really don't perform. They're slow and hard to maneuver. Apparently, you can't turn the turret without firing it. That's too bad if you accidentally kill some of your own guys while turning the turret to face the enemy.  A new multi-player version has been added and I have to say that I'm a big fan. You can play in one of several different variants-capture the flag, king of the hill, black flag and deathmatch. There are a few different maps to play on, too. You can assign each of four teams an amount of plastic to spend in the deployment phase. They use this plastic to purchase units or upgrades. There's also a new multi-player structure, the pillbox. You can place a rifle, machine gun or bazooka in one of these babies. They're great for defense.  All in all, this game was very disappointing. After all the control and environment issues of the first game, it's surprising how little has been fixed here. Single player missions are frustrating due to a lack of control and a lack of scale. Multi-player gaming is fun (and free apart from your own connection costs) but you still have control problems there too. Do yourself a favor before you buy this one. Think about how many real army men you could get for the same amount of money. Just think about it.  -- Stephen Butts Even though the series is pretty crap on other systems, Army Men has turned out good not just once, but twice on the Game Boy Color. The addition of the link cable is definitely welcome, but it could've used a bit more in the design. We're just knocking a point off from last year's score because it's just not that big of a leap or that huge of a design change to justify a must-have purchase.", "date": "Apr 6, 1999"}
