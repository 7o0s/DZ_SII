Aladdin made the jump from Genesis to Game Boy Color thanks to Ubi Soft and Crawfish earlier this month, but the transition for that game was more than a little bumpy. A much better second attempt at the move has been made from Activision and Torus Games (Duke Nukem, Yoda Stories) in the form of The Lion King: Simba's Mighty Adventure. As good as the move has been, its problems lie in the past -- the same control issues that hindered the console version a few years ago show up here, too.  Features 10 levels Four minigames Link cable mode for two players Password save Only for Game Boy Color  In the game, you play as Simba as he grows from cub to lion. The plot has been hacked for consistency's sake, so the levels are based on situations from the film but don't play out as linearly. Each level has a goal, but it's generally the same from the get-go -- wander through the level collecting stars and bouncing on enemies, leaping up to climb up on trees and ledges to reach more remote locations and tokens. In the early stages, Simba can roar but it's just for show, later on when Simba grows his mane the roar will cause enemies to run away -- handy for the enemies that charge after you or take a few pounces to eliminate. Collecting 100 stars will earn an extra life, but collecting all five pieces of the lion amulet will earn a play in one of the game's four mini challenges featuring Timon and Pumbaa. These minigames range from the lame to the downright clever, including a tennis game featuring bugs instead of balls.  The conversion from 16-bit to 8-bit isn't completely direct -- the ideas and controls are still intact, but the levels have been changed to be more Game Boy Color friendly. Several stages from the Genesis and SNES editions have been changed, and some, like the ~Just Can't Wait to be King~ animal romp on giraffe's heads have been taken out completely. The wildebeest stampede scene is in the Game Boy Color, but it's been changed to a top-down perspective instead of the pseudo-3D viewpoint of the 16-bit editions. But thanks to the release of the direct-to-video Lion King II movie, this game continues on after the battle with Scar -- four more levels have been added where Simba must rescue his daughter Kiara, including a modified version of the wildebeest round, swimming from crocodiles in an African river.  The game is a nicely put together platformer -- smooth animation and fast action, with lots of variety thanks to the minigames and changing level perspective. The one real hitch is the strange control when jumping -- it's difficult to pinpoint a short jump. Sometimes you overshoot, sometimes undershoot, and lots of times just miss a ledge because you weren't standing in the exact spot necessary when leaping. It's a real learning curve trying to control Simba properly, and even when you blow through half the game you'll still find it hard to tell him what to do properly.  The graphics are also well drawn -- along with the already mentioned smooth animation, the developers use the Game Boy Color's high-color mode for still scenes from the movies. There's an awkward transition for when you go from cub Simba to adult Simba, since the adult character is actually smaller than the cub sprite.  Strangely, this game features absolutely no music from the movie -- instead, it has only two repetitive in-game tunes. Thankfully the development team offered a Music Volume feature in the options.  But there's one true gem in this game -- the link cable ~Tag Mode.~  Surprisingly, this level is a lot of fun -- each character plays as Simba or Nala (the same sprite with a slightly different color palette), and the idea is to hold onto the level's star for as long as you can. If the other player touches you, you snag the star and his clock begins to count down. First person to waste all the time on his clock loses. The challenge is to romp around without clinging to ledges, since dangling makes you a prime target for a tag. It's a great addition, and every platform game should include something this clever for two players.  As much as I was disappointed with Aladdin on the Game Boy Color, if that game was better produced for the handheld, it would have been the better Disney platformer because of its better level layouts and control. But Lion King is a much, much more impressive production thanks to greater attention to detail, as well as more features and games to play. The actual adventure is a little on the easy and short side, but the minigames and link cable mode makes Lion King a title to continue playing even after the main game's completed. It's just a shame the controls weren't tweaked from the original design, but otherwise it's a quality platformer and a great game for the kiddies.", "date": "Dec 1, 2000"}
