And how come they're all ported from the older 32-bit systems? Anyway, Viewpoint is one such a shooter, and, while it fulfills every shooter prerequisite - lots of ships and obstacles to shoot at - it fails in the most important category: fun.  Sure, the graphics are nice, as far as these things go, but the control is incredibly slow. And, to confound things even more, the difficulty level has been set way too high. No one wants to play a tough game with awful control no matter how good it looks. It only makes things all the more frustrating. With wave after wave of obstacles that get in your way, and you with hardly any way of destroying them or moving out of the way, well, there's just no point. Avoid.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
