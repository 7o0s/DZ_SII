Unique for any system, but only on PlayStation, Sled Storm illustrates how games are going beyond the standard boundaries of traditional racers. The snowmobiles are called ~sleds,~ and the races ~snocross,~ but the game mixes up mid-air tricks and traditional driving skills, and formulates something completely different.  Gameplay One of the best traits of this game is that 95% of what you see and play is real. This is really what these crazy, radical folks do for fun and maybe even a bit of profit. I've ridden snowmobiles before and the sleds in this game move just like the real thing. The only you don't get is the strong smell of gas, and that's no loss. These things made a stink. Still, these machines are accurate as hell. They jerk, bump, slip, jump, slide and roar just like the real thing.   As with any good game, Sled Storm is particularly deep in details. The courses are well designed in the standard way (i.e. mixed and various), but they're also created with depth and vision. Players can take the standard trail to complete a course, or trek into the wilderness to discover new routes, jumps, and shortcuts -- which is where the replay value and depth comes down like an avalanche. You won't believe how many little hidden areas are packed in here! Oddly colored walls can be broken through, railroads driven on, lakes skidded across, and cliffs jumped from! Oh, did you see a snowman or an igloo? Bust through them for points! Break down signs and destroy stuff and be rewarded! Now that's a good thing.  For those who believe that there aren't enough courses here, think again. Sled Storm initially offers two areas, Open Mountain and Supersnocross. Open Mountain is the friendlier of the two, and offers the wild shortcuts and creative mountain passes. It takes place along downhill trails and enables players to open up fog, night, and new courses among others. Supersnocross is a more like a supercross course, specifically highlighting stunts. The riders are more competitive and skilled here, so don't be downtrodden if you can't win right off the bat. Simply go back to Open Mountain, upgrade your sled, and then come back. In Supersnowcross you open up new and different characters.   Players have an excellent choice of upgrade items, ranging from frames, better treads, halogen headlights, single pipes, new chips, shims, and brakes, many of which have secondary or more additions. Character choices are based on top speed, acceleration, handling, stability, and tricks.  For those folks familiar with EA's Road Rash, and the weak link in its upgrade system, you might think twice here. This one is tight. You're given five sleds to race with, and to move on to new courses, you must place first. Anything else and you lose the points from that race.   What I like about the reward system is that it provides for two different kinds of racers, but you must learn both the trick and speed skills to benefit. Players earn more points for pulling off tricks, less for winning. So, your pal in third place may have earned more points than you because he styled out with more combos, but you took first place, so you move on. He doesn't. In the end, you've got to pull off the big moves and learn to maintain your cool to win. As far as balance goes, Sled Storm is superb.   In the same way that fourth- or third-place players can earn more style points than you in first place, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) acts to defeat you with a good deal of aggression and obsession for tricks. The AI is just short of brilliant. Don't be surprised when a sled comes up beside you on a narrow road and knocks you off, or runs you over while you're down. These guys are ruthless. The AI is constantly nailing fatties (er, moves) every chance it gets. Additionally, the AI riders won't follow the same path every time either, which means more brownie points for the programmers. The AI actually acts somewhat like a human (just like it's supposed to!), adding to the difficulty and challenge of your race.   Last but least, Sled Storm offers four-person gameplay. Yep, these guys did it, and did it well. Plug in a multitap, find three more controllers and engage in four-player split-screen action. Slowdown happens, the textures are fewer and less detailed, and it's harder to see each player, but it's still fun, damnit! Few games boast the four-player split-screen action, and this just goes to show that the Sled Storm team wanted a gamers game, one that had all the cool necessities.   Few things drag down Sled Storm's gameplay. But I do have complaints. My biggest gripes are that the camera angle is too low. The low angle prevents players from seeing too far ahead. This trick, not surprisingly, prevents players from seeing pop-up, and also adds to the challenge of the tracks. That's a minor quibble.   In terms of sheer gameplay, the realistic feel of the sleds themselves is so damned accurate, players are going to get annoyed with it. It's a double edged-sword. Slipping across icy areas, incessantly bumping around like a frickin' bucking bronco, and having a monstrous turning radius all happen in real life, but Sled Storm could have been a little more forgiving. The fact is gamers want both realism and arcade forgiveness, and Sled Storm leans toward simulation. It'd not bad, just a little limiting.  Graphics The PlayStation is now coming into its fifth year, and programmers have learned almost everything there is to know about its 2 MB RAM bottleneck, large load times, polygon power, and lighting effects. Sled Storm maximizes the effects in every possible area, performing a killer trio of great animation sequences, great course design, and mixing detailed textures with Gourard and flat shaded textures.  In regard to animation Sled Storm is loaded with the most important details. Each rider is jammed with dozens of animations. Because of a five-point physics model, each rider's sense of balance is amazing. There are several sequences of riders falling off, a handful of them almost falling off, and even more of riders simple adjusting to terrain, each reacting to gravity with realism. That's not even including the 50 move animations!   The environments are killer. I love the way snow altered gameplay. Few games have done such a good job with the look and feel of snow. It falls and shifts in mid-air with the changing wind, rooster tails spray from behind your sled, and powder hills blockades break up, giving way to shortcuts, pitfalls and new pathways. The sleds act differently depending on whether you're on ice, in deep powder, or on a nicely packed slope, making for succinct differences.   The developer's realistic knowledge of the PlayStation's abilities, and a good measurement of its texture capacity work to the game's advantage over and over again. The mixture of different kinds of texture maps is efficient. Streamline sleds and colorful, but not overly detailed racers help to keep the frame rate up. The seemingly solid sense of speed is countered by constantly snaking courses and different terrain, which actually slows you down. But it doesn't seem like it. Little tricks like this keep the frame rate from falling, pop-up from happening, and realism from dragging. Overall, Sled Storm is a classic example of great course design, and a design team of knowing its terrain and limitations.  Sound With the exception of the helpful but lame voices calling out each of your mid-air moves, the music and sound effects in Sled Storm are excellent. Of course, players can adjust everything, so eliminating the voices is no problem. The bands are hardcore, plentiful, and alternative, ranging from Rob Zombie, Econoline Crush, and Uberzone, to E-Z Rollers and Dom and Roland. Yet another cool trick was fitting music selections into the load screens. Players can pick from the initial seven songs while a game is loading, a nice touch that bides those seemingly long load time. Also, more songs are available, but players will have to figure out how to access them.I liked this game from the beginning. It's well designed, smart looking, and realistic as they come. What's more is that Sled Storm is an atypical effort that ventures into an area where few have tread. From the slick, easy-to-access interface, to the muscular upgrade system, to the deep, well-designed courses, Sled Storm is addictive and fun. I'm not a huge fan of the character choices, They're just cardboard cutouts of ~cool~ personalities, and they really don't appear as personalities on the course, but they do the trick. The funny thing is I kept thinking, ~this game is cool, but....~ But i could fiind very few things wrong it. I guess you could complain about the blocky, or rather, triangular night lighting sequences, and yes, this game would look gorgeous on a PC or the Dreamcast, but it's well-rounded game that has taken care of the little problems tidily. In the end, I'm hoping this game does extremely well and a sequel is in the works. I just want to play the next one! back to unlocking all of those courses!", "date": "Aug 25, 1999"}
