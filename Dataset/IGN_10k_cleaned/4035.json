The quiz show phenom that's no longer phenomenal, ~Who Wants to be a Millionaire?~ has finally made the leap to cellphones, and the results are surprising.    For a decidedly unfresh concept, this game works.    Features:  Constantly updated trivia  Follows show theme    It's hard not to go into this game in a good mood. Before it even starts, there is a warning screen that alerts the player that there is no actual money awarded for playing and/or winning. Did somebody out there really need this clarified? Did some yahoo in his chair actually finish playing and then wait by his mailbox for a six-figure check from ABC?    When you boot up Millionaire, the game tries to connect to a network to download fresh trivia questions. We say ~try~ because the first three times we attempted to do this, it crapped out. The we played two games, then it crapped out some more. This cycle continued. As entertaining as the game actually is, that kind of frustration really works to undo the grin the aforementioned ~warning~ screen causes.    Once Qs and As are actually DL'd, the game begins. The prize ladder unfurls on the screen, working its way up to the big prize of a cool mil. And then it's right into the game. You still have three lifelines. And really, the only one you can trust is the 50/50. Because, just like in real life, sometimes the audience is wrong, and sometimes the friend you call is a complete dummy.    The questions range from ridiculously easy to gratingly hard. This is actually the kind of game where you want to get other people involved, since all it takes is wrong wrong answer to send you back to zero. (And to a potential ~network error~ message as the game tries to pull in some new questions.)    The television show was a hit for several reasons. The idea was genius -- winning a million is hard to beat for drama. But people also tuned in to see Regis in his shiny ties, hear him mutter the catchphrase (and see if he could talk the contestant out of the right answer -- always a classic moment), and check the heavy production values, like the ominous music and the seizure-inducing lighting rigs. Sadly, the game has no Regis and no audio.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
