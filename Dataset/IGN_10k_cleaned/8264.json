Say, that instead of crazy Nazis rampaging through Europe, World War II was an epic struggle against a race of extraterrestrials, hell-bent on global domination and stuffing people into tiny tubes. Actually, that's ridiculous. Let's say, instead, Halo never happened - that, frankly would make our lives much easier. Then we could say, ~Woo! Resistance! Best console FPS ever!~ and go home.Unfortunately, bending the fabric of time to suit our own editorial needs isn't in the job description. Plus, given the importance of Insomniac's Resistance: Fall of Man as one of Sony's top-tier first-party launch offerings, it probably deserves slightly more attention than a paragraph and a half. With MotorStorm catering for the fuel-junkies among us, it's left to Resistance to fill that big hole marked 'FPS', thus ensuring Sony's got something on shelves to satisfy the basic needs of those all-important hardcore early-adopters come PS3's European arrival. Imaginative weapons are one of Resistance's highlights. Thankfully then, with the proven might of Insomniac behind it, Resistance manages to be a solid, entertaining - if somewhat uninspired - genre entry. Things start off promisingly enough with that much-touted alternate timeline set-up. Combining the perennially popular WWII setting that's been clogging up the FPS market since Medal of Honor cocked both barrels with everybody's favourite ammo-fodder, razor-toothed interplanetary invaders, Resistance would seriously have to go out of its way not to appeal to its target audience. Unfortunately, in the early stages at least, the game feels as calculated and by-the-numbers as that might suggest.By now, we've all had plenty of time to admire the many staggering shades of brown that permeate the majority of WWII shooters. We've admired crumbling debris in every shape and size, whether it's smeared with current-gen textural murk or dabbled with fancy next-gen bump-maps. It's slightly depressing then to find that the world Resistance presents, alien-tinged or otherwise, is straight out of the big book of FPS  clichs - something of a surprise given Insomniac's artistic pedigree. Set-piece battles are incredibly immersive, thanks to brilliant choreography. Likewise enemy AI is solid, if not spectacular, your weapon of choice is a bogstandard military-issue M5A3 Carbine - plus a tarted-up plasma gun - and, ooh, if you stay out of trouble long enough, your health meter tops back up. In fact, initially, everything Resistance has to offer is so staggeringly humdrum and run-of-the-mill, you can't help but question why Insomniac bothered in the first place. Truthfully too, it takes a good while before the game manages to free itself from the shackles of mediocrity, with all the usual FPS tick boxes dutifully checked.That's not to say that Resistance isn't entertaining to begin with - it's polished, well-paced and manages to supply that all-important sense of visceral brutality. There's just a distinct lack of, well, tension or excitement. Then two things happen: firstly, the game throws you into the frontline of a beautifully choreographed assault against the alien threat, in Manchester of all places. It's here that Insomniac's trademark craftsmanship starts to show itself.    While largely unspectacular on a technical level, Resistance's graphics engine can really throw some $#&% around. With the city's devastated skyline framing the mayhem below, debris flies through the air, explosions rip the ground from under your feet, allies fight and fall while dozens and dozens of enemies seemingly stack the odds against you.Sure, we've seen this sort of thing before, but it's the attention to detail and breathtaking orchestration that really impresses. Best of all, the Manchester conflict is the first of many equally well-realised, heart-pounding set-pieces, liberally scattered throughout the game. Unfortunately, these moments are something of a double-edged sword, throwing the more humdrum, bogstandard FPS sequences in Resistance - of which there are plenty - into sharp relief. Yes, another underground bunker. Thankfully there's not a vent in sight. Luckily though, Insomniac's other trump card provides plenty to distract your attention away from the umpteenth underground bunker and cookie-cutter enemy guaranteed to be up ahead. We're talking weapons, of course - and what weapons they are. With a few exceptions, your arsenal weighs firmly down on the imaginative side and - with each gun equipped with a frequently outlandish secondary fire mode - they're an incredibly satisfying bunch of death bringers. Whether we're talking the Auger with its wall-penetrating projectiles and portable shield, the rapid-fire XR-005 Hailstorm with its devastating auto-turret or the L23 Fareye sniper, with its time-slowing concentration mode, weapons are always well-balanced and a joy to use.It's just a shame that so few occasions really make the most of your arsenal. By and large, all this impressive firepower is made redundant by a lack of creativity in level design. Aside from a handful of more powerful enemies and the occasional scenario, it really doesn't matter if you're pumping away with your Bullseye or Rossmore 236. Resistance would have benefited greatly if the strategic potential of your vastly different weapons had been put to some use. If you're a fan of brown, then Resistance is the game for you! Despite the quality peaks and troughs evident in the single-player game, we have far less hesitation in recommending Resistance's online component. Put simply, it's excellent. With Deathmatch, Conversion, Team Deathmatch, Meldown, Capture the Flag and Assault modes, there's plenty to sink your teeth into. What's more, individual maps are all superbly designed. Even better, Insomniac's done a standout job technically - individual games can be tailored to suit all manner of needs and, regardless of whether there're eight or 40 players on a map, lag is almost non-existant. Throw in a 60-tier ranking system and tools for clan creation and you'd be hard-pushed to ask for anything more. Oh, and did we mention that it's a damn riot?From a single-player perspective then, Resistance is a funny one. It's a good, solid entry into the FPS genre with some truly stand-out moments and genuine splashes of ingenuity. Unfortunately though, there just isn't enough of either and, while the game remains consistently enjoyable, shooter fans are likely to find proceedings a little too familiar, ultimately preventing Resistance from rubbing shoulders with the upper echelons of the FPS contenders. Online though and things are a slightly different matter - featuring a host of modes and supremely well-balanced gameplay, it's an addictive and compulsive proposition.Ultimately, solo players can expect an enjoyable, if not exceptional, time with Resistance  and with entertaining offline multiplayer and co-op support, that might just be enough to satiate those FPS cravings in those first few post-launch months. If youve got even the slightest interest in taking your PS3 online however, then  even in its current form  you can do far, far worse that Resistance. Whats more, with Insomniac pledging to expand and improve online play as time goes on, it looks like PS3 shooter fans might have found their first keeper.", "date": "Mar 22, 2007"}
