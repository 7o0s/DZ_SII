{"name": "Counter-Strike", "name_review": "Counter-Strike", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/19/counter-strike", "text": "When Counter-Strike was announced back at E3 2002, the impact of the name itself and the growing momentum of Xbox convinced many observers that Microsoft's home console was getting an enhanced online shooter worthy of the PC phenom's legacy. Even if it wasn't going to be the next Halo, the idea of Counter-Strike on Xbox was titillating because it was going to be exclusive to the system --a polite way of saying it wouldn't be constrained by simultaneous development on PS2. A year and half later, Counter-Strike is here and while much has changed in the perception and popularity of Xbox, the port of the PC modification is a near perfect representative of the extremely popular online game. Almost too perfect.     Counter-Strike scores in that it accomplishes what it set out to do. It's just too bad Counter-Strike was never intended to advance the cause of Xbox as a landmark title worthy of its powerful name and its status as a first party title. Both casual and hardcore gamers will likely give Counter-Strike a long look because it'll be a convenient pick-up for both audiences. Casual newcomers will likely recognize the name and won't be intimidated by it now that the game is available on Xbox. The hardest of the hardcore won't have to hop from one gaming rig to another now that they can play CS online over Xbox Live. Nobody, that is not one person, should expect much beyond what they remember from 2000 when Counter-Strike began its roll as one of the most popular PC titles of all time.     Gameplay    Counter-Strike as a franchise began as a free modification of the groundbreaking Half-Life that gave gamers the chance to frag each other with modern day weapons in contemporary locations and situations. On Xbox the same appeal that hooked thousands is still alive and well. Unfortunately, this appeal doesn't include a single player campaign to speak of beyond the endless rounds of ~sparring~ you can do with bots. This makes Counter-Strike on Xbox a one-trick pony more or less since online play over Xbox Live is going to be the greatest reason to buy this game.    Strategy Guide Available! Shoot to Kill!  The most popular PC online game in the world is now on Xbox. Master every map with expert tips and full details on every weapon. Don't get dusted.  Get the Guide | See Other Guides    When we say there's no single player game we mean that there's no story or campaign to motivate your actions. The settings, maps, weapons and gameplay elements are identical whether you're playing online or by yourself. When you're by yourself you'll have bot teammates helping you go to war against bot enemies. Going online you can still mix and match bots in with however many human players you have but on the surface you'll only be able to distinguish online from offline by the quality of individual opponents. If you don't have Xbox Live, you're not going to get much out of Counter-Strike.        The control of Counter-Strike has been suprisingly well-adapted for the console. The speed of the game stays nice and fast and the aiming isn't as jerky as most other PC-to-console shooter ports. It's still not perfect in the way that Halo fit so well with the Xbox, but we were pleasantly surprised at how well the aiming went. Put it this way, at no point did we find ourselves cursing the accuracy of the aiming system and that's definitely a good thing.    When you're actually playing CS, you choose to play as either a terrorist or counter-terrorist operative. The terrorists are often trying to plant bombs or assault hostages in very specific locations on the game map. As a counter-terrorist soldier your job is to stop them either by blasting every terrorist out of his memory or by defusing their bombs or rescuing the hostages in question. This makes the gameplay boil down to a team based free for all where you smoke anybody that's not dressed like you and your teammates, but only if they're holding a gun. Quick reflexes and fast-paced shooter skills are in high demand with CS. It's not quite as frantic and out of control as something like Quake because you're not respawning within seconds of your most recent death, but then it's far from the slower, meticulous pacing of a Tom Clancy themed game. This is one of the areas where Counter-Strike's appeal is undeniable. You can run-and-gun and use conventional squad-based tactics (when you're playing with buddies since the bot command system is laughable) and have success either way. You'll just have to put in the time to perfect your method.    Managing money and ammunition are a couple of important skills to have as well. All of the games are team based with multiple rounds making up a single match. When you begin a match you're given a limited amount of money and short amount of time to shop for the weapons and equipment you want to take into battle. Initially you won't be able to afford anything cool, but as your team strings together victorious rounds you'll find you'll have more cash to spend at the beginning of each round. Buying armor, ammo, powerful primary weapons, grenades and whatnot only makes the strong stronger, but even the losing team will find itself with a little extra cash as the game wears on. It is in this way that CS motivates you to succeed because using a pistol with one clip when the other team is loaded down with shotguns, heavy machine guns and plenty of ammo is extremely frustrating. Veterans of Counter-Strike won't have any problems, but we could see where some newbies might not get the hang of the unintuitive shopping system until an hour or two into the game. Wielding nothing but a knife in the face of danger will motivate you plenty. The shopping options, bot difficulty nearly ever other feature of the game can of course be adjusted to your liking and in the case of Counter-Strike you should visit the option menus repeatedly to tweak the game to your liking.    An Xbox Live subscription might as well be built into the cost of Counter Strike, because if you're not a subscriber you have no business bothering with this game. There's minimal presentation, no true single player game, so you're reliant on the Xbox Live gaming community out there to help you squeeze the fun out of this disc. When you get in a good match with good players, you will experience the joys that online gaming is meant to offer. Just like we saw with Rainbow Six 3, Crimson Skies and MechAssault before it, the online multiplayer aspects of Counter-Strike can be worth the price of admission. The difference with CS is that it has no choice. It had to be great online otherwise there's no point to the game. The design of the levels is very conducive to the types of multiplayer games you're going to be playing. There are all kinds of dead ends, sniping spots, treacherous corridors and other constructions that will make for some splendid multiplayer battles. The developer's focus on multiplayer gaming is clear when you start adding up all the little pieces.        Xbox owners are getting a wealth of maps (18 to start), including some from the upcoming CS: Condition Zero PC game, with more on the way over Xbox Live. When you hop on Xbox Live you have limitations on the number of human players you can run with. Basically you can run ten players total in a ~humans only~ game and that number decreases when you add more bots to the game. However you can add up to eight bots when you keep the number of human players at four or less. When you setup a dedicated server (an increasingly popular feature of Xbox Live titles) those numbers all change for the better so that you can run 16 humans or up to eight humans vs eight bots. A ten human player game can get a little twitchy at time but it's on par with the current generation of other Xbox Live games like Crimson Skies or Rainbow Six 3.        Graphics    This has to be the biggest disappointment. The look of Counter-Strike looks like an upgrade from the PC original but only barely. The bottom line is, bringing one of the most popular online games to the Xbox four years after the fact warrants a significant visual upgrade. Not that there wasn't effort on the part of the developers, but the handful of lighting effects and enhanced textures Ritual Entertainment threw in just aren't enough. We're too late into the Xbox's lifecycle to have first party games, especially high profile ones like Counter-Strike that don't look like Xbox games.    Some of the lighting tricks in Counter-Strike help bridge the gap between 2000 and 2003 while others make that gap more obvious. Going from indoor to outdoor portions of a map will come with a subtle effect that mimics the adjustments your eyes would have to make in that same situation. Then again if the whole game wasn't so bright and washed out looking you might not even notice. When you look at the reflections bouncing off of your weapon as you move around, the game has a hard time throwing shadows and adjusting the amount of shine smoothly. Fancy real-time lighting is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Xbox and Counter-Strike will never be confused with the best looking games on the system. The subtle dilation simulation effect is still a nice touch.    It gets very basic after this, however. If the terrorists and counter-terrorists had any less articulation they'd be as bad as those old school Star Wars action figures from the 1970s where you could only move the arms and legs. As it is they double up so that knees bend as well, but something tells us the only reason good guys and bad guys keep their weapons leveled and at the ready is because transition animations would've been too expensive.     The environments themselves are impressive in their design, but not in their overall look and level of detail. Maps representing locations throughout the world sure make the planet earth look like a boring place. They're very functional with lots of sniping places and treacherous ambush spots but they're just not much to look at. Where we've seen Xbox shooters that would have light streaming in through a blown out roof into an open cathedral just because it looked cool, Counter-Strike put that hole there as another way for terrorist to get the jump on you. It's not there for you to admire and enjoy.         The character models and environments themselves are pretty angular and simple to keep things running smoothly when you get going on Xbox Live. Mission accomplished, but the result is a game that when compared to its closest competitors looks more like SWAT: Global Strike Team than Rainbow Six 3. The graphics don't get in the way of anything Counter-Strike has to offer, it just doesn't live up to the standard that's been set for Xbox in 2003. If this game had come out as a launch title for example, it'd be a different story.     Audio    The most important audio element of Counter-Strike will be the commands and exclamations of your teammates and opposing players whilst battling online. Either that or the custom soundtracks (!) you'll be blasting while you're blasting away at enemies.     The weapon sound effects and voice acting are adequate and don't do anything to make the game better or worse. The surround sound keeps weapons fire and ricochets sounding off from the right directions but there's nothing too fancy going on with the Dolby Digital in Counter-Strike.    Really there isn't much to say about the audio of the game. It's as bare bones as the front end and is purely intended to be functional. The coolest feature by far is the ability to use custom soundtracks while playing offline and over Xbox Live. You can even preset one soundtrack for solo play and pick another soundtrack for your multiplayer games.   Counter-Strike is a decent game if you take it for what it is. However, I couldn't help but feel disappointed that neither Ritual nor Valve nor Microsoft Game Studios seized the opportunity to make the Xbox version of Counter-Strike something more visually impressive and worthy of our attention. As it is, Counter-Strike doesn't offer an online shooter experience like Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Rainbow Six 3 where there are unique styles and gameplay subsystems to keep us interested. It just offers a straight ahead first person shooter that's made it over from PC in better shape than I could've predicted. It's just strange that the game that inspired so many evolutions of the FPS genre is now back again on Xbox competing with so many games of its own legacy. You may have read this before, but Counter-Strike is a lot like Michael Jordan in a Wizards jersey. The greatness of the name is undeniable, but nowadays they're both merely competitive. This game is a must have like a 2002-2003 Jordan trading card.", "date": "Nov 19, 2003"}
