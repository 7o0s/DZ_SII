The game completely fails to live up to the high standard set by the first four N64 releases (Mario, Pilotwings, Wave Race and Gretzky 3D).When you look at the screenshots, you'll quickly notice that the game looks pretty much like the arcade Kombats. Which is fine if we were dealing with a five year old arcade machine -- but what we have here is a Nintendo 64, the hottest home video game machine on the market. And what Williams/Midway gives us is a direct translation of a dated arcade game. It doesn't help much that we get three games in one since the differences between the single installments of the MK series were pretty much cosmetic -- and Midway didn't go back to upgrade the sprites from the earlier installments or really add anything new.The N64 version features no load time, lots of fighters (among them: Kano, Reptile, Mileena, Kung Lao, Shang Tsung, Sindel, Sektor, Stryker, Nightwolf, Sheeva, Kitana, Scorpion, Sonya, Smoke, Rain, Jade, Baraka, Johnny Cage, Ermac, Noob Saibot, Sub-Zero, Kabal, Jax, Rayden, Cyrax, Liu Kang, Motaro and Shao Kahn,) plenty of speech, the same soundtrack and plenty of gore.One of the reasons Mortal Kombats were made with digitized footage of actors was the idea of creating life-like, realistic animation. But on the N64 the player animation is choppy and the flat, rather unexciting backgrounds look like they suffer from a low color palette. A couple of years ago Mortal Kombat Trilogy would have created quite a stir in the gaming scene but now as it stands next to games like Tekken 2, Virtua Fighter 3, the Street Fighters, and Mace, it shows its old age. This is not a question whether 3D fighters are better than 2D fighters. Let's face it, the N64 is better at creating smooth animations using polygons than at prepainted bitmap animation, whether in three or in two dimensions (Street Fighter EX is an example of a 2D fighter with polygon fighters). Apart from compiling three MKs into one cartridge (which must have been difficult, given the limitations) developer Williams did not seem to have put a major effort into creating this game. It looks like a rush job. There is nothing here that reminds you that you're playing an N64 title (the intro graphics are especially painful). I finally got around to looking at the Playstation version and--guess what, it looks better, plays better, has more fighters and is a lot cheaper (unfortunately it's also buggier).Another low point is the sound. When you pop in the game you will have to crank your volume up a lot: Everything sounds muffled and the mixing is way off.Controls are pretty good. You use the control pad to move your character, jump and crouch (it's easier than using the analog stick). The A, B, and C buttons let you punch and kick and perform all kinds of fighting moves. You can also block your opponents' attacks with the L Button or run quickly with R. The C buttons on Nintendo's controller are a little too close together making it more difficult to pull off some of the moves. Purists will probably go for an arcade style joystick like the InterAct Arcade Shark which delivers the same feel as the arcade.A huge game with very little innovation, Mortal Kombat Trilogy proves that a large selection of playable fighters doesn't necessarily make a better game. If you have to play a fighting game on your N64 -- now -- and you have no problem spending $79 bucks on a mediocre game, then go for it. If you are a hopeless Mortal Kombat fan and you don't own any 32-bit version of the game then you probably already picked up a copy anyway and you'll probably like it. Otherwise, I suggest waiting for Killer Instinct, Dual Heroes, Dark Rift and Mace. Recommendation: Only for die-hard MK fans (and only those without a PSX).", "date": "Nov 21, 1996"}
