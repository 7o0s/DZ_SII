This particular genre has a long and respectable history, going back a good fifteen years or so now, but said history hasn't exactly been replete with examples of innovation in game design.  Don't believe me?  Here, then, is a brief history of light-gun games.   In Duck Hunt, things jumped out and you shot them.   In Safari Hunt, things jumped out and you shot them. In Gangster Town (the second level, anyway), things jumped out and you shot them while in a moving vehicle. In BattleClash, things jumped out and you shot them, if you happened to have been dumb enough to buy the Super Scope 6.   In Lethal Enforcers, things jumped out and you shot them.  Meanwhile, Congressmen jumped out and sternly objected.   In Virtua Cop, nifty polygonal things jumped out and you shot them. In Time Crisis, things jumped out, then you jumped out, and you shot them. In House of the Dead, things jumped out and you shot them two or three times. In Elemental Gearbolt, things jumped out and you shot them while soothing music played - which, while pleasant, still wasn't that much of a leap forward.   Indeed, none of the above presented much that was radically different from what came before it.  The pace was quick, the enemies were sluggish, precise aiming wasn't that big of a deal, and in general, the emphasis was on quick, Hard Boiled-style arcade gunfights.  When Silent Scope arrived in arcades a year or so ago, though, it did present something different.  For one, there was the monstrous sniper-rifle controller, equaled only in size and silliness by the massive weapons attached to Gunblade NY and LA Machineguns.  More than that, though, there was the idea behind the game, which was to take you out of the heat of battle and into the calm, removed position of a long-range sharpshooter.  Quickness, as always, was of the essence, but so was precision - much more than any other light-gun game to date, it required that you actually aim.  Silent Scope accomplished this by implementing a combination of two different view modes into the arcade hardware.  Looking out over the rifle, you could see the entire game screen, representing the view through the sniper's unaided eyes.  This allowed you to roughly target enemies, which were outlined Virtua Cop-style with little targeting reticles.  Then, you could look through the scope on the gun controller, which contained at little LCD showing a zoomed-in view of the target area - once you had the enemy in your sights, bang.  The game proved to be great fun, especially thanks to some original sharpshooting challenges and level designs, where you had to pick an enemy off a football field while a game was on, or take out the pilot of a VTOL jet.  But when we heard the news of a home conversion, you can guess what we thought: ~uhm, how's that supposed to work, then?~  The Columbine effect aside, a home version of that giant rifle would be out of the question, given the astronomical expense.  So how has Konami managed to bring the game to a console?  As it turns out, they've done a pretty good job with the control scheme, and the graphical port is arcade perfect (blood effects and all), but what can't be overcome is the fact that this is an arcade game, with an arcade pace, arcade progression, and most of all, arcade length.  With enough change in your pocket, you can pop your way through the original version in under an hour, and while you'll be feeding plenty of quarters into the machine during that time, it's not likely that the damage will add up to the PS2 game's $50 price tag.  Gameplay  The console version of Silent Scope brings the arcade gameplay home by taking the two view modes, superimposing them over each other, and letting you toggle in between the two by pressing and holding a button.  The default view is the over-the-rifle view from the arcade, with just a small crosshairs representing your aiming point.  Once you're in the vicinity of the target, you hold down a button to change the view mode and you're looking through the scope, with a zoomed-in view that you can move around, while the rest of the screen is grayed out.  After a little while, the routine becomes easy to remember, and then it's all up to perfecting your aim.  The trick is to learn how to aim quickly in the longer viewpoint, so you don't have to futz around with your finer aim in the zoomed-in mode.  Luckily, the analog control is smooth and nicely-paced - you won't find yourself overshooting your target because it's too fast, or wishing it would kick up the pace a little bit.    Graphics  Silent Scope didn't run on anything especially powerful in the arcades, so it's come home to PS2 completely intact.  It's still not a showpiece for the system by any means, but it looks clean and moves perfectly smoothly, with good animation on the bad guys' part and some unforgettable visual set-pieces.  When you're drawing down on the pilot of the Harrier jet, the camera swoops and dives through the city skyline, simulating the effect of hanging out the door of a helicopter, and there are some sharp effects off of reflective surfaces like the jet's bubble canopy.  Other scenes are a little more subtly impressive, like a nighttime mission that's illuminated with the grainy green-tinged overlay of low-light amplification equipment.    In general, while the architecture of Silent Scope isn't going to wow anyone with its complexity, it gets the job done, providing a realistic backdrop for what you're really supposed to be paying attention to: the target.  It would have been pointless to spruce this one up for home release - what is done well is done well enough already.  Sound  BANG!  That's the sound you'll hear most often, and as gunshots go, it's a pretty nice one.  Besides that, though, the soundtrack is basically utilitarian, with a few high points in sequences like the Harrier shootout, accompanied as it is by your thumping helicopter blades and your opponent's thundering jet engines.  Every step of the way is tracked by the sound and feel of your heartbeat, though, which is a cool touch in a 2001 sort of way.  Replayability  You knew it was coming - this is where Silent Scope shows its biggest flaws, because sad to say, there just isn't a whole lot of game here.  The six arcade stages add up to a challenge you can shoot your way through in a single sitting, even with the branching missions and difficulty levels.  They're great level designs, by all means, but this is still basically an arcade game, meant to be played for change, not the hefty sum the home version costs.  The extras included in the home version are well-intentioned, but they don't take up much slack.  A series of sniping challenges, where you have to pick off silhouette targets in a variety of testing ranges (all variations on the sort of abandoned farmhouses that the CIA must own thousands of...) is a nice thought, but it doesn't come close to the feeling of the actual missions.  Since you can, why not practice with the game proper? Silent Scope is great fun while it lasts, which in most cases should wind up being as many hours as you can count on your hands.  Konami's made some additions to the home version in a noble effort to add more replay value, but they're still just icing on what I'd estimate to be a medium-sized cupcake.  Unless you're a die-hard fan of the arcade version, obsessed with developing your technique to the fullest, you're going to still be hungry after the three or four bites it took to eat the sucker, and you're also liable to be wondering why you just spent 50 bucks on something you could have made a dozen of with a two-dollar cake mix.Drifted off there for a moment...were we talking about games, or pastry?  What?  Both?  Sorry about that.  To try and salvage something out of a doomed analogy, though, a PS2 game rental can be had for about the same money as a really nice cake mix, and that's a much more reasonable price to pay for the fun you can get out of Silent Scope.  It's a great game for as long as it lasts, so if you live near one of those lucky Blockbusters at launch, this is definitely one you should give a test run.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
