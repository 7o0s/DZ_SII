Sometimes, you get tired of dropping blocks and just want to start digging up treasure for aliens slave drivers named Zeke, you know.  Well, so does THQ, as they have just released Dig It on Verizon's Get It Now service for think-gamers wanting a puzzler of a different variety.  Features: Multiple playing fields Upgrade your digging equipment Race against time  Dig It is really just a visual redressing of Minesweeper, but can you really fault THQ for replicating the masterful puzzler that entrances PC users around the world every day?  In Dig It, you're Jim, a ~shovel enthusiast~ under the command of alien handler Zeke.  Zeke wants to you traverse the planet, digging up treasure for him.  So, replace mines with treasure, or color coding with the numbered squares.  The playing fields aren't exactly huge, so the game isn't very difficult.  Zeke tells you how many treasures he needs you to find on a particular level and turns you loose with your shovel.  You wander around the landscape, keeping an eye on the ever-present clock ticking in the corner.  A color bar on the side of the screen changes hues depending on how close you are to one of the treasures.  When you think you're close, press the action button to start shoveling.  If you miss the treasure, a text box will tell you whether you're hot or cold, or whatever varying degree of temperature you are from the object of Zeke's desire.  And, really, that's all there is to Dig It.  You can unearth shovel upgrades to make the digging process faster, or extra time to put on the clock.  Digging in different terrain takes more time, so if you're in an area with a lot of rocks, the extra time capsules can come in rather handy.  There is zero sound to Dig It, but since this isn't much of an action-packed romp, you don't exactly miss it.  The playing fields are fairly colorful, but the sprites could have definitely been sharper.The instructions call Jim, the hero, ~bald~ and ~pudgy.~  Why hate against the hair-challenged?  Lots of chicks dig dudes with less on top.  After all, it's an excess of testosterone that makes your hair fall out, so isn't a balding guy more attractive and virile than somebody with an over-rated full head of hair?  And, hey, who doesn't like Sean Connery or Kevin Spacey?  (Well, after ~David Gale,~ I don't like Spacey anymore, either.) Oh, the game... it's fun.", "date": "Jun 2, 2003"}
