While it may sound trite to say so, Activision and Sony Music Entertainment produced the most authentic ninja game ever with Tenchu, a game in which stealth, patience, and observation, rare traits in any videogame, pushed your ancient warrior through to the very end.   Two years later, Activision has refined many of the gameplay issues that were so likeable in Tenchu, has added a plethora of new elements, and for all intents and purposes, created an overall more well rounded game with Tenchu II Stealth Assassins. And despite noticeable graphics limitations and some sketchy new elements, Tenchu II is still a remarkable experience.  Story There are some things you can't accuse Tenchu II of being, and that's short, or without a story  two accusations that the first suffered. The combination of in-game graphics and FMV tell the story of the fall of the House of Gohda, the twisted rise of the Burning Dawn, a renegade ninja clan that's gone to the Dark Side, and it's beautifully told with dozens of scenes. While the scenes do wrap each episode with a beginning and ending sequence, there are also scenes that appear before the encounter of each boss, and a different scene depending on whether you win or lose. Then there are the 'inter-scene' scenes (scenes in between each cutscene), which last as long as one to almost two minutes, and which relay the personal stories of Rikimaru, Ayame, and Tatsumaru, but also the politics of the Civil War surrounding the House of Gohda. It's not literature, nor Oscar-winning stuff, and the horrible, terrible, dumbed-down voice acting of the playable characters doesn't help one bit -- but the story, nonetheless, holds its own.   What's more, Rikimaru, Ayame, and Tatsumaru each have different stories to tell. So, if you want the full experience of the game, you need to beat it three times. Given that Rikimaru and Ayame each have 10 missions (11 if you count the Training Mission), and Tatsumaru has seven, players have one long, engrossing story-based game to play. In that way, Tenchu II is much better than its predecessor.  Gameplay What was good in Tenchu is still good in Tenchu II; there is more of what players liked in this prequel, which tells the story of three Azuma Ninjas during civil war in ancient Japan. Whether you choose Rikimaru or Ayame  or after beating the game with each player and selecting Tatsumaru -- each ninja possesses more moves, and a greater scope and reach in battles.   It appears that the developers wizened up after their first success, adding aspects that haven't diluted or ruined the true ninja experience. Whether you choose Ayame, a young rebellious female with twin knives, or the diligent apprentice Rikimaru, with his ninja katana, the object of Tenchu 2 the hasn't changed: use your quiet skills to remain unnoticed, kill quietly, and reach your goal, whether it's to protect the Lord Gohda, assassinate an evil brother or cousin, seek out the evil ninja clan's secret hideout, or rescue villagers.   The newest elements seem like natural extensions of the original. First, more ninja tools, such as Blinding Dust, which temporarily blinds your opponent, or Leaves of Stealth, which enables you to transport from in front of your opponent to behind him, are a damn fine example. Poison darts, mines, and a few others simply complement the existing arsenal. You can pick them off dead enemies, or if you beat the level on the higher rankings, you earn them. The new moves add a greater and deeper fighting experience to what was generally considered a faulty, if not weak, combat system in the first game. Reverse attacks, 45-degree angle attacks, and combos seem to come easier in these fights. There is still a lot of room for improvement, and often I wished Tenchu II had incorporated the combat system introduced in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, because of the many times I was slashed in the back of the head. But alas, Tenchu II took the high road and made things challenging.   The ability to swim in water was a welcomed element at first, but after a few levels of discovering its value, I concluded it a double-edged sword at best. You can now approach your opponent from angles and areas that simply didn't exist before, creating a deeper level of exploration and experimentation. And the actual swimming mechanism is adept stuff  you can paddle on the surface, slowly use a competent breast stroke underwater, or by pressing X quickly, perform a butterfly kick, reminiscent of that used in Super Mario 64. Double tap X to execute a summersault jump out of the water, or press R1 to use the ghost pipe, which enables you to hide from the enemy just below the water's surface while breathing through a reed to replenish your air supply. But despite all of the underwater goodness, which is nice on its own, it's lousy sneakin', and that makes for un-ninja-like obviousness. You literally splash around like a newborn Tasmanian Devil in a matchstick house, and regardless of how quite you try to be, once you hit the water, it makes a [bleep]-load of noise. Playing in one of the later levels, in which you make your way from pontoon to boat to ship by either performing the long jump or swimming, I opted to jump, and was glad for it. Why? Every time I dipped into the water, I lost points because someone, something, or everyone noticed. As guards equipped with burning arrows lurk in the darkness and sharks swim from behind you for a bite to eat, the water becomes a terrible, terrible option.   In regard to the battle system, what you learn in Tenchu and relearn in the sequel, is that fighting an enemy straight on is almost always a mistake, particularly against the later bosses. It may be a fight, but you are a ninja, trained in the art of subtlety and deception, and using every trick in your bag of goodies is appropriate. The enemies use them, too. Running isn't a bad thing, either, especially if you can fix a better angle on an unsuspecting enemy. Magic Dust, Calpers, Smoke Bombs, and Shurikens all come in oh-so-handy against the numerous bosses. Tenchu II consistently rewards gamers for perfecting the art of the ninja, and the fighting system is simply one more good example of how deep the ninja concept runs in this game.   Speaking of bosses, the game is packed with them, and only one do you fight twice. Each level has a boss, and in every new fight, they grow progressively more dangerous, quick, and better equipped with more deadly tools. In fact, I would go so far as to say that some are very difficult indeed. Once you beat them they seem easy (ah, retrospect), but they're really not. That's partly due to the save system itself. At the end of each level players are not given the chance to save prior to fighting a boss. Some hardcore gamers may like it this way  and I found it to be challenging and rewarding  but not all folks will like it. If you lose to the boss, you must begin the level, from the start, over again -- and with less tools than you were previously provided with. So, instead of the game giving you better odds (because you suck), it raises the odds against you (confirming your suckiness even more). Make no doubt about it, though, Tenchu II will make you a better ninja by the time you finish the game.   Along with your increased abilities come smarter enemies. The AI is better because now dead bodies are indeed noticed by sharp-eyed guards, and if they see their dead comrades lying around, you lose points, and perhaps a good amount of health if you're stopped, too. One good way to prevent obvious lumps of dead flesh that give away your position is to pick them up and move them. Yep, by pressing R2 and Circle simultaneously, and standing in the right spot above the enemy's head, you can drag bodies into dark corners where they'll be picked apart by vultures, but they won't ever give your position away. I wish this new ability were as good as its sounds. I can't count how many times I slit some dude's throat and then tried in earnest to grab for his head in the few seconds I had before a guard saw me standing over him looking like an idiot, but couldn't locate the spot to grab. The development team may have made this element difficult to do to add challenge, but I actually believe that it wasn't implemented that well, and so it's awkward and difficult and  just like the swimming  more trouble than it's worth.  Graphics With Tenchu, it's all about weaving in and out of the darkness, being as swift as a cheetah and quietly slicing throats. Several camera angles are used in each stealth kill, and the in-game engine's cut-scenes display a phenomenal amount of blood and gore as you slit enemy after enemy's throat, gorge your sword through their chest, or lop off their head, to the sounds of a last gasp, wimper, or a cut-off breath of air. What's so refreshing, if you can call it that, is that the quite subtlety of the gameplay  the stealth kill -- works to impart the ninja's true essence, and somehow doesn't shove the gore in your face, despite the gallons that are let.   The levels are bigger, and many more of them are outside. This is a great change from the first title, where everything seemed to take place in the dark of night, and so you couldn't see anything, which also conveniently hid the PlayStation's limitations. With Tenchu II, The limited PS technology really shows up. You simply can't fit that many polygons and textures on a screen with so little RAM and so small a pipeline to fit it through, and expect to see that far. So, with these new outside levels, while you can actually see farther than in the first, you can clearly see that you can't see that much, so to speak. Interestingly enough, this very limitation plays into the game's notion of sneaking around and being careful. If you can't see past a certain point because of the fogging, you should walk softly stranger.   As was the case in the first game, the character models are excellent, detailed, and well represented in their choice of traditional clothing, in the anatomically correct display of the human form, and in their human movement. Perhaps, where the environments look kinda rough around the edges, the characters make up for it, and look quite good.   But to be honest, as we reach into the next generation of games, with Dreamcast, and now PlayStation 2, Tenchu II shows off the PlayStation's biggest weaknesses. The perspective correction is just short of horrible, the sprites are obvious and uninspiring, the flame effects on fire are pathetic and there appears to be seams in everything, making the game feel unfinished and fragile. At this point in the life of the PlayStation, we should have something that looks better, or at least smoother, than Tenchu II.  Sound Lots of the same sound effects from the first game are here in Tenchu II, and the ones you'll hear the most are generated from the KI meter. ~What's that?~ ~He must be around here somewhere...~ ~Ugh?~ and ~We're under attack!~ are what you'll hear the most when you're noticed. Other than the weird singing sounds of arrows whizzing through the air, and the gulp of death from a dying enemy, Tenchu II is a quiet game, and it's good that way.   All of the music is traditional Japanese. The music in the first seemed at the time, when Rob Zombie ruled the roost, incredibly daring and original. It was slow, soft, subtle, kinda scary music, because it w the backdrop to so much death and quiet killing. It was perfect. I would have been happy if Activision simply used that same music, in a sort of nostalgic way. Instead of that, the team went ahead and brought in more traditional Japanese music, but most of it is a little louder and obvious. It's more dramatic and thunderous, where the fist game used subtle acoustic music and ancient Japanese instruments to provide an absolutely authentic sound. And because of this louder sound it doesn't have the full impact of the first game's soundtrack. It ain't bad, but I liked the music in the first game better.Tenchu is a breed all its own, and Tenchu II continues the tradition with class and integrity. I had mixed emotions about Tenchu II about three months ago, having heard it was more of the same as the first. I was excited but skeptical. To my relief, this prequel is as much as I could have asked for on the PlayStation. Yes, there are limitations to what a PlayStation can visually show, but it hasn't stopped the gameplay from being pure ninja-stealth goodness. In a way Tenchu and now Tenchu II is a throwback to older, harder games, because it challenges you to play a perfect game, to stay unseen, to achieve total ninja nirvana by getting all stealth kills. Hell, I like hard games, I never use cheats, and when you perform in Tenchu II you are rewarded. If only the addition of swimming was tinkered with a little more. The amount of noise you make despite moving slowly, or carefully, simply isn't worth touching the water at all. On that note, picking up folks and dragging them around could have been made easier, too. As it is, it's finicky and annoying. Certainly, the change from all jet black night levels, as seen in the first game, to outdoor day levels (some occur at night, and some at sunset, also) is a nice addition. Some levels are extremely well designed, too, such as the mountain level of Demon Mountain, the dark trick-and-trap level of The Kansen Caverns, and the last ship-based double level, The Sea Battle. As for the level editor, well, it's clever, and works well, and it continues the goodness of Tenchu forever. It's hard at first to decipher exactly how to use it, but once you play around with wall heights and using the stairs right, it'll make a amateur level builder out of you in now time. What's more, it'll make you appreciate just how good Tenchu II really is.", "date": "Aug 10, 2000"}
