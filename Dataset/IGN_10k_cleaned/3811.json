Unfortunately, some of these stand-alone ~expansions~ have worked more like patches and mission packs. Such was the case with the recently released Disciples II stand-alones, which both frustrated me with their lack of any real additions. Thankfully, the guys at Triumph Studio didn't follow that money humping ploy when they put together Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, the stand-alone expansion and almost sequel to last year's Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne. I say ~almost~ sequel because it's not truly a sequel, uses the same engine and nearly everything from Age of Wonders II, but it can be played on it's own without having to have that first game and adds plenty of goodies, including new races, tons of new units, and a great new tutorial to keep old fans interested.   Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic takes place a bit after Age of Wonders II finished up. After Merlin (the protagonist from II) won the great war and smote down some bad wizards that were giving all of the other fair and good wizards a bad name, things were at peace for a bit. And then the rifts started appearing and Shadow Demons started pouring through the openings. Of course, all of this was blamed on wizards and their magic. Either the wizards actually opened up the gates themselves or the Shadow Demons were attracted to magic... it makes no difference. The world suddenly wanted nothing to do with the wizards that had been battling each other for so long. The small folk had lost their faith and kingdoms were on a massive witch... sorry, wizard hunt to stop all of the demon shenanigans. Too bad for them, that really had nothing to do with it.   Meanwhile, Merlin has been captured and put away in the Shadow World. Only barely does he manage to send a messenger out to tell an Elf wizard Julia that he is trapped. In this message he explains that the Shadow Demons aren't caused by wizards and that those with power must step up and unite to fight the creatures before they overrun the world.   Shadow Magic adds a bunch of new content to an already good game, the first of which most new players will experience right away. The new three stage tutorial, much needed for this fairly complicated game, goes over all of the game's basic in good style. Not only does it introduce the game and story, but it also helps to ground players in very basic strategies. Those new to the game and the genre should finally be able to get started fairly quickly, even if some reference to the manual will still be needed. Thankfully, those that have already played Age of Wonders II can skip the tutorials without having to worry about missing anything really important.   While most of the game mechanics are still the same, there are some different things that need to be learned anyway. The biggest of these things is probably the addition of the Shadow World. This serves as a third level on which the game can be played. In Age of Wonders II, the world was divided into the surface and underground maps, so it shouldn't be too hard to figure out. You can switch between maps easily by clicking on the tag above the mini-map depending on which level you want to view. So in basic, the Shadow World works much like the other two worlds. The difference comes in how your units react to this space. The first thing you should realize is that the Shadow is poison to most of your units reducing their attack, damage, defense, and resistance ratings by 33 percent, making even strong units suddenly weenie. Some units will be natural Shadow Walkers that aren't affected by this, but most of them will need to have the Shadow Walker spell cast on them making them invulnerable to the sickness. The difficulty here is that this spell, while it stays on constantly, will have a mana upkeep cost to it, so sending many units into the Shadow World can be pretty costly to your magic resources. The good thing about this realm is that your units will move double time while they're there. And this really is a good thing since the maps tend to be large and the Shadow is often the last place you travel. Speeding things up at the end is nice.   The game itself at the core is still the same as it has been throughout the series. Most of your moves are made on the three maps above, below, and in shadow. Cities must be built, ruins and other buildings scattered about the map must be explored, units must be built, and battles must be won. The mix between the strategy of the overland maps and the battles themselves is still a great one as well. Battles can be very fun and interesting due to all of the units different abilities and strengths and both sieging and defending cities can be a lot of fun. There's no time limit for moves, so you can really sit and think about what would be your next best move, both in and out of battle. There are a few games like this one such as the Heroes of Might & Magic series, but frankly, I like the style of Age of Wonders more.    When playing the story based campaign mode, you'll be able to begin from two spots. One puts you into the shoes of the Elves, who have the nifty ability to hide their cities in forests now as well as recruit strong treemen, while the other plants you into the worn sandals of one of the new races in the game, the Nomads. These guys are in quite the pickle. Nobody really likes them. In fact, pretty much everybody wants to kill them. Because of this, they've been granted a cool ability that no one else in the game has. They can pack up their city, improvements and all, into a caravan and move it to a new location. While this didn't seem to be really necessary in the trigger driven campaign mode, it can be a very interesting tactic in multiplayer and skirmish games. Add in a lot of fast units that can move long distances, as well as a war elephant especially adept at knocking gates down, and you've got yourself a very balanced and interesting new race.   But really, all of the additions made to Shadow Magic suited me just fine. With the Shadow Demons and Syrons, there're around 50 new units all told, all with different abilities, strengths and weaknesses to take into account. On top of that, there's a bunch of new spells to learn, including very powerful ones that can knock down all of the gates to an enemy city at once. How scary would that be for your enemy?   Still, with all the good stuff, there're still some annoying things that keep this from being a perfect gaming experience. First off, as colorful and lovely as the maps are, it can still be really hard to see all of the units on the screen. Sometimes you just miss the enemies wandering through the forests of your realm. The same thing goes for units in the battle portion of the game. While things eventually sort themselves out, actually finding all of the enemies on screen can be a pain when they're blocked by trees or your own big units. It still annoys me that enemy armies can just wander through your city as well. I still think they should have to stop and attack if they pass too near. It's so frustrating to see enemies just run through your city towards a new defenseless outpost that really should be safe in the middle of your territory. Finally, the computer is an idiot when fighting quick battles for you. Instead of being a convenient way for your 16 powerful units to finish off four average enemy units without any losses (as it should be) half the time the computer ends up losing at least one unit for you. What the hell? If I had run those same battles, I never would have lost a unit. Lame.   My biggest complaint and maybe it's because I'm an idiot, but for once I doubt it, is that you can't explore a map without some serious penalties. In most turn based strategies games I play, the first thing I do is send a unit out to see what's going on. Intelligence is king, right? Every time I did that in this game, I set off some trigger that sent one of the enemy wizards ballistic before I had any real defense prepared. Having Orcs send in big burly units through my gold mines, meaning along with being ill prepared I was also broke, before I had founded even one more city was ridiculous. After playing again and moving slowly without sending scouts out, the level was much easier and manageable. The same thing happened in other maps to different degrees. Now I like a challenge, but making it so that sending scouts out is a bad idea for success seems a bit strange to me.No, Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic isn't radically different from Age of Wonders II. It's still the same game with the same style of gameplay. For that matter, its still pretty much like the original Age of Wonders. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun. I still like this franchise a whole lot, even if it is similar to many of the other ones and I think it's plenty worthy of a look.  There's lots of new stuff to play with, many new units, many new spells, plenty of campaign scenarios, single scenarios, and a random map generator that actually works like it's supposed to. If you're still looking for something really different, look elsewhere, but if you're a turn-based strategy fan, especially of those games in the fantasy genre, you shouldn't be disappointed with Triumph's latest.", "date": "Jul 31, 2003"}
