{"name": "The Sims 2: Nightlife", "name_review": "The Sims 2 Nightlife", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/13/the-sims-2-nightlife", "text": "One of the challenges the team at Maxis is being asked to make good on is EA's schedule of delivering a new expansion pack for The Sims 2 every six months or so. There's obviously a lot of ideas coming from the team as they consistently delivered with mostly decent to good new content in The Sims. It's pretty obvious they hope to continue the streak with this sequel. The first expansion pack, University, brought a huge addition to the experience by adding an extra ~young adult~ life segment for the sims you choose to send to college. Not only did it open up some new gameplay ideas, but also gave players more time with their sims. Their latest expansion, Nightlife, adds more items, gameplay, and animations to the core game. It's a nice addition, especially for those that want to be able to get out on the town and experience more of the sim social life instead of the sim home life. It doesn't seem as huge as University did, but those Sims addicts out there will have some new additions to look forward to that could warrant a purchase.   Every Sims expansion that's ever been released has had a theme. In the case of Nightlife, it's all about Sims getting out of the house and experiencing the fun of city social activities. In this way, Nightlife definitely succeeds. Along with the new dating mini-game (which I'll get into more in a second) Maxis has included a large number of new destinations in the new downtown area including dance clubs, shops, restaurants, lounges, bowling alleys, and parks. While a lot of the areas overlap in purpose, they all make use of different themes and sometimes clever architecture and design to keep the similarities to a minimum.     Getting sims into the swing of the social scene has become easy thanks to new features like the ability to ask other sims questions about themselves, the ability to ~scope~ out a room, go out on outings in groups, and date. All of these things provide a much more active feel to the game than the core product, which focused more on building and interacting within a house. Dates and outings in particular are more active for the player and are very comparable to the Greek Rush mini-game from the University expansion. Each date or group outing starts out by inviting someone or a group of people into the experience. From there, it's a matter of keeping those people entertained and excited to be out.   Dating is probably the most important addition to many players. It allows sims to really spend time with each other in a more private setting while opening up new actions like asking ~What do you want?~ which will allow the other sim to let you know what will make them happier. The answer could be anything from wanting to eat out with your sim or woohoo it up back at your place. This isn't just an normal date though, it's under the baleful gaze of the clock. When the date starts, you'll have a certain amount of time to raise the date rating to the next level which will add on more time. The goal, of course, is to end up with the highest rating possible. If that happens, there's a pretty good chance your sim will be a happy camper by the end of the night. Like I said, it makes the experience much more pro-active on the player's part, which for some will be awesome. For others, it'll be less awesome.     Making things even easier for potential relations is the idea of ~chemistry~ which has been added to help your sims find that special someone quickly. It's a nice touch that allows you to focus energy on the sims that will be easier to get to know, especially romantically, even going so far as to point out which actions will have a greater effect on the relationship with a lightning bolt. It had been frustrating in the past wasting time talking to sims where there was simply nothing going on. Along those same lines, sims will have a better time finding someone interesting with the ~scope the room~ action which will pop up a little dialogue box showing who your sim thinks is the bees knees. Finally, sims will have to contend with turn-ons and turn-offs, which in sound great on paper, but in practice just tend to confuse the issue more. It's hard to remember what your own sims like and some of the time potential dates will refuse to tell you theirs.    As of the time of this review, my sims have had a lot of success dating including some very disturbing woohoos between some of my, um less than attractive sims. It seems pretty hard to really screw up a date as long as you ask that person what it is they want and then do it. I'm not saying the date will go perfectly, but I have yet to see any water thrown in the face of another sim. You pretty much have to make an effort on your sim's behalf to screw a date up. In any case, if things go well, chances are that sim will be up for another go around and will probably be more receptive to more aggressive advances since the relationship will most likely be stronger already.   As you might imagine, keeping a group entertained is a bit more difficult than going out on a date. Much of the success of a group outing really depends on the personalities or relationships between the other members. If you have a couple of guys that are going to fight the whole time, that might bury the fun. But if you have a group that all gets along, likes to go out and have a good time, and will participate happily in group activities like bowling, dancing, and group dinners, it's a terrific way to increase the friendship quotient with those people.   The strange thing about group behavior is that sims new to the neighborhood will get random calls from sims they don't know to come out with them downtown. I guess that's an easy way to get to know a few sims quickly, but I think I would probably find it fairly bizarre in real life if I moved to some other city, didn't know anyone, and had some random Joe give me a ring and invite me out with a group.      Regardless of social oddities, the guys that are working on The Sims 2 franchise have already demonstrated the know how to provide new personality to an already fun filled experience with University. Nightlife is no exception. New animations that come with actions and item interaction are fantastic. My favorite is probably the dance sphere (which you'll find available for purchase as well as in many of the new downtown areas) which not only provides some fun for your sims but also helps increase body stats. Give one of your sims with a low body ranking a whirl in the sphere and you'll see one of the funnier animations in the game at this point. On top of that, sims will now have to contend with vampires in the downtown areas looking to add to their ranks (though the Count hasn't found my sims attractive enough to turn) and have the added help of a gypsy who can provide an instant date for a price (spend money to get the goods, just like with the Ressurectinomitron) .   On top of the gameplay elements are several new item additions as well. DJ and picture booths provide good entertainment, new art and furniture make houses more fun, poker tables and bowling alleys provide sport and gambling, while cars (yes finally there are cars) give your sims the chance to cruise for fun or head out on the town without worrying about a taxi. All of the additions are certainly welcome and help to make your house a more interesting place. Thankfully, sims can now put items in their personal inventories. Taking career rewards from house to house, should you move, is easy as pie. Right now, one of my sims has a computer, hot tub, couch, lamp, TV, chess board, column, treadmill, and car in his personal inventory and there seems to be no end to his deep pockets. This is an addition that's particularly welcome.   Finally, players can give their sims a new aspiration in life, the Pleasure Seeker. These guys want nothing more than to have fun. The more active they are, the more successful they'll probably be. Honestly, it's my least favorite part of the game. I didn't find that it really provided anything particularly exciting or new to play with. The more interesting addition for aspirations is the new ReNuYuSenso Orb reward which allows players to change their life's aspiration. This can potentially throw everything for a loop and provide fodder for your own fun neighborhood storylines.    Nightlife is certainly worth the money if you're the kind of player that loves the social aspect more than the house aspect of the game, but it's doesn't seem as dense an addition as University was. Nevertheless, if you're a sims fan, most additions are welcome, and unless your sim household is super rich (so that you can afford to place all the new things in your house) the huge new downtown area will provide all sorts of fun new things for your sims to experience.I'm pretty curious to see exactly how long Maxis can keep up the six-month expansion pace. More importantly, how long they can pump out expansions with creative ideas? If Nightlife is any indication, we're in store for a list of good expansions.", "date": "Sep 13, 2005"}
