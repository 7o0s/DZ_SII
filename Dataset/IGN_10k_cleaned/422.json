If gameplay is exceptionally solid, the occasional dodgy seam or chunky tree can be forgiven. Case in point: Cool Boarders is so fun, the simple polygon characters tend to get overlooked in the face of the awesome physics. Unfortunately, TNN Motor Sports Hardcore 4X4, besides having an unnecessarily long name, fails on both counts.   Hardcore 4X4 is your basic racing game, souped up with big off-road trucks and bumpy roads. The courses range from forests to snow-covered mountains, with varying weather conditions to increase the difficulty level. All the ingredients are here to make a satisfying game, but Hardcore 4X4 misses the mark on quite a few major points.   To begin with, the graphics are just plain poor. The courses, while 3D and textured, are incredibly grainy, so much so that it becomes hard to look at after awhile. Not a good thing in a game. In addition, the pixellated ~gravel~ that gets kicked up behind your truck in some courses looks like big sheets of paper coming at you.   The other major problem with the tracks is they're frustratingly narrow. Although you're driving what appears to be an off-road vehicle, your truck isn't allowed to venture beyond the sharp boundaries of the trench. Often times it's hard to tell where the road's boundary ends, as it's usually the same color as the road itself. The addition of varying weather conditions, such as rain and snow, just serve to obscure the tracks even more.   Hardcore 4X4 isn't all bad, however. The trucks themselves handle very well, considering the narrow trenches, and the physics of the jumps and bumps are very nice. You can also fine tune your steering from loose to tight, depending on your driving style.   No matter how well the trucks handle though, it doesn't do you any good if you can't see the track. A shame.", "date": "Jan 4, 1997"}
