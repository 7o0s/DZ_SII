On the golf front, players had the included Wii Sports Golf, Tiger Woods shortly thereafter, and Tecmo's own Super Swing Golf, a casual-friendly chibi skins game based off the Korean hit PangYa.  On its way over to Wii, however, there were a few things left to be desired with Super Swing Golf, as the game was slightly more expensive than the original price of free in Korea, and the online community elements  the core of the game  were nowhere to be found.  It was obvious from the get-go that Super Swing Golf and PangYa would have very little in common; at least for the first year of Wii's life.   Super Swing Golf: Season 2 has now arrived, and while the game still has the same general appeal, another year seems to be going by without the online PangYa experience.  Instead, Tecmo updates the game this year with a few new characters, an updated Tour Mode  a semi-linear overworld map that displays events - to replace the Story Mode from the previous game, two new multiplayer games that are now bundled with Balloon Pop in Party Mode, and of course new costumes, items, and a couple courses.  Tour Mode is the biggest change this year.  Basically it's the same story feel, teamed with a non-linear event map.  Is it enough to warrant a purchase though?  If you've got the original already, and aren't already skipping this review to go break down the doors of your local game store, most likely not.  Instead, Super Swing Golf: Season 2 is taking the same role as Tiger Woods 08 did on Wii, replacing the previous year's experience with one that is nearly identical, but offers a bit more content on top of the launch design.  The game's developer boasts improved load times and better A.I., and for the most part we agree (although there's a ridiculous amount of pre-game loading that happens during character selection customization), but for most players that won't be enough.   Of course if you're on the other side of the fence, and never picked up the original game back in December of 2006, you made a wise choice.  The IR camera control from the original game  spotty at best  has been replaced with a traditional d-pad/button layout.  The new equipment also makes for some more casual-centric play, as the Lucky club-set (available from the start of the game) will result in a perfect ~Pangya~ shot every swing, so you can take on even the tiniest of infants and get your butt kicked on the back nine.  As you'd expect, this clubset can be used during single player game types, as well as any multiplayer modes as well.    As for the rest of the package, don't expect too much to change from the original game, as not much has.  There's still no online, the game still runs in 4:3 (though supports 480p), and despite everything it's still a solid game of golf.  Special shots and collectable Pang  the currency of Super Swing Golf  up the game's arcade appeal, and the new levels add new weather conditions to work through, while keeping the core design the same.  It's a bit of a downer that only three new courses were added to the game though, and just like all the animation, music, and sound design, you're quickly going to get dj vu when popping Season 2 in.  It's a small upgrade from the first game; nothing more, nothing less.  What that also means though, is that Super Swing Golf: Season 2 is still the best overall golf experience you can find on Wii.  Swing control tracks well, theres a ton of accessories, a splash of throwback Tecmo characters (including the legendary Ryu Hayabusa), and a fun core game.  Aside from the new additions content-wise the game looks, plays, and feels just like the original did.  The lack of both widescreen display and online support  especially when considering PangYas roots in Korea, as far as online is concerned  is extremely disappointing, and while the game plays great, theres no denying it is lacking true greatness in more than one department.  Hopefully when We Love Golf (Camelots new Wii-exclusive golf game that, by the way, looks nearly identical to Super Swings design) launches later this year well see a competitive spark ignited in the Super Swing Series.  Its still extremely fun, but it needs a kick in the ass if its going to grow from what it started as over a year ago during Wiis launch.  If youre new to the series, Super Swing Golf: Season 2 is the version to get hands-down, as it offers the same experience with additional content.  For those that backed the original, however, $40 is a lot to ask for a few new courses and items.", "date": "Jan 8, 2008"}
