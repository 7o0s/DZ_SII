This happens every now and again, but for this one, editors from the other sites even joined into the fray for some out of control battles with thousands of troops battling on the field at once. I am, of course, talking about Shogun: Total War. This game brought a whole new look and level of depth to the tactical battle field as well as a immersive and addictive turn based strategic element that gave you the power to build, enhance, train, and conquer the lands of feudal Japan. And now, after what seemed like a long wait, the game is back with an expansion called the Mongol Invasion. The title probably tips you off to the theme here, but if you can't figure it out, the expansion deals with the historical fiction that asks the question, ~What would have ensued if Kublai Khan's hordes weren't destroyed on the sea by the storm known as the divine wind?~  The answer: a crapload of fun! Let's just get to the gist of it here, this is a good expansion pack. Creative Assembly has managed to throw plenty of good stuff in here to keep any fans of the original interested in playing more while fixing some of the minor problems and balancing things like enemy AI out a little bit more so that enemy actions on the battlefield are smarter and more challenging while remaining pretty fair overall.   So the biggest draw of the expansion is undoubtedly the new faction that makes its way into the game. The Mongols were a force to be reckoned with back in the 13th century. Having conquered close to all of Asia, the Kublai Khan turned his attention to a large island off the east coast of his domain called Japan. As history goes, Kublai sent his troops over to start a full scale invasion of the country, but his fleet ran into some unseasonably bad weather on the trip across. They had to return to their home country while losing a good portion of the fleet. The invasion was never attempted again.  But now no storm is going to stop the invasion. That little piece of history has been conveniently wiped off of the map by The Creative Assembly in the name of strategy gaming. In The Mongol Invasion, the storm never happened and the Mongols successfully land on the shores of the province of Chikuzen with reinforcements on the way. It's up to you to prove that if that storm didn't wipe out the fleet, the history of the world could have been changed in a rather large way with the destruction of Japan.  With this new campaign, you get to choose either the side of the Mongols or the side of clan Hojo, the regents of Japan at the time of the invasion. Both sides of the campaign bring their own challenges to the table and neither are very easy. Unless of course you play on easy. Wuss. As the Mongols, you'll have a bunch of really fantastic new troops to take advantage of that can inflict a great amount of damage. The challenge here lies with the fact that you won't be able to conscript new troops or construct new buildings with which to fight the Japanese. You'll have to rely on the troops given to you by Kublai Khan. In order for him to send reinforcements, you're going to have to prove to him that you're making some sort of progress. Capture territory and send back some Koku (the currency of the time) so that he can see the spoils. Every now and again, you'll get a notice and see some new troops arrive in various provinces, which forces you to make some choices about where to send those newly arrived troops. Do you want to leave them to defend their newly conquered territory where they may be a little more likely to succumb to greater forces by themselves, or do you abandon that in favor of trying to reach the relative safety of the rest of the hordes? As the Hojo, you'll soon find yourself under some serious pressure from the enemy and in the midst of some hopeless battles. Retreat will be necessary at times to prepare for a greater defense and eventually a counter attack to regain lost land and honor.  As I said, the Mongols come along with a bunch of new units, but the main brunt of their force comes in their cavalry. The speed and ferocity of these troops managed to scare the crap out of everyone that stood in their way and would probably have done a pretty good job of that in Japan as well. There are two types of cavalry you'll get with the Mongols. The first is the light. These guys double as archers and warriors. They're agility made them great for hit and run attacks on enemy infantry and it works just as it should in the actual game. Harassing enemy troops in this fashion only to watch them run after you in a hopeless chase only to have the process repeated is quite a bit of fun. Once you've worn the enemy down with some harrying attacks, you can send in the heavy cavalry who is the most powerful you'll see. They mow the enemy with a startling efficiency providing you aren't running headlong into a contingent of spears. It's best to harass the enemy with some of your other dangerous troops such as the spear throwing Korean Skirmishers, or pyrotechnic Thunder-Bombers. Both of these units do a hell of a lot of damage to the enemy but have close to no skills fighting hand to hand. Back them up with Korean Spearmen and Guardsmen however and you have a lethal fighting force that can take on the toughest opponent.  The Japanese aren't without their own new and powerful units however. First up are the Kensai, which you will definitely want to kill as quickly as possible. These monster ~sword saints~ will chop your itty bitty people to bits. They appear bigger than the average unit on the field and can cut through quite a few units by themselves even though they come in very small numbers, sometimes even just one. Stealthy battlefield ninja, quick and powerful Naginta Cavalry and Ashigaru Crossbowmen fill out the rest of the ranks nicely and add quite a bit more planning to your encounters. Whatever side you play, the units have been excellently balanced to create some more massive battles that have to be seen to be believed.   Along with the Mongol Invasion campaign come three new campaigns that check out the major battles in three of the most important daimyo of the time who also happen to be the three guys that finally united Japan. Along side those are a historical fiction campaign of what might have been important battles on the Mongols' way to conquering Japan. These campaigns are just about the tactical real time battles. They've already been set up for you, its your job to see them through. They're fun and can be pretty challenging. There's a good chance you'll need to play through some of the battles a couple of times before you do things right.  New maps and modes also make their way into the multiplayer function of the game for even more battling fun. Multiplayer battles are definitely a big draw for Shogun. Tactics and strategy often change on the fly for some very interesting situations, especially when you have more than a couple of people commanding armies at once. The new modes offer some new gameplay that should intrigue veterans of the series. Add these along with a new easy to use map editor and you've got hours and hours of extra fun to get into.  So my recommendation to all that have the original Shogun and enjoyed it (which really should be all of you) is to log onto EA.com and buy the Mongol Invasion expansion pack for $15.99. Unfortunately, that's the only place you'll be able to get the expansion pack by itself here in the States. If you don't have the original Shogun yet, go out immediately and buy the Shogun Total War: Warlord Edition. It contains the original and the expansion together in one so you can get all of the goodness in one tight package plus all of the bugs that hampered the original campaign mode have been fixed for an incredibly smooth ride. There's enough gaming here to keep you busy for quite a while.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
