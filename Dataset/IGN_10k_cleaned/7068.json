Flashy combos, four million sub-modes, and a character list longer than you're typical Vegeta ~power-up~ sequence isn't essential. What really matters when developing an effective combat title, is a solid balance between opponents and an actual need for strategy. Presentation, while still important, is only secondary.   Obviously, that's the thinking behind Atari's Super Dragon Ball Z -- a PlayStation 2 port of an arcade game built for fighting fans rather than franchise followers. Developed by upstart studio Craft & Meister (headed by ex-Street Fighter Alpha producer, Noritaka Funamizu), Super DBZ definitely isn't the funhouse ride that Atari's Budokai and Tenkaichi series is. Instead, it's a barebones slugger with an emphasis on kicking Saiyan monkey butt and little else.     Because of the producer's history with fighters (which also includes Rival Schools and Marvel vs. Capcom), Super DBZ is more traditional by design. ~Dial-A-Combos,~ like those of Killer Instinct or Mortal Kombat, have replaced the long-distance super-powered beam struggles of Atari's other sluggers. The result is a much closer, ~in your face~ type of experience and because of this the matches are quicker, more technical, and less airborne when compared to other DBZ equivalents.   For the most part, there's a lot of strong fighting action to uncover. Of the 18 available characters (12 from the arcade, six added specifically for the home version), there aren't any noticeable dominant personalities. That's not to say that some characters aren't more intuitive than others (Goku and Gohan, for instance, are certainly easier to pick up than the Androids), but it isn't anything that a few practice bouts won't remedy. Large, moderately destructible environments, easy-to-execute super moves, and a familiar ~fireball~ gameplay system also lend themselves well to the action.    Character customization, perhaps Super DBZ's most interesting feature, has also been included in the package. Though gamers won't be able to build their own original character from the ground up, they can certainly come close. Using one of the existing fighters as a base model, users can gain experience points and spend them on new skills. Moreover, collecting all seven Dragon Balls and summoning Shenron grants special wishes that can do everything from change the color of an outfit to adding the attack of a rival to your own arsenal. As far as we can tell, he can't summon women's underpants, though.   Like most fighters, Super Dragon Ball Z's main strength is with its two-player experience rather than single-player. Above anything else, this is actually the game's biggest disadvantage compared to the Tenkaichi series, as that franchise has a much more robust list of options. Other than the standard versus and arcade matches, the only other thing to do in SDBZ is compete in Z Survival or Practice. That's a far cry from Budokai's adventure modes, capsule collections, and tournament builders. But again, this simplistic approach is by design not oversight.    Where Super Dragon Ball Z does make its mistake, however, is with its failure to ~go all the way.~ Fast and tactical as the game may be, it doesn't feel as polished or as deep as other close-quarters fighters in the genre (frankly, there just aren't anywhere near the number of moves here compared to most in its category). Counters and reversals, while possible, are seriously underused and there are strange collision detection issues when fighting too close to obstacles (or when on different elevation levels). That creates problems. Don't be taken aback if you find yourself ~stuck~ below or above an opponent every couple of matches or so, only to have your foe nail you with a cheap retaliation even through you can't strike them back.   Visually, the game is a bit of a disappointment as well. Because Super DBZ is based on the manga rather than the anime, its colors and animations are more subdued than what has been established in the typical Dragon Ball Z game. Also, since Craft & Meister's focus is close-up combat instead of theatrics, the over-the-top super moves are almost completely non-existent. Yes, there are elaborate ultra attacks to watch and exploit, but compared to the Budokai series, they're rather tame. On the plus side, there is a fair bit of destructibility to the nicely-detailed stages, while the load times and interface isn't bad at all.    One welcome touch that deserves to be mentioned is that, while geared towards two-player gaming, Super DBZ's AI provides a solid challenge on the ~Normal~ difficulty settings and above. The computer doesn't fall for or into the same patterns one after another, and this means that your CPU opponents beyond the first match (every fighter needs a ~gimme~ round, yes?) will require skill, not luck, to defeat. That's good news. Even so, human vs. human combat is still where the majority of your fun hangs out.While not the amalgamation of Street Fighter and Goku that the pre-release hype would have you believe, Super Dragon Ball Z is still a solid fighter. Designed to appeal to traditional fighting fans before anime nuts, its strengths lay more to the thinking player's side of things rather than the casual. Had it boasted a larger move set and perhaps a few more playable characters, then its value as a long-term tournament title might have been higher. Still, Super DBZ isn't a bad day at the fights for a first-time effort in the least, and it'll be interesting to see what Craft & Meister can come up with next.", "date": "Jul 19, 2006"}
