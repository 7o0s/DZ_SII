The Dawn of Destiny", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/01/yu-gi-oh-the-dawn-of-destiny", "text": "is the first version of the popular card game to appear on Xbox. While the game has made numerous appearances on the Game Boy Advance, this is the first version of the game on Microsoft's big black box. Get ready, because this game features Yu-Gi-Oh! card dueling action and... well, actually that is a complete list of its features. Fans may want to stick to their decks. Read on to find out why.     Gameplay  Never played the game, watched the show, or read the comic book? Here is a small update on the Yu-Gi-Oh! craze. It's a card battle game similar to Magic: The Gathering or Pokemon. Players organize a deck of monsters, traps, and magic attacks then challenge another player's decks in a duel. Each player takes turns putting down a single card in an offensive or defensive position as well as any magic or trap cards. There are also flip effect cards that can force the opponent to attack the set card and activate its abilities. Undefended or partially defended attacks will result in the loss of hit points that each player is allotted at the beginning of the match. The match is completed when one player loses all of their points. As I have learned from the cartoon, it is also necessary to loudly announce each monster card as it's summoned. Then, proceed to taunt your opponents as being week pathetic fools who will spend the rest of their embarrassing lives reliving a crushing defeat at your hands.      There are over 1,000 cards in Dawn of Destiny, many of which have their own unique effects. What seems like a simple card game actually involves some heavy strategy as a player's deck and understanding of the rules increases. For example, monsters can be fortified with spell cards, attacks can be countered with trap cards, and certain cards can be fused together to create super monsters. Cards can be played that will allow one player to see the hidden cards that have been drawn by their adversary. This information can act as a tremendous advantage with placing cards in either attack or defend position. That brings me to an important point about Dawn of Destiny: there is no in-game tutorial. First time players will want to keep the game manual open for their first matches until they catch on to the rules of the game. Luckily, the manual is very helpful with a full description of the rules, different cards, and in-game events. In Fact the Dawn of Destiny manual may have more content than the game.      Dawn of Destiny is a straight up interpretation of the card game for the Xbox. There are no RPG features or story lines, just battles with the same rules and game play of the trading card game. However, there are a whopping two options for how one can go about these battles. In single player mode there is a single duel and triple duel feature.  This refers to how many opponents the player will face in a row with a set number of hit points. Winning a card battle will unlock more challenging opponents and reward the player with stronger cards. The different computer controlled players have only slightly different methods of playing the game. As in the cartoon, some players tauntingly assemble more powerful combination monsters instead of playing a straightforward game of constant attacks.    With no Xbox Live support the million-dollar question becomes: What makes playing Yu-Gi-Oh! on Xbox better than using an actual deck? Well, the game does include over one thousands cards. I'm not sure what the cost of an actual deck of one thousand cards would be, but after tooling around on Ebay I think it might be somewhere in the range of One Zillion dollars. Just keep in mind that these cards cannot be used to play against people without two copies of the game and two systems. There are the three real life promotional card inserts included with the game. These cards are Widespread Ruin, Dark Sage, and the rare Egyptian Gold Card: The Winged Dragon of Ra. It should be noted that while the last card is highly sought after, it cannot be legally used in duel. This may be an incentive for some people to buy the Xbox game, but it occurs to me that it is actually more of a reason to stick with the real life version of the deck.     The lack of multiplayer options is the nail in the coffin for this game. Split screen mode is out of the question considering that the each player keeps a portion of their hand unknown to their competitor. Therefor, the multiplayer option only includes system link. The real loss here is that there is no Xbox Live support. Playing against Yu-Gi-Oh! enthusiasts from around the world with quality player rankings would have been a blast. Imagine downloading new cards, or limited release cards on Live that would lead to online trading. Considering the fan base of the cartoon show and card game this could have been a huge phenomenon.      Graphics  If you would like a complete summation of the graphics in Yu-Gi-Oh! just take a look at the screen shots on the back of the box. The game does have some attractive menus and stock illustrations of characters from the series. Battles feature 3D versions of the dueling monsters and spells trigger some simple background effects. The monsters do not actually fight, they simply appear opposite each other on the screen and the loser is zapped out of existence. This is unfortunate, considering that part of the attraction of the cartoon is watching the animated monsters actually fight after they are summoned. The background can be changed from the main menu, not that any of them are very interesting. Considering this is a card game, it makes little difference to the game play whether the monsters are fully animated in 3D or only appear on face of the card. However, I'd like to think that when a game appears on the most graphically powerful console on the market there would be some indication that it was developed within the past five years.     Sound  As with other areas of the game, the minimalist trend continues with sound. The background tunes are synthesized orchestral elevator music. You are going to want to turn this off as soon as possible. It's a shame there is no custom soundtrack support, especially considering the repetitive nature of the game.  My personal favorite Yu-Gi-Oh! replacement background music includes Brahms, Vivaldi, and Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet. There are card noises as the deck is dealt to the players and minimal sound effects during battle animations. Every so often during a match the AI opponent will respond to a trap or spell card being played. This would be a nice place for a character voice over instead of a text display, but hey, maybe I'm asking too much.        As a card game Yu-Gi-Oh! has a satisfying combination of strategy, luck, and deck building. As for its appearance on the Xbox, I cannot help wondering what the point is. With only system Link available for multiplayer action this is more of a Yu-Gi-Oh! solitaire solution. Even the GBA versions of this game that lack RPG features have the advantage of being portable. Besides the graphical representation of the monsters during battle this game offers nothing over the actual card game.", "date": "Apr 1, 2004"}
