You may recognize such franchises as ATV Offroad Fury, Splashdown or Motocross Madness. While THQ was having decent success with its MX Supercross games, it was looking for a fresh start to its motocross lineup with Rainbow Studios.   For the record, if Rainbow Studios hadn't been snatched up by THQ, MX Unleashed would undoubtedly have been called Motocross Madness 3. This game is everything that the past games in the Motocross Madness series have been and then some. It's also a completely fresh start for THQ's MX franchise, and quite a good one at that.   MX Unleashed, as far as basic design goes, is not unlike any other motocross game you've ever played. You want to come in first when you're racing and score a lot of points when freestyling. Unless you've got serious problems, you can figure this stuff out without reading the manual.   But where this game shines is in execution. Everything is tuned to near perfection. The career mode, while not exhausting, lets you choose your own play style. The trick system is fairly basic, yet showing your stuff feels fluid and natural. The physics are top-notch, and best of all, the controls are tighter than your belt after a Thanksgiving feast. Mmm.... turkey and wine...   Gameplay  What's absolutely excellent about MX Unleashed is its control and physics system, which go hand-in-hand. The responsiveness of the controls is dead-on. The turning radius is tight and quick, tricks are responsive and your rider just does whatever you tell him to, as long as the environment and gravity agrees with you. Everything just feels right.   The physics system is what really makes riding the bikes feel great, though. Your speed, angle of your bike and how you're balancing your weight all affect how your bike responds to the terrain. While this sounds obvious, it's in the subtly and ~touch~, for lack of a better word, that makes controlling the bikes feel natural and responsive. It's quite obvious that Rainbow Studios has been doing this sort of thing for a while, as only experience can lend itself to polish and fine tuning like this.     As with many other motocross games, you're able to preload jumps, which means leaning back on the shocks to put pressure on them, then releasing at the top of a jump to give you more height. This is critical to taking jumps correctly and learning when and when not to preload is essential to winning races. Fully releasing a preload will give you the most height, and you can skip a hill or two sometimes this way, but incorrectly doing so could land you on the incline of another jump, slowing you to a crawl, or even worse, resulting in a beautifully horrific wipeout.   There's quite a bit of subtlety and play in this, as you can choose to unload only a small bit or all of your loaded shocks from a jump. You'll need to take into consideration your speed, what's ahead of you and where you want to land when launching. While this sounds somewhat basic, you have enough control over all this that practicing your runs and really learning any given track can pay off greatly.   MX Unleashed's trick system is rather simplistic as far as execution is concerned. Pressing any of the three trick buttons or any combination thereof, plus a direction on the analog or directional pad, will perform a given trick. Keeping the buttons pressed will hold the trick as you'd assume; pretty basic stuff. The game uses a multiplier trick system, meaning that the number of tricks you perform becomes the multiple of the trick total, such as in any of the Tony Hawk games or anything similar. For example, performing four tricks for 3,000 points will net you 12,000 total points (4 x 3,000). You're also able to perform backflips, which adds to both your point total and multiplier, while still letting you perform any other trick simultaneously for huge scores. You're also likely to land on your melon doing this, which is always painfully funny. Sadly, you cannot be decapitated.    Aside from the airborne tricks, you can perform a couple ground-based tricks as well, namely a wheelie or stoppie. A wheelie is obviously balancing on your back tire, and a stoppie is balancing on the front. The easiest way to perform a wheelie is to hold in the clutch, lean back, give the bike some gas and release the clutch. A stoppie is performed by braking and leaning forward while traveling at reasonably high speeds.   What's new to this game though is the ability to land in either a wheelie or stoppie, which will extend your trick combo. It can be difficult to pull off either of these maneuvers, but doing so will not only net you more points, but also another multiplier. In addition, you can also land in a no-hander, one of the more basic airborne tricks you can perform. This will give you a similar point boost, but with the same landing risk involved. The good part about this is that you can perform a no-hander as the last trick in of your in-flight combo and you don't necessarily have to stop the trick when you're ready to land, only if you don't want to risk killing yourself.   Not only can these moves help you gain more points from a singular jump, but you can use them going into a second jump, which can really extend your score. Doing something like this is pretty damn difficult, but if you can find the proper place to pull it off, more power to you. If you land any of these incorrectly though, you'll be soaking your toilet paper in peroxide.   The game's Career mode is split into two basic sets of courses and challenges; Racing and Freestyle courses. The racing portion contains both Supercross and Nationals tracks. Supercross tracks, for the uninitiated, are the indoor tracks where everything is basically set up on 90 degree lines. The Nationals are the outdoor racing tracks, and for my money, are the more fun of the two as they're much more varied than the Supercross tracks. Freestyle courses are huge, wide-open ranges with plenty of hills, ramps and whatnot to launch from.   As you'd assume, both the racing and freestyle portions of the Career mode are played in a somewhat linear fashion. That is, you start with a couple racing series and one Freestyle course open and you must finish those to unlock later courses. The beautiful part, though, is that you don't have to finish every series to move on, and the game allows you to play to your strengths. Allow me to elaborate...     Rainbow Studios realizes that not all players are equally good at each of the Supercross, Nationals and Freestyle racing events, so they've allowed players to unlock (pretty much) everything in multiple ways. The Career mode is based on a ranking system, so as long as you're ranked high enough, you can compete in any racing series. This will allow you to only race in the Nationals races, for example, and open all the courses. Or oppositely, if you suck goat ass at the Nationals, you can stick to the Supercross races, or you can mix up the two and skip racing series until you've unlocked all the racing courses. I'll get to the Freestyle courses in a second...   Now, not only can you choose to skip courses, you can buy them or practically anything else in the game with points you've earned. Points are simply the stunt points that you earn in any given Racing or Freestyle event, which are added to an accumulative total for you to spend. This means that if you're absolutely terrible at the game and finish last in every single race you ever try, as long as you can pull off a trick or two here and there, you'll eventually earn enough points to buy all tracks, vehicles, bikes, goals, etc. in the game and unlock almost everything. You'll still have to ace every race to unlock the last track, but at least that gives you a goal if you take the easy (but long) route.    Rainbow Studios is to be commended for how they've laid out the Career mode, their points system and how you're able to unlock things. It's somewhat akin to Super Smash Bros. Melee in that it allows you to unlock stuff in multiple ways, and this lets players all of skill types and style eventually earn nearly everything that this game has to offer, as long as they play it long enough. It'll take you a long time to unlock things by simply buying them, but you have the option if you need or want it. Bravo, Rainbow.   Now, back to the Freestyle courses. One of your goals here is to score higher than X amount of points in a couple minutes. That hasn't changed from the Motocross Madness games. But what's cool is that there are now multiple challenges on each of the Freestyle courses. You've now got Run, Hit and Machine Race challenges along with the point challenge. As you're cruising around the course, you'll see what essentially look like pillars of light that mark the starting points for the different challenges. Simply cruise up to one and choose to try it.   The Machine Race challenges pit you against some sort of vehicle on each of the stages; beat it, and you can switch to it and race with it at any time, sans the middle of another challenge. You'll race things like a Monster Truck, airplane, helicopter and more. It's a somewhat useless feature to drive these things as there aren't any goals to complete, but it's rather fun to drive a Monster Truck around one of the Freestyle courses and just wreck into stuff or the AI motorists that drive around. What's neat though is that after you beat one of the vehicles, it becomes ~live~ on the track and drives around on its own. A small thing, indeed, but it adds a little more life to the environment and is rather cool.   The Run challenges give you a series of jumps that must be completed in succession. You'll see a green box covering a ramp, which is your takeoff point, and a red box where you should land. You'll have to make a number of these jumps in a row without missing or wrecking in order to complete the challenge. It's good practice for learning the subtleties of preloading your jumps. The Hit challenges are basically the same as the Run challenges, except that you don't have to complete the set all at once, and you're competing against other riders to see who can finish them all first. Each course has a number of each of the Hit and Run challenges, but only one of each of the Trick and Machine Race challenges.     Opening more Freestyle courses in the Career mode is done by completing a certain percentage of the goals in previous Freestyle courses. This brings up one of the two problems with the Freestyle courses. First, it's not clear how much you have to do to open the next Freestyle track. Do you have to complete 80% of the previous track's goals, or only 50%? Who knows? The next track in the series simply tells you ~Locked~ if you can't race it, while the regular racing courses will tell you what ranking you need to open them. This can be a bit confusing as you don't always know how much more you have to do to move on to the next Freestyle event, but this is only a minor problem.   What's worse, though, is that it can be very hard to tell what goals you've completed in the Freestyle courses while racing. You can view the status of your challenges via the pause menu and it clearly marks off what you've done on this screen, but when you're roaming about it can be hard to find the start points for the goals you still need to complete. All open goals, including those that you've already completed, are always visible and it can be hard to find the goals you haven't beaten yet. There's a checkmark above those that you've completed, but the game's camera sometimes makes it hard to see the checkmark or read the challenge number until you're too close to see it. Moving the camera around a bit can help this somewhat, but dynamically swinging the camera around while you're cruising across the countryside can be quite confusing and disorienting. While this isn't really a game stopper, it can slow progression down a bit between goals.    Outside of the Career mode, you can play any of the tracks you've unlocked in various ways. The Freestyle tracks just pop you in the course, and you can either tool around and throw yourself into trees (we call that practicing) or try any of the Hit, Run or Machine Race goals that you've opened in the Career mode. The Supercross and Nationals tracks let you compete in practice races, ghost races or just drive around them like the Freestyle tracks. While the game isn't online, you're able to play almost any mode in split-screen with a buddy or imaginary friend.   One of the things that Motocross Madness fans will be happy to see return is the penalty for attempting to leave any of the game's Freestyle courses. All of the Freestyle tracks have very large and steep hills as boundaries. You're not supposed to climb them, but Rainbow is ready and willing to let you do so. Only, if you do, you'll be literally thrown thousands of feet across the land, only to land in a crumpled heap on the ground. It's quite funny and I recommend doing this first upon popping the game into your system. Just make sure you're not drinking milk at the time.   Graphics  Visually, the game looks rather similar to Rainbow's previous land-based console efforts, ATV Offroad Fury 1 and 2. While the game isn't astonishingly gorgeous, it's the amount of what you see and the details therein that count. For starters, the landscapes are huge. The game has a fairly impressive draw distance, letting you see quite a ways into the distance. There's a nice fogging effect, so you'll see things fade in rather smoothly rather than pop into view. There are also tons of trees, foliage, and general ~stuff~ littering the courses. Everything looks quite nice indeed.   As the freestyle landscapes are huge, and setting up a long run can be paramount to a good session, we're quite happy to see draw distance preferred over less gameplay dependent features like crazy amounts of unnecessary bump-mapping or the like. Even with such a large draw distance, the framerate is rock-solid.     The most visually appealing thing about the game is how the riders and bikes interact with everything around/underneath them. The bikes' wheels bounce over hills, the shocks compress as this happens and the bikes generally move like they should in real-life. Likewise, the riders bounce and move about quite realistically. There's a certain amount of polish to the whole thing that just reeks of experience. It's unlikely you'll find a more natural looking game in terms of physics anytime soon.   One last highlight that we'll file under the graphics category is your rider's ragdoll physics. Actually, it's probably not correct to call it ragdoll, as that implies a complete limpness of the body after crashing. The mangled bodies in this game actually try and maintain some sort of realistic form to them, meaning that the arms and legs of crash-ees won't flop around haplessly as if attached by strings. Rather, they appear to bend much like human limbs would, arms and legs folding correctly, which make the crashes seem quite a bit more painful than if the riders went completely limp after first flying from the bike. Good stuff.    Sound  The game's soundtrack is your standard mix of new-metal rock, with roughly a dozen tracks or so. The track selections are decent and fairly par for the course, so while it's nothing groundbreaking, it works. You do start hearing the same tracks over and over again since the song count is reasonably low, but as you'll be concentrating on the race at hand you won't be paying much attention anyway.   Engine sounds are pretty nice though, if the sound of motocross bikes doesn't bother you. I can see people turning the game's volume down due to the rather whiny nature of how the bikes sound, but they're represented really well. The pitch of engine sounds constantly change as your bike navigates the varied terrain and everything sounds pretty good. There's honestly not much else to say about that.MX Unleashed is a winner, and that's that. It's really well polished, controls great, looks good and is presented very nicely. You'd really have a hard time finding a racing game that's more fun to just fool around in, cruise about the country side and wreck the living crap out of yourself.While the game isn't as deep as say SSX 3, there's still quite a bit to it. The Career mode will last you a reasonable bit of time, but even when that's over, you'll still want to keep this near your system. It's just fun, and there's not really a better way to put it. I can't wait to see what Rainbow and THQ have in store for the next one.", "date": "Feb 13, 2004"}
