Before Sony, SEGA, and Nintendo, there was good old Atari and before we invented the word ~video game console~, there was only one format to enjoy Atari's simple yet addictive games - the arcades.  Displayed in large, expensive, and decorative arcade cabinets, classics like Tempest, Crystal Castles, and Warlords gave birth to several current day hits and although Atari isn't the video game powerhouse it used to be, you have to respect the rich history of Atari's past video wonders.  For those folks that still respect old school gaming, Atari Anniversary Collection is a definite must-have title delivering classic gaming emulated perfectly as well as displaying the interesting history of the birth of arcade games.  A dozen classic Atari titles are selectable, and while some of those younger gamers out there may not know all of them, you're not worth your salt as a gamer if you haven't heard of Missile Command, Centipede, or the all-time classic of Pong.  The rest include: Asteroids Asteroids Deluxe Battlezone Crystal Castles Gravitar Millipede Super Breakout Tempest Warlords  All the above titles have been faithfully emulated in two types of modes: cabinet and full screen.  The latter needs no explanation, while cabinet mode essentially views the action with all the cabinet elements of the original game.  These include the original start buttons, unique joystick controls (i.e paddle controls for), as well as screen border sticker designs.  The whole novelty of this is pretty cute, but if you really want to play the game, stick to the full screen mode.  The games play virtually identical to their arcade counterparts though for some game, you'll definitely have to get used to playing on a Dreamcast pad.  Battlezone plays pretty well on pad, as well as Centipede and Millipede, but the challenge comes into games like Warlords, Tempest, and Crystal Castles, all of which used unique joystick controls in the arcades.  It's not that they play badly with the Dreamcast controls; you just have to get used to limiting yourself to left and right motions on the D-pad for the paddle games.  All the games play with great responsiveness and they look virtually identical to their real-life arcade counterparts; there have been no attempts to improve the visuals at all from their original state at all.  Although the visuals may turn off the younger group of gamers out there, it also serves as a reminder of how far we've come.  Beyond the classic gaming joy you'll experience, Atari: Anniversary Collection hosts a great number of extras to view.  You'll be able to see original cabinet art, bumper stickers, and lots of other great Atari collectibles from the past.  This makes Atari: Anniversary Collection a wonderful addition to any old school gamer and even for the younger crowd who may not appreciate the archaic visuals, it's recommended for it's ~learning purposes~, just to show how deep the roots of video games run.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 31, 2001"}
