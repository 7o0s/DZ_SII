One X-Man in particular, the diminutive and cantankerous Wolverine, has been a touchstone of angst and anger in comic books, cartoons, and feature films. As the undeniable star of the X-Men feature films, Wolverine's popularity has grown tremendously. It's been a long while since Wolverine made a solo appearance in the videogame world, but as the world's most recognizable mutant, it's only natural that he should make his solo debut just a handful of weeks before the release of the latest X-Men movie, X2: X-Men United.  Of course, being popular doesn't mean success is assured. With his previous adventures limited to 2D side-scrolling platformers, there were no guarantees Wolverine would translate into a 3D world (fighting games aside). Still, with his growing popularity and recognition, it would seem the old Canucklehead could do no wrong. But perhaps Wolvie's age is catching up to him, because the flaws in his latest game, X2: Wolverine's Revenge, may be too many for even his famed healing factor to mend.  Though it shares part of the movie name in its title, X2: Wolverine's Revenge has little linking it to the film. In fact, the story of Revenge is much more closely tied to X-Men comic book continuity. Written by veteran Wolverine scribe, Larry Hama, Revenge tells a very plausible story in terms of X-Men continuity. Things kick off with Wolverine learning he only has 48 hours before he dies from the mysterious Shiva Virus. Dr. Cornelius, the man responsible for the Weapon X project which bonded adamantium to Wolverine's bones, implanted the virus as a fail-safe device in case Wolverine ever went rogue. Wolvie's healing factor has kept the virus at bay the past few decades, but time's finally caught up with the Canuck.  As the story progresses, Wolverine must return to the Weapon X facility that first spawned him and confront his past while dealing with an array of villains, including Sabretooth, Juggernaut and Lady Deathstrike. Fortunately, he gets an assist from fellow X-Men like Colossus and Professor X.  Often times movie and comic book licensed games have convoluted stories that make no sense and seem to have no place in the hero's world. But Revenge must be given a ~whoop whoop~ for creating a story that feels authentic to the character, is interesting for fans, and relies on parts of comic book continuity casual fans may be unaware of. The best example is in Wolvie's battle with Magneto, where the two acknowledge their past comic book history and have a polite little chat about the time Magneto ripped the adamantium from Wolverine's bones (X-Men #25).  The story is probably Revenge's brightest asset.  It's the gameplay that, unfortunately, proves to be a serious letdown.  Wolvie's Revenge is a mixture of action and stealth combat. There are some minor adventure elements mixed in, but this is essentially all about getting from point A to point B and killing as many people along the way as possible. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then Revenge probably won't be your game, but if you enjoy a sort of old-school action feel mixed in with some stealth combat, Revenge may yet be worth your time, provided you can deal with the many faults.  Wolverine has several powers that he's known for. His super senses, healing factor, and adamantium claws are all represented in the game. One button will extend or retract the blades of death and when the claws are retracted, Wolverine slowly regains health. Few have done a decent job recreating super senses in a videogame, so Wolverine's Revenge is the first. By holding down another button, Wolverine enters a super sense mode. The world turns orange, recent footsteps become visible, enemy scents appears as a green trail, and hidden obstacles like mines show up as spinning things.  Controls themselves are relatively simple, but there were a few strange choices made that just don't make sense. Both the super sense and stealth modes require you to hold down the button to stay in that mode. This is a bit of a pain, particularly for stealth mode. Why not let me toggle stealth on and off, so that I'd be free to press any of the other buttons while in stealth mode? Stealth is encouraged in the level design, but not in the interface.  Bad call. Seriously, why put a heavy emphasis on stealth in the game at all? Wolverine is all about chopping open a wall, busting through, cutting everyone up with extreme prejudice and then moving through the next wall. Thank God he doesn't wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle...   Also perplexing is the decision to make the game barnyard simple. And there's the primary attack and then there's the kick. You can punch a few times for various ~combos,~ but these are basically just a few different slashing moves. The cool stuff comes with the strike combos. When an enemy is stunned or when you have multiple enemies in specific positions, arrows appear pointing at your targets and the word ~Strike~ flashes onscreen. Hit action and Wolverine executes an impressive move. But it's so dumb and debilitating by an insanely aggravating lock-on feature that it holds little worth. Note to everyone: take Buffy for the Xbox, put claws on her, call her Wolverine, throw her into a world with more interactivity and destructible environments and bam! You have a near perfect game. Just don't do this.  By progressing through the Revenge, you can earn even cooler moves, which requires one or two extra button presses to pull off. Whee. But, it stays pretty simple throughout. Problem is, as cool as the moves look, once you've initiated them you just sit back and watch 'em play out. Not cool, bub. Five seconds of having no control and just watching amounts to a cutscene. It even manages to break up game flow. I'd rather have had to pull off a combo string (or even just hit one button repeatedly) to do a cool move than to have been forced to get into a specific position and press a button and watch. Let me do the cool move. It doesn't provide the sense of accomplishment a game's supposed to offer.      This dumbed-down approach isn't bad at first, because everything is new. But get yourself a few levels into the game and it starts to feel old, quickly. These strike combo moves are the quickest way to take people down and so they end up becoming a focus of the hand-to-hand Revenge experience. It's not truly abysmal, but it could have been infinitely better had it required more from the user.  The other combat focus is with stealth. By sneaking up on enemies (it's basically all line of sight), you can initiate a strike when ~Strike~ flashes on the screen for an instant. Presto, silent kill. You can also sneak along a wall and stealth kill enemies around corners. Very cool when it works, but the line of sight and stealth functionality aren't perfect. There are lots of moments where I'd literally walk past an enemy and they wouldn't see me as long as I was holding stealth. Other times they seemed to see me before I'd even entered a room. And there's a trick where you can go into stealth mode and circle an enemy. They'll follow you, turning around as you circle them, but won't fire until you've stopped moving.    The AI is just too primitive. Aside from this little bug, there are lots of moments where enemies will get stuck in AI patterns and just walk in place, or won't notice you even though you're going toe-to-toe with their buddy just a few feet away. It's insanity.  Maybe in a straight up action game this wouldn't be so noticeable, but when you introduce stealth elements into the mix, AI becomes much more important. Now, despite the problems, it is a lot of fun stealth killing fools, however inappropriate it may be. Especially cool is when you drop down from above to slaughter someone. It's a crucial part of the gameplay at times, but most of the level design is set up to let you pass with either a stealth or a run and claw mentality.    You can't totally knock stealth options and some of the level design is really smart, but there are so many nagging problems that can't be ignored... Combat is simplistic considering how the game was designed. Once stealth is introduced into a game, the level of AI sophistication must be raised up a notch. It just wasn't bumped up that notch for Revenge and the whole time you're still dealing with jacked fighting.  Thankfully, the boss battles are pretty cool. This is very much old school reminiscent, as there is a specific way to beat each boss and your challenge is figuring out their weakness. Many of the boss battles, though, boil down to hitting them a bunch of times and then throwing them into something.  My only gripe here is that you can't choose the direction you throw the boss. So unless Sabretooth is facing the exact position you need, you won't throw him into the tanker in level three. It's a bit frustrating. The bosses themselves are well-realized and feel like the real deal, so it's not all that bad.  Though Wolverine's Revenge is a relatively straight-forward game without branching pathways or intense replay value, developer Genepool added a few incentives that are noteworthy. Comic book covers are hidden throughout the levels. Find a cover and unlock one of Wolverine's classic costumes. Patch, the brown getup, and Wolvie's New X-Men gear are among the costumes available. Data cards with character profiles are also hidden throughout the levels. These offer descriptions for each character and are a definite help to neophyte Wolverine fans.  Stealth kills are encouraged through the dog tag system. Each stealth kill earns you a dog tag (each successful boss battle also rewards you with dog tags). Collect enough dog tags and Wolverine's strike combo level increases to allow for more impressive attacks. As the game progressed, I found the stealth attacks became a necessity and not merely a luxury. But the dog tags help add a little extra incentive.  Granted, Wolverine isn't the prettiest mug in the comic book universe, regardless of what costume he's wearing, but that hardly means his videogame needs to share all his rough edges. Filled with tons of clipping, weak textures, unspectacular effects, poor environmental blending, stiff animations, and odd, angular designs right out of the Spider-Man game (not the movie-based one), Wolverine's Revenge looks almost identical on all systems. And that's not acceptable, because cross-platform games should still take advantage of what each platform has to offer, while leaving the weaknesses at the door. The sometimes funky enemy animations and hideously rendered Professor X just don't cut it. A decent-looking game at first glance, but nothing special in any way, whatsoever, this is.  The music is also minimal, but then not truly bad. Don't worry about catching all of the tempo-increases in the score, which attempt to accent the action-heavy and suspenseful moments. It's not that important.  What did you think of Wolverine's Revenge?  Voice acting is a mixed bag. Mark Hamill does a fantastic job and Patrick Stewart is, of course, great as Professor X. Though, I couldn't help but feel the man who played the Joker was a bit out of place. I've heard Australian Wolverines, gruff Wolverines, Hugh Jackman Wolverines, and now Mark Hamill Wolverines... Where's the consistency? The rest of the supporting cast is strong. Unfortunately, the voices can't cover up the endlessly repetitive sound effects. ~Rarr~ Wolverine cries out again and again and again. ~Better use my senses!~ What do adamantium claws sound like cutting into wood? Apparently the same as they do cutting into metal or flesh. The hardest thing for a licensed game is capturing the essence of the character. Revenge succeeds with a story and style that fits Wolvie, but the gameplay has far too many holes and the sound and graphics are nothing special. This is also a relatively short title, able to be finished in about eight hours. There are bonus challenges, which add an extra hour or two of gameplay, but this isn't a game you'll play twice. This one's probably best as a weekend borrow from a friend unless you are an absolute hardcore Wolverine fan who must have everything. If you find this, later on in life, on some store shelf for $10 or even, go for it. But at full price, you'll be the one screaming ~Raarr!~Remember folks... If you want a killer third-person action game that's heavy on the combat with Wolverine in it, take Buffy, add claws, add Red Faction-esque destructible environments, and go nuts. All this lame locking on, being stealthy, performing advanced moves with a single tap, dealing with a wretched camera system crap needs to go straight out the window fast.", "date": "Apr 16, 2003"}
