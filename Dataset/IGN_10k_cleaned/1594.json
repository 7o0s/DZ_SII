{"name": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf", "name_review": "Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/06/tiger-woods-pga-tour-golf-3", "text": "EA Sports' PGA Tour golf series is the longest running videogame golf series on any home gaming console and year after year it's often considered to be among the genre's very best. This year's edition, simply titled Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf (note the absence of the 2001 in the title), marks the third year that the company has used the extremely marketable Tiger Woods license in conjunction with the standard license for the PGA Tour.    Gameplay  In addition to having Tiger Woods, who's not only golf's biggest name but also one of the most well known in all of sports, the game also gives players the chance to play as any one of seven other PGA pros including Leonard, O'Meara, Calcavecchia, Janzen, Faxon, Damron, and Cink in various gameplay modes including Practice, Stroke, Skins, Tournament, Match and a Challenge Mode that has players try and make the cut as a real pro golfer. And the courses that are available include Poppy Hills, TPC at Sawgrass, TPC at Summerlin, TPC of Scottsdale, Badlands Golf Club, and TPC at The Canyons.   The basic play mechanics of the game is pretty standard as far as golf games go. In digital mode, the players are offered a simple three point swing meter with a basic horizontal bar -- press a button to start the meter, press again to set the strength of the swing and press for a final time for the accuracy. And in analog mode, players can use the left analog stick of the Dual Shock controller to simulate the swing by pressing down to start the backswing and pressing forward once the desired shot strength is met to simulate the swing -- the hook and slice is determined by how straight the analog stick is pressed forward.   The thing about this year's version that really stands out is that the general pace of the game is faster than ever before. Even for diehard fans, golf videogames can get a bit tiresome after a while because it can sometimes take up to an hour just to finish a single round of 18 holes, but this isn't a problem here because most games take in the area of only 15 minutes. This means that players will be able to finish a whole tournament in the same time that it usually takes to finish a single round in most golf simulations. The only downer is that while the pace of game has been picked up a lot, there's still some slow points thanks to long load times in between holes.   Graphics  If there were a major complaint to be made about this game, it'd most likely be geared towards its visuals. The game suffers from some serious problems in this area that actually hamper the game's overall experience to a certain extent. There are some serious framerate problems at times and the game's just plagued with an overabundance of clipping and pop-up. What's more, the players don't quite look like they belong on the 3D backgrounds and the animation, while good, seems more scripted than natural.   Sound  If you're a big fan of the type of music you hear in porn, then you might just love what you get here in Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf. Some of the music sounds straight out of a triple-X movie, while the other beats sound even less inspired. To top it all off in the audio department, the voiceovers by Tiger are bland and boring and some of the sound effects just seem a bit unrealistic. For instance, the sound of the golf balls hitting the grass sound more like a racquetball hitting a wall that what it should sound like.  Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf is definitely a step up over last year's version and is actually quite enjoyable thanks to its quick pace and easy swing meters, but still needs some major upgrades in its visuals and overall presentation. The Tiger Woods license is a great one and it would make a lot of sense for EA Sports to make better use of it with more lively voiceovers and just more of them. The game's a solid golf game that should please the fans of console golf sims, but not those that are into deeper sims on the PC or more arcade-oriented efforts like Hot Shots Golf.", "date": "Dec 6, 2000"}
