After all, George Lucas revisited the Star Wars Universe with an entire trilogy of films; Batman Begins provided a grittier, more realistic foundation for the Dark Knight; and the story of the ~birth~ of Solid Snake's nemesis Big Boss was told with Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. But apparently that wasn't enough. Creator Hideo Kojima decided to revisit his last effort to truly ~complete~ one of his two planned Metal Gear trilogies. With Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, Kojima has not only provided the ~director's cut~ of one of the top games of 2004, but has also given series fans a myriad of extra features... while simultaneously creating one of the best PlayStation 2 games ever made.   Of course, before I go any further, I have to mention that the sheer amount of gameplay in MGS3 is colossal and going over it all again would make this article far too long a read. With that in mind, I urge you to check out IGN's original Metal Gear Solid 3 review for specific impressions regarding the source material's core gameplay elements -- we all share the exact same sentiments. Anyhow, on to the new game we go!   Don't expect the game to be any easier. Subsistence  The first disc, called Subsistence, presents Snake Eater in its entirety with a number of tweaks. First of all, you're immediately presented with six difficulty choices. New to this bunch is the inclusion of European Extreme, which immediately ends the game if Snake is spotted by any guard. Needless to say, the additional difficulty level will challenge even the most expert player of the game. The biggest reason why this is significant is because saved games of the original Snake Eater will not be recognized by the Subsistence disc; in effect, the remix forces you to replay the title once again.   The added bonus of this return to the 1960s is that you have an opportunity to experience Snake's missions with a new camera perspective as well. The original title had a somewhat flawed top-down perspective that would only shift slightly to give you a different angle for in-game action. Subsistence, on the other hand, now provides a third-person camera centered behind Snake that can be rotated, tilted and panned around as much as you'd like. The addition of the new camera practically turns Snake Eater into a completely new game, and it can be toggled back and forth at the press of a button.   All PAL-exclusive face paints and camos are now included. The remixed Snake Eater also expands on the number of camouflage sets that players can use to disguise themselves. This means that right at the beginning of the game, Snake will automatically have the nine flag face paints that were previously only available for regional downloads. While these facial disguises are a great way to instill national pride for some players, they're really only useful in certain situations. The same can be said about the twenty additional uniforms that can be downloaded to your memory card, though some of these are much more useful than the face paint and do add another layer of depth for your stealthy pleasure.    While I won't spoil any story points or the ending, I will mention that the final addition, which is called the Demo Theater, is great. This mode provides access to the numerous cutscenes found throughout the game. What's cool is that you can select one specific movie to enjoy, or even replay an entire section if you want, and you can even access a secret inexplicable moment that needs to be seen to be believed. What's also nice about the Demo Theater is that you can actively change the look of Snake in every cutscene. For instance, if you want your hero with zombie face paint and the scientist uniform, you can do it. If you want to watch him face off against a boss fight in a tuxedo, you can do that as well. It's relatively strange once you know what scenes are supposed to look like but it's cool to screw with all of them.   Persistence  The second disc, titled Persistence, is where the true meat of MGS3: Subsistence lies and where it accomplishes the unheard of task of being a better game. This disc is packed with lots of extra modes and features that will please any Metal Gear fan and newbies alike. Let's start out with the two most immediate bonuses, the inclusion of Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. Never before seen on North American shores (outside of enterprising importers) Persistence holds pixel-perfect ports of both MSX versions. This includes the true sequel to the original and not the bastardization that was known as Snake's Revenge and includes brand new English translations.   Until now, U.S. gamers couldn't play the true Metal Gear 2. The original Metal Gear, released in Japan and Europe in 1987, was the story of Solid Snake, the new operative of a secret organization named FOXHOUND. Snake's first assignment was rescuing a fellow agent and destroying a new weapon of mass destruction in a rogue fortified state known as Outer Heaven. Of course, the weapon happens to be the eponymously-named Metal Gear, which Snake discovers is being built under the command of a surprising foe. If you haven't played it before you need to, it's a fantastic game and even with its dated visuals still plays excellently.   The sequel, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake was a title released only in Japan in 1990. The plot here brings Snake out of retirement by FOXHOUND to infiltrate Zanzibar Land, a heavily fortified territory that kidnapped a successful bio-scientist. By controlling the invention of the scientist, which is a new kind of energy form, the terrorists plan to hold the world hostage. While Snake tries to rescue the scientist, he also discovers that his last foe (still miraculously alive from their last confrontation) is in control of a new Metal Gear that he must destroy. It too is a solid game from the 8-bit glory days and it's a real treat to be able to play it for the first time all these years later.   Relive this moment anytime you want. Building on a boss battle concept, Disc 2 also includes a Duel Mode that lets you square off against some of the most memorable moments and every single boss fight in MGS3. For instance, you can relive the shootout between Snake and the guards at Rassvet, or you fight off one of the Cobras. Unlike these situations in the actual game, you're not fighting to progress the story; instead, you're fighting against both the clock and a high score. Points are calculated by the amount of time you took, the number of ammunition and explosives left in your backpack and other factors. Not only is this a fun way to reenact some of the best moments of the game, it's also a great way to come up with new strategies on how to defeat these enemies when you're playing the main quest.    Persistence also marks the return of Snake vs. Monkey with a few new maps, for fans of the simian catching game. But perhaps even funnier than that is the inclusion of the Secret Theater -- which features the comic work of the Real Time Demo Unit from the Snake Eater development team. Initially created as an internal joke, nine of the Theater clips were eventually released on the Snake Eater web site. The Secret Theater includes all of these items, as well as eight new joke spots lampooning the action and the characters of Snake Eater. This includes the E3 trailer from 2005 for Metal Gear Solid 4, which jokingly features Raiden continually seeking the director's chair of the ~main character,~ only to be refused that honor by faceless guards and Snake himself.   However, the largest and most significant feature is the online mode, which provides multiplayer support for up to eight players using the Snake Eater engine. Five game types are included in the online play, including the standard Deathmatch and team Deathmatch modes, which can be played across 12 separate maps inspired by sections of MGS3. While they're not exactly ripped from the game, astute players will be able to recognize certain areas that you'll be fighting across. Players are also introduced to sneaking, capture and rescue missions, each of which are slightly different than what they first seem.   Stealth is just as important in multiplayer mode as it is in single. The Sneaking missions are a ~me against the world~ kind of situation, where one player takes on the role of Snake while everyone else plays as opposing guards. Snake's objective for this mission is to steal microfilm (which players will readily recognize) and take it to a goal; the guards, obviously, have to prevent this by any and all means. While it may sound extremely unfair to have such skewed odds against Snake, he does have an ace up his sleeve in terms of camouflage that can render him invisible to the naked eye. Similar to the effect from the Predator movies, Snake can run past most guards undetected as long as he doesn't equip a weapon or have the microfilm in his possession.   The Capture missions are team-based missions and task you with capturing a Kerotan idol (aka a frog), bringing it back to your squad's goal and holding it there for a number of seconds. This ~Capture the Frog~ game is relatively standard, although it can be particularly tense on some of the smaller maps where the goals are practically next to each other. Finally, the rescue missions are somewhat similar to that of ~hostage~ multiplayer modes in other titles; the red team is tasked with protecting a GA-KO (or rubber duck) until time runs out or the other side is eliminated. The blue team is tasked with taking the idol and returning it to their goal as soon as possible. If you're curious, Kerotan is definitely the office favorite.   Expect a number of surprise playable characters. What's extremely cool about the multiplayer is the wealth of options available for you to customize your experience before matches. For instance, players have access to buddy lists as well as personal stats which are tracked on the server, including how many rounds you've survived, the number of idols you've placed on a goal or the number of times you've communicated to your teammates. Now that's cool.    Another wanted feature is used when creating a game: you can queue up to fifteen mission types, in any arrangement you'd like, to fight through, one after the other, until you've exhausted the list. You can specify certain sides that will fight through maps, such as the GRU, Ocelot or KGB, as well as the kinds of primary and secondary weapon types that can be used in each map. For the hardcore, you can literally restrict it to a knife fight and CQC (or close quarters combat) if you're so inclined. There are even special characters you play as.   Thankfully, the multiplayer mode takes full advantage of the third person view in the middle of a match, and the framerate is extremely stable and smooth. In fact, regardless of the number of people in our matches and whatever action they were performing, we weren't able to detect the slightest bit of lag through our numerous hours of play. The only strange thing we found were slight animation ~cheats~ where you could trigger a CQC combat accurately even if the victim was a couple of feet apart from your character, but these are minor hiccups that happened every now and then. There are a number of details from the single-player game that stand out as well, such as blades of grass that break and flutter away as you run through them. This is easily what you'll wind up playing when you've mastered the story of Snake Eater.   Find the frog or die! Existence  The third and final disc will only be found in the limited edition of Subsistence. Known as Existence, it holds the re-edited footage of every cinematic from Snake Eater into a full-length movie. Actually, it's more than your standard length film -- it comes across more like an epic. Featuring new narration, more than three and a half hours of cutscenes with new camera angles, and soundtrack underscoring (with techno beats during action sequences), along with an option to view the film with English or Spanish subtitles, this is the definitive vision of the story of Snake Eater through Kojima's eyes. As an added bonus, the disc holds the 2005 TGS trailer for Metal Gear Solid 4, which gives a glimpse of what the future adventures of Snake will bring.   Remaking the footage to build a fully scripted film is a great idea -- in theory. In practice it's somewhat underwhelming for a number of reasons. First, there's a new narrator providing summary information in-between chapters and for major transitions that has never been featured in the game. It's not voiced by Major Tom, Sigint or any other character, making some of the moves between sections feel disconnected and more contrived than establishing a natural flow.   Relive all your favorite cutscenes! Secondly, the break in video between native cutscenes from the original Snake Eater and gameplay footage culled together to fill in the missing spaces is extremely jarring and noticeable because of the shift in quality. In fact, you'll detect a lot of artifacting and blurring of action thanks to new camera angles. Most of these happen during boss fights and other ~transitional~ moments where Snake is taking opponents down or moving from area to area. It would've been great if these sections were redone entirely with new cutscenes, or there was an option to plug in the original and improved footage.    The third and perhaps most significant issue with the disc is that it is essentially superfluous thanks to the Demo Theater. Sure, you lose out on the new narration and perhaps even the artistic choice of the camera angles, but you essentially have the ability to create your own film version of Snake Eater. Plus, you don't wind up losing some of the additional backstory or make as many random jumps as the film seems to do.   The big question, of course, is does all this extra stuff in the game's third disc really warrant depression if you can't get your hands on the limited edition? Realistically I would say no unless you're such a diehard fan of the series that you can't live without regardless of its artistic merit, or if you're a videogame collector that can't get enough of all the special editions being released lately. If you're just a regular Joe, however, it's a nice bonus but it isn't crucial to the set.   The limited edition even has a sneak peek of MGS4. 2004's Snake Eater was a fantastic but slightly-flawed game. Alternatively, Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence goes a long way towards remedying the few problems of that acclaimed title with a brand new camera system that literally rejuvenates the gameplay. The online mode adds a ton of replay value as well and has dozens of options to keep you returning to blow away friends late into the night. For fans of the series, the additional extras, including the two theater modes and original Metal Gear games are bonuses that are simply not to be missed. For the price and the extras, you can't go wrong with Subsistence -- even for those that have played and beaten the first game once or several more times, it still can't be missed.", "date": "Mar 10, 2006"}
