Having never played these three titles myself when they were originally released, I'm forced to review Phantasy Star Collection for the Game Boy Advance primarily on the latter which, considering the majority of the people who will be purchasing this title, is probably the best way to go.  Features Conversions of three different RPG games Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  Phantasy Star pre-dated Sonic as Sega's first stellar flagship series. Released in Japan in 1987, only two days before Square unveiled its own Final Fantasy, Phantasy Star debuted on Sega's 8-bit Master System. However it beat both Final Fantasy and 1986's Dragon Quest/Warrior series to US shores by well over a year. Because of this, the game was many American gamers' first venture into a deep, turn-based RPG, so understandably a lot of nostalgia surrounds the series. As part of their recent GBA partnership, THQ and Sega worked with developer Digital Eclipse to re-release the first three games in the series on a single GBA cart last November.   But are the games any good? In some ways, yes. Compared to quality tailor-made GBA RPG's like Golden Sun, the games obviously don't do as much visually. But since the graphics for all three were created over a decade ago, they're not expected to. Phantasy Star was unique among its contemporary 8-bit RPGs because although it featured the typical 'heroes with swords fighting monsters' theme, it had a sleek, futuristic look that's been carried on through the Dreamcast and Gamecube versions. The story also had a sort of tongue-in-cheek, B-movie appeal that was involving, but never took itself too seriously (at least, I hope it's not trying to).   Phantasy Star I introduces us to the planet Palma, in Space Century 342 (hey, at one time this probably sounded pretty cool). You play heroine Alis, a young woman who lives under the monocratic rule of Lassic, the game's obligatory corrupt ruler. When your brother Nero dies attempting to rebel against the government (at the hands of the spooky Robotcops), it's your job to seek out help from a warrior, a telekinetic and a talking cat thingy to brave the monster-ridden landscapes of three planets, overthrow Lassic and discover what's turned your usually peaceful solar system into the breeding ground for evil it currently is.   The game plays like most early RPGs, which means plenty of wandering over repetitive backgrounds, chatting with village locals to find out where you go next and many, many random monster battles. Each time you encounter some creatures, you and your party have the option to attack, run, cast spells, use items or just chat with the monsters (which I love to do since 90% of the monsters can't understand me and I end up taking a beating). As opposed to Final Fantasy, battles occur in an over-the-shoulder view (although you won't get to actually see your characters during battle until Phantasy Star II) and can get a little boring when you're running into enemies every ten steps. However the artwork is actually pretty decent across the board and in respect to backgrounds, style and color the game has aged much better than its competition from the time. Most early RPGs tended to be comprised of sprites, menus and a whole lotta black. But Phantasy Star's backgrounds and characters meld well, and really give the illusion of lush locales, instead of just fighting baddies in a floating menu system. Animation, while minimal, is fluid and luckily for us GBA owners, the original games wasted a lot of screen space at the borders so you lose almost nothing on the GBA's slightly smaller resolution.   The gameplay is a little repetitive, though. Enemies pop up a little too constantly and don't further the story as much as just bog you down and make getting from point A to B take longer, thus extending the life of the game. With each fight you raise your heroes' stats, but if you're not already a fan of menu-heavy turn-based RPGs, this game certainly won't convert you.   With the sequel, 1989's Phantasy Star II, everything suddenly went anime. The intro got more cinematic, and all the characters looked like extras from ~Dirty Pair.~ Each Phantasy Star title, in the Final Fantasy tradition, features new characters from but retains the same spirit, style and many of the same areas. Phantasy Star II puts you on the planet Mota (one of the three planets you visited in the first game), where the supercomputer Mother Brain (apparently some other Mother Brain) is out of control. Overall, this sequel is more of an equal. The in-game graphics have barely changed (despite the jump from an 8-bit to a 16-bit system) and there's just too much dungeon-exploring. Phantasy Star III took the series in a new direction, with graphics that did the Genesis justice, but also tended to forgo the sci-fi aspects for more of a Castlevania look. What is interesting is that you play this game through three different generations of characters and depending on the choices you make, you end up taking control of different characters decades in the future. I dug this; it gave the game a nice, epic feel and did pull me into the story more as I wasn't just controlling some dude named Aron, I was controlling Aron, son of Nial and grandson of Rhys, all of whom I played through the course of the game.   So how's the port? The music, like THQ's recent Sega Smash Pack sounds a little tinny and hollow in places, but there is the occasional hummable tune. The graphics are preserved exactly as they were and lose very little on the GBA's smaller resolution. The text, like many early RPGs does have some glaring grammatical errors here and there, which should have been fixed by THQ but aren't bad enough to take you out of the game. And while I didn't encounter it myself, there have been talks of huge crash bugs while playing Phantasy Star that occurs randomly during saving. So be warned.  So should you buy it? This game is essentially for three types of people. 1) Those who loved the originals and are looking for a stroll down memory-dungeon-lane, 2) Those curious about the genesis (no pun intended) of the world they enjoy in Phantasy Star Online and 3) Those who blow through RPGs in a few days and really want some bang for their buck. For those in the first two groups, you probably already bought this title and if you're on the fence about it, for the pricetag you won't be disappointed. For the third group, this game isn't nearly as impressive as what's being done on the GBA right now for RPGs but at the same time, not a whole lot IS being done on the GBA for RPGs. This is a quick fix that gives you between 50 and 75 hours of gameplay for under $30, and as long as you don't mind wading through repetitious gameplay for some pretty decent stories, you just can't beat the value of the title.", "date": "Apr 8, 2003"}
