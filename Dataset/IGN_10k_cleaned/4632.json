None of them, though, had the ~ripped from the headlines~ immediacy of KumaWar. Nor do any of them come close to the punishing avalanche of mission briefing infodump. You have the actual mission briefing, and a more detailed look, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Each mission carries with it a magazine's worth of genuine newspaper articles, video clips, audio clips, and imagery. You'll get a detailed evaluation of each group involved in each incursion, extensive weapon descriptions, and even a list of tips and tricks tailored to each mission. On top of all this, every mission comes with a fictional news bulletin streamed with Quicktime and running several minutes long. You'll walk into each mission with a pretty deep understanding of its strategic context, historical significance, and all that wholesome knowledge stuff.  I can't lean around corners, though.  That's the first thing I notice. Here I am, in the middle of some bombed-out town that smacks strongly of Black Hawk Down (the game, not the movie, natch). I'm pinned down by some hidden snipers and am running low on ammo. My men are hurt and the enemy is between us and the extraction point. In urban close quarters battle, not being able to lean around a corner is like giving a man a car and taking out the emergency brake, reverse gear, rear view mirror, and radio. It'll work, but eventually you'll get stuck in a bad place because an essential feature is missing.  My men also don't aim very well and don't try to take cover when someone is shooting at them. This is the second thing I notice, when they drop like flies. Their poor pathfinding is intertwined with low AI IQ, and I often have to switch to someone using the TAB key and manually steer them around a tree, pole, or corner of a building. They also don't like squeezing off rounds in semi-automatic mode, which means, in combination with poor aim, that they will chew through ammo if you don't switch to manual control as soon as they start firing, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a squad. Ninety percent of the time I led the team with the sniper, picking off targets before the rest of the group could get within range for a spray n' pray.    You can order them to hold their position, thankfully, which is great when you're moving through corridors, as they won't move aside and are apparently as heavy as lead. When a file of us stopped midway through the hallway of some war-torn apartment building and had to go in the reverse direction, I would be forced to switch my control to the guy in the back, or else I was stuck. Often I would just group them together in some safe-looking place and make them all crouch down and wait while I did the grown-up work. So much for elite hunter-killers.  The enemy AI fares no better, unfortunately, consisting mostly of the usual suicidal run n' gun flavored with a heady bouquet of ~I can see you as soon as you 'round this corner and will be firing upon your position before you've had a chance to blink,~ unless you kinda peek around with the sniper and hit them in the shoulder or foot a few times. They'll crouch and shoot, stand and shoot, but that's about their full complement of moves. They're sitting ducks most of the time, provided you can hit them from far away enough. However, completing an objective within a mission also often triggers enemy spawns in places you've just cleared, and on a few occasions they will pop out of thin air right behind you and pump you full of lead. The consistently tough adversaries are the snipers, who will home in on you when they're at the very edge of the haze. Your reticule will blink in certain directions to show you where they're firing from, but it takes a few tries, and a few deaths, before you finally find the guy behind the tree that's behind a bush that's behind an electrical pole in front of a building with a patio. If there's any silver lining, it's the comically wooden death animations.      Speaking of animation, the visuals aren't exactly the jewel in KumaWar's crown. From it's apparent inability to successfully render antialiasing and anisotropic filtering (on ATI cards, at least) to its use of an edge-of-the-map haze to hide ugly polygon and character model popping, it's like a throwback to four or five years ago. The team members actually look pretty good, but their idle animations are constant and distracting, with constant neck craning and rifle sighting, forcing you to play in first-person mode pretty much all the time.  The strongest technical aspect is the sound. The light assault weapon sounds and feels different from the other machine guns, and the sniper rifle sounds different from the Barrets being used by the enemy. You can also track down sniper fire fairly well just by turning your guy around until you lock on. Grenades are pretty week, though, and I would have liked a shotgun on occasion, instead of the AT4 and/or .45 caliber.  Unfortunately, the actual game content is pretty light at the moment. There's currently only four missions available, although they are supposed to add one every week. It will probably only take you an hour at most to go through each one, which is actually pretty good, but you're still done in the space of an afternoon, for now. More will come, in an episodic download system, but the quality potential is decidedly unpromising. So far, only one mission takes you outside the generic-looking Middle Eastern urban locations. It occurs in the mountains, and is chock-full of bad guys at all elevations. It's refreshingly different environmentally, but the same design flaws keep the Fun Factor at a dull roar.  Lastly, mutliplayer is a bit of a mixed bag. There weren't really any servers up during our play time. Since it doesn't take long to get through the single-player content, we might have simply not have been looking at the right time. But still, it doesn't bode well for the strength of the Kuma community. As this review went to press, so to speak, the Kuma message boards were also still pretty light, with only a few posts a day in the most active section.   With the disappointingly dated visuals, the simplistic combat model, poor AI, and low amount of actual game content, there really isn't much to recommend about KumaWar. About the only consistent positives were overall stability, performance, and a fast pipe for downloading the individual episodes (this is a broadband-only game). They've done a fantastic job of providing a six-course meal of pre-game data, but once you actually get down to business, it plays like a budget game good for little more than killing some time. The client, currently clocking in at well under 300MB, is free, but they want $9.99 a month to keep playing past the initial trial.  With missions set to debut on a weekly basis, there will eventually be quite a few of them to choose from. After downloading the four available missions, the install directory grew to 400MB, so it can add up, but it pales in comparison to Far Cry's 3.5GB and UT 2004's, 5.5GB. Still, other titles in a similar vein offer a much better experience, like Desert Combat, Call of Duty, and Vietcong. KumaWar is a great proof-of-concept that online integration can work, but the production values are just too low to be competitive in today's market. Also, being broadband-only (since you can't buy the game in a box) will limit its appeal.", "date": "Apr 8, 2004"}
