Ask someone from fifty years ago about the technology that would be available today and no doubt they'd regale you with tales of robot butlers, colonies on the moon and machines that can cook any meal at the press of a button. You know what else they'd tell you about? Personal jetpacks. By this stage in human civilisation it would be only natural to assume that we'd all be zipping about the place with rockets strapped to our backs. Sadly, it was not to be.   It's a good thing then, that Nintendo remembers those halcyon promises of the future, and is here to deliver a vision of a world where monkeys have bongo jetpacks and race against one another through treacherous courses filled with lava, ice, monstrous beasts and barrels. Always with the barrels. In theory it's better than any future we could have imagined. In practice, however, it's a jumble of ideas, some of which work, many of which don't.   To paraphrase Gwen Stefani, this shit is bananas.  Jet Race, you see, keeps things simple in some regards, but less so in others. Hop into a race, for instance, and the first thing you'll notice is that you automatically follow the course. Within that path you have room to move, but this is essentially an on-rails racing experience. In order to build up speed, turn and jump, you'll need to  and this is quite a flight of fancy for Nintendo  play the bongo jets strapped to your character. The Nunchuk represents your character's left hand and left bongo, while the Wiimote represents the right. Building up speed is achieved by busting out the move known in Wii circles as 'milking the cow' (alternate moving the Wiimote and Nunchuk up and down to hammer both bongos) but you only have to do this until you hit top speed, at which point you can concentrate on weaving through the fields of barrels and enemies on the courses. Take a hit, however, whether by running into an obstacle, being snapped at by a shark or being attacked by another racer, and you'll have to work those udders to get back up to speed. Steering left and right is achieved by yanking up on the Nunchuk and Wiimote respectively, while to jump you must pull sharply up on them both. Yes, it's a big bongo fest and no, it doesn't make any sense.   It all adds up to a unique control scheme which can be quite fun as you're frantically jiggling the Wiimote and Nunchuk, but that ultimately isn't smooth enough to be taken seriously. Not that this is a game that's meant to be taken seriously of course  it's definitely pitched at a young audience, but the simplicity to simply pick it up and play it isn't there either.    One of the only decent animations in the game kicks in when DK right hooks a shark. Pow!  Indeed, young players have to take a number of other things into account. As you'd expect, the game has an array of pickups, but very few of these are adequately explained or intuitive to use, and very few seem to have any tactical use. (Oh wow  it's a monkey with a mini-helicopter strapped to his back! Aargh  there's a bird flying around me pecking at me: how do I get rid of it? Eeshk! I just got reamed by some weird pineapple thing!).     There's also an attack button which can be used to hit opponents who get close and to punch through wooden barrels. And then there's the 'Wild Moves' system. Every 50 bananas you collect on the course gives you a speed boost power-up which is executed by holding back on the Nunchuk analogue stick then releasing. You can stockpile a number of speed boosts, and there's an interesting combo system associated with it too  each enemy, opponent or wooden barrel that you run into while the speed boost is still active extends the boost, so there's the potential to chain together a sequence of take-downs to keep boosting. It's a great idea but ultimately just highlights the game's shortcomings  it's simply too clumsy using the bongo-based control scheme to deftly manoeuvre through hazards like steel barrels and TNT barrels to hit the wooden ones. The few times you nail it feel good  and it certainly makes collecting every banana you can worthwhile, but ultimately the controls aren't reliable enough for this to be the gameplay icing on the cake that it could have been. And again, it's another element that the intended audience probably won't even be aware of.   Good? Not particularly. Okay at best.  Compounding things, it seems that the design team equate 'more crap on the courses' with 'harder'. True, but in this case it also means 'less fun'. Some of the later courses  such as the Temple courses and the Cosmic Highway (think Rainbow Road but less fruity) throw constant winding turns and paths littered with obstacles at you then expect you to enjoy trying to muddle through with controls that aren't quite up to the job. Thankfully many of the courses are still quite fun, and DK fans will get a kick out of leaping into barrels above the course to be shot along an alternate path, taking an obligatory mine cart detour or hopping aboard a swordfish or stampeding rhino.   While the seven 'themes' from which courses are constructed include all the hoary old platformer archetypes  ice/snow world, lava world, jungle world and so on, we have to say that the world design is very nice indeed. Technically the visuals are a long way below what you'd expect from a modern videogame but the art team has still managed to build a number of enchanting environments. In one level you may be skimming across an idyllic island chain before plunging into the depths of the ocean, surrounded by giant whales, schools of fish and a sunken ship. In another you'll swoop up the side of a snow-capped mountain range before careening down the other side, just above the powdery snow upon which monkeys are skiing. Monkeys! Skiing! As if knowing they were onto a good thing, the team also packed in monkeys waving from beside their igloo village, monkeys bathing in a hot springs and even a monkey adventurer climbing a sheer cliff face. Sure, they're hideously blocky sprites but it's still charming. Because they're monkeys.   Furry heaven. Theres nothing drastically wrong with Donkey Kong: Jet Race, but the gameplay really doesnt gel as a whole. The games appeal will be very limited for older gamers, but younger players may find the mechanics too convoluted. So who, then, is this game for? Pretty much the only slice of the market we can think of would be furries. Not only does the game have an extended cast of lame DK-related characters (Funky Kong? Give me a break) but it also has a mode called Candys Challenges, starring perhaps the most disturbing female videogame character ever, Candy Kong. Does the idea of a lipstick-wearing gorilla in a tight shirt and cut-offs who blows you a kiss from in front of a pink heart frame when you beat a challenge turn you on? If the answer is yes then this may be the game for you.", "date": "Feb 1, 2008"}
