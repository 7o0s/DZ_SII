The simple, effective game play that roped in millions of fans since the pixilated frog's arcade debut in the early 1980s didn't necessarily need any changing or updating, but that's what Frogger Puzzle provides. Instead of crossing a busy highway and a perilous river, now Frogger must navigate a series of rather bland mazes constructed out of cubes.   Players must hop through as many mazes as possible without sending Frogger to his doom by mistakenly jumping through a hole in the floor. That's actually not very difficult to do. The holes are big and black against a labyrinth of colored cubes. Jumping into a hole is more the result of hitting the wrong direction on the d-pad than clever maze design.   I tested Frogger Puzzle on a Sony Ericsson 710, which has a bright display that excels at making mobile games look better than many have any right to. Frogger Puzzle actually looks kinda blocky on the display, as if the game was stretched to fill the dimensions of the screen. The game plays a looping tune that is completely inoffensive, but not exactly catchy either.  Frogger Puzzle just doesn't need to be downloaded. Fans are far better off just seeking out the original Frogger and downloading that on to their handset than this bland hopping game.", "date": "Nov 16, 2005"}
