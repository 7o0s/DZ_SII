Developed by Sega's Smilebit team (the Jet Set Radio Future folks), this baseball game successfully combines a fast-paced design with many of the required baseball elements into a really great portable package. A few corners have been cut here and there in the development cycle, but Baseball Advance is a real king of the mound for the 2002 series. Features Four gameplay modes Four baseball stadiums All MLB teams and players Battery save (one season) Only for Game Boy Advance Baseball Advance isn't based on any existing Sega baseball game released for other systems, so don't expect a Game Boy Advance version of GameCube's Home Run King or the Dreamcast's World Series Baseball series. This is an original game developed specifically for the GBA...and it's a class act all the way through. It's very cut-and-dry in features, though...the design team slimmed down Baseball Advance to a great-looking and playing game of baseball with an extremely short list of gameplay modes. You've got Exhibition, Season, Playoff, and All-Star...no batting practice, no homerun derby, and no multiplayer modes. The game features all the teams and the current roster of MLB players...but there are only four stadiums to play in. At least the fields you can play in are complete; Fenway, for example, has a fully functional Green Monster in left field, so right-handed homers are a little harder to slam out in Boston. The overall design of Baseball Advance is more action-based that simulation based, so games are quick-paced, snapping through all nine innings with no real lull in the gameplay. Some baseball games concentrate more on the hitting game than the fielding game, but Baseball Advance has a great balance of the two.   Smilebit created one of the most creative, intuitive, and functional batting interfaces ever developed in a baseball game, borrowing elements from past Sega baseball games to create Baseball Advance's real gameplay star. To hit the ball, batters must maneuver the cursor within the batter's box before the pitch, guessing where the pitcher's laying down the ball. The cursor's size is determined by the ability of the player...so Barry Bond's cursor is absolutely massive compared to, say, Randy Johnson's. If the cursor is near the target area of the pitch, the cursor will automatically zero in on the pitch, making it easier to hit the ball. Players actually have to start charging their swing during the pitch by holding down the A button...letting go will make the batter swing with the strength determined by the power bar at the side. So, charging a swing too early or late will end up having a weaker connection to the ball. Hits can be somewhat directed by moving the cursor slightly off-target...but this is a skill that's a bit hard to master.   Pitching is a simple matter of point-and-shoot -- each pitcher has its own series of throws: fastballs, sliders, curveballs, and it's simply pick the throw and toss it into the strike zone. As the game goes on, the stats on each pitch will reduce...and you'll notice a frequent number of wild pitches. So it's important to keep an eye on your pitcher and swap him out when he's letting up one too many dingers.     Fielding in Baseball Advance is almost equally strong as the batting. The fielders can dive to reach for a distant hit...but pulling off this move will slow down their reaction time (not to mention cause an injury if the option is turned on). Controls out in the field are also extremely intuitive, keeping the action to the basics: push in the direction of the base (right for first, up for second, left for third, down for home) and hit the A button. The computer does a good job auto-selecting the right fielder for the current play, only goofing up the occasional play. The biggest gripe is trying to judge how far your off-screen outfielder is from the ball, since the screen keep the ball in the center during a pop-fly...so you have to blindly run to where you think the ball will end up. This is slightly unfair, and could have been remedied if the camera just scrolled to the spot on the field during these plays instead of following the airborne ball.  The game's battery-backed season mode is pretty in-depth for a Game Boy Advance game, but it doesn't record everything. In Season Mode, you pick one team to take through the 162 game season...the mode will track your team's batting and fielding statistics for each player, but only for your team. It will, however, track statistics for the single top hitter and pitcher on the opposing teams. Sorry, folks...no make-a-player or player trades in Baseball Advance. Baseball Advance is graphically excellent, especially during the pitching/batting interface. Batters are rendered as super huge and super detailed sprites with fluid animations in several stances. During plays, the game switches to usual overhead view, and here the graphics are slightly above average...but at least the player sprites have character: they breath heavily, they jog to a stop after a sprint. These little touches add that much more charm to an already solid baseball package.  The one crusher is that link cable play didn't make it into the final version of Baseball Advance. Strange, too, since this is the first Sega-developed Game Boy Advance title without this feature implemented. Sports games are always better against a human opponent, so the lack of any multiplayer support is sorely missed. But the single player modes are definitely good enough to stand by themselves...the omission of link cable play just knocks a couple ticks off the overall review score, that's all.  There's plenty of room for improvement if Sega wants to update the series for 2003...but this game is excellent as is. First-time sports series are always tough to get right in their debut, but even with a few quirks and omissions in Sega's design, Baseball Advance is one of, if not the best handheld baseball games yet developed.", "date": "Mar 20, 2002"}
