Regardless of how many flops of Wham-o Frisbee Golf proportions debut each year, the slate of family oriented titles due out every quarter is a mile long.  The general public's got money to burn and corporate bigwigs know it.  And Sierra, of all contenders, has been itching to plunder the untold riches of this non-computer savvy demographic.  Yet although Professional Bull Rider won't bring home the bacon this season, another product on their docket very well might.  Maximum Pool, an overall enhanced version of the undeservedly overlooked 3D Ultra Cool Pool, is a treat from start to finish.  Despite its colorful, family oriented presentation, you won't find a better simulation of the table sport on shelves, with the possible exception of Interplay's soon to be released Virtual Pool 3.  Sharks fending to lay hands on their custom-made cues can quench their thirst in one of the many available variants which range from run of the mill flavors such as Eight Ball and Basic Billiards to more exotic fare like Cutthroat and Snooker.  Also preferred for your pleasure are ~cool~ games which introduce arcade-like elements into play.  Unsophisticated, yet fairly enjoyable examples include 24 Cents and Chameleon Ball, wherein balls are assigned values corresponding to pocket change or shift colors when struck, respectively.  Poker's somewhat more entertaining, as competitors pocket balls with a strategy in mind, namely to collect the best five card hand.  Finally, there's Rocket Ball and Mad Bomber, two special spins on traditional pool that incorporate explosive effects into the equation.  Chances are, whether one relates best to these fun filled diversions or the authentic billiard selections, there's something here for everyone.  Play couldn't be more simplified, thanks to an idiot-proof interface.  All you've got to do is right click to instantly shift the camera angle to a position, or select one of the default views.  While observing the table, it takes naught but a left click and drag to bring the cue ball target cursor into the desired position.  Dotted lines branch off from the reticule to show the path numbered balls will take if struck from the current position, though expert players can turn this helpful indicator off for greater challenge.  Once the angle and position of a shot have been indicated, merely pull back on the mouse and send it lurching into forward motion at a speed concurrent with the amount of power you desire to expend.  Having gotten the hang of it, single or multiplayer match ups shouldn't last longer than 20 minutes.  Frankly, while non-gamers will welcome the talkative computer personalities they'll encounter, stalwart fans of computerized sports will be nonplussed by the digital dweebs.  No worries, though, since a gag order can be slapped on blabber mouthed teens, thirty-somethings, and Buddy the dog in the options menu.  Insofar as the patronizing speech and sound effects may not face a warm welcome from hardcore hustlers, the audio quality's still of the finest caliber.  A 3D visual approach that's both as zany or authentic as desired reinforces the title's whimsical mood, lending it a sense of casual accessibility that most billiard sims can't reproduce.  Tiny animations for flame, coin, and character video clips also enhance the realistic aspects of the title's aesthetics.  Those who frequent smoky, acrid-smelling pool halls in the middle of the night in search of seedy looking tablemates aren't likely to get the most from Maximum Pool.  If, however, you're a member of the camp that enjoys a friendly game of billiards on a regular or sporadic basis, it's a must buy.  As a whole, this program captures the spirit and charm of casual competition marvelously.  Sharp graphics, brilliantly modeled physics, and a pick up and play interface come together in a wonderful package that'll evoke more oohs, ahhs, and pearly white grins than a behind the back masse' shot.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
