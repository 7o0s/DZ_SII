But now 2D, Murdoc, and his compatriots have set their sights on the smallest screen -- mobile -- for their latest conquest. The groups first offering is the clever retro collection of mini-game called GES (Gorillaz Entertainment System), a fusion of current Gorillaz-style animation and blocky Atari 2600 graphics. It's visually arresting, and almost makes you overlook just how shallow the games behind the pixels really are.   Now, that's not necessarily damning, but it does limit the game's appeal beyond the group's fan base. I can appreciate a collection of mini-games as much as the next gamer -- maybe more so, actually -- but even this game offers just too little for its download price ($7 on Cingular!). And if there's anything worse than a cheap shallow game, it's an expensive shallow game.   Each Gorillaz member has their own mini-game. Lead singer 2D gets a boxing mini-game where you must tap an action key to smash a punching bag. The game is about timing the wind-up and the follow-through. Noodles gets a simple action game, where you must use either high, medium, or low blocks to repel pixilated objects. Murdoc stars in a riff on the classic Breakout, but instead of a paddle, you bounce the ball off of the guitarist's sizeable codpiece. Finally, you play a version of Hungry-Hungry Hippos with drummer Russel grabbing cookies as fast as possible to stuff in his gob.   The problem is that you pretty much see and experience everything there is in GES within ten-fifteen minutes. The animations are cool and fun to watch at first -- especially Murdoc using his pelvis to break down walls -- but there isn't that much variation to them. The game play ramps up in difficulty the longer to stay in it, but that's still not enough to keep boredom at bay for long.   As mentioned, the game definitely has a cool look to it. I count myself as a Gorillaz fan, and enjoyed seeing the group on my mobile. But I think I'd get more enjoyment out of animated wallpapers than these very basic mini-games.  Style rarely wins out over substance in my book, and GES is another case of just that -- fun flash, but hardly filling. Now, I know that I gave I-play's Skipping Stone a great score and it's only a one-button game, but there is a certain rhythm and feel to that game which is just missing here. The game mechanics serve the license, and do so just barely. Again, it's a clever little goof that only a few dedicated fans might want to check into, but if Clint Eastwood is still just the name of a badass actor to you, then move along.", "date": "Jun 13, 2006"}
