{"name": "Dead or Alive", "name_review": "Dead or Alive", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/03/28/dead-or-alive-5", "text": "It's been such a long time since a game in the American market has challenged Namco's Tekken series that I almost don't know what to say. Dead or Alive is a startlingly good fighting game to come out of a company that's best known in the PlayStation market for Monster Rancher and Stackers. If it weren't for the fact that Tekken 3 is coming around the corner, Dead or Alive would have a good chance at dominating the 3D fighter market for some time.  The PlayStation version is based off the original Model 2 arcade game, but goes far, far beyond that. The level graphics have been totally reworked to the extent that it looks very little like the original, with new moves, two new characters (Bass, the wrestler, and Ayame, the new bonus girl), and a whopping 84 costume total, it's a game that offers a lot for your money.  Graphically, it's one of the best-looking games since Tobal 2. The Model 2 graphics have ported over to the PlayStation better than they've ever been on the Saturn, and we suspect Sega would be in a much better position today if it just developed its games on the PlayStation. The character models are smooth, realistic looking, and impeccably animated. You'll be hard put to find an edge that isn't supposed to be there. Of course, the women have few, if any sharp edges, but that's on purpose. If eye-candy's your thing, Dead or Alive has got it in spades.   The fighting system is the closest to Virtua Fighter you're ever going to get on the PlayStation, and after playing Dead or Alive for a while, you're really going to appreciate the Sega fighting system. Unlike Tekken, DoA only uses three buttons -- hold, punch, and kick. While it may seem simple, the number of moves and counters come off much easier and instinctively than any other fighting system. Control is lightning-fast, and at no point are you going to lose because your character was just standing there.  The hold button is probably one of the best additions to the fighting game, enabling you to use counters and reversals as components of your moves aresenal, rather than simple combo or throw breakers. As a result, DoA's fighting feels so much more realistic than anything on the market.  Unlike most other fighting games, the character mix is a decent variety, and all feel like real contenders. You have your standard characters like Kasumi (fast but weak) and Jann Lee (the Bruce Lee clone), but you also have some of the world's best strong men -- Bayman and Bass have the power without the sloppy sluggishness you get with Street Fighter's Zangief or Tekken's King. Everybody has some amazing signature moves, and they'll stand out even without the benefit of flashy fireball graphics. Even if their character designs aren't so memorable, it all meshes together so well that everybody will have different favorites.  The only gripe with Dead or Alive is that it's still just a fighting game, and somewhat dated at that. Although the fighting system is almost brand-new on the PlayStation, it's been used time and again on the Saturn, and the lack of a side-step is frustrating since it's a standard feature for most fighters today. The costumes and bouncing breasts are fine, too, but they don't actually contribute to the gameplay except to add temporary novelty and libido frustration to the typical gamer. Only the most frustrated or obsessive gamer (in Steve Frost's case, both), to actually get all the costumes. After spending so much time in development, Tecmo might've at least added on a few more play modes, like Tekken's Force and Ball mode.  The gratuitous sexism aside, Dead or Alive is a polished product that pushes Tecmo to the front of the fighting game, hot on the heels of Namco for the title. This is one game you'll definitely have to try and buy. However, if it wants to compete with the big boys, the company'll have to realize that plain old fighting just ain't enough any more. But after seeing this game, Dead or Alive 2 is looking better and better.", "date": "Mar 28, 1998"}
