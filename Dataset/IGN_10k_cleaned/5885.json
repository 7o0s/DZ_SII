The complications of full golf, from wind speed to putting a little English on the ball to good curse presentation, make mini golf a more ideal rendition of the sport for today's gen on handsets. And JAMDAT's self-titled JAMDAT Mini Golf offers up an excellent representation of why putt-putt works so well.   For one thing, it's easy to get right into the action. The learning curve is non-existent, as there is only one club to choose from and the courses are quite manageably sized. Before taking your first shot, you can pan around the course if it stretches beyond the limits of your screen. Once satisfied with your lay of the land, you can attack the green at will.   Your little golfer lines up shots with a handy dotted line. If your golfer must step between you and the ball, he/she becomes invisible so the line of sight is not impeded. When you have the shot you want, press ~OK~ to call up the power meter. Stop the pulsing strength meter to decide the power behind the shot and watch the little ball rip across the course. The set-up is so desirably uncomplicated that anybody can play, and after a few tries, start doing quite well.   We dig the way the holes are set-up. Some of the early holes are easy affairs without much interference, but later challenges can be attacked from multiple angles, revealing a nice element of strategy. Sometimes, JAMDAT Mini Golf feels more like a puzzle game than a golf game -- and that's a compliment. The hole designs are great, thanks not only to the smart lay-out, but the clever Tiki theme that covers the screen with totems, volcanoes, and bowing high priests.   In fact, the game itself is so good it's a huge disappointment when you complete the eighteenth hole only to find out there are no additional courses. Sure, you can play the same courses over and over to hone your skills -- which is good fun for a few sessions -- but we just wish there were more holes. Other mini golf games have managed to squeeze in more real estate, and since JAMDAT is usually one of the benchmark companies in mobile gaming, the relative brevity of JAMDAT Mini Golf is downright quizzical.   JAMDAT Mini Golf does have a pass-the-phone multiplayer, but no online game. This is something of a disappointment, too, but with many mobile gamers still just getting their feet wet with multiplayer -- it's exclusion is not felt as harshly as it will in a hopeful sequel.  Due to the ease and speed of play, JAMDAT Mini Golf is ~over~ before you know it. Yes, you can replay the course for better scores -- and trust me, I did -- but I really wanted another eighteen holes. Even if they were offered as a download to keep the game file size down, there needs to be more holes for the experienced mobile player. JAMDAT Mini Golf is a great pick-up-and-play game, just like their bowling series, and I suspect it will earn a large audience. But with more content, I think it could have been even larger.", "date": "Jul 16, 2005"}
