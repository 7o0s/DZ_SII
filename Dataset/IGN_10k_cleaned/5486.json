This arcade classic is just as treasured today as it was two decades ago, and while this mobile port isn't perfect, it's still a nice celebration. You are behind the wheel of the Interceptor, hunting spies but using sneaky gadgets like machineguns and oil slicks. Everything you remember from the original has made the transition, from rolling into the back of the red trucks to the cars with the little spike things on their hubcaps.   Spy Hunter looks solid. The sprites are very reasonable approximations of the originals, and despite being shrunk down for the decreased real estate, they look quite crisp. (Far better than the bartender in Root Beer Tapper.) The classic Peter Gunn theme was missing from our Nokia 6620 test drive, but THQ Wireless promises it can be found in other versions of the game. If fond memories of this classic still linger, if you can still hum the theme, then Spy Hunter is the download for you.", "date": "Feb 12, 2005"}
