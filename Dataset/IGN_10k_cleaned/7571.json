The villains and conflicts in the individual shows don't work when all the characters come together, so a new plot has to be thought up. In the case of Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island, the premise is saving the entire universe (something that may be a bit too much for the likes of Spongebob). This epic quest is portrayed in a decidedly unepic way, and the game is a pretty generic platformer, that does the minimum needed to make an average kids game.Spongebob Squarepants, Timmy Turner, and Danny Phantom have all been transported to a mysterious island. Some weird looking crab guy informs them that they are the chosen ones and it is up to them to save the island, and subsequently the universe from the evil Mawgu. But first the gang has to get to the volcano at the center of the island. Seems like it should be no sweat, right? There's a kid with super powers that can fly, and another kid with fairy godparents, getting to a volcano shouldn't be a big deal. I mean, it's not like it's going to take five levels of platforming and beating up shrub monsters to get there, right?That's right, Nicktoons: Battle for Volcano Island is another drawn out platformer. Except this one is slightly more bizarre than others. As the creepy old crab guy informs players at the start, each section of the island is blocked by a gate that can only be unlocked by finding the three crystal keys. Players acquire these keys by finding weird bushed with giant animal heads, and having Cosmo feed them tasty snacks. Then the dog/dolphin/monkey-head bush will vomit up the crystal, a powerup, or occasionally a little tornado, just to keep you on your toes. The bush part is the majority of the touch screen portion of the game. Players tap the bushes to get Cosmo to feed them. Since the game spreads across both screens, the strategy comes in getting your character in a position that makes the bush appear on the lower screen.Each of the three main characters has their own strengths and weaknesses, and players can switch between them at any point in the game. Certain sections in the levels require a specific character. For instance, Timmy is the only character who can double jump, so he can reach some of the higher ledges, and cross the wider chasms. I found it a bit difficult to gauge which character to use at some portions. Standing on the edge of a ledge, it wasn't apparent if it was just a double jump problem, or if the other side was at a lower level and I should use Spongebob to float. The map that shows up on the pause menu isn't very helpful either, since it's small and not very detailed. Things like that cause some unnecessary deaths.Dying doesn't seem to be a big deal in the Nicktoons world, since there are no lives to be lost. I just started back at the beginning of the level. I didn't even lose any of the coins, or crystals I collected.The platforming is, for the most part, solid. It's not very inspired or interesting, but I've played worse. Each section does have a boss battle, and the bosses are varied enough to be somewhat interesting. Some of them require alternative methods to the normal punch-until-they-die method. In the jungle level, the huge tree monster threw nuts that bounced around the level. By juggling the monster's nuts (there's a phrase I never thought I'd write), players could take out the boss and the minions that kept sprouting up. It's not much, but it was semi interesting, and this is a kid's game afterall. To spice things up, there's a fruit catching minigame after each level. Players have to catch fruit, by maneuvering a character of their choice around, avoiding spiney fruit and animals that try to attack. The points don't seem to do anything though, so I'm not sure what the purpose is.Each character gets a line of voicework for the story, along with a few small phrases they say during the gameplay. A lot of the character's lines, are not what they're saying in the text boxes. It's weird to be reading one thing, and hearing something different. Plus, the choices for the one line, is boggling. Why would anyone think that the one thing Danny Phantom gets to say is ~Hey, there's that weird crab! Let's hear what he has to say,~ is a good idea?Nicktoons: Battle For Volcano Island is not just a licensed kid game. It's a multiple licenses kids game, with a weird plot, and forced wackiness. Still, it does what it's supposed to do. It offers a standard platforming experience, with multiple characters that kids love. The game is just really unimpressive, so unless this is a present for an eight-year-old that I constantly watching Nickelodeon, it's probably best to pass.", "date": "Nov 14, 2006"}
