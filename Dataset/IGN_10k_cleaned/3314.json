Panzer Claws sees you commanding US, Soviet and German armies in skirmish, multiplayer and campaign modes and there are a number of scenarios that draw their inspiration from historical events, even if under closer examination there are some inaccuracies.   The game is essentially a real time massed unit strategic effort, with a few supply options, but basically no resource management at all. The focus is very much on leading what are often fairly small forces into battle and making it through to the end of the day when the particular map your are fighting on has been cleared of enemy units.   Graphically this is never going to be the sort of game you show to your mates with a view to impressing them with the power of your new PC or graphics card. The use of night and day transitions is nice though and even though the engine was used in older games like Earth 2150 the visuals aren't quite  risible even if they are tired. That said the scalable isometrically viewed visuals do get the job done and there are some decent animations and most of the tanks look pretty close to their real world namesakes.   There are German tiger tanks, American Shermans and Soviet T34s as well as a host of other tanks, AA units, infantry types, and armoured cars. The little models look pretty much like their real world namesakes even if you generally wouldn't really want to play the game in the close up zoom mode, as it obscures the action.   The gameplay leans pretty obstinately towards the tough end of the continuum and RTS gamers who have been used to C&C style tank rushes with easily replenishable forces will find themselves in for a rude shock. In Panzer Claws your forces are quite limited in size and particularly in the campaign mode you will find you will run out of units quickly if you do not attack your targets with a methodical and well-calculated approach.   That said there are some obvious tactical considerations that you should get the hang of and once these are a part of your approach you will find the game isn't as hard as it first appeared. Panzer Claws adopts the tried and tested ?paper / rock / scissors / banana skin' approach where each item has a natural foil. Well to be sure we aren't sure about the banana skin element, but we just watched the three stooges on DVD, so we couldn't help ourselves.    Assaults are the trickiest manoeuvres in the game and even with superior numbers and firepower you can turn your column of tanks into giant smoking BBQs very quickly if you don't think things through properly.   Tactically you have to be flirtatious with the enemy. Tempt them with a nice column full of juicy targets and then quickly whisk your prized assets out of range setting yourself up in a defensive cordon in readiness if the enemy sends out a scouting force to see what you are up so. Sometimes this approach will lure the mobile enemy units to follow the scouts and you will be able to divide and conquer the enemy force. Sometimes this ploy will fail entirely and you will have to win by either outflanking the enemy position and trying to reduce the number of units they can use to fire at your force simultaneously.   Airstrikes can also help a lot in breaking up enemy positions, but they are very limited in number and once you use them you usually won't be given any more air support.    However the one thing you have to do well is use hot keys to divide your forces up into groups of unit types and then use the right unit type to concentrate fire on a particular enemy. For example armoured cars are great at turning enemy infantry into pizza stains, but will themselves be dish of the day if they are stupid enough to go up against tanks. However infantry can be pretty good at killing tanks, especially when aided by decent anti tank gun emplacements or tank destroyers.    So you have to make sure you aren't constantly wasting your time attacking the wrong unit type with a particular group of units.     There are other strategic considerations too. You can sometimes be lucky enough to travel with a repair vehicle, which can be a real boon as this crane tank can repair just about anything, effectively allowing you to keep all of your units that have survived a particular battle fresh and without any damage. If you don't have a repair unit things get far tougher and you will have to possibly rely on captured vehicles to bolster your numbers when your forces have lost some armor. Unrealistically infantry are completely adept at capturing enemy tanks and vehicles and can instantly operate them with real skill. Infantry also often have a chance of killing the occupants of an enemy vehicle, while leaving the AFV relatively unscathed, making vehicle captures a significant part of your strategy.   Ammunition can be a real headache in the game as all of your big guns require a regular supply of ammo if they are going to be any more useful than as giant bulldozers. Ammo is provided by a supply truck once you have also secured a supply dump and you will find that you will have to often pause your attack just do you can resupply your forces. This unfortunately slows everything down as you muck around with the supply truck and break up the flow of play. Stopping the fun so your delivery vehicle can bring up more shells is also awkward with the truck sometimes not behaving as it should. The enemy also doesn't seem to run out of ammunition, so this element is really just a time waster for you. It adds nothing more than annoyance to the gameplay.   If you aren't the patient methodical type you might find Panzer Claws frustrating. Attacks frequently have to be stalled while you regroup and resupply. You must also regularly indulge in feints and scout missions so that you know what you are getting into before you commit your whole force and these all take time too.   However this more time consuming and patient playstyle isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just depends on your personal taste. If you are a turn based hex wargamer you will probably find Panzer Claws to be a lot of fun. That said the game doesn't do anything that is particularly special even if it has most of the bases covered. Skirmish mode is pretty slow paced too, even if you can still have some pretty decent battles with larger forces than the campaign game.If you aren't the patient methodical type you might find Panzer Claws frustrating.
