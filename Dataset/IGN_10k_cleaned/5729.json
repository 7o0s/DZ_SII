{"name": "Psychonauts", "name_review": "Psychonauts", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/02/psychonauts-2", "text": "Tim Schafer has a loyal legion of fanboys for good reason. The creator of PC classics Full Throttle and Grim Fandango is one of the most innovative game designers in the industry. Previously, Schafer worked at LucasArts, but left the company a half-decade ago to start his own company, Double Fine Productions. After a long journey that involved multiple publishers and a slow development process, Psychonauts has finally landed on store shelves.  You take on the role of Raz, a young psychic who sneaks into Psychic Camp in the hopes of becoming a famed Psychonaut. If Raz's dreams are to be realized, he'll need to find a way to accomplish this in a single day, as the camp counselors (all great Psychonauts in their own right) can't allow Raz to stay at the camp indefinitely. Fortunately for Raz, his father won't arrive until the next morning and there's mischievous happenings at the camp.  When Raz discovers that the students of Psychic Camp are being abducted and their brains taken in the middle of the night, he has no choice but to save them all by entering the minds of various adults -- both good and bad -- to discover the source of the abductions. Using a bevy of psychic powers, Raz battles the dark forces inside numerous minds as he travels through the psychic baggage of camp counselor's, psychotics and a lungfish. Yeah, that's right, a lungfish.  Campers Gone Wild Psychonauts is, at its core, a platformer. However, unlike the typical platformers of the current generation, this is a free-roaming adventure that removes almost every restriction. The camp grounds in which Raz can explore are large and there are a number of hard to reach areas which will challenge your platforming acumen. And if you hope to collect everything in Psychonauts, you'll need to explore every inch of the campgrounds. And there's a lot to collect.  The collect-a-thon begins with purple arrows, which hide inside destructible objects or underground. Collect these in order to purchase helpful items in the Camp Lodge. Then there are the figments. These two-dimensional images litter the interiors of the minds Raz must enter throughout the game. For every hundred you snag, you go up a level -- all the way to Level 100. There are also Psychic Cards, which are carefully placed throughout the campground and each mental level. Collect enough cards and they can be redeemed to earn an extra level (but it's a long way to that magical level 100). We're not done yet. There's 16 Scavenger Hunt items that are very well hidden throughout the game. Yes, that's a lot of crap to collect, but it's pretty entertaining for the most part if a little overdone.   As a platformer, the controls are relatively simple. There's a single hand-to-hand attack button and hotkeys dedicated to using Raz's various psychic powers. Each power must be earned, but cover the standards of the psychic world, including clairvoyance, levitation and telekinesis. You can map any power to these three buttons on the joypad, but since you need to use a variety of powers in each level, you'll need to enter the menu regularly to swap out powers, which can get a little tiresome by the 10th hour. I found keyboard and mouse control a little better than a joypad, simply because managing the various psychic powers is easier with a keyboard and the control is actually pretty good.  No platformer would be complete without some platforming and Psychonauts has plenty. Along with the typical double-jumps and bar swings, Psychonauts adds a great trick thanks to the power of levitation. With this power, Raz creates a mental bubble he can ride on. This super ball allows him to bounce higher and move faster. While in the air, the press of a button turns the ball into a balloon which can be used for gliding. This is easily the most resourceful tool in the entire game.  While I certainly enjoyed much of the platforming aspects, I must admit that by the end of Psychonauts things were degrading from fun to frustrating. There's no ~smart zone~ where, if close enough, Raz will grab a ledge or bar. You have to be very exact and when it comes to the platform-heavy elements of the final level, this becomes increasingly problematic. There are times where you'll keep jumping at the same ledge a half dozen times before Raz finally grabs hold. It's these little things that slowly drag down what is otherwise one of the most refreshing and original adventures games of the past five years.    Mental Make-Up Psychonauts' true genius is displayed when Raz enters someone's mind. Each mental level is tailored to that specific character. When Raz enters velvet painter Eduardo's mind, his costume changes to match the velvet world. Eduardo is tormented by a bull, rampaging through the streets with an uncompromising rage. Another level has Raz playing in a board game where he continually shrinks, at first to manipulate the board and then to attempt to recruit pieces for the game and lastly to enter their homes for exploration.       The best level by far is when Raz enters the mind of the mutated lungfish. It turns out the lungfish is more afraid of Raz than anything else. Because of this, Raz is actually a giant within the lungfish's mind and the level proceeds with Raz tearing through Lungfishopolis as the Godzilla-like Goggalor.   Each mental arena isn't just a pretty design, however. Schafer and company went in-depth with the psychology of each character. Everyone has some major mental hurdle they are dealing with and in order to proceed, Raz must solve these mental roadblocks. These serve as mini-stories within the larger piece and work nicely within the framework of Psychonauts.  Things won't be so easy for Raz as each mind has censors which hunt down thoughts that don't belong. Raz, of course, is one such thought and the censors are determined to take him down. Don't fret though, as just about every enemy in Psychonauts is practically mindless and fairly easy to defeat. As with much of Psychonauts, the censors are a clever idea for the first half, but become tiresome old news in the final hours of gameplay.  Fortunately, each boss is just as unique as the levels they inhabit. While every boss battle relies on pattern memorization, it's just great to see enemies that properly fit each level.   Laugh Until It Hurts. Ow. As much fun as I had with the gameplay, it's the humor of Psychonauts that really makes it worthwhile. The first half of Psychonauts is unbelievably funny. After noting that Goggalor is in search of his ~girl friend,~ our hero Raz begins muttering about how he really isn't sure that he's exactly dating her yet. The rebel leader of the lungfish looks up at Goggalor and says frankly, ~I only meant that she is a girl and that she is your friend.~   The only problem with making a funny game is that the minute it stops being funny, it becomes glaringly obvious. The last few hours of Psychonauts, while dotted wth some humorous moments, just isn't as off-the-wall laugh-so-loud-you-wake-up-your-girlfriend funny as the earlier moments. It almost seems as if Double Fine ran out of gas or felt the game needed to be a bit more serious in the later hours. In either case, there's a noticeable lack of laughs which is unfortunate, because part of what makes Psychonauts endearing is its humor.  What, is She Funny or Something?  Actually, Psychonauts is an attractive game, even if it's best described as having ~a lot of personality.~ Though some of the texture work isn't that hot and Raz isn't exactly overflowing with slick animations, the environments are vivid and original. Though I miss the boring gray walls of endless buildings and rehashed environments seen in just about every first-person shooter, I just love the look of Psychonauts. Each level is so unique that there's little that could be re-used from one level to the next. There's absolutely no sense of repetition here and each environment perfectly fits the situation. Art is about more than hi-res textures and specular highlighting -- it's also about design and Psychonauts has design out the wazoo.   When I wasn't dazzled by the original levels, I was getting an earful of the fantastic score. Of course, more important than the background music are the voices. There's not a wrong note in the voice-acting, something few games can claim. The highlight, again, are the lines from the lungfish of Lungfishopolis. I'd move there in a heartbeat. Psychonauts starts off with a bang. The first half of this game is easily one of the most enjoyable I've had in the past year. But as is the case with many humorous games, the laughs begin to fade in the home stretch and in the end Psychonauts started to wear on me. This is an inventive game that's a bit too easy and not quite as polished as it could have been. Sure, it's not a 10, but this is still a game I highly recommend to anyone who likes to be entertained. Though Schafer has shied away from sequels in the past, I hope Psychonauts proves to be the exception, as a second go could turn in a truly classic game experience.", "date": "May 2, 2005"}
