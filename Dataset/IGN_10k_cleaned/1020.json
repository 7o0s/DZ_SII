Lounging on its lofty perch, the company is one of the handful of remaining industry players with the cojones to bring games of this breed to retail that still manages to turn a tidy profit.  But alongside power comes the responsibility to wield it wisely, and Dreamcatcher has yet to exercise due diligence when determining which European products to import.  Consequently, the stage has been set for Daydream Software, the Swedish crew behind Safecracker (aka Nutcracker), to get a second run at American pocketbooks.  Greetings, secret agent man.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to break into the Tower of London and replace the crown jewels with fake replicas.  There are a few matters you should be aware of, however, such as the alarm system, garrison of armed guards, and the fact that no one's been able to pull off the feat in 500 years.  Succeed and your country's thanks will be with you.  Fail and we'll not only disown you, we'll also force you to play the ~non-linear~ adventure (read: Myst clone), Traitor's Gate, all over again.  Lest I forget, military regulations demand that we provide you with a cyanide pill, in case no alternative to the latter option presents itself.  Non-linear, in the vocabulary of Daydream's head-honchos, equates to fun, unrestricted adventuring.  Translated into the vernacular, it means that you'll be stumbling around for days with no earthly idea as to what to do next.  Four CDs contain over 100 objects, 100 puzzles, and 100 hours of gameplay if the box is telling the truth, but chances are you won't stick around long enough to verify the claims.  Alone, bewildered, and sorely unprepared for the task at hand, you're left to wander through a complex of monumental size with capture and death imminent at every turn.  Some say situations like this make a game suspenseful, others persist in the belief that it's just a royal pain in the ass.  Care to hazard a guess as to which category I fall into?  Hold up a minute, bloodthirsty readers, because it wouldn't be fair to condemn the title without judging the merits of its puzzles.  Keys must be nicked from sleeping guards, random engravings photographed, combinations deciphered and strongboxes pilfered for their goods.  A sizable portion of the puzzles can be solved in a logical manner, though many require the kind of foresight that only the designers have been blessed with.  For this reason above all, Traitor's Gate can only be recommended to gamers with a passion for mind-numbing brainbusters.  But who knows... maybe some of you take it for granted that everyone knows not to push the big button until they've set up their multi-tool, unscrewed the alarm box and stuffed a chiclet between the connectors.  Heck, the headaches begin long before you'll see most of the challenges on display. Macromedia and QuickTime have joined forces again to make scene transition choppy, load times achingly slow and disc-swapping a frequent occurrence.  In this day and age, there's no reasonable explanation for you to have to play disc jockey and swap CDs non-stop because you want to move from one area to another that's located nearby.  The use of a sewer tunnel maze early on in the game was also totally uncalled for.  Aggravation reigns supreme when you run up against mental blocks after searching for thirty minutes for a way around brick walls and locked gates.  Snazzy gadgets like the crossbow and PDA (personal digital assistant) aren't enough to jazz up the presentation.  Junky cutscenes clash with smooth, 3D objects, ruining any sense of authenticity right out of the gate.  Important objects blend in with useless background clutter, which wouldn't be a bad thing except for the fact that the cursor doesn't always do a very good job of helping you discern one from the other.  The aural selections fall somewhere between James Bond and Alfred Hitchcock in nature, but usually you're greeted with the sound of silence.  Sections of the tower are so quiet that it's tempting to down an order of refried beans and let a huge one rip to see if it'll catch the guards' attention.  Classy as it is to work a reference to flatulence into a review, Traitor's Gate is the real stinker here.  An online hint system or the slightest nudge to indicate the step that must be taken next would have gone a long way towards improving the product's image. Siphoning puzzles and important clues out of a mountain of junk is the real task, putting what you've discovered to good use is merely icing on the cake.  Twenty dollars buys many things, but if used to purchase a copy of Traitor's Gate, peace of mind won't be one of them.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jun 16, 2000"}
