On the other hand, it's not nearly as bad as expected at some other points, which is saying something about a game that, for a while, looked like it was eventually destined for the dustbin.  Mat Hoffman has arrived about six months later than its (his?) original release date, and passed through the hands of two different developers on the way out (or three if you count Neversoft, creators of the original graphics and gameplay engine), so honestly, the game's turned out pretty well, if you take all that into consideration.  What is missing is hard to put your finger on some of the time.  It gives one a newfound respect, though, for the amount of work that must have gone into tuning the control and level design in the Tony Hawk games.  There's a fluidity and responsiveness there that Mat Hoffman lacks sometimes, a neatly interlocking fit between your actions and the environments around them that you respond to.  It's still a sight better than anything else that's been done in this area -- Acclaim and THQ's entries can hardly compare -- but we'll still have to wait for a BMX game that achieves greatness through its own efforts.  Gameplay  The elements that make Mat Hoffman fun are, as you'd expect, the ones that arrive intact from Tony Hawk.  It has Hawk's same quick pace, which is a welcome change from the often slow and clumsy Dave Mirra, and a familiar control scheme that lets you string together a wide variety of tricks.  One gets the feeling that the delays in the game were mainly the fault of the level designers, which obviously left the animators with a lot of downtime to use modeling different tricks.  The trick set is pretty big in comparison to the original Hawk, with a fair amount of variation from rider to rider -- each one has a lot of individuality just in his basic tricks -- and the manual is included from Tony Hawk 2, allowing for much more variety in street combos.  The selection of grind tricks may not seem quite full, but it's hard to come up with more than six common freestyle grinds (icepick, toothpick, double-peg, Smith, crooked, feeble...then what?), but the inclusion of some nice lip tricks (disasters, sprocket stalls, and footplants) helps make up for that.  Consider yourself skilled if you can pull the elusive sprocket grind, too.  The level design, unfortunately, is a mixed bag, especially compared to the uniformly brilliant stages in the Tony Hawk games.  Two developers worked directly on Mat Hoffman, Runecraft and Shaba Games (the latter being the Grind Session/Razor team), and there are traces of what feels like a rescue effort here, strong levels mixed with bland levels mixed with one flat-out horrible level, the New York City park.  The park is huge and cluttered, with hardly any decent lines connecting together all the different chunks of trick potential, and the dark lighting makes it easy to get lost and futz up the collection goals.  It's strange to finally make your way through the miserable thrash that is New York and suddenly find yourself in the game's two best levels, the Treatment Plant and La Habra.  These are both nearly Tony Hawk-caliber stages, with far more interesting lines and innovative architecture.  The cloverleaf bowls in the plant are great for dinking around with vert tricks, and La Habra combines the fun elements of Hawk 2's Philly and Hawk 1's School -- there are nifty street lines and plenty of rooves to jump up to.  Still, though, there's nothing quite up there with stages like Philly, Skatestreet, or the Phoenix downhill.  A particular complaint: the hidden covers (Hoffman uses magazine covers instead of tapes to tally up your progress) are much, much too easy to procure.  In most levels they're just a matter of hitting a single jump and grind correctly, and never is there a challenge on the order of the downhill jam or San Francisco in the first Tony Hawk.  The secret cover in La Habra is easy to land on just by accident, although it's worth noting that the collection goal in that same level (~knock out the satellite dishes~) is probably the best its type in Hawk or Hoffman.  You can always, of course, make your own levels, in a level editor that seems almost identical  to the one in Tony Hawk 2, including the gap tool and multiple start points for multiplayer levels.  Go ahead and give it a shot -- the average gamer could whip up something that's more fun to play than the New York level in a single sitting.  Graphics  The feature set may blend bits of both Tony Hawks, but the visuals in Mat Hoffman are clearly contemporary to the first Pro Skater.  The character models aren't as smooth and robust as those in Hawk 2, the texture detail doesn't compare, and draw-in gets pretty brutal in the more open areas.  While we're on the subject of flaws, it's also worth noting that there are moderate to severe bugs scattered throughout the architecture -- it's quite possible to ride through obstacles, get stuck in polygon seams, and fall right through the walls outside the level in the finished version of the game.  But both Tony Hawks have suffered from similar problems, and it's never a problem that just hitting ~retry~ can't solve.  The character animation does its part to make up for the backgrounds, too, since as I said the animators seem to have used their extra time wisely.  In addition to a strong selection of tricks and variations (square does bike tricks, circle handles body tricks, if you understand the difference), there are some very good crash animations.  There's nothing up there on the entertainment scale with the sack-out bail in Hawk 2, but riders flip and tumble through a good variety of routines, without the weird, boneless slow-motion quality that pervaded Dave Mirra.  Sound  Finally, a category where you don't have to hem and haw.  Mat Hoffman has Tony Hawk 2's sound, essentially, in terms of both music and effects, and hence it's just as good.  The sound of bikes smacking rails and flying away from crashes has the satisfying jangly smack that rings in my ear from crashing my own ride down and again.  The music licensing deserves the most praise, though.  Activision has again refused to fall into the trap of just lining up a dozen random lousy punk bands (no offense intended to the Dropkick Murphys, but I can't help but look in Acclaim's direction, and THQ gets the full-bore evil eye).  Yes, punk is the mainstay genre here, but it's good stuff (including some absolutely classic tunes), mixed with rock, hip-hop, and electronica.  Some of the choices are downright obscure, but it all sounds very good, and the eclecticism makes the original Tony Hawk soundtrack, which was excellent for its time, look awfully limited in comparison. So I love listening to the music.  Did I really enjoy the game all that much?Yes, I suppose so.  Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX is not the successor to Tony Hawk -- those looking for something to equal their experience with that game will be disappointed, probably, especially if they had an appreciation of its finer points.  If you want a BMX game specifically, though, this is the one to buy.  I'd be ready to write off Dave Mirra completely after playing this, if it weren't for the fact I like Acclaim's lineup of riders so much (Cory Nastazio is cool; Troy McMurray is many, many, many times cooler).But regardless of the fun there is to be had with this game, I'm looking ahead to Rainbow Studios and its work on Mat Hoffman 2 for what I hope will be a fresher treatment of the concept. Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX both succeeds and fails by trying to ride Pro Skater's coattails.A note on the score below.  I know Dave Mirra received a higher objective score from Doug Perry.
