Now all I want to do is sit at home and play on the computer. Not only are all of the tables nice and clean, but you can play without having to worry about losing your money to a shark named Lenny.  But first lets look at the superficial stuff. While the game isn't the prettiest game you'll ever see, it certainly does what it does in style. The balls themselves are very beautifully rendered, and yes I know they're just spheres but they still look great. The tables are also top notch, with several different designs in the different pool halls that you will play in during the game.   The pool halls themselves each have a distinct flavor to them that is supplemented by the background graphics that include stuff like old tires and tools in the garage level, to the armor, fireplace and stone walls of the Loch Lomond. Different music also plays for each pool hall to add that extra little bit of style that is really nice to see in a comparatively simple game like this.  But if you play pool at all, then you are probably painfully aware that the game is actually anything but simple. There are so many little tricks of the trade it's silly. But luckily, all of you rookies and geometry failures out there will be able to get some help with the handy dandy tutorial videos that give you some of the basics and more advanced concepts of shooting pool. The videos star the lovely Black Widow of pool Jeanette Lee, which should keep you watching them over and over until you really get the point.  After watching the videos and practicing a little bit, you can jump into the millions of different games available in the package. Okay, maybe millions is a little exaggerated, but there certainly are more than I knew what to do with. I hadn't even heard of half of the types of pool games that are offered. It's a good thing that there is a nice manual that gives the lowdown on all of the different games and the rules that go along with them. They've got everything from nine ball to snooker here. It'll keep you going for quite a while.  And once you start actually playing? It's a whole lot of fun and actually could serve pretty well as a billiards course. It's probably cheaper to learn with this game than it is in the actual pool halls. This way you can keep practicing until you get it right. And get it right you will. The physics in this game are very impressive. It plays just like the real thing. Well... the real thing on a nice table. The games don't simulate all of the beer stains and little pieces of dirt that would be on regular bar pool tables, but it certainly gives you the feel of how it would be to play with the big boys. Balls bounce when hit funny, go flying off the table when hit really funny, and make all of the little jumps and giggles that you expect from a real game.   The controls couldn't be easier either. All it takes to make a shot is moving the mouse to aim, and then holding the s key while you move the mouse back and forth to simulate a stroke. Want to put some English on the ball? Just hold the e key and a dot on the cue ball will show you where your cue will strike. It's actually much easier to control the strength of the stroke than I originally thought it might be.  All of this adds up to some great gameplay that will keep you entertained for a long time since you never get the same game twice. There are also a few different modes of play to add more fun to the mix as well. My favorite was the career mode where you start off working the low money tables and work your way up in the ranks to battle the masters of the game. You can, of course, pick a career in any of the different game types and set the difficulty level, which really makes quite the different if you're as crappy at pool as I am. There is also quick play where you can choose whatever table you want to play on, set the number of players and all of that jazz. Internet play, tournament modes, trick shots set ups, and statistic tracking round out all of the great features that are included here.   Basically if you like pool and want to learn a bit more about the game this is a good way to do it. It won't replace the real thing with all of the physical anomalies that are on an actual table, but it will definitely feel like the game should be if all conditions were perfect. It's really a great game, a whole lot of fun, and easy to get into and play for short or long periods. Before you know it, you'll be running tables with the best of them. Once you find a straight cue and stop drinking anyway.  -- Dan Adams      Want to share your opinions with the world?
