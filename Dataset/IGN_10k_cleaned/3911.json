Disregard this warning at your own expense.  Ok, for those of you still here, the concept of Cold Zero: No Mercy is similar to that of Commandos or Jagged Alliance, but with a few differences that immediately stand out.  First of all, Cold Zero is much more of an urban crime drama.  Second, instead of commanding a squad of soldiers or mercenaries, you ~control~ only one character.  I put ~control~ in quotes because the actual scheme for directing your hero could've been much better than it actually is, but we'll delve into that in a second...   Set in a gritty unnamed city, Cold Zero is the story of John McAffrey, a disgraced SWAT sniper.  During a hostage situation, John disregards orders and takes an opportunistic shot to eliminate a target.  Unfortunately, his shot ends up killing a hostage, resulting in his banishment from the force.  Trying to make ends meet, John tries to become a private detective, but his past continually catches up with him, leaving him with few cases and mounting debts.  (Sorry to digress, but is there ever a successful private detective in a story?  I don't think there's been one since The Thin Man movies.)  In an attempt to solve his money problems, John takes one fateful case to rescue a kidnapped man that inevitably crosses the mob boss of the town.   See, that man just happened to be a major drug dealer in the town who was going to be ~taken care of.~  It seems that the mob in John's town, like Vito Corleone in The Godfather, has a personal aversion to drugs and the drug trade, considering it to be a dirty business.  (You heard me correctly, that oxymoronic statement is on par with that of honest politicians.)  While not pleased with the fact that the drug dealer got away, the Don was impressed by just how efficient John was during his mission.  Deciding that he's not going to whack him, the Don instead decides that John is indebted to him for his lapse of judgment.  Pressed into employment as a new enforcer for the mob, John performs numerous errands for them, including an attempt to stop the flow of a new deadly drug that's been hitting the streets called Cold Zero (hence the name of the game.)  I guess the more people that do drugs, the fewer people the mob can shake down for money, and that simply won't do.   Run from a top-down 3D isometric perspective, players use the maps provided by John's secretary, Jane, to navigate through sixteen dangerous levels.  Apparently plugged into a spy satellite or GPS, John's maps provide accurate info about the location of every enemy and each friendly human on each stage, which helps when you're planning your assaults.  John isn't the most mobile of protagonists.  He can't jump, he won't be able to climb most items unless they're specifically designated with a ladder or some other scalable footpath and he can only hide in certain areas that provide him with a reasonable amount of cover.  What's more, direct action is not always the best approach to succeed in missions; in fact, most face-to-face confrontations often lead to John's quick demise and a trip to the reload screen.  To succeed, effective use of Cold Zero's stealth system is essential to accomplishing each stage's objectives.  The stealth system is a combination of both visual and auditory recognition on the part of your enemies.  Guards and other foes will patrol chokepoints on each stage, investigating things that seem out of the ordinary, like fallen comrades as well as firing at John on sight.  To decrease his visibility, John can put on camouflage to blend into his surroundings or shoot out light sources like lamps or streetlights to give him the cover of darkness.  Similarly, players have to be aware of the amount of noise they make as they try to traverse each level.  Simply walking or running down a street or through the wilderness can make so much racket that every fool with a weapon will descend upon you.  To avoid this, John can cautiously walk or sneak upon surfaces to silently dispatch his enemies.   Taking out opponents on each level is more than just a way to eliminate threats to your safety.  Killing an opponent can net you a number of items, including cash, jewelry or any one of over a hundred weapons.  What's more, you also receive experience for each person you take out, which can be used to augment John's skills.  Among other talents, players can make John stronger, more accurate with a weapon or more adept at sneaking and hiding.   While the plot and certain mechanics of Cold Zero sound unique, the implementation of a lot of its features comes off more half-baked than innovative.  First of all, the RPG-lite feature of enhancing John's skills doesn't work as well as the designers intended.  With the exception of pumping up your strength stat to carry more weapons or loot to pawn at the pawnshop (whoever thought that selling porno mags would be valuable?), the other stats are relatively useless.  Working on your ~Fighting~ skill, which is supposed to aid your aim, doesn't remotely strengthen your chances to take out enemies with a weapon.  Neither does specializing in a firearm, which seems to randomly miss nearby enemies and kill long-range ones.  Besides that, the technology skill, which is included as a way to pick locked doors or repair damaged weapons, actually becomes more of an afterthought.  You can readily find the keys you need on most enemies that patrol pathways, and you find so many weapons of the bodies of killed foes that you don't need to really worry about fixing a broken firearm.    Considering the preponderance of weaponry, you'd hope that the combat system would be somewhat better than the skill system.  Unfortunately, this is just as flawed, especially considering the uneven favoritism given to the enemy.  For some unforeseen reason, your opponents have a peculiar ability to shoot through walls, boxes or other solid objects while John doesn't.  That little fluke quickly makes the load screen your best friend, regardless of how many quick saves you make.  Even worse is the exceedingly clumsy reloading of any weapon.  Not only is it extremely loud, alerting anyone within (and sometimes outside of) earshot that you're nearby, it also takes a while to do.  If you're in a safe or a cleared area, this is fine, but as you sometimes get swarmed by numerous melee and ranged fighters, this is detrimental to John's health.   Add to that the fact that switching weapons is not at all a smooth process, and you find yourself often firing while retreating, hoping that your aim just happens to be better than your foes at that moment.  On top of the combat issues is a rather stagnant formula of gameplay.  Even though each mission has different objectives and separate goals to achieve, you'll nevertheless find yourself creeping behind enemies, blowing away threats and looting bodies.  Although you aren't required to eliminate every marked threat, it often seems like you're forced to degenerate into a killing machine instead of a stealthy presence.  After a while, that starts to get truly boring, even if you get to defuse bombs or rescue hostages.  (Personally I don't know if I'd give John another hostage situation considering his history, but I guess he needed some kind of redemption.)  The basic point that gets driven home is that strategy isn't really necessary, just a quick trigger finger and a bit of luck.   Even if you can forgive some of these flaws, the truly unforgivable issue within Cold Zero has to be the abysmal camera control.  Typically the camera's focus is locked upon John as he goes through each level.  Granted, players are able to pan, tilt and zoom the camera independent of the character to scout ahead to potential trouble spots, which would be a great concept if strategy was necessary.  Instead, players will quickly find that they are required to constantly manipulate the camera to gain any kind of perspective on the action.  This may not seem like that bad a problem until you find yourself caught in a firefight with bullets coming at you from some off-screen position.  By the time you actually find out where the attack is coming from, John's already suffered a lethal case of lead poisoning.  That's right, back to the load screen...   Graphically, Cold Zero does manage to deliver a number of varied environments, including mines and wilderness landscapes.  What makes many of these settings stand out are the number of detailed items found within each level, such as a magazine stand that is packed with magazines or the individual pieces of flotsam floating in a spillway.  Additionally, many of the other items, like boxes, barrels, crates and other items can be destroyed during gunfights, adding a dynamic feel to the environment.  This is especially true when targeting light sources, which quickly plunge areas into darkness when they're extinguished.  There are a few graphical downsides, such as the clunky, sometimes robotic, animation that both John and his enemies seem to share in their movement.  Additionally, cutscenes can take at least fifteen seconds to manually skip through, which, for a title that forces as many reloads as Cold Zero will upon players, is simply inexcusable.  Oh, and one final side note to developers:  if you're going to use text for newspapers in an opening movie, please, please write it yourself instead of blatantly plagiarizing the New York Times Sports page!  Instead of made up text or even gibberish under a ~Hostage Killer~ headline about John, you can clearly read how Tiger Woods did at a golf tournament.  A little verisimilitude, please...   With sound playing a major factor in gameplay, you'd expect that the effects that were carried out within the game should be well done.  Fortunately, Cold Zero doesn't let down in this department, with plenty of solid effects work done for weapons, items and environments.  Break apart a wooden item and you'll hear the remnants clatter to the floor.  Fire a silenced gun and a non-silenced one and the radical difference is ear-opening.  While a little bit of a giveaway to an incoming attack, the music does a nice job of remaining subdued during normal action, rising to a fevered crescendo during gun or fistfights.  Unfortunately, the vocal acting, while not horrendous, isn't necessarily a stand out either.  Just like I said in my disclaimer, if you're not a fan of action/strategy games, you're probably not going to dig the numerous reloads you'll have to go through to get into the story of Cold Zero.  Overall, the plot is a creative one and some of the ideas behind the game were interesting.   On the other hand, you'll most likely have to be a serious fan of the genre to put up with some of the shortcomings of the engine and less than perfect control and battle scheme.There is one feature that I didn't specifically speak about: multiplayer.  I tried to find external servers to play against other Cold Zero users, but there simply weren't any running while I was reviewing this game.  My guess was that owners of the title were still slogging their way through each level and trying to get used to moving John through each level.  LAN play does host up to 16 players, and does run at a pretty solid rate, although the same control issues apply, so you'll have to ask yourself if it's truly worth it to play against people with clunky movement and firing controls.", "date": "Sep 16, 2003"}
