{"name": "Freekstyle", "name_review": "Freekstyle", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/10/freekstyle", "text": "Adding one more sport to its growing ~Big~ library, Electronic Arts has teamed up with Page 44 Studios (cooperatively ported to GameCube by Hypnos Entertainment) to produce another adrenaline-infused offering that introduces the same outrageousness to the sport of motocross that SSX did to snowboarding. Properly named Freekstyle, the title brings forth the fastest, most tricked out, over-the-top MX racing ever. It is by no means a simulation, and it does nothing to attempt to be. It's complete arcade action with a few real-world ties to the sport of MX. Big air, huge tracks, and break-neck speed await those interested.   The only question that begs answering is does switching out snowboarding for motocross work as well? Freekstyle is undeniably entertaining, but if you've had your fill of the SSX series, there's much to consider.   Features  Bigger-than-life MX racing lets you do the impossible Nine different venues, featuring some of the most outrageous freestyle terrain, like Rocket Garden, Crash Pad, Monumental Motoplex and the ultimate big air course, Burn It Up Eight different riders with their own unique attitude, style and bikes, including Mike Metzger, Brian Deegan, Leann Tweeden, Stefy Bau, Clifford Adoptante, Greg Albertyn, Mike Jones, and Jessica Patterson More than 100 tricks to pull off for bonus points and boosts, such as the McMetz, the Executioner, the Superfly and the 360 Completely surreal track designs twist, turn, and dive through fantasy environments Multiple game modes include Circuit, Freestyle, Freeride and Race, featuring split screen two-player support Build up boost and a freekout meter to race ahead at unbelievable speeds An energetic soundtrack features well-known artists such as Dry Cell GameCube enhanced visuals -- proper filtering and a solid framerate Surround sound support including Dolby Pro Logic II   Gameplay Freekstyle was brought forth in the wake of the successful SSX franchise, an exaggerated take on snowboarding that lets gamers perform impossible tricks on larger-than-life tracks. In cooperation with Page 44 Studios, Electronic Arts has applied the same fundamental ideas to the sport of motocross. It allows you, as the player, to race in hardcore, Mad Max type races, pulling off impossible tricks and catching monster air along the way. Performing a No Hander over a 600 ft. drop is nothing but child's play in Freekstyle.   Very much in the mold of SSX before it, there are a host of modes including Circuit and Freestyle competition in addition to Freeride and Single Race for practice and two-player. In contrast to its big brother SSX, however, the Freestyle mode is completely separate from the Circuit. Essentially, Circuit mode is for season-type racing, which you have to participate in if you want to open up all the cool tracks. As you progress in the season, you will open up a few bonus tracks for Freestyle in addition to the standard one that is unlocked from the start. This contrast is quite important to understand because where you could focus on trick-based racing, earning bronze, silver, and gold medals in SSX's Circuit mode, you are limited strictly to racing for first through third place to unlock new tracks. Yes, the same rules of the race have returned to Freekstyle. You must place in the top three spots over three separate heats on each track to move forward. If you falter at all, you have to retry. There has been some improvement to this, however. No longer will you have to start over at heat one; races can be retried infinitely until you're successful. This is a huge stride forward for the design.     Naturally, pulling off tricks is integral to winning each race. Everything is combo based, so you might string together a No Hander into a Superfly and modify it subsequently. Freekstyle requires a total of five buttons; four for tricks and one for modifying. This posed some problems for SSX Tricky on GameCube, as the developers failed to offer up enough control options. Thankfully, Hypnos has come up with a robust set of schemes for a total of five different options. All of them let you pull off every trick in the book -- there have been no sacrifices from the PlayStation 2 version. The reason this works so well with Freekstyle is because there is only one four-button (simultaneous) trick for each rider, and you can only use it at certain times. The concept is that you can build up a Freekout meter by successfully landing tricks (which builds boost separately). Once it is built up, you perform a four-button combo to push yourself into a state of Freekout, where you move faster and can perform the uber-trick. Overall, the performing tricks works very nicely, and if you're willing to experiment a little with the control setups, there are a few that work even better than the default.       In sum, Freekstyle for GameCube has jumped over a few of the hurdles that SSX Tricky's debut on the system revealed. It has all the modes, it looks stellar, it handles perfectly, and nothing has been sacrificed for the port, even if it comes a few months late. With a robust set of options, two-player support, and a ton of bikes and tracks to unlock, we highly recommend you check it out. Whether or not it's purchase-worthy boils down to a little philosophy. The biggest issue to consider is that in our opinion Freekstyle's use of the MX license isn't a versatile enough substitute for the original. Careening down the painted, surreal mountainsides on a snowboard and catching big air works really well. You can string together innumerable combos and it just feels right. Trying to do the same thing on an MX bike, however, feels a bit more sluggish and, ultimately, is not as entertaining.   Beyond that thought, Freekstyle is one of the best MX-themed titles around. Its quick, arcadey style is instantly gratifying and can easily prove addictive. Only the carbon copy approach to the SSX license, lengthy Circuit progression -- three heats to advance, and lack of four-player support should sway buyers.  Graphics Hypnos has done a wonderful job porting Freekstyle to GameCube. Everything the engine did on PS2 it is doing better on GCN. The framerate is quick and smooth at 60 frames per second, and the harsh edges and flicker of the PS2 iteration are gone. Certainly the game engine's strongest point is its ability to draw huge, stretching 3D environments. Nothing about Freekstyle is small or average in size. Tracks take you climbing into the skies and diving down 600-foot drops. To compliment this, the gaping environments are overlayed with gritty texture sets that bring out that ~post-apocalyptic~ feel.   Overall, it's a good-looking title. Hopefully next time around the developers will be able to dig into the GameCube hardware more deeply to implement some more impressive texture and lighting effects. Also, the lack of progressive scan support was disappointing, as it's an easy implementation that goes a long way to improve the experience for HDTV users.   Sound Freekstyle's encourages keeping the music track loud. Bands such as Dry Cell offer up metal tunes to compliment the spikes and leather attitude of the game. The selection will probably seem a bit stale to those hip to the music scene, but it's certainly better than original compositions gone bad. The sound effects work is slightly above average, where you can hear heavy clanks of metal when your bike connects with the ground after catching big air, for example. Engine noises are also high-pitched and buzzing, very similar to what you'd hear in real life. The developers have even gone the extra mile to include environmental effects such as echoes in closed-in areas.  Even better, Dolby Pro Logic II can be activated for a more immersive surround soundscape. As a whole, there are no major audio flaws, but it certainly isn't doing anything you haven't heard before. Like the review says, Freekstyle brings the ~Big~ control scheme to the GameCube very nicely with no sacrifices. For this much, I was very pleased to play Freekstyle, as I've grown tired of sloppy ports where the developer is unwilling or unable to put enough time into it to make it work. Freekstyle is very playable using the GameCube controller, so you're not taken out of the game world with frustration.As for the gameplay design itself, I've been rather fond of it since I heard of EA's plans to apply the SSX concept to motocross. The end product proved to deliver on this, but I overestimated its appeal. In the end, over-the-top snowboarding proves to work better than motocross. That's not to say Freekstyle isn't any good, though. It most certainly is an above average arcade racer, complete with a nice selection of characters, bikes, and tracks. And, on GameCube, if the controls of SSX Tricky proved too frustrating for you, Freekstyle will feel more comfortable to you. Be absolutely sure to check this one out. Whether you purchase or rent will largely depend on your taste for the SSX-style racing.", "date": "Sep 10, 2002"}
