It found a niche audience of puzzle solvers who didn't mind zany puzzles and poor production values. In comes Crystal Key 2. It picks up right where the original left off. This sequel serves up another helping of crumby graphics and tepid puzzle solving.   Crystal Key II forces you to assume the role of Call, a naive wanderer who talks like he's auditioning to host the kiddy show Blue's Clues. Call's father saved the universe in the original Crystal Key, and now the role of galactic savior has fallen to you. The introduction provides a brief rundown on events from the first game and sets up the sequel.    You find out Call's dad vanquished Ozgar, an alien whose career goals included universal conquest and domination. Peace lasted for all of five minutes. A brand new menace plopped down on your home world of Evany and turned its lively denizens into brainless drones. The game starts with a mysterious woman coming through a portal right in front you. Before she has the chance to talk to you, two soldiers come through the portal and drag her back in.    How mysterious and exciting, no? Call finds a key and a journal dropped by the mysterious woman. Upon reading the journal, Call discovers that other worlds have been inflicted with the same disease as on Evany. Turns out some invisible race of aliens forcibly hypnotized half the galaxy. Call takes the key and opens the portal to chase down the soldiers. He lands on a desert with no map, no weapons, and worse, not a clue. And the interface doesn't help the gamer get any more oriented than Call.   Sadly, the story fails to gather any momentum. The urgency created in the first five minutes of the game dissipates as soon as you enter that first portal. The kidnapping witnessed earlier doesn't launch you into a galactic game of cat and mouse. Instead, you spend hours wandering around alien locales and talking to oddball characters you will care nothing about. The story feels pretty thin, and much of it comes through poorly written dialogue when talking to a few key characters, and not by anything you do directly.       You play through Crystal Key II as a floating camera. At least that's what it feels like. Anyone who has checked out the inside of a car or hotel lobby through QuickTime VR will feel right at home in this game. Unless you hate QuickTime VR, in which case Crystal Key II will probably make you puke. If spending 10 hours panning solving puzzles through a QuickTime plug-in sounds fun to you, then stop reading this review and buy this game now. Inventory shows up as a bar at the bottom of the screen, but only when you right click the mouse. In ~inventory~ mode, you can drag items into the middle of the screen to solve puzzles.     The puzzles in Crystal Key II play a very small role in the game story wise. Most of the puzzles serve only to obstruct your journey, not to reveal new truths and help unravel what little mystery the game holds. Puzzles in Crystal Key II form a mixed bag of idiot-proof ~no brainers~ to some ~head scratchers~ that defy all sense and logic. Many of the puzzles require you to bounce around the game world on a jet pack in search of items. Early in the game, for example, Call needs to find a tool to open a nearby pipe. Instead of finding a wrench or similar tools nearby, you fly halfway around the hemisphere to a spot you visited earlier in the game to pick one up.   What's more, you could clearly see the tool lying on the floor the first time you visit that area. But the interface doesn't let you pick it up until you need to solve the puzzle later on. Call me a lazy adventurer if you want. But geez, game designers took care of this kind of flaw two decades ago. What's more, the game fails to let you know why you need to solve certain puzzles in the first place. You don't run into locked doors and then hack them to gain entrance. No, that would just be too logical for this game. One such ~open the door~ puzzle in Crystal Key II has you growing flowers and arranging them around the door posts to open it. Make sense? Not a damn bit.   With all this lunacy, you would expect the game to balance things out with wicked visuals. Unfortunately, the graphics in this adventure lack flair and overall creativity. The aliens you encounter look like Star Trek rejects and the locales you visit appear dull and lifeless. Most of the game lacks animation of any kind whatsoever. In its place, Crystal Key II dishes out a series of still pictures. And not artsy high resolution pictures either. We're talking fuzzy, 800x600 resolution shots of some of the most uninspired alien worlds ever created. You travel to the other end of known universe, but it looks like Arizona. You visit ~otherworldly~ beaches and villages, yet none of them serve to immerse the player anymore than a blurry vacation photo. The game industry blew past these visuals back in the early 90s.       The sound further distances players from settling down in their game chairs and enjoying the game. Most of the characters in Crystal Key II sound better suited for Sesame Street than a ~serious~ adventure game. A lack of realistic sound effects (or any sound effects) makes playing this game a sad, solitary affair. For the most part, you're simply clicking around town with nothing but your computer fan to fend off silence. You can't even buy into the illusion you're not alone through the sound of people talking in a market, beach, etc. Not only does the game look dead, it sounds dead to boot. Having said that, what little music the game does provide sounds decent. It even fits the forlorn mood of the game.    Fans of the original Crystal Key might want to pick this game up. I would even recommend this game to indiscriminate puzzle fanatics with mounds of 20 dollar bills lying around. Just one of those paper bills will buy hours of puzzle solving entertainment. Anyone other than super rich puzzle freaks should avoid this game. The interface has a high probability of making you nauseous and the story lacks depth and excitement. What's more, the puzzles are either too easy or lack any kind of reason.", "date": "Apr 10, 2004"}
