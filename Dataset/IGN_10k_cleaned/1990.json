Every American is required to watch it, we think, or else risk being banned from the country for being a Communist.  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is a genuine phenomenon -- both culturally and TV-wise. It's stretched into three or four nights a week on the ABC schedule now, so it's almost impossible to miss. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: 3rd Edition, the new game from Buena Vista Interactive, is about as close to the TV show as you can get on your computer.   There's the music from the TV show, which is pitch perfect. So if you find the tunes from the TV game show infectious, you won't be disappointed with the game's soundtrack. It's spot on.   Graphics in the game are pretty good. You see the ~hot seat~ just as you would on TV. And all the appropriate swirls and movements of the TV graphics are there, too. It's a little odd, though, that the game's pre-rendered graphics exhibit occasional slow-down. You'd think that because the CPU's not really generating any of the graphics real-time, you'd never have any slow-down. But hey, what do we know?  And then, of course, there is Regis. Regis Philbin, host of the TV game, is here in all his ... ahem ... glory. If you find Regis annoying on TV, let's just say you'll find him unbearable here. The things that make him annoying on TV are multiplied by scores in the game -- his annoying quips, his voice, his interruptions of your thinking process -- there's plenty to go around here, and Buena Vista must have paid him to say as much as possible. Let's just say, ~He's Bonkos!~ (Seinfeld fans will understand that).  The game works just like it does on TV. Answer a series of questions with increasing difficulty to win more and more cash. You start at $100 and it roughly doubles all the way up to $1 million. Answer 15 questions correctly in a row, and you are the newest millionaire.  And yes, the early questions (the $100, $200, and $300 questions) are just as stupid as they are on TV.  Get stumped along the way, and you have three ~life lines~ to help you out -- again just like the TV show. There's the 50/50, which eliminates two of the wrong answers; the phone-a-friend, which lets you call someone for help; and finally, the ask-the-audience ~life line~, in which you can poll the audience about their belief of the correct answer.  ~Life lines~ are handled a bit differently in the game, of course. The 50/50 is pretty much as you'd see on TV. But the ask-the-audience option is actually a poll of randomly selected people that was inserted in the game. It still works as it does on TV: You see the results as if Regis had polled the audience for you, and their answers are shown on a percentage basis, with the most popular showing as the highest percentage.  ~Phone-a-friend~ is the one rather bizarre option in the game. If you elect to use this, Regis will ~call~ someone for you, someone he usually identifies as ~his friend.~ You'll hear a voice as if he's actually talking to someone, and they'll act as if they just answered the phone. After some usually bad jokes, the person will give you what they think the answer is. Sometimes they're right, and sometimes ... well, let's just say I've lost more than once on a phone-a-friend's advice.  Questions in the game are fairly difficult as you progress through the money brackets, with the toughest ones obviously linked to the higher dollar-value questions. But as we played through the game a few times, there was a little too much repetition for our taste. Even after playing three or four times, we already saw questions from previous games as we played again.  The game does allow you to download new questions from the Buena Vista site. Unfortunately, when we did this, there was only one new question set available for download, something called ~Phrase Craze.~ And it wasn't very good. It was simply a set of questions having to do with various phrases. For instance, ~If two things are different they are said to be what?~ Well, if you had seen the four choices, you would know immediately that the answer was ~apples and oranges.~  As for multiplayer, there's really not any to speak of. The only multiplayer action included in the game is if two people want to compete for the right to play the game. Then you can do one of the famous ~Fastest Finger~ questions to see who will be the one to try for the million. ~Fastest Finger~ works just as it does on TV -- you are given four things to put in order -- usually chronologically or geographically -- and the fastest one to come up with the correct answer wins. The only problem is one player must use the 1, 2, 3 and 4 keys, and the other must use the 7, 8, 9 and 0 keys to input their answers. Things could get a bit crowded on the keyboard.  The longevity of the game would have been much better served had the developers also included some kind of modem play or network option where you can play against other people. Then again, when it comes right down to it, Millionaire is basically a single-player experience, no matter how you slice it.  For all its worth, Who Wants To Be A Millionaire: 3rd Edition is a good diversion for a few hours of trivia fun. Unfortunately, the annoyance of Regis and the repetition of questions mean this diversion doesn't last too long. If you're still hungry for trivia, you'll be scrambling for your Trivial Pursuit board after this.  We did like the disclaimer on the CD-ROM case though: ~You need to get on the TV show to win a real million dollars.~ No! Really? I was thinking if I won the game, someone would just send me a big check.  -- Mike Morrissey  Want to share your opinions with the world?

Despite its shortened longevity, Who Wants to be a Millionaire is a decent trivia game for the Game Boy Color that captures the essence of the game show pretty darn well. Just don't expect any banter from Regis  but maybe that's a good thing.", "date": "Jun 20, 2001"}
