SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman was obviously designed to appeal to the average fan of the cartoon series. My estimation defines them as the five-and-younger crowd, possibly autistic. Though truth be told, its insane simplicity is sure to alienate any ADD-afflicted players, no matter how young they are.   The game consists of about a million fetch-quests, and none of them are very interesting at all. The various levels are littered with collectible coins and pointless odd jobs that don't require much attention to complete. In each of the unique areas of SpongeBob's world, there is a laundry list of tasks to complete-- none of them are fun. Ranging from delivering food to obscure addresses, to finding icons lazily hidden in the boring environments. It's all about as arbitrary and inane as any other platformer game, except that not one aspect of the game provides a compelling reason to push forward and progress through the game.   Clunky controls further mock the experience of playing Revenge of the Flying Dutchman. Pushing SpongeBob about the world of Bikini Bottom has about as much feel and nuance as rolling a tennis ball on concrete, though, the staleness of the controls isn't the worst offense. Even simplistic platform jumping is made difficult by the floaty trot of the Sponge named Bob, and walking along narrow paths -- as is required in some objectives -- is more of an annoying chore than any genuine challenge. In fact, the lackluster controls provide the only bit of challenge to be found in the game, and that's never a good thing.   Seeing that the game is based on a wildly popular cartoon series, it'd make sense that the presentation stayed true to the feel of the show. As far as I can tell, all of the characters are voiced by the actors from the cartoon episodes, adding some legitimacy to the game, but everything from there heads downhill. A few animated FMV scenes are trashed by compression, since someone thought it'd be a good idea to cram the game and its entire dialog onto a CD instead of a DVD. Perhaps the worst damage to the game's presentation, though, is the fact that the game is riddled with loading screens. It's about impossible to walk around for more than forty-five seconds without seeing a loading screen, a significant deterrent to any aspirations of completing the menial tasks of the game.   Developer BigSky Interactive obviously wasn't satisfied with just making the gameplay enormously boring and tedious, hence the painfully unattractive and dull visuals displayed in Revenge of the Flying Dutchman. Though there are but a few glaring graphical bugs, the game's visuals fail to capture the same animated whimsy of the cartoon series. Wide-open environments devoid of much flavor are left barren, though there are a few areas where it looks like someone working on the level design was trying to make things exciting. In doing so, senseless, random platforms and objects are crammed into a few areas, and though the animation of these scenes helps break up some monotony, it all just looks kind of silly. Being based on a cartoon, the game should sport some vibrancy, but low contrasts and blunted colors make the game look exceptionally blah.Anyone interested in purchasing SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman should consider a couple of things. First of all, this game was designed to be enjoyable for young children, and maybe grown-ups with the same mental capacity. Secondly, the tasks and challenges are insanely boring and trivial.To ensure that the game actually gets played, make sure the intentioned gamer doesnt have access to anything better to do, including any video game that is not SpongeBob SquarePants: Revenge of the Flying Dutchman. Yes, pre-school-aged kids will probably get a kick out of the game, though theyd likely be more entertained mowing down prostitutes in Grand Theft Auto.", "date": "Nov 26, 2002"}
