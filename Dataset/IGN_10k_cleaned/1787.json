Simply put, 3D platform games aren't seen very often on the Dreamcast and when they do appear, it's rare that they are as good as the likes of a Rayman 2 and rather take the form of Croc 2 or Super Magnetic Neo.  And in the two latter cases, the classic pitfalls of either difficult control and/or bad camera angles.  So now, comes Kao The Kangaroo Titus's latest venture on the Dreamcast featuring an adorable kangaroo fitted with  surprisingly enough  boxing gloves!  Unoriginal, you say?  Indeed it is, and that's probably Kao The Kangaroo's biggest downfall as a game; we've seen, played and done all the things in Kao over and over again.  Not to say that keeping a ~if it ain't broke, don't fix it~ policy is a bad thing.  And in that matter, Kao The Kangaroo does a pretty good job of staying a simple, platforming title even with the story.  Kao is kidnapped and now must find his way back to his home down under.  Of course, the kidnappers aren't just going to say ~oh please, Mr. Kao, be on your way and I hope our kidnapping didn't inconvenience you in anyway,~ as you'll face all sorts of strange enemies, whether it's lollipop wielding pigs, or broom wielding sailors.  Not to worry, for Kao has an assortment of attacks, where it's his lethal ~Sugar Ray~ 1-2 combination punches, his lethal tail whipping attack, or the powerful ~Power Glove~ special move that homes in on the closest enemy.  The visuals in Kao aren't exactly ~tour de force~ as shown with a wishy-washy frame rate that goes speeds up and slows down depending on how much stuff is on screen as well as what actions our kangaroo hero is performing.  For example, if you're in a cave area with lots of coins to collect and a few enemies on screen, if you whip Kao a full 360 degrees, you'll be able to notice the frame rate drop.  Perhaps it's also because the camera follows Kao's movement to the point where it's aggravating.  A fixed camera that follows the character is fine in a 3D platformer, but with Kao the camera is a bit slow when our hero turns to a certain area quickly, and that can lead to some bad timing especially in precision platforming sequences.  Addtionally, whenever Kao jumps, the camera ~shakes~ as if jumping as well and that gets REALLY annoying.  Though characters and backgrounds have a low polygon count, everything is quite bright and colorful, and it's apparent, when combined with the simple play mechanics, that Kao The Kangaroo seems to be a game made for our much younger Dreamcast gamer.  Of course, I don't think I would recommend this game to any kids I know since the gameplay is too simple and the controls are awkward.  More importantly, the pace of action that Kao moves at is too slow. And when the action does arrive, the controls get really weird.  For example, in almost all the chase sequences where Kao is running down a path ~towards~ the player, the natural control scheme (at least one normalized in the Crash series of games) would be to have the player pushing down on the D-pad to make Kao run toward the screen.  Well, it's the exact opposite in Kao The Kangaroo, where pushing up on the D-pad makes Kao runs toward the player in such chase sequences.  I don't know if they programmers purposely made the controls this way to challenge the player or were to lazy to change it, but it's certainly an awkward way to move Kao.  Additionally, there's some spotty collision detection throughout the game, and I've encountered some bad bugs especially in the hang-glider sequence where Kao actually goes through the ground.  And as stated above, this title doesn't try to introduce anything refreshing in terms of gameplay, sticking with a simple game plan that would've been fine if not for some disturbing gameplay flaws.  As delightful as our cartoony kangaroo is, Kao The Kangaroo just wasn't exciting enough for me mainly because I've played this type of game so many times already.  If the gameplay was solid, then perhaps I could look past that, but with awkward controls and an unfinished feel, Kao The Kangaroo tries to leap just past the standard but falls short of making the jump to the next platform.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC If anything, Kao the Kangaroo is a challenge to get through...but the frustration level is absolutely massive. The main hero may be cute to look at...but he's a real pushover, introducing almost no gaming innovation to the side-scrolling platform genre. It's a game that feels entirely rushed, with poor decisions in game design.", "date": "Feb 14, 2001"}
