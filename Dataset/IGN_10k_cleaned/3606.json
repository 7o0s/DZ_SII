There can be any number of reasons for this: gameplay that becomes repetitive. A lack of game balance that reveals itself only after you've played the product in a certain way. The thrill of first-rate graphics and music, fading away before a third rate release. For me, the original Tropico uncomfortably fits into this pattern of praise followed by dissatisfaction. I played it heavily and lost the glow fairly soon, because the demands on what to build, when and where, felt far too restrictive, and the atmosphere, very thin. There wasn't a hint of the extraordinarily realistic flavor of Jim Gasperini's 1988 classic, Hidden Agenda, a simulation of Latin American rule that both PopTop Software's Phil Steinmeyer and I loved, and the game he told me hem planned to emulate when making Tropico.   So why is the old fahrt going on about the original Tropico at the start of a review about a different game...? I'm glad you asked that, and so politely, too! It's because while Tropico 2 uses the same basic interface and provides a similar kind of island-building strategic simulation experience as its predecessor, I find myself better pleased with the results. Tropico 2 has no pretensions to design-your-own-Latino-culture. There's a more open-ended quality to your progress in any given scenario, and a quirky humor that lives far across town from the white picket fence of reality.   The Premise  You're a Pirate King; or rather, let's call you a Pirate CEO. It's more appropriate, given your task: the construction of a Caribbean pirate island during the 17th century. (However, developers Frog City probably chose the title Pirate King for your leader because it features prominently in that comic opera masterpiece, Gilbert and Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance. To give you some flavor of the work, just remember that Penzance was a Victorian Era seaside resort town.) Other pirate leaders work for you, raiding settlements for captives, and sailing the seas in search of loot. Your goal is to make their lives more secure, offering them the comforts and luxuries that any seaborne sociopaths could reasonably expect. At the same time, you take care of your prisoners, who do all the island labor, seeing to their basic needs while instilling them with a healthy dose of fear.   As with other city-style construction sims, the primary pleasure lies in the choices you make, and the challenges of balancing micromanaged detail into a winning combination. Life isn't simply a matter of sending out pirates to grab money. A lot hinges on pirate and prisoner satisfaction. The two aren't identical, and are frequently at odds. Pirates want food, drink, wenches, rest, hoards, gambling, well-defended islands and a feeling of anarchy, while prisoners thrive on food, rest, religion, fear, and a sense of order in their lives. There are dozens of two and three-tiered product systems to build that satisfy these desires, like Tobacco Farm-Cigar Maker-Gambling Den. You'll have to arm your pirates and their ships, too, since few buccaneers ever sank an enemy by reputation, alone. Which accounts for the Iron Mine-Blast Furnace-Blacksmith/Gunsmith/Cannon Foundry product system: all the sabers, guns, and cannons your crews can manage, produced twenty-four hours a day under this distinctly odd, never-setting Caribbean sun.   Periodically, you send individual ships (six different models, each with its own speed, weapons and crew capacity, etc) to cruise the Caribbean and coastal waters, which are divided into eighteen regions. Only your own region's wealth and danger are well known at game's start, but reconnoitering missions can help. Sometimes your pirates will discover a European colony, or a wealthy trade route. Where cash is likeliest, the fighting will be worst; and while you take no part in the battles, you can at least instruct your buccaneers beforehand to board, pound, or harass the enemy, in order of decreasing danger/rewards. Each crewmember is individually rated for swordsmanship, marksmanship, gunnery, navigation, and seamanship, while your pirate captains are additionally scored for loyalty, courage, leadership, and notoriety. A particularly notorious captain, for instance, will gain more recruits from attacked vessels, and quash mutinies more handily.   You'll have to set policies as well regarding the treatment of ships and captives from their different foreign powers. Spain breathing down your neck because of all those hostages you've taken from their ships? Why not free your French hostages and swear to never attack their ships again? If the French and your island end up in a harmonious relationship, you can declare them your patrons. Once one of the great powers is your patron, the others can never attack your base, if they somehow discover its location. For you don't want to be friendless when a European power finds your island home. It's more misery than even a wizened old pirate like yourself deserves to bear.   Of course, other problems can just as easily shiver your timbers, and call for a new set of underwear. Sufficiently unsatisfied captives might become emboldened enough to escape; and when many of them survive, they'll usually return to lead a mass insurrection. By contrast, your buccaneers are a lot more direct. If one intensely dislikes your rule, they'll simply attack the nearest pirate until somebody dies. (The survivor feels much better about life. The casualty has no complaints, either.) If they all intensely dislike your rule, they'll just kill you and put somebody else in your place.    Tropico 2 provides you with the means to handle these disasters, but they're not pretty. You can pay for your guards to assassinate an especially unruly pirate, or donate money to make him happier. You can order random executions, which makes all your pirates jump with joy; just expect to lose a lot of working captives, with job experience that can't easily be replaced even if you've got a full stockade. You can rig your gambling halls against the pirates, increasing revenue, or in favor of the crews, increasing their sense of self-worth while the island treasury dwindles.    There's a lot more to it, but this will give you a flavor of some of the diverse options at your disposal in Tropico 2. It's definitely not a game that leaves you feeling it lacks detail. There are multiple goals and many ways to achieve them, with strong game balance that we've come to expect from Frog City (makers of Imperialism I and II, and my wife's current favorite game, Trade Empires).   Minor Annoyances  Playing around with this level of micromanagement can be fun, especially if like me, you illuminated medieval manuscripts by hand, back in the 13th century. Hell, even without that kind of strangely obsessive personality, it's possible to relish the elaborate environment and all the control over its contents that Tropico 2 provides.   That said, there are some aspects of the game that could have been made easier to use. As an example, consider the way the game handles skilled captives, the kind you have to kidnap from settlements in order to ~unlock~ new buildings. This is what happens in a typical session: I need a skilled farmer on hand in order to construct a Papaya Farm. (And I need the Papaya Farm in order to feed my pirates. Why else would I want one? These questions of yours will drive me mad, I tell you!) But after the Papaya Farm is built, the skilled farmer can't be found in the stockade, along with the other prisoners. That's because if an appropriate business exists, skilled workers are automatically slotted in to replace standard, unskilled captives; and a good idea it is, too. However, finding that skilled farmer now involves either finding and clicking on every corn farm I've got (usually three or four), and checking out all their workers at each location individually, or opening the Island Log, then clicking successively on Demographics, Captive Demographics, Farming, and finally my skilled farmer. Then, and only then, will the game highlight his presence. It uses a little antique ship's wheel on an arrow over his head, which is a nice touch. But by that time, I'm too dazed to appreciate it.   Of course, it makes sense to have a prisoner jump to the first appropriate job. That saves you the time of personally sending every one on its merry, captive way. But a means to selectively restrict a skilled craftsman to a post of your choice would have been appreciated.   The Interface  In a word (or four), refreshingly simple and effective. Point-and-left-click. Click on a captive, and several buttons will appear that give you a range of in-depth information about that prisoner's background, skill levels, specific feelings, whereabouts, and dialog. Click on a building, and you'll see what resources it absorbs and produces, along with a brief breakout of its finances. Click on a ship to see its crew and mission.   At the far left are two bars. Placing the mouse over them gives the percentage of pirate and captive satisfaction, respectively. I find that the first bar problematic, though. As close to the edge of the screen as it is, my view instantly scrolls if I go just a little too far with the mouse. And speaking of the mouse, Tropico 2 uses a kind of skull-headed arrow. While it's certainly atmospheric, it takes a while getting adjusted to the fact that your current selection isn't what's directly in front of the arrow tip, but rather the exact middle of the arrow's length.   The single most useful tool on the interface is the Island Log. I cherish this virtual book, which contains so much more information than the logbooks of the wonderful Railroad Tycoon series. There's a line chart that rates the progress of every color-coded quality affecting captive satisfaction; you can turn the display of each quality on or off, and there's another such chart for your pirates. There are further breakout charts for each piratical faction, such as the Gentry, who prefer more refined entertainment, and the English, who are identified as ~inveterate gamblers and drinkers.~ (Remember, it's only a game. In reality the British never gamble, and only drink a nastily flavored water called tea.) Want to find out how many buildings you own that increase a pirate's sense of defense? There's a list of them, here. This is also where you go to find a full, dated record of each of your ship's cruises and its detailed results, down to the name of every wealthy captive you took for ransom.    Finally, you can read the extensive Pirate Isle Cyclopedia inside your Island Log. It gives you a ton of game background on each ship and structure you can build, plus any of the pirate captains that may end up working for you. (This is information not to be found in the otherwise fine game manual, by the way.) Tropico 2's Island Log is easily the button I use most on the interface, and a game feature whose depth other strategy titles might do well to duplicate.   Game Options  There's no multiplayer, but then, you wouldn't expect that from a constructing simulation that lets you speed up or slow down time with a keypress, would you? Instead, you can select from nine individual scenarios, and a single campaign in sixteen linked episodes. Personally, I consider these the weakest element in the game. Don't get me wrong; they are extremely well designed. But nine scenarios seems a relatively small number, despite the fact that some of them long and fairly hard. The campaign is fun, but there are no multiple paths between episodes, much less the ability to secure different strategic portions of the Caribbean in personalized stages, each win bringing its own reward (see Warlords Battlecry 2).   Fortunately, Tropico 2 really shines in its sandbox mode. Here, you can customize your island's location, advantages and geographical parameters, captive/pirate stability, the game length and goals. You also get to select one of sixteen created piratical types to represent you, complete with various advantages or disadvantages. For example, Nickolaas van Hoorn gets a number of expensive buildings for half price and keeps them maintenance free; plus he receives a free engineer (needed to construct and run a Cannon Foundry). Enemy ships surrender a little easier when they know he's behind an attack, thanks to his ruthless reputation, but his own ships will almost always attack recklessly, whatever the odds, leading to the frequent loss of crews, weapons and captains at sea.   Alternatively, you can build your own pirate ruler. As in the original Tropico, this involves choosing a background (Once a Captain, Master Gunner, etc), two positive qualities (Diplomacy, Industrious, etc), and a flaw (Lazy, Illiterate, Alcoholic, etc).   Finally, there's a tutorial scenario that makes learning Tropico 2's interface and options very easy to do. A special tutorial character named Smitty appears in the upper left screen corner from time to time with elaborate and useful advice. You can keep him on during the regular scenarios, campaign and sandbox mode as well, in which case he furnishes useful reminders of problems and advantages as they occur. Thus, if your pirate happiness is running low from lack of grog, Smitty will inform you of this as it occurs. You can turn off his repetitive voiceovers yet leave the visual popups, too.   Other game settings involve graphics (resolutions of 640 x 480 to 1600 x 1200 supported), a variety of sound effects, level of detail, and notifications of various important, constructed items.    Humor. No, really.  Tropico 2 isn't really quite the fanciful, laugh-a-minute treat that's part of its promotion. That honor should probably go to the poorly publicized, wonderfully original construction sim, Afterlife, which Lucasarts released in 1996. (Imagine an animated disaster that hits a badly constructed pair of heaven and hell colonies, called The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypso. Yes, the entire game was like that.) But Tropico 2 is less pretentious and more amusing than its predecessor. You can build a Hat Shop, for instance, using a captive skilled hatter to produce scary black tri-corner hats that instantly raise the leadership abilities of whomever receives them from your hands. Peglegs increase the notoriety of pirate captains, and gifts of parrots increase their courage (of course). The multilingual remarks voiced by some captives and crew when you click on them raise a chuckle, and Smitty's own dialog when you really bring in a mint (~Well lift me tail and call me Spotty!~) got a laugh in this household. Nor is it possible to take things completely seriously when one of your pirate captain choices is Cap'n Hook, or when one of the positive qualities you can give your in-game persona includes the ability to raise dead crewmen as skeletons.   What did you think of Tropico 2: Pirate's Cove?   In addition, there are little animated details that you can only see if you zoom in tightly, and watch for a while. A guard, for instance, will accidentally run into somebody, step aside, salute them, then move along; or a trader will stand in front of a Black Market, tossing a coin repeatedly until a crew member passes nearby, and grabs it. It's these endearingly little whimsical touches that will carry you through those times when nothing much is happening on the ground, and you just want to watch your colony in greater detail. The sprites may not be as attractive as SimCity 4, but hey, at least you don't have to worry about nuclear pollution.Strategic simulations can be a delight or a ragged bore, and weve seen an explosion of the latter over the last year. Somehow, the word must have gotten around that this kind of game was an easy way to make a fortune; and just as with RTS and Diablo clones, weve been inundated with dreary wannabes that show little understanding of the genre and absolutely no imagination. Airport Tycoon 2? Car Tycoon? Ski Resort Tycoon? Rock Manager? May they all rest in peace; and if they wont, Ill be among the first to bring a stake and a little holy water.Games like Tropico 2, on the other hand, keep the genre fresh. They remind us all about what makes a good strategic simulation both challenging and fun to play: a strong economic base, a good element of variability in the machine, a broad field of responses to every situation, and the ability to pause and consider your options or examine every corner of your universe. Above all, strategic sims worthy of the name supply reactive engines that provides instant feedback to your actions from the game people you serve and rule, bringing them to vivid life and challenging your deified wisdom. I feel that all of these elements are present in Tropico 2 to varying degrees. It also possesses those characteristics youd want from just about any game, including a strong interface, good game balance, a bit of whimsy, attractively animated graphics and pleasantly anachronistic, modern Caribbean music.In short, Tropico 2 is well worth the investment of your time and money.", "date": "Apr 21, 2003"}
