The game throws three players out the window in favor of its eight-against-eight configuration, for unknown reasons...and the documentation never acknowledges this little quirk in the game design at all, either. Granted, the game lacks any actual league license, so you really don't know if this is supposed to be Arena League, National Football League, or Pop Warner...it's just ~Football.~ Very nondescript, and slightly confusing. Regardless, this game is a better package than the baseball title released under the same Sports Illustrated for Kids license, and is the best game of football on the GBA...but with competition in the form of the absolutely horrendous NFL Blitz 20-02 on the system, that's not exactly saying much. Features Exhibition and Season modes Power-up players after a season game. Link cable support for two players Battery save Only for Game Boy Advance  The game itself utilizes the same game engine that the developers used for its Sports Illustrated for Kids: Baseball product released at the same time...and if you read that review, you'd know that the engine was the game's only real shining element in a mound of crud. The engine is even more impressive in this football design, since it's in action constantly -- the camera perspective is at the familiar tipped/overhead viewpoint popularized by EA Sports' own Madden football series, and the engine provides a super smooth view of the action as it moves up and down the field. It actually ~feels~ somewhat 3D since the engine allows for elements like shoestring and full on tackles, as well as blocked passes when defensivemen get a bit too close to the quarterback. Admittedly, the game speed should have been kicked up a notch, as it feels like the players are swimming more than running.  But compared to the company's baseball product, it's obvious that much more attention was paid to this title in terms of gameplay -- it's far from a perfect game of gridiron, but at least it's a lot more playable than the baseball title developed on this engine. The computer AI is obviously a step in the right direction, both on offense and defense...sure, it makes the occasional odd error in judgment throughout a game, but all players follow the motions after a play's selected, and computer blockers actually do their job when you're rushing down the field. And hey, the ball even has a little bit of physics involved when a punt lands on the ground, bouncing up and back on the grass as the oddly-shaped pigskin usually does. Admittedly, the defensive AI does a bit too good of a job during passing plays, as they'll stick to their man like glue and never ease up...this makes it very difficult to complete passes, since chances are high that a pass to a covered man will have the ball swatted or intercepted.  The game still has the same odd button configuration that plagued the baseball title, a layout that makes playing the game a little more confusing than it should be -- Sennari really needs to stick with what's been established in other sports games when creating the action interface in its own titles. The ~switch active player~ command is the biggest problem in this issue, as it's been placed on the A button instead of the ~secondary~ B button like every other sports game.  And the developer did nothing to boost the abysmally plain and extremely underwhelming presentation to make the game feel more complete and exciting. Plain text pops up after a play to display which player was tackled or completed a pass, though it never says the important information, like how long the run or pass was when it was successfully pulled off. Gamers never know how far it is to the next down until they pick a formation from the downright inefficiently laid-out playbook...the important game data doesn't show up until the play listing appears, and, for some odd reason, there's no First Down indicator any place on the field. The game features the same team creation and season recording modes of SI4K: Baseball, but it only keeps track of eight players per team...players handle both offense and defensive aspects of the game. The stat screen has confusing abbreviations for all of its numbers...couldn't the programmers create a less sloppy layout for the statistics?  One horrible design of the game -- playing the clock is a strategy that just doesn't exist in this game. There are no timeouts to be had in SI4K: Football, and the defense can stop the clock by just sitting on the playbook...the clock will automatically stop after 30 seconds, and the offense can't do anything to hurry up the game to get a few plays in before time runs out. If the player-controlled defense is way ahead, they can deviously sit on the play for as long as they want to waste time.  The difference in detail attention between SI4K: Baseball and SI4K: Football is very much night and day -- I got a little enjoyment out of Football, whereas Baseball was more a chore to get through. This game absolutely requires a ton of work to make it a worthy pigskin title for the Game Boy Advance, but it's slightly amusing in small shots.", "date": "Oct 10, 2001"}
