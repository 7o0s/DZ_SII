It's kind of scary. I haven't shaved, I'm getting zits in all sorts of weird places -- I'm a real mess. Better still, at least I don't look like one of those Kingpin goons after a point-blank debate with a Tommy gun.  And that's where I'll start, Kingpin's look and overall presentation will literally blow your head off. At first glance, the first half-an-hour, or so, I was a little concerned. After playing games such as Half-Life, Unreal, Quake II, games with tons of color and diversity in textures, Kingpin's dark and dirty look was a little bland in comparison and took a little getting use to. However, as you advance through the game, you'll notice all the quiet extras such as subtle lighting effects, highly detailed buildings, beautifully rendered NPCs (especially the ladies), even the rats. It didn't take long for me to overcome my fear of the dark and become completely immersed into Kingpin's dim and cynical world... finding a shotgun also helped.  Kingpin: Life of Crime starts off with a wonderful intro starring one of the toughest black guys I have ever seen (the big boss), I swear it's Ving Rhames, and one of his top henchmen. The two of them are having a conversation about the status of their numbers running scheme, which then eludes to some talk and concern about Nicky's whereabouts, one of big boss' other top minions, which then later eludes to you. A scene showing you after a good ass whoopin'. Not to blow the surprise, but that was what Nicky was up to, beating your ass. And that's how your long and violent adventure begins.  Well, before I get into the game's level design, I guess I should warn those who are expecting a deep and entangling storyline. Let's just say that there's barely enough for you to know why you're killing all these people. Anyway, as I said in the beginning, I had a small concern with this game during the first couple of levels.  The concern was redundancy, not just in mission objectives, but in level design. At first, it seemed like I was just going from run-down building to the next, and all the environments looked sort of the same. It's no secret that every first person shooter plays similarly, find some key, open door, shoot bad guy. But what saves an FPS from that is their level layouts, and through the first couple of missions, I thought Kingpin may hitch itself under the same gross generalization. Fortunately, it's quite the opposite and I just had to be patient. Some levels take place in areas such as metal factories, others are staged in ship yards, some even have you deep down in the sewers. Oh, and how could I forget my personal favorite, the ~Derailed~ level. This one takes place in a rail yard setting. It's dark, it's foggy... and it should be noted that there are trains that will run you over. Surprise! (I swear, I thought those tracks were there just for design). There's even this one area, where there are a series of cars lined up next to each other and you have to weave in between them and hunt down thugs. It's so intense. My suggestion, when you get to that part, hide in one of the cars, and when you hear them come buy, fire a grenade while the train door is in its closing phase. They'll bounce in between the tight passage ways and take out any nasty passerby.  So to answer the inevitable question that every FPS fan always asks, ~Is the level design good?~ In the merry words of Dirk Diggler, I'd have to say, ~Good? It's Excellent!~ I apologize, but you all know me, and you're just going to have to pardon my odd references.  In addition to the awesome level designs, Kingpin boasts some nice looking mean guys...? Seriously, this game has some sweetly rendered characters, the whores look like whores, the hit-men look like hit-men, the bums look like bums. And although there isn't a huge variety of starring baddies (or maybe it's just hard to tell them all apart), there are enough there to please the appetite of any preferred gun -- because they all look the same in the end, shuck-shuck, boom!  One feature that has turned the FPS genre completely around is the implementation of team-play elements. There's nothing better than assigning your team to go one way, to have another team follow close behind, and strategically annihilate your opposing foes -- without loosing any of your damage. This is what kept Kingpin in the higher scores.  Using money that can be found in either randomly placed safes, or on a dead guy, you can not only purchase weapons and ammo, but you can also hire up to two gunmen (or women) to lend a hand. With a press of a few keys, you can have your hired guns follow you in and assist you in eliminating everyone in an area. Or if you're low on health, you can strategically position your two back ups, attract some baddies with some random pistol fire, and lead them to an ambush of death, one by one. Some can even blow up safes and do other things as well. What's really cool is that your hired help isn't stupid. If you tell them to blast something, they'll blast it, when you're running around, they'll follow you close behind, sometimes too close. Here's one of my small complaints. Some of the areas are just too tight in size, and having two big thugs following you around, well, sometimes they just take up too much space. If you go into a small room, or you want to go back down a hallway, those guys just get in the way sometimes and it's quite frustrating, having to walk around and making them follow you and crap. It didn't happen too much, but it happened enough -- sometimes, I would just shoot'em.  Here's where I fade into Kingpin's gameplay. Well, it's on the Quake II engine and your old settings, with a few exceptions, should work for you. Nothing really new to tell you, but I will reiterate. The addition of drafting thugs to aid you battles is, mmm, the game just wouldn't be as exciting without this feature. Now the weapons, on the other hand, grenade launchers, bazookas, heavy machine guns, they may sound dated, but there are a wide variety of ways to kill your enemies.  It may be a little old school, but the frags are just as refreshing. It's the sound and the look that make Kingpin really shine.  Kingpin has some of the best sound effects ever to grace an earlobe. When I first heard that Cypress Hill was doing the soundtrack, I did cartwheels. But man, there are only a few tracks on there. In fact, it's just a few repeating breaks. So that was a small letdown. But in the game's defense, the sound of the guns alone, phew, my goodness. And the cussing, no matter how many times I heard the F word, man, it just made my neck hair raise in rage, it would affect me. I couldn't help but to feel a tad embarrassed when I was caught cussing back at the screen, ~What the f--k do you want, bitch?!~ From water drops to passing trains, there's a whole array of other sounds that'll keep you engrossed in Kingpin's world. I think a few more songs from Cypress Hill wouldn't have hurt, though.  As much as I don't want to admit it, when compared to other first person shooters, Kingpin: Life of Crime, even with great looking graphics, cussing and cool level design, may feel redundant to some, but the game is never boring. Let me explain. Although it is just search and destroy, with a few puzzles to stall you from your next victim, Kingpin does capitalize the ~A~ in action and the ~V~ in violence. So for those who get off on that stuff, like myself, well, you're going to have a blast with Kingpin. However, die-hard FPS fans will look past all the vicious gore, endure all the cussing and will realize that Kingpin doesn't offer as much as everyone says it does. Still, though, I have to stand behind this title simply because I'm a huge action film buff (John Woo = Higher Being) and I love action games -- and boy, does this game have a lot of action.  To put it bluntly, if you take this game at face value, for blood and action, you'll love Kingpin: Life of Crime. If you go in there with cocky high standards, you may grow tired of it rather quickly.  -- Jay Boor", "date": "Jul 17, 1999"}
