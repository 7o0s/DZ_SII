And, sure enough, there are a handful of baseball and football games on sale in the Wii Shop, along with takes on soccer, hockey and even six-on-six volleyball. But it wasn't until the release of this game, Double Dribble, two weeks ago that the VC finally got its first basketball game  a shame, since the sport is such a big deal and has so many fans, and a further shame since Double Dribble is likely to disappoint all those same players. This game is a novel effort from the 8-bit days, and was the first accurate simulation of basketball to be made for a Nintendo system. But so many advancements and upgrades have been made in the genre in the past 20 years that Double Dribble really feels like it's relic.   Four different teams are yours to command, each of them statistically identical but clothed in different colors  the Chicago Ox, the New York Eagles, the Los Angeles Breakers and the Boston Frogs. NBA-licensed basketball games would only come later to Nintendo systems, so Konami's choice in creating these teams in 1987 was to get thematically close to the real deal without actually infringing. The Ox instead of the Bulls for Chicago, but still colored red. The Breakers (which rhymes with Lakers) for Los Angeles. The Frogs for Boston, which aren't anything like a ~Celtic~ really, but are still colored green.   Even before selecting your squad, setting the length of the game from 5 to 30 ~game time~ minutes and choosing the difficulty level for the opposition, though, you get to bear witness to a stage-setting cutscene  with the sell-out crowd of audience members arriving at the basketball stadium while the national anthem plays. It's a skippable scene, but it introduces Double Dribble's emphasis on presenting a cinematic experience, which continues into the actual gameplay.   If you manage to pull off an impressive dunk, the game will shift to a brief cinematic cutscene to emphasize your greatness.  There, as seen just above, you'll witness further cinematic scenes throughout the course of each game when interesting events like slam dunks take place. You'll be rushing toward the hoop, getting your position set, pressing the A Button to make the shot  and the entire gameplay view will disappear for just about two seconds, replaced with a ~zoomed-in~ view of the dunk in action. Like the national anthem scene, these cinematic moments are fair enough elements to experience early on. After repeated play, though, and after you continue to see the same slow-motion dunking scenes over and over again, the breaks in action can begin to wear on you.   And even if they don't, the sheer simplicity and lack of depth in Double Dribble's basic gameplay certainly will. You might be right on board with knock-off mascots, large amounts of cutscenes and the rest of the Double Dribble package, but you'd be hard-pressed to genuinely love the way the game actually represents basketball without wishing for more.   The controls, for example, are primitive at best. It's often difficult to command your active player to attempt a block or steal, and learning how to place your shots properly takes time and practice. But then, on the other side of the coin, shots become far too easy to consistently make once you learn the court's ~hot spots~ and can continuously exploit them for points.   Further, though you do get the full five players on each team, those four that you aren't directly controlling at any one time will often act erratically  sometimes staying on the wrong side of the court when the possession of the ball changes, or else just running around like madmen. It doesn't feel like it's much of a team sport. More like you playing basketball alone, while four goofballs in like-colored jerseys take up space on the court.   The total of ten players also contributes to difficulties in the game's graphics. The NES hardware couldn't handle a ton of simultaneous sprites, so games that attempted too many at once often became plagued by flickering visuals  Double Dribble was among them. This VC version seems to do a better job at reducing that problem, but you'll still see it occur on occasion.   Finally, for all Double Dribble's visual pizzazz, its audio category drops the ball entirely. Matches are played out in nearly complete silence, with only the sound effect of the dribbling ball coming out of your speakers. Some songs make the cut for the game's menu screen and half-time show, but beyond those this game's crowd is about as loud as the on-lookers at a PGA golf tournament.So, overall, Double Dribble earns itself a solid rating of ~pass it by.~ It can be fun and nostalgic to sit down and compete with a friend in two-player mode, but it's just such a basic and old design that even any early appeal it might have won't last long. What's most encouraging about Double Dribble coming to the VC, though, isn't anything about this particular game  it's that it's a sports game from Konami. And old-school players know that sports games, from Konami, from the NES, also include Blades of Steel. That's a title that's aged much more gracefully over the years, so let's hope that Double Dribble's Wii Shop debut is a sign that the Steelers will be skating again soon....and maybe we'll get a better basketball game somewhere in the next 200 VC releases.", "date": "Dec 14, 2007"}
