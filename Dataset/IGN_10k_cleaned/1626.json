No, really.  Yes, it's a game based on a silly cartoon license that NewKidCo probably picked up for a song and a half, but I was initially surprised to find it based on what was once a solid gameplay concept, and I was even more surprised to pick the game up and see the Warthog logo on it, Warthog being the developers of Starlancer and Star Trek: Invasion.  While the bad omens were bad, the good omens were there to outweigh them.  It's the bad ones that came true, though.  There's a very limited amount of fun to be had with House Trap, and not anywhere near enough to justify the expense.  You can have essentially the same game for perhaps three dollars at your local Funcoland, and with cooler protagonists to boot.  Gameplay  Tom & Jerry In: House Trap is, essentially, the direct descendant of a very old NES game you might remember, Spy Vs. Spy.  Oh, you don't remember that one?  Well, big shock there.    Spy Vs. Spy was based on the comic strip of the same name, taking its decades-long struggle from the pages of MAD magazine and making a game out of it.  The white and black spies would run around a building consisting of a finite number of rooms, set traps here and there, and hope the other guy blundered into some contraption that would flatten him or blow him up.  Tom and Jerry may not be intentionally based on Spy Vs. Spy, but those who played the latter will find the former hauntingly familiar.  Tom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) run around a house consisting of a finite number of rooms, set traps here and there, and hope the other guy blunders into some contraption that will flatten him or blow him up.  If the indirect approach - setting up mousetraps, vacuums, falling bowling balls, and the like - doesn't appeal to you, though, you can always resort to the simpler expedient of braining the other guy with a shovel.  You see the house via the same side-scrolling split-screen view as in Spy Vs. Spy, and while a layer of depth has been added by the 3D graphics, allowing you limited movement on the Z-axis, the game is still essentially the same.  You set traps, hope they work, and occasionally resort to some clumsy Power Stone-style brawling.  This is entertaining, and Warthog's handling of the control and game balance is sound, but like the cartoons it's inspired by, the appeal wears extremely quickly.  It's like the slams reel on a BMX video: the same thing over and over again, and once you see it enough you realize that it wasn't even very funny the first time.  Each mission does not introduce you to an entirely new area, but instead merely adds one more room onto the existing house, and as such you'll rapidly run out of new traps and such to brain your opponent with.   Graphics  This looks like a Tom & Jerry cartoon, alright.  The game moves quickly, and the animations are amusing re-creations of their 2D ancestors, but it still features very limited visuals.  The texture art in particular is quite bland, and there's nothing much in the way of polygonal invention to fill the corners of the mysterious pet-owner's house.  There's only so much you can do with a fifties-vintage house and a pair of established cartoon characters for a cast - House Trap does that and no more.  Sound  By the same token, there's a limited amount of audio expression available in this game.  The classic (I use the term advisedly) Tom & Jerry cartoons had a very small effects suite - neither of the heroes ever spoke, and so all there was to add an aural touch to was a quick dash or the hideous crunch of some blunt object.  Thus, just about all you'll ever hear over the carny-music themes is a slide-whistle charge or some variation on the theme of ~crash,~ ~bang,~ or ~smash.~  Faithful to its inspiration, this game is, but not that much fun to listen to. Not much fun to anything, really.  It's only thirty dollars, but as I find myself thinking so often, thirty dollars will buy you an awful lot of game if you're willing to hit the used racks.  Hell, Spy Vs. Spy itself is...sorry, I was wrong up there in the introductory paragraph.  It's actually six dollars, or about 16 if you go for the newer Game Boy version.If you're hunting for a bargain, then, be advised that while the PlayStation has its deals, there are even better ones available on consoles past, and don't be particularly worried if you miss Tom & Jerry.", "date": "Dec 12, 2000"}
