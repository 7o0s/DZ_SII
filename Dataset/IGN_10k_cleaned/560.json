Turok: Rage Wars on the Game Boy Color, however, is nothing like the console game...at all. But what it is is a halfway decent action game along the lines of Contra. Features Multiple style levels Multiple weapons Password save Only for Game Boy Color  Gone in this Turok is the cookie-cutter, action-platformer feel from the past two games. The game is now an exclusive, Color-only title which takes advantage of the extra power of the Color handheld. The game is no longer a flat, 2D action game with a generic feel. It's now a rather cool title with a lot of variety in each of the game levels. In one style, you simply follow the path and take out the wave of dinosaur bad guys in your way. In others, it's a forced scrolling game where you have to make it through a walled fortress before the screen pushes you off the edge. And in one really difficult level, you have to maneuver on a tiny raft as it floats down the river, trying to nail enemies that leap out from the brush at the banks.  What's really funny about Turok: Rage Wars is the fact that it was designed by the same development group that worked on Turok and Turok:Seeds of Evil on the Game Boy  and like those games, the Turok sprite hasn't changed a bit. It's almost as if the developer had to make a whole new game using the existing character sprites from the previous games. But instead of fixing the game in a 2D platformer, the developers now let you run not only left and right, but also into the foreground and background. This change of design really adds to the game and gives the gamer more freedom to maneuver. It also gives the game a lot more variety than just a simple run and jump game.  The complaints are few but obvious  you have a ton of weapons to choose from, but most of the time the knife (your standard weapon) is the best choice. Even though it's only for use close-up, it has more kick than some of the more powerful projectiles at far range.  I liked Turok: Rage Wars a lot more than the past two bland Turok games from Acclaim.  I'm a little disappointed that Bit Managers didn't adopt the N64 design for the Game Boy Color rendition  a deathmatch game would have been really cool on the Game Boy Color, even if it had to be put into an overhead perspective. Still, for what it is, Turok: Rage Wars is a decent action game that blows away its successors.", "date": "Dec 18, 1999"}
