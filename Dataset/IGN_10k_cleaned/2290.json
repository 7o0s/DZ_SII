After all, it's pretty safe to say that general interest in pro wrestling as a general entertainment phenomenon is down a good deal in the last two years or so.  RAW doesn't draw the ratings it used to, you don't see as many pay-per-views gracing the big screens of sports bars, and walking around in public wearing an Austin 3:16 shirt is decidedly unhip nowadays.  Nevertheless, interest in wrestling videogames remains uniformly rabid -- Just Bring It presently holds the traffic record for a single story on a single day here, and we easily get more mail on the subject than any other game.  So there must be an awful lot of crossover between shut-in lifeless game geeks and shut-in lifeless wrestling geeks.  Shut-in lifeless game/wrestling geeks, this is the title for y'all: WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It is a respectable effort from THQ and Yuke's.  Like every other Smackdown before it, it's got great gaping swathes of room for improvement, and some of the additions made to the series' PS2 debut have roundly backfired, but it still succeeds in the areas that make the series popular.  Its presentation of the WWF's characters and theatrics is excellent, and its gameplay doesn't demand a whole lot of effort to pick up, play, and start pulling off plenty of fun moves.  The sound is pretty raw, and Story Mode is still a very questionable effort, but who didn't expect that right out of the gate?  Graphics  Just Bring It is one of the oddest blends of excellent and excrable graphics on PS2.  Its core is obviously an upgrade or derivation of the PlayStation graphics engine, rather than an entirely new creation, and this holds it back in several ways, although aspects of its presentation well outstrip the Xbox-powered RAW.    On the up side, we have excellent animation, including a gigantic library of moves, superb camera direction, which makes up for a lot of the deficiencies in modeling and texturing, and some very cool lighting effects, adding immeasurably to the intros for wrestlers like HHH.  The roster of competitors isn't complete considering time considerations, but there are over 50 wrestlers to pick from and plenty of different arenas in which to do battle.  Essentially, the good stuff that could be carried over from the PlayStation games with ease and the basic effects that could be implemented on PS2 without much trouble are here, while the presentation aspects that the lemmings clamor for (entrances first among them) have gotten the most direct attention in the PS2 development cycle.  This game has dynamite animation and direction when the wrestlers make their way to the ring.  On the down side, the modeling ranges from smooth to terrible, some textures are warped or very blurry, and there simply doesn't seem to have been a lot of concentrated effort to make the wrestlers themselves look substantially better on PS2.  Any character with long hair looks ridiculous -- they've got flat single polygons with badly alpha-channeled textures clipping through their chest, back, and shoulders (see: Rhyno, Chris Jericho, either Hardy, Lita) -- and facial animation is all over the map, with some characters looking fine and others with a strange 90-degree joint in their upper lips.  Most clothing is still textured on instead of modeled in 3D, making many wrestlers' trunks and pads look very silly.  The central arenas also haven't changed substantially, aside from a higher resolution and the addition of the 3D entrance ramp.  The crowd is still flat, with very simple animation, and the instances where you can fight in the crowd just look silly, the two-dimensional fans moving aside according to some hidden, inexorable force.  Backstage, on the other hand, has gotten a nice tune-up, with bigger and better-looking areas like the boiler room and parking lot.  WWF New York is pretty impressive, too, although it takes a lot of effort to go all the way out across the street.  One final issue with the the arena graphics can't be overemphasized.  I've played both games in complete or near-complete form, and there isn't any competition of any kind -- the Xbox's RAW has much, much better signs.  Both games have an excellent variety of fan-made placards, and the selection in the crowd is tailored to match the wrestlers in the ring, but everything in Smackdown is just generic lemming crap like ~HBK~ or ~I AM THE GAME~ and all that sort of nonsense that would only be brought to an event by some brain-damaged twelve-year-old with a permanently atrophied sense of humor (unfortunately, a class which also sends in most of our Smackdown e-mail).  Where are the ~WHAT'S KAYFABE?~s and ~BIG SHOW STOLE MY GIMMICK~s?  Let me see signs created by someone with creativity in the next PS2 WWF game.  Gameplay  Another holdover from the PlayStation, of course, is the fighting system in Just Bring It, which is essentially unchanged in comparison to Know Your Role, at least as far as the user interface is concerned.  Every necessary action is mapped to one button, occasionally combined with a D-pad direction.  You have basic attacks on the strike and grapple buttons (X and Circle), one-button reversals on Square (requiring only proper timing to execute), and running in various directions on Triangle.  Other buttons only come into play in specialized situations -- for example, L1 is reserved for manipulating international objects.  The selection of moves is still substantial, what with all the variations made possible by D-pad motions, running attacks, dizziness stages, and other qualifiers, but loyalists of the Fire Pro or Virtual Pro game systems won't be swayed by any changes here.  Beneath the familiar surface, though, a few things have been changed and upgraded.  While damage reactions are still a little random, the famous Smackdown kip-up has been toned down a fair bit, such that wrestlers actually lay down for finishing moves now if you hit the pin quick enough.  Submissions still have questionable efficacy, though -- it takes a lot of beating to get someone in bad enough shape to win with the Crippler Crossface or Walls of Jericho, although opponents will drop like flies to submission holds once you wail on them enough.  On the related subject of sustained beating, you have to do your damnedest to get an opponent to the ~groggy~ stage in this game.  I'm referring, of course, to the dizzy state where you can execute finishing moves and all the really amusing grapple attacks (like Yoshihiro Tajiri's evil mist, now available in three flavors).  Standard wrestling game practice since the old Fire Pro days is for wrestlers to stand up in the groggy state after taking a reasonable amount of punishment, making it possible to easily perform the full range of moves, but Just Bring It chooses to reserve grogginess as a response to only certain assaults.  For the most part, it only happens when you hit an opponent with certain strikes and reversals.  Thus, a great many moves are nearly impossible to do, and you have to have very tricky positioning and timing to pull off most grapple submission moves.  As a secondary result, characters whose finishers are activated in comparatively simple positions (Tajiri springs to mind -- his kick finisher can be performed on any grounded opponent) get a bit of an unfair advantage.  If Smackdown's basic gameplay still has some holes, though, the selection of match types and modes is obsessively complete.  You've got table matches, TLC, multiple cage types, submission matches, hardcore matches, I Quit, street fights (with plenty of backstage areas to fight in), battle royals, a pretty faithful Royal Rumble, and tag or six-man options in nearly every type.  The engine is strong enough to stuff six competitors into the ring without the framerate skipping, too.  While having that many wrestlers and a referee in the mix makes handling your facing a pain in the neck, even with the handy color-coded facing indicator, there's more than enough multiplayer options here for a year of Friday nights with your friends.  That's very important, since I'll wager far more people play wrestling games with friends than alone.  As for the much-ballyhooed Story Mode, well, the third time is not necessarily the charm.  I'll say this for it: at least it works now.  The PlayStation Smackdowns featured season/story modes, but they didn't offer much in the way of entertainment value -- they were more like excruciating torments you endured in exchange for unlocking the hidden characters and matches.  JBI completely revises the structure of Story Mode, tossing out the idea of a continuous season and replacing it with a set of short vignettes that you can finish in a setting.  Any given Story includes anywhere from perhaps 1-4 matches, interleaved with cinematic sequences and Roaming Mode, a sequence where you explore the arena in first-person view to find branches in the story.  This is a good idea, and would work perfectly if there were more branches to the story included.  As it is, you can exhaust the possibilities of Story Mode fairly quickly.  Every story begins and progresses the same way, and so it's easy to learn what fork takes you where and what you earn once you get there.  On occasion, you don't even get that much out of a trip through the mode -- begin with a title holder and you just wrestle a single match.  A lengthy story features a lot of dead air, too.  The cinematics are very basic, featuring dull and poorly-edited text, and they're far too long, the folks at Yuke's evidently assuming that their target audience reads very, very slowly and enjoys watching a virtual Vince McMahon flap his gums for 30 seconds.  Long and the short of it is, this doesn't do a whole lot to enhance Smackdown's value as a single-player experience.  Finally, to cover one of those annoying Q&A bases, the table match is better, but still not great.  The table behavior is a little more predictable, and it's easier to put a supine opponent through with a powerbomb or top-rope move, but the collision detection for grapple moves through tables is still very random.  Create-a-wrestler is as good as it was in Smackdown, barring the same visual issues that plague the look of the existing wrestlers (create-a-taunt and create-a-stable are as previous, too).  And...lessee...no, you can't go through the Hell in the Cell, yes, you can do whatever off the top of the ladder, no, there's no Rob Van Dam, yes, I do hate you all and wish you were dead...that probably covers it.  [Editor's note: To update, you may or may not be able to go through the Hell in the Cell, depending on what Sanders Keel has had for breakfast on a given morning.  We apologize for the error.]  Sound  You know all of you who were begging for audio commentary?  All you fans who clamored and bitched and moaned for two years of PSX Smackdowns without the feature?  You should have shut the hell up and counted your blessings.  Just Bring It features arguably the worst commentary on the market in any game or genre -- both the writing and scripting are terrible.  Nothing interesting or informative ever issues from the mouth of either Michael Cole or Tazz, and on top of that, their remarks are often hilariously disjointed.  EA and Sega Sports and such have mostly managed to kick the problem of mixing individual elements into stock phrases, but THQ appears to be well behind in this regard.  Thus, you get lots of lines like ~STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN...is the best...WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION...we've ever had!~ and ~His...SWAN-TON BOMB...is really dangerous!~  Some other choice lines:  Cole: ~Who will win the match?~ Tazz: ~I think this match is good.~ Cole: ~Anything is allowed in the...SINGLES MATCH.~ Tazz: ~That's not good?~ Cole: ~I think this is fine!~ Tazz: ~This...TAG TEAM MATCH...is gonna be great!~ Cole: ~Mexican Surfboard!~ Rev. Smith: ~It's a &*%$ing Romero Special, you nasty little goateed punk.~  Outside the commentary, JBI's soundtrack is more of a mixed bag, but there are definitely other down notes to be found in the musical score.  Every wrestler has their authentic theme music, which is cool, but there's nothing playing during an actual match except a limited selection of extremely painful electronic rock tunes (with rap breakdowns.  No, seriously).  Luckily, the developers have been kind enough to add independent volume controls for the sound and music, so you can kill the BGM and just listen to the crack of punches and the thump of the mat, which don't sound that bad at all on their own.  Of course, I'm assuming you'll have turned off the commentary before you reach that juncture.I dunno.  Does it really matter what I think?In case you're wondering, yes, that was a straight line for all you kids.  Fall for it?  Thought so.But no, it doesn't matter. Legions will flock to their EBs and Blockbusters to bring this one home, 'cuz it's wrestling, and it's all you can get. Sort of like the XWF that way, or some backwoods indy promotion headlining their biggest show of the year with Honky Tonk Man vs. King Kong Bundy.Sorry, got off track there. ~Just Bring It~ is an improvement, but the perfect WWF game remains well out of reach.  Hopefully we'll see something that finally plugs all the holes later on -- for now, well...~I think this is fine!~Thanks for your input, Michael.", "date": "Nov 20, 2001"}
