Rush'n Attack makes its high-def debut on Xbox Live Arcade this week. A port of the original arcade version -- also known as Green Beret -- Rush'n Attack brings you back to the enemy base to save the prisoners of war as you brave attack dogs, attack helicopters and communist karate experts along the way.   One thing that has not changed from the original is the difficulty -- Rush'n Attack is tough. Even with four different difficulty settings and the ability to increase your total lives to seven at the start, beating Rush'n Attack all the way through is a real challenge. To survive this side-scroller, you have to be quick with the knife and a crack-shot with special weapons picked up along the way: a flame-thrower, bazooka and grenades.    Hot new videos for your viewing pleasure. Click now.   A minor problem with these old quarter-munching ports is that there is no save system, so there's no going back to the fourth and final level. Instead, you have to fight the good fight all over again from the start. Hey, it is possible to beat the game in less than 10 minutes -- an achievement as well as one of the reasons the game is called ~Rush'n Attack.~ And also because you're obviously fighting the Reds. Still, beating the game is such a challenge that sometimes you want to skip ahead. But, perhaps, that's part of the beauty of these classic arcade titles.    Another classic moment -- if you stay in one place too long, an enemy fighter plane will fly in and drop a bomb on you, immediately ending your game.   The controls are fairly simple -- hit A to stab commies. Use the left stick to move and jump. Hit B to use your special weapon, our personal favorite being the flamethrower that triggers a classic skin-melting skeleton animation. The D-Pad is an absolute mess, but that's poor manufacturing on Microsoft's part. You're better off using the left stick to move your super soldier, although it does not feel as responsive as a classic joystick. When commies are coming at you from all sides, responsiveness is key.    Get used to this screen. The classic sound and visuals are intact and the enhanced graphics and sound are decent too. Back in the day, Rush'n Attack set the bar for virtual tanks and Cold War theme music and it's great to see the old game back in action, if only for the memories. Still, when you see the effort that Ubisoft is putting in with classic games like Prince of Persia, it's sad to see that Rush'n Attack is such a bare-bones port. You can play split-screen multiplayer on Xbox Live or take turns locally, but we would have liked to see some added length to this all-too-brief stabbing adventure.   But hey, you can't fault Konami for another faithful classic arcade port. Rush'n Attack does stand the test of time as a competent side-scroller. Fans of the original will get a kick out of the download. If you never played the original, try the demo. We're betting that the game is just too short and challenging to hold your attention for long.", "date": "May 25, 2007"}
