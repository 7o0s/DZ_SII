The grand sporting event is composed of a great number of events, but there is no way a team of developers has the time or energy to digitally recreate each event. So, at some board table or over coffee, the decision must be made -- which events do we cut? Invariably, some fans will be disappointed that their favorite event didn't make it -- other fans will look at the selection of available events and wonder (aloud) why some did make the cut?   Torino only encompasses four events as it is, so that left me with three other events to pique my interest. This isn't to say that the mechanics behind the curling event are poor. They work pretty well, not unlike a bowling game, with meters that determine power, angle, and spin. Except that in curling, you can use brooms to sweep a path for the stone in hopes of affecting its final trajectory down the ice. It works well enough, but the event is somewhat slow (in both real life and the mobile game).   Downhill Skiing is a better event. You must slalom through a lengthy series of gates. Miss a gate and you get a five-second penalty to your score. Trust me, that stuff adds up. I thought the mechanics in slalom were convincing. The sharper you turn, the slower your skier goes. You have to decide whether or not you just have to abandon a gate and take the time hit, or risk cutting across the snow so slow you end up losing even more than five seconds. The course is bumpy, and when you go over a crest, you better make sure you're going straight because landing at an angle cuts time, too.   Ski Jump is only decent, with very limited mechanics that make it more mathematical than skill-based. You hold the jump key and then release to launch off the tip of the jump. In the air, you use 4 and 6 to keep your skier balanced, then press 5 again to stick the landing. Once you get the rhythm, there's little juice left in the event.   Bobsleigh, however, is one of Torino's redeemers. The ice chute, which looks like a cross between Tempest and TRON (compliment!), is full of turns that you must negotiate to keep up your speed. There is a small dot that turns red or green, depending on whether your sleigh is in the optimal place to pick up speed. When its bright red, you've gone too far away from the center of the chute and start losing speed. This, of course, requires constant readjustment, and I thought it worked out exceptionally well for such a basic little mini-game.   I appreciated how I-play made the athlete the absolute center of attention. The downhill skier takes up a fair portion of the screen, but not too much that he blocks you view of gates. The sleigh is also sizeable, but not obtrusive. The game uses a lot of whites and blues. In any other case, the limited palette would be a disappointment, but in Torino, it's necessary.   Torino is juiced with a little multiplayer that involves passing the phone around. If you are without human contact, there is always the option of comparing your score to leaderboards. I admit, you will not see my name up there. Especially on curling.   Levi's Note: It recently came to my attention that the licensor -- namely, the Olympics -- dictates the choice of events that make it into Olympic-themed video games.  Torino is half of a good game. The downhill and bobsleigh events are fun, while curling is dull and ski jump is workmanlike. I cannot recommend only half a game to you -- especially at full price. Even if you are gripped by Olympic fever, take a pass on Torino. And next year, I-play? Figure skating. I hear the chicks like figure skating.", "date": "Jan 25, 2006"}
