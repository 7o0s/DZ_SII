The sequel, a Rareware developed platformer, built off of the same impressive graphic compression technology as the first Donkey Kong Country to create a new adventure in the computer-rendered series. Since the original game already pretty much played the ~graphics card~ a year before, the sequel focused much more on the gameplay aspect by changing things up with new character and abilities. Though the game felt familiar, it didn't feel like a quickly developed rehash. The just-released Game Boy Advance rendition is about as impressive a port as the original Donkey Kong Country ended up on the handheld: much more focus on the gameplay than the graphics. The result is a very solid port of an already solid platformer, just don't expect to be overwhelmed on the graphic side of the fence. Features Two playable characters New ~Diddy Dash~ mode More than three new mini-games Cartridge save (three slots)  In Donkey Kong Country 2 the game plays off the fact that Donkey Kong (and a banana booty) have been kidnapped by crocodile pirates, so this time it's up to his partner Diddy to save the day. Rare's sequel moves the series forward by introducing a new playable character to the mix. Where the original Donkey Kong Country brought to life Diddy Kong for the player pairing, Donkey Kong Country gives players a new Kong: Dixie, Diddy's blonde-haired girlfriend that can glide by ~swooshing~ her ponytail in the air.  The well-balanced Donkey Kong Country gameplay design hasn't changed a whole lot for the sequel, offering up the same style of fun and challenging run, jump and bounce game design that the original DKC established more than ten years ago. But even though the series' notoriety comes from its graphical techniques, it wouldn't be anything without a solid game design, and DKC2 definitely continues that tradition. In fact, the developers throw in more ~Donkey Kong~-esque ideas into the mix. Watch for the clever rope technique where either Kong can climb up or down a la Donkey Kong Jr.'s vine climb: one rope slower and safer, two ropes faster but more vulnerable.  There are other new ideas to spice things up, including the buddy toss technique that comes in handy when trying to score some out of reach goodies.  Like most of Rare's game designs, Donkey Kong Country 2 has a huge focus on ~collectibles,~ and most of the collectibles reward players with extra lives. It's this focus that sort of kills a bit of DKC's overall challenge, since players can score dozens upon dozens of extra lives during the quest. There are spots in the adventure that can be revisited to stockpile lives, and with the cartridge save, players can save a reserve so large that they'll never see the ~Game Over~ screen.  As far as SNES to Game Boy Advance conversions go, this one fared about as well as the original Donkey Kong Country did. The graphic engine does oversaturate the Super NES artwork in order for it to be visible on the small front-lit LCD screen of the GBA SP, and it's because of this that the game loses a bit of its original visual appeal.  But the graphics still do hold up even ten years later, but they lose their impressive sheen in the conversion from big screen to small. The Donkey Kong Country series has been known for its outstanding soundtrack, and once again the tunes come out excellently on the little speaker. Don't expect the SNES reverb on the GBA, but at least the portable hardware has the right stuff to make the existing tunes sound great.  And like the conversion of Donkey Kong Country, DKC2 isn't a flat-out port. Along with the brand new ~story~ introduction, there are games within the game, little minichallenges like a ~fly through the hoops~ helicopter game, or an ostrich race that as many as four players can compete in with only one copy of the cartridge. They're not super awesome creations or anything, but these little games are at the very least acknowledgement that Rare's handheld development studio wasn't satisfied with simply converting existing product over to the GBA. The Nintendo portable market continues to be a comfortable outlet for classic NES and Super NES game designs, and that's really not going to change any time soon. The Donkey Kong Country series is better known for its graphics than its gameplay, but even still the game's level designs offer up more than the ~routine.~ Even a decade after its original release, the sequel offers up good, solid fun on the Game Boy Advance.", "date": "Nov 15, 2004"}
