Then the sequel, Day Watch came out (not yet released in North America), and broke the record of the first installment. And with impressive special effects, stylish camera work and a heavy mysticism that the region has long been known for, it was probably only a matter of time until one of the local game publishers and developers took a stab at making a game out of it. Based on the Silent Storm engine, the game is an isometric, turn-based squad strategy title, but it's not a straight translation of the film's plot or characters. You'll see some of the same people, but the protagonist is an all-new character, Stas, an initiate into the struggle between the forces of light and darkness.   Unlike the conceit set out in the film, however, Stas does not experience a traumatic spiritual event that is supposed to trigger entry into this endless tug-of-war between two equally opposed forces. He simply goes from being a hit man to being an ~Other~ when he decides not to go through with the job. His shift from normal human being to someone who fights against the forces of darkness is abrupt and delivered with both chunky exposition and a surprising amount of confidence and unexplained breadth of knowledge regarding what he's stumbled into. This would not be such a problem were the game not so heavily loaded with narrative. And while the voice acting is uniformly solid, the Silent Storm engine doesn't appear to be up to the task of scripting smooth scenes in between the action. We're told that a patch is coming out that will improve the lip synching, but the overall character animation is dated and sometimes almost robotic; and the fact that the voice acting is so much better than the visuals during these scenes makes the animation feel that much worse.   The isometric, turn-based gameplay recalls Silent Storm, but fans of that game should heed a few warnings. While the basic mechanics are the same, the tactics of Night Watch are much simpler. It may seem as though the game provides a lot of nuance, but the average engagement will boil down to just repeating a few key strategies that will become quickly evident to someone who's played Silent Storm or Jagged Alliance. There is a twist in that much if not most of the combat takes place in the Gloom, a mirror world where the characters have more action points and sometimes more places to go. While in the Gloom, your energy points (what you use to make special attacks) are chipped off every turn, and when you run out, the Gloom starts chipping away at your health points. Of the three class types -- shape shifter, sorcerer and mage -- the mage can regenerate energy every round, once they've achieve the character level that unlocks that skill, but you'll still want to replenish your two pools with objects strewn about and found on your vanquished foes. The sorcerer will take these common objects -- everything from apples to lottery tickets -- and enchant them for different types of boosts, and the shape shifter is your melee fighter. Although a strategy game needs a strict set of classes, it's disappointing to have only three to choose from, since the film tells us that the Others have a very wide variety of abilities.     Although having two parallel worlds to choose from sounds tactically intriguing, some other problems crop up during gameplay. One is the pathing system, which can cause a logjam in tight spaces. Another is that it takes a few hours before you become sufficiently aware of what each opponent type is capable of and how to properly fight them. And since each attack is based on a range radius and a percentage chance to hit, you can end up with some frustrating dice rolls; if you hit a bad run, what could have been a manageable fight becomes a struggle to just survive. And often, enemies do not appear until you're too close to position your team properly; sometimes you're simply ambushed from multiple sides, and other times additional waves of opponents appear when you thought you had a fight wrapped up. Thus the gameplay balance feels unpredictable. Sometimes the enemy AI will waste a turn getting closer to you when they could have struck from afar, and other times a unit might just drain your energy and run out of action points to do anything with them. One gets the sense that not enough playtesting was done, and this is unfortunate because the potential for tight, satisfying and varied combat is there.With an in-game cutscene engine that doesn't look like it's up to the technological task, and gradually underwhelming combat, Night Watch's strongest point becomes a clearer explanation of the story universe than what was provided in the film -- but that's not exactly what we're looking for here. Plus the game is interspersed with clips from the film that are so abruptly delivered that they border on the non sequitur. And there is some branching gameplay, but you can really choose to take one side or the other. If you liked the film and what to know more about the lore, then the game will provide plenty of interesting information. But the longer you play, the more the gameplay itself becomes an uninteresting hurdle to enlightenment.", "date": "Jul 13, 2006"}
