There is a lot to learn and there can be a fair amount of maintenance time, but after a few hours, the obsession with building a better ship (and dominating on the high seas) takes over and the magic begins to happen. If you're a fan of both the strategy of designing a powerful machine and taking it into battle, then this could be your new addiction.   If you've never played the original Naval Ops: Warship Gunner then that's okay -- playing the game requires no previous knowledge to get going. The storyline takes place in an alternate universe in 1939 where the country of Wilkia decides to declare war on everyone that's not going to go along with them and their new empire. As a commander of a ship that was out to sea when this coup happens, the player becomes a rogue agent in this global war. The goal is to roam all of the oceans and sink a ton of ships along the way.    But first there are some formalities to take care of that aren't so interesting. In fact, they're about as much fun as doing your taxes. But take heart: there's a pretty hefty refund at the end of it. To get up to speed, there are almost two hours of tutorials to get through. And at the end of that you get a ship that's slowly trudges through the water as it tries to shoot bullets that are barely more effective than getting the sailors to throw some rocks from the deck. Within a couple of missions the game gets up to speed and everything clicks.   Getting a better ship is all about making it yourself from parts that you create through research and development. And this research is funded by finishing up missions in the regular story mode or the Training which is simply all of the missions that you've already passed. With 1500 parts that can be developed, it can certainly look overwhelming, but deciding on the next piece of gear that you absolutely have to have is pretty simple. With an easy tech tree layout it's always a snap to see what the next upgrade will be, if you can afford it, and how many turns it will take to research before you can snap it into a new design and go to war.    If that number of parts is still overwhelming, keep in mind that many of them are such small increments that they're practically redundant. The next step up from your two-barrel torpedo launcher may be a three-barrel option, but when you have enough cash to go for the seven-barrel option and all points in between, you'll simply go for that (and in the process pick up five upgrades in one go). There are times when you'll have baby steps in upgrades and others will be quantum leaps in performance. And when you start to develop airplanes that can be launched from the deck, you'll often order half a dozen planes at once with the cheap prices and loads of variations.   If you're a fan of tweaking a setup to get the most performance out of it, then the design aspect of the game is where it's at. After getting a new weapon or engine or radar system, it's a geeky thrill to figure out where on your current boat you're going to put it or maybe you'll scrap the whole thing and start from scratch. If you're planning to perform rush attacks against weak enemies, then load up the front. But if you want to attract attention and fight while on the run, the heavy guns will go on the back. Just don't put on too much or else you'll lose speed. And that may be null and void because of this super-hot new engine that's almost out of R&D. It's easy to get lost here and it gets crazier with the different ships and submarines to trick out.    Even though the game may start off in the beginning of an alternate-universe WWII era, the upgrades and options quickly go past that to modern times and beyond. Plasma and laser weapons become available and along with that, the gameplay gets a bit of an arcade feel. As big as Warship Gunner 2 gets, and it gets damn big, it still focuses on having fun in the fights themselves.   After loading up with anti-air, anti-sub and anti-surface weapons, the action is all about one ship taking down entire fleets in each mission. With a truly large and powerful fleet that's sporting an immense amount of guns and planes, the strategies are focused around culling the herd until it's down to a reasonable size. After that, it's fun to run rampant over the weakened and dispersed ships to send them to the bottom of the sea and pick up any loot or booty that they've left floating on the surface. It feels so cathartic to ram into other boats and lay waste with tons of torpedoes and machine guns that when the option to leave the battle comes up you'll want to stick around just to make sure everyone's been taken care of.    With all the fun that's happening in the fighting and the upgrading it's a shame that the graphics don't quite hold up as well as they should. Days snap into night on a moment's notice and vice-versa. Even with the simple models for the ships and planes the framerate can take a serious hit while the game's trying to sort out the chaos of dozens of vessels, torpedoes, missiles, and planes dropping bombs from above and how they're all affected by the rolling ocean. There's also the problem of being able to accurately pick out a ship from a crowd from afar for a precise attack. The names get hidden behind a shaded part of the screen and this makes it harder to attack a carrier to stop it from launching planes or taking out the weaker ships.   With all of the possible weapons the focus of Warship Gunner 2 is all about being able to rip it up in the chaotic seas and come out triumphant. It's when that happens that the game shines, but the sluggishness does bring the action down a notch. Then there's the constant farming of cash and passing away turns for items to come out of R&D by redoing the training missions over and over again. Many of these missions can be fairly long and stretch out the time before you're ready for the next mission in the story. It would have been far easier if the training tasks were shorter versions of the originals with smaller areas so that less time is spent sailing from one area to another.   With the repeating of the training missions the playtime comes out to roughly an hour per assignment. Considering that there are 100 missions in all, finishing Warship Gunner 2 is an immense task. The gameplay is fun, but the repetition gets in the way of the story progressing along and holds players back from playing new missions. In the end, it's this that's the biggest problem of the game. It gets tiresome to keep replaying the older missions and if the overall structure had been better, then Warship Gunner 2 could've had a legitimate shot at greatness.With a daunting introduction, Warship Gunner 2 warms up to become a surprisingly exciting and fun title. As the upgrades pile up, the options for approaching each battle multiplies and there's a lot of fun in both the preparation and the action itself. The massive amount of upgrades and missions create more than enough to dig through, but the overall pacing drags the action down and makes the game far more time-intensive than it needs to be.", "date": "Mar 27, 2006"}
