Dynasty Warriors has its share of historical accuracy, mostly in the form of characters and their preferred weapons, but don't let this fool you - this is no boring history lesson.  Each fighter uses his favorite weapon, which range from enchanted maces with a short reach, to long spears and glaives with a maddeningly long reach. The combat has been honed to represent actual weapons combat, and with the exception of a few high-jumping moves, it seems fairly accurate.  Gamers familiar with Namco's Soul Blade may notice the lack of crazy combos, but when you consider that the game runs at 60fps, you begin to understand the reason for the sacrifice. This doesn't pose much of a problem though - the relatively simple combos can be chained to great effect.  No weapons fighter would be complete without an extensive defense system that mirrors real life combat. Dynasty Warriors has three separate ways to avoid being hit: block, parry, and redirect, which leaves your opponent defenseless with their back to you. The downside is this takes a long time to learn to do instinctively, but is ultimately extremely rewarding.  Graphically, the game resembles Tekken II, although in play it is entirely different. This is definitely a thinking person's fighter, and button mashing will get you nothing but a kicked butt. Koei has gone out on a limb with this one, and hopefully it will pay off for them. They reportedly have more action titles already in the works. We can't wait. This won't be the last we hear from Dynasty Warriors on Sony's portable. Unfortunately, this one was rushed for the launch and went into battle unprepared, leaving the intriguing Battlefield Area System squandered (honestly, if we're not going to get more strategy out of it, just give us regular old DW and a good auto-save.) In the meantime, Koei already has a 2D GBA version and an upcoming Nintendo DS edition of this series in the works -- maybe with time to train a more system-tailored graphics engine, those alternate takes will give this series the will to fight. The PSP Dynasty Warriors has its moments, but every one of those has been experienced dozens of times on PS2, and since this PSP game has trouble with the graphics and the stage design, there's not a lot worth rushing back into. Dynasty Warriors a great series to bring to a portable, but it needs to be a great edition to earn its command.", "date": "Jun 28, 1997"}
