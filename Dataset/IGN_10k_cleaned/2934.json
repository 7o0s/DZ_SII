And with the release of the e-Reader for the Game Boy Advance, the company is reviving its classic library of NES games that shipped for the system in its first year on the shelves. But instead of cartridge form, these games come packaged in a set of cards that players scan into the e-Reader device.  Every game system needs a game of pinball, and Nintendo offered its own take on the silverball genre with the cleverly titled Pinball for the NES. In this game, players simply whack around a ball through a single pinball machine that's split into two parts, two screens stacked one on top of the other. Knock down targets, put the ball through specially marked channels, and plop the ball into lit holes for maximum points. If you're good enough, you can head into a special bonus round where you'll have to bounce the ball Breakout style with Mario holding a metal girder.  Pinball was definitely one of the Year One games released on the Nintendo Entertainment System...its graphic presentation isn't exactly overwhelming, with a very plain board layout. There's not much skill involved here, and the ball physics are very...loose. I'm surprised that Nintendo just didn't offer this one for free and force people to buy the Donkey Kong Jr. pack by itself...instead of offering the alternate of getting DKJR instead of this one. The game's not terrible...just strictly average. Even for the NES days.", "date": "Sep 17, 2002"}
