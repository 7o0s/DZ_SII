The pen and paper game has been going strong for more than thirty years, and has evolved from the earlier pre-packaged modules to massive campaigns that spanned vast worlds.  For the most part, players looking to unleash their inner barbarian had to jump onto computers if they wanted to digitally form parties and gain experience points.  However, Kuju Entertainment and Atari have boiled down the tabletop experience onto UMD with their latest release of Dungeons & Dragons: Tactics.  While it does a faithful job of shrinking down the arcane details of the game to portable size, much of the translation suffers from a cluttered menu system along with crucially missing information that most veterans would require.   The one complaint that most newcomers to the Dungeons and Dragons universe often levy against the game is based around the high level of detail and complexity with its rules.  Off-hand proficiencies, encumbrance limits and armor class rankings frequently merge with saving throw die rolls and attack modifiers in a blur of statistics and numbers.  What's more, most of these details are spread across multiple rulebooks, which can sometimes make finding the specific info you're looking for a massive process.  Although it focuses upon the most recent and intricate ruleset for the game (the 3.5 rules that were created a few years ago), D&D: Tactics does an incredible job of boiling down a large amount of information down onto one UMD.  In fact, Kuju provides a glossary that covers most of the random details and obscure facts that you might not necessarily know anything about.   Time to go on an adventure... However, while it fits a ton of elements into the game, it either leaves out key information or standard features of the D&D canon, which can be extremely important as you're navigating your way through dungeons or battlefields.  For instance, one of the most important features when it comes to D&D is having the die rolls available for you to gauge how well your characters are doing in battle.  This covers everything from successful attacks to making your saving throws, as well as any potential modifiers that your characters might have that would apply to the roll itself.  However, with this feature removed, you find yourself somewhat in the dark as to why your characters fail at spellcasting or flanked attacks, even if they should be able to successfully land a blow without a problem.   Even information that you have access to has to be waded through via an extremely convoluted menu system that forces you to often navigate more than three screens before you find the details you need.  For instance, you can pick up an item on the battlefield, but you have no immediate idea what its weight is so that you can check its effect on your character's encumbrance stats.  As a result, you either take the item, hoping that the extra weight doesn't slow your character to a crawl, or you try to examine the item stats by scrolling through multiple menu options on a menu wheel.  This often involves scrolling down each menu window to check out your backpack via party management to see what you may want to keep or get rid off.  After you've fought with this system a few times during battle (as you try to use the multiple options during a fight) or you've wrestled with the menu system during exploration, you'll quickly find yourself wishing there was another way to control your party members.   What the hell is that thing? Speaking of your party members, there are some interesting quirks with the character creation setup.  Players can either use pre-created warriors or create their own, manually adjusting their stats or leaving things up to the game's AI.  You'll need to select a main character, who will essentially be the hero or villain of the plot as they lead their friends around the lands of the Vinsaxi trbe.  Since the game takes your main character's alignment heavily into consideration, players will need to be careful of the decisions that they make along the course of the adventure because it will actually affect the course of the game as well as their personal development.  That means that paladins can fall from grace and become simple fighters, or true neutral characters can make a shift towards either good or evil.   However, there are some hiccups with the character development system as well.  First of all, there's no multi-classing available within the game, which is a D&D standard.  Kiss those Fighter/Mage or three class combos goodbye, which is rather disappointing.  In their place, D&D Tactics included two new character classes to the video game realm: Psions and Psychic Warriors.  While the ability to use mental powers are somewhat intriguing, their usefulness on the Tactics battlefield is frequently more miss than hit, particularly at earlier levels.  I found that many of the other classes were more useful than these warriors, whether that was because of their varying power levels for their mental attacks or unpredictable strikes. One of the psion characters I created, for instance, didn't consistently land psychic attacks until she was at least 5th level, and even that was frequently a toss up.      D&D Tactics tries to balance the gameplay experience by providing a static overworld map before every battle that expands as you complete adventures and open up new paths for your party to explore.  Each location has a couple of options available to players, such as acquiring new weapons and items, hiring or resurrecting party members, and trading items between allies.  All of this is preparation for jumping into an adventure and searching your surroundings for items and killing monsters.  Each mission is classified by a recommended party level limit as well as a set number of party members that can be used for each fight.  It's a good indicator of what you're facing so you have a sense of just how strong the odds are that you're going up against.   Unfortunately, there are some random issues that you run into when you're trying to explore or fight your way through each adventure.  The first one is the camera, which is awkward to manipulate with its limited angle tilts and tightly zoomed in on your party.  Since you don't really have the option to pull the camera out very far to see even on illuminated battlefields, much less darkened dungeon pathways, it can frequently be tricky to gain a sense of where your enemies are until they're right on top of you.  What's more, depending on what angle the camera is pointing when you're moving your party members, you'll be somewhat prevented from moving to a specific space or section until you readjust the camera positioning.   Journey to exotic lands and kill strange beasts... Another issue is the fact that you have to determine whether or not you're going to go after monsters or treasure in every single fight. Obviously, gaining items from treasure chests will strengthen your party, or potentially give them an edge against a future battle that they otherwise wouldn't be able to win.  Unfortunately, if the goal for the mission is accomplished, the mission immediately ends without providing you with extra time to collect items.  Even worse, you can't return to that dungeon for those items, so you often find yourself splintering your parties up to gather as many items as possible, turning those party members into pack mules while the other members fend off attacks. That, or you slowly move through every single area one square at a time, trying to allow everyone to gain access to the chests, which drags the game down to a crawl.   This doesn't improve when you try to play multiplayer games either.  There are five separate multiplayer modes, ranging from deathmatches to dungeon exploration where players control individual warriors.  However, not only do you have to deal with the wonky gameplay issues that you find from the single player experience, you also find that you can't use any of your individually created characters from that single player game either.  Only the pre-generated characters that came with the game can be used in multiplayer games.  It can be really dismaying to build up your party to, say, level 10, hoping to take them online, only to find them restricted from that system.   ... Just be prepared to deal with a lot of issues along the way. Visually, the game is okay, although it can be somewhat difficult to determine what each one of your party members happens to be doing at any point in time.  There are limited melee animations that seem to apply for everything, whether that's from hand to hand weapons or ranged items.  The same can be said for spellcasting, which seem to have the same basic spell animations and effects.  Character models are okay, but somewhat bland, which definitely stands out against the rather impressive backgrounds.  At least the soundtrack for the game is rather nice and sweeping, albeit somewhat limited.What's impressive about D&D Tactics is the fact that the game manages to cram almost every aspect of the pen and paper franchise onto a small UMD, but that comes at a price.  The menus, combat issues and other exclusions really hamper the experience.  If you're a D&D fan or veteran, there is an interesting game to be found here, but you are definitely going to have to wade through some issues to find it.", "date": "Sep 5, 2007"}
