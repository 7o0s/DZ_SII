Unless of course your definition of the proverbial sonic ~bang~ is cheesy, speed hair metal that sounds as if it were ripped from some struggling, cod-piece adorned Northern European metal band circa 1981. Hell, the opening track on the album, the ~Halo Theme Mjolnir Mix~ would have sounded just as cheesy 20 years ago as it does now. Why? Because the combination of faux orchestral strings and searing metal guitar was corny then and it's corny now. That said, the song does embarrassingly call for head banging, over-the-top air guitaring theatrics, but mostly of the slyly ironic kind rather than the full-on, emotionally charged kind. In fact, the best part of the track is when the guitar disappears and haunting wafts of floating monk chants curl over a sparse electronic induced atmosphere.   Breaking Benjamin continue to fuel the guitar driven energy the previous track attempted to set up, unleashing their emotive brand of Alt-Metal angst that bleeds raspy vocals over cranked out guitars and thunder rhythms that alternate between reigned in vocals on the chorus and agro blow-out of scream therapy massage and chug grind machination that serves as a minimal jam break toward the end of the song. All in all it's pretty standard fare for BB.   In addition to the BB boys, chart topping Alt fave Incubus clock in with no less than four tracks on the album. The first of these, ~Follow (1st Movement of the Odyssey)~, begins with chiming guitars and Brandon Boyd's crisp clear voice evoking the aura of Byzantine monks as he chants haunting sounds. It quickly descends into a controlled blast of chaotic prog metalall drums and crashing guitars, before returning to Boyd's eerily detached croon augmented by mild symphonia. At roughly the 1:50 mark Boyd's kicks in with the repeated wail of ~Follow~ for a few bars then the band returns to their mid-tempo speed metal/symphonic twist. It's an unnerving number, to be sure, but a wonderfully twisted turn for the band.    For the ~2nd Movement of the Odyssey~ Incubus revert to swirling intergalactic synth squiggles that bend and float around a quasi-acoustic guitar refrain that is augmented by wavering brush work on the cymbals. There's a definite Pink Floydian vibe to this number, albeit filtered through Incubus' strange SoCal mock Alt-Jazz phonics. That's for the first 1:40, then it veers off severely into atonal guitar noodling and King Crimson inspired prog madness filled with roiling blips and bleeps of electronic mayhem which has been tossed in for good measure (and what a good measure it is).    The ~3rd Movement of the Odyssey~ takes a decidedly more jazz-funk turn, at least at the beginning, which is heavily bass and snare driven with ever-so-slight electronic ambiance floating in the background while horns mingle and float with the lumbering groove. That the guitar can barely be heard wailing away in the background creates a wonderfully detached sense of aural bliss. The song switches midway through to a more guitar driven chug, but it still remains in the slow-to-mid-tempo range. The ~4th Movement of the Odyssey~ mixes all the elements explored on the previous three movements, beginning with conga-styled rhythms and nothing else before escalating into a rousing guitar driven ramble. It's safe to say that Incubus' inclusions on the album are some of the most enjoyable and intriguing, both musically, intellectually, and emotionally.    There are two other non-score tracks on the album. The first of these is ~Never Surrender~ by the album's producer and legendary guitarist Nile Rodgers and Nataraj, which is a mildly cheesy electro-dance number that mixes chants, pounding rhythms, and snippets of in-game female dialogue into a phase-shifting mock techno blast teeming with vocoder effervescence and PoMo disco thunder.  Then there's the ~bonus cut~ supplied by Hoobastank. Entitled ~Connected~ it's a rousing, by the books emphatic Alt Rock fist waver in which frontman Doug Robb crystal clean voice cuts through the schismatic guitar shred and tempered rhythms. It's a bouncy, if predictable number that's catchy while being derivative.     Despite these brief excursions into PoMo/PoMi (Post Modern/Post Millennial) Alt Rock terrain, the bulk of the album is comprised of score crafted by Martin O' Donnell and Michael Salvatori. The duo's instrumental bits tend to lean toward the short and sweet (the longest entry clocking in at 3:06) and riding the fine line between synthetic symphonia and ambient bombast. For example, ~Peril~ is built around what sounds like a faux string section delivering music that is remotely akin to the music dotting Enya's 1988 breakthrough album Watermark. That is to say this piece of score revolves around gentle string plucking, ethereal electronic ambiance, and muted chants.    This formula is repeated, although in a much more taciturn manner, on ~Ghosts Of Reach,~ which employs tribal drums running underneath the swelling symphonic pulses. ~Heretic Hero~ goes for a dark, almost cavernous sound thanks to clanking and whirring rhythms that lay the foundation for the darkly misted electronic swirl that eventually ensues. It presents the listener with a nice, easy going groove. ~Flawed Legacy~ reverts to the chant motif, which bubbles over into rubber band bass line that evolves into a drum track that borders between mildly industrial and tribal while the chants morph into looped repetition. This presents a strong contrast to the piercing string arrangement that leads into the pulsing, chant and throb elements of ~Impend.~   O'Donnell and Salvatori continue to mine the intertwined realms of symphonia and electronica, further implementing the use of layered and reformatted chants to create eerie, hyper-ethereal soundscapes on tracks like ~Ancient Machine,~ which manages to be both ecclesiastical and mechanical at the same time. ~In Amber Clad~ is much more traditional, in terms of symphonic construction, relying upon strings as the foundation before bringing in acid jazz bass keyboards and a somewhat cheesy guitar grind. It's definitely one of the less restrained and atmospheric pieces in the score and its bluntness sets it apart from the rest of the instrumental passagesit sounds more like something crafted by Incubus than any of the other bits scored by O'Donnell and Salvatori.   The remaining elements of score more or less revert to the duo's standard symphonic nuance-meshing with-mild electronic ambiance modus operandi. ~The Last Spartan~ is perhaps the most traditional symphonic piece, focusing mostly on faux string arrangements that create a decidedly militaristic vibe before dropping off into almost a cappella swells of chanting. ~Orbit of Glass~ is a shimmering swirl of white bliss, while ~Heavy Price Paid~ again focuses on the more standardized score elements, although it does dip into an almost solitary ambient tonal mode. With ~Earth City~ the score turns back to the quasi-militaristic grandeur just as ~High Clarity~ slips back into the restrained arena of floating ambience. The final piece of score, ~Remembrance,~ lives up to its name, coming off like a quiet, forlorn eulogy of floating choral voices and an almost angelical sense of sonic space.   As a stand-alone soundtrack, Halo 2 Original Soundtrack And New Music Volume One offers up a few genuine surprises, most notably in the four movements contributed by Incubus and in a fair amount of O'Donnell and Salvatori's more or less engaging score--I would say that about  of their instrumental passages work well outside the elements of the game. But in the end, as with most scores, this one will probably work best when immersed deeply in Halo 2 induced battle mode.", "date": "Nov 9, 2004"}
