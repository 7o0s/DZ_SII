{"name": "Dead or Alive 3", "name_review": "Dead or Alive 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/13/dead-or-alive-3", "text": "When we refer to the ~next level~ of video gaming, it's usually in terms of visuals.  For all the play mechanics, ease of control, and other design innovations a developer can make, the ~next level~ of gaming isn't realized till we see a huge leap in the graphics.  As shallow as that might seem, we are visual creatures after all and as video gamers, our first instinct is to gauge the quality of a game from what we initially see.  After our interest in watching the game has been peaked, then come secondary factors - very important ones - like responsiveness of control, depth of play mechanics, and level of immersion in the gameplay.  These are all important features that we take into account, but if the visuals aren't light years ahead of the previous generation of video games, it's not perceived to be elevating the standard of gaming.  For Dead Or Alive 3, that's not a problem at all; as the most gorgeous 3D fighting game seen to date, the amount of detail and the superfluous visual effects that pierce your retinas - real-time lighting, bump mapping, intricate texture work, and so on - the visuals alone raises the bar of excellence.  Team Ninja could have easily stopped with the visuals and rehashed the same combat engine from Dead Or Alive 2.  But the team didn't stop setting standards in just the graphics as they combined this level of visual quality with subtle but innovative 3D gameplay mechanics incorporating a new standard of strategy never experienced in a 3D fighting game before.  Include responsiveness in control that's intuitive with one of the best multi-player elements in a fighting game, and you've not only introduced the next level for a 3D fighting game, but Dead Or Alive 3 represents the new standard of excellence that only the Xbox can deliver.  As a 3D fighting game, the premise is bluntly straightforward - pummel your opponents with an arsenal of hand-to-hand techniques until they cry for mommy in the fetal position.  The story - a rather unimportant element for any fighting game - remains pretty much the same as it has for the DOA series.  Fighters around the world have entered the DOA tournament for numerous reasons - fame, fortune, revenge, or just to kick some well-textured, polygon ass.  Sixteen fighters make up the roster of selectable characters, many returning favorites from past DOA games and three brand new ones.  As you would think, nearly every character has distinctly different martial art styles with varying strengths and weaknesses (for a more in-depth look at the characters, check out our DOA 3 Fighter Of The Day feature).  A total of fourteen stages keeps the action fresh and exciting; no two matches will be fought the same due to the importance of each fighting area.  For that matter, no two matches will ever look the same thanks in part to the fantastic visual splendor that places Dead Or Alive 3 soaring above any 3D fighting game. ~I keep a drool bucket handy when I play DOA3. It is visually stunning and, well, you've seen the detailed female character models.  Often Anthony and I often spend several hours after work beating and countering each other senseless.  We always say, 'One more game,' but inevitably it turns into 20 more. A more indicative sign of a great game I assure you there isn't.  Granted I'm a bigger Soul Calibur fan, but after having my fill of DOA3 I can say that I easily enjoy it on as many levels, especially when you get involved in a bout with someone talented.  One last point I'd like to note is that I'm a big videophile, and DOA3 runs in 16:9. All together it's a package that screams, 'Fran, buy me, buy me!' all over it.~ -Fran Mirabella, IGNCube Editor Graphicssize> From the animated seagulls on the sunset beach, the amazing wool detail of Bayman's special forces costume, the clouds of pure white powder as fighters circle each other in the snow level, the neon lights that light up the DOATEC HK street levels, the elegant lifelike nature of Lei Fang's silk qipao dress flowing in the wind, the numerous leaves that float of their own accord in forest level... it's easy to go on and on about the spectacular graphic details that adorn DOA3.  Never before in any fighting game, or any video game for that matter, has there been such a godly display of visual detail.  It's almost impossible to talk about the best visual feature in the game because there's such a vast amount of detail in everything you see.  A large amount of the graphic splendor definitely went into designing each of the fourteen stages, each featuring several magnificent visual delights.  It would take too much time (and internet space) to go into detail each of the stages so I'll just talk about my three favorites: DOATEC HK, Forest, and the Tao areas.  The Tao area takes place in an Asian temple-like setting with brittle tiles that crack when you or an opponents gets knocked off their feet.  The architecture in this level is remarkable, but even more impressive is when you crack the tile floors, they remain cracked for the remainder of the fight.  The Forest level is a stunning stage with leaves that flow throughout the fight.  Two wonderful graphic elements are of keynote here: knocking an opponent into a tree will send a light shower of brown leaves fluttering to the ground.  But then as leaves make their slow descent to the ground, if you perform attacks that sweep across the flight of these leaves, they will react accordingly flying with such frightening realism, you have to see it to truly believe it.  Then there's the DOATEC HK. This stage is the epitome of DOA 3 stages; featuring a sparklingly view of the city lights of Hong Kong just as the sun begins to set, you start at the top of the high building.  And in the world of DOA 3 if you start somewhere high, you have to send an opponent falling off the edge.  A trademark standard set in Dead Or Alive 2, DOATEC HK is one of four stages that has multiple levels where you can send the opponent flying off for some tremendous falling damage.  While each of the four multi-tiered stages are equally impressive when you launch a lackey off the edge, DOATEC HK sends them flying through glass level, INTO a neon sign with electric sparks blazing, and finally landing into the brightly lit streets of Hong Kong with a resounding thump.  Anytime you send an enemy down one of these stages, you get some excellent dramatic camera views that really add to the thrill and excitement to this fighting game.  While there's an obvious lift to the graphics in the stage design, the character models have been given the same intricate treatment.  Although the face models haven't been drastically improved, the detail to the costumes is astounding.  Bump mapping is everywhere - decorating a print pattern on Kasumi's outfit, making Hitomi's fighting gloves look like their made of rubber, making Ayane's ninja costume appear to be made of felt.  Characters with metallic-like surfaces - Hayabusa's ninja gear, Bass's biker chains, Lei Fang's shimmering dragon on her dress - are so well-detailed it's just unbelievable. Add in the real-time lighting and it reflects playfully off these metal surfaces.  Running at a super smooth frame rate (yes, 60 fps folks), characters have been given more frames of animation to make them even more life-like in their animations.  They've also made the game so realistic, when character get slammed up against a tree, their limbs almost wrap up around the tree - man it looks like it hurts!  To say this game looks just like DOA 2 is simply ludicrous; after playing DOA 3, DOA 2 looks almost plain in comparison (those of you still unsure, we've done some research about the visual differences just for you).  Another DOA 3 standard that always marks this as a DOA title are the lovely ladies and their ~well-proportioned~ attributes (cue in LL Cool J's ~Jingling Baby~ here).  It's not quite as perverse as it was in DOA 2 but, it's still there for most of us boys to enjoy.   But don't make the mistake in judging this game as shallow just because of the oogle-friendly girls or the bigger mistake in pronouncing Dead Or Alive 3 as just ~great eyecandy.~  Amidst this mountain visual glory lies a innovative gameplay system that is solid as gold. This is definitely one of the best fighting games that I've played to date.  For starters, it's just plain beautiful.  Levels are digital art masterpieces fleshed out with a level of detail never before seen in a fighting game.  The character animation is superb and shows a depth of movement only rivaled by Soul Calibur.  And the gameplay itself is so fast and furious that your pulse can't help but quicken when entering a battle.  With all that and a ton of excellently balanced moves and combos for each character's fighting style, it's no wonder we're all hopelessly addicted to this crazy electronic crack called Dead or Alive 3. - Dan Adams, IGNPC Editor Gameplay It would've been SO easy for Team Ninja to wow the world with the marvelous graphics of Dead Or Alive 3 and leave the gameplay exactly as it was with DOA 2.  Fortunately for us (and unfortunately for the competition), the quality of Dead Or Alive 3's gameplay depth matches its near flawlessness in its visuals.  One of the biggest and most welcome changes to DOA 3 is the easy control and movement of your fighter.  One of my personal gripes with DOA 2 was how sidestepping was implemented, where you have to hold down the Free button and press up or down on the D-pad to initiate a sidestep (yes, you could also use the Analog pad but I never take my thumb off the D-pad in the heat of battle).  This would cause problems since the Free button was also the button you used to initiate counters, a big part of DOA's gameplay.  That has been alleviated in DOA 3; to sidestep you simply press up, up or down, down on the D-pad quickly and you'll start sidestepping.  Controls are incredibly intuitive and responsive; it's rare that I make the movement mistake of ~hopping~ when trying to sidestep.  I do have to admit that diagonal commands on the Xbox controller aren't exactly perfect but once you get used to the controller, you'll be spinning circles around the opponent. DOA 3 keeps the basic button setup: Free, Punch and Kick buttons.  Combining D-Pad commands and button patterns will create a series of different attacks unique to each character.  There are a ton of special moves to learn and master, but the meat and potatoes that every DOA player must learn is the counter.  More so than any other fighting game, the counter system is a major gameplay mechanic that not only keeps the action fast and intense, but gives players of all levels an equal chance in the ring.  To initiate a counter, you press back on the D-pad and the Free button at the same time.  Since attacks come at three different levels - high, middle, and low - you also have to counter accordingly by pressing the Free button and diagonally up/back on the D-Pad for a high counter, the Free button and back for a mid counter, and the Free button and diagonally down/back for a low counter.  Counters have been toned down since DOA 2 so they don't do quite so much damage.  Nonetheless counters are very powerful for two reasons: (1) they can alter the momentum of a game dramatically and (2) counters can interrupt the stagger penalty from your character.  When your fighter receives a particularly heavy blow, there's a possibility that your fighter will stagger a bit, enabling the opponent to follow up with an attack.  By initiating the counter command during this stagger, you'll instantly wake up from the stagger penalty; time this as your opponent tries to follow up with an attack and if you've guessed what type of attack is coming correctly, you will counter his devious attempt.  If it sounds like the counters are too powerful, they're really not; constantly using the counter mechanic without any real thought is very dangerous, especially if you guess incorrectly.  This can lead to a powerful counter blow, another key DOA 3 play mechanic.  When performing an attack, you have to be aware of the speed and distance of your attack.  Should your opponent strike you to interrupt your attack or punish you for a missed attack, you'll be subject to a counter blow that deals more damage and, even more dangerous, may send you airborne.  Counter blows apply to missed counters and throws as well, so don't be too counter happy else you end up in the air... and once in the air, you're helpless until the opponent lets you hit the ground.  One of the greatest features in DOA 3's gameplay mechanics is the ability for any level of player to take the controls and have some decent success their first time out.  How many times have you've tried your hand against a Virtua Fighter 3 player only to be slapped down in a matter of seconds?  The technical learning curve for DOA 3 isn't as steep as Virtua Fighter and that enables novice players to enjoy the game without being too frustrated.  This certainly makes Tag Tea mode, one of the best features in the game, a lot more fun to play; get three other buddies together and get ready to spend hours on end perfecting your tag team strategies no matter how good or bad your friends are.  Does this sound like a game where advanced players will be beat often by scrub players?  While the play mechanics are simpler to understand and the advanced techniques easier to master than other 3D fighting games, what separates a DOA 3 novice player from an advanced player is not only utilizing the counter techniques and special moves at the right time, but strategic positioning.  This is where the jewel of the gameplay depth shines in DOA 3 and what really makes this 3D fighting game revolutionary.  In most 3D fighting games, the strategies in using the environment you fight in are limited to a few wall throws and ring outs.  Dead Or Alive 2 introduced a whole new standard to stage strategies with multi-level stages and enclosed arenas with damaging walls.  But Dead Or Alive 3 takes this concept to the next level and if you really want to excel at the game, you have to learn how to make use of the environments around you.  For example, on the multi-tiered Lost World level, you fight on a relatively small platform where you can easily fall off for some major damage.  With a character like Bass, it would be advantageous to use one of his bigger throws to fling his foe off the cliff, but because of he's a big target and has slow speed, he should stay a safe distance from the cliff.  This is opposite of Christie; her fast speed is accentuated with her extremely useful side step technique, arguably the best side step technique in the game.  A good tactic with Christie on the Lost World stage is to stay close to the edge and bait her enemy into knocking her off the edge.  When the enemy comes with attack, use her side step technique to evade the attack, and slap the foe off the edge.  Using the environments isn't limited to sending an enemy for a long drop; compact stages play to the advantage of grapplers as it keeps the enemy from wandering too far away and gives grapplers with downed throw attacks a better chance of using their lethal throwing techniques.  Additionally, there are several stages with objects players can use to perform wall throws or wall attacks that can do some very heavy damage.  Rather than having players master and memorize hardcore several attack techniques that may take several months to master and turn off more players, DOA 3 puts more emphasis on how one can utilize the 3D backgrounds to their advantage.  This is truly a unique way of making depth for a fighting game; instead of memorizing what combo string to use, how to guard cancel a specific move to cancel out a special move in mid-animation, or how to eliminate the frames of animation for a particular move to increase the speed of an attack, DOA 3 puts emphasis on how players can utilize the environment to gain the advantage.  There's less memorization and more strategic planning on ~how can I get my target to that area of the stage, what do I do to knock him off the edge, and how do I use this tree to get behind my opponent.~  The integration of the environments to increase the depth of strategy is truly unique, and that's what will be the difference between a scrub novice and a tactical master of this game.  Sound Sound in fighting games has always been an afterthought, but DOA 3's sound effects are superb.  There are some really painful-sounding throws that will have you wincing in pain.  Interaction with the 3D environments generally yields some excellent sound effects; good examples include the stone-like shattering when you slam opponents on the tile ground of the Tao level and the short-circuit electric sound effects when you send an opponent into the wall of the X Octagon.  Character voices remain in their normal Japanese voices, something I prefer over the dubbed voices in DOA 2: Hardcore.  The in-game music is a good mix of electronica and heavy guitar riffs but nothing really outstanding.  I'm not a Aerosmith fan so having the band play 'Amazing' isn't something I'm overjoyed about, but it could be worse. Dead or Alive 3 is still the premier visual showcase for the Xbox.  When I first saw it at the spring Tokyo Game Show -- at its very first public display -- it was head and shoulders above anything else on the system, and I think it still is, especially when you compare it to the launch lineup.  Perhaps we'll see its equal in 2002, when the next round of first-party games and Smilebit's projects debut, but for now, it's a technical display to beat anything in the business.  On top of that, of course, it's as fast and fun as Dead or Alive has ever been -- a superior achievement.  - The Reverend Doctor David Smith, IGNPS2 Editor  From the heaps of comments and praise that I've been typing, it's sounding like this is the perfect fighting game ever, right?  Well, almost.  In nearly almost every gameplay aspect, this is pretty close to the best 3D fighting game experience I've ever had, especially when you put in the awesome Tag Team mode feature that essentially makes DOA 3 a totally different game.  Unfortunately, when it comes to play modes and features, DOA 3 isn't exactly bursting at the seams.  You have a Story Mode, Time Attack mode, a pretty fun Survival mode, Tag Tea mode, a Team Battle mode, Versus Mode, a Watch mode where you can watch CPU players go at it, Sparring mode to practice your moves, and the Theater option so you can view the pretty nifty CG end movies of each character.  That seems to be a good number of modes, but you can get pretty tired of Time Attack and Survival mode pretty easily.  It would've been nice if Team Ninja could put in a quest mode of sorts like those found in Soul Calibur and Tobal 2.  There are costumes to unlock as well as some other extras, but you're going to have to work at getting them.  A slightly annoying gripe was the inability to have two players in Sparring mode; while I love the Exercise mode where you're given one attack at a time to practice successfully, it would've been nice to also have two players practice against each other with infinite health.  Then comes my gripe with the last boss.  Those that remember Tengu from DOA 2 will be even more disappointed with the last boss in DOA 3.  I'm not going to give away too much about the last boss; just that he was really no fun to fight.  It's also notable to mention the very minor visual flaws.  They're not necessarily flaws, but I guess more like wants.  For example, I want the water, that looks quite nice, to dynamically react to the players sending ripples up the stream.  You can kick up powdering snow, but on the beach level, you can't kick up sand?  And in the incredible ice caverns, the level looks fantastic but I was kind of expecting the reflection of fighters off the ice floor.  Again, these are more like ~wants~ than gripes; when you're given so much visual delight, you just want more everywhere. For the last few years, the Dead Or Alive series has been the third-stringer in the 3D fighting game world as Tekken and Virtua Fighter battled it out.  Even now, there's a pretty sizeable percentage of gamers that prejudge Dead Or Alive 3 as a cheap thrill featuring big-breasted ladies as the main draw, calling it a turbo charged Virtua Fighter 2, or a less flashy Tekken 3.  To those gamers, it's time to eat those words and welcome, not only a competitor that looks to be the best 3D fighting game, but also the new standard of video gaming.  It's time to realize that Dead Or Alive 3 is nothing like Virtua Fighter or Tekken but a unique 3D fighting game that will definitely change both the way we see the next generation of 3D fighting games, but sets the standard for quality on the Xbox.  Welcome to the next level.", "date": "Nov 13, 2001"}
