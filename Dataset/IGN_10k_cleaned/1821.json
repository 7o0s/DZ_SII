If the gimmick is too outlandish to be believed, the game runs the risk of alienating the very audience it's trying to capture. If, however, the game can subtley employ that gimmick effectively, and make it an integral part of gameplay, then perhaps all is not lost.  Cyberspeed, a futuristic racer from the folks at Mindscape, pulls off their gimmick with such finesse you hardly even know it's there. Basically, your craft hangs from a light beam, much like those suspended rollercoasters they have at big theme parks. Instead of taking turns on the outside, you must hold tight, as flying too fast can pull you off the beam. Passing also presents a problem as all the vehicles are on the same track.   Somehow, it all works. Add to this mix a set of weapons and you've got yourself a good time. Maybe not as good as WipeOut, but fun nonetheless.   Adam Douglas", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
