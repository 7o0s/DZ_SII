The Ducati name is one of the most renowned in the world of motorcycles and the developer's goal with the title was to bring the essence of the bikes, the tradition and lifestyle home.   In order to help do this, ATD has copied the basic presentation and setup of Polyphony's Gran Turismo and replaced the Hondas, Mazdas, Fords and Toyotas with different Ducati motorcycles of different styles and from diverse time periods. However, while steeling GT's magnificent setup and using it for a game based on Ducati motorcycles might be a solid idea, the end product here is not to motorcycle racing what Gran Turismo is to automobile racing.   Gameplay The problem isn't that the developers did a bad job of making use of the same basic scheme as in GT, because that part of the game is fine. Players are given a certain amount of money and are allowed to buy a bike from an assortment of different shops such as the Vintage Showroom, classifieds in Ducati Magazine or your basic dealership.   And with bike in hand, players can perform various upgrades on the motorcycle as money permits and can even buy new leathers and helmets to help them look as good as they think they drive. There are a multitude of races based on the style of bike you have and the licenses that have been obtained, and the developers have even thrown in some cool new stuff that wasn't in Gran Turismo. For example, the game has a cool single- and multiplayer challenge that lets users battle for ownership of the competitor's ride.  And at first site, the gameplay seems to be without problem either, as the bikes prove very easy to ride and there aren't any significant complaints to be made about the physics engine. It's definitely not a motorcycle simulation in any shape or form, but it does offer solid arcade-styled racing action with several cool camera views, including a cockpit like view that lets you see the hands of the rider, and a decent enough sensation of speed in all the views other than third-person.   Where everything falls apart is in the area of computer AI and the general challenge of the game. Most races offered absolutely no challenge from the computer opponents and the biggest factor in determining one's success or failure is avoiding wrecks. Since the AI bikes will make mistakes and will often crash, it's actually much more beneficial to the player to just slow down a lot for turns and take the safe route instead of working hard to find the precise racing lines.   Nine times out of ten, if you simply avoid crashing, you'll win the race and possibly even lap the nearest opponent. Likewise, there are some challenges that'll put you against a computer opponent that will have you beaten in the first 10 seconds of the race with no chance to catch-up. So, even though the game has many things going for it, it's not really that fun to play.   Graphics If you've ever played either Rollcage or Rollcage Stage II, you'll have a good idea of what to expect of Ducati World in the graphics department because it has a similar style to ATD's previous PlayStation releases. Set in mostly darker settings, the developers show that they know the limitations of the system and have found ways to get around some of them. The general texture quality is quite good and the lighting is better than average and the game's only visual flaw is that there are some occasional, and sometimes serious, bouts of slowdown. If not for the slowdown, this would be a very visually compelling software title.   Sound Unlike the rest of the game, the game's audio was impressive on just about every level. The music was especially pleasant and had your typical techno-ish beat to it that's quite similar to the stuff you've likely heard in games like WipeOut or Rollcage. It really sounds great and is the perfect music to listen to when racing around a track on a high-speed motorcycle. The engine sounds vary from bike to bike, but considering that I've never heard the actual engine sounds of the majority of these puppies, there's no way to tell if they are complete authentic or not.  Let's cut to the chase. Ducati World had a whole lot of potential and while ATD did a splendid job in some areas, it really fails in the end because of the odd and inconsistent AI. Unless you just love Ducati to death, you'll be much better off if you get one of the better PlayStation motorcycle racing games currently available, such as Moto Racer World Tour.", "date": "Feb 2, 2001"}
