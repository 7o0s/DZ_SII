{"name": "Blitzkrieg: Rolling Thunder", "name_review": "Blitzkrieg: Rolling Thunder", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/17/blitzkrieg-rolling-thunder", "text": "is the second standalone expansion for CDV's World War 2 strategy game Blitzkrieg. Where the previous expansion focused on Erwin Rommel, this new expansion centers on the World War 2 career of Old Blood and Guts himself George Patton. Though the new standalone expansion focuses on one of the more dramatic generals of the war, it does little to move the gameplay or graphics forward. You can read our review of the core game here.  There are six three-mission campaigns, each depicting a chapter in the wartime career of George Patton. You begin with the Allied landings in Africa. The game takes it a little easy on you in these early missions but the challenge level ramps up pretty quickly. This won't pose much of a problem for veterans of the original Blitzkrieg or Burning Horizon but newcomers to the series will likely find themselves overwhelmed fairly early in the game.  After taking care of Operation Torch in North Africa, Patton moves to three missions depicting the invasion of Sicily. The rest of the game takes place in Europe, starting with the D-Day landings all the way through to the final assaults on the last Nazi positions in Bohemia. Along the way you'll lead Patton's forces in offensive missions like the assault on Palermo and defensive missions like the defense of the Falaise Pocket.  There are some smaller scale commando missions but most of the time you'll be leading massive armies against numerous opponents. Most are designed with an eye towards historical detail but you can opt to play fictitious variants of at least a few missions. It's not like they won't be tough enough as it is though. In addition to managing assaults on enemy positions, you'll sometimes have to take other special factors into consideration. One mission, for instance, requires you to leave certain enemy buildings untouched as they hold Allied POWs.  The number of units under your control and the pace of the missions creates almost as big a challenge in terms of management as the enemy will in terms of tactics. Infantry are led now in companies and this eases the burden somewhat, but the lack of locked formations and substandard pathfinding leads to disorganization. It's also hard to tell how many units are still in a given grouping and how much they've been damaged without checking them individually on the game map.  In terms of the pacing, there are a few missions that require you to act very quickly right off the bat. Sometimes you'll find your units are being attacked right as the mission starts. Thankfully, you can pause the game and queue up orders for all of your units. In some missions, this is an absolute necessity, particularly those that ask you to set up defensive positions from one edge of the map to the other. Unfortunately for these defensive missions, some of your units won't automatically fire on enemies meaning you'll have to travel up and down your lines, making sure that your anti-tank guns are actively firing on approaching enemies.  One new feature has been added. Where the previous game required you to undertake alternate missions in order to recruit new units, Rolling Thunder now awards unique units for the completion of optional objectives within the regular missions. These are typically objectives along the main mission path anyway, so grabbing them shouldn't be too terribly difficult.   The graphics are definitely starting to look dated. The infantry sprites are too small to pick out certain types of infantry at a glance and the vehicle models are a bit rough. Effects are a year or so behind the standards for the genre as established by more recent games. The new winter models for the buildings and units are a nice addition. The weapon sounds are good but the rest of the game's audio palette could use some work. The voice work is of good quality but it gets far too repetitive far too quickly. I like Rolling Thunder but it really doesn't offer anything new. It's almost exactly the same experience that the core game offered over a year and a half ago. If you've played some of the other recent World War 2 real-time strategy offerings, both the gameplay and graphics of Rolling Thunder seem dated. And while fans of the Blitzkrieg model will obviously enjoy these new missions, the recent Codename Panzers and Soldiers: Heroes of World War 2 are more satisfying and original.", "date": "Nov 17, 2004"}
