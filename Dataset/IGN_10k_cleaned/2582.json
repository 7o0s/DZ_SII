One of the earliest PSOne offerings from the same era as Beyond the Beyond and Suikoden, King's Field has lingered in obscurity for what seems like eons. In the deeper, darker recesses of the Role-Playing crowd however, an airtight brotherhood of Field Worshipers have risen from the shadows and proclaimed the greatness of their franchise like there's no tomorrow.   Intrigued by their dedication and enthusiasm to such a series, I fired up From Software's newest offering with high hopes and expectations, I am after all one of the biggest RPG junkies in the office, and remembered how much I dug the original games all those years ago. Much to my chagrin, the end product wasn't exactly what I was looking for.   Story Plot-wise the Ancient City was a nice change of pace from the usual ~save the world from certain doom~ line that permeates the genre. There aren't any cataclysmic events, all-powerful demigods, or undying visitors from another world jumping in front of our hero at every turn. Instead our story focuses on the older than dirt township known only as ~The Land of Disaster~; A once flourishing city that was quickly abandoned for unknown reasons.   Many years pass until apparently the neighboring country of Heladin had acquired the mysterious idol of sorrow. A spooky icon spawned from the Land of Disaster, the king and his countrymen have been plagued by misfortune from the moment of its appearance. Intent on getting to the bottom of their decline, the King sends his finest sword master and an army of warriors to the ghost town to face whatever evil or mischief is behind their speedy decline. They were never seen or heard from again.   Later still the tale turns to the kingdom of Azalin, where a hooded wanderer visits Prince Devian in his chambers. ~Return this idol to the Land of Disaster so that other kingdoms do not succumb to its wicked curse.~ He says. And with that, he hands the prince the fabled idol of sorrow and disappears. Friends with the missing Sword Master, Devian makes the decision to partake in the quest, and that's where player control begins.   It's also where the intrigue and mystery stops being effective. Slowly unveiled over time, the linear and paper-thin plot never really picks up any steam. After multiple hours of looking for some hint of interest, I forgot what I was doing there in the first place. Talking to pointy-eared freaks, cowardly soldiers, and sickly mothers and the only thing I could determine from the first couple of playing was that everyone who lived in the game was a champion of self-pity.   Make it all the way to the end, and you're still shrugging your shoulders in disbelief. ~That's it?~ you'll wonder, ~There's nothing else to see?~ Lonely and barren to say the least, NPC interaction is so nondescript that I might have well not talked to anyone. It honestly wouldn't have made any difference. One of the key elements to any Role-Playing game an un-fleshed story is the equivalent of no blocking techniques in a fighter. There definitely should have been more by way of plot.      Graphics Visually King's Field is one strange cookie. When the game is still it has to be one of the most beautiful RPG's I've seen in ages, and is a screenshot lovers dream. Excellent varied textures and decent lighting effects certainly help set the stage, and unlike past King's Field titles people actually have faces now (the Beastmaster inspired no-puss from the older offerings are long gone). Extra details like cracks, watering holes, and spider webs throw the atmosphere up another notch, and fog and dust particles are used in just the right places.   Once you push up on the analog stick however things aren't quite as rosy. With a break-up and draw-in problem from hell, random enclosures become a haven for ugly shapes you never thought existed. Misaligned seams, fuzzy indefinable glitches, and other bothersome intrusions are all over the land. The biggest chink in the visual armor though has to be the horrible frame rate.   Choppier than Master Onion, you can almost hear the PS2 chugging along shot by shot with every sorrowful step. Topping off at what looks like 20 frames per second, the shoddy movement effect gave the whole office the red-eye. For two straight weeks I could hear the sound effects filling the air behind me as my colleagues did their best Jones impression from Police Academy.  Them: ~So that's King's Field 4 eh?~  Me: ~Yeah, what do you think?~  Them: ~What's up with the chop?  Me: ~I don't know, I've been playing it for some time now and it doesn't seem to improve. Maybe it's just in certain areas, and later on it'll get better~  Of course I never got a reply. Usually just a blank look, a pat on the back, and a silent moment of repose before they walked away.   Sound The audio effects are way off, with wooden clubs that sound like swords when you smash another wooden barrel and swords that sound like glass when you stab a skeleton. Luckily the narrator's spooky delivery during cutscenes and the subtle soundtrack help to take your mind off of it.   Granted some of the musical tracks are a tad repetitive and the amount of tunes to listen to is limited, but the dynamically changing score keep it interesting with a couple of genuinely haunting tracks that allowed me stop my dungeon jaunt and listen. All in all however, the ear candy wasn't too mentionable either way.      Gameplay Depth is what helps save King's Field from the world of mediocrity. The level of control over your character is most assuredly a nice bonus as you can equip armor on just about every major body part. Upgradeable weaponry, a plethora of magic spells, some minor puzzles, and a straightforward yet clever stage-design are all plusses in the happy checklist of love. Another neat little touch is the need to change your arsenal frequently to meet different enemy situations. Up against some zombie miner guy? Slash his ass with a sword ninja style. Find yourself head-to-head with a reanimated skeleton? Bash his skull in with your styling morning star. Controlled violence is your friend.   Control is also a synch with strafing easily executed via the shoulder buttons and the analog sticks working perfectly as your forward and look-view command. Menus, attacks, magic, and even a customized shortcut button for whatever you'd like make getting the job done a lot easier, with only the unacceptable frame-rate getting in the way.   The real problem is found in finding something to do. Long and uneventful, King's Field can get boring fast. Sparse enemies, long uninhabited hallways, and gigantic openings with a couple of beetle creatures does not excitement make. Hardcore Fielders who are used to all this will probably not mind at all, but hungry RPG fans looking for something to match the giants like Final Fantasy and Zelda are in for a big letdown. When they said deserted city they meant it.   Oh and for those of you who are frustrated easily, be warned; King's Field is hard (especially pre-level 10). Unforgiving and slow, combat can quickly take your full health character and turn him into one dead burrito. Hours and hours of real time play can translate into 30 minutes of game time, make sure you write those saves often! King's Field: The Ancient City is an okay venture into the world of first-person role-players. Long and challenging (although not necessarily for the right reasons), desperate adventurers could find a lot to like. But for the pickier bunch of us out there who demand a deeper story, more action, and an over all tighter package may opt to rent this one over the weekend", "date": "Mar 27, 2002"}
