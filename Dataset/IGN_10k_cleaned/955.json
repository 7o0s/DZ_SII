{"name": "Buster Bros. Collection", "name_review": "Buster Bros. Collection", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/04/22/buster-bros-collection", "text": "After numerous delays, Capcom's Buster Bros. Collection has finally been released for the PlayStation. Comprising three older Buster Bros. games (Buster Bros., Super Buster Bros., and the never before released  Buster Buddies), the Collection offers quite a bit of bang for the buck, although after a while the differences between the three games becomes minimal. Buster Bros. Collection succeeds because it works on the same basic level that made so many old Atari 2600 games great: it's wonderfully simple, yet incredibly challenging. The premise for Buster Bros. is admittedly strange: balloons bounce around a 2D room, and its your job to shoot them with spiked chains. As the balloons pop, they split into smaller balloons until they've all been popped. As the balloons segment, it becomes more and more difficult to avoid them. Strange, yes, but oddly addicting.    While it's no graphics showcase for the PlayStation, Buster Bros. holds your attention for one, very important reason: gameplay. Control of the characters is rock solid, and mastering each one's wire or gun is easy enough. Buster Bros. follows the old-school game 2D code to the letter, with power-ups that drop from the top of the screen to slow time or increase your firepower. Perhaps this is what makes the game so fun - even if you haven't played it, you already know what to expect. Buster Bros. Collection does have its shortcomings, though, most notably in the graphics department. The game is starting to look a little dated, even with the inclusion of pre-rendered characters in Buster Buddies. (Thankfully, DonPacos' name was changed for the American version from the slightly less politically correct DonTacos.)  Fans of old-school games may enjoy Buster Bros. Collection for its simplicity and 2D nostalgia, which is fine, but it's always nice to see something groundbreaking too.", "date": "Apr 22, 1997"}
