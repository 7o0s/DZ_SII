It's instantly recognizable, and thanks to some great flicks and video games, the brand is associated with quality. Which is one of the reasons Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Rooftops is something of a disappointment. Like New York City itself, it has some spectacular views, but the underbelly can be real ugly.   Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Rooftops is comprised of a handful of multi-level mini-games that require rhythm and skill to complete. These mini-games, though, are an absolute mixed bag, as some are fun and other numbingly frustrating to no end. But it must be said that no matter the caliber of the mini-game, everything is given the star treatment with good visuals and a great respect for the license itself.   One of the mini-game has you climbing the side of a building as Doctor Octopus unfurls his tentacles toward you. You have three Spider Sense indicators at the top of the screen that light up when a tentacle is about to drop down that third of the route. You then have a split-second to get out of the way. This is deceptively easy at first, but by the time you score high enough to play the third level, the tentacles come down almost too fast and in the frenzy of dodging, you can lose track of which of the three columns you are standing in. The fact that the camera is located to the side of the building, not behind you, doesn't help -- but it does provide a 3D view.   On top of the building, you must confront a series of thugs. Using the number pad, you must play a game of Dance Dance Revolution hitting number sequences as they pass through a sensor at the top of the screen. Miss a number and the thug gets the drop on you. Hit them all, and then nail the ~OK~ key when the Spider symbol crosses the mark and you'll pull of a web-slinging move to finish them off without being attacked at all. Do yourself a favor a turn the music off during this mini-game, as the numbers do not move in the rhythm of the music. The game is much easier when you can just concentrate on the numbers.   The next game has you crawling back down the building, avoiding more tentacles. The fourth sequence shows you swinging between rows of skyscrapers, filling a meter on the top of the screen to make the next successful swing. This game is good fun, and probably the best of the bunch since it's not only the fun kind of challenging, but the camera is your friend, too. Finally, you confront Doc Ock directly, throwing webbing into his tentacles to stop his advancing attacks. This is a feverish mini-game, and also far more entertaining than the first two challenges.   Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Rooftops is a looker, no doubt. The Spider-Man model looks good, complete with an accurate costume. But it's the animations that are truly the crowd-pleaser. When you are fighting bad guys on the rooftops, Spidey will wind them up in his web and then fling them to the ground triumphantly. And smoothly. The in-game music is solid, too.Spider-Man 2 3D: NY Rooftops isn't a home run, but it's a solid double. The visuals are more pleasing than the game itself, which is an assemblage of mini-games of varying success. Some of them are simple, some are fun, some are maddening -- and not in that ~gotta keep tryin'~ maddening way, either. More in the ~I'm going to throw this $300 phone~ kind of maddening. And, well, I certainly don't want you to do that. Then you can't watch ~Daily Show~ clips.", "date": "Feb 3, 2005"}
