Based directly on the bestselling PC game, the mobile Company of Heroes offers turn-based strategy gaming between warring Axis and Allies factions for the fate of the free world. This is not new stuff -- it's essentially Advanced Wars meets Call of Duty -- but the easy-to-use controls and clean interface make this a worthy look for gamers needing a little go-time with the Greatest Generation while taking the cross-town express.   After completing a mercifully short tutorial, you begin a series of campaigns against the evil Axis forces. The game employs all of the necessary staples of the genre. During your turn, you use a grid to move units across the environment, setting up advantageous positions for launching attacks, and taking strongholds. Naturally, terrain figures heavily into your war machine's chances for victory. Ducking into a bombed-out building gives a team of riflemen a higher defensive rating than if they were simply in tall grass.   A basic turn goes as such: You move into position to fire on advancing German units. You must your grenadiers into a city block for protection while riflemen draw enemy fire. You inch closer so the enemy is within range -- allowing you to move and attack in the same turn. You cannot just push out and attack without abandon; you must carefully zero in on priority targets while in full force. Is a dug in enemy unit proving hard to hit? Call in an airstrike. After all of your units have moved, you end the turn and hope against hope you didn't leave anybody as a sitting duck for a German sniper you missed.   Each unit has different stats and attacks that must be weighed and balanced while planning your assaults. Before a battle, you get to choose which units to take into the field. Grenadiers, for example, can really dish it out but versatile riflemen are always useful. Snipers can be lethal, but are decidedly weak once spotted. In early missions, you can usually pull out a win with any reasonable variation, but you will soon have to start taking all factors of a campaign into consideration -- terrain, enemy units, etc. -- when planning your away team. As you push deeper into the game, new units become available, such as tanks.   Company of Heroes has seven campaign missions that should take you some time to complete. Each mission has primary and secondary objectives, so if you've enjoyed the first run at the game, you have reason to give Company another go-around. After finishing off the campaign, you can enter a skirmish mode and choose specific battlefields. You can also try your hand at the Axis forces to see if you have the stones to bring down the valiant Allies.   Company of Heroes was tested on a Sony Ericsson w810i. The commands are easy to use, thanks to a clean interface. The screen isn't cluttered with unnecessary information -- everything is useful and simple to read. The different environments (dirt roads, bombed-out cities, craters, grasslands) are decently detailed. Units, however, are so small and bunched together that your men looks more like blobs of brown and gray than defined soldiers. The game music is pretty good.  Company of Heroes is a solid strategy game that adheres to genre conventions -- there are no surprises in this game: Move, attack, and end turn. After playing more than a few of these games, I found myself getting a wee bit bored of seeing the same mechanics again and again. However, the setting and atmosphere is well-done and I really liked how developer Viva la Mobile stuck close to missions from the PC game. That's the kind of thing that fosters crossover appeal. Controls are easy to use and the interface makes it easy to get right into the thick of a fight. If you're looking for a strategy game, appreciate the World War II setting, and don't mind getting all the staple mechanics again, THQ Wireless' latest will get your thumbs enlisted for a few hours.", "date": "Apr 26, 2007"}
