I've seen it in arcades, on the Dreamcast, and briefly on the Game Boy Color months ago, but in all honesty I never thought too much of the game. And now that I've actually had an opportunity to wrap my grubby paws around the game for an extended period of time, I feel justified in my initial impression -- Mr. Driller on the Game Boy Color is a nice diversion from the normal action/puzzle fare, but this is definitely not ~classic~ material. Features Easy mode Hard mode Survival mode Only for Game Boy Color Mr. Driller is an odd combination of Dig Dug and Puyo Puyo Sun  the whole idea is to dig through a huge stack of colored blocks before your air runs out. Mr. Driller can drill down, to the left and right, and even above him  but gravity is a serious gameplay element here. In other words, your character and the blocks will fall downward if there's nothing holding them up. If you drill a colored block that's connected to other blocks of the same color, you'll wipe out that entire grouping  causing the blocks on top to settle into the bin. And when this happens, chain reactions can, and will, occur, since groupings of the same colors will lock into each other and disappear if they get four or more blocks large.  Now, the goal is to get all the way down to the bottom of the pit  five hundred feet down and you'll get to the next level, and the game ends when you reach the very bottom (2500 feet for easy, 5000 feet for hard). While it sounds like it's a simple matter of just drilling downward until you reach the goal, there are a few elements that prevent this from being anything as easy as that. First of all, you've got a continuous depleting air meter, and if it runs out you lose a life. To refill this meter, you have to pick up these capsules that give you 20% of your air back. Some are easily acquired, but others are blocked off by ~X~ blocks that are difficult to get rid of  you'll have to connect four X blocks together to wipe them out, or drill through them which takes five button presses. The problem here is, if you drill these X blocks, you lose 20% of your air. These X blocks are the only real element that gives Mr. Driller its necessary challenge.  The problem with Mr. Driller is simple to point out  there's just not much to it. The game lacks a real sense of strategy since Mr. Driller focuses more on the maniacal element of getting to the bottom as quickly as possible. The only real thought involved in the game is in how you're going to wipe out X blocks to gain access to a trapped air capsule. And it also lacks in the options, too  you've got an ~easy~ mode, a ~hard~ mode, and a ~survival~ mode (essentially the easy and hard modes, but you only get one life). The game lets you put in your name after a high score, but since the cartridge lacks a battery, those names and scores are lost when the power switch is flipped. Without the high score save, there's nothing to shoot for  other than the default programmers' scores, of course. It would have been great to have one of those ~puzzle~ modes that designers throw into these chain-reaction games...you know, where you have a specific number of moves to wipe out the entire field of blocks. And a link-cable mode for two players would have been awesome. But nope  this is a rather limiting Game Boy Color cartridge with not much to it.  Mr. Driller is definitely not of the same caliber as Tetris, Klax, or Puyo Puyo Sun in terms of a puzzle game, and as an action game it lacks a lot of variety to egg you on to later levels. As a Game Boy Color game, Mr. Driller is a nice five or ten minute diversion, but it doesn't have much to keep you going for more than that.", "date": "Aug 11, 2000"}
