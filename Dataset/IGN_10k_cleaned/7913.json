You spike the guy with a wooden stake, he comes back. You douse him with holy water, not enough. You throw back the curtains, let the sunshine in, watch him burn to cinders right before your eyes  he'll still be back for the sequel. Dracula just won't die, but it's always fun to try killing him again. Enter Super Castlevania IV.   Originally marketed as a sequel to its three NES predecessors, Konami's fourth installment in the Castlevania series was really more of a remake. It told anew the story of Simon Belmont's first adventure  Simon Belmont, the vampire hunter cursed by his bloodline to a fate of eternal conflict against Transylvania's dark and undead overlord. Super Castlevania IV opens with the whip-wielding warrior setting off across the countryside, felling Dracula's forces on a winding path towards the Count's castle  a path that takes the hero through monster-infested forests, caves and lakesides before ending in Castlevania itself.    Even more diverse and engaging levels are found there, calling attention to Super Castlevania IV's first great strength  level design. Konami took advantage of the new 16-bit hardware and crafted some truly unique environments for players to experience, like the Mode 7-powered rotating room of Level 4, and the glittering, golden castle treasury that still holds up as one of the series' most memorable stages.   What hasn't held up for the series are stages themselves  modern 2D Castlevanias are presented in ~Metroidvania~ style, each environment interconnected and interwoven into a multi-directional tapestry of blocked-off passageways and necessitated backtracking. In 1991, though, that formula hadn't yet been adopted. SCIV features straightforward stage progression with no multiple paths. Each playthrough of the game is the same.   Oddly, that was a backstep for the series at the time. Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse had innovated by allowing players to choose from several different routes to take to the final conflict with the Count, and had also introduced alternate playable characters beyond the standard Belmont. In that light, the gameplay of this sequel seems limited. A weakness? Not really. More of a refocusing.   Keeping the stage progression linear and the playable heroes singular allowed Konami's team to fixate on the original, core concepts of Castlevania and expand on them. One man, alone, facing the forces of darkness with a whip  ah, the whip. What can we do with that? SCIV's second great strength  weapon mechanics. Simon's famous flail gained some versatility in this outing, as it can be commanded to strike in eight directions, spun and slung in circles, held forward as a projectile shield and used as a method of transportation to swing across otherwise impassable platform gaps.   Simon himself still feels stiff, a sense of rigidity existing in his motions as a holdover from the NES days. But the expanded capabilities of his signature weapon do a lot to make playing the hero more immersive. And getting into the game world is additionally assisted by the title's third great strength  sound design.   Castlevania games have always been known for their music, and Super Castlevania IV is one of the early reasons why. The soundtrack featured here is rich and deep, with compositions and arrangements that were well beyond anything heard on a console Nintendo system before. Even now, years later, it's easy to be impressed. This was one of the first ever SNES games  but Konami's audio engineers managed to immediately master the hardware's potential for engaging sound.   Inspired level design, unique gameplay mechanics and a soundtrack of such quality that it shocked the gamers of the day to hear it  three great strengths that make this fourth Castlevania title one to definitely consider for download to your Virtual Console channel array. Dracula didn't die for good at the end of this quest. But fans who've taken up the fight against the Count on more modern systems and missed out on the originating titles of the series would be well advised to revisit this, one of the most interesting and intriguing quests in Transylvania's past.  Super Castlevania IV's first release came during the launch window for the SNES, making it to market just in time for Christmas back in 1991. It was only appropriate, then, for its Virtual Console debut to come during the game's 15th anniversary, as it debuted for download as a surprise on Christmas Day, 2006.  Though it was re-issued for the SNES a few years after '91, this is the first time since the 16-bit era that Super Castlevania IV has been made available in America. If you're a fan of the whip-cracking series or even just well designed action platformers, SCIV is certainly worth your Points.", "date": "Jan 12, 2007"}
