{"name": "Chessmaster 10th Edition", "name_review": "Chessmaster 10th Edition", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/27/chessmaster-10th-edition", "text": "The essential contradiction at the heart of this review is this: While I think Chessmaster is simply the best chess program available, the small list of new features added to each iteration make it hard to recommend the new version over the previous one. So while we can say that Chessmaster 10th Edition is the best chess game in town, it simply doesn't add enough over any of the last two versions to make it a necessary upgrade.  It seems bizarre. Each edition of Chessmaster is better than the last but the world of computerized chess hardly requires four separate editions over five years. While it makes some sense that successive iterations of Madden can tweak the action somewhat, that flexibility just doesn't exist in the more abstract, straightforward world of chess. The same is true of graphics technology. And where Microsoft's Flight Simulator series necessitates almost yearly editions to keep pace with improvements in graphics technology, chess games don't (and shouldn't) sell on the strength of their visuals.  So how do you keep the series fresh? Going back over previous versions, I can definitely see some incremental improvements. Chessmaster 8000 added the new King AI system and introduced a lot of teaching tools. And while that game's switch to 16-bit graphics made it stand out a bit from the previous versions, you'd be hard pressed to say that the improvement made that big of a difference in terms of your enjoyment of the game. Chessmaster 9000 added even more teaching tools and brought back the much-missed Chessmaster Live multiplayer options.  Chessmaster 10 includes yet another update for the King AI system, more learning courses, a less cumbersome interface and a pair of 3D glasses. And while it offers some new features, you can pretty much read our reviews of the previous games and substitute ~10~ for ~8000~ or ~9000.~   The King AI system has been improved again but, as I've said when it was introduced in Chessmaster 8000 and then strengthened in Chessmaster 9000, the higher limits of the AI are well beyond any player's ability to distinguish them. If you can't pick up a rock that weighs four-hundred pounds, would you feel more challenged trying to pick up a rock that weighs 420 pounds? At this level, only Grandmasters are likely to notice an improvement.  Thankfully, there are a range of opponents to choose from of all sorts of skill levels. This edition brings the total number of players up over 200. To help you get a leg up on the more skilled AI players, there are all kinds of learning tools here. Waitzkin reprises his role as teacher, showing players the basics of the game, while Larry Christiansen offers comments on another set of games. This new version includes the learning sessions found in the previous games. The previous couple of games have come with almost half a million recorded games, and this latest addition includes more than 50,000 new games that have been played in the two years since Chessmaster 9000 was released.  The windows-heavy presentation of the previous games has been lessened quite a bit in this new version. I still think that too much of the screen's surface is taken up by things that aren't the game board but you can easily move the windows around (or remove them altogether) in order to get a better view of the action. Sadly Chessmaster 10 suffers from an abundance of options that makes navigation between game types and teaching tools slightly confusing. After a few hours, you'll learn where everything is soon enough.  35 chess sets are included with this latest edition so there's bound to be something that suits your mood at any given time. Personally, some of the sets are a bit too abstract for easy piece recognition but if you stick with it, you'll soon learn to read the board well enough. Cooler still, this marks the first time that the series has included animated sets. While there's a certain coolness to the fantasy-themed sets, this isn't Battle Chess so you won't see lots of terribly exciting combat animations. The Queen in the kiddie set drops a pink elephant on her enemies but most of the time a simply sword swipe is all you see.  And now we come to what is quite possibly one of the silliest additions the series has ever seen, the 3D glasses. Why in the world someone thought to gussy up this package with a technology usually associated with 1950s black and white horror movies is beyond me. In any case, Chessmaster 10 comes with a set of those red and blue glasses that bring the game to life in glorious stereoscopic 3D. I have to admit that the effect is initially impressive but the novelty soon wears off, particularly if you're trying to fit the glasses onto a head as large as mine.  For whatever reason, this latest edition of Chessmaster does not support Windows 95 or 2000. Though the previous version had the same shortcoming some people seemed able to run the game fine on those operating systems. There's no word yet as to whether this is the case with Chessmaster 10. The series itself remains the best way to play and learn about chess on the PC. The teaching tools are comprehensive enough to introduce you to all the major concepts and the catalog of recorded games serves as an invaluable resource. Still, considering that you can still get Chessmaster 9000 for twenty bucks, I don't see much reason to go with this newest 10th edition if you're not a serious student of the game. You get a $10 rebate if you own an earlier version, but that only brings the cost of this new edition down to $30.", "date": "Aug 27, 2004"}
