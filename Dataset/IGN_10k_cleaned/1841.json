After passing through two previous systems and as many revisions, Onimusha Warlords comes with heavy bag of goods. The game delivers a mixture of fantastic, one could even say gorgeous, visuals, usually bathed in blood and gore, while other images, especially the CG, are so highly refined and spectacular that they must be watched repeatedly to catch the full depth of their vibrancy, color, and realism. Whichever way one looks at Onimusha, it leaves an indelibly deep impression.   If one were to look at Capcom as an experimental game lab, then Onimusha would definitely represent the newest set of tricks. After nearly five years of the Resident Evil stock elements, cinematic still shots, awkward action sequences, and endless hours of backtracking for obscure puzzles pieces, Capcom's Onimusha is the experiment that stretches the concept to its limits, and then tries to break free of the paradigm. In some ways, the game works, in other ways, Onimusha is still squarely trapped in Raccoon City.   The point is that Onimusha, on the whole, is a worthy, exciting experience. Capcom's game rolls out a good story, an exceptional weapon-based upgrade and combat system, an exquisite set of visuals previously not seen on PlayStation 2, and a truly unique orchestral soundtrack. Onimusha works on many levels, and delivers such a high quality of production values, that, along with SSX, Madden, Sky Odyssey, and Star Wars Starfighter, it's one of the PlayStation 2's absolute must-have titles.   The Story Much in the way that Resident Evil games have unfolded the Raccoon City stories, Onimusha begins with one of the greatest CG intros of all time, and then follows up with gameplay that unveils a little bit of story at a time, woven together with CG and in-game cutscenes. The paradigm is still one of the best in videogames today and its works almost perfectly here. The severity and seriousness of the game is portrayed in the game's five-minute opening sequence. Inspired by the dramatic battles and stories from movies made by Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa, Onimusha has taken on major significance for Capcom. It's one of the most expensive games ever made by the Japanese company, and it will be heavily marketed with a North American budget that's just short of $10 million.   Featuring movie-style production values, Onimusha: Warlords tells the story of an epic, 16th century saga, wherein warlords fought brutal hand-to-hand battles for power over Japan. The game sews historical accounts and Capcom's and Flagship's own fictional storylines into one drama about a girl, an ambitious warlord, and an altruistic warrior. Taking place in Feudal Japan (1560), Onimusha is set in the period of civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda, the ruthless warlord who came within a hair's breadth of unifying Japan. The game involves players in Nobunaga's quest to take over all of Japan. Nobunaga has just defeated warlord Yoshimoto Imagawa in a surprise night attack and is preparing for the next attack on Yoshitatsu Saito's famous Inabayama Castle in the Mino Prefecture.   Lead character Samanosuke Akechi, whose movements were drawn from Japanese actor/heartthrob Takeshi Kaneshiro, must save the young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu, who has been kidnapped for sinister purposes. Samanosuke is a natural swordsman, having returned from a youth spent wandering the nation with a strong sense of justice and remarkable ability, but he clearly doesn't realize the obstacles put before him. Standing in his path is a legion of demon warriors who protect the princess. And after his failure to prevent the princess' assassination, Samanosuke is drawn into a deep dream, in which the leader of the Ogre clan gifts him with a magic gauntlet, capable of unsaid abilities. With the Gauntlet strapped to his right arm, Samanosuke is able to absorb the souls of evil creatures and gains strength in doing do.   Onimusha drifts from history just a trifle; leading the undead army is Nobunaga, who dies before his time in the amazing introductory FMV with an arrow through the throat. After accepting a pact with the lord of the demons, Fortinbras, he is resurrected by demon powers to carry out his ambitions. Along with his ninja sidekick Kaede, Samanosuke must rescue the princess and stop the demons from the dark ceremony that will surely tip the balance of power in favor of Nobunaga.   Although most gamers will thoroughly enjoy Onimusha's intriguing story, it ends without tying up many of its threads. Strange creatures who aren't ever named in the manual appear and disappear without a trace, their purpose never explained (the snail-headed bad guy), and while the end is meant to remain ambiguous, the story leaves one yearning for a stronger sense of closure. While in the past the Resident Evil series has almost always sewn up its plot threads, Onimusha concludes with a nullifying epilogue that simply doesn't take into consideration all that has happened in the game on the deepest levels. The fluffy game manual doesn't help clarify anything either.   Gameplay For those folks familiar with Resident Evil or Dino Crisis, Onimusha should feel easy and familiar to control. Onimusha controls with the digital pad for movement, Square functions as attack, Circle absorbs souls, X is action/open door, decide, and Triangle is special move/cancel. Players can perform a 180 move with R2, while they block with L1. The inventory system is also classic RE. In fact, one of the items you find is an herb! And of course you can combine items for more powerful ones.   The big change in Onimusha is two-fold. First, the game is 85% action, 15% adventure/puzzle solving. It's really an action game with Resident Evil trappings. Samanosuke and Kaede move quickly in any direction; they can strafe, and they rapidly move forward or backward for attacks. Attacks are simple and almost automatic once the Square button is pushed. If you pound the button, a single rush-forward-swipe smoothly transforms into a triple attack. By pressing R1 while attacking, players will automatically attack the closest enemy, regardless of whether they are behind or in front of you. The control scheme is much better than it ever was in the Resident Evil or Dino Crisis games. It's fast, and relatively agile, and the response time is nearly perfect.   Once an enemy is downed, players can engage in a nice touch of carnage by thrusting their sword downward into the chest of their opponents, spraying a wave of blood across the area. This move is phenomenally satisfying, and in the first couple hours of the game, players are sure to perform it as often as possible. I did. When an enemy is killed its soul floats into the air and Samanosuke can then absorb it in the gauntlet for points.   While Samanosuke is the primary character, the game will automatically switch you from him to Kaede. She also performs immensely cool ninja moves, such as jumping over an enemy's head and slitting their throat from behind, and she also wields throwing knives. Unlike in Resident Evil, players can shoot up or down easily, with auto-aim locking. Samanosuke also acquires a gun with upgradeable rounds and a bow and arrow, with upgradeable fire arrows. During the game, players switch automatically between both characters, each of whom can access different parts of the environment.   Despite the massive upgrade in combat control, the control scheme is still somewhat hampered. The characters never look incredibly realistic in their movements, but instead look just shy of robotic -- I'm specifically talking about running and walking sequences. The attack sequences and fighting scenes are quite impressive. But the overall lack of fluidity and smooth movement in the rest of the game detracts from the otherwise phenomenal looking piece of code.   The classic set-shot camera angles are, as always, a double-edged sword. The theory behind the set-camera angles was always to create a wide variety of moods and emotions, much the same way movies do. That part of the theory still works. The strategic placement of cameras to create surprise, shock, or fear still does the job. What doesn't work now, and has never worked, is fighting enemies who attack from around a blind corner. In this set up, narrow corridors cause a great amount of frustration because enemies, even sub-boss level enemies, may attack from blind spots, therefore punishing you for rounding a corner, or outside the camera's perspective. It doesn't help that you can't block and walk, or walk run and shoot, at the same time. There are numerous other examples, but I'm sure you've all heard them before. In the end, the game functions well enough, but this problem, which has shown up in the very first Resident Evil is still completely unaddressed. Thus, I must resort to bluntness -- Hey Capcom! Fix the damn cameras! Make it right.   The second part of the control scheme that's incredibly cool is the collection and upgrade qualities of the swords themselves. Samanosuke collects three swords in his travels, a Thunder (a quick blue sword), Fire (a giant, heavier red sword) Sword, and a Wind Sword (a lighting-quick double-ended green sword), each with their own effects on various creatures. Along with each sword comes a magic orb. By collecting the souls of enemies (a la Soul Reaver) Samanosuke powers up each sword at a save point (by selecting ~Enhance~), and can delegate the power to the sword or the orb. The swords and orbs are upgradeable to three different levels, while the gauntlet also can be upgraded. An enormous amount of the fun in Onimusha is collecting souls and upgrading the various weapons.   And in an interesting decision that has Onimusha shifting from into the action genre, the game delivers fewer puzzles than any Resident Evil game ever. The puzzles that do exist are not entirely stunning, but they are nonetheless fun. If you have ever played the funny little travel puzzles, in which you spell out different words, or piece together an image with little squares that shift up, down, left or right in a confined slate, the puzzles in Onimusha won't be new. Of course, the classic collection of items brings another level of fun into the game, with things that either open up new areas, or open up mini games at the end.   Lastly, Onimusha can be beaten in less than 10 hours the first time through. Realistically, it can be beaten in about five, if you're really good, but I always take my time in my initial game. It's by no means a long game, and it is definitely weakened by its rather short game time. The mini-games do in fact lengthen in up a bit, and I was easily tempted to troll through it again. But the fact remains, Onimusha is shorter than most Resident Evil games, and I wanted more. Hell, I always want more, but if the game is long enough, there will be less bitching. Onimusha deserves a little bitching.   Graphics One of the greatest CG sequences I have ever seen resides in the first few minutes of Onimusha. Everything about it is perfectly, scrupulously handled, and it sets up a quick introductory story about Onimusha perfectly. Capcom spared no expense in making the movie as stunning as it is, by farming in out to an outside company, and by motion capturing the moves of the characters with live people. Sequences such as Nobunaga's death fall, to Samanosuke's facial movements were motion-captured with painstaking attention to detail, and the game's CG characters as well as the in-game characters show it.   Most of Onimusha's story is told through in-game cutscenes, which use the game's engine to generate them. The characters are wonderfully detailed in every aspect, from the archaic clothing and armor they wear to the life-like facial expressions, eye movement, and facial structure. While I admire them all because of their smooth animation and clean movement, I have to say, my only complaint is that I couldn't skip through the in-game cut-scenes. With a relatively short game such as Onimusha, I played through the game twice, and seeing the cut-scenes without being able to skip them was a drag.   If you want to see true next-generation special effects, however, Onimusha has them in spades. The game utilizes dozens of PS2 effects from volumetric fog to blurring effects, to excellent transparencies and tons of clever lighting effects. In one room, a patch of fog slowly swirls around, and just looks real, not like a sprite, nor a polygon. New effects are used elegantly, too. One sub-boss's special effect is invisibility. Players only see his figure's silhouette represented by a chrome-like blurring of his image. It's simply beautiful to see.   Other effects such as fire and smoke are also stunning, as are the particles shown in sword fights and clanging weapons. But perhaps the coolest effect of them all, which is almost hidden, is the West Area's water. Never has water been so realistically represented in a game (although Wave Race 64 comes damn close). Here, a quiet, gently lapping set of waves wash up onto the lake's shore just like in real life. The layers of randomly generated waves that cross each other in mid-lake are truly mesmerizing.   Although normally I would place the bosses and enemies in the game play section, these creatures deserve special attention. The creatures and enemy design here is superb. Every creature is imaginatively formed, from the first troll boss, to the squiggly, goopy worm bosses, to Marcellus, the Minotaurs, the blue, floating soul suckers, the wasp-lady and the last boss, Fortinbras. (Oh, and you'll definitely become accustomed to hearing this one phrase, ~I am Fortinbras!~-- trust me.)   A special note about Capcom's port to the US: For American gamers who don't get to play the Japanese version of Onimusha, you miss a pretty sexy/nasty transformation scene that was totally hacked in the American version. The scene shows her laying down, spreading her legs and then transforming, quite sexually, into a giant flying wasp. The scene in the US version pretty much cuts out everything. I don't get it though. Onimusha is already rated M, and that scene shouldn't push it into AO territory, so what happened was that the scene was just butchered. Bad Capcom!   Sound For a game that takes place in 16th Century Japan, you would naturally expect to hear ancient Japanese music. Surprisingly, Capcom somehow avoided Rob Zombie, Weezer, and every other over-used alternative band in the industry, and was able to acquire the many hands of the New Japan Philharmonic. The 200-piece orchestra creates a score so convincing that moods are created and carried by the music alone. The New Japan Philharmonic is led by internationally acclaimed composer Samuragouchi, who has incorporated archaic old Japanese instruments (the Ohdaiko, Hichiriki, and Biwa, for instance) to create bizarre sounds, plus natural sounds such as wind, water, creaking wood and things of that nature.   The voice acting is not bad, but it's not good either. Given that 16th century Japanese weren't using filthy language and were indeed quite sincere and restrained in many aspects of their lives, the use of language and tonality of the English voice actors in Onimusha is good. Purists can choose to use the Japanese language option instead, accompanied by the English text, and perhaps in some cases, this is the best approach. It's not that the voice acting is bad (well, it's not horrible, it borders on intolerable), but while you can tell that the lips of the characters weren't synched up well at all with the English voice-overs, there seems to be less said -- i.e. less intellectual and emotional information, in the English version than in the Japanese version. And while the sound production of the game is right on target in so many ways, the level of volume in the characters' voices is often too low to hear adequately. It's like the production mixing wasn't quite right. While I have been relatively critical of Onimusha, I have been frothing at the mouth to play the game for months, and now that I have played it twice through, I am truly impressed on a number of levels. Onimusha is a very good game that controls nicely and has some of the coolest looking effects in any PS2 game to date. The gameplay is some of Capcom's finest yet, and the story, while a little weak in the end, keeps players riveted throughout. I especially liked the upgrade-able weapons systems, and the way in which different swords worked on varying monsters with stronger or weaker degrees. These things you figure out as you play along, but every time you fight a new monster, the thrill of hacking it to mincemeat is every bit real. And despite the prerendered backgrounds, the graphics are truly awesome. The score is also near brilliance. I highly recommend Onimusha and I believe its one of the best games on the system. If you are in any way slightly interested in Resident Evil style games or action games, Onimusha is a must-have title.", "date": "Mar 15, 2001"}
