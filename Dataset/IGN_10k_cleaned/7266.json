The game takes place in the land of Forsena, a region that was until recently wracked by years of war. Thankfully, an Admiral Zemeckis was able to deliver a victory and remove the threat of invasion for once and for all  much to the King of Almekia's appreciation. On the other hand, having done this, Zemeckis became bored and decided there was nothing else for it but to betray the King, capture his lands, and use them as a base to conquer the continent.   You play one of the Knights of the Rune, still loyal to the King of your selected country. Your mission, of course, is to bring peace back to the continent of Forsena by fighting battle after battle after battle after battle.  Brigandine's storyline is presented through text boxes that appear over the overhead country map, and unfortunately do very little to bring you into the story. For a counterpoint, Final Fantasy Tactics used actual terrain and battle icons in their depiction of story events; Brigandine never shows anything more than a snapshot of the character speaking and some rather badly-written (and worse translated) text.   Graphically, Brigandine isn't anything to write home about. You maneuver units over a 2D, tipped-back scrolling map until a battle occurs. At that point you're moved to a yet another 2D map representing a strategic view of the battle at hand that depicts your individual units' locations and readiness. The units themselves are rather cutesy 2D bitmaps, and all in all, not that appealing.  An option to select combat occurs when you move a unit to close proximity of an enemy unit. Once there, you can select the type of attack and exactly what it is you wish to attack. When the actual battle takes place the view changes to the only 3D view in the entire game  a Final Fantasy VII-like combat view that shows the two polygonal contestants attacking one another. This section is also graphically weak, with simple models, flat terrain, and almost no background scenery. Imagine what an early prototype of FFVII might have looked like, and you'll get the idea.  Graphical weakness aside, the most frustrating thing about Brigandine is the pacing. Everything takes a great deal of time, from moving individual units, to combat, to setting up battle formations, to reading through storypoints, etc. Imagine the combat scene above, but this time imagine a battlefield with 30 or more units on it, each one being moved individually, attacking individually (with the associated 3D battle view), and defending individually. Now imagine removing the one or two units destroyed in battle and starting all over again for the next turn. Paint dries faster, folks.  Music and sound effects are adequate, but certainly do nothing to salvage a painfully slow game. The introductory cinematic is also rather poor, and is rather prescient of the actual in-game graphics. In short, there's little here to recommend unless you're a masochist trying to punish yourself for playing through past games too quickly. If you're looking for a phased, tactical, fantasy combat game, check out Final Fantasy Tactics and avoid Brigandine if you can help it.  Andr Vrignaud", "date": "Mar 5, 1999"}
