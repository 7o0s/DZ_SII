The proper use of great sound effect, brain-scratching puzzles, and the horrors from the mind of H.P. Lovecraft combined together to deliver a truly frightening video game experience.  While Resident Evil deserves quite a bit of respect for delivering a pretty darn scary experience and introducing the mainstream gamer to the world of video game fear, it was a very different feeling in Alone In The Dark; you never had to block windows and doors to prevent monsters from getting you, you never wondered whether the incantations you were uttering in AITD were good or bad, and you sure as hell didn't to use frying pans to fend off dark creatures in RE.  For that matter, there's always a ~safe~ room in Resident Evil, but that wasn't the case in Alone In The Dark.  I'm of the opinion that as the sequels to Alone In The Dark came out, they became less and less scary. Resident Evil took the feeling of horror but made lots of changes that gave a new generation of gamers a new look to horror genre.  In exchange for a rather eerie and mystical world of horrors where incantations and bloody rituals took place, we received a science fictional revival of the dead with gory images and bloody violence.  In the place of head numbing puzzles that required almost too much thought, RE delivered simple ~scavenger hunting~ puzzles that were meant as a pause between the zombie-head blowing action sequences.  Of course, there's nothing bad about this new look as I'm sure we've all enjoyed this fresh and action-packed look to the survival horror genre.  Unfortunately, rather than relying on what made it so cool and different in the past, the newest chapter in Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare takes all the current trends of the survival horror genre.  The results?  Well, if you're a fan of Resident Evil you'll probably like this new fresh look.  But if you've been a follower of the Alone In The Dark series, you'll be very disappointed that it's essentially a clone of RE.The newest chapter of AITD accelerates the time line to a more modern day theme and from the onset of the game, you can play either the busty Aline Cedrac or the old-school Edward Carnby in new-school ~Matrix~ gear.  The story follows our two characters trip to Shadow Island - yes, they couldn't think of a more  clichd name of an island - to find three mystical tablets and find out why Charles Fiske, Edward's best friend, died off the coast of the island.  When flying to the island, their plane is attacked by some mysterious force where Aline and Edward must parachute down separately on the island.  Woah, this sounds pretty familiar.  Oh yeah, remember the diverging storylines in Resident Evil 2?  If this is beginning to sound pretty unoriginal, well, that's because it is.  Thankfully, AITD:The New Nightmare goes back to the original roots of the game, a relief for fans that suffered through the Western antics of the third chapter.The overall visuals are pretty impressive.  There are some great looking backgrounds and the game is super sharp, especially when playing on a monitor.  Of course, there are some noticeable dull areas that you'll see in these pre-rendered backgrounds but for the most part the artwork for the backgrounds is quite pretty.  One of the new play mechanics is the use of the flashlight and while it's similar to Silent Hill's, it's done quite a bit better.  When you turn the flashlight on, you have complete control of where you shine the light by moving the Analog pad.  Yes, you can move (using the D-pad) and shine the light in whatever direction as you're walking.  This really helps in not only finding specific items in this very dark game, but the light is also used as a weapon.  As you progress through the game, you'll encounter evil beings of the dark.  While you can waste away precious ammo to kill these beasts, you also have the option of shining your light on these animals to drive them away; being creatures of the dark, they are repulsed by the light of the flashlight.  This feature is probably the shining light (pun intended) in an otherwise uninspired survival horror game that basically gives up the roots of the series.Beyond the similar theme and the main protagonist, the game doesn't stay true to the series when it comes to the gameplay.  It's not that the game controls badly, though I felt that there was too much of a pause when you want to start walking backwards.  But fans won'tt be worrying too much about this and will probably abhor the fact that there is no longer any melee combat.  One of the cooler things in the Alone In The Dark series was the ability to take on baddies with an assortment of punches, kick, or anything handy to beat the snot out of enemies... or at least try to.  Whether it was to make room for the new lighting mechanic or not, there's no hand-to-hand combat in Alone In The Dark.  Although gamers to the series probably won't care, those that have remained true to this series will most definitely be disappointed; it certainly takes out the rush and anxiety of the game knowing you have only two options - shoot or run.  Another disappointment is the puzzles and while you still get to explore some interesting areas, puzzles are all based on exploring a certain area, finding the right item and using that item in the right place.  There are some interesting puzzles involving the flashlight, but for the most part, puzzles are both a bit too easy.  As far as enemies are concerned, they're not too hard IF you can hit them.  Enemies move quite quickly and since you play in the same perspective as almost every survival horror game, there comes problems in dealing with enemies.  The fact that the game is REALLY dark doesn't help and it got pretty annoying to get stuck in a spot without the ability to see what was happening.  Add to the fact that enemies aren't very scary at all and rather than being horrified at what you're encountering, you're dreading another boring encounter where you have to ~shine~ that flashlight to get away.If that weren't enough to get you down on the game, there's an awful saving system.  With a nod to the Ink Ribbon of Resident Evil, once you grab a few Charms of Saving, you can save anywhere at anytime.  However, should you save and restart your game, all your previous actions you've completed will be undone... that's right, you'll have to redo them again.  Despite that saving problem, it's still a pretty decent survival horror game for those that grew up on Resident Evil - you'll definitely enjoy the setting and nice visuals this game has to offer.  But if you grew up on this series and were hoping for the next great chapter, you'll be left alone in the dark.--Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Oct 8, 2001"}
