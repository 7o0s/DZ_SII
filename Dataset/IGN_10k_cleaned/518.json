This series is what the development team is known for, and it seems logical that Nintendo would want them to put out a basketball title for its handheld system. Unfortunately, NBA 3 on 3 Featuring Kobe Bryant isn't as quality a product as the console game that inspired it. Features 3 on 3 action Create 6 players NBA teams and players Link cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  There are a ton of features in the game, including an extremely detailed character creation mode where you can build a player almost entirely from scratch, and then trade him onto any team in the league. The options menu lets you tweak almost every rule in the game, from the backcourt violation to the shotclock to how many points are allowed per game. You can play a full, battery-backed season or simply get into a pick-up game. Customization is definitely a focus here. The game follows as much of the game of basketball as possible, other than the fact that it's only got three players on the court per team at one time.  The one thing that sticks out about NBA 3 on 3 is the graphics  they're not very good. The game utilizes the familiar, NBA Live-style isometric viewing angle, but the detail is lost on the screen  it's extremely difficult to tell how far off the far-end basket is compared to the court, since it blends in with the background. And even though there are only six players on the court (hence the 3-on-3 title), the system has a hard time displaying them  when they group together, they flicker and disappear for a split-second. I have to wonder what the game could have looked like if it was designed specifically for the Game Boy Color instead of being backward compatible. Even the little things are missing  the basket doesn't ~swish~ when the ball goes through. The only way you're going to know the ball went in is when you hear the small fanfare and the ball come to a dead standstill for three seconds. The game zooms in for some close-up shots, like layups, alley-oops, and dunks in canned animated sequences, but even these are distracting since the defense can't do anything during these cutscenes  the ball's going to go in.  The controls are odd at first  right off the bat you have to put up with the joypad being skewed at a 45 degree angle. Luckily you can switch the controls so that up is up and down is down, making the game feel a lot more natural. Even so, moving your characters is a stiff task, since you have to put up with your players automatically slowing down to guard on defense, even if they're behind the man they're covering. It's slightly clumsy, but once you play a few rounds you'll understand why the controls are the way they are.  NBA 3 on 3 could have gotten away with being a cool arcade, Jam-style game since it's only three-on-three and not the full five man teams. Instead, Left Field went with a more simulation take on the sport. There's nothing really terrible here other than the stiff controls and bland, inadequate graphics. Konami's In the Zone title released in the summer is the better choice if you're looking for a little roundball action on the Game Boy Color.", "date": "Dec 10, 1999"}
