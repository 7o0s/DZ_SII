Now coming your way courtesy of ASC, Mass Destruction is a tough tank game with enough fun and firepower in it to keep action fans happy.  Like Sony's Steel Reign, Mass Destruction puts players behind the controls of a one-man tank. Unlike Steel Reign, though, Destruction has an almost subliminally playful atmosphere to it, and it's this touch of whimsy that makes it so engaging. The top-down viewpoint makes everything seem toy-like, with tiny tanks to shoot at and miniature infantry men to run over. OK, so it may not seem playful to some, but I found it an L-A-F riot!  Mass Destruction does owe a huge debt to Electronic Arts' Strike series as far as gameplay goes. The missions are fairly basic in premise (take out communications radars, eliminate barracks, etc.) but the execution is far from basic. The environments are fairly huge, and the objectives will often be on either sides of the map (which, like in EA's Strike games, is accessible at any time during gameplay). However, the tank aspect does set Destruction apart from the Strike games somewhat -- being land-based, you have to maneuver around large bodies of water and impenetrable fences.  The real joy of this game, though, lies in the fact that everything is destructible. And when I say everything, I mean everything. Blow up large buildings, trees, houses, whatever. Power      ups can sometimes be found inside the      hollowed-out shells as well, which gives you more      of a purpose than just 'mass destruction.' Basic ammo is pretty much endless, so shoot all you want. The more powerful weapons, like the flame thrower and mortar, just add to the fun.  Mass Destruction isn't perfect, though. The graphics, while not terrible, could've been a little sharper. The control is a little strange to get used to as well, and the tank can occasionally stick between objects. However, these are minor quibbles.  If you're looking for a quick action fix, and enjoy the Strike games, Mass Destruction may be just the ticket.", "date": "Nov 6, 1997"}
