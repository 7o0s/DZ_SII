That's the premise behind The Legend of Jack Sparrow, an interesting retelling of the Hollywood hit that starred Johny Depp, Keira Knightly and Geoffrey Rush. That's right, Geoffrey Rush, not Orlando Bloom. The game comes from Seven Studios, makers of the semi-recent Fantastic Four and Defender, remake of the classic arcade shooter.   While the premise in Legend of Jack Sparrow certainly makes for interesting scenarios, the rest of the game fails to keep up. What could have been a perfectly decent, maybe even good, third person swashbuckler ultimately winds up feeling lifeless. Not because any particular element is terrible, but simply because much of the experience gets hampered by sloppy control and poor execution. Although at first it didn't really seem that way.   The Legend of Jack Sparrow appeared to have all the necessary elements. To start, it took a good story and threw in a bunch of funny, improbable scenarios the likes of which only Jack Sparrow could tell. Then it added co-op multiplayer in every level. You can choose between Jack Sparrow and whoever the hell Orlando Bloom played. Should you be friendless, a simple tap of the D-pad lets you switch between the two whenever you like. To make things even better, each character boasts fine voice work.  So far so good. Developers even threw in a full upgrade system, which lets you trade in gold (scattered about each stage) for stronger moves. You can't manually purchase new sword techniques, however, since you unlock them automatically the further you progress in the game. But you can make each of them stronger. Speaking of, the game does give you a decent number of moves. In addition to the basic weak and strong slashes, you eventually learn throws, counters and spin attacks. You can upgrade each multiple times per character, too, so there's plenty of room for improvement.   There's even a fair bit of interactivity in each of the game's (admittedly varied) environments. You can slash at pillars and support beams to send evil pirates tumbling to their doom. You can place explosive barrels throughout each stage to unlock secrets, too. And certain objects, like lifts and mine carts, can be manipulated in a bunch of different ways. All things considered, it's not a bad package. The Legend of Jack Sparrow has everything required of a solid action game. Where the developers failed was in the execution of almost everything mentioned above. And it's a shame, really.      A shame because the games industry needs more pirate games worthy of attention. Sadly, a lack of development time (or some other factor) sabotaged any chance of this game earning respect. Thing is, even with all the elements mentioned above, the entire affair just comes off bland. The most important aspect of the game, swordplay, feels especially underdeveloped. It's always just a matter of hack, hack and more hack.   While the game lets you block and dodge, it doesn't give you very many reasons to do so. Yes, there's a tiny bit of technique involved, mainly the timing of dodge maneuvers, but it's overly simplistic. Most pirates fall with a few slashes of your sword, and the only time you really need to invoke stronger attacks is during boss fights. These encounters happen often, so that's a good thing. Unfortunately, most don't take much effort to kill. And few of them don't require anything more than brute force.    As far as puzzles go, you will need to solve a few. None of them require more than a little patience, but it's good to have some in the game, anyway. Most simply have you pull a few levers to open a door, or place an explosive charge on a specific section of the stage. In later levels puzzles get a smidge more intricate, but it's just the same stuff from before, except longer: more levers, more doors and more explosive charges.  In addition to the lackluster gameplay, the game has a series of glaring programming flaws. For instance, when playing alone, you'll notice the AI controlled allies get stuck behind barrels and walls. When not trying to sprint through a doorway, they'll sometimes just stand about while enemies tear you to shreds. Actually, enemies don't fare much better. They too just stand around, even if you're walking right next to them. It makes the game feel cheap, like it shipped without proper quality assurance testing to capitalize on the upcoming film.   To sum up, The Legend of Jack Sparrow has all the right parts, but none of them gel together well. The swordplay never truly excites, while the puzzles and enemies never rise above mediocrity. The game looks decent for a PS2 game, but fans of the action genre will need to look elsewhere for carnage on the high seas.", "date": "Jun 28, 2006"}
