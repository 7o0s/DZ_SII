The first things revolve around some dirty business. I mean, when was the last time I had to bath my game character? There are other things. I watched in amazement as my Sim finished eating dinner and proceeded to place a dirty plate of food on the floor. On the floor! Then to my prudish astonishment, I was forced to make my Sim use a toilet and, in a separate moment, flush it. Yes, this is all very disorienting, yet it's strange and wonderful too in a meditative, Zen-like, living in the here-and-now way.    You see, much like Will Wright's Sim City series, The Sims is about building, creating, watching -- and dealing with -- the results of your actions. Only this time it's with people. Or, mostly people. Sim people.   For those folks who truly want something different on their PlayStation 2s, The Sims delivers a slow wave of unfolding and unusual pleasure, a sensation rife with surprise and delight that's unique among games today.    Gameplay  Taking the most successful PC game ever onto any other console seems like it would be an easy thing to do. But as anyone knows, nothing is easy in the videogame business, except perhaps selling 7-plus million Grand Theft Auto III games. Thankfully, Maxis stood resolute in its approach to the PS2, and gave its weird ~simulation~ title new life by improving it in several ways, adding to the graphics, basic gameplay, and to the multiplayer options, too.   The core additions shouldn't only interest PS2 gamers, but PC gamers too. First, the PS2 controller has been nearly perfectly mapped to control the game. It feels as if it were designed entirely with a PS2 gamer in mind (naturally, it was). Players can swing around in circles, zoom in and out, or do both simultaneously using the analog controls. R3 controls the camera, while L3 moves the circular target, which can also function like a camera. The Dpad has been used efficiently too. With it you can check your personality, career, relationship, and motives. Pressing start enables players to buy or build, and to save and quit. Using R1 increases your Sims' speed of motion.   The game instantly places players into the ~Get a Life~ mode, leading them into their first ~life~ using a dream sequence to illustrate the great benefits of Sim living. From that simple introduction, every action is illustrated with bubbles to explain their functions, and you get to fulfill your first set of goals. Yes, another new feature in The Sims is that in addition to free play mode, ~Get a Life~ is a mission-based mode that players can win. The first set of goals is simple: borrow money from your mom, learn to cook and learn to fix the TV. Later on you'll be asked to become a little more sophisticated, creating a web of friends, perhaps getting married, advancing in your career, moving into bigger and bigger houses and buying new items for them.    Players can monitor everything about their life from their health to their happiness, their hunger, bladder and comfort levels, among other things. Creating a happy balance of these items helps you progress (and if you were wondering, ~bladder~ is all about using the toilet at appropriate times; and if you miss your cue, the floor gets wet). Each time you reach a new level of success you'll then unlock new buyable items, such as lamps, chairs, pools, and blenders to name a few. These rewards increase various elements in your life later on.   Since each Sim is entirely different in its makeup, using these measures (comfort, hunger, etc.) as defining elements, along with interests and astrological signs, players can literally play an entirely different character and life every time they start a new game. And that's where the brilliance of The Sims lies. It's ridiculously involving, filled with prompting minutiae and unending stylization. But even more than that, it's a tranquilizing kind of fun that doesn't play down to a low level of gamer intelligence. One that becomes terribly involving and incredibly difficult to pry oneself away from.   Though logic would dictate that a massive franchise like The Sims would serve as the perfect game to bring to another system, EA's game is still avoided by many a hardcore game, such as say, myself. I mean, would a Devil May Cry and Grand Theft Auto fan love The Sims? I'll bet that any one of the fans of those two games will have a blast playing this light-hearted little ~sim.~ To my surprise, The Sims is a trip; it's a game that seems simplistic on so many levels, and yet on the other, it's a vast jungle of minutiae that link like silly Barrel o' Monkeys clinging hand in hand to one another. It's an amazing re-creation of the basics of life, from the tasks you must perform on a daily basis to the variation of AI to the absurd sophistication of control one can attain after 40 hours of play.       Lastly, the two-player games are a kick. Yes, The Sims is only a two-player, not a four-player, game, and no, it doesn't support online play (that's The Sims Online for PC). We'll simply have to wait for that to happen sometime in the future. Maxis wanted to get this right on the PS2 first and then to move on from there. The two-player games are hilarious good fun. You can vie against each other by seeing who can dance with more people in a given time, or how many other Sims you can talk to in a given time, or how much food you can eat in (by either begging or stealing it) under a time limit. This last mini-game is so absurd it's brilliant. (What a great sneaky little party game. I have to try that in real life!)   The game as a whole is solid from the beginning to the end, with only minor dilemmas to nag about. Some of the things that bothered me revolved around control. Often times my Sim would stand in front of a car that clearly wanted to leave. Or it would, like I said earlier, put food on the floor. I know these are functions built into the little Sims creatures.; and I know they're like little children that you need to take care of. These are little things that can be forgiven because they're inherent characteristics.    But there are other problems that bugged me weren't so forgivable. For instance, the symbols in the speech bubbles: they are so small that they're too difficult to decipher. In the same breath, flies circle around dirty areas in your house, and if you don't find them, you're sure to go crazy listening them. Like the speech bubbles, the flies are so small and hard to see, I spent about 10 minutes one time just scouring the house looking for them. I guess it's a simple amateur's mistake, but man! I nearly threw my PS2 out the window listening to that constant ~bzz-bzz-bzzz.~    Graphics  Another worthwhile difference between the PS2 and PC versions is that this little console game is almost entirely built with polygons instead of sprites. This brings greater clarity in objects and in general it creates a cleaner interface and better-looking houses, furniture, etc.    The Sims uses a PS2 analog controlled interface that's easy to use and explained well in both the game itself an in the manual. But honestly, no on would buy the The Sims because of its looks. It's a very crude looking game that simplifies every single graphic elements possible. In other words, graphic tarts, you must flee from this game, it's not eye candy. It's mind candy.   Sound  The Sims is the only game other than Grand Theft Auto III to use jazz to deliver its message and meaning without a hitch or a sense of fallacy. Here, it delivers a perfect feeling of happy carelessness that nails these simple little sims characters to a T.    The only other audio element worth mentioning is the strange Sim-speak. It sounds like language, functions like it, almost feels as if they're speaking real words, as if they were slightly blurred out or muzzled. But no, these are DEFINITELY NOT WORDS. These little creatures speak the most inane, jumbled, messed up gobbledygook you have ever heard. It's darn right wrong, and sadly, strangely, it's charming too, in the way the characters in Banjo and Kazooie were.When you're all done blasting the crap out of gang members or pummeling flying dead things or steathily bagging spies or taking out punk-ass mafia, you may very well want to give The Sims a try. Its a refreshing and enjoyable game that can be played for hours on end, for a simple little jaunt, or with the most nave and virgin user in the world. It's simple yet complex, well explained, and entirely unusual for the PS2. There is nothing like it on this system, and for that very reason it's worth picking up, but luckily it's an excellent game entirely worth your while on every other level. Even if it's not your cup of tea, it's worth a spin cause you can pretty much make your Sims do anything...which is in itself quite alluring.", "date": "Jan 14, 2003"}
