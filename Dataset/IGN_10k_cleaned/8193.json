{"name": "WipEout", "name_review": "WipEout Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/13/wipeout-review", "text": "One of the earliest highlights in the original PlayStation's library was WipEout, Psygnosis' futuristic racer that mixed slick and quick racing with a bevy of weapons. It was the first release in a franchise that's still kicking today, and the newest release, WipEout Pure, is one of the best games on the PSP. WipEout recently hit the PlayStation Store for download on the PSP, and though it's more than a decade old, it stands the test of time rather well.   WipEout is all about fluidity. Each of the game's vehicles hover over tracks that twist and turn from start to finish. Pickups and boost markers scatter the tracks and allow you to pick up weapons and such to take down the other racers. There's a bit of a learning curve involved with getting the control scheme in hand, but once you have it down it's a very smooth game to play.   And that's really WipEout's greatest strength. Though it's a racing game filled with weapons, it's also a rather peaceful title as you're sliding and drifting from side to side on air as you make your way to the finish line. Now, though you're always airborne, hitting the edges of the tracks is rather punishing and can almost slow you to a halt. This is where you'll need some time to come to grips with its controls, but it's quite rewarding once you do.   One thing that can be a little off-putting about the game's progression is that although the main single-player mode is called a competition, you can only continue from race to race by placing third or higher. Other racers can finish dead last and simply receive zero points for the race, but you must always come in third or better. If you fail to do so three times, it's game over. This sort of setup doesn't make much sense in that you're being tracked amongst eight other racers with accumulating competition points, but they only matter for the top two or three racers as since you must finish in the top three every race, you'll never fall below third place in the overall rankings.    As was a rather common design decision during those days, ship stats aren't presented in the game. You need to consult the manual to see how the crafts from each of the racing teams stack up, but at least in the case of PlayStation games on the PSP you're able to bring up a digital copy of the manual without quitting out of the game. Still, this is one of those rather ~small~ things that wouldn't pass in this day and age, and it does seem odd that anyone was ever allowed to get away with it.   Visually speaking, WipEout holds up reasonably well in certain aspects, but not so well in others. Strictly from an artistic standpoint, the game still looks great. The tracks flow to-and-fro like butter, and though the crafts are quite similar in design, they too look great. The game also runs really well, which certainly helps with its fluid control scheme quite a bit.   However, the PlayStation hardware (and software emulation thereof) certainly had some weaknesses, and those rear their ugly heads pretty wildly here. For starters, there's a pretty bad clipping issue with polygons right on the edge of the screen, specifically on the track right as it's passing out of view. Quite often you'll see them black out before they're past you, so it looks like the track is being punctuated with holes. As well, acting as a tradeoff for the silky framerate is the only semi-decent draw distance. As WipEout has you coasting up and down hills constantly, you'll see buildings and scenery pop into view in the not-so-distant horizon.Though there are some technical and presentation issues present, WipEout is still a really fun game to play. It's the smoothest racing series around, almost bringing you to a calm once you're in the zone. There's not really much to do aside from slodge through the competition mode unfortunately, as the PSP's emulator doesn't allow for Ad-Hoc play or anything of that sort, but it's still a fun game through and through.", "date": "Mar 13, 2007"}
