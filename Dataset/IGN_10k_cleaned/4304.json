Strategy gamers tend to like sinking themselves into the same worlds simply because they understand the specific mechanics of the gameplay and take on new challenges when interesting new features are added in on top of the original game. There have been some awesome expansion packs released in this last year, raising the bar for any comers that hope to extend the game experience to their parent titles. Strategy First didn't succeed with their first two expansion packs, but decided to give it a go for a third round with the recently released Disciples II: Rise of the Elves. It's certainly a step above their sad summertime expansions, but it still doesn't compare to the production and value that other expansions have brought to the PC this year.   There's not really a whole lot I can say about Disciples II that I haven't said before. The game itself is pretty solid as far as gameplay goes. Scenarios will hold one or more enemy factions on the map as well as some neutral monster forces. You'll have to put together parties of up to six different units, from 5 basic types of units, and pretty much conquer everything on the map until you're able to complete whatever objective it was that was set to you.    There are some issues that I've had a bit of a problem with in the past that I still have a problem with. These issues mainly concern the progression and experience system of units and heroes. The game is pretty difficult and lengthy largely in part to the high levels of the various monsters (both enemy and ~neutral~) found throughout each of the levels. It wouldn't be a problem if you could carry more of your army from level to level, but you're stuck with only one hero of your choice and 5 items to carry over from level to level. But hey, at least it creates a challenge, yes? It certainly forces you to use the large set of spells available to each side through the race spellbook and various scrolls and staffs.   If you've been following the Disciples II series of games, you'll probably have seen the previous two expansions, which pretty much sucked as far as expansion packs go. So little was added to both Disciples II: Servants of the Dark and Disciples II: Guardians of the Light, it was amazing that the price tag was still 20 dollars, even if they both included the original Disciples II (pretty much the only thing saving the whole deal). The fact that they packaged two of them at 30 dollars when combining them would have made only one average expansion pack was even worse. Thankfully, they took cue from the many complaints when creating the content for this newest expansion, Disciples II: Rise of the Elves. Not only do they have a new campaign, new quests, spells, items, and the rest of the obligatory stuff, they also have a new playable race for everybody to enjoy.     Strangely enough, this is actually the first time a new race has ever been introduced to the Disciples series as a whole (the Undead, Daemons, Empire, and Mountain Clans were all in the first game as well). Well now the Elves are dipping their hat into the ring as they follow the will of their god towards becoming a power in the world again. Their god just happens to be a bit insane thanks to being woken out of a god-coma by his loving, yet decidedly evil and undead, wife. Seeing what had happened to his lovely, he went quite insane and tried to destroy her. Anger corrupted him as well, yet he was able to pull away and remove himself from the influence of the mortal world, leaving the Elves to themselves. Rise of the Elves begins with an Oracle claiming to be receiving the word of Gallean yet again, driving the Elves to celebrate.   During Gallean's absence, the Elves started dividing amongst themselves. The Noble Elves were headed towards a more intellectual, political, and educational path while the Wild Elves went back into the forest to bathe in the leaves and dirt and get back to nature and their more violent, hunter type ways. One thing I really like about the story, counting Elf references in the other games, is the darkness of this race. Everything about them, from their style and art to their actions is decidedly less goody goody than most Elven races that you see in the various fantasy games/books/movies in the entertainment industry.   Once again, the art is fantastic, though much of it will be familiar as we've seen some of these Elves in the past, we just haven't been able to play with them. Each of the characters is still incredibly detailed and designed with artistic merit in mind. Animations and attacks are entertaining as well adding more flash and pop to the game as has always been the case. Likewise, the spell effects, both in the battles and on the overland map are done very well. As with the first two expansions, the resolution can be increased to 1280x1024, adding quite a bit of clarity and crispness to the scenario maps. The battles don't fare as well however. These bits are kept to the 800x600 regardless. They'll either be shown in a window, or can be stretched to fit the screen. Unfortunately, when you pump the resolution up and stretch the battle scenes to fit the screen, you'll get some fuziness. I would recommend just leaving the resolution at the default when playing.   As far as play balancing goes, the new units are just as finely tuned as always. Differences between each of the races are not as gigantic as they tend to be in some other strategy titles, but the differences are certainly there. Figuring out how to use each of the races effectively is part of the fun of the experience and playing around with the Elves to get a handle on their unit nuances is just as good as always.   Taking advantage of the new race is the new campaign as well as the several new single scenario levels. Each of these levels will take you quite a while to plug through, so you can once again expect to spend plenty of time in front of your computer screen and plenty of time ignoring your loved ones. The campaign scenarios tell the story through some text dialogue, which is mostly forgettable, but is good enough to help the story move along. Some scripted sequences also play a part in scenarios to let players in on the important events and add some more interest to the gameboard.   For those that are interested in expanding the hours of play even farther, Strategy First has added a scenario editor as well. The true random map generator is still missing, but those willing to put the time into it can still jump into the editor and make a ~random~ map, save it, load up the game, and play it.  Disciples II is still a good game. It isn't the deepest game as far as strategy goes, but the art style and presentation are very strong. You just don't really see games made like this very often, so the chance to sink into one is always welcome.So with that said, the new expansion does a better job than the previous two of truly adding to the gameplay experience. The new Elven faction is fun to look at and to play with. Disciples fans will certainly be excited about this first new faction addition. It may not be quite as big a production and add as much as some other expansions that have been released over the last year, but at least gamers won't feel like they've been cheated if they pick this one up at the store.", "date": "Dec 6, 2003"}
