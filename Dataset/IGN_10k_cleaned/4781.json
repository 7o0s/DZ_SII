If you haven't been here before with Star Wars Episode 1: Racer or any of the WipEout games, then get ready for a racing experience that will still feel overly familiar. Powerdrome is a budget update of an ancient game (from the 80s!) that does absolutely nothing new and doesn't do it all that well either. In the name of a cheap thrill, go ahead and pick this up. It's still better than a kick in the head and costs just a couple dollars more.   Since the racers here are constantly hovering a few feet above the track it's safe to say that this ain't exactly a simulation. But neither does it go the kart route and throw in a slew of weapons. In fact, there are no weapons at all, just turbo boosts that are earned for driving without any collisions. The principle is to go fast, avoid walls and other pesky objects, and skid around those tight turns to become a Gen-X hero. In this way the game is more about the raw skill of being able to time the turbo boosts of energy as well as weave through some tight twists that get thrown at you.    There track selection shows a decent amount of variety even if there isn't much originality in the environments. There's an icy landscape, a watery cave race, plenty of land dunes and the requisite futuristic city with the nastiest off-ramps I've ever seen. While a few of these are yawningly straightforward with lots of long straights most of them have some hairy sequences of turns that must be learned to get the fastest times out of them. Remember that the secret to ultimate success is about the racing skill.   Even as it's fun to get better at the tracks in Powerdrome there are some immediate problems that pop up. First of all, the competition in most of the game isn't all that great. Experienced racers should be able to get through three-quarters of the content with barely a replay along the way. Eventually, the game turns up the heat but in the cheapest way possible. The computer players get extra speed boosts and provide some rubber band action to the races. There's nothing like racing a perfect race, boosting along the entire track only to see the other racer still come up from behind for a photo finish. Nothing except the feeling of frustration when that racer gets unlocked and you find out that it's technically slower than the one you were using.   While most of the game requires above average driving skills and some lucky turns where the other racers get all bunched up or just fall off the side (yes, this happens) the final act changes its mind completely. Suddenly, the game becomes a fight along the entire course as if someone just switched everyone off of decaf and onto some high-octane French-pressed coffee. Instead of having the road to one's self, each turn is a fiasco as racers and smoke plumes are all over the screen. Of course, this also happens to be the time that the normally silky smooth framerate takes a serious hit and makes those split-second decisions much harder to make. Brilliant.   The usually smooth framerate is the best thing about the graphics in Powerdrome. The graphics here are solid enough without being inspiring at all. All of the characters look like some rough sketches of Star Wars extras. If you ever needed to look for proof of pop culture eating itself and choking, here it is. Not so say that it's awful, not at all, but it's as if someone had played Star Wars Episode 1: Racer and wanted to recreate it as if the players had a touch of nearsightedness.The only reason to pick up Powerdrome is that you really wanted some sci-fi racer and needed that itch scratched. It's been bugging you even though there are plenty of other games on the market and, man, you just need it. But really, even though Powerdrome rewards racing skills, it doesn't deserve the effort. Save your energy for a deeper racing title.", "date": "Jun 16, 2004"}
