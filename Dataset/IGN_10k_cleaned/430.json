Neither sport has been too well captured, but that hasn't stopped every major publisher with a desire to place the word ~extreme!~ on their box cover from trying.  EA's new addition to their vast empire of franchised sports is a classy affair when compared to the rest of the rough-and-tumble motorbike racers. They have the real AMA Pro Racing and PACE Motor Series licenses, a host of 24 real riders, and commentary by ESPN's Art Eckman and David Bailey. Unfortunately for EA, it doesn't have the graphics, lifelike play control, or level of excitement to justify the effort. Gameplay The game powering Supercross 2000 is a strange hybrid of good (but not great) physics and yet mediocre arcade control. Racing is a lot more like the real sport compared to 989 and THQ's efforts, as it accurately recreates the stop-and-go style of cornering that makes Supercross racing such a unique sport. You will need to be much more alert when riding the bumps and approaching the jumps, versus the peddle-to-the-metal throttling of the system's other motorbike games. You will have to lean forward a bit and then quickly throw your weight forwards to get the most air out of a jump.  This is just all-around a more concentrated effort to be realistic about capturing the sport. The game doesn't have the absurd 'Throttle Burst' of Supercross Circuit. It allows you to accidentally leap off the track (you have a time limit to get back on course, or you can press the reset button to be awkwardly thrown back onto the track). Tricks are difficult and don't look absurd (though they aren't too well implemented). EA even restricted the game to just Supercross racing -- you'll never get your bike out of an arena, and you may never see a straight-away in the entire game.  Control handles properly, but the play is still bad. The bikes are floaty in the surface or on the air. You will drift all over the course, when really (considering your center of balance on the machine and the style of speed racing) you should be able to steer with plenty of accuracy. You have more control over your bike while in-air over 989 and THQ's games, but Excitebike for the NES is still somehow has the most logical air control system ever put in a motorbiking game. The game supports real-time deformation of the surface, meaning that jumps should erode and ruts should develop in areas of heavy traffic, but this doesn't seem to enter anywhere in the actual game play.   The game's physics engine is just being taxed way too hard, and it shows in the simplicity of the feel of the game (although the game is still way off even when you are the only rider on the course). Your bike floats up like a balloon -- you'll get 40 feet of air out of a 20 mph jump, and you can sail from one corner of the Pontiac Silverdome to the other in a single bound. Collisions between bikes sometimes lead to nothing but a crunching sound (even in-air collisions), and even when you do stack, it doesn't seem like you ever lost control of your bike -- the game just decides that you didn't make it and runs a crash animation. Graphics Hey, look! Dirt Trax FX now on the PlayStation! Finally...   This game has some of the worst polygon graphics on the system. They are colorful, but they are so simple and boring that they give no impression of actually racing on dirt. Granted, this keeps the frame rate up for when there is a pack of riders on-screen, but what is the purpose when the game is so blocky that it detracts from the realistic feel. There are no rounded corners in the game, only triangles set at various angles. A jump is a flat sheet leading upwards; A whoop is a V; A tabletop looks like a real table.   The animation of the rider (and riders, when in the heat of the action) is quite good, besting 989 and THQ by such a wide margin it's not even worth thinking about the others. The bikers lean into banks, look as they turn, and bounce with the bumps. But the riders are so simplistically colored that they stick out from the background, and while the speed is pretty close to the real sport, the frame rate doesn't make the game ever look good. Only the PIP screen (which pops up for stunts) looks particularly clear, but it still has bad animation. I especially despise the game's two-player mode, which keeps the all the speed and ~graphic splendor~ in the split screen set up, but does so by sacrificing all of the other challenger riders. Sound This is the goofiest voice over I have ever heard. Crash a couple times while attempting a stunt and you will see what I mean -- Art Eckman still gives you a big ~No Footer!~ shout-out as you rash your body into the dirt. I really liked the cornball teamwork between Eckman and David Bailey. The first time I hear them say ~Nac Nac~, ~Who's there?~, I cried from laughter. The voice-over is so repetitious it will get under your skin, but at least it covers up all the engine noise, so I came out liking the addition a lot more than it was worth. I just wish that Bailey didn't start every match by saying that the depth of field [referring to the number of racers and their talent] should ensure the best race of the season. The game has ten Pro riders every fricken' time, Dave!  I haven't much liked any of the motorbike racers on the PlayStation (not even Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Charmichael), and while EA has wisely decided to do the sport its just by focusing just on Supercross and by giving it a TV presentation atmosphere, they didn't get it right. They didn't make a really sophisticated physics engine to truly capture the sport. They didn't nail the control enough to make this game superior over the more simplistic and mass-marketed (Supercross Circuit, Jeremy McGrath, and Ricky Charmichael) motorcross games. They just didn't put a great game in the box. For EA's attempt at motorbiking, it's not in the game.", "date": "Nov 20, 1999"}
