Yes, that's just like any man, but Action Man really loves action -- that's his middle name. Actually, 'action' is his first name, because we don't really know Action Man's real middle name... Unless his first name is Alex, like it is in the show, which would then really make him Alex ~Action~ Mann. You know, we don't know anything about Action Man. All we know is that he's an Action Man -- we don't even know what kind of 'action man' this Action Man is. What the heck is an Action Man anyway?!?!  Action Features Suit up for action with multiple action suits Wield an weapons arsenal of action Action your way through six action-packed stages Nobody out-action's Action Man Only for Game Boy Color action    You couldn't think of a more generic hero name than Action Man, and you couldn't create a more generic figure than Action Man actually is. An averagely built white guy with two stone eyes and a dappled chin, he's your action man, fighting against a ruthless force led by the vaguely named Dr. X. If you're a huge fan of this fantastically nonspecific television show -- apparently Europeans are all over this like David Hasselhoff on a John Tesh duet record -- the vague sense of action in this game may be exactly the kind of ambiguous excitement you're looking for.  For the rest of us, THQ's effort (programmed by Natsume) isn't too bad a game for hazy, pointless action-packed something-or-other. It's certainly tough, and has some nagging control issues, but those are the least of the worries when Action Man himself is such a nondescript character -- and in strange ways, that affects the gameplay.  For instance, on of the big features of Action Man is that the titular character (played by Action Man) dresses up for the action that he's facing. Going to the snow? Bring a parka. Planning to do some diving? Don't forget your wet-suit. On your way to the moon? Well then, a space suit might be appropriate attire. The bizarre thing is that none of these things is required -- outside the final Space missions, any outfit can be worn at any time. Strange enough as it is to see Action Man traverse the mysterious Aztec jungles in a SCUBA suit, swinging from vines in a bright blue aqua marine outfit, it's even more odd so see Action Man bare naked from the waist up in the snowy Andes Mountains. Maybe his ~climbing gear~ should of consisted of more than just a pair of cut-off jeans?  The manual doesn't even explain what purpose the suits are for, and for the first half or so, you're running around in goofy outfits just to make Action Man look like a boob. The game's manual is almost no help at all -- ~Be sure the uniform is the best one for the situation. For example, you wouldn't want to wear the winter camouflage in the Jungle.~ No, we wouldn't want to upset Mr. Blackwell! However, by trial and error, you do find out eventually that suits have a purpose. That's good, because the levels are structured in a way that challenge gamers to come back over and over, with multiple goals for each stage -- once through, you'll have to use the climbing gear to scale tough rocks; twice through, and players must swim for their lives.  But just because you're suited up for action, don't expect things to ever be any easier. The game is rough -- suitable for an Action Man, but perhaps a bit too much action. The control (very floaty and slow to jump) can't handle all the action easily, and the stages drag on and on. Action Man's aiming is a little rough, and some of his weapons (like the bow-and-arrow) really suck. The easy game level is sometimes a heck of a test -- not really because of challenging design, but because of grueling stages and some instant hits. The hard level is dang hard, and the more you grit your teeth and trust fate to bring you through tough challenges, the more the floaty gameplay will drop your life bar or sink Action Man into a bottomless pit against your own control.  Call me a wuss for griping about Action Man's difficulty, but this isn't Mega Man hard, where you're sweating and nearly bleeding from your eyes from tension. This is Action Man hard, where you're doing good and pinging every target, then slip down a pit and die from wonky control. But, if you're up for it, there's a lot of action here. There better be -- it's Action Man. The game is exactly the type of average game you saw in '80s NES games like Shatterhand and Power Blade, with slightly sub-par control but nothing completely unfair. And while it takes a long, long time for Action Man to be any fun (due to the fact that you start off with a weak gun and a useless bow), his later weapons get to be a gag -- pegging everything with well-lobbed grenades is the hallmark of a good action game in my book. Plus, the stages are drawn only adequately, but there's some sharp graphic effects (like the lights that dim out when you shoot out the Mine's lanterns, like in Elevator Action). There's just not so much killer action here to warrant the name Action Man.", "date": "Feb 21, 2001"}
