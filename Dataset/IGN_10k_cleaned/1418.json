{"name": "Family Feud", "name_review": "Family Feud", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/31/family-feud-2", "text": "Celebrity hosts can sink a game show or certify a lucrative place for it in the hallowed halls of syndication on their personality alone.  Where would Who Wants to Be A Millionaire be without Regis?  Or Jeopardy without Alex Trebek?  Shoot, it'd be a challenge to find viewers who'd tune in to Wheel of Fortune if Pat Sajack and Vanna White weren't MCing.  Then again, in all fairness to Hasbro's latest TV to PC conversion, Family Feud's no Wheel of Fortune, and Louie Andersen's hardly a leggy blonde.  Although not the sharpest program on the tube, this is by far one of the most graitfying to watch.  Whenever you're feeling down, happiness is just one click away in the form of Midwestern families fiending to make asses of themselves in public.  Call it the 'well at least I'm not THAT stupid' factor.  It's certainly not intelligence or a sense of humility that compels relatives to bond together in futile efforts to answer some of the most absurd questions known to man.    As the rounds go by, a series of queries is put to contestants.  They must attempt to guess the top several answers specified by a random survey of one hundred people.  By divining the most popular responses, greater point totals can be racked up.  But enter three wrong answers and you'll strike out, giving the opposing team a chance to chime in and steal the running tally.  And so it continues under Louie's watchful eye (and gap-toothed grin) until one group of yokels is declared the winner.  Which makes for a surprisingly goofy game in which players unfortunately gain insight into the inner workings of their pals' minds.  After a question's presented, a scramble for the buzzer ensues.  Contestants then take their turns typing in whatever answer comes to mind.  Luckily the title's prone to feats of recognition.  Don't plan on getting away with murder, though.  While Louie understands that the word 'job' is a synonym for 'occupation,' he can't tell 'Ferrari Testarossa' from 'automobile.'  Everything considered, the game possesses a fairly robust vocabulary.  Logic holds little weight when it comes to reading the public's mind, however.  Until this CD-ROM hit, who'd have guessed that more women interested in seeing a man again after a date would leave their panties behind than a note or message?  Would that this maxim held true in the real world.  Therefore, while it's safe to vocalize the first response that comes to mind, intuition's no measuring stick for success.  Yet this degree of unpredictability makes Family Feud fairly replayable, until you've invested enough time into the product to memorize most of the questions, that is.  Still, Hasbro's done a remarkably good job of minimizing repeat performances.  They've also managed to accurately capture the feel of the series as well.  A running laugh track sets up the cheeseball antics early on.  Louie ventures supportive comments, but never criticism, and smiles for the camera every few seconds to lend the game personality.  Flashy, animated menus and silly 3D rendered characters seem appropriately suited to the lighthearted mood.  The audience also ventures comments and the soundtrack's filled with upbeat, catchy tunes.  For a product featuring relatively little on-screen activity, this offering's a class act (or as much of a class act as a cheesy game show could ever hope to be).  Lights, camera.. entertainment?  Unbelievably, the title's good for a few laughs when no better alternative rests within immediate reach.  Despite being based on a second tier television show, Family Feud puts on the airs of a prime time contender.  Granted, the game isn't deep or humorous enough to inspire a devoted following.  Plus it also forces solo players to sit through computer turns.  But give this puppy a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised by its self-aggrandized dorkiness.  Who knows, you might even learn something about the way the world thinks.  Not that that's necessarily a positive.  -- Scott Steinberg Want to share your opinions with the world?
