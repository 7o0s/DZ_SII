{"name": "Parasite Eve II", "name_review": "Parasite Eve II", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/13/parasite-eve-ii", "text": "Based on the story background of a popular Japanese novel, the original Parasite Eve was Square's first attempt at creating what it was coining a ~cinematic RPG.~ The game combined 3D polygonal characters, with prerendered backgrounds and plenty of computer generated sequences meant to help further along the player's cinematic experience. While it received mixed reviews from the enthusiast press, the game went on to be one of the company's top selling titles in the U.S. market, making a sequel a given.   In the game's sequel, Parasite Eve II, Square is continuing the general storyline of the original, which followed the exploits of young Aya Brea, a NYPD officer, as she struggled to unravel the mystery of Eve, a young woman responsible for a string of ghastly deaths in New York City. Eve had been transformed by self-aware mitochondria and possessed the power to mutate animals into savage killing machines, cause innocent people to spontaneously combust, and just generally cause a whole lot of trouble. It turned out that Aya's own mitochondria were awakening, and while this benefited her when it came to helping resolve the incident in New York, it led to her resignation from the police department out of respect for her colleagues.   Nearly three years removed from the events that began in Christmas 1997, Ms. Brea has found a new job as a NMC (Neo-Mitochondrion Creature) Hunter with the M.I.S.T. (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Team) division of the FBI. As part of her investigations of a string of incidents involving Neo-Mitochondrion Creatures, which begin in an office building in Los Angeles, California in September 2000, she soon finds out more about these creatures, as well as some more insight to her own mitochondria situation.   The story is told through dialogue sequences with the characters and some of the best computer generated cinemas that you'll find on PlayStation. Square has a good reputation for making phenomenal CG and the company's fans won't be let down by its efforts in Parasite Eve II. The CG not only looks great, but it does a fantastic job of giving the game a truly cinematic feel. The only real complaint is that the CG and the game in general could've used some voiceovers to give it even more of a movie-like feeling.   As far as the game's plot is concerned, Square has managed to tell a very good story, which held me in suspense and kept me wanting to find out more. The translation quality isn't quite up to the grandness of the company's recent efforts in games like Vagrant Story, Chrono Cross and Legend of Mana, but it's not too bad, either. There are a few odd sounding lines, but it's definitely better than what you'll typically find in other survival horror games.   Gameplay While the game's storytelling kept me on the edge of my seat wanting more, the control and general play mechanics had a reverse effect. Using the same control style as Capcom's critically acclaimed Resident Evil series, the game is a complete chore to control and it does so many things that just shouldn't be done in a videogame.   Instead of implementing a control scheme that's used in titles such as Metal Gear Solid, Mario 64, and Soul Reaver, which has the character move in the direction that the player presses the directional pad, it uses the sluggish Resident Evil control method. This is arguably the worst way to control a character in the third person perspective and shouldn't ever be used in a game where there's any sort of action involved.   Square does deserve some props for eliminating some of the general problems that are typically a part of this control method, such as the addition of a lock-on targeting method that will have the player rotate towards a targeted enemy that's standing behind the character at a reasonable pace. It's pretty easy to change weapons and performing Parasite attacks are easily accomplished with the press of two buttons. Additionally, the game's battle system is a lot less cumbersome than what players had to endure in the game's prequel.   Still, there are plenty of problems with the game's control and design that just can't be ignored. The biggest problem with the control, aside from the general issues with controlling a character with this style that result in a lot of running into walls and getting hit by enemy attacks because there's no easy way to dodge them, relates to the slowness of reloading your weapons. While you can argue that it takes some time to reload weapons, making Parasite Eve II more life-like, it just proves to be a major pain in the rear when you're consistently getting in situations where you're being attacked by bats while in the middle of the reload animation, only to knock them off, restart the reload animation, and once again get attacked before your weapon is reloaded. You can expect to lose quite a bit of life when you're ever caught in one of these reload loops and it's hard to look yourself in the mirror after you've been killed by a swarm of bats.   The game also suffers from a lot of cheap design issues that are generally associated with this type of game. Most of the puzzles revolve around the player having to search through the level to find a key to open a door at the beginning of the level (why can't you just use your gun to blow the lock off or just kick down the door?). There's also a problem with the way monsters re-spawn and how there are sometimes several difficult monster encounters stringed together in between save points.   In what might be looked upon as a good or bad point, depending on your perspective, the game doesn't challenge you to only keep the required weapons and items in your inventory as much as in the Resident Evil games. Aya can carry quite a bit of stuff and the essential items aren't kept in the same slots as the weapons, ammo, and general items. This does take away some of the excessive need to manage your items like you do in Resident Evil, but that was really never one of that game's good points from my point of view. The greater freedom allowed in Parasite Eve II is definitely the better way to handle things.    Graphics This is beautiful game. While a lot of people like to complain about the inadequacies of prerendered 3D backgrounds and how they limit player interactivity and camera angles, there's no denying that if you want the best looking backgrounds possible on PlayStation that they have to be prerendered.   The backgrounds in Parasite Eve II are some of the most visually stunning that you'll find on the system and are extremely detailed. And while they are generally static, the level of detail is so high and there are so many ambient touches that have been added that they look and feel lifelike. The game makes use of some very good lighting effects and many of the background elements like blood on the floor or scratches on the wall help create an engrossing atmosphere for the player.   One of the biggest problems with this type of an environment is that most games that feature polygonal characters in prerendered settings, the characters stick out like a thumb and don't really fit their surroundings. This isn't the case with Parasite Eve II, as the wonderfully modeled 3D characters and enemy creatures have been textured so nicely that they blend in well with the prerendered backdrops.   As good as the 3D characters and prerendered backgrounds are, they don't even come close to the visual quality offered in the astonishing CG cut scenes. Square has always managed to put together excellent CG visuals and the company's work in Parasite Eve II is some of its best.   Sound Audio is generally considered to be one of the most important elements of a game and can help make a good game even better. And while this is true for every type of game, it probably holds more weight in the survival horror genre than in any other. This is the case because in order for a survival horror game to give the player real emotions of fear and suspense, it has to have the right music and sound effects.   Square has succeeded in this department with Parasite Eve II. The game's musical score is top notch and it does an excellent job of building the player's emotions and providing just enough suspense and feeling at the key moments of the game. What's more, the sound effects are handled quite well and everything from the footsteps that sound differently depending on the surfaces you're walking on to the ambient background noises and to the diverse monster screams and squeals, all help bring the game player into Aya Brea's world.  Reviewing this game and, more specifically, settling in on a final score for it has been an extremely difficult task. On one hand, I thoroughly enjoyed the general plot and storyline of Parasite Eve II and felt that it had a special cinematic quality that helps it stand above many of its peers. The story was filled with suspense, plenty of nice little plot twists and turns, and generally kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to find out more. On the other hand, the game's poor control and busted play mechanics blemished the gaming experience. Much like every other game in the survival horror genre, Parasite Eve II is plagued with sloppy ~Resident Evil~ style controls and annoying game design. Many of the puzzles have you going through an entire level just to set off an event that has you in turn go all the way back to the beginning of the very same level. All the while, you'll have to continuously face countless enemies that are generally more of a nuisance than a real challenge. To top off all of that, the player must rely on save points that are sometimes placed strategically after consecutive and challenging monster encounters. I often found myself wanting to play more just to further along the story, while at the same time wanting to throw my PlayStation out of pure anger and frustration. Your average person can only take so much -- and getting killed by a group of bats while trying to get to a save point after killing a very strong and challenging boss is enough to drive most rational individuals insane. In spite of the game's problems, it still managed to pull me in enough that I felt the desire and need to beat it. This doesn't make up for its flaws, but it does suggest that the game does have some things going for it. Diehard fans of the Resident Evil series and the original Parasite Eve will definitely want to check this one out.", "date": "Sep 13, 2000"}
