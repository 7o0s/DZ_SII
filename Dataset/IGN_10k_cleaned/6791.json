You may get a Battlefield-esque sense of dj vu, and the ambient soundscape strongly recalls Call of Duty, but RO preceded both and looks like it heavily inspired what's come after. What still differentiates RO from its followers is its attention to realism, detail, and organized team tactics. In practice, RO most closely resembles Counter-Strike, in my opinion, but on a BF2-sized map -- minus the crosshairs, that is. RO also models projectile movement, so you actually have to arc your long-distance shots, and there's a lot more assault rifle recoil than you're probably used to. So detailed are the physics that's it's possible for two opponents to kill each other simultaneously, in the time it takes the projectile to get from point A to point B.   As the name implies, RO also deviates by focusing on the Russians versus Nazi Germany. You won't encounter the beaches of Normandy, the hillsides of northern Italy, or the bombed-out streets of Berlin. Personally, I find this refreshing. I like the drama of the Western front as much as the next guy, but I think this is a more atmospheric change of pace. The battlefields of RO are properly gloomy and blasted and full of the sounds of rattling gunfire, cracking rifles, and booming cannons. Unlike Call of Duty, though, almost all the ambient noise is actually players fighting. You can track everything from artillery shelling on the opposite side of the field to someone reloading their Kar 98 on the other side of the hill you're lying prone on. Although the maps feel a little large for the player cap of 32, you'll often appreciate the relative safety this distance affords you, and it makes the urban maps that much more intense.     RO is based on the Unreal 2.x engine, so it doesn't have fancy bells like HDR, but Tripwire has done an excellent job with texturing, weapon models, and vehicle models. I found player animation to be kind of ~drifty,~ where it looks like the player is sliding as they walk, but that's the heaviest complaint I can level against the visuals. I was too concerned with getting my head shot off to pay much attention to fluid movement anyway.   And speaking of movement, I find this aspect to be pretty satisfying. Like in BF2, you can sprint, walk, crouch, and crawl, and you'll have to pay attention to your stamina. The average soldier is carrying a ton of miscellaneous gear, so you can't just run across the whole map. In fact, getting from point A to point B quickly yet safely is part of tactical experience. Maps vary from vehicle-oriented to combined arms to infantry-only, and each style offers its own challenges and arsenal considerations. If you opt to be a tank driver, you'll only have a sidearm. If you choose to be a rifleman, you'll have some nice gear, but you can't hop in a tank. The game also limits how many people can be a certain class, so you'll never have to deal with messloads of snipers or tanks on a given map. Where I often found BF2 frustrating because I was constantly getting run over or hit by APC weaponry, this isn't nearly the case with RO. And an infantryman's anti-tank choices are an actual threat, even to the heavily armored Panzers and Tigers.     I should also mention that weaponry behaves a little differently than you're probably used to. Aside from having no crosshairs, you will have to manually reload a rifle, although you do that simply by hitting the ~fire~ button a second time. If your rifle uses a clip instead of a magazine, you may have to wait until the clip is spent before being able to reload, which takes several seconds. Thankfully, weapons never get jammed or misfire. Grenades can also be pretty nasty, especially when friendly fire is a consideration, which it is by default. In fact, you may encounter a lot of team killing, simply because there aren't any gamey indications that the person you're aiming at is an enemy. When you get close enough, a name will pop up over their heads, with the color of the name indicating their side, but you'll rarely be able to get that close. As the Tripwire guys told me at GDC, other games of this type want you to feel like you're in a war movie, while RO is meant to make you feel like you're in a war. There are no dots on the map indicating your guys, or waypoints set by a team leader. You won't know where the tanks are, nor can you tag them for other players to briefly see. There are no health packs or medics, although you can distribute ammunition. There are no mechanics to repair your vehicle, nor areas you can drive over to for a quick reload. There's very little gameyness in RO and a whole lot of gritty crawling along the ground so you can flank over to that machine gunner and allow your team to advance to the next spawn point objective.    Vehicles also have more realistic behavior. The driver does not control any weapons, and pulling into a rapid reverse is not an option. However, you have several viewing modes accessible simply by scrolling the mouse. The more you see, though, the more exposed you are. And the tank cannon gunner has to be careful with his shots, because it takes considerable time to load another shell. You have to stay on the move once sighted, and hopefully you'll have a machine gunner along for the ride as well, to keep the anti-tank infantry off your back while you dance with the enemy tank. Although the German tanks are typically easier to spot, they take a beating, so it usually balances out.     The game also has built-in voice chat and uses its own server browser, despite being distributed through Steam. I got the retail version and also downloaded from Steam on another box, and I found both methods to be pretty painless, although downloading the client from Steam will take longer for slow connections, since the file clocks in around two gigabytes. You'll log into Steam to play, and the retail version will install Steam for you if you don't have it. The retail version also has a small Steam update once you have the game ready to go. Some folks have complained about long map load times, and they are indeed pretty long -- but not as long as BF2. Easily under a minute, and a typical multi-round match can run you ten to fifteen minutes -- perfect for a quick break. But the server will have many maps queued up, which you'll vote for at the end of every match, so it's difficult to just step away and do something else.   I also find the community to be more cooperative. People will often ask, ~Hey, do you want to drive, or do you want to gun?~ There's no mad rush for tanks and helicopters, since firing the guns takes some finesse. It's not crazy-blow-em-up action, but deliberate aiming with the WASD keys and consideration of arc and target leading. You also can't jump in and race off -- the game forces you to wait several seconds before flying into battle. Yet there's rarely a worry that some jerk of an opponent will sneak up and camp your spawn point, because the game doesn't discretely reward kills. You get points for capturing bases, not for being the uber dude killer. Since the game rewards teamwork and not individual action, there's rarely any acrimony or adversarial frustration. The guy got you because he had better tactics and was quicker to draw a bead on you, not because the game gives his class more armor or an overpowered vehicle and so forth.    You may not like Red Orchestra at all. You may find the vagaries of weapon accuracy to be aggravating. You may think the graphics aren't all that hot. You also might find the vehicles to perform more sluggishly than you'd like. But if you find BF2 to be too gamey or Call of Duty to be too melodramatic; if you just want to get in and fight in what feels like a real, battered, and bleak warzone with authentic weapon behavior, then RO might be for you. It's only $25, while BF2 still retails at twice the price. There's no stat tracking, but I personally prefer a focus on the game over individual accomplishments. Your tastes may differ -- but I recommend giving RO a try. Don't be surprised if it doesn't immediately appeal to you -- it didn't win me over right away either. Perhaps the fun is in the subtleties, or in the balance between infantry and vehicles. In BF2, you're simply at a huge disadvantage if you're on foot (unless you're playing on one of the infantry-oriented expansion maps), whereas in RO there just aren't a lot of guys driving around looking for people to run over. I think I'll continue to play RO and explore its nuances.", "date": "Apr 1, 2006"}
