The series (four books and counting) has sold over 120 million copies worldwide.  The movie had the biggest three-day weekend gross in history.  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for the GBC follows Harry's first adventure pretty closely to the book/movie with good results.   Features Combine collectible cards to create powerful new spells Features characters from the book Game version unique to Game Boy Color Battery back-up Harry Potter is a traditional RPG.  There are plenty of NPCs to talk to and a lot of random beastie battles to challenge you.  The game begins with the receipt of an acceptance letter into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  From there, you (as Harry Potter, of course) will go shopping for your school supplies, catch the train on the 9 3/4 platform, take a boat ride, and finally arrive at your new home.  The game is nicely varied.  You learn new spells as you battle creatures.  At the same time, by mixing and matching the Famous Witches and Wizards cards you collect, new spells can be created.  You'll also search for ingredients to create potions.  All this while trying to uncover the mystery of the Sorcerer's Stone and score house points for Gryffindor.  Phew.  There is a lot going on in this game, which is great. Griptonite Games could have taken the easy route and made a simple slop of a game and sold plenty of copies just by having the name Harry Potter on the box.  To their credit, KnowWonder made a deep, if sometimes frustrating, game.  The battle system is pretty standard and doesn't offer any new surprises to the RPG genre, but it works fine.  You encounter creatures in the dungeons and empty classrooms at Hogwarts.  You will usually be faced with two or three creatures (rats, snakes, trolls, haunted suits of armor, and the like) in each battle.  Your methods of attack are to cast a spell, which costs magic points, or use a combination of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to cast a more powerful spell.  The more creatures you defeat, the more experience you gain and the more powerful you become.  There are a lot of spells to learn and you have to determine which spells are effective against which creatures.  The spells you create from card combinations are more interesting and varied, but it is harder to come across the right cards to make the proper combinations.  It will take you a good six hours of play before the elements of the Sorcerer's Stone story begins to emerge.  Prior to that, you will be completing tasks for your various classes.  Hogwarts is a big school, and you could spend hours just exploring the school grounds and ignoring the story altogether.  The big school can add a lot of frustration to the game, however.  There is no map and you will be asked regularly to find classes and items.  Your only hope is that one of the NPCs you talk to can point you in the proper direction, but often they can't.  You'll start to remember the locations of some areas, but it would be so much nicer to have a map function considering how big the school is.  I searched for some rooms for a half hour before finding them.  It... makes... my brain... hurt...  Griptonite put some nice, humorous touches in the game.  When you are in Gringotts Bank, you have to search for your vault.  When you try entering a vault that is not yours (and there are quite a lot of vaults that don't belong to you), you may be told something like this: ~At least all these locked doors make you feel your own vault is safe~ or ~Who knows what could be inside this vault? Not you, for one.~  The Sorcerer's Stone features almost all of the characters from the book.  The dialogue is accurate and the game captures the mood and feel of Harry Potter.  Like most games featuring random monster battles, it gets tedious after a while.  You'll find yourself groaning as you have to put the beat-down on another monster while trying to make your way through the forest.  There are six mini-games to unlock, but the majority you will never play a second time.  The mini-games appear aimed at a very young audience, but the main game is more suited for kids over ten.    My big gripe against this game is that anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the movie might be left in the dark.  There is very little narrative connecting the dots for the uninitiated.  If you don't know what a muggle is, no one will explain it to you.  You won't know that Harry's parents were killed by one evil dude whose name no one dares speak.  Or that ~You Know Who~ gave Harry the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead.  I imagine, though, that most everyone who buys this game will have read the book, seen the movie, or both.  Still, it wouldn't have taken much to add a little background to the game. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone isn't something I would pick up off the shelf, but I think a lot of Potter fans will be pleased.  There's a lot to see and do and the game remains faithful to the book.  If you're not a fan of Potter, this isn't going to make you one.  Gamers are left to fill in the many blanks, something you can't do if you haven't read the book or watched the movie.  There are moments that will make your teeth grind, but you'll find yourself still playing, even after tugging a few hairs out.  There are certainly plenty of elements that can become addictive.  Testing your various card combinations and seeing the effects of spells is reward enough for playing this game.  Definitely worth a look at if you enjoy Harry Potter.", "date": "Nov 21, 2001"}
