I have a distinct feeling that after all the ~But it's not Wipeout!!~ whining dies down, a few curious racing fanatics will not be able to resist the potential mockery of MagForce Racing, and will find themselves in shock over the fact that this game just so happens to be one of the best racing titles on the Dreamcast to date.  But the thing is, I totally know where most gamers are coming from on this one. I popped this game in, played it for about an hour, and totally wanted to hate it. The game has some ass-ugly textures and car models, it's a painfully sloppy port in some instances, and it starts off so slow that you'd have to love racing games to work your way up to the really good stuff.  But somewhere around minute sixty-one, I came to a startling realization: this game was getting pretty damned good..  I think the first thing that got my attention was when I unlocked the Class 2 Circuit.  The game is set up like most racers, with a series of heats that get progressively more difficult, and after you place first in each of the game's opening 5 tracks, you start to get a peek at the big picture.  It is then that the game speeds up considerably, and offers you 2 new courses. The added kick in the acceleration department was enough to keep me going, but it was the extra tracks that really peaked my interest.  Holy crap.  Gang, the courses in Magforce are absolutely awesome.  When you get your first look at a track like ~Needle Rock~ you will forget even the sickest roller coasters you've been on.  These things go up, around, upside down, and underground during the race, and do so in a manner that really makes you feel like you're being thrust through a high-speed hamster maze with a fire hose.  You can practically feel the flesh peel back from you face this thing seems so fast. I sat through a heated race where I just missed first place by .27 seconds and discovered I was actually pissed.  Not in a ~Gee, this game rips you off~ kind of way, but more of a ~Wow, that was intense...I almost got 'em!~ way, and that was when I was hooked.  The good news is, things only got better from there.  Especially once you start unlocking classes. Like I mentioned earlier, the game starts off kinda slow.  It was enough to irritate me at first, but once I got to class 3, I realized that were it not for the game's slow pace at the start, there would have been no way in hell I ever would have been able to tear through the track like I was now.  Because you can stick to walls, the game makes you learn everything from turns to the incline of the track, and if you forget to remember everything, you're screwed. This game gets so fast it is almost too fast, and you really have to be able to handle your stick to survive.  It easily surpasses any racer I have played to date in terms of sheer speed, knocking even the mighty F-Zero off its post as king of the road, and when you get to the point where you unlock the 25% speed increase on Class 4, look out.  Like most racers before it, MFR has its share of problems handling this intense acceleration.  Much like Acclaim's Extreme-G series, the game just couldn't do much with the camera when you're smack dab in the middle of a wicked loop, and until you learn the tracks, some embarrassingly bad wrecks will occur as a result. This can often kill the game's mind-numbing sense of speed, and you are patient enough to remember and look out for the big turns, it may be enough to turn you away from MagForce altogether.  However, true to the game's ~sim~ nature, once you learn where turns are, you'll find you can negotiate them without missing a beat.  But more importantly, you can do so without slowing down.  And the miracle cure that makes avoiding the futuristic racer's favorite plague?  Spot on control. It takes a while to get used to, but once you figure it out, the handling in MFR is second to none in a racer of this type.  As I mentioned in the preview, the game almost features a Turok style strafing system coupled with the typical left to right control of your standard racer, and the result is quite pleasing.  Throw in the added dynamic of your sled's ~magno-kinetics,~ and you've got one of the most complex yet constantly responsive console racing control schemes to date.  It will strike you as a bit odd, stiff, and even annoying at first, but once you get the feel of your sled's interaction with the track, you'll figure out that these things may be the beneficiary of some assy design, but if these high-speed magnetic vehicles were real, they would probably control exactly like they do in the game.If you give it time, you'll learn to love the way these things move, and some of the things you will pull off will amaze you.  Like ripping around a loop until you're stuck to the roof of an upside down stretch of track that goes under a mountain. Ducking in and out of two opposing vehicles, sliding back down through a corkscrew to level yourself, you narrowly miss a host of land-mines cleverly left on a killer right turn by using your magnets to climb the wall of the turn.  Awesome. The AI in this game is absolutely rockin', and they manage to create moments like this about 6 or 7 times a race.  These guys will cut you off, block your path, run you in to walls, and ,most importantly, attack each other.  Unlike a lot of cheaper racing titles that tend to focus on the human player, MFR's AI seems to spread the weapon whuppins throughout the pack, and it really helps things seem that much more ~real~ when you watch a pair of cars get so wrapped up in wrecking each other that you can just zoom right by, only to have the winner of said confrontation track you down and try to smack you down.  Very cool.  It's almost too bad that the game's weapon system is so unbalanced from the player's standpoint, though, because to be honest, the way it is designed, there is only one weapon you'll really need to win.  The game's combat system is built around the idea of grabbing power-ups, and the more you snag, the more vicious your attacks become.  From heat-seeking missiles to trippy screen clouding Flash Mines, there are some doozies in here, but there's just one problem. The ~Turbo Ram~ is the holy grail of MFR weaponry to which all upgrade roads lead, and if you have it, you will beat the snot out of anything in front of you.  It is simultaneously a speed boost, shield, and ramming attack, and is enough to tear through half of the pack in a close race.  I found myself always saving up for it, and it was enough to carry me through without any problems, making the combat in MagForce much less prominent than it should have been.  Perhaps the ability to blow each other up or making the Turbo Ram harder to come by would have helped, but as it stands, the weapons system is just too unbalanced to be little more than a distraction, and that is kind of unfortunate.  Another letdown was the way the port itself was handled.  There's no denying this game runs pretty frickin' fast, but it can suffer from some evil hiccups in the framerate department in some areas, and it is pretty obvious this is from a blatant lack of optimization for the Dreamcast console.  I don't know if it was a Dreamcast RAM issue or what, but with the low poly counts of the vehicles and the simple architecture, I'd be tempted to say this game could have easily run smoothly on the PlayStation if the WipeOut series is any indication.  On a system like the DC, you'd think they could have scaled it back a bit if they had to, or made an effort to not draw hidden objects to make this game run at a constant 60 FPS. This was a problem with the PC version as well, so I guess this is more of an engine problem than it is a port issue, but they had plenty of time between releases to clean it up, so I can't say I feel sorry for them in that respect.  The texture art is also absolutely laughable at times as well, painfully low-res and blotchy.  I wouldn't swear by the above PlayStation comment, but I do know the game did little to take advantage of the texture memory on the DC, as things like the sky and the cars themselves looked laughable when compared to the likes of Sega GT and MSR's killer effect-happy models and environments.  Even just a little bit of light-sourcing on the vehicles would have made this a bit better, but unfortunately, some incredible tracks are almost wasted on these bland textures. There are little in the way of effects as well, and most of the ones present tend to be pretty cheap.  Luckily for VCC, MagForce ends up coming off like a B-movie in this sense due to its incredible speed and gameplay.  Yeah, the visuals are obviously on a very thin budget and from a distance look impressive, but the meat of this game is so tasty you have to take it for what it is.  In that sense, at least I know I still believe in the old idea that visuals aren't everything.    If you aren't a total graphics whore, you will certainly find a lot to like here.  I say this because there is just a sea of unlockable items in this game.  At least 4 new tracks and more vehicles than I care to count for this review are available if you have the time and skill to unlock them.  The 4-player multi-player mode runs about as well as the single-player mode, and the Multi-Arcade mode offers a lot of random wackiness to keep things lively, but there is one slight problem when it comes to replay value:  There is just too much to unlock, and the game's menu system makes it such a pain to go through the championship mode that it can get old.  You have to go back to the main menu after every race, and unlocking a new class or car can only be done one car at a time. A seasonal structure for the championship and the ability to unlock a new series of cars with each new class would have made this game so much more user-friendly.  Luckily, a VMU download or a code will likely fix this problem for most gamers, but I feel kinda weird actually recommending this sort of thing.  Unfortunately, it is really necessary to get the whole MagForce experience unless you have a whole lot of time to spend with this game.  We can't all get paid to review games, though, so I am sure many a gamer will fall way short of unlocking everything this game has to offer.    Actually, this patience-rewarding system kinda sums up MagForce Force Racing.  If you are willing to sit through the lengthy learning curve, this game certainly has its high points, but it also has some unnecessary aesthetic weaknesses that keep it from being the Dreamcast's next big thing.  If this game was a little more polished, it would easily be a must-have, but between the interface and the game's framerate issues, I can't recommend it to everyone.   Sure, a hardcore racing gamer would be stupid not to pick it up, but casual gamers will want to rent this one first.  That and buy a barf bag for the big loops.  -- Brandon Justice wonders why bad game night isn't quite as fun as bad movie night.", "date": "Jul 26, 2000"}
