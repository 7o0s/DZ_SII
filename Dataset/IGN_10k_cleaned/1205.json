Tetris is great, but it's not the end-all and be-all to its genre.  Plenty of other great puzzlers have been available for years, like Bust-A-Move, Puyo Puyo, and Qix.  That crazy Russian, Alexey Pajitnov, may be the inventive granddaddy behind everyone's favorite classic, but he's not the only one that's able to make one hell of a game.  Intelligent Cube is an excellent example of what some of the other guys can do.  Spin Jam is yet another addictive, obsessive, maddening game that'll keep you playing for a long time.   Gameplay In a way, you could compare Spin Jam to Tetris.  There are no falling misshapen blocks, but there are several  similarities.  In each level, you have several gears placed in the center of the stage;  only the middle-most gear is important.  Each stage is contained in a ~flower~.  At the end of the flower are several petals, each which has its own color.  The point to the game is to shoot bubbles into each of the petals.  In order to make a petal burst, you have to fire a bubble with a corresponding color inside.  For example, the only way to burst a green petal is to shoot a green bubble inside.   It's not as easy as all that, though.  In order to launch a bubble into a petal, you first have to fire it onto the middle gear.  Here's the confusing part:  Once you fire a bubble onto the gear, it sticks.  You have to continue firing bubbles onto the gear until you have three of the same color touching each other.  When three orange bubbles touch each other, for instance, they will begin to rumble and shake.  After several seconds, those three bubbles will burst.  When this happens, any bubbles opposite of it will launch into the air.   For any bubbles to launch, there must be some within a certain proximity of the three touching bubbles.  If you have three bubbles of the same color that are next to each other, but you have none on the opposite side, no bubbles will launch.  Are you with me?  Before the bubbles shoot, you may turn the gear left or right to aim;  this helps you get the bubbles you want in the matching petals.  It's not complicated at all when you sit down and play the game for yourself.  After five minutes, everything's a piece of cake.   A petal will not always burst if only one bubble of a corresponding color has penetrated it.  Sometimes, it takes multiple bubbles to do the trick.  If a petal has been destroyed and you fire a bubble into its empty space, the bubble will return to the gear.  In the first few stages, there are only two or three differently colored bubbles.  As the game progresses, the variety of colors grows and grows, and things become intense.  The more bubbles there are of different colors, the more petals there are of different colors.  This makes things increasingly difficult to move to the next level.   When you finally do destroy all of the petals in a stage and trek to the next one, any bubbles that were present in the previous area move with you.  Things can become very hectic if you screw up right before the level ends.  If you have a ton of bubbles surrounding your gear at the beginning of a level, you need to work fast to destroy them, or it's going to be ~Game Over~ for you.  Against your own free will, bubbles randomly come out of nowhere and attach themselves to your gear.  More often than not, this is a very bad thing.   If too many bubbles swarm the screen and really begin to pile up on each other, a warning noise resonates to let you know that the end is nigh.  Unless you perform some kind of miracle, you're about to lose.  When the stack of bubbles gets too high, the ones at the very top turn grey.  These ~poison bubbles~ will spread and spread until they reach the spindle at the center of the gear.  When this happens, it's curtains.  In order to save yourself, you have to unleash a ~Blitz~, which will effectively remove the bubbles from your gear.  To do this, you must first have a full power bar.  If you do, hold down the X button until all of the power is drained.  When it's all gone, bombs will fall and explode, popping any bubbles that are in their path.  The higher the level you're in, the more dangerous it is.  In later levels, uncommon bubbles appear to do damage.  Likewise, special bubbles also appear to help you out.  You have a bar in the upper right of your screen that tells you which bubbles come next.  In addition to the basic, colored ones, bombs appear now and then.  When launched, they will take out anything they hit, to an extent.  One of the most annoying ~bad~ bubbles that lands on your screen makes all of your petals invisible for a limited time.  This means that no matter how many you fire into the air, they will just keep coming back to the gear.  Also, later levels produce new challenges for the gamer.  Instead of remaining stationary, the petals can rotate around the flower, forcing you to move with them.   Spin Jam's modes of play are pretty basic for a puzzle game.  There's your basic arcade mode, which is one-player only.  The objective is to pop the petals in each level until you've finished Level 100.  In the arcade mode, you start the game with five credits.  Each time you lose a stage, you may use one credit to restart where you last left off.  The battle game is the two-player version.  The first person to have a poisonous bubble touch his or her spindle loses.  Each person may send the other bubbles by bursting petals;  in addition to normal bubbles, there are weapons and other mischievous things.   The story game is just like the battle mode, except you go up against computer-controlled players.  You choose one of eight characters before you play, and challenge the others one by one.  When everyone has been defeated, you take on the evil Moolamb for the title of Spin Jam Champion.  Playing these modes will unlock pictures of the characters in the gallery.  The eight basic characters you may use from the beginning are Gilly, Poppy, Wigsey, AquaLad, BabyBot, Lemon Drop, Nips, and Booger.  There are hidden characters that may be earned from the story game.   Things are fast and fun in Spin Jam.  Its addictive gameplay has kept me playing for quite a while.  It would have been nice if there were more extras and bonuses, but it's all good.   Graphics Spin Jam looks average, but good nonetheless.  There are no 3D graphics here, just pixels and computer-drawn pictures.  There's nothing overwhelming, but nothing underwhelming either.  All in all, it's cute and effective.  If I were picky, I could demand more special effects, fancy backgrounds, and polygonal objects.   Sound The music is charming and quirky and fits the overall mood of the game.  I wouldn't expect anything different from a puzzle game like this.  The sound effects are also rather typical.  The levels are filled with rumbling noises, popping noises, and other appropriate sounds.  When a rocket or bomb hits the gear, you hear an explosion.  When three bubbles of the same color touch one another, you hear a noise like boiling water.  Spin Jam's a cool game.  It's odd, but loads of fun.  I could sit and play it for hours on end and not grow bored, which is one thing I've always enjoyed about puzzle games in general.  It's easy to get caught up in them and play, play, play, play, play.  Spin Jam will keep anyone coming back, even though it's obvious that it is made for kids.  The odd, almost anime-characters just scream that this was designed with younger gamers in mind.  But who cares?  Move over, Tetris.  It's time to let some of the other games shine.", "date": "Aug 30, 2000"}
