Gameloft's new Petz goes the route of offering lots of warm fuzzies in addition to a cuddly woofer, such as a cat, hamster, and bunny. However, a little over an hour into Petz, players are unlocking a zoo's worth of animal companions, such as a turtle, frog, and pig. It is indeed a cute hook, and combined with smart structure, Petz manages to claw its way to the current top of the mobile food chain.   Petz traffics in the staples of the genre -- there is no shortage of feeding and petting -- but adds in a cool vegetable garden for gifting the various pets with special skills, such as swimming and climbing. Each day, you get one of each skill-setting veggie (lettuce, tomato, and carrot) to feed to your different animals and hone their talents for competitions. These contests play out in little mini-games.   Petz also takes a note from Rare's Viva Pinata and tasks to player with not only training and care, but also peace-keeping duties. While some of these animals get along, not all species are on speaking terms. The cat and dog, for example, can get into it, requiring you to use the floating hand cursor to send them to separate corners in your mobile pet sanctuary.   The house is another very neat thing in Petz. At the beginning of the game, it looks like a regular little house with a few rooms and a yard, but as you add more and more pets, it becomes obvious who rules the roost. Each animal gets their own special area that you can buy stuff for, such as beds and toys.   About an hour into Petz, after you've become acquainted with the basics, you realize just how much is going on in this game. Mercifully, the game includes a notebook for organizing tasks and objectives. Managing up to nine pets requires attention, but the game doesn't get overwhelming, which is something that I know bothered a few players about the aforementioned Viva Pinata. The goals are set up in nice increments, the days only take a few minutes, and sliding about town to shop and go to contests is easy. You can jump in and out of Petz quite smoothly, making it an ideal escape for those stolen moments.   The game is outrageously cute. A dog on a skateboard, a cat rolling on its back, and a hamster wheeling around the house in a little ball? Cuuuuuute. Even the turtle and lizard are adorable. The house is also well designed with a great amount of detail and exquisite use of color. The audio is also fantastic. As expected, Gameloft's production values again trump almost every other player in the mobile landscape.Petz is a wonderful virtual pet sim for mobile, offering more than just puppy love for gamers that perhaps have a penchant for kitties, frogs, and pigs. The animals are all very, very cute and cuddly. The overall pacing is also excellent, as you easily move from one goal to the next with little ribbons that signify another earned victory. I had a great time with Petz and if you're even remotely down with getting a pet sim for your handset, you will too. Highly recommended.", "date": "Oct 10, 2007"}
