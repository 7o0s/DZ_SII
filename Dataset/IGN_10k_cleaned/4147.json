Snowboarding and Surfing hit the scene months later, and earlier this  year Activision released Wakeboarding Unleashed featuring Shaun Murray for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Since the Wakeboarding Unleashed brand hadn't yet established itself on the market yet, Activision played it safe by handing over the Game Boy Advance publishing duties to long-in-cahoots partner Aspyr Media. This had nothing to do with faith in the quality of the game, because the handheld version is actually a competently-developed, smooth looking and playing action game. There's just not a whole lot of variety here...it doesn't quite keep up with what the console designers pulled off on the Xbox and PS2 versions of the game design. But even with its shortcomings, Wakeboarding Unleashed is a fun and satisfying experience on the handheld. Features More than six locations Seven professional wakeboarders Career, Single Session, Tutorial, and Balloon Burst modes Three multiplayer games Cartridge save (two slots) Wakeboarding Unleashed is an interesting and unique beast, as it tethers players behind a continuously moving motorboat, cruising a path through strategically positioned jumps and rails. The idea is to not only hit the jumps and pull off some gnarly airborne flips and turns, but it's also important to utilize the actual wake of the boat to do the same. See, the continuous motion of the boat cuts a deep swell into the water, and by turning into it the player can catch some serious air. Players earn points by linking multiple tricks together, so, like the Tony Hawk series, a huge combo can be created by leaping into a flip, grinding on a rail, jumping off said rail into a , landing in the water with a manual to keep the string going. Of course, if you bail pulling off a combo, all the points that could have been awarded are lost. There's a little strategy involved in kicking off the wake, as the wake won't be as powerful coming from the left side if the boat's running right...it may be an extreme sport, but there's a little bit of basic physics going on here.  The controls are definitely patterned after the Tony Hawk franchise, and that's what gives the game its pick up and play appeal. Pulling off tricks is as easy as it is in the skateboarder, with all the assortment of moves assigned to single and double-tapping D-pad directions with the A, B, or R buttons. The one disappointment is the fact that the developers didn't include the trick list controls...in fact, the game's manual doesn't even tell you which controller direction and button combo does which specific trick. Players will simply have to try random combinations to figure out which move is mapped to which D-pad/button tap.   And just like the Tony Hawk series, players will have a checklist to complete per each of the game's levels; some of the challenges are a simple matter of hitting the High, Pro, and Sick Scores (which isn't a simple matter when you get to the higher levels), and others require specific tasks like grinding a strategically positioned camper, or collecting the four W-A-K-E letters scattered along the path.. There's even a key that must be collected in order to make the boat travel along the second route; without collecting that key, there's no way to accomplish many of the checklist tasks, which means the additional courses and challenges won't open up. The game gets more challenging deeper in the game, but luckily players can upgrade their character stats along the way to give them better airtime, turning speed, higher jumping abilities, and better balance in grinds and manuals.  On the console, the designers went all out with the idea of wakeboarding, giving players a whole lot of geometry to grind and explore...and in some places, the rider could even let go of the cable and take off down some secret areas. Unfortunately, the Game Boy Advance doesn't really have the horsepower for all of this elaborate craziness, so the handheld developer Small Rockets cut back its design to a more basic trick-based action title. That's not to say that the graphics engine is a slouch...in fact, Small Rocket's engine for Wakeboarding Unleashed is really polished and pushes a lot of vibrant and colorful on-screen action. The texture-mapped wakeboarding character animates with fluid motion, and the boat cuts a believable, sprite-based wake in the Mode 7 water surface. Still, the levels looks significantly ~empty~ when compared to the same game on the console...so don't look for an accurate Xbox or PS2 representation on the Game Boy Advance.  The lack of variety in the GBA design is pretty obvious, but even with significantly less to do it doesn't really detract from the fun all that much. The designers at least bumped up the assortment of levels with a few additional gaming options including a balloon-busting challenge for each of the unlocked locations and courses. Players can even leap into a single system multiplayer mode to compete in three modes, including the Activision Extreme Sports favorite, HORSE. I don't think any ~extreme sports~ game will ever be as versatile as skateboarding, since other extreme sports designs have far too many limitations. The console designers worked within their limitations and created a rather impressive, extreme rendition of the extreme sport. On the Game Boy Advance, there were far more limitations that the developers had to work with, and in this case, these were technical limitations. There's enough here to keep casual folks busy, but don't expect a huge assortment of challenges in the game design. Even without the powerful system to drive elaborate level designs, though, the game at least gives off that all-important ~rush,~ especially when landing that cool and slick dozen-trick combo. Small Rockets worked with what they had, and pulled off a satisfying Extreme Sports game on the GBA.", "date": "Nov 10, 2003"}
