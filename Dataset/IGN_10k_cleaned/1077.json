{"name": "Swagman", "name_review": "Swagman", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/15/swagman", "text": "In development for over two years, Swagman tries to blend the adventure genre with the classic platformer. And while it may try real hard, it fails miserably at both.   The Swagman, a baddie from The             Terrortories, has imprisoned the             Dreamflight fairies so no one can wake up             from their nightmares. It's the Swagman's             plan to unleash his horde of minions and             take over the world, unless two eight             year-olds, Zac and Hannah, can stay awake             long enough to stop him.  You begin the game in the             twins' house, or The Real World (not to be             confused with MTV's series of the same             name). Hannah has been imprisoned by the Swagman, and must be liberated. Once set free, both Hannah and Zac can be controlled.             The action then moves to the Terrortories,             the Swagman's home base. When the twins             enter the nightmare world, they             metamorphose into Dreambeasts, and the             game takes on a more platform-based feel.  Unfortunately, the puzzles in the Real World consist mostly of finding a key to open a door. Not exactly brain-busting stuff. The platform elements in the Terrortories are also fairly pedantic.   Swagman excels only in the graphics department, with its bright colors and cute sprites. However, good graphics are never enough to save a bad game.", "date": "May 15, 1997"}
