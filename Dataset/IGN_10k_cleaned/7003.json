Employing the same rhythm and mechanics of the top-down Tokyo Drift released a few weeks ago, Tokyo Drift 3D focuses not so much on speed, but on the powersliding maneuver where you have to be -- as the movie trailer tells us -- out of control to be in control.   The game spans four zones, each with a series of heats. In the race event, you must complete the track in first place, overtaking other cars along the way. The second event is a respect race, where you must drift and slide around the track, impressing an off-screen audience and filling up a ~respect meter~ in the upper left corner. Finally, you have to take down an ~area master~ in a one-on-one race not only for first place, but the most respect. These races are not easy. Tokyo Drift 3D is a difficult game for a number of reasons -- some are features (such as the excellent track layouts), some are technical issues.   The drifting mechanic that was simplified in Tokyo Drift's 2D, top-down edition is back here -- unless you switch to manual control. The game defaults to an auto-accelerate that definitely gets you off the starting line faster, but also takes away some of the finesse to throwing your wheels around the game's many treacherous corners. Of course, knowing how finicky cell phone controls can be, there are definite difficulties for those who attempt to accelerate, brake, turn, and then re-accelerate while straightening out of a turn. It's not easy and for several minutes, you'll be clipping guard rails and buildings, which is not made any easier by some wonky collision detection.   For example, this being fairly basic 3D (think early PSone, but still pretty impressive for a cell phone), corners really have little actual curve to them. They're made up of small straight segments hooked together at slight angles. And when you are trying to scoot between a rival car and the wall, you cannot always count on what's going to stop you and what level of ~closeness~ is permissible. On one turn, I could clearly see the road between my right front bumper and a wall, but I still heard the scratchy ~clang~ of collision and my car bounced away. Yet, on another track, I was able to cut a corner tightly (and this takes considerable practice) and see the car and wall right next to each other without any complication.   Tokyo Drift 3D has two camera views: in-car and third-person. One of the problems with placing the camera behind the car without any sort of rearview mirror (which I wasn't expecting in a phone game) is that you're often surprised by the arrival of an opponent. In Tokyo Drift 3D, there is a certain amount of reverse pop-in so that when a rival does approach from the rear, their car is suddenly ~there~ and you have little to no time to react. Because the other cars are tuned with fairly aggressive AI (and that's not a complaint), you aren't afforded the opportunity to adjust your course and just get bumped without warning. The in-car view puts the camera really low to the road, which is visually exciting, but not the best view for playing the game with much degree of accuracy and success.   As mentioned. Tokyo Drift 3D approaches PSone-quality visuals, and that's really pleasing to see. The cars models are fairly basic, but you can upgrade them cosmetically with spoilers and bumpers, as well as paint it almost any hue you like. There's also a decal-maker for personalization -- very cool. The tracks feature a decent amount of detail. Textures are pretty average, but definitely what's to be expected for where we are in the 3D curve right now. The audio is disappointing, especially the crash noises which lack any substance. It sounds not entirely unlike when you blew up an opponent's tank in Combat. That's Combat for the Atari 2600.  Tokyo Drift 3D is a mixed bag. The visuals are pretty nice, with smooth frame rates and some fun customization for the cars. The track design is also strong, giving you plenty of corners to whip your ride around and practice the drift technique. And you'll need all the practice you can get, because the game is tough, both on purpose and accident. The collision-detection and rival car pop-in work against you, which is frustrating. However, when you do manage to get the action of braking, sliding into a turn, and accelerating out of it, the results are pretty satisfying both in-game (you make extra cash from linking drifts) and out of it. Personally, I enjoyed the top-down version of Tokyo Drift a lot more than the polygonal one -- it's just a much tighter game. I recommend you download the 2D game first and if you still need more Tokyo Drift, cautiously take a peek here.", "date": "Jun 15, 2006"}
