In the world of the Game Boy Advance, it means that people should look past a game's box art and name, and judge solely by the content within. But even in the case of Karnaaj Rally --  an excellent GBA racing game that offers handheld gamers a whole lot of fun -- it's hard to ignore the crappy name and awful package design. And ultimately, it's this poor attention to catchy art and title that will prevent this game from selling any significant numbers at retail. It's a darn shame, too, because Karnaaj Rally is one of the best top-down racing games since Micro Machines. Features 22 tracks 14 vehicles Ghost mode Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Internet Ranking at www.karnaaj.com Cartridge save (four slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  As far as game design is concerned, Karnaaj is a relatively cut-and-dry racer. Players race through 22 different tracks in an overhead perspective, trying to out-drive the other three cars on the track by utilizing not only skilled turning, but also the temporary turbo that can be replenished by collecting random icons scattered over the track or finishing a lap. Aggressive drivers can even stock up on rockets and mines for a little offense; it's pretty satisfying to knock a lead driver into a slight spin with a long distance missile...but keep in mind that these guys can do the exact same thing to you. Every win means more cash that can be converted into extra abilities to your car; if you want, you can even throw money to the bookies running specific bets on the race.  Karnaaj Rally doesn't start off energetically, which might turn some players off right from the get-go. Actually, that's a bit of an understatement...the first few races are very, very slow-paced. But get through the first few circuits, win a few trophies, and you'll see just how intense this racing game can get. It'll take a couple hours to really get into the real challenge of Karnaaj Rally, but it's definitely worth the effort getting there. The only real drag is, once you've earned the ability to go for the faster cars in the more advanced races, the ~slower~ cars are useless, even outside of the career mode in the single race or ghost races. The designers should have offered the ability to boost the older cars attributes so players can use them in the advanced cups, because otherwise, they'll just sit idle in the game's ~garage~ with nothing to do.  For Karnaaj Rally, GBA developer Infinite Dreams established a near perfect meld of 2D and 3D elements to create the racing game's graphic engine. The track graphics, from the dirt roads to the pavement streets to the snow-covered paths look absolutely gorgeous on the LCD screen as it is, but they're enhanced even further with the addition of polygonal objects that jut out towards the camera and move in perspective with the scrolling track. On top of that, the engine also supports several layers of scrolling to offer a stunning sense of depth for cliff-sides or pits. The engine also allows for several ~interactive~ sprites, like tires, cones, and rocks, that can be knocked around the tracks by the vehicles. Cap all this off with smoothly rotating vehicles with a nifty ~light-sourcing~ cheat  layered on top to give a metallic sheen, and you've got yourself one of the prettiest looking Game Boy Advance games on the market. It's no wonder that this team was commissioned for Infogrames' upcoming Micro Machines on the Game Boy Advance...it's just a shame that Karnaaj Rally's excellent presentation has to be marred by stupid digitized images of programmers, friends, and other distracting ~extreme~ faces representing the characters in the game.  Though the instruction manual seems to do everything to hide any mention of this feature, one of the coolest elements of Karnaaj Rally is its Ranking option where players can post their times for all the world to see on the Karnaaj website. The game records the best lap and race times for all the tracks in the game, and players can convert those times into 18-character, alphanumeric passwords that can be entered in on the site. The password records the time as well as the character and car used during that trip around the tracks. Though, this feature isn't anything new, as console sports games have been putting internet ranking to use for a while now, this is arguably the first time a developer took the time to implement it into a Game Boy Advance game. It's an excellent addition and hopefully should start a trend for other GBA developers to follow. Apart from the lame character presentation (which ultimately affects the box art direction) and poor choice of title that's just as difficult to read as it is to spell, Karnaaj Rally is an excellent racing game that's a bit slow-going at the start. Give it a few trips around the track, though, because the challenge definitely increases as time goes on. The faster the cars, the more difficult it is to complete the circuit. The game's graphics are downright gorgeous, with a super ambitious combination of 2D and 3D elements used to great effect on the Game Boy Advance system. But the lesson to be learned here: though, in the end, it's the content of the game that's important, put a little effort in attracting the consumers. It'll be a miracle if this game sells on its name alone.", "date": "Jan 15, 2003"}
