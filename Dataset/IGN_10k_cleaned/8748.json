Sure, getting all of our games for free, interviewing the creative geniuses them and seeing cool stuff months, if not years, in advance is supremely awesome, but sometimes it feels like readers just aren't listening. I'm referring specifically to big-name licensed games, which are usually as playable as a guitar without strings, yet still sell by the bucket-load. To give one of these games a bad review and then see it head straight to the top of the charts makes all gaming writers question the basis of their existence.   But then along comes a game like Call of Juarez. It's a game that most people have never heard of. It's also a great game. Games like Call of Juarez give reviewers hope. Hope that we can spread the good word about an innovative, refreshing take on a well established genre, and help its developers receive the kudos they deserve. Hope that our enthusiasm for the game will help overcome its meagre marketing budget. So if you're reading this review, please help us feel better about our jobs by passing the review on to a friend, relative or local neighbourhood bum. Even if only one other person checks out the game, you've helped to make the world a better place, safer for small babies and kittens.   It couldn't be a Western without a train robbery.    Now that I've got my rant out of the way, let's talk about the game itself. Please note that if you were unlucky enough to check out Call of Juarez when it released on the PC last year, please disregard the rough, performance-gouging game that it was back then. The move to the 360 has been a good one for this gunslinger. It's basically the same game, but its guns are shinier, its horses are faster and its spurs are sharper. It's still a little rough around the edges, but we can look past the lack of diamond-encrusted horseshoes to see that this is a game that isn't afraid to take chances.   Right from the get-go we see that Techland, the game's developer, wanted to shake the foundations of first person shooters. Instead of one key playable character, we're given two, in a very clever intertwined storyline. You start out playing as Billy, a Mexican-born farmhand who's in trouble with the law, as much for the colour of his skin as for his actions. He's a stealthy little critter, great at creeping unseen through bushes and scrambling up ledges that lesser men can't manage. At the beginning of the game Billy heads to see his parents, but finds them both with a severe case of deaditis. As he's standing over their corpses, his uncle arrives, a hard, sonofabitch preacher called Ray. Ray is the second playable character. Unlike the highly nimble but not so bullet-proof Billy, Reverend Ray is a hardened gunslinger who is about to rediscover his six-shooting ways. While Billy's levels often have a high amount of stealth and platforming action, Ray's levels are all about shooting as many people in the face as possible, a task he's ably armed to handle.    Horseback riding is fun. It's even more fun with guns.  Fearing he'll be blamed for his parent's death, Billy flees the scene with Ray in hot pursuit, and the game plays out as one long chase scene. One level you'll play as Billy, trying to escape the wraith of Ray, the next you'll be covering the same ground but via a different route as Ray, chasing Billy. It's a brilliant idea, and one that helps keep each level remain fresh. While Billy's levels occasionally err on the side of tedious platforming and stealth action, Ray's are always a blast to play through - literally. He's a one man soul-harvester.    Gunplay is obviously a huge part of the game, and there are plenty of different ways to fill the other guy full of lead. Billy has access to a cool slow-mo bow and arrow attack, great for creating new airways in the other guy's head, along with a satisfying geyser of blood. Both characters can dual-wield pistols, using the left and right triggers to fire each - due to the archaic nature of these revolvers, they take longer to reload than today's clip-fed beauties, so timing is critical. They'll also wear out over time, and gathering new weapons from fallen enemies becomes a key part of the game.     The reverend has the coolest ability in his quickdraw mode. Holster both guns before hitting fire, and the game slows down as both reticules automatically slide across the screen - simply squeeze the trigger as they pass over enemies. When used properly you'll be able to clear a room full of thugs in a scene that feels part Matrix, part Sundance Kid. He can also holster one gun and go into quick firing mode, blasting out all six bullets in the blink of an eye. In a move that is bound to upset the Church of England, he can even whip out a bible in one hand - spout off a few lines from revelations, causing them to pause in their tracks - then blow them away with the revolver in his other hand.    No, there isn't a bucking bronco mini-game. Dammit.  You'll rely on all of these methods throughout the game, as there's not one way that is superior to the others. It wouldn't be a western without duels, and they're included in their own enjoyable albeit tricky mini-game. Strangely they don't make an appearance online though, which would have been cool.    While the AI you're facing off against wouldn't put Einstein to shame, it does put up a tough fight. They're crack shots, and can spot or hear you from a long distance away. They don't have the best evasive moves we've ever seen, but due to the long range you're fighting at they can be tricky to hit. Unfortunately, once you've been seen they'll continue to lock on to you through foliage - an annoying trait that isn't unique to this game.   There's some great variety in the level design, from country towns to rugged mountain ranges to abandoned gold mines. Basically, if it's a staple of Westerners, there'll be a level designed to capture that feel. It's all rendered nicely with an engine that bears more than a passing similarity to Oblivion. The view stretches for miles, but the up-close detail isn't quite as breathtaking as Oblivion. On the plus side Juarez's engine has a more consistent frame rate. A stirring score is complimented by some great gunshot and ricochet effects, although the voice acting is a bit on the wooden side.   When zoomed in there's a lovely depth of field effect.  Completing the singleplayer story should only take around ten hours or so, but there's still plenty of gunslinging to be had online. While the modes aren't exactly original (CTF, Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch and Hunted), they still feel fresh thanks to the Western setting. Watching a bunch of outlaws riding off on horseback with the flag (represented as a sack of gold), with your team picking off their mounts from afar, would make John Wayne rest happy in his grave.    There's a lot of Good in Juarez, and a little Ugly (there's quite a few jaggies to be seen) so let's get to the Bad. As mentioned, it's not the most polished game we've ever played. The voice acting ranges from passable to ear-drum rupturing, and we noticed a few bugs here and there (listening to a goat bleating in an infinite loop ain't fun). Most of the combat is great, but the pathetically lame fisticuffs should have been left on the editing room floor. But the biggest issue are a few of Billy's stealth and platforming sections - sometimes they're so linear and unforgiving that it's hard not to hit the eject button in frustration. Thankfully these levels are the exception rather than the rule. Westerner shooters are few and far between, but theres a new sheriff in town in the form of Call of Juarez. Even if youre not the biggest fan of Deadwood, or havent memorised the number of shootouts in Gunfight at the OK Corral, theres a lot to like about Call of Juarez. As one of the IGN reader reviews puts it, Call of Juarez punches you in the face then pours whisky down your throat, buys you a whore and slaps your horse on the ass to giddy up. Couldnt have put it better myself.", "date": "Jul 3, 2007"}
