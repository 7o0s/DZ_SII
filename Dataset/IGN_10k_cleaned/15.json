We're not sure if developers Lightweight and Headlock intended their game to appeal to Prius owners, but we're down for some environmentally friendly fun, especially when the premise is Squirrels vs The Man. The game lacks the pretention and snobbery that comes with ~green~ but also lacks the functionality and lasting fun that should come with a game.   Eco-Creatures uses its story to teach a valuable lesson about the environment: don't eff with it or Mother Nature will kick your polluting ass. The entire plot revolves around Dorian, a talking pineapple-looking ogre, using the power of small woodland creatures to overthrow the neighboring totalitarian kingdom and stop them from polluting/developing the land. Essentially you're a pack of adorable eco-terrorists.   The design for the characters is pretty cool. There's definitely something neat about angry little rodents beating the crap out of slime monsters and mutated beasts. Even Dorian is cute in a fat, cactus-person kind of way. The writing gets a little preachy sometimes due to the overall green message, but stays pretty lighthearted and occasionally gets humorous.   Eco-Creatures has a simple 3D environment design, and some cel-shaded characters. The game has a bit of a blocky look for the levels, most noticeable in things like the unnaturally rectangular rivers and patches of grass. There's also some slowdown when a lot of enemies and creatures appear on the screen.   There are three types of fluffy killing machines. Ecolis are pink squirrels that have the ability to dance little jigs and make trees grow. Also they can kill people with their tails. Ecomon are blue raccoon/flying squirrel things. They can fly and carry stuff, making them the sort of like a furry little air force. Finally there's the Ecoby, ickle beavers that use their buck teeth to build bridges. Each creature has a specific function and the levels are built to require switching between them. At times it feels similar to Pikmin.   Dorian can make his minions do the dirty work, or kick robot butt himself. Dorian and his band of critters fight their way through 40 missions. Most of the missions have the same basic objective of having players destroy certain enemies or objects. Eco-Creatures is definitely not a hardcore RTS. The only resource to manage is Dorian's Mana bar which is used to summon animals and use magic. The only building in the game is the Mana House. If the house gets destroyed, the mission is over. The missions start off pretty basic, and somewhat slow. But about a quarter of the way through the game the areas become more complex, the bad guys get bigger and tougher, and the player will have to think on their feet.   Unfortunately, the control scheme for Eco-Creatures is rather clunky, making any sort of quick maneuvering difficult. Dorian is controlled with the D-Pad and waddles about like an overweight penguin while mayhem happens. To select his moves we had to stop walking and tap the touch screen menu system, giving the enemies ample time to totally kill us. Controlling the various eco-creatures is generally easy, assuming you want to control them in large groups. It's simple and intuitive to select all the Ecolis and send them on a squirrelly rampage. But trying to get two Ecolis out of a large group proves frustrating due to the oversensitive selection controls.   The camera is fixed on Dorian, and he can only send creatures to where he can see. There's a map on the top screen showing the whole level though. So we can clearly see that there are exactly six enemies to the left, and six to the right, but we have no way to send a wave of troops in both directions. We physically have to select a group, walk over to the bad guys, tap the area, then slowly walk back and do it again. However, once enemies begin attacking, it often sets the others one into attack mode, meaning that all hell breaks loose.   This isn't a bad game, but the control scheme ruins most of the fun. The weird thing is, there's a way to make the camera scroll out around the level and scout stuff out, but we can't set markers for the animals to go there too. Having to lead them into battle doesn't make sense when the main character is too weak to defend himself effectively. Plus, Dorian can only select creatures that are shown on screen. After sending them to attack a group of robots, they'll immediately scatter in every direction, making it nearly impossible to gather them all back up without losing a lot of time.   There is a multiplayer mode in Eco-Creatures, both locally and over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, but we can't recommend either. The premise of the game is to try and plant trees, sometimes while robot minions attack the players. It runs smoothly enough, but the gameplay is just boring. We were hoping to have epic battles between armies of squirrels and beavers, and all we got was a race to plant trees. That's lame. Like, Arbor Day lame.Eco-Creatures: Save the Forest had a lot of potential. It has the makings of a good game. It has interesting characters and premise. The design is simple, but fun. However, the clunky controls, slowdown, and useless multiplayer pollute an otherwise clean title. Saving the forest is a worthy endeavor, but gamers are better off just saving the green in their wallets.", "date": "Mar 12, 2008"}
