When everybody was crazy with multiplayer Quake II, little-known Valve turned the already burgeoning first-person shooter genre on its head with ingenious single-person gameplay, phenomenal story-telling techniques, and by delivering some of the subtlest and funniest characters in a game of its kind. Needless to say, Half-Life was, and still is, a brilliant game from head to toe.   That's one of the reasons that Sierra nearly brought Half-Life to Dreamcast, and why it carried through with Half-Life on PlayStation 2. Sierra's Half-Life for PS2 is indeed a game worth owning, not just because of its timelessly good gameplay, but because developer Gearbox (which created the add-on pack Half-Life: Opposing Forces) went out of its way to stuff more modes of play and extras than any of the PC games have ever seen. Along with the original Half-Life, Gearbox exclusively addeded Decay, a two-player cooperative mode that enables players to explore the Black Mesa Facility, as well as a two-player mode for Deathmatch fans.   Gameplay So, where to begin? What Half-Life brings to the first-person genre is remarkable, really. The levels are brilliantly designed and ingeniously envisioned. They blend all sorts of platform-style elements into the fray, incorporating intelligent explorative aspects with rock-solid enemy AI, which comes in the form of bizarre alien life forms, and government military soldiers. And on the PS2, everything from the control to the framerate to the graphics and the interface and menu system are about perfect as one can ask for.   For those of you who haven't played Half-Life on the PC, Gearbox's PS2 version brings back the original game in true form to Sony's system, at least in terms of gameplay. Players take on the role of Gordon Freeman, a government scientist employed at the Black Mesa Facility, until a standard experiment goes awry.   As part of the experiment that nearly destroys the facility, Gordon Freeman must transform from a scientist several other roles: as a soldier, he must defend himself from a strange set of alien forms, as an adventurer he must escape from the crumbling lab, and as an investigator, he must seek out the reason for the ~freak accident~ and why his own life has been put in danger. The game is told though non-player characters, scientists and guards (known affectionately as Barnies) who provide Freeman with subtle clues and messages through scripted conversations and cut-scenes.   Players control Freeman from the first-person perspective, using either the standard Dual Shock controller, or by keyboard and mouse, via the PS2's USB port. Gearbox really nailed the PS2 Dual Shock for every subtlety its worth. Players move fluidly and smoothly across every surface, almost like they're on roller skates, but yet at any time, they can stop on a dime.   Like most games, Gearbox has implemented a semi Auto-Targeting function, but it too is almost invisibly implemented. The diamond-shaped device rolls over the enemy, and inside it is a moving reticule that displays the exact spot of the target you plan to hit, enabling very specific aiming, and ensuring general damage, too. It's actually better than an Auto-Targeting function because it functions less like a crutch, and more intuitively. All of this good control is complemented with a sweet 60 frame per second framerate that keeps the action moving along crisply and without a hitch.   As you've probably already heard, Half-Life is designed with extraordinary skill and creativity. As Freeman tries to escape from the Black Mesa Research Facility, he uncovers a vast building, from the hallways and office cubes to underwater passageways, service elevators and trains to the deep innards of the building, ranging from nuclear waste pools to infested vent shafts to newly tunneled underwater chasms.   But Half-Life plays as much like a platform game in many respects as it does a traditional first-person shooter. Navigating skinny water drainpipes and jumping across harrowing elevator shaft chasms are just par for the course. What also never ceases to amaze is the truly genius level of balance between enemy combat, exploration, and subtle puzzle design. And yet, even after players ogle over the games ongoing design, Half-Life is driven by a story that's well crafted, dribbled out in little packets of significant info that compel players to progress. The game is truly unique in this respect, and for that purpose along, it's the best first-person shooter on PlayStation 2.   Just like Volition's Red Faction (which was modeled on Half-Life), Sierra's title offers a fluid, constant game experience, enabling gamers to save at any point, but also delivering lots of load times. The load times that are longest only happen at the initial level load up sequence, and they're still about 30 seconds. What's incredible, however, is how fast everything else is. Gearbox offers players a hard save to the memory card using the in-game menu, but also a handy, righteous, and gamer-friendly Quick Save option, that literally takes three seconds (it's temporarily saved to memory). It's lightning fast. And so is the Quick Load, too.   Along this same line is the speed at which sections of the game load in during play. Even the PC version of Half-Life had these sections where, along a hallway or by entering a door, the game takes a few seconds to load that news section of the level into memory. Here, the loads are literally 2-4 seconds, almost unnoticeable, and I must admit, far less obtrusive than the longer loads than in Red Faction.   Half-Life's other modes, Decay and Head-to-Head, in my opinion, are less intriguing and compelling, but are nonetheless solid extras that place this game in high standings with regard to replay value.   After playing several first-person shooters on PlayStation and PlayStation 2 with a two-player deathmatch, I continually revisit the notion that ~two-player deathmatch~ simply doesn't come near -- as in the same galaxy -- the extraordinary experience that LAN and online deathmatches provide. ~Two-player deathmatches~ are a nice idea in theory, sort of like sifting through a puzzle to pass the time away on a rainy day when the TV isn't working, but they're not the main things. Half-Life's two-player mode is fun, for what's it's worth, sorted with lots of weapons and original deathmatch environments that have been tightened up for this smaller kind of combat.   A four-person deathmatch would have been better, far better, and an online, PS2 Half-Life would have been far better, but at least the latter is still kind of a pipedream for now, while the four-player would have been more of a substantial console experience.   As for Decay, I admit I feel the same way about it as I do Head-to-Head. The two-player co-op mode is neat in its own limited way, but it's more of a distraction or a complementary cup of vegetable soup than a piping hot main dish of New York steak. I wonder how much more trouble Gearbox would have had just skipping a two-player co-op mode and a two-player deathmatch mode, and just given us a solid four-player deathmatch mode. That, I would have liked. Hey, if the guys from EA can serve up a deep, creative, and fun four-player deathmatch in Agent Under Fire, then surely the talented folks as Gearbox could do it.   However you slice up Half-Life for PS2, the game is so solid, so respectable, and still so relevant just in the main game itself (the single-player mode ~Half-life~), that players won't be disappointed one lick with this purchase. The game is easily 15-20 hours long, and adding in Decay and Head-to-Head only adds another 20 hours, minimum.   Graphics Perhaps the whole four-player deathmatch issue is answered when one looks at the level of graphic detail, high resolution graphics, and stellar texture detail that Gearbox has so artfully implemented in this PS2 version. Sure, the first PC version arrived in retail stores three years ago, but this version looks truly stunning. Every hard-core fan I have spoken with who still loves Half-Life to this day has shown genuine amazement at the highly refined textures, character models, and sweet sheen of this PS2 version.   With textures these good, and with a high framerate, it's difficult to keep a game moving at 60 fps, no doubt, and it's surely one of the areas in which Gearbox had to compromise.   Gearbox did a lot of work on these models. The game delivers four times the polygons in this Half-Life than the first did, with better-looking characters, weapons, and incredibly detailed facial expressions and body animations than ever before. The game doesn't offer the same level of facial depth and detail that's seen in EA's Agent Under Fire, but the game does its job well, nonetheless. Gearbox performed beautifully in bringing over the wide set of alien creatures unscathed, too.   As far as design goes, the game as a whole is truly gorgeous. The artists and designers share a sharp eye for detail, and for simply using things such as well-selected character fonts and shades of color, in this case orange, with the maximum amount of impact. It's a beautiful looking game in ever aspect.   Sound When it comes to the effects of sound, Valve and Gearbox are once again on par with the best developers around. The atmospheric music is minimal, while the designers have placed a premium on long bouts of silence, broken up only by monster sounds, steaming pipes, bubbling pools of toxic waste, and the remarkable simplicity of Freeman's very own footsteps. Using the idea that less is more, Valve's sounds theory proves true: each sound grows to a more meaningful, even more profound level, and players have to pay attention to more subtle sounds and become more attuned to the environments around them.   It must be said that the voice acting in Half-Life is tremendously goofy, subtle and downright hilarious. Walking up to any non-player character, gamers can press X to activate more than a handful of different responses. The scientists alone are worth playing with just to see what they say. And every one of the creature sounds is strange and wonderful.  When it comes to first-person shooters, Half-Life may indeed be yesterday's pop star, but Sierra's stunning first-person shooter hasn't aged a bit. The gameplay still represents some of the finest there is on the planet, and after 50 ~game of the year awards~ and ~best game ever~ trophies, it's quite unanimous that Half-Life is a one-of-a-kind title. On PS2, Half-Life also is one of the best-produced and best-looking games on the PlayStation 2. The menu and interface design are impeccable, and the load and save times are amazingly quick, which gamers such as myself are truly grateful for. The PS2 version, as I have said, runs at a crisp 60 fps, and looks clean, sharp, and unique in background and character design. And while I'm not a big fan of two-player deathmatches (I don't know a whole lot of folks who are), the Head-to-Head levels will entice some small group of folks, and if it's simply to just enjoy more of Half-Life's essence, then so be it. Decay, the co-op mode, is also sort of neat in its own limited way, that might engage casual gamers more than those known as the hardcore. All in all, Half-Life is the best first-person shooter on PlayStation 2 to date, tying Red Faction in score because of its rather old age (like I said, it is three years old). Gearbox has performed beautifully on every level in its delivery of the brilliant PC game; I would go as far as to say that this is the best PC port I have ever seen on a console. So yeah, if you own a PS2 and you dig first-person shooters, you should absolutely do yourself the favor and get a copy of Half-life ASAP.", "date": "Nov 17, 2001"}
