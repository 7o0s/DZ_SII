So the publisher of some of the best wireless games in the world rallies back with an updated skater, complete with all the necessary requirements of today's respectable xtreme(!) sports sims: celeb branding and licensed threads. Oh, and it is doesn't hurt that the simplistic skating engine has been totally overhauled. But is it all enough to make JAMDAT's run biff it?   Features:   Endorsed by Geoff Rawley Best Skater of 2001 (Thrasher Magazine)  2 game modes  14 levels   Skaters may recognize Skate & Slam's endorser: Geoff Rawley. He was voted Best Skater in 2001 by Thrasher Magazine, the sport's monthly bible -- and advertising blitz. Rawley may not have the name-brand recognition of Tony Hawk, but he also has none of the baggage that comes with it, either. You pick up a Tony Hawk game and you have a mental picture of what to expect. Skate & Slam is a different beast. It shares some of the main game play thrusts -- tricks and goal-oriented missions -- but the two games deserve not to be confused.   In Skate & Slam, you relive Rawley's rise through the skating ranks. At the onset, you're just a punk trying to make a name for yourself. And the best way to earn fame (and eventually fortune) in the skate universe is to pull off tricks. Blessedly, you can attempt even the craziest of maneuvers on your board in Skate & Slam without worrying about blowing out a knee or shattering ribs.   We recommend that you pay attention during the in-game tutorial because Skate & Slam's trick system is rather unforgiving. It requires serious memorization to pull off its impressive array of tricks. And since the usual way to beat a level is to reach a point total or getting photographed pulling off a specific trick in a specific place, you're going to need to practice. A lot. In fact, you may wonder what important childhood memory you're forgetting to make room for these button inputs.   The best way to really juice your score is to connect tricks into combo strings, such as grinding from rail to rail before leaping into the air and pulling off a trick (such as a ~pop shov it~) before landing. A running score count at the top of the screen will jump every time you successfully land a trick.   There are other ways to get points, too. Gameloft makes use of the VANS license by placing the clothier's logo at hard-to-reach places in the many levels. To get these usually requires you to seek out less obvious routes through the side-scrolling levels.   And then there's the photog missions. These can be a little frustrating -- and not exactly that fun kind of frustrating. You will be assigned a litany of tricks to pull off for cameramen, as well as where you perform it. And then you're off. The catch is, you have to remember the required button inputs and where to do it, or else you scratch out and must start over. Yes, you get practice runs through the level to check out the sights and gather intel on the sickest trick opportunities, but it's still pretty annoying to be almost at the end of a skate run, only to blow it because you either have bananahands or didn't tape over your nephew's first birthday to remember a button combo.   To offset this, Gameloft slows the speed of Skate & Slam. It's not as fast as Tony Hawk, which sounds bad, but considering that the sprites are bigger and the trick system is a little more intense, you're going to be grateful for the breathing room. Plus, it gives you a chance to appreciate the game's looks. Skate & Slam is one of Gameloft's more attractive titles. Each of the locations looks great, with good texture work and bright colors. And Rawley's animations flow wonderfully.   Skate & Slam opts to go with in-game sounds and digitized voice samples than a looping soundtrack. While we're all used to thrashing with punk rock by now, the trade-off works fine.  Skate & Slam is not the most accessible skateboarding game on handsets, thanks to the somewhat complex trick system and the requirement you remember a lot of button inputs to progress through the levels. However, if you are a die-hard fan of Rawley or the sport, you're probably a total mark for Skate & Slam. The game will challenge you, forcing you to retry levels in a quest for perfection. I thought the game was unnecessarily frustrating at times because of this, but I know several skate game players who live for this type of gameplay.And there is no discounting Skate & Slam's visual appeal. GL has some outrageously talented artists. So, even if you don't download the game, at least peek at the screens and see what one of the best mobile makers in the business can do.", "date": "Nov 12, 2004"}
