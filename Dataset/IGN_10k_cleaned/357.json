GTA2 is the latest opus from the superb Scottish developer DMA, probably best known for Lemmings and according to the publisher over a million downloads have been made of the GTA2 demo. Even if that's marketing hype and say 600,000 have downloaded the demo it's still a very impressive number. I mean, just because it pisses off brain dead politicians is enough to like the game. And I just don't get it.  Gameplay It's not that I object particularly to the violence involved. Anyone who doesn't get the fact that running over pedestrians is so obviously absurd, needs to get out more often  see reference to brain dead politicians above. What I found was a game so hampered by poor graphics and gameplay control that I at no time felt in command of the environment. Sure the game is fun, but I didn't feel that either the changes made to this sequel, or the problems that I outline deeper into the review make this a game to get terribly excited about. Both respectable companies, DMA and Rockstar, stuck to the formula of the first game and as a result the overall experience is relatively similar to the first.   GTA2 returns to the world of unabashed mayhem that was unleashed with Grand Theft Auto. The top down 2D world is the home of different gangs, three per level, each of who have staked out their turf. You, as a lowly gangster, raise money to move from level to level working for the different sides and playing one off against the other as appropriate.   GTA2 contains a nice introductory training mission to get the player acquainted with the downtown area. This enables the player to move from area to area learning the ways of the different gangs and what will be needed to win their respect. And respect is key in this game. A handy meter keeps track visually of the attitude of the various gangs to you throughout the game. A lack of respect means not only no jobs from the gang, but if sufficiently upset, they will start shooting on sight. This can make life difficult if you are trying to finish a mission for one of the other gangs but it takes you, as it invariably does, into another gang's territory.   GTA2's controls are essentially the same; you control the character and any car you feel like swiping or riding. For those who played the first game, you'll immediately dig right in. For those who haven't, you may find the controls a little awkward. We raised similar issues in the review of the first game, and few of them were addressed here. Example, park near a building and you can't get out from either side of the car. Similarly, the use of the X button to move forward could have been addressed, by simply using the D pad to move forward. The same simplicity of control that makes GTA2 fun, just like a double edged-sword, also hampers the overall and total control over the game. So much more control could have been added to the character and the cars, and camera angles could have been modified to solve early problems, but they weren't.   The cars themselves feel great, varying in feel (speed, brakes, grip, etc.) depending on the make. And now there are more vehicles to drive, increasing that variety and kind of thrill.   The gameplay itself is 99% the same, with a few changes to AI and the depth of cars you can control and the size of the overall area. You can play the gangs off one another and watch as they engage in turf wars, which is a great thing to do if you like to...erm, watch. But that also, at least a little, helps you get the ~job~ done, and deepens the gameplay a little.   There are some areas of concern. The first points are raised when a hard to read blue font is used for the text of the Training Mission. I found this hard to read even on a reasonable TV. Second, the colors chosen for the first three gangs that you interact with, the Yakuza, Loonies and the Zaibatsu, are blue, green and gray. The foot soldiers of the respective gangs in blue and green are reasonably identifiable but what constitutes a gray foot soldier rather than a pedestrian is hard to see. In fact, the miniature size of just about everything can be difficult to read without squinting ones eyes.   The second major area of concern is the control. Having to push a button to walk seems very strange and combined with the directional button pushes invariably leads to a staggered weaving kind of walk rather than any kind of smooth gameplay. This also impacts your driving ability and it is relatively easy to get stuck in alleyways and corners of the world. Getting wasted because of your own poor gameplay is one thing, but getting wasted because of a poor interface design is a different matter. These control issues were in the original and should have been addressed the second time around.   These two areas significantly impact the ~enjoyability~ of the game, which is a shame because the missions, or jobs as they are known, can be quite fun. While simple in concept, you are given a task by going to a phone booth controlled by one of the gangs and then accomplishing it, the missions show a lot of time and effort. Delivering drugs and taking out an informer start the process but later planting car bombs and rubbing out enemy pushers are some of the numerous different missions. At all times you have a handy arrow to show you which direction to go and here is an example of good interface design. It would have been easy to force the players to learn the city, but providing a pointer enables the player to worry about the mission objectives, not whether they took a wrong turn. Stereotypical British humor is added, with such touches as the Russian Mafia leader being called Jerkov. Subtle it isn't.   Meanwhile the police have taken a dim view to your generally anti-social behavior. They get so uptight over a few pedestrians run over and the occasional bank job! The police are also pretty aggressive swerving in front of you and even calling in SWAT team reinforcements. They can be out run, especially if you wait until they get out of the car before taking off in your own.  Graphics New and improved and still 2D about sums up the graphic situation. DMA is a British developer and a lot of British developers are brought up on the mantra of gameplay above all else. Not a bad philosophy especially compared to the French, for example, who live by the credo of ~make it pretty first.~ The problem here is when it impacts gameplay. One mission, for example, is to get a taxi and head to a certain location. But what's a Taxi in the game? There are lots of different vehicles from TV Trucks to limousines, and everything in between, but a lot of it looks the same due to the small 2D graphics. That's just one example. Another example of graphic difficulty is in the overhead buildings, especially in the industrial areas. What happens when you cross under them could end the mission, but you won't see it. Even for those with good eyes, Grand Theft Auto 2 looks almost identical to its predecessor. Needless to say, the series is well overdue for a thorough makeover and one that's far and away different from GTA2.   Sound  As usual, this is where the game excels. Each car that you steal ends up with a radio tuned to a specific station. This is a very nice device to interject different styles and mood and compliment the environment. It's also pretty entertaining as you get not only music stations but also talk radio and commercials. The music in GTA always has been a strong point, especially the music the reprise London 1969. Here, the music is a unique tool to encourage gamers to simply search out new vehicles just to see what's playing on the radio.Call me a philistine for not liking what has been bandied as the next great game but I can't in all good conscious recommend Grand Theft Auto 2. Normally when poor graphic and interface choices have been made the overall gameplay wasn't that good anyway. Here we have one of the few times that good gameplay has been badly hampered by control and graphic choices. However, especially for those of you who enjoyed the first, I do recommend it as a rental because if you can get by the control and graphic issues this is a game you may well enjoy. As for it being new a different, well, you're not in for anything exciting.", "date": "Oct 28, 1999"}
