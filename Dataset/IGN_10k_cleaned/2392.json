{"name": "Dig Dug Deeper", "name_review": "Dig Dug Deeper", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/15/dig-dug-deeper", "text": "Remember the golden days of video games? The days of mad masses storming dark arcades clad in short-shorts and knee-high socks? High scores? Initials? Ringing ears? Those were good days for video game companies -- extraordinary growth and a seemingly insatiable demand created history. One such company that happened to be in the right place at the right time with the right people was Atari. Its name taken from the Japanese strategy game Go, Atari became the fastest growing American company in US history -- leaping from millions in profits to billions in a year. Nolan Bushnell and his army of imaginative designers created title after title in their battle to dominate the electronic pop-culture that was sweeping the world. One such title was Dig Dug. And now, nineteen years after its creation, Infogrames releases another chapter in the series: Dig Dug Deeper.  According to Dig Dug Deeper everyone's favorite burrower took a vacation after his dirty exploits of 1982 (I guess the forces that be forgot about 1985's Dig Dug 2) and took off for a vacation. Where did he go you ask? Well, space of course. He packed his lunch and harpoon/hose/drill into his trusty rocket and blasted off. He was bored from having eradicated all the Pookas and Fygars the World had to offer -- wouldn't you be? Years later, the miner stumbled across an alien solar system infested with his old adversaries. His helmet dusted and boots laced, Dig Dug deorbited and set about a new battle with some familiar and new foes.  Dig Dug Deeper adds a third dimension to the series. It combines 3D graphics with a two dimensional gameplay. Planets in the solar system are broken down into worlds that the hero can walk around in. The worlds are simply crafted 3D environments that illustrate the personality of the game's varying planets. Utopian cityscapes, crusty volcanic wastelands, and barren lunar plains all host hordes of subterranean monsters. The environments are cute and have a comic feel to their design. The artwork seems drawn for children -- considering the game is rated E (Everyone) by the Electronic Software Ratings Board, you can imagine who the market target is for this game.  Digging tunnels in the game sends you to a 2D-play field similar to that used in the original. However, the tunnels are animated as 3D constructs. Tunnels change their shape according to perspective as you mole around strata strewn with boulders and air pockets. It is an interesting addition to the game, but not very impressive. The tunnels have sharp edges and remind you of a bland Cartesian network and not organic caves. They can not be dug at anything other than horizontal or vertical. You'd figure in the intervening decades, someone would have suggested a Dig Dug with a truly 3D capable engine.  The character animations are, again, cute. The hero finally has some personality, as his face is a modeled cartoon mask and not a conglomeration of a handful of white and black pixels. The monsters are handsome little fellows that bounce around the screen and transform into sprites as they phase through solid matter. The fact of the matter is, though, that the monsters really don't look all that different from their original incarnations. The nostalgic value of the animations is high.  But, when listening to the game's sound, I was sad to hear that many of my favorite sound bites were missing. Gone are the sounds of Dig Dug's hose and pump, the fire-breathing grunts of Pygars, and the fantastic soundtrack that spurred you on as you dug deeper into the earth. Instead you are faced with a bland soundtrack that momentarily reflects its roots as you complete a level and character sounds that were just plain boring. Of course, the fire-breathing sounds like a blowtorch and the harpoon pump sounds like a bicycle pump, but the game really scored when it had goofy arcade sounds. Tinkering can often foul up a finely tuned machine, and the designer's tinkering with Dig Dug's sounds really sapped the game's appeal.  New additions to the subterranean battlefield added a great deal to the game's gaming appeal. Instead of only heavy rocks that collapse as they are disturbed, Dig Dug Deeper adds exploding nuggets, poisonous gas fields, and lava chambers to the mix. You can set up tunnels to trap enemies as you release lethal gases or you can flood their lairs with liquid-hot magma. Pookas and Fygars drop special power-ups when you blow them up. Upgrades include crazy looping hoses, extreme pumping (blow up an enemy in one pump), and speed-ups. The new environmental hazards are well realized in the game and a load of fun to try and use. But, the power-ups offered by slain monsters last an extremely short amount of time and leave you scrambling to capitalize on your newfound power.   The levels can be played in any of three difficulty settings. The game is pretty difficult, when playing from beginning to end, and offers a great venue to test a player's abilities -- much like the original. But, nonetheless, it is pretty short and I felt like I wouldn't really play it for very long. But I think it is worth keeping around for a short excursion to the sandbox.  If you are looking for the game that you loved when you were younger, Dig Dug, you might want to stick to the occasional sighting of a coin-op machine at a movie theater or the use of a computer-based emulator. Dig Dug Deeper supplies very little in terms of innovation and would only leave you yearning for the sound effects of the original. But, if you've got a little one in the house and wish to get them a title that could show what you played as a youngster, this game could be for you.  What they should have done was package the original with the new, so both the fogies and kids could be pleased with the purchase.  -- Mike Murphy Want to share your opinions with the world?
