Surely graphics aren't everything when it comes to videogames, but when it comes to Madden on the console, looks definitely go a long way. We've already seen John Madden's humble football game evolve into the ultimate NFL videogame franchise on the strength of its gameplay and attention to detail. Now on the Xbox the gameplay is as solid as ever and those little details are as crisp and clear as we've ever seen them.  Features   Widescreen TV support. See the entire line of scrimmage without panning left and right before the snap. Real NFL coaches roaming the sidelines. Watch Bill Cowher erupt in real time. New Madden Cards.  All-new camera angles and replays.  New Two  Minute Drill mode makes running the offense into a minigame of its own. Build, Coach and Play the Houston Texans expansion team. Licensed by the NFL and NFL Players Association   Gameplay You've got to know your football to both appreciate Madden '02 and to enjoy success in the game. With the Coaches Corner, Practice and even the Two Minute Drill modes, Madden gives you plenty of opportunity to catch up on the unique play mechanics that have been developed over the years. Remember even though most football fans will be at least somewhat familiar with Madden, it's still debuting on a new system. It's a very smart move to account for brand new videogame consumers.  The controls in Madden '02 for the Xbox end up feeling very similar to the PS2 controls in that many of the buttons are mapped in the same way. If you're used to your primary receiver being on the X button on the Dual Shock controller, the Xbox's green A button is in pretty much the same place and functions in the same way as the primary receiver button. One issue that couldn't be avoided however was the use of the black and white buttons. EA's programmers didn't want to cut down on the number of available receivers on certain plays so they were basically forced to use the two tiny out-of-the-way buttons. For many other games these two buttons are used sparingly for infrequent functions like changing a camera angle or toggling a flashlight on and off because they're a good half inch away from the main button area. But in Madden 2002 that half inch can feel like a mile when you need to make a quick dump off pass to a receiver coming out of the backfield.  Other than the black and white buttons however, the Xbox controller works like a charm in the game. You'll notice a few changes here and there using the ~buttons~ on the analog sticks but nothing too annoying.  Using the triggers for juke moves proved to be a little easier than using the shoulder buttons of the Dual Shock controller. You get more of an analog feel because of the travel distance of the triggers. I'm not saying the move is more effective or anything, but you can time it a little better and get a better sense of speed.  Other than that Madden 2002 on the Xbox plays an excellent game of football. From the running game, to the Franchise mode, to the AI of the defensive backs, everything is on par with other current versions of the game. It's nice to see that the same bells and whistles, like the improved pass defending, that showed up in the PS2 game are showing up mere months later in the Xbox version of Madden 2002. Back in the day it would take a year for the N64 to catch up to the PSX version of Madden games.   Graphics This is where the Xbox Madden game hangs its hat, or helmet as it were. And helmet scratches are likely to be the first thing Madden fans will notice in the Xbox game. Running backs especially will pick up all kinds of little scuff marks on their helmets over the course of the game if they're constantly smashing into linebackers. QBs can get 'em too but that usually means you're putting them in danger one way or another and that's not good.  Continuing with the details theme, you'll really appreciate the effects of a hard-fought  football game when you notice the wear and tear that uniforms go through. Even on clear days, with no mud, workhorse backs like Eddie George and Stephen Davis will end up with more mud and grass stains on their uniforms than say some sucky receiver that never gets the ball. And kickers and punters? Forget about it. If it's raining or snowy you'll really see how grimy the uniforms can get.   The player models are exquisite. The textures on the uniforms are so precise that jerseys actually have a sheen to them. Even if you have NFL Sunday Ticket, you might not have noticed stuff like this. Teams that wear black jerseys for example still have a shine to them where in previous versions of Madden, black was just black with no depth.  Likewise the player faces look like they're actually made from flesh and bone instead of flesh colored paint. You don't quite get the sun or stadium lights casting shadows on a guy's face, but the built-in shadowing around the nose and eyes is very effective nonetheless. More natural facial animations mean the players don't look so spaced out and high. And when something bad does happen the scowl creeps onto the face more naturally with more frames of animation rather than an instant switch from ~happily intoxicated~ to ~really pissed off.~   But there were some shortcuts taken in this game as well. The sideline animations where you get to see some remarkably modeled coaches and players reacting to the game look suspiciously identical to their PS2 counterparts. The coaches look very good, but there isn't the same Xbox-PS2 leap in quality that we see with the players on the field. So you're getting stunning Xbox quality graphics 95% of the time and really you can only tell during the 3-4 seconds after a play where you get to see the player faces and jerseys up close.   But really this is the only nitpicking that can be made about the Xbox graphics for Madden 2002.   Sound Unfortunately the audio elements of Madden have been backsliding the past few years on all platforms. Each year the standard is higher, yet John Madden's commentary itself stays the same. For example in Madden 2001 on the PS2 when you asked for help calling a play, you'd get audio advice from some generic offensive coordinator. In Madden 2002, on both PS2 and Xbox, the improvement is you get John  Madden himself giving you advice using the same exact phrases.   Likewise the in-game announcing gets way more repetitive than what I'd expect from such a powerful console. Even if you can ignore the other signs, the commentary is the extremely strong evidence of the ~portation~ of Madden 2002 from PS2 to Xbox. If you never owned or played the PS2 football game, this likely won't bother you as much. But if you know anything about football at all you know that John Madden shouldn't be commenting on a guy ~closing in on 100 yards~ on his third carry of the game in the first quarter. Unless he just broke off a 95 yard run, I don't want to hear stuff like that. EA Sports has nailed the television style presentation, so Madden and Pat Summerall's interaction comes off very natural, even if it is repetitive and untimely.  Music in the game comes down to a matter of taste. I had no problem with the Beatnuts and Xzibit in the Madden 2001 and for 2002, Pharoah Monche is just fine by me. But if you don't want to mix your hip hop in with your NFL football, then you'll just have to turn the sound down. The music tracks are very well produced, however, and besides there are a lot more annoying things to listen to while you're setting up your game.  In the end, Madden 2002 is a solid football game, but there's no hiding from the fact that it wasn't specifically built to take advantage of the Xbox's capabilities. Because of this, I can't shake the feeling that this game isn't all that it could've been. The improvements in graphics are definitely noticable but not on par with what we expect from the Xbox. But the 64 dollar question is which game is the best out of NFL 2K2, Madden 2002 and NFL Fever 2002. And I can only give the same answer I've been giving: Fever and NFL 2K2 are in more direct competition with each other than with Madden 2002. There's an obvious arcade-leaning gameplay mechanic in Fever and 2K2 that Madden just does not have. The EA game requires a play style that's been refined, learned and accepted over the years that can be pretty unforgiving to the uninitiated, but that is its charm. When I look at Madden objectively, which we try to do here, it plays a lot slower than either of the other two games, but I also see that it's intentional. Madden 2002 isn't going to wow you with its speed --even if you're running the ball with Edgerrin James-- because you're supposed to be awed by its authentic blocking and defensive AI.It's NFL substance over style that we've come to expect from Madden games and that's what Madden NFL 2002 gives us.", "date": "Nov 9, 2001"}
