{"name": "Soul Reaver 2: Legacy of Kain", "name_review": "Soul Reaver 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/08/soul-reaver-2", "text": "In 1996 a man named Kain was unjustly and viciously slain on the Playstation and later resurrected under the veil of the darkest of magic as a vengeful, bloodthirsty vampire (well, he wasn't actually killed whilst literally standing atop a PSOne in the year of 1996, but you get the idea). Now, some five years later, the third installment in the universe that began as an action RPG sees Raziel, another man (but more of a kick ass hero in his first life than the pampered and wealthy Kain was) resurrected vampire. Unlike the power mad, almost racist Kain, Raziel's only vampiric ambition in his un-life is to destroy his creator... The irony? That creator would be none other than Kain himself.  Those completely unfamiliar with either the first or second installments in the series will be rightfully overwhelmed by the immediacy and suddenty of the way the story begins. It takes some time to figure out just what the heck is going on. This was done intentionally because Soul Reaver 2 actually picks up at the moment Soul Reaver left off (Raziel chasing Kain into what amounts to a time portal).  But for those unaware, it's going to take some time after this to be able to discern the meanings of everything. A quick read through the instruction manual and its informative but relatively brief summation of the backstory instantaneously remedies this problem, but that's not to say a quick in-game ~Last time on Soul Reaver~ couldn't have helped.  Chase Kain through the chronoplast (time warping thingy not at all dissimilar from Tal's ~swamp car~) and kill his punk ass, leaving him in the grass or swimming with some bass in this third person action/adventure gas. That's the gist of it, plot twists aside, and sans the horrendous rhyme. The premise sounds basic, but I assure you that both development and delivery are superb (the arguably anti-climatic ending aside).   See, what makes the story, and the game, so enthralling is how its progression and development are conveyed to the player. Writing, and the subsequent delivery of this dialog are so well crafted and implemented that they trump most Hollywood blockbusters (certainly every single thing that has ever or will ever star Freddy Prinze Jr. anyway, if you can classify such a thing's script as ~writing~). Our antihero Raziel is the tormented vampire lusting for the blood of his vicious creator Kain. But more than just a visceral monster, he eloquently ascribes nobility and true heroism. His previous life as a Serafam (group of ultra bad assed warriors of light who took on anything evil, especially vampires) shines through in his tone and phrases. Monster and murderer that he is, Raziel still commands an immense degree of respect and even idolization (the way Raziel doesn't even consider the possibility that Kain could take him in a fight whenever they meet). Despite being a horrific beast, he's portrayed in such a way to be believably good. Conversely, Kain is demented, evil, but still wiser than he appears. Both, and indeed everyone else therein, are played to utter perfection.    The conversations are wonderfully intellectual. Not only do they speak in keeping with the theme, but the dialect is also never ~dumbed down.~ Just listening to the story -- watching it unfold -- it was my impression that the developers made the game for themselves and not for childish masses. It's so enjoyable because the characters speak as they do, as they should, as you would think them to in your mind. Some argue that the speech can actually become more of a pretentious preach, but I looked deeper and saw it all as wonderfully in-keeping with character. All this is enjoyed via a vast number of in-game cutscenes (the engine is no slouch after all) and a lesser number of solidly rendered CG ones... Simply superb.  Now that you know for certain you'll at least be in for an involving treat, it should be known that the rest of the game manages to follow suite in terms of quality with only a few marring inconveniences.  As mentioned, Soul Reaver 2 is a third person action adventure. Like the original, it's focused heavily on combat with puzzle and platforming elements interspersed throughout (all three facets receive sizable improvements over those of the game's predecessor).  Combat is still of the rudimentary punch, kick, projectile variety, and includes a helpful, if at times awkward targeting system. Not all that dissimilar from Zelda's (but still also not as refined as), the new targeting system allows you to lock onto and engage closest foes directly without having to cumbersomely run about vainly slashing every which way. The problem is that the majorly free-roaming camera doesn't always play well with this new targeting method. Because in combat it becomes crucial to master jump dodging (holding jump and pressing a direction will quickly move Raziel in that corresponding direction when locked on to an enemy), it also becomes necessary to be able to quickly gauge relative direction to your enemy. Circling about them with the camera sometimes placed in precarious angles can make this snap judgment a bit trying. Split seconds wasted could spell for more hits sustained. It comes off well with practice (better than before anyway), but could have used a bit more polish. More instances of the camera reverting to a static over-the-shoulder perspective in combat would have helped.   I also feel strongly that the rest of combat would have benefited from more intricacy and complexity. As it stands, only being able to punch, heavy punch, block and throw stuff (weapons and energy crap from the first person) can lead to bouts of repetition. Somewhat more developed combos and even grappling (provided they tightened up collision detection) would have been awesome. Being able to pick up an assortment of weapons, and even beginning the game with the Soul Reaver itself  (powerful symbiotic sword melded with Raziel that actually devours souls) is cool, but there is still some work left to be desired. Blocking, jump dodging, attacking, and initiating one of the pointless but satisfying finishing moves still nevertheless manages to be passable and enjoyable, even though getting hurt only means you have to gorge yourself on more souls to replenish your vitality. I'm not asking or expecting a Dead or Alive fighting system, but even something just a bit more developed (Batman Vengeance) could have significantly improved the overall experience.  Platforming and exploration aren't nearly as prominent as in Super Mario 64 or Tomb Raider, but play out in the totally linear level designs as mere means to get from point A to B and see the stuff in-between. The puzzles, on the other hand, play more of a recognizable role. Thankfully, gone are the tedious and overused giant block puzzles that so readily plagued the first Soul Reaver. These new ones, obviously still nowhere near the level of intricacy and presentation as Project Eden's, rely more heavily on environment and lighting. They also don't come into play nearly as often as in the first title, but are now larger and spaced farther between one another, giving each a higher degree of importance and appreciation (not taking into consideration more frequent times when spectral shifting is required to circumvent a specific area).   Not quite a graphical marvel (but still gorgeous), Soul Reaver 2 effortlessly draws lush, vast outdoor regions and meticulously detailed indoor environments. Actually, that statement is a bit incorrect. More accurately, Soul Reaver 2 effortlessly draws one awesome environment... There is no loading...ever. Transitions from dank caves to outdoor grottos to castles are all seamless. This expansiveness aside, there is no real non-linearity involved. You just move from one place to the next, and often times back from that place to the one before. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a thing worth mentioning so those expecting a sort of free roaming RPG experience won't find themselves sorely disappointed.  More graphical prowess comes from texturing, characters, and effects. Even though the game is a port of the PS2 version, Soul Reaver 2 still exhibits some surprisingly crisp textures, dotted by the occasionally drab ones. But still more profound and visually apparent than this are the characters that all come well modeled (a testament to the PS2's ability to draw tons of polygons), and decently animated. Only decently because in combat they can seem a bit stiff, a problem that doesn't affect the various facial animations at all. The character Moebius, for instance, features amazingly articulated facial expressions that go practically unrivaled in games of this sort and end up the perfect compliment to his already superb acting talent.   The game will take casual to avid gamers approximately 15-20 hours to complete, and because at its completion there is really no other reason to play, this may leave a lot of people wanting a much lengthier experience. I wouldn't be one of them. Titles of this size and longevity are perfect in my eyes, especially considering their nature and inherent tendency to bore after drawn out plays. A lot of time may be spent back tracking and reattempting failed areas (because saving can only be done at checkpoints to preserve the validity and usefulness of the spectral plane), but this will be time well spent. Partly because the game is a delight on the senses and partly because its pretty damn fun to play.  Fans of the original should be on their way to the store as I write this, or even already coming back from it. Similarly, those inexperienced with the universe will no doubt find this to be an excellent and recommended first foray. It's a respectable action game with decent puzzle elements and moderate platforming that will appeal to both players of the genre and believers in the fiction. If anything, buy it just to appreciate the marvelous writing and acting. The more of you who purchase this, the more likely it will be that games like Dragonriders: Chronicles of Pern go unmade (horrible everything, including acting).  -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
