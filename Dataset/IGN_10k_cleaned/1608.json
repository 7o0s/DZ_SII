Just when I thought I'd removed myself from the dark shadow that was Fighting Force 2, comes its happily bouncing baby brother. Seemingly cast out of the same mold in the video game idea factory as that dud, Mattel Interactive's silicon treatment of their ultra popular Max Steel cartoon is less than entertaining. In fact, I was so bothered by this lackluster treatment, that I quickly scrambled over to my notepad in hopes of coming up with as many derogatory pseudonyms for the game as humanly possible.  And though I will spare all of human kind from the whopper-like insults that my twisted and fragile imagination managed to conjure, I can tell you this much; Max Steel is easily one of the most disappointing games of the year!  I couldn't believe it really. After putting together a two-hit combo for the ages with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and it's sequel Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, I had thought that the developer Treyarch was as unstoppable as the Juggernaut himself. The crystal ball that I kept in my sock drawer had begun to light up every other day spouting infinite lines of repeating wisdom; ~This is the developer to watch.~ it muttered, ~They will provide many sessions of happy gaming, keep your eyes peeled~. That said, I'm incredibly close to smashing that thing into itsy bitsy pieces.  Not that any developer is perfect by any means. As even the most beloved in our group of preferred programmers have stumbled and fallen to the concrete on more than one occasion. My hopes for Treyarch and its stellar team of designers are still rather high, but the disappointment I felt with their latest offering lingers around my Dreamcast like a gigantic Homer Simpson belch. But enough ranting I say, on with the review!  Structured around a similar premise to the Metal Gear Solid and Syphon Filter games to be found on Sony's PlayStation, Max Steel in actuality, has the right idea at its heart. Trying to divide the responsibilities equally between puzzle solving, espionage, and violence, the early sessions of your adventure can start off rather intriguingly. Crawl through hidden passages; find secret color-coded computer keys, and beat the living hell out of any man or robot that gets in your way, and your chance at finding some real fun in the beginning are genuine. That is until you realize that the game repeats itself over and over to a point so extreme, it redefines the word ~repetition~.  Part of the problem lies in the lack of diversity from level to level. Comprised mostly of tunnels, small outdoor arenas, and increasingly elongated tunnels again, the scenery appears to be rehashed versions of the level before it on a scale of infinite proportions. Attractive as the environments may be, the severe feeling of dj vu to be found from stage to stage is so annoying you may never want to finish them at all. ~How many times can I look for a secret combination to locked door number 30 before I go insane anyway?~ Play Max Steel for more than an hour, and the answer to that question will be resolved in the harshest of ways.  The second bother would have to be with the limited move set. Armed with a couple of punches, kicks, and source-lit weapons straight out of Mars Attacks, our hero can't fight very effectively. While it's true that the special effects from explosions and lasers are some of the best I've seen in awhile, the accuracy of such weapons, and the need for anything other than a grenade and a couple of flip kicks is futile. Apparently thrown in just for the hell of it, your opposition is so weak that the bigger items in your arsenal aren't even needed. What's the point of blasting everyone to smithereens in sniper mode when you can just run up and kick them a couple of times and be done with it?  And that unfortunately is the type of atmosphere surrounding the entire game; Kick and punch your way through the same boring set of enemies as quickly as possible, only to move onto another doppelganger of that stage to do it all over again. Stare at the pretty graphics all you want, poor gameplay is poor gameplay.  What else is there to say about Max Steel other than don't buy it? With nothing else going for it besides a respectable visual presence, this one is better left on the shelf. A great way to convince your friends that cartoons are better left to Saturday mornings, Max Steel should be at the bottom of everyone's wish lists (or steel-toed boots, whichever you prefer).  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 7, 2000"}
