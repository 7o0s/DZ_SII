In fact, if you switched the analytical part of the brain off (a.k.a. jamming a pencil up your nose), it was actually pretty good fun. Sure, it may not have taken a game design genius to come up with Full Auto's 'cars + guns + rewinding time + environmental destruction = good times' equation, but the end result was combative arcade racing through environments just begging to be levelled to the ground.   In many ways Full Auto 2 represents a do-over. It's not really a fully fledged sequel, instead being based around redesigned versions of the courses from the original, with a number of liberal changes and tweaks to the game's structure. In fact, it's probably best to think of Full Auto 2 as a window into the collective mind of development house Pseudo Interactive. Everything they've changed, added or taken away is presumably aimed at rectifying perceived flaws in the original or at least trying to tap into what the team thinks PS3 owners want to play.   So has the team got it right? Have they taken a game that showed plenty of potential and pushed the engine to its limits? Or have they driven the series unceremoniously off a pier and into the gaming ocean, to be swallowed into the depths, and never heard from again? Probably closer to the latter unfortunately.    See what the U.S. IGN guys thought of Full Auto 2.   Perhaps the biggest legitimate addition to Full Auto 2's game design is the new arena gameplay. You all know what to expect here - choose a car and weapon load-out, then go deal some automotive death in one of a number of large, enclosed areas. Along the way you can pick up a bunch of power-ups, ranging from insta-repairs to nail bomb launchers, as well as triggering massive layout-changing events. So far so good, but this seemingly straightforward inclusion has a negative knock-on effect across the entire game.   For a start, the somewhat clunky, but weighty handling of the original has been overhauled, replaced by twitchy fluff. In an effort to give players more control in the arena mode, cars now feel light as a feather - if you so much as tap a wall, you're sent spinning, while the handbrake is positively hyperactive. That's fine for duking it out in a pit of rubble strewn death, but for fanging along downtown streets, you really need to be able to swing that back end out around corners without fear of doing a 180 and coming to a stop or clipping a wall, doing a 720, then coming to a stop. Granted, you can use unwreck (now on the one bar, along with boost) to try again, but the core mechanics themselves should be solid enough that this isn't required quite so often.   Apparently you're a cop or something eliminating crime by eliminating the city in which crime can take place.  The arena combat has also wormed its way into the game's Career Mode, so if you just want to do the race challenges - bad luck, you've got to do both. Not that the arena gameplay is bad. It's more that it ultimately feels pretty soulless against AI opponents, particularly when they have a habit of ganging up on you, and bosses are a little too adept at going on repair kit runs when they sustain some damage. Fair enough, but it can be frustrating - especially when you're on a time limit. Plus, while the handling may be twitchier than it once was, the whole affair still feels cumbersome and clumsy, leaving you constantly stopping, backing up and turning around, trying to line up enemies in your sites. And like any arena-based car combat title, you'll find yourself doing tight circles around enemies, trying to get a bead on them, while they do the same. It's a weird combination of chicken and targeting merry-go-round.    Speaking of the Career Mode, Full Auto 2 sees plenty of changes. For one, there's now a ~story~, complete with dispassionate female AI voiceover, which goes along with the admittedly much slicker menu design and presentation. Whatever. Challenges are still divided into series', but instead of the tiered reward structure of the original, each challenge comes with primary objectives that you'll need to beat in order to move on (such as: take out a certain rival and finish first). There are also a number of secondary objectives that you'll need to check off in order to unlock all of the Reward Packs associated with each set of challenges. It's not a huge difference, but to be honest we preferred the original structure.   As you progress through the Career Mode you'll gradually unlock Full Auto 2's expanded arsenal. In addition to the machine guns, smoke screens, grenades, shotguns, missiles and rockets of the original, the sequel introduces lasers, napalm and ram plates into the mix. As before, you choose your vehicle and load-out before going into a mission, which means there's always another combination to try if you can't beat it.   Nothing says tough like a flame paint job. The triple machine gun action probably doesn't hurt either. I guess.  Unfortunately, if you're stuck on a particular mission and just want to hop into the arcade mode or online, you'll be limited to the weapons you've already unlocked, while your opponents are free to use whatever they'd like. This is particularly limiting online, meaning that you have to slog a significant way through the Career Mode before you can really start causing mayhem. And even then you may be facing off against guys with starter kit weapons. This may be the reason that so little action seemed to be taking place when we tested the online modes. We joined the online server with zero kills, yet were still ranked 663 in the world (which jumped up to 452 after netting six kills in our first game). Thankfully the game ran relatively well given that we were playing against Americans. Here's hoping there'll be more activity now that the game is out in Australia and Europe.   Taking several pages from the book of Burnout, the sequel has a much greater sense of speed than the original did (complete with blurring at the edge of screen at high speeds), and utilises a more muted, realistic colour palette. The extra speed is actually to the detriment of the gameplay, as this was never really a series about tight, high-speed handling. At the new top speed the combative elements of the gameplay are less satisfying, and ultimately less important.   Anyone who has played the original game will instantly recognise most of Full Auto 2's courses, although they have been redesigned and given a fresh coat of paint. Many have more alternate routes or shortcuts, and the general flow has been streamlined somewhat to better suit the changes to the gameplay. The tracks in the Outskirts, for instance, were horrid on 360, consisting largely of narrow, winding desert paths with jutting rocks to either side. Clip one, as you invariably would, and it's goodbye ground, hello automotive gymnastics. A trip to the Outskirts in the sequel reveals more variety in the course design and wider paths.   The Outskirts - improved, but still some of the weakest courses in the game.  Unfortunately, the Outskirts are also a prime example that while Full Auto 2 may have taken on a more muted visual style in some areas, as well as dispensing with the overly bump mapped look of the original, it's still just as patchy. The rocky cliffs of the Outskirts look awful, with low resolution texturing and bright, flat lighting that brings no subtlety to the environments. Most areas are lacking in one way or another. Move away from the sunshine of the Outskirts and back into the dense city environments or dilapidated factory runs, and you'll find a murky, washed out quality to the visuals, along with sub-par texturing. It certainly doesn't look bad, and it must be noted that the game runs more smoothly than its 360 forebear did, but Full Auto 2 really isn't a graphical showcase for Sony's new baby. Nor, unfortunately, is it a gameplay showcase.  Perhaps the most damning indication that even Pseudo Interactive may suspect that this game isnt everything it could be, is the jettisoning of that old staple, the confirmation dialogue. In Full Auto 2, when you pause and select quit, the game just does it. Its almost as if its saying, yep, I get it, you really do want to quit.To be fair though, there are plenty of worse PS3 launch titles. Full Auto 2 certainly has its moments, it just fails to make good upon the series potential.Want to have your say about Full Auto 2? Rock on over to the  Aussie forums.", "date": "Mar 23, 2007"}
