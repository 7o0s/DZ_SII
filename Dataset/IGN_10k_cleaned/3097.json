Well, this is in some ways the BMX version of that.  Let me set up the story for you.  In the year 2086, all ~extreme~ sports, BMX, skateboarding, surfing, rollerblading, and yes, scootering, have been outlawed due the evils associated with them.  Because of this effort, the logical thing to do would be to create extreme reality shows, including BMX show, Toxic Grind.   In Toxic Grind (the show), bikers go head-to-head and bike for their lives.  The problem is that they are running out of bikers.  So, like before, the logical thing to do is steal a time machine and pluck BMX bikers from 2002 and force them to compete.  This is where you, Jason Hayes, comes in.  You have unfortunately been chosen and now must battle your way to your freedom.  Oh, and you've been injected with a poison that will steadily kill you  unless you continuously pump your blood full of adrenaline by performing tricks.  Did I mention there's a group of bikers called the Underground that will aid you on your journey.  Where did you meet them?  Uh, good question.    Gameplay  At its core, this game is just another Tony Hawk clone.  You progress through levels completing goals in a set amount of time, the twist here being the storyline.  There are several modes in the game including Underground, Arcade, Pro Circuit, and Multi-player.  Underground is the story mode.  In this mode, you'll watch hand-drawn story sequences between levels and work your way through the levels.  Arcade mode lets you play any level you've already been to, and Pro Circuit mode lets you choose the order of the levels you've already opened up and play them in your own little contest while competing for the best average score.  Boring.     The multi-player mode has four modes: Quick Draw, Score War, Turf War, and Tug of War.  Here's a quick rundown on the goals.  Quick Draw has you trying to beat the other player reach a specified score (10K, 50K, 100K), Score War is a free-for-all battle for points in a set time limit, Turf War is like Graffiti mode in Tony Hawk, and Tug of War has both players starting out with 5000 points.  You steal points from the other player by doing tricks, and the first person to reach 10,000 points wins.  Most of this is pretty standard stuff, with the exception of Tug of War.     Controls are also setup identically to other games (A hops, B does loop tricks, Y grinds, X does hold tricks, and triggers spin) so there is no need to talk about them in detail.  The trick system is not anywhere as deep as the Dave Mirra games but tries to get the job done nonetheless.  What will cause you lots of frustration is the looseness of the controls, along with the floaty physics.  Making your biker do exactly what you want is at times a chore.  It's not really one or the other, but a combination of the two.  You can never really judge what's going to happen, where you're going to land, or if you're going fast enough.  This really hurts a game where precise controls and convincing physics are critical to the enjoyment of the game.  Whatever.   The meat of the game is the story mode.  As you play the levels, you'll be given certain goals to accomplish.  You've done all these before: get X points; do X trick here; etc... Some levels will have you competing in the show where you'll be placed in a round arena competing against another biker, much like the Tug of War mode.  These levels really suck.  There is a spinning blade that always hits you, and you are constantly falling over the edge into grinding blades, thinking your going to grind the rail instead.  The other level designs are equally as boring and uninteresting, and not really worth mention.  Blah.   My train sucks.  Graphics  There are two visual styles used in the game: the in-game engine, and the hand-drawn comic art used to tell the story.  The in-game graphics are very ho-hum.  Ranging from poor to silly to decent, there is not too much to get excited about here.  The models and textures are just average, the lighting barely cutting it, the animation jerky, and the water effects are some of the worst since Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.  While the framerate stays up to par most of the time, it doesn't really matter since there's not much to look at anyways.   The comic book-style graphics used in between levels fare a bit better, but not much.  It's about the quality of a second-tier comic book.  Clashing with the art is a sort of layer/filter that makes everything look like a dirty film print.  While some of the drawings have limited animation, it may have been better to go one way or the other rather than try to create something that looks an unusual mix of styles.            Sound  First things first.  The music in this game is awful.  Recorded straight from the button labeled ~modern hard rock~ on my Casio ES-23KS8, the soundtrack is a complete throwaway.  Some songs maintain the hard rock sound, with others straying more towards pop rock and electronic beat music.  My favorite (worst) part is when there is an artificial sitar being played over the heavy guitar and electronic beat.  Does anybody really listen to this stuff?  For a game that has an extensive story-based mode, the music may have been more dramatic utilizing more of a score approach.  Then again...   The story scenes are voiced over and the results are pretty dull.  The acting is that of a C-movie (Adriana being the exception), especially the villain who tries sounding so sinister he comes off as a clown.  Laughable at best.  The in-game sound effects are more standard fare.  You hear the clank of the rail when grinding, the whir of your bike tires when riding, and the splash of the water when trying to drown yourself in it.  Strangely, whether you're grinding a steel pole or a stone wall, the grinding noise sounds the same.  Oh well.Everything in the game that is used to differentiate itself from other games in the genre adds very little, possibly even making the game worse.  The story really doesn't help this game much and only seems to make the game feel more campy and cheap, though done right, could make for an interesting twist on the genre.  Add that to the sloppy controls, horrendous physics, and the overall rushed feel of the game, and you've got yourself a truly toxic game.  Instead, why don't you play Mirra, Hoffman, or Pacman.", "date": "Oct 23, 2002"}
