RealArcade Mobile's Gem Drop is one of those me-too puzzlers that is by no means a bad game -- it handles the mechanics quite competently -- but any mobile gamer that has been on the scene for more than few months has already seen this type of gem-matching game.   The goal is to create three-or-more groupings of jewels in an ever-growing well of gems. Gems appear along the top of the screen that can be moved quickly before dropping into the well. You need to create enough vanishing trios that you still have room in the well when the dropped gems run out. There are power-up gems that perform special actions, such as the black jewel that eliminates all of the gems of the same color it lands on.   The game screen is clear with the gems not only appearing in different colors, but also slightly varying shapes. This will help speed players tell them apart when trying some of the harder levels.  Now, the mechanics are not exactly the same as, say, Bejeweled or Columns -- but it's so close that I found my interest wane long before it should to justify a purchase. And even if you don't have a gem game on your handset yet, you may want to browse around a bit before committing. Gem Drop, as mentioned, isn't bad. It's just the fifth verse of a song we've heard so many times.", "date": "Apr 12, 2006"}
