The title, which followed the exploits of bumbling would-be hero Dirk the Daring on a quest to rescue Daphne the Princess from the evil Dragon Singe, overflowed with character thanks to some truly incredible animation. But even by the standards of the time, it wasn't so much a videogame as it was a mildly interactive cartoon adventure.  Now, 20 years later, Dirk is back, but this time in fully polygonal 3D. Dragon's Lair 3D returns players to the stubborn, booby-trapped castle of the arcade game and builds in new rooms and enemies, puzzles, new storyline details and more. The end result is both nostalgic and decidedly fresh at the same time. More compelling than any of that, though, is the fact that Dirk himself now comes with full freedom of movement and a host of never-before-seen moves, including the ability to arm and disarm original weapons.   But 20 years is a long time, and while Dirk was on vacation the gaming industry pioneered into the realm of 3D and then released game after game, each more polished than the next. Dragon's Lair 3D for GameCube delivers a fun, light challenge, but the overall experience feels downright clunky by comparison to better 3D adventures like Zelda.  The Facts  Dragon's Lair reborn in full 3D True control over hero Dirk in polygonal 3D environments More than 250 rooms to explore -- seven times of the original arcade game Between 20-30 hours of gameplay Close to 40 different characters -- 20 plus new Cel-shaded graphics and original art by Don Bluth Power-ups, hidden secrets and special unlocks Brand new intro and ending movies animated by Don Bluth 40 original music pieces, totaling more than 90 minutes Brand new Dragon's Lair theme song and music video Dolby Surround Single-player   Gameplay Princess Daphne has been kidnapped and it's Dirk the Daring to the rescue. Sound familiar? It's supposed to be. Dragon's Lair 3D is both a remake of the arcade game and an all-new experience to boot. The same premise is back, and indeed you'll even see many of the same rooms and enemies that the knight first encountered in the early 80s. But on top of that the design team at developer Dragonstone has created some 250 rooms in all for an experience that is seven times the size of the classic and filled with brand new puzzles only possible in 3D, more devious enemies and so much more. It's an ambitious effort for sure and hardcore Dragon's Lair fans in this respect are sure to be pleased.  You control Dirk as he explores the booby-trapped castle, battles with enemies, engages in a series of platformer-styled challenges and generally solves puzzles to advance. As far as action-adventures go, this one's actually pretty basic, seeming to follow the Zelda formula to the best of its abilities. The puzzles, a mixture of good and very sloppy, range from having to position Dirk on the right set of tiles to avoid harm, to flipping a series of switches to activate bridges and doorways, and to simply devising the correct way out of a particular environment. Sometimes it's easier written than done, we can assure you and there is definitely a clear sense of satisfaction with having bested some of the puzzles and challenges. There are times, though, when the ~try, die, and try again~ design -- the backbone of the adventure -- grows extremely thin. It's one thing to meet your end because you miscalculated your defense. It's another thing entirely to find your character ambushed by a booby-trap and killed before you can do anything about it. It's ironic that it's this same formula that both most closely mimics the core of the arcade classic and simultaneously dates the mechanics of the update.    Dragonstone has also worked to mimic the setup of the Zelda series and it some ways it has succeeded. There's no doubting that Dragon's Lair 3D for GameCube lacks polish and it shows. From a camera system that often bangs into walls and barriers and interrupts the pacing to a poor sense of collision detection during enemy battles, and some puzzles that are more baffling than they are obvious, the game could definitely use some improvement. And yet, this doesn't negate the fact that there is at least a useable lock-on feature in place or that the camera system works well enough to get the job done (and can be manually manipulated), which are two claims that at least some other adventure titles cannot make.      Dirk moves slowly, but can be made to run with the L button. Strangely, the developer has opted to utilize the B button to lock-on to enemies and center the camera -- an odd choice, but it works. Meanwhile, A is used as the action button, R to duck, and Y to jump. D-Pad down draws and holsters Dirk's sword. The setup is not nearly as intuitive as in some other adventures -- again, the Zelda franchise comes to mind, but once more it works well enough to get the job done. There is the occasional frustration in regard to locking onto enemies and collision detection, as both aspects seem faulty at best. However, with some practice these control obstacles are hurdled and before long you'll be able to make Dirk jump and grab onto ledges, quickly grab his sword, and center the camera without much thought.  As the character advances, he picks up new weapons and abilities, including a peculiar piece of magic that enables him to float across gaps -- a feat that is helpful and amusing as Dirk reacts to it with fear. He can likewise shoot arrows at opponents to take them down. These extras inject a certain amount of freshness into the experience that, along with the new puzzles, is welcomed.  At the end of the day, Dragonstone has succeeded in successfully recreating the arcade game in full 3D, and for that we tip our hat to the company. But it's too little and too late. For seasoned adventure fans, Zelda is where it's at, and games like Star Fox Adventures and certainly Metroid Prime far out-deliver what this one has to offer both in terms of design and execution. That doesn't make Dragon's Lair 3D a bad game -- it isn't. But it has a way to go to play with the big boys.   Graphics Dragon's Lair 3D looks strikingly similar to the original arcade game, which in of itself is a substantial feat. The game employs beautiful cel-shading techniques so that characters feature outlines that make them look as if they've been cut right out of a cartoon reel. Given the original's primary appeal, the eye-popping artistry of Bluth, it's something of a necessity that the update retains the same style and for the most part it has. The environments, like the characters, are now in full 3D, and impressively huge and varied. The worlds are often tiled seamlessly with detailed, colorful textures that resemble hand painted landscapes, and there are times when it's truly hard to tell the game from the cartoon.   But there are a couple of shortcomings. The first is that some of the textures in the title fail to live up to the rest and as a result you'll notice the occasionally all-too blurry spot -- say, a door that looks like a brown mesh more than it does anything else. The second problem is that whether because of the shoddy fluidity, 30 frames per second with constant dips below, or because of time or technical constraints, some of the character animation is lacking, and that's a true disappointment.   With pre-lit worlds and a hefty particle system to boot, the game does its best to dazzle with extra visual bells and whistles and it generally does. Meanwhile, the locales and enemies are varied and refreshingly colorful, which is something you don't see as often in the industry today as so many games are intentionally dark and gritty.  Sound A beautiful musical score accompanies a wide host of goofy sound effects and some extremely over-the-top acting for the voice of Princess Daphne, a character that interrupts the game with helpful hints. Though Dragonstone hasn't gone out of its way to support GameCube's audio abilities, the listening experience is still a solid, crisp one. But there is one major problem. The game occasionally chugs down so badly that music and speech momentarily cuts out -- which is simply unforgivable.   Dirk's transition to the realm of 3D hasn't been without drawbacks, but Dragon's Lair 3D is still a fun romp through the castle again with enough new rooms, puzzles and challenges, enemies, and upgrades to warrant a serious consideration for any fan of the arcade classic. The game is fun and entertaining enough, but it has problems. It lacks a certain polish that's overwhelmingly present in some other, better action-adventures. If you're willing to forgive a sometimes-stubborn camera system, some collision detection issues and a sloppy framerate, though, you might just learn to like the Zelda-inspired control scheme and classic styled puzzles.Recommended for diehard Dragon's Lair junkies.
