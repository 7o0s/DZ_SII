Not with a vengeance, but with a laugh track. The motley crew of snoops has made the transition from the TV to Xbox and with the aid of THQ and developer Heavy Iron (of Evil Dead fame), Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is not the horrible old license usery of the past. This Scooby-Doo game actually has merit (in a manner of speaking), it doesn't take itself seriously (which is good), and it looks and feels like the show, which is appealing beyond just the nostalgia of it all. And yes, it really does have a laugh track.   Gameplay   Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is a hybrid platformer, part 2 1/2, occasionally 3D, but always aiming to please gamers with traditional gameplay tactics while re-creating the spooky, silly settings of the show.    Taking on the role of Scooby himself, players learn how to maneuver through 12 levels of puzzle-laden, platform-heavy gameplay. It feels like a tongue-in-cheek parody of the formulaic platform game, while also clearly being the object of the parody itself. You jump and smack stuff, avoid baddies, use timing and highly tuned twitch skills to get from point A to point B, uncover hidden doors, unlock previously hidden doors, and collect Scooby snacks to open new passages into spooky new levels. And all with a little whiff of smoke and a smile.   Scooby feels remarkably good as a platform character, and Heavy Iron has complemented the standard jump-and-smack model with bonus items, special attack items, and slick environments in which to play. For instance, in the very beginning, Scooby encounters a training area, which prepares him for the adventures to come. There are swings from which he can jump, cling, and swing from, sandy areas, in which he moves slowly and ploddingly, and icy areas that are terribly slippery and dangerous.    The game is packed with variations like this, which add enough extra color that it is fun enough to play all the way through. Granted, Scooby-Doo is no Klonoa 2, but it's remarkably likeable. Heavy Iron probably had a lot of fun making this game and the final result is slightly humorous, mildly entertaining, and a tight, well done production.   The story, well, it's just as hokey as any of the Scooby-Doo shows ever were. Here, Daphne's friend whose uncle is some kind of special scientist and who happens to live in a mansion that's, wait for it, haunted, is having problems with that. At the game's outset, you (Scooby) and the gang arrive at the mansion in the hot, sex-mobile, the Mystery Machine. The dark and evil atmosphere is replete with swarms of bats flying around in a bloody fit, while dangerous wolves howl at the full moon. Naturally, Daphne's friend is a young, nubile female who's just standing outside, happily unaffected by all of the terrible frightful occurrences around her. ~Like, oh my God! Thanks for coming guys!~   The story is classic, or at the very least, familiar territory. The brain is told to shut off while the silly, sophomoric humor begins. Classic lines, such as ~No, wait, Scoob!~ ~Shaggggyy! Ovvvveeeeer here-ere!!~ and other more are here. And don't worry, the banter of stoner food and paranoia jokes abound. What makes the whole thing work is that the phony laugh track from the cartoon is included, and it works wonders! I believe it's a first for any videogame.    Heavy Iron's sense of humor is key to enjoying Scooby-Doo. The game never takes itself seriously for a second, a major part of the appeal. It's funny to laugh with, and to laugh at. You're never scared or terrified by any of the dim-witted ghosts in sheets, witches, or freaks of nature (there are 20 in all) that the game throws at you.    The level construction is smartly designed. Gamers collect Scooby snacks to progress, and as they do so, they'll collect more to open up other levels. But not every item or path can be used right away. As you open up new levels you'll earn, find, or buy special items such as an extra high jump or a football helmet (for ramming), each of which enable Scooby to do things he wasn't able to do before. So with the newer items in paw, revisiting those first few levels proves to be worthwhile.   Graphics   In its own way, Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is a good-looking game. Not in the traditional sense, mind you. It's not a burning, next-generation polygon-pushing powerhouse or technology-bending achievement. Rather, Heavy Iron's game does an extraordinary job of looking and playing just like the TV cartoon. The game achieves that to a T, and even if you aren't a big Scooby-Doo fan (is there such a creature?), it's hard not to look in wonder at the perfectly re-created backgrounds, crooked haunted houses, silly enemies, and perfectly created models of Daphne, Velma, Fred, Scooby and Shaggy.    The textures are entirely simplistic, the backgrounds average, and the worlds aren't even that big or impressive. But the game looks and feels like a Scooby-Doo cartoon, and so it feels like you're playing the cartoon.   Sound   The other excellent aspect of the production is the sound department. The game features the authentic voiceovers of Don Knotts, Tim Conway and Tim Curry, and the voice cast from the current TV cartoon. So, when you hear Shaggy and Scooby-Doo yapping at each other, or Velma and Daphne figuring out clues, you are hearing the same exact voices from the show. The effect works. In fact, the voice actor who acted out the character Fred is from the original TV cartoon from the '70s, so he's oh-so authentic in the game.    As for the music, the classic intro song is there in all of its cheesy, formulaic, stoner glory. And again, like the other aspects of the game, the authenticity helps to make the game look, feel, and sound just like the show. Which is a good thing.   Scooby-Doo is many things, but it's definitely not a hard-core Tekken fan's idea of fun; this I can say with sheer sincerity. In fact, I'd say it's not going to be a love-fest for any hardcore gamer. But it's really not meant to be. Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is a fun, light-weight platformer that's got solid gameplay, respectable productions values, and a great sense of humor to back it up. For parents with kids, or old hippies who just can't handle today's grim prospects of war, terrorism, or reality TV, Scooby-Doo: Night of 100 Frights is a wonderful escape into the wonders of cheesy TV, only this time you can play the show on your Xbox. It's fun for what it is, surprisingly so.", "date": "Oct 15, 2003"}
