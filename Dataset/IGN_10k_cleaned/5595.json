With all due respect for the deprivation and danger inherent in being a ball turret gunner or an OSS agent, the life of the submariner wasn't likely to inspire envy. But that doesn't mean that the life of the submariner doesn't make for a thrilling simulation. The new game Silent Hunter III recreates that world in as exciting and exacting a way as any submarine sim before it.  Silently stalking a merchant ship, the U-boat crew has to be smart, patient and exacting. After finding and following their prey, the U-boat crew has to fire off their torpedoes and then sneak away before the target's escorts can counterattack. In a way, sub sims play like Hitman; you just never want to go toe-to-toe with your enemies. Though submarines have fought in numerous theaters in numerous wars, the German Wolfpack's operations in the Atlantic represented here is the most classic image of submarine warfare.  Developed by Ubisoft Romania, Silent Hunter III wonderfully simulates these battles for control of the Atlantic. You play as the commander of one of these U-boats in careers that span the whole length of submarine warfare. You can opt to begin in 1939 when the U-boats first began to attack Allied shipping or start later in 1943 once the tide of war had turned against the submariners.   As the commander of the submarine, you'll be responsible for a variety of tasks. First, you'll need to set a course, running fast along the surface at night and creeping below the waterline during the day when spotters are more likely to see you. When you spot an enemy, you'll have to determine the best way to engage them and the best way to escape if you're detected. But though those are the basics, there are a number of complex systems you'll have to learn to manage in order to make this all happen. While you can order your crew to take charge of some of these systems, you'll find you get more enjoyment out of the game if you take a more hands on approach.   The tutorials are fantastic. In addition to offering a text-based explanation of the keys and commands that need to be used, there are also movie files that show where everything is and how it all works together. After watching this, you can take actual exams that put you in charge of your own sub. Getting some hands on time with the various systems before heading off into the campaign is definitely a good idea. That way you'll be prepared to launch the deck guns yourself, or man the flak cannons personally if need be.  The variety of realism options let novice and experienced gamers each get a satisfying experience. On the more casual side you can opt to play without torpedo duds and much quicker reload times. If you really want to get the full experience, you can set the game up so you have to plot your own firing solutions and carefully monitor your oxygen levels while submerged. The only real problem with the realism is that your crew will automatically alert you when a ship has taken enough damage to be classified as destroyed. Since knowing whether or not you've scored a fatal hit on a ship can have serious ramifications, it would be nice if the game was a bit more vague about your successes.  The campaign missions here are much better than the heavily scripted missions from Silent Hunter II. You're still expected to achieve some basic objectives in each mission but there's plenty of room to engage targets of opportunity. Patrol missions sometimes yield up no targets, so you'll want to be on the lookout for fat, unprotected cargo ships on your way home. The time compression works well to eliminate the monotony of month-long sub patrols.  The AI provides a great challenge. The destroyer escorts are very aggressive and work in conjunction with anti-submarine airplanes. I've even had destroyer escorts crash into my periscope to render it unusable. The merchant ship AI is good enough to tack when it senses danger. Unfortunately, you'll sometimes come across merchant ships that aren't moving at all. They just sit there and let you torpedo them. I checked a few of these out to see if they might radio for help but after sitting beside a stationary tanker for two days, I gave up and went home -- after sinking her, of course.    Silent Hunter III is the best looking submarine simulation around. There are tons of visual details in the simulation. The interior of the subs are rendered in full 3D. Inside the submarine, you can see all the crewmembers working at their stations. There's not a lot of variety in terms of crewmember appearance from boat to boat but the addition of some distinct character models adds a bit of life to the game. When your ship starts getting hit, you'll be able to see even more life and animation down here. When depth charges are exploding around you, you'll see the lights flicker and the ship heel from side to side. If the damage gets really bad, you'll actually see pipes burst and start spraying water around inside the hull.  These cinematic moments are also present outside of the submarine. When a torpedo is about to strike, you can switch to an external camera that shows the torpedo speeding along to its target. Once the torpedo hits, the view moves above the water to show the explosions and fires the hit causes. Other cinematic moments are offered when a ship sinks or when destroyers or aircraft are making attack runs on your ship. The sinking ship is pretty awesome. Each ship sinks in a unique way. Some split in half, some roll over on their side, and some go stern or bow first beneath the waves. The camera follows the ship below the waterline and lets you get a good view of her as she tumbles to the sea floor.  One cinematic moment that's notable in its absence is the implosion of your own submarine. At some point you'll have taken so much damage that you just keep sinking lower and lower. Watching the depth meter drop and listening to the creak of the hull around you is a very unsettling experience but it's kind of ruined when the game suddenly switches to a failure screen. Morbid as it sounds, I'd really love the sub crush under the weight.  The water modeling is amazing. I haven't ever seen a wave model this convincing. Though things get a little chunky at the horizon, the waves look and move completely realistically. You'll even see waves wash up over the periscope lens, temporarily blurring your vision. When the periscope dips below the water level, you'll see the wonderful textures on the sea floor and watch as bubbles rise up from the hull of your sub.   Everything around you looks fantastic. The ship models are superlative. Rust stains streak down from the portholes of large ships, crates cover the deck of merchant ships, and sailors man the guns on destroyers. If your patrol starts in the morning, you'll even see well-wishers waving goodbye and a military band playing on the pier as your sub slides out of its pen. Really fantastic stuff here.  Best of all, the ship models blow up real nice too! When a torpedo strikes a ship you'll see a huge blast of water alongside and flames and smoke will start to rise from the hull. Heavily damaged ships will be rocked with explosions that will send crates and lifeboats flying up into the air. You can see some great examples of the explosions in the screenshots. The only real problem is that there's no damage modeling below the waterline. I'd really like to have seen scorch marks and model deformation to represent torpedo hits.  The sounds of the game are very good. Hearing the hull creak as you dive and surface really brings the danger of the submarine life home. The various pings and propeller noises are authentic and help to create awareness of the situation around you. Explosions and weapon fire are also handled well. Less obvious are the small ambient noises: the spray over the bow, for instance, doesn't really bowl you over but it's a nice touch that adds another layer of believability to the game.  Lastly, the game offers multiplayer right out of the box. The only trouble is that there aren't too many sessions available and most of them are password protected. Without knowing a player beforehand, it's going to be hard to just log on and get an hour or so in at a whim.Silent Hunter III was definitely worth the wait. The campaign is fantastic and the overall presentation is a sim fan's dream. While most sims tend to focus on detail for detail's sake, Silent Hunter III puts the obscure procedures involved in running a U-boat into an instantly engaging context. Sure, there are down times and, sure, the work of running a U-boat is sometimes tedious but the overall excitement of stalking and sinking a target and then sneaking away is very clear here. The cinematic moments are simply thrilling. It sure doesn't hurt that the game looks fantastic.Since the PC catalog can't support multiple submarine sims, fans have had to take what they could get. Sometimes this meant settling for a relatively uninspired title. Silent Hunter III definitely makes up for the lean years. It also sets the bar very high for Silent Hunter IV.", "date": "Mar 18, 2005"}
