Atari: 80 Classic Games in One comes packed to the brim with--yep, you guessed it--80 classic Atari games! But don't get your O.P. short shorts in a bunch just yet. Unless you're a veteran gamer (for example, you know what an Atari ~paddle controller~  looks like) you might want to spend your 20 bucks elsewhere.  80 Classic Games is like going to a reunion, seeing tons of old friends you've neglected to keep in touch with, and realizing they haven't changed a bit. If you had never met those friends (i.e., not played the games), the reunion would seem pretty boring. Nostalgia is the key word here. That being said, all of the classic Atari games I remember playing as a kid are on this disc. Some of my old favorites include Adventure, Haunted House, Star Ship, Surround and the arcade version of Crystal Castles. However, since the compilation consists of all first-party Atari games, missing are some of the third-party whoppers. The inclusion of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Galaxian, Frogger, Pitfall or for that matter, the excellent-but-rare Pitfall II: Lost Caverns would have required the manifestation of a small legal miracle (and may just have caused my head to implode from sheer gaming ecstasy), but it's disappointing to not have all the great 2600 games in one place.  In addition to the games, this package comes loaded with special features. We've seen the bonus material before on older Atari compilations like Atari Anniversary Edition and Atari Greatest Hits, but things like images of original box art and cartridges and game documentation scans including some great DC comic books for Centipede and Swordquest: Earthworld are all quite novel and will bring a smile to any old-school gamers face. There's also a short series of video interviews with Nolan Bushnell (the Atari-meister himself) which includes discussions of the creation of the company and it got its name (it's derived from the Japanese game called ~Go~). However, since the special features are a few years old, they're definitely showing their age. A DVD-quality redux of the low-res bonus material should have been included and is a necessity for any future Atari compilations.    Back in the day, part of the fun of playing an Atari game was figuring out exactly how to play it. Instruction manuals were not the novellas they are now, and games like Swordquest that simply required you ~find the hidden clues and solve the puzzle~ were part of the Atari experience. If you're in doubt, ample documentation, game options, and tutorial text are present to help you figure out exactly how to play a game. Some notable exceptions to this rule include the enigmatic Basic Programming and the parser strategy Stellar Track. If you're into having any fun, you probably won't be playing these games anyway.  Here's the rundown of the included Atari arcade titles: Asteroids Asteroids Dlx Black Widow Centipede Gravitar  Crystal Castles Liberator Lunar Lander  Major Havoc  Millipede  Missile Command  Pong  Red Baron  Super Breakout  Space Duel  Tempest Warlords    Here's the rundown of the 2600 titles: 3D Tic-Tac-Toe A Game of Concentration  Adventure Air-Sea Battle  Asteroids  Battlezone Bowling Breakout Canyon Bomber  Casino Centipede Circus Atari  Codebreaker Combat Crystal Castles  Demon to Diamonds Dodge 'em Double Dunk  Flag Capture  Football Fun With Numbers  Golf Fun With Numbers  Golf  Gravitar  Haunted House  Home Run  Human Cannonball  Math Gran Prix  Maze Craze  Millipede  Miniature Golf  Missile Command  Night Driver  Outlaw  Quadrun Radar Lock  Realsports Baseball  Realsports Football  Realsports Tennis  Realsports Volleyball Sky Diver  Slot Machine  Slot Racers  Space War  Star Raiders  Star Ship  Stellar Track  Street Racer  Submarine Commander  Super Baseball  Super Breakout  Super Football  Surround  Swordquest: Earthworld  Swordquest: Fireworld  Swordquest: Waterworld  Video Checkers  Video Chess  Video Olympics  Video Pinball  Warlords  Yar's Revenge   Let's be honest, though: The graphics in Atari 2600 games stink by today's standards. Most of the games show your character (a blocky shape) throwing something (a line shape) or wielding a weapon (an arrow shape) to destroy enemies that come in all sorts of geometric variations. Anti-aliasing is nonexistent, the pixels are huge, and the screen will flicker when there are too many sprites on screen. The wire frame vector graphics in games like Tempest and Major Havoc are by far the coolest, and the more advanced games in the ~Arcade Classics~ section will undoubtedly get the most play time.  Similarly, the sound in 80 Classic Games consists of beeps, boops, and the occasional digital melody. Retro samples are back in a big way, however, and some games have trippy tunes and even speech (as in Quad Run) that any electronic music artist would do good to check out. Electronic games have come a hell of a long way in the past twenty-five years.  To view modern day classics like Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Warcraft III and realize that they arguably evolved from Adventure and Combat is enough to blow your mind. For gamers pushing thirty, Atari 80 is a window to the past and the essential anthology of Atari classics. For the uninitiated, 80 Classic Games could be the first course book in your self-education of ~The History of Electronic Gaming.~ If ~course book~ isn't a phrase you want associated with your PC gaming, then pass on this compilation. But if you believe in video games as something more than a simple pastime, 80 Classic Games is a piece of history at a bargain price.", "date": "Jan 28, 2004"}
