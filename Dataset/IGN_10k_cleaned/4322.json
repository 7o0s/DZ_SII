And that's exactly what Ubisoft put together for Ubi Soft when it was commissioned for a game based upon the Kids WB cartoon Mucha Lucha. It's even more depressing to discover that Game Boy veteran Digital Eclipse was behind this one, as the studio has put out far better brawlers than this terrible, unresponsive game design. Features Three playable characters Unlockable special moves Cartridge save (four slots)  The game follows the tale of Buena Girl, Rikochet, and The Flea, masked Mexican wrestlers who attend the International School of Lucha. As the story goes, the Code of Masked Wrestling has been stolen from the Lucha School's office, so the higher-ups have sent these three mascaritas on the task to get it back by any means necessary...or be expelled. The task: simply punch and kick through an incredibly crappy action design with some of the most repetitive and unrewarding gameplay created for the Game Boy Advance. Mucha Lucha: Mascaritas of the Lost Code can't even be called a ~by the numbers~ brawler because it does so many things wrong in its design. Collision detection is incredibly wonky, and even when you're connecting with hits the enemy doesn't offer the necessary feedback that shows the character taking damage; some enemy sprites go into a pose that looks like they're in an indestructible blocking stance...but hammering down on the A button will eventually take the guy out regardless. Most Double Dragon-style games don't offer much in the way of strategy, at least the successful games encourage players to try new moves and techniques to get through the levels. But in Mucha Lucha, all of the enemies have similar behaviors no matter who they are, and boss battles are even more of a joke...the first bad guy can be defeated by simply running into him and pounding on the punch button until he no longer stands.  It's true that the game's look is based upon a cartoon that features an incredibly basic art direction, but the fact that this style has been carried over to the Game Boy Advance game makes the production look super low budget and rushed. Even the animation is incredibly chunky...even though the game promises fifteen moves for the three characters of the game, it's a wonder if they were talking about frames of animation for the entire production.  Oh, and even though the game offers three different wrestlers to control, only Rikochet is selectable from the beginning...the developers lock the other two characters until later in the game. Believe me when I say that this is not enough encouragement to play through the levels. The horribly redundant action is a turn-off right from the beginning.It's clear that this game was a rush-job right from the start. If there was any care in the design, the developers would have created a title that more matched what the cartoon revolves around: wrestling.The only thing I can really say positive about Mucha Lucha: Mascaritas of the Lost Code: At least Ubisoft fronted the tab for a cartridge save. The action is so awful that it's only swallowable in extremely short bursts, and having that save RAM means that players can turn this sucker off without remorse.", "date": "Dec 11, 2003"}
