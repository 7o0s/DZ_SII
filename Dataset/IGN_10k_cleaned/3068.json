After the disappointing Game Boy Advance renditions of NFL Blitz 20-03 (and NFL Blitz 20-02 before it),  it's a downright relief to see that the GBA version of its hockey series didn't suffer the same offensive fate. NHL Hitz 20-03 for the Nintendo handheld makes a good first attempt at recreating the over-the-top console franchise. It's a simple, pick-up game of hockey that doesn't promise anything more than it delivers. There aren't a whole lot of layers to the game's design, but it's definitely a fine foundation for a continuation next year. Features All NHL teams and key NHL players Exhibition and Season mode Cartridge Save Link cable support Only for Game Boy Advance  The NHL Hitz idea spawns from Midway's intensely-popular arcade-style sports franchises such as NBA Jam and NFL Blitz; give the gamers an intense experience by offering an abridged, exaggerated take on the sport in question. In the case of Hitz, only three players per team hit the ice (plus goalie), and all the penalties are lifted: no offsides, no icing, no high-sticking, no hooking, no cross-checking. Players just go out there on the rink and try to zing the puck past the goalie any way they can; slamming down the opponents is not only allowed, it's encouraged. Though if a player takes one too many beatings, their tempers may flair and the gloves might be thrown down.  The result is a hockey title that's a basic, fun game that harkens back to the days of the NES versions of Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel, but with the hockey strategies and control that are expected in videogame renditions of the sport. Players can do the standard pass-and-shoot thing, sure...but one-timers are there, as well as powerful slapshots that can zing past a slow-reacting goalie. Using the shoulder buttons, players can pull off a spin-move to avoid a check, or poke at the puck to try and safely steal it away from an opponent. Of course, the standard Midway-style Turbo meter enters play in this game, as well as the ~on-fire~ mode for when you pull off a hat trick or plaster your opponents enough time. Getting on fire gives your player enhanced abilities, and the odds of scoring with a player on fire are greatly improved.  And it's great to see Midway handing the Hitz design to a team that actually gets the whole concept of the Midway Sports theme, and it's a team that attempts to recreate the whole energetic presentation...right down to the front-end. The GBA version even features a nice array of speech samples from Tim Kitzrow, the man that's been doing Midway's sports commentary for years. The graphics aren't drop-dead gorgeous or anything, but they do a good job portraying the Hitz theme on the system.  The puck has a great flame trail during powerful shots, and players' reflections are accurately portrayed on the ice through a simple (but effective) sprite trick. On the flip side, the arena artwork is extremely bland...the fans are simply two color squares repeated over and over, and they don't even animate. The perspective's changed for the Game Boy Advance design: instead of the familiar top-down camera standard used in the console version, Exient went with the more old-school side-scrolling mode. The vertical mode would have made aiming shots a whole lot more intuitive, but there's nothing terribly wrong with portraying the game in its horizontal mode on the GBA...it just takes a bit to get used to.  That's pretty much all there is to NHL Hitz for the Game Boy Advance. The portable version doesn't include the extras from the console game. No create-a-player, no unlockable rinks (that we found, anyway), no mini-game training modes...nothing but the Season mode that's (thankfully) saved to the cartridge. At least the game supports the link cable; if you've got extra copies of the game, up to four players can link up and go at it on the ice. NHL Hitz 2003 on the Game Boy Advance is a decent arcade-style hockey game that just screams to be updated for next year. Exient's done a great job with the series on the handheld hardware, and with another round of development on the title, it's possible that the Game Boy Advance version of the series can match the console version in almost every way. Don't expect a perfect conversion of the franchise, but do expect a much better rendition of the Midway series than what the NFL Blitz team pooped out for the handheld.", "date": "Oct 16, 2002"}
