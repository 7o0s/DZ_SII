Most gamers recognize him from his appearance in the brilliant Fighters Megamix on the Saturn, but few know his true origin  the character starred in a 1991 action-RPG on the Japanese MegaDrive, appropriately entitled Rent-a-Hero. The game never came out in the States thanks to heavy amounts of Japanese culture-related jokes, and is considered a rare find even in Japan  I've seen it sell for as much as $200 at used game shops.  When Sega of Japan announced that they were working on a Dreamcast sequel/remake of Rent-a-Hero, the hardcores rejoiced  the company we so dearly love was finally giving props to its old-school fans. And it makes me very happy to state that Rent-a-Hero No. 1 is a bordering-on-cheesy, yet outstanding action-RPG that would make a solid addition to the US Dreamcast lineup. Rent-a-Hero No.1 follows the storyline behind the original Rent-a-Hero to a tee. You step into the shoes of Taro Yamada, an average teenager living in a bizarre hybrid of 1990s suburbia and Japanese culture. The game starts out with little fanfare  you're simply schmoozing around a block party thrown by your big-hearted father. Mom tells you that the cooking is running behind schedule, and asks you to call for take-out. The pizza arrives  along with an extra present, a box containing a superhero outfit. Mom grabs the pizzas, and you change into the costume.  Meanwhile, your father has dressed up in a Godzilla outfit from last year's costume party, and is playfully harassing the guests. Dear ol' Dad spots you in your superhero outfit, and challenges you to a fight. You throw a light punch, which is unintentionally amplified several thousand times by the power of the Rent-a-Hero costume! This nearly kills your father, who is sent flying against the wall. The rest of the family gathers around you, and Mom gives you a stern verbal reaming while you hang your head in shame. Then the Rent-a-Hero theme music starts blasting, the intro plays, and you know you're in for fun, bro. Rent-a-Hero No. 1 is an action-RPG, with a big emphasis on fighting and exploration. The concept  is admittedly pretty bizarre  you assume the role of a part-time superhero, who works for a mysterious company called SECA. Aside from creating the Rent-a-Hero armor, SECA also provides you with a ~Creamcast~  a set-top console that lets you receive e-mail, and find high-paying superhero jobs.  Or that's the theory, anyway  the first handful of missions are pretty pathetic, as your mighty super-self is reduced to passing out pamphlets on street corners, or delivering love letters to teen sweethearts. During these quests, you learn the ropes of being a superhero, and become aware of your limitations. The Rent-a-Hero outfit is powered by Sanyo AA batteries, available for purchase at the local convenience store  run out of energy, and you'll transform back into the comparatively weak Taro.  Fortunately, it's not all drudgework for our would-be superhero  the fists eventually start flying, and the combat takes shape in a form not unlike AM2's Spikeout. Fighting is entirely in 3D, and you can freely run through the battle areas, including parks, streets, and other urban locations. At first, combat feels a little stiff  that's because you learn moves from other characters, in Shen Mue style. For example, in your first mission, you hand a pamphlet out to the resident Karate master (who bears more than a passing resemblance to the high-kicking Saturn mascot, Segata Sanshiro). The master makes fun of your outfit, and invites you into his gym for an ass-beating. After busting him up, he acknowledges your superiority and shows you how to do a double front-kick. Cool stuff!  Of course, the game is not about just rescuing kittens out of trees and uniting teenage sweethearts, as you'll eventually be introduced to the nefarious Dr. Trouble (who, I imagine, wishes to hold the world hostage for One! Million! Dollars!). As you complete various missions, new gameplay areas are opened up, totaling around five large neighborhoods, each with plenty of houses, universities, and restaurants. Those who take the time to poke around will be rewarded, too  for example, if you go into the video arcade, you can walk up to one of the machines and download a mini-game into your VMU. (Examining all of the arcade games  all made by Sega, of course  results in their theme songs playing.)  Accompanying the meticulous attention to detail are brilliantly rendered graphics. The game is presented from a quasi-overhead 3D perspective, which automatically switches to accommodate the best view (though I would have appreciated a way to manually control the camera, which is strangely absent). This game is hard-core texture intensive, and the usage of color is brilliant  check it out on a VGA monitor or through an S-video connection, and you'll be able to read the text on your character's T-shirt. Best of all, the game runs at 60fps. And we're not talking wobbly, quasi-60fps-except-when-there-are-multiple-characters-on-screen  it's locked at that frame rate, and doesn't hiccup.  The game's animation is another one of its strong suits, and is remarkably fluid. The sight of Rent-a-Hero  dashing through the streets at top speed while trailing a case of ramen behind him is worth the price of admission alone  as are the half-dozen manly poses you strike before turning into your superhero alter ego. Some of the fighting moves seem to have been ~borrowed~ from Virtua Fighter 3 and Spike Out, so the battle sequences move pretty well.  But the game's best feature is its sense of humor. Unlike other games that try to be ~funny~ and fall flat on their faces, Rent-a-Hero No. 1 always hits the punch line at the right time, and provides more gags and Sega in-jokes than our daily Q&A section. The only downside is that the jokes have to be either visual sight gags or read; Rent-a-Hero No. 1 was made on a limited budget, and that budget didn't include voice acting. I can only imagine a version of this game with some of Japan's finest voice actors delivering the dialogue.  As it stands, Rent-a-Hero is not a particularly importer-friendly game; though the fighting is enjoyable to all, the majority of the game's cues come from written Japanese, and I'd imagine that trial-and-error puzzle-solving guesswork would be extremely tedious in an open-ended game like this. I'm also unsure as to whether or not this game will make it to the States  despite the game's predominantly American look and feel, there's a ton to translate, and a lot of the jokes would have to be modified for English-speaking audiences to figure out what in the hell was going on.   A lot of people have been calling Rent-a-Hero No. 1 a ~B-Movie~ game  it certainly fits the bill, with its limited budgeting and over-the-top campy subject matter. In any case, the gameplay is tightly focused, it looks great, and definitely has a soul  something that's been missing in a lot of games these days. If you're fluent in Japanese and need some cheap laughs combined with honest-to-God fun gameplay, you could do a lot worse things than picking this one up. -- Colin ~Rent-a-Freelancer~ Williamson, IGN", "date": "Jun 1, 2000"}
