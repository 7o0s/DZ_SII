Any game that starts with a frantic bra hunt certainly puts its best foot forward -- and Grey's Anatomy certainly benefits from a strong opener that successfully hooks you into this mix of soap opera drama and Trauma Center-style game mechanics.   After the bra safari, you head to Seattle Grace Hospital, the focal point of the hit television series. Here, you slip into the scrubs of Meredith gray and must survive the hectic day-in/day-out life of a doctor. The game keeps up the cheekiness, but quickly injects the drama with plenty of operations and mini-games. You walk around the hospital (actually, you occasionally run too -- which is one of the mini-games) and check in on patients, consult with other doctors, and just observe. In this way, Grey's Anatomy has a touch of open-world gameplay that I really like seeing.   However, when trouble pops up, you must rush to the OR and wield that scalpel. Here's where I got that trauma Center vibe, which is hardly an insult since that series is favorite of mine on the DS and Wii. You assist with a variety of operations, performing tasks like cutting patients open, suturing wounds, extracting tissue, etc. You must always keep your eyes on the patient's vitals. The game uses meters are whatnot to reduce these situations to easily consumed mini-games. As you progress, you get tougher operations and more tools. Since Grey is on her way to being a top doctor, you soon find yourself in the driver's seat on these operations.   Fans of the show will undoubtedly enjoy conversing with recognizable cast members and reading smart, clever dialogue. Apparently, the game touches on quite a bit of material from the actual show. Since I am admittedly not a watcher, this was all fresh to me.   It's rare for a Gameloft game not to look great -- and Grey's Anatomy certainly bolsters the mobile maker's track record. The hospital is exquisitely detailed. The character sprites are recognizable even in their smallest forms. The meters for mini-games are clear and easy to read. The entire game benefits from a great attention to detail that few other mobile publishers really adhere to.  Grey's Anatomy is a great game for fans of the show. But even if you don't check in on these hot docs every week, there is still plenty to recommend here. The open-world hospital offers good pacing, the mini-games are fun, and the operation stuff is new to mobile. I enjoyed it and I think you will, too.", "date": "Feb 26, 2008"}
