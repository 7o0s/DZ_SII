Thanks to games such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Tomb Raider and Soul Reaver, 3D adventure games place just as much emphasis on action and platforming as exploration and discovery.   What happened to the days of Sam and Max and Monkey Island? I honestly don't know. One thing I do know is that a 3D adventure game must, in some manner, deliver good puzzles, a story-driven game, and a unique form of action to make the masses happy. Believe it or not, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb offers players a good dose of all these, and despite its problems, it's a good, solid adventure game.     Despite what the previous IGN editors who've played it have said, I have to disagree with them about the outcome. Perhaps it's because I haven't ever played an Indiana Jones game before (What? How could I?!!!), or it's because I just finished playing the troubled Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, but my time spent playing Indiana Jones was a pleasurable one. It's a tad too simple at times, there is a laundry list of things to complain about, but in the end, I felt like I was Indy, a smart-ass adventurer getting into trouble all across the world. For me, it was a fresh new experience, and it worked just fine.   Gameplay  Originally delivered on the PC and Xbox prior to arriving on PlayStation 2, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is a 3D action-adventure game based on an original story in Lucas' Indiana Jones universe. Players step into the spelunking boots of the notoriously risky explorer and archeologist, Jones, and follow a suspicious duo of commissioners through the exotic locations of Ceylon, Istanbul and Hong Kong. Jones is after a handful of artifacts that, when combined, hold a power far beyond the reaches of the imagination. Naturally, since the game takes place in 1935, the Nazi Albrecht Von Beck is also after the idols, and just like in the movies, he instantly appears after you've acquired them.

Get The Guide   Comprising a healthy balance of action (with a surprising emphasis on combat) and puzzles, players start the first mission, a seamless training session that quickly transforms into a deeper adventure, and within an hour or two you're up against the first boss. Created with a third-person perspective and using mostly intuitive controls, players have a solid set of commands: Indy can walk, run, shimmy, swim, hang, climb, jump, fight, fire weapons, use his whip in cool ways and more. He's also got a nice wall sneak that works beautifully around corners and high, dangerous places.   The action is, compared to say the most recent adventure game on the PS2, Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, is incredible. But that says more about Tomb Raider than it does The Emperor's Tomb. With all of my senses running, I'd say the action is Indy is pretty good. The level of actions is large and likeable and Indy can do things like block attacks, roll and get out of trouble relatively easily. Indy picks up weapons and ammo in hidden places, and they're never too hard to find; the weapons range from simple Lugers to healthy handguns to various types of progressively powerful machine guns.    Each time Indy needs to pull a lever, use the whip or interact in any way, a simplistic icon appears on screen to show players what to do. This is perhaps too simplistic a method, but it beats searching for things of this nature. On the other hand, The Collective could have slowly weened players off this iconic method or it could have made the interactive parts a little more obvious. The current method leads players with too much pampering. I mean, really, I know what a giant lever in the middle of a room will do!    Using the shoulder buttons, players can toggle from any of the items in the inventory, from water to health packs to guns, idols, or his trusty whip, and all of it is done in realtime. So, if you're away from trouble, it's easy, and while you're in combat, it's a little more troublesome. Aiming is automatic when Indy is not moving, which helps keep the action focused, though when he's mobile the auto-targeting is freed up.    Yeah, that's it, use you knife against that ghost. Yeah, that' the ticket. The shooting aspect of shooting is a little suspect, and the reasons are at least two-fold. First, Lucas never liked the idea of Indy shooting anything in the movies; he preferred no guns at all. So, the whole notion of Indiana Jones running around with a high-powered rifle or machine gun seems a little at odds with the original notion. Second, the AI is all messed up. It's not too hard, and it reacts relatively well to any circumstance, but any one of the thugs in this game can withstand at least four to five shots of nearly any weapon in the head, leg, body, or what-have-you. With the exception of the pistol and the heavy machine gun, the AI takes equal punishment if you whip it eight times or if you shoot it in the face four times. Strange, isn't it? You'd think after one shot to the face, an enemy would kindawell, die a horrible death. Not here. They wipe the dust off and put up their dukes. Come on!    Third, the whip is a fabulous, all-purpose weapon. It's usable to swing from high ledge to risky cliff throughout the game, and it's, quite frankly, one of the coolest things about this title. By whipping an enemy in the head, players can knock his hat off, or they knock his weapon from his hand. And if they hit and hold X, they can grab the enemy and pull him toward him in a combo uppercut. Sweet stuff. The animations are excellent, the quickness and effectiveness are solid, and it's just fun as hell. Makes me feel like I'm Indiana Jones. But man! In order to kill any of these baddies in the long run, the whip kinda sucks. A player must honestly whip an enemy like 10 times before he finally croaks. If you're in a group situation, the whip is relatively useless. So, we return to the gun thing.    Fourth, the fighting system is quite robust. Indy can perform all sorts of attacks, from headbutts, combos, uppercuts and throws. Good stuff, really, and what's more, they're all pulled off with simple one and two button combos, which is great for an adventure game. I don't think I looked at the manual more than once, and so I could just picked up the moves while playing. But again, when the fisticuffs are just as powerful as the Luger or the machine gun shots, things are more than screwy.      The action seems to fit in between puzzles and it comes in various sizes and shapes. There are your standard German and Czech thugs, rogue punks, and every so often an animal or two comes your way. The first two bosses, a monstrous white alligator and a Frankenstein-like mega-monster are pretty good bosses. In order to beat each one players must solve various puzzles or use the environment to defeat him, while also fighting the enemy (in some cases). They're a little cheap around the edges, but I rarely find a game without a cheap boss: it's part of the nature of bosses.     Puzzle solving starts off quite easy. Indy wanders around, hitting a switch here, opening a door there, and generally, the first half of the game is relatively simplistic (even for IGNPC editors). The first interesting puzzle appears in Prague, where Indy must find items and present them to a horned, robed death god, which appears from a blazing fire. With each new item acquired, Indy then gets the chance to solve another puzzle, and open another door. The puzzles mix numerology, astrological signs and a clock for a good set of four interrelated solutions. The rest never require too much brainpower or get much harder than that, and they're never in the league of Silent Hill, Zelda or Ico.    The physical puzzles, i.e. getting from the ground level of the Castle to the telescope tower, are more interesting. Players need to climb and swing on ropes placed 20-stories high, daringly swing through stained-glass windows into enemy hands, and maneuver through some cleverly organized levels. In this regard, Indy truly shines.    Graphics  What hampers The Emperor's Tomb the most, however, is a combination of sloppiness in the visuals, AI, and in the overall polish. Technically, it's a mess. I have already lengthily discussed the AI's weaknesses so I won't bother repeating myself. The graphics I'll get to in more detail, but at least with regard to the game's functions, the framerate ranges anywhere from low and slow to just plain crummy. And while some animations are performed quickly, others look slow, chunky and ugly. There is little subtlety to this game. The game looks like a bad port, and compared to the other versions, it's easily the least graphically impressive.    The other problems range from a constant blurriness, to shimmering and aliasing to the horrible collision detection to an incredible feeling of a rushed, unfinished product. Was this game rushed? Or were things simply over-looked? It's hard to tell, but the property, and a game with this much potential, deserves better. It's a good to great game that could have easily been saved with more attention to the little things. It seems that either the LucasArts executive staff should probably listen to its testers better, or that The Collective should have implemented and corrected the glitchy little things with more skill. Either way, in 2003, it's a shame that The Emperor's Tomb should look this unkempt and unpolished.     Some of the game's best qualities, such as its wide range of textures, some decent animations, and the level of interactivity, are noticeable, but they're outweighed by the surplus of negatives.    Weeee-- Indy jumps a train. Classic Indy move. Sound  What makes The Emperor's Tomb so genuine, and certainly what compelled me with such force, is the interactive and movie-based soundtrack. The music changes depending on the action, and so like a lot of games, if Indy is quietly creeping around, the orchestration lowers in volume and tempo, picking up again during cutscenes or quickening during fight scenes. It's dramatic, fully fleshed out cinematic-quality music. For those who loved the first movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, John Williams' ~The Raiders March~ plays a big role in the game's sound. Too bad there is no support for Dolby of any kind, be it Pro Logic II or even Dolby Surround Sound.    While others may argue this, Indy's voice acting (performed by David Esch) is close enough to Harrison Ford's that it does the trick. His dialog/narrative pipes in every so often with wise-crack remarks to put the finishing touches on the well-known character. The rest of the cast also performs well enough, though none are as well known as Indiana Jones. Actually, the AI does quite a bit of talking while Indy is lurking in the shadows. And it's nowhere nearly as funny as say, No Ones Lives Forever, but, the silly quips occasionally do raise a smile.   To be honest, I haven't ever played any Indiana Jones games before, so I came to this one fresh and, well, uninhibited. So, maybe that's why I enjoyed the game so much despite its flaws. After all, I don't have any better Indiana Jones games to compare it to. And, after having slogged through the mire that is Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, this adventure is a welcome relief. The whip is classic, and if there is a new Indiana Jones game, it should capitalize even more on the complexities of this unique Indy weapon. The puzzles are a little on the simplistic side, but they do work well in the scheme of things, never seeming out of place, and the action is good, but it's also all over the damn place. The AI is wacked. And it's too bad that the PS2 version looks so cruddy and feels so unfinished and unpolished. The great soundtrack is also held back by no Dolby support of ny kind. Shame, shame. In the end, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb is far from the best action-adventure on the PS2. But it's far better than Core's latest effort, even with its problems, especially in the control, action and fun sectors. I'd only get this if I were desperately in need of a new adventure game (any adventure game), or a ridiculous Indy fan. Or, if I'd never played an Indiana Jones game before, I'd get it but on another system. Otherwise, rent this first, and prepare to be mildly unimpressed.", "date": "Jul 2, 2003"}
