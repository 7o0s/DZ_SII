{"name": "Bass Landing", "name_review": "Bass Landing", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/17/bass-landing", "text": "Bass Landing is Agetec's offering into the overcrowded and seemingly popular fishing genre. Lately, there's been a huge flood of fishing games on the market. Just in the past year or so, titles such as Bass Rise, Reel Fishing, Black Bass with Blue Marlin, and a number of other fishing games have been released on the console.   Most of the fishing games haven't really had much that set them apart from the competition and have basically been mediocre games. However, Bass Landing appears to be the exception, as it has a wealth of features and offers new gameplay experiences that helps set it apart from the opposition.   Gameplay Bass Landing is operable with the old Sony controller and the dual shock, but it works best with Agetec's own fishing controller (which can be purchased with the game in one package). With the regular controller, an easy to use meter is used for casting and the reeling in is handled with simple button presses. With the fishing controller, casts are executed by performing a casting motion with the controller, and the player reels in the fish with the reel mechanism on the controller. It's just like real fishing.   Simulating real life fishing is really what this game is all about. There are more options available in this game than any other on the market. The game offers several different casting techniques: Overhead Cast, Sidehand Cast, Pitching and Skipping Cast. Mastering each cast is very important, as they'll each prove to be vital in your success in catching Bass.   There are also countless other options and skills that will help in determining your success in landing some Bass. There are two different reel types offered (spinning and lure rods) and a large number of different lures that are varied in their effectiveness. For instance, lures will perform different based on the depth of the water the player is fishing in and will offer different advantages based on the strength of the line being used.   Players are also given complete control over the fishing experience. Not only can the player choose the type of cast, but he or she is able to change the degrees of the drag up to five different levels. And, instead of simply having a few different spot available to fish in on a lake, players are able to drive around a boat and choose exactly which area on the lake to fish in. This greatly enhances the realism of the game, as well as the skill needed to be successful.   Adding to the game's realism, the action takes place from a 3rd person view behind the fisherman. The player doesn't get some underwater view that allows him or her to see the fish and reel in based on where the fish are located. Instead, the player must know where's the best place to try and catch fish by the viewable environment and the environment that is shown by the Depth Finder and GPS systems that he or she's equipped with.   The realistic fishing, combined with the numerous lakes that are fully customizable and the tournament play modes, Bass Landing is a true-to-life fishing simulation that manages to be fun and exciting to play.   Graphics Bass Landing makes use of a fully 3D environment that allows the player to go anywhere on the various lakes. The backgrounds are varied and include some really nice scenery, many of which will help determine the best places to try and catch fish. But, on the downside, the graphics are pretty grainy and there's a substantial amount of pop-up.   Sound The sound effects are realistic and help set a nice fishing mood. It's full of nice reeling noises, the noise of the boat's engine and other ambient sound effects. But, the game's music soundtrack is awful. The cheesy music is not only poorly done, but it actually detracts from the entire experience.  With reviews of Bass Rise and now Bass Landing under my belt, pretty soon I'll be able to call myself the FISHING MASTER. In total, I've played around with about four different fishing games on the PlayStation and must say that Bass Landing is undeniably the best currently available on the system. It's actually a very challenging game, but that proved to be one of the great parts about it. Because of the challenge, I felt much more rewarded when I actually caught a fish. If you're looking to buy a fishing game for your PlayStation, I'd suggest picking up Bass Landing packaged with the fishing controller.", "date": "Dec 17, 1999"}
