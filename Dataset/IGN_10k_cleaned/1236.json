I mean seriously, where else but in Japan would a company have the chutzpah to give their product such a freakish sounding moniker? (And hey! New Jersey doesn't count!) A much more interesting title than the name would lead you to believe, V-Chronicle has quickly managed to shoot itself to the top of my favorite imports list.  Thought to be perhaps a dating simulation for fanged bat-people among the uninitiated, Vampire Chronicle is actually one of the best fighting games available for Dreamcast yet. Dubbed the ~Matching Service~ because of it's ability to allow players to battle over the Internet via a specialized finder program, this is one Capcom production that many of us (including a few of my colleagues) have been looking forward too for quite some time.  Standing tall as the most definitive collection of Vampire games (known as Darkstalkers in the West) to ever be released, Chronicle is a 2D maniac's sploshy wet dream. Fusing together both the engines and characters of the original Vampire and its sequels (Vampire Hunter, Savior, and Savior 2), this Dreamcast compilation is certainly a sight to behold. Ported over from their arcade counterparts to the last bit of code, you have never seen the series look this faithful on a home system before!  Missing frames of animation, misplaced win poses, and the toned-down moves we've all grown accustomed too are now a thing of the past. And as the previously mighty standard by which all Vampire games were to be judged, (the import Saturn version of V-Savior) bows in comparison to its Dreamcast brother, the illusion of playing the arcade cabinet at home has just been increased by twenty (And without the need for a clunky 4 Megabyte upgrade cartridge at that!). In short, VC is looking good.  So good in fact, that you may pop the disc in every now and then just to peruse the scenery! The most colorful and atmospheric 2D fighter in history, the Darkstalkers games have always been great for personality. Borrowing their character designs from classic movie monsters and the chronically inspired Capcom art team, I would often times just stand there and watch people play... soaking in all of that flat-celled goodness.  Granted the level of detail and fluidity of the animation isn't quite as smooth as the more recent examples of Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Street Fighter III, but what the game lacks in technical brilliance it makes up for in good old fashioned coolness factor. Taunts, win poses, and background activity are a major highlight, and the monster-types and costumes these fighters present are outrageous! Besides, can you think of any other game where a bee-woman can scrap toe-to-toe with a Frankenstein's Monster? Yeah, me either.  While we're on the subject of characters, let me just say that they're fantastic. Boasting the entire rogues gallery from every Darkstalkers game ever (including Oboro Bishamon, Shadow, Jedah, and Marionette), your choice of alter-egos is a large one. Vampires, werewolves, mummies, succubae, and all sorts of odd-radish critters in-between make a larger than life appearance. Complete with their own specialized theme songs and decked out ultra-stages (Victor's rocks!), I can easily go on record to say that this fighter has one of the best rosters the genre has seen!  Before I go any further, I should clear up a little quarrel I have with the gameplay early on. That is more accurately, with its lack of modes. As unfortunately, unlike most of today's fighting games, Vampire Chronicle only has two forms of play; Arcade and Training (all right three, if you want to count the options as another form. But if we do that we might as well notch turning on the power switch as a fourth). And though the arcade mode can be played for hours and hours without looking back, the training option is a little on the thin side (can it actually qualify as ~training~ if it doesn't show you how to do any moves?). Time trials, tournament setups, and perhaps an involved story line mode would have made the game seem more like a complete package. Admittedly, the absence of such a list of options left me with a bit of a stomach ache.  If you can overlook those shortcomings and get into the game itself however, you're in for a real treat. Borrowing elements from just about every Street Fighter game in existence, the Darkstalkers engine is almost infallible. Though if you're expecting to jump right in and play the original game all over again, it doesn't quite work that way. Yes, this game is quite different indeed.  You see, instead of acting as a hub that allows you to play retreads of every Stalkers game before it, V-Chronicle takes a unique approach to revisiting history. Instead of just picking your game and jumping into it (ala the Street Fighter Collections), you are treated to just one main game. Once you've pressed start and are on your way, you are then prompted to choose one of three versions of that game. Vampire, Hunter, and Savior selections are the choices you are allowed to make, and each reflect the style of play found in those games. Kind of cool isn't it?  Now if you're unfamiliar with the differences between the styles, it's really quite simple. Vampire plays almost exactly like Super Street Fighter II Turbo, and runs off the same fundamentals. Super attacks however, can only be charged one at a time, and to use them all you have to do is perform a special attack with a full technique bar. Viola... instant super!  The Hunter-style plays a bit differently. As now your Super bar can be continuously charged by blocking and making attacks, while your Super moves themselves can generally land for a greater quantity of hits. Now using all three kick or punch buttons to bang out those spectacular finishers, the amount of finger twisting and combo-busting is also lengthened (and more user-friendly too).  The final style of play is the way of the Savior. Essentially the same as Hunter style, the only real differences are that the health bars now carry over from round to round and your win marker is a bat instead of an orb. Other little nuances (like a slightly enhanced soundtrack when in this mode), keep Savior as the choice of champions. Including this one's!  But wait! There's more! Once you've selected your game-style, it's off to choose your fighting style next! This time with four selections, you can pick the Vampire, Hunter, Savior, and Savior 2 forms of fighting. Basically a ladder of increased moves and slightly altered technique patterns, this is where players can basically customize their fighter to the game they're most accustomed too. You can even go backwards and give newer characters like Bulleta and Lilith the original Vampire style! It may sound a bit complicated here, but once you pop that disc in, it's second nature. Vampire Chronicle truly shines with two players at the helm. Great fun alone, but insane madman-action with a group, the no-juggle, guard-canceling monster-fest is a tribute to old-school beating we used to dish out to each other as kids. What truly stands out is how well Capcom managed to include certain elements from their other fighters to create the true feeling of a difference between the gruesome competitors (For instance, wouldn't Donovan have made a great guest star in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?, or how about that pre-Alpha 3 foreshadowing in the form of Gallon's Custom-combo Super?). Outstanding!  One of the rarest of game types, Vampire Chronicle successfully manages to take a lot of the old and mix it with a dash of the new for a wildly successful formula. Although we gaijin folk won't be able to play online with our buds in Japan, and the game's variety in modes leave something to be desired, it can't take away from the fact that this is an awesome 2D experience. Difficult to find even in the land of the Rising Sun (only 5000 copies were pressed, and they could only be ordered online directly from Sega), tracking down one of these beasties is going to be a task that proves harder than any final boss. So start hitting those trade mags, auction houses, and importers, and get this one while you can... you won't regret it!  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Sep 13, 2000"}
