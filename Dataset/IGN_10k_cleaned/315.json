{"name": "WCW Mayhem", "name_review": "WCW Mayhem", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/15/wcw-mayhem-3", "text": "A new player has entered into the bizarre landscape of wrestling and it's none other than mother of the franchise concept, the biggest software maker in the business, Electronic Arts. With WCW Mayhem, the company set out to beat out all of the other games of its kind with several weapons. Back when the game was first announced, the producers of the game promised Mayhem would be faster, with better collision detection, more storyline and backstage factions feuding it out, and an easy-to-use fighting system that would beat out everything else on the planet.   I'm here to tell you that EA got most of it right, but it also missed the boat in several areas, too. WCW Mayhem is a good game, an especially good first attempt, and a contender in several ways where Acclaim's and THQ's games are weak. (As with any critical commentary on just about any wrestling game, I am fully prepared to take a beating, so bring it on!). Overall, Mayhem it's a mixed bag. Depending on the gamer, it may please or frustrate. Will you like it? Read on.  Gameplay First, EA delivered on almost all of its promises. When EA first announced the details of WCW Mayhem, it made a big point of where other wrestling games were weak and how EA would mow down the competition. OK, it didn't say ~mow,~ but that was the expectation. Thankfully, Mayhem did deliver in several areas, the first being wrestler speed.   Every wrestler in WCW Mayhem is quick and responsive. The characters don't lag after a button is pressed, and the moves, animations, grapples, throws, and rope usage are all exceptionally fast. For a person who has played far too may fighting and wrestling games, it's nice to see a faster moving wrestling game, especially when so many of them are still so slow. WCW Mayhem still isn't as fast as most fighting games, but it's much closer than any other game in the lineup. Really.   Second, EA's first effort did pay off in several areas. One of them is a mixed bag, and that's the motion capture aspect of the game. About 80% of the time, the wrestlers move with an amazingly accurate replication of the superstars on TV. Better yet, the speed of the wrestlers is not hampered, rather the opposite, by the motion capture process, which EA spent a lot of money and time on. When Sting or Goldberg lifts up an opponent in a suplex, it looks damn real. When they stumble back from an elbow or a punch, they animation is totally authentic...I mean, just like on TV. (I didn't say fake now did I? No! So back off, eh?)  Wrestling System Third, I will argue this point with anyone (and I guess I'll be doing it for sometime to come), the fighting system for WCW Mayhem is great. For the first time in I don't remember how long (if ever), we get an easy-to-pick-up game that doesn't require Killer Instinct-style button memorization that hampers gameplay. Players can pick up Mayhem, select The Man, Goldberg, and start thumping the crap out of every single opponent with all of Goldberg's big-time moves, The Spear, the Jackhammer, and the Gorilla Press. But, it's not like you can do that with only Goldberg, you can select any wrestler and perform all of their major moves without a master's degree in wrestling. This game enables you to play out the coolest parts of wrestling without having to be a rocket scientist or even a hard-core gamer. And being a hard-core gamer, I can definitely see the advantages to this simple but not simplistic control scheme.   Fourth, Mayhem extends the out of ring to play to new proportions. Every single game out there, or nearly every other game, enables players to climb out of the ring and hammer it out on the floor. And that's it. As promised, Mayhem goes the next step. Players can climb out of the ring, walk onto the intro stage and then walk right out of the arena for backstage battles. How cool is that? It rocks. Players can walk into 12 different areas to fight in and all of the ones I played in had weapons to add to the fun.   Wrestlers each have their own trademark moves, but share several core moves, which players can see over and over again, a technique used in most of the wrestler games I've played. One problem that wasn't solved in ~another~ wrestling game -- but is solved here -- is the two-on-one dilemma. Against a computer controlled opponent when a second character comes to help, players generally only face the first, or closest, wrestler. In Mayhem, not only is the game programmed to face the closest character, the L2 button enables players to change their attack their focus onto another character. I can't tell you how many times I've been creamed because of this problem in other wrestlers, and I'm glad to see EA solved it.   As for match times, this one is mixed. In ~real~ WCW wrestling, many matches are long and slow as hell. Some of the matches in Mayhem are long, too. One of the reasons is because of the Momentum Meter, which quickly turns on the lead players. You may have all of the momentum of a 5-ton freight truck, but in an instant, it's all gone due to a single hit or stun. That certainly makes for a fun, even match in most cases, but man, if I'm clobbering my opponent and he gets in a single hit, all of my work is for naught. Honestly, I'm not a big fan of that. If I'm doing the work beating the crap out of the other wrestler, I should be rewarded. I should be able to pin his @ss. Logically, it takes a really long time to pin the other opponent, too. It's not quite clear why, but in the next Mayhem, I'd like to see these areas improved.   Players can wrestler in a few different modes in Mayhem, but not as many as I'd have liked to see. There's is Quick Start, the Main Event, Quest for the Best, Pay Per View Password, and a minimal option section called Global Option. In Main Event you'll find the bulk of the fun, with choices of match type (singles, handicap, triangle, four-way dance, battle royale, and tag-team), plus match length, and the event kind, which is quite large, and includes Monday Nitro, Thursday Thunder, Saturday Night, Souled Out, SuperBrawl, Uncencored, Spring Stampede, Slamboree, Great American Bash, Bash at the Beach, Road Wild, Fall Brawl, Halloween Havoc, World War III, and Starrcade. Gamers also have a choice of difficulty level (practice, easy, medium, and hard), and they can change the rules around a bit, too.   And finally, there are more than 50 wrestling superstars in the game, from Goldberg, Sting, Diamond Dallas Page Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Booker T, Horace, Stevie Ray, Scott Norton, Scott Steiner, Kevin Nash, Lex Luger, Disco Inferno, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Steve McMichael, Rey Mysterio, Jr, Kidman, Eddy Guerrero, Juventud Guerrera, Raven, Saturn, Kanyon, and more.  Create a Player  You know, just a year ago, the idea of a Create-a-Player mode was totally new. In a very short period, Acclaim has done a fantastic job of fleshing out a brilliant Create-A-Player mode. Unfortunately, EA's Mayhem doesn't come close to it, not a good thing. But on the other hand, WCW Mayhem's Create-A-Player mode is not shabby. Compared to WWF Warzone, Acclaim's first WWF wrestling game, it's pretty damn good, and it's only EA's first attempt, so it shouldn't been disregarded.   Having said that, I must say Mayhem's Create-a-Player mode is also frustrating. First, it's nowhere as deep as Acclaim's, and in typical EA fashion, the Create-A-Player actually has its very own loading times! What the #$%^?? How can a static screen with no actual movement require a three second long time loading time? Hasn't EA been in the business for ages, and hasn't it figured out how to beat that loading bug? Apparently not. Other than that, the Create-A-Players selection list is pretty good. Here's what you can do to create your own wrestler:  Create A Player Selections:   Name: Select a name  Appearance You can choose from size, template, skin type, face, hair style, hair color, facial hair, mask, sunglasses, head piercings, neck tattoo, head wear, shirt, shirt logo, shirt hem, sleeve length, jacket, necktie, chains, body piercing, front tattoo, back tattoo, arm bands, elbow pads, hand tie, gloves, arm tattoo, arm misc, pants, pant pattern, pant length, knee hole, belt, rear-end logo, leg tattoo, kneepad, boots.  Personality  Faction, style, attitude, intro music Abilities  strength, impact, speed, quickness, aerial, mat ability, submission, brawling, dirtiness Graphics Once again, EA delivers a mixed final product here. The crowd is like a carpet of non-moving, faceless shapes, which sucks. However, like I said earlier, the motion captured characters move incredibly well. They're fast and are frosted with lots of Gourard, flat and other textures, ensuring detailed looks, but not terribly over-burdened, slow duds. What's really weird is what happened in the motion capture process. Like a weird set of Frankenstein monster wrestlers, every single wrestler in Mayhem looks like a large dwarf. Dwarfs are fine when they're supposed to like dwarfs. But these guys are big; they're the farthest thing from dwarfs. Each character looks somehow scrunched in to a smaller form than they normally wouldn't fit into. It's a weird one, folks. Characters have fat, short necks, and look like they're all missing about two three vertebrae. You've got to see it to believe it, but these guys look just slightly off. It's really unnerving. It is worth looking at -- sober -- that is.   Other than the good looking dwarven characters, and the flat backgrounds, EA has a few other problems. As with every other wrestling game on the planet, Mayhem has awful collision detection. What is that? It's when a wrestler puts his hand through the opponent's head, chest, or arms with out even blinking or without pain or consequences. Apparently no single developer can figure out how to solve this problem, and EA, which said it would way back in the day, can't solve it either.   And then there is the big-@ss rope problem. These ropes seem to have missed the collision detection Q&A department, too. When was the last time you put your hand through a rope? Well, in WCW Mayhem, it's in every game, baby! Along with that there are seams in quite a bit of the game, and 15-20 second load times that are, as usual, annoying and irksome.   However, having laid in pretty thick with the graphic problems of the game, EA pulled off a couple of cool diddies. During certain pins and drops, the camera angles change to heighten the moved being pulled off. Needless to say, these are great. Drop your friend to the mat, and watch as the camera circles around, the crowd roars, and the momentum shifts your way. It's delightful and an effect that other publisher should take note of.  Sound As each new wrestler game gets better and better, building off the rising level of competition, each area of the game gets better in one way or the other. In Mayhem, the sound is absolutely great. From the two-man commentators to the sound of your opponent having his face slammed into the mat, every aspect of the sound is great. To top it off, the crowd is one of the best ones I've ever heard in a wrestling game. This crowd is loud, and blankets you with wave after wave of praise or condemnation depending on your momentum. EA has something good on its hands. WCW Mayhem is better then decent, and it has a lot of good qualities that other wrestling games don't address, such as fast moving characters, different camera angles, great sound, and lots of our of ring experiences.On the other hand, some of the problems may make a lot of players a little heated. Sure, we're picky but we play a lot of games, including a lot of wrestling games. I expect that next year's rendition should be much better, and hopefully it will include the storylines, changing factions, and other soap-opera like qualities that make wrestling such a...~unique~ experience.
