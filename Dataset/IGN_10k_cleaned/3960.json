The word's been used to emphasize ~multiplayer fun,~ but as many titles that have adopted the Party moniker have shown, just because it used the word doesn't mean it's actually going be enjoyable. Disney's Party for the Game Boy Advance is an extremely rushed and sloppy game for kids that barely brings any enjoyment to the table, half-assedly splattering unrelated gaming elements into a board game design that's just incredibly redundant and unexciting to play. Features Four boards Four players on one system Link cable support for four players in three mini-games (single cartridge support) Cartridge save (one slot)  So Uncle Scrooge actually used some of his dough to create an amusement part for his friends. But upon its grand opening, the evil Dr. Nickel has taken over the power systems and scattered the ~magical power~ all over the different sections of the park. To get the park up to tiptop shape, Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy will have to wander the different locations and recover the ~magical power~ to get the park open for business again. The story is about as loosely constructed as the rest of the game, but thankfully players can simply hold down the Start button to rush through the incredible amount of text that's spit at them. Disney's Party main mode is its board game, a design that relies almost entirely on the luck of the roll with a set of dice. That wouldn't be so bad if there was actually interesting things to do during this game, but as it is, players simply roll the dice, move that many spaces on the board, collect or lose the reward that's designated to that spot, and hand the turn over to the next person. The player who manages to get to the specific location selected on the board at the of the round will have the opportunity win extra points by unlocking playing some of the clumsiest platform challenges ever made on the GBA...but we'll get back to that in a second. To successfully win the board game, players have to land on blue spaces to score ~magical power~ stars, or gift spaces in order to score special abilities, such as an extra set of dice that'll potentially increase the number in a roll, or a card with a set number to move. Red spaces are bad...these will take away collected stars.  No matter how many people are playing, the game must be played with four characters...and honestly, I found myself so accustomed to rapidly hitting the action button to skip through the AI's actions that it was easier to do the same for my turn instead of attempting to find any ~skill~ in Disney's Party's board game mode.  There are four different board games to play, each set around a different amusement park theme...and each has its own set of platform challenges. The idea in these platform games is to run and jump through a level, throwing bombs at enemies and collecting stars while trying to get to the goal before time runs out. These challenges rate players on how many of the level stars were collected before hitting the goal, with an AA rating being a perfect, best of the best task. The difficulty level is driven by the sluggish control and sloppy collision detection...but I guess without these elements the challenges would be far easier to complete. These dozen or so platform challenges unlock after they've been uncovered in the board game, and if the kids really want to play them outside of the game (why they'd want to, I'll never know), they can simply select them from the main menu.  That's pretty much all there is to Disney's Party, and after one single play through it's off to conquer the ridiculously easy boss battle that sets off the credits sequence. The developers (believe it or not, it's the same studio that worked on Pokemon Pinball) include three unlockable, barely Disney-related multiplayer mini-games, including a strange bumpercars challenge and a terrible target-shooting game. These games are multi-system link cable challenges that only require one copy of the game to play. They're not very fun, though, so don't expect to get much enjoyment out of these hidden ~treats.~Yes, I'm aware that Disney's Party is aimed at the younger crowd, but I honestly can't imagine any kid finding this game fun. The board game is worse than Uncle Wiggly, and unlike the Mario Party, it barely involve interacting with the other players. They're just on the same board, racing to the designated point on the path. A good assortment of mini-games could have helped it along, but that didn't happen here; the challenges are just terrible Mario-style platform games. And the multiplayer mini-games are elements outside the main mode, designed completely separate from the boardgame.
