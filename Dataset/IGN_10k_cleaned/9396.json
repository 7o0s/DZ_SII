The gangs rule the brown and grey streets, while posters of upcoming videogame releases rule the walls. Not that I'm complaining about the ads. It's actually sort of like a bizarre form of realism. Meanwhile, the plot of this RTS/RPG mash-up is hardboiled fiction, where two screwed criminals and one corrupt cop are offered a single choice: help Agent Kovacs clean up Paradise City or rot in jail.   Most RPGs have players select their favorite class to work with, but Escape From Paradise City would rather have you muddle your way through them all, regardless of whether you prefer the ranged combat of Nick Porter, the close melee of Angela Vargas, or the Henchman wielding of Boris Chekov. The game is split into sixteen chapters, where you switch off between characters. Unfortunately, each chapter comes with a shiny impenetrable level cap, so if you're having trouble it just means you're out of luck. No grinding allowed.      Each character has three trees of abilities to go through depending on their fighting style and you'll get to spread out points among your primary attributes of body, perception, agility, concentration, and charisma, the lattermost being an index of the damage modifier of your henchmen. In the beginning only the corrupt cop can recruit the tough guys hanging around the bars, but if you take the skill for Nick and Angela then anyone can muscle in on his not-so cornered pet handling market. If your henchmen die, they respawn at the bar they came from, which seems fair. You have to retrain them from the beginning, which can often cost prohibitive amounts of cash, but at least they're not gone forever.    The map in each level is separated into zones for conquest, and your main goal is usually the elimination of a certain boss or the occupancy of some certain neighborhood. Conquering areas yields different benefits depending on what's around. Stores will give you cash; ammo depots sell weapons; bars sellcocktails, which in the game world, bestow a variety of buffs for critical hits, extra running speed, and the like.   All these neighborhood perks, plus the usual boost in Power Points (used for extra special moves ranging from calling in a bat swinging ruffian to, to ordering a terrorist-style poison strike on a zone) are crushingly removed if a gang manages to win the neighborhood back, so not only do you have to keep moving forward to your goal, but you also need to do a fair bit of emergency backtracking, unless you leave some ~Gangers~ behind. These recruits, bribed out of the crooked mayor, are supposedly provided to do your bidding, but more often than not they just run and aggro until they're all slaughtered.     While the territorial advancement certainly shouts strategy, the best way to play seemed to be in third person, where you have direct WSAD control over your character rather than the RTS-style point-and-click. Some of your skill moves require the other mode to work, but the most important is probably the medic, and you can use him any time. Calling a car is one move that does require the more overhead view, but it's worth the switch-over to have bullet-proof transport if you ever need to cross enemy territory.   I'm not sure why these modes couldn't just be condensed into something third person. If you could use your neighborhood specific moves by clicking on the map, you wouldn't have to screw around with the RTS mode at all, which would be great. It's more fun to run your characters around than use point-and-click even if you have to watch up close as Boris scratches his butt with the barrel of his gun, which is saying a lot because as idle animations go it's pretty nasty.   The look of the Paradise City is gritty at all times, with a hint of a City of Heroes feel to the urban landscape and the way the civilians mill around. While the characters animate decently, their vocal tags wear out at record speedeven the ones tied to weather patterns (i.e. Porter: ~Umbrellas are for sissies.~) Music is usually absent, the ambiance being thankfully left up to the city noise.   Probably the most compelling reason for getting this game would be to hop into a multiplayer fight and have gang wars with your friends. The goal can be assassination or simply territorial, but the important part is getting maximum clash value out of the ranged sizes of maps.  Despite the chance of interesting multiplayer scenarios, its still pretty hard to recommend Escape from Paradise City. Its not horrible by any means, but that doesnt mean we had fun playing it, which is kind of the whole point. Banging your head against the level caps means rewards come at a weird pace, based on level and not how much ass youre kicking, and the RTS/RPG dual control-style set-up has yet to been done in a way that makes it really feel necessary.", "date": "Nov 1, 2007"}
