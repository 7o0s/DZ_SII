Yeah, me too.   Well, before you throw down those cards for the last time, give  Mforma's World Poker Tour Texas Hold'em a download. It will completely re-energize your interest in all things flops and rivers. I'm not one to be swayed by licensed, especially one I'm so tired of seeing, but this officially licensed game really has the goods. Mforma uses the WPT license not as window dressing, but as a core feature of the game. You don't necessarily feel like you're there in the thick of it, but the approximation is enough to keep you hooked.   Most poker games are single-player, and World Poker Tour Texas Hold'em certainly has its own very competent one-player game. But it's the multiplayer feature that really blows my hair back. After a brief, painless registration, you can sit down at a table with five other human players and mix it up. The game unfolds just like it does on television, complete with a text-based announcer cluing you in on the ~official~ nicknames of your hands, such as an Oldsmobile.   Then the action moves around the table with players betting, calling, and folding. This had the possibility to be painfully slow, as I dunno about you, but I've played poker with some really indecisive people before. Poker isn't a game to be rushed -- but when I'm blowing minutes, I want to keep this action moving. Fortunately, World Poker Tour Texas Hold'em feels my pain. If you don't act within a few moments, it acts for you. For example, I folded with a crap-tastic hand after sitting there for a moment.   Players can move in and out of tables without penalty. This is good for when you only have a few minutes between classes or meetings to play a few hands. The game also features a chat feature with both auto comments and the ability to write your own message. I solicited a few opinions from other players about the game via this method and reaction was positive all around.   The single-player game moves a little faster than the online game and is a good place to practice for not only the mobile multiplayer, but for real world play, too. There is a simple practice session for those that need to get their footing, but you can play against some merciless suckers if so desired.   World Poker Tour Texas Hold'em features a really flashy presentation, just like on television. Everything from the use of official logos to table art is exactly on you see on the boob tube. You can create your own virtual avatar and while the top-down view of the table action doesn't exactly give you a good vantage point at seeing him/her in play, you can definitely pick out your player from a table of six. Cards are easy to read, too, which is absolutely imperative.  World Poker Tour Texas Hold'em is an absolute winner. Mforma worked close with the WPT to create the best mobile representation of the official poker show possible, and it paid off in silver dollars. The single-player game is good for practice, but I ended up spending the majority of my time in the online game against other people. The action is unpredictable there, especially with occasional jackasses raising and raising on dumb hands, forcing more cagey players to gnash their teeth, but no two games are ever the same. It keeps World Poker Tour Texas Hold'em evergreen. If you have even an inkling of interest in poker (providing the pop culture blitz hasn't bled it out of you), make World Poker Tour Texas Hold'em your next download. It's a knockout.", "date": "Jun 29, 2005"}
