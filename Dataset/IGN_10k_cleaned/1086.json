But before you go ahead and judge me on my shortcomings as a human being and write thousands of pieces of hate mail and death threats to me, read the review. I have my reasons for not giving Diablo II a perfect score. Plenty of them. But hark! What's this? Yes there are plenty of good things to go along with the bad. It is Blizzard after all, and they aren't known for making horrible products. So blaze on intrepid readers, I promise I'll be fair.  So first of all, I have to begin this article with a few words about the state of affairs with Battle.net and all of the bugs that are popping up in the game. I really am surprised about all of the complaints that are flowing into our mailboxes about problems that people are having with the game. We aren't even Blizzard, and we're getting a ton, so there are sure to be quite a few very unhappy gamers out there. The first thing that blares in my mind, and made me a bit wary of problems in the game was that the first day that the game was released, there was a patch out for the game. Ummm... yeah. You shouldn't need to download a patch right off the bat. And there is already another patch on the way. For the most part, I haven't experienced most of the problems that people are talking about, but one of my characters (a 17th level sorceress) did disappear after I logged onto Battle.net for the first time. I had already downloaded the patch and installed it before I started playing the game at all. Downloading the patch was what was supposed to be causing that glitch, but I guess it might just be logging onto Battle.net that was the problem. And Battle.net has been a big problem. After severely underestimating the amount of people that would want to play their game online (guh? Count the preorders maybe?), the servers crashed, burned and then bundled up in the corner weeping like Tal after being slapped around by Vincent on one of his ~bitchy~ days. To their credit, Blizzard has been working on the problem trying to fix it, and has managed to stabilize it quite a bit. But after people are paying anywhere from 55-70 dollars for the game, you would imagine that it would be a bug free, finished product. Oops.  Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I can continue on to the actual game. If I repeat myself a bit during the review, please excuse me, I've been battling the same monsters over and over for the last 5 hours straight and it's kinda gotten to me.  Let's start with the most obvious part of the game and why all of you clamber for screenshots all the time: the graphics. For having been in development for around three years, Diablo II really isn't the prettiest thing to look at. It is so much like the first Diablo, and in fact uses the Diablo engine, that it almost seems as though it's a very fancy expansion pack. Okay, maybe that is a bit unfair. Some of the detail in the levels is very good, particularly the dungeons of Act II. But the characters and monsters really aren't the best I've seen, actually look a bit dated at times, and don't look like the three years that went into them. The visuals are above average for sure, but not up to the excellence that we have come to expect.  The sound on the other hand is very good. All of the different monsters have their sounds which are all good, especially the little creepy guys with big heads and even bigger knives in Act III. The voice over acting is once again done with style and talent, and adds to the game immensely. Even the little things that the characters say when there is no more room in the inventory is done well. The music in the game is also very good adding to the ambiance of the game nicely. The music in the Harem level of Act II particularly sticks out in my mind, but it was all done well.   After all of that has been said, it's really the cinematic breaks between the acts that really let you know that you're playing a Blizzard game. They are absolutely fantastic. The folks who work on these should really think about doing full-length movies. I've watched them several times now and the animation, voice acting, and lighting effects are superb. The cinematics are about the only thing that I will want to do several times in this game however.  I mean, let's get down to the meat of things here. The gameplay is really fun and fast and action oriented. That is, fun for the first few hours. But then something happens. You begin to realize that the whole game is going to be like this. Fighting the same monsters disguised with different colors and names over and over again, only to wonder at your ability to commit genocide without any kind of repercussions. Only, when you've become proud of yourself for committing said genocide, you suddenly find that every time you start the game back up, all of the nasties will be back for you to wade through again. Thank god for Scrolls of Town Portal and Waypoints that make long travel easy. If they hadn't been put into the game, I'm not sure I wouldn't have turned off my computer in disgust.   Yet somehow, even with all of these complaints, I found myself jumping back into the game, in fact all of us here did, to fight the same creatures once again just to get a little farther. It makes me wonder whether Blizzard isn't getting a bit sneaky (read) and planting (ignpc) some subliminal messages (daily) in the game to make you keep coming back for more. Even with that said, I can't imagine that I will want to go back and play through the game with every character. In fact, once the evil god, Bnet, abducted my poor Sorceress, I bid farewell to her and kept on with Mr. Fartypants, the Barbarian conqueror. I won't start up the Sorceress again for the same reasons that I wouldn't have my tonsils reattached so I could get them taken out a second time with different scissors. If there was a more complex system of battle involved, like that of Revenant, it probably would keep my interest a little bit longer. As it is, all the incessant clicking sound from the mouse does is mark my progress towards an early case of arthritis.  These are my opinions and tastes, so you're welcome to disagree, but something that I'm sure that we'll all agree on is how easy it is to actually get into playing the game. Diablo II has a fantastic interface. Everything about it is great. Inventory, character info, and skill tree only take up half of the screen so you can see if you are getting attacked. The only time that the entire screen is taken filled is when you get into your stash or talk to vendors, and that only happens when you're safe in the confines of a town. When you go up in level you get the chance to upgrade your stats or your skills in your own time and one at a time so that you can still defend yourself if needs be.  Speaking of skills (oh man that was a great segue), one of the really great things about Diablo II is the skill tree. This really is one of the things in the game that keep you going. You think, ~if I can just get to that next level, I can grab that next great skill.~ And there are lots of unique skills for each character that are all upgradeable so you can get really powerful in one or take the broad approach. The tree works so that you need to learn certain skills in order to get the more powerful ones later in the game. And while this might annoy some people because they have to spend a point on a skill that they aren't likely to use, it just makes sense to do it that way.  All of the skills and inherent abilities of the characters makes the game really well balanced, an area in which Blizzard has always excelled. Each of the characters has it's own advantages and disadvantages that make it well worth experimenting with each to decide what style of play you'll want to adopt. When in multiplayer, it becomes apparent what kind of roles the different classes play. From the Barbarian, who gets thrown into the thick of things to absorb most of the damage, to the Sorceress who acts as artillery support much of the time. The easiest character to play with is the Barbarian, as it takes little to no skill to whack at things. If you're looking for a bit more strategy in your game, then you'll want to head towards the magic users of the group.  So now that I've rambled on the good and bad points and confused all of you to death as to whether I like the game or not, the question is posed: Do I like the game? Well ... yeah I guess. This unfortunately is one of those games that gets thrown into the love/hate category because of the repetitive gameplay, excellent interface, hit and miss graphics, beautiful sound work, and buggy code. There's a lot of fun here, but there's a lot of frustration as well. Diablo II is a good game, but it isn't a great game. Once all of the bugs get knocked out it will be a little better, but not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag.   -- Dan Adams    Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 8, 2000"}
