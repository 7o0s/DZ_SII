For some reason, there's a devoted following behind Transformers and yet an unreasoned, unbridgeable split between old-school Transformer Autobot fans and neo-digi Transformer Predacon buff. Any time somebody mentions the car Transformers in the same sentence as the dino Transformers, they're crucified and stoned.   Does either show deserve such a crowd? According to the history of the Transformer videogames, nope and double-nope. The shows may have tough characters and hot effects, but the games are just gross assemblages of polygons (or, in the case of really old Transformer games, vectors and sprites) wrapped around the need to punch and shoot stuff.    Gameplay Transformers Beast Wars Transmetals clones and crimps from the stylebook of Virtual On and Power Stone, but the skimmed surface gameplay here doesn't nearly match the deep style of those better efforts. If you've played The Neverhood's Boombots, you know what can go wrong in a free-roaming, projectile-flinging fighter. Now try Boombots with a quarter the cast, half the control, zero logic in the gameplay, and a frustration factor of a mechanical banging-the-head-on-the-wall machine malfunctioning, and you may approach the joy of playing this new Beast Wars.  ~But IGNguy, it's Transformers! That's cool~ ~No, IGNreader, it's actually Beast Wars -- Get it right! But it's still cool.~ Hey, you're both wrong. The gameplay here is a jankie fighting game with characters that vaguely represent polygons similarly laid out like the Beast Wars characters. Although hand-to-hand combat and weapon fighting seems perfect for a Transformers game, it's off here.  The close combat battling is truly awkward. The game voluntarily switches between hand-to-hand and projectile fighting by proximity, but the collision detection is already off, so you can bet that the type of attack you want at a given instance will botch when you try to fight. Fighting speed is far too fast for the hulking lugs from the show. They throw simple 1-2-3 combo punches with button mashing, and their special moves are limited to charge moves while holding down the attack button. You can transform into Beast mode and then have more attacks at your disposal, but not many more, and the Beasts cannot throw projectiles.   The projectile fighting is worse. The game lets you fill the screen with shots, meaning fight fans will spend most of their time either on their back or trying to shoot through the flak  (blocking can only be done while standing perfectly still, and you still take damage). Your only choice is to run around and hope attacks mindlessly track into obstacles on the battlefield, but then you can't fight back because your attacks are just as pointless. You'll have to come out of hiding sometime, and when you do, you're scrap metal.  There are also Super Attacks and Tackle Crushers, which inflict massive damage if used right. These are the sweet specials that look so sharp in Capcom games that you try to save up for these attacks. Here, unfortunately, the graphic soup swills the fun out of these attacks, and they don't always do much damage anyway (you can build some by pummeling the buttons, but the net is still wholly without technical skill on the player's part.)   Aside from all this, there is crap strewn about in the battlefield that can be thrown at or negatively affect your play, but as always, getting these to work in your favor is a killer. In the snow-swept field, you just fall down all the time, even when breeze isn't touching you (and might I say that stumbling around like a baby calf isn't the pinnacle of fun in a fighting game). Or try getting juggled on boulders that fall when you get shot in the waterfall stage. Or how about when you're finally rocking away and you have trapped an enemy over by the myopic security gun (which couldn't spot a VW bus at ten paces) and you get to sit and watch as every single shot strays wide like a Scott Norwood Buffalo punt?  Graphics What's funny about this game is the energy that went into futzed graphic presentation. The game tries so hard to hide how awful it looks, and it never gives up. For instance, the special attacks sometimes have whole effects devoted to themselves, so when one Predacon attacks, the screen goes black and all you see are eyes and claw-marks. Brilliant, except for that neither graphic looks too good or impressive. But when you figure out what the heck you're supposed to be looking at is, you can't help but laugh and say, ~Gosh, what a horribly executed flawed good idea!~  Much of the graphic failing here comes from the show itself, which many would argue is digitally stale and glossy with effects. Same goes for the character design in the PlayStation game. The Transformers all have reflection-mapped chrome bodies in the game, with largely inexpressive faces and too-similar facial features. The difference between the TV show and the PlayStation characters is, of course, one millionth less resolution. Here, they're blocky and pixilated beyond recognition, only vaguely representing the toy figures when still. And with this game's awful framerate (the Transformers seem to morph from Beast to Robot in a single frame) and bewildered camera (which seems to randomly choose angles for specials, whether they be behind the action, in back of an obstacle, or underneath the floor), the look is sloppy.  To be fair, some of the graphics are super-sharp and impressive, which just blows me away and reminds me again of how much Bay Area Multimedia tried to get this game looking okay. When you first go up against the Predacon Rampage, you'll be blown away that his size and the scale of your tiny bot against a gigantic spider. He's freaking massive! Of course, he just throws the same attacks everybody else does, and the strategy in fighting his is none smarter than any other battle, so the thrill goes away quickly, but first impressions are good. Same goes for some of the backdrops. Granted, only a slim few look more than slapdash pixel amalgamations (particularly the horrid indoor zones), but the Mountain zone with a waterfall behind it looks great. And the game uses FMV done, I assume, with the resources from the TV show (if not actually by Mainframe).  Sound Again, they tried so hard! The developers at Genazea didn't have access to the Beast Wars voice talents (for unknown reasons -- most of the cartoon talent I know are all-too-happy for a paycheck), but the voices they hired do their damndest to liven up the game's FMV and characters. And though the FVM is woefully off lip-sync, the energy in the acting makes up for that in sorts. (The opening cinematic, however, is awful in an ~It Came From The '80s~ direct-to-video kind of way.)  And then all that production work just falls apart in gameplay. First off, using whole catch phrases for a rapid attack just doesn't work. The voices just repeat and roll over each other and cut out all over the place. Entire fights sound like when your grandpa used to make fun of rap music's scratching DJs -- ~Take-a-Take-a-T-t-t-t-Take That!~ The other effects just fall into the noise level with the voiceover and constant gun effects. And it helps none that once you win and finally break out of the sound mire, you're treated to a single, repetitive taunt.    True, I'm not a big fan of the Beast Wars series. I'll admit to that. Plenty tell me that the show has great characters and soap stories.  Swell. But if you have gigantic robots that fight other gigantic robots with super-power guns and transform into big monsters, but you can't make a good videogame of that... Something's wrong with the formula.But fans want to know, is this for them? Will they enjoy this game? Would they feel justified sending a big ~F' U!~ letter to this reviewer? Probably not. There are all kinds of right thought ideas in the game, particularly the ability to play the Story mode through as either a Maximal or an evil Predacon (complete with different storylines to follow). And the gameplay is at least haphazard enough to make kids smile in two-player rumbles. But there's no actual story in the Story mode, and there's no gameplay in any mode. It's not fun, and even the office's Beast Wars fans could hardly stand it. If there has ever been a hard-and-fast rule in gaming (excepting one Madden release), it's this: Never trust a direct-to-rental game. Even they don't expect you to play more than a weekend's worth.", "date": "Jun 27, 2000"}
