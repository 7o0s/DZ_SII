In America, where online mobile gaming has not yet taken fire, releasing Path of a Warrior is an intriguing risk. Is audience that gobbles up casual fare like Tetris and Ms. Pac-Man willing to take a five-dollar (plus airtime) risk on an online role-playing game?   For the sake of continued innovation and the expanded borders of mobile gaming, I certainly hope so. I just wish that a game with such an ambitious future took more risks with its game play. If you're familiar with the tenets and staples of hack-and-slash dungeon crawlers like the PC megasmash Diablo, then you have a pretty good idea of what you're getting into when you strap on the metal gauntlets of Gamevil's latest. It consists of wading into field after field of enemies and jamming on an attack button to wage war. Clear the screens and move on to an inevitable boss encounter. And hopefully, while doing battle with the army of rival lordships, you'll score some fat loot.    Collecting treasure, weapons, armor, and items is a big part of Path. Gamevil has stocked the shelves with over 1,000 pieces of inventory for you to discover through battle, shopping, or item fusion. Between battles, you can equip your warrior with gear, weapons, and useful trinkets. As you equip these items, you can judge their effect on personal stats and decide the best load-out for the next scenario.   I seriously doubt that any American player will ever see all 1,000-plus items, but just the knowledge that there is likely always a better sword or helmet out there is inspiration enough to keep hardcore dungeon crawlers playing. I've always been more impressed with game mechanics than hidden treasures, so this kind of compulsion didn't exactly move me. The action itself isn't bad by any stretch, but it is repetitive. Slash, kill, heal, kill, slash, walk, kill, heal, slash, story, shop. You fall into a rhythm of sorts, and rhythms aren't exactly too far from ruts. But, as I freely admit, I know lots of gamers that really enjoy this kind of game play. Look at how many people pay $15 a month to grind levels in World of Warcraft.   Path's scope extends between just the ample inventories. There are hundreds of screens full of bad guys, each under the rule of a different warlord. When you begin the game, the land is rife with chaos and carnage. Rival regimes want to assume control and bring about law and order, but they require a strong warrior to further their cause. The course of the branching story changes depending on which factions you ally with. Eventually, you will see one of 24 possible endings. Again, that dangles some replay value in front of gamers that enjoy checking out everything a game has to offer.   Gamevil Live, the mobile maker's online service, features heavily in Path of a Warrior's future. The service, when implemented, will allow you to try out new guild scenarios to see which group has the bigger sword. One on one battles, four-player co-op, and a special siege scenario round out the online game modes in Path. Players that go online also have access to special online-only items.   Currently, the only live features available for Path is an online marketplace and item storage should you run out of room in your rucksack. So, if you do happen upon an ultra-rare weapon or whatnot, you can take it to a community marketplace and see who is willing to trade for it. These are cool to see, but I'm really waiting to try out the guild features. When they go out over the network, I will return to Path of a Warrior with an update on the new package.  The current release of Path of a Warrior, without all of its promised online functionality, is a solid hack-and-slash action-RPG that genre fans will likely enjoy. Your missions are sized perfectly for mobile. Get in, kill and maim for five minutes, get some loot, and flip the phone shut. Personally, I think the scope of the game with its branching storyline and huge inventory are really cool features, but in the end, I found the rhythm of the game just too repetitive for my tastes. Dungeon crawler fans, your mileage may vary.", "date": "Jan 25, 2007"}
