Others have tried but none have been able to match the success of T Hawk.  Each subsequent version of the game has only gotten better.  Now, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 ollies its way onto Xbox.  While essentially the same as the PS2 and GameCube versions, it does feature slightly better graphics, less slow down, and a few extra goodies to reward patient Xbox owners.   FeaturesOver 20 characters, each with their own special tricks  Supports customized soundtracks  Several multiplayer modes  Massive levels in beautiful detail  Create-a-park mode so you can make your own skate park  Exclusive Xbox level and secret character!  Gameplay  Slip on your Chucks and grab a board.  Take control of one of nearly two dozen skaters and grind your way around a plethora of massive levels.  THPS3 is packed with modes to provide endless hours of play.  This is easily its best feature.  This is one of those extremely rare games where you will play it from the day you buy it until the day the next installment is released.  It's that good and it's that deep.   The bulk of game time is devoted to Career Mode.  Each level has a variety of goals that must be completed to open new levels.  These goals include getting sick scores of up to 500,000 points, grinding certain areas, collecting the letters S-K-A-T-E, and performing certain actions (like soaking the foreman).  In Hawk 2, your main focus was getting money so you could buy new tricks and raise your stats.  The money is gone, replaced by five stat points strewn about each level.  This is a good thing.  Skating, even professional skating, has never projected the image of being about the Benjamins.   Also hidden in each level is a new deck design.  There are three competition levels mixed in.  Here your goal is to get a ton of points over three runs.  Getting gold will require some skill, but will earn you kudos from your fellow skaters.   The button layout will be familiar to those who owned Tony Hawk 2X.  The grinds and vert tricks work almost exactly like Hawk 2X.  There's a balance meter for grinds and for manuals, taking away the need to judge your character's balance merely by visuals.  It can be a bit of a strange change at first, needing to keep an eye on the meter while grinding.  But after a few runs, it will become natural.  The balance meter offers more control and will be a big help in pulling off long trick lines.  Manuals are a little easier to pull off now, and you'll need them.  In Hawk 2 you could survive on vert tricks.  Hawk 3 is almost completely opposite.  The air from verts aren't nearly as high.  This game is all about grinds and manuals and it's a great change.  Yes, old strategies will need to be changed, especially for getting Sick Scores, but there are so many luscious gaps to find, and tons of places to grind, anyone lover of the T Hawk series will embrace the change.     The main addition to the gameplay is the revert.  By pressing the trigger just before landing from a vert trick or an invert, you can continue the trick line.  You'll need to do an ollie or a manual immediately after the revert to keep the line alive.  This allows for long trick lines and some insane points.  Scoring is much higher in Hawk 3, and the objective goals reflect this change.     The levels are insane.  As with previous versions of Tony Hawk, the environments are realistic and often based on actual locations.  There's a cruise ship, a foundry, Los Angeles (complete with freeway and an earthquake), and even a hidden pirate ship.  Each level has at least one area that can be used to open a new cinematic.  In Canada, for example, you'll have to ~unstuck Chuck~ who's been foolish enough to lick a frozen flagpole.  Grinding certain spots will cause minor changes in levels as well, allowing access to new areas sometimes or even causing an earthquake.     My love for Hawk cannot be fully expressed in words.  The game is addictive.  It's like a potato chip.  Once you've had one, you need another.  Next thing you know, you're at the store buying five bags.  You pick up Hawk 3 and you won't be putting it down.  It's not enough to 100% the game with a single character, you'll want to beat it with everyone.  And you'll want to search out new gaps, find new lines to run.  Quite honestly, this is one of the deepest and most complete games to hit a console.  Each year Activision brings out a new Tony Hawk, and each year it raises the bar even higher.   For those who have played through Hawk 2, the newest installment won't be nearly as hard to finish.  Because so much of the gameplay remains intact, it's easy to pick up and run with.  That's not to say Hawk 3 isn't a better game, but if you are comfortable with Hawk 2, you'll be able to step right into Hawk 3 with no problem.     Almost all of the skaters are highly customizable.  You can switch out different shirts, pants, shoes, and elbow pads.  This is something Activision didn't need to add, but put in anyway.  Boards can also be prettied up the way you like them with a variety of grip tapes and wheel colors to choose from.  The create-a-player is solid.  You can change hair, weight, height, and facial features to make yourself as a skater or even make a close imitation of Freddy Kreuger.     As if there wasn't enough to keep you playing late into the night with the single-player modes, T Hawk 3 has some nice multiplayer options as well.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 features four-player system link, so you don't have to deal with those annoying split screens.  There are five multiplayer modes available:  Trick Attack:  Go against a friend in any opened level to see who can bust out the best tricks and score the most points.  Graffiti:  Trick everywhere to ~tag~ it with your color.  Your opponent will have to do a better trick to tag over the same area.  Horse:  The classic game of Horse, but with skateboards.  One person tricks and the next must match the point total or better it.  If they don't, they get a letter.  Once you spell horse, start hee-hawing.  Slap!:  Tag, you're it!  Chase after your pals, trying to knock into them and slap 'em.  The one with the most slaps when time runs out wins.  King of the Hill:  Race to find the crowns and become king of the hill.   Not enough to please you?  Think 100+ hours of gameplay doesn't justify the purchase of a game?  Well, Neversoft never stops with their bag of goodies.  Tony Hawk 3 includes a park editor mode, allowing you to create your own masterwork.  There's plenty of rails, stairs, pools, ramps, and shrubbery to put into your little world.  You can create gaps and set up start locations for a game of horse.  I just love making my own park and then challenging my friends to hit the gaps and beat my high score.  Tony Hawk 3 is about as complete as a game can be.    Graphics  The game moves fast and maintains 60fps throughout most of the levels.  There is some slowdown, most noticeable at the start of levels.  It's much smoother than on PS2 or GameCube, with a lot of the worst slowdown areas being dramatically improved.  The slowdown won't hurt your enjoyment of this title, so I can't knock the game down too hard for it.  Yes, it would be nice if it was as smooth as a line from Shaft and wasn't occasionally as choppy as a Dolemite fight scene, but as long as it doesn't interfere with the game, I can live with it.   The levels are huge and in great detail.  While the textures aren't quite the best I've seen, they are pretty close.  And for those with a love for blood, the Xbox version has slightly better smears when you tank a grind than the GameCube or PS2.  Every character is fully animated and some of the tricks they pull off will make your jaw drop.  And there are tricks aplenty.  I found myself slotting in every special trick I could get my hands on just to see what they looked like.   The environments are filled with pedestrians and cars more than willing to get in your way or run you over.  Other extreme sport games often have a feeling that you are alone in the world.  But with Hawk, it's as if you're taking to the actual streets.  Birds fly by, bystanders react to your passing, and cops chase robbers on the streets of L.A.  There's steam billowing out of pipes and flames shooting out of furnaces.  The only thing that really hampers the graphics is the slowdown.  Which, as stated before, is a lot less severe than what's found on the other consoles.   Sound  The soundtrack snap, crackles, and pops with goodness.  As my good pal David Smith noted in his PS2 review, the game has Motorhead.  How cool is that?  Hawk has been known for its killer soundtrack and THPS3 is no different.  But if you do get sick of these fine tunes, you can slip in your own customized soundtrack.  Yeah, the feature that isn't used nearly enough on the Xbox is here in Hawk 3.  Hopefully other developers take note.   The sound effects are nice, with everything you do with your board associated to a different sound.  Grinds, bails, and the roll of your wheels on the concrete are good.  Pedestrians will chatter as you pass them by.  Some offer compliments while others call you out, trying to get you to pull off a big trick for their approval.   Though THPS3 came out on PS2 several month ago, it doesn't come off as stale or overdone.  Certainly anyone who has never played the game should pick it up.  It's something all gamers should experience.  The graphics are solid, the soundtrack is great, and it's incredibly fun.  If you've already got the game on another console, there are some extras for the Xbox that may merit a trade-in.  The custom soundtrack ability alone is worth it to me.  Plus it's got a cool new character and a new level that Activision calls a preview of things to come in Hawk 4.  Tony Hawk came around several years ago and knocked the industry silly.  It's responsible for spawning numerous imitators, but the original is still far and away the king, baby.", "date": "Mar 6, 2002"}
