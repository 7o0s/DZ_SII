The Big N's famous Italian plumber-hero jumps across surreal, not to mention sometimes-nostalgic worlds and battles a cast of foes including angry flowers, gaseous super-villains, and even a toad-nerd undoubtedly inspired by some of the very message board posters who complain about videogames on a weekly basis. This is a silly project, but don't be fooled by the primary colors and goofy characters because underneath the cute exterior lies a very clever and challenging affair that, while not perfect in every way possible, still easily ranks amongst the top-tier of Wii games to date.  There is a history to this franchise that you may already know about, but bear with us. Paper Mario debuted for Nintendo 64 in 2001 and introduced the now-recognizable cut-out, paper style and RPG-light gameplay mechanics which were later carried over to a 2004 GameCube sequel, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. These titles employed a classic 2D perspective reminiscent of early platformers, and yet there was very little true platforming to be found. Occasionally, the flat look of the efforts was contrasted against purely aesthetic 3D perspective changes; for instance, a seemingly 2D house would fold inward into 3D space as Mario entered it. Additionally, both projects utilized turn-based battle systems -- a trademark of the RPG genre for so many years.     Super Paper Mario is obviously inspired by these games -- one look at the similarly flimsy-thin characters and simplistic 2D backdrops is proof enough of that  -- and yet it's also refreshingly different from them. It foregoes the RPG feel of its predecessors in favor of a pleasing new emphasis on speedy platforming. The turn-based battles of old have been completely discarded to make way for on-the-fly enemy encounters, which we happen to prefer. The Thousand-Year Door featured a dynamic battle system, but not nearly as dynamic as real-time controls -- running and jumping atop the heads of enemies is immediately accessible and enjoyable and it's also a natural fit for any 2D interpretation of the Mushroom Kingdom. That all being true, the project hasn't completely ditched the RPG mechanics of old. Mario still gains access to new items as he progresses through the storyline and you will notice some genre cliches, too, from experience and hit points to leveling up. To use a cliche of our own, Nintendo really has reworked the old and made it new again.  The game begins slowly with about 20 minutes of exposition that slaps you in the face again and again with the premise. Princess Peach is confused and shocked when she wakes from a dazed state to discover that she's at the wedding altar and about to be married to Bowser, but before she can protest and run for the hills she's hypnotized into saying ~I do.~ This unexpected union of beauty and the beast triggers an event as foretold in the Dark Prognosticus, a book that predicts the end of all worlds by Count Bleck, a well-mannered but still devious foe who will stop at nothing to bring about chaos. A void is opened in reality and it threatens to swallow up everything unless the hero of light, Mario, can obtain seven life hearts which will, as foretold in the Light Prognosticus, enable him to defeat the enemy.   Some of the levels in the game are beautiful -- just look at this space shooter sequence.  The story unfolds in text bubble after text bubble in an endless stream of letters, words, paragraphs, scrolls and, eventually, novels. The opening ~cinematics,~ if you can really call them that, foreshadow the title's wordy approach to spinning a yarn -- you will find later that even fourth string characters have too much to say -- and also demonstrates why Super Paper Mario is, despite its graphical facade, probably not well-suited for younger gamers; there's just too much text that needs to be read. These long-winded speeches have a way of interfering with the pacing of the game and there will be occasions when you just want to hammer the 1 button on the Wii remote to cycle through the words and return to the gameplay, but won't for fear of missing a key point. The irony is that the writing is clever and amusing -- there's just a ridiculous amount of it. Nintendo of America's translation team has tapped into pop culture for funny and charming results and you may even pick up on some of the references. One of the managerial foes speaks like a character right out of the movie Office Space and there are countless pokes at the Internet groupies who live and die by the message boards, for example.   You begin the game with Mario, but later pick up more party members, including Peach and Bowser, all of whom possess unique strengths and weaknesses. Mario is the quickest on his feet, can jump the highest, and is the only character able to switch between the second and third dimension. Peach, on the other hand, can float effortlessly across chasms that nobody else can traverse and Bowser can breathe fire at enemies for easy take-downs. They're all fun to play for different reasons and you can easily rotate between the mascots at any point simply by pressing the 1 and 2 buttons together and accessing the character menu, which is a plus since there are some well-designed puzzles that require you to use two or more of the heroes to continue forward. The dynamic feels good, but as the title chugs on and you move through the chapters, you will begin to notice that you only occasionally need to make use of Peach or Bowser because Mario is more than capable of handling most of the hurdles by his lonesome. In fact, since going between 2D and 3D is so fundamentally important to playing the game, it is impossible to continue as Peach or Bowser for any prolonged amount of time -- a small shortcoming, as far as we're concerned.   In addition to the playable mascots, Mario regularly encounters new fairy-like creatures called Pixls which grant the entire party special powers. Simply press the 1 and 2 buttons together to quickly access the Pixls screen and you can select from Thoreau (pick up objects and throw them), Bomber (bombs), Carrie (a floating platform that you can stand on to increase your speed and traverse spiked floorings), Dottie (turns Mario into a miniscule-sized version of himself) or Fleep (flips objects located on the other sides of walls or dimensions into your side). There are a half dozen more Pixls that we won't spoil for you. These items act as a successful driving force for the game because they do change the way you play and what you are capable of as you traverse the environments. Like classic Zelda or Metroid, you may every so often pass by an area with a tiny warp pipe or a cracked wall that may seem useless for a time, but as soon as you are able to turn small and lay bombs respectively, these areas become gateways to more locales and possibly other valuable items. Applying the abilities of the Pixls in order to advance is a hugely satisfying endeavor, in our experience. Not only that, but they also play an integral role in some enemy combat challenges. There are a variety of spiked enemies who can be easily bested when you're hovering along with the Carrie Pixl, as an example.      There are the mascots and the Pixls, of course, but Super Paper Mario's main attraction is its dichotomy between the 2D and 3D perspectives and, more specifically, the puzzles that lay hidden within each dimension. A seemingly innocent 2D-style platformer level is only half of each stage -- the other half exists in 3D space. You can tap the A button at any point to go into 3D and back again and there advantages and disadvantages to the different perspectives. The 2D plain presents a very clear, side-to-side view of the stage, but what looks like an insurmountable wall in the flat perspective transforms into a pillar that can be side-stepped in 3D. Background bushes in 2D hide a hidden walkway in the third dimension. Dead-ends in 2D house invisible doorways only seen in 3D. Even enemies that cannot be seen in one dimension materialize in the other. You will have to go back and forth all the time in order to advance, which makes for some very compelling and clever puzzles. There will be ~Oh, wow -- that's really smart!~ moments and as the game progresses, they happen more frequently. Meanwhile, for every second that Mario remains in 3D, his life bar decreases, and when it drops to empty he loses a hit point. Luckily, the bar recharges when he returns to the 2D plain. It's a balance and you must learn to respect it.   Super Paper Mario overwhelms you with storyline and dialog text. The writing is amusing, though.  The puzzles made possible because of the 2D-to-3D relationship are sometimes outstanding, but in terms of presentation, the second dimension is far more beautiful than the third. There are seven or eight differing worlds complete with unique backdrops, from the colorful Bitlands (which showcases pixelated backdrops inspired by classic Mario games) to outer space shooter levels, underwater areas, cave environments and desert scenarios. There is a lot to see, but it all looks much better in 2D. From the flat perspective, Mario navigates colorful levels complemented by stylized art and brought to cartoony life with detailed particle effects. However, the backgrounds are largely transformed into flat and barren square landscapes in 3D and they are simply not even half as interesting as their 2D counterparts, which is a disappointment.   Like Twilight Princess, Super Paper Mario was originally a GameCube title designed for a traditional controller. When Nintendo moved the game to Wii, though, Intelligent Systems reworked the controls to take advantage of the Wii remote. Thankfully, the developer did not implement a wide number of gesture-based actions simply for the gimmick of swinging the Wii remote around. In contrast, it has thoughtfully approached the prospect of utilizing the device and the end result is a title that plays classically and doesn't beat you over the head with waggle action. You simply hold the Wii-mote on its side, control Mario and party with the D-Pad, and occasionally point the Wii remote at the screen to illuminate hidden doorways or to find out information about characters and objects. You can also shake the Wii remote as you jump atop the heads of enemies for style points. Amateurs will never bother with this ability and that's fine -- it's not necessary, after all -- but pros will see how far they can take it, amassing more and more style points for harder-to-beat enemies in hopes of upping experience and hit points.  Super Paper Mario proves the point that even as Nintendo makes titles like Wii Sports and Wario Ware, it hasn't forgotten about the hardcore gamer. The title not only harkens back to the days of the 2D platformer, but retains enough of the RPG mechanics to satisfy players who liked the previous outings in the franchise. And unlike some Wii titles, which can be completed in an afternoon, this undertaking will keep you busy for a good 20 hours, give or take -- incidentally, you'll find yourself challenged more and more as the quest progresses.  Play as Mario, Peach and Bowser, among others. You should buy this game for a number of reasons. It's a Mario game and for some that will be enough. It's also one part platformer and another part RPG, successfully dabbling in both genres. It controls tightly and uses the Wii remote in a smart manner without stepping into forced territory. The new 2D-to-3D dynamic is built around clever and surprisingly complex puzzles that will challenge and impress you. And it all comes together to make Super Paper Mario a highly enjoyable title, whether you want to call it a platformer, an RPG, or something in-between. You will have fun and the fun will last for a good while, plain and simple. And with that being said, that doesn't mean that the game is a work of perfection because that isn't true. The writing is well-crafted and humorous, but there is so much to read that it actually interrupts the flow of the game. Meanwhile, the 3D perspectives tend to look barren and boring even as the 2D views showcase stylized and colorful backdrops befitting of a classic Mario game. These gripes keep Super Paper Mario from becoming a truly masterful endeavor, but they don't stop us from recommending it as a must-buy for any Nintendo fan.", "date": "Apr 5, 2007"}
