Sure, it's a strategy game, but it's so much more. It's a complete economic and military simulation depicting the three hundred years from Columbus to Napoleon. You take charge of one of the great powers of Europe in the wars for empire that raged across the whole globe. Recent historical scholarship suggests that we view this period as a World War as the conflicts involved so many nations and were fought in far flung locales. Europa Universalis captures this feeling perfectly. And while that would be enough for most strategy games, this one adds deep diplomatic and religious models to the mix.  While some of the more studious players enjoy the contemplative grand strategy of games like Civilization, there are other gamers who prefer the immediacy of something like Age of Empires. Europa does an excellent job of bringing those two experiences together. But while it brings a real time approach to the genre, it maintains the larger strategic perspective missing from most RTS games. You won't actually command any of your armies in the field. You'll simply move them from territory to territory and let your commanders do the fighting. But you'll have more than enough control over every other aspect of your empire to keep you busy.  I said before that this game approaches Civilization in terms of enjoyment and approach. The main difference, apart from the real-time aspect, is the focus on a particular era. Where Civilization took a more general approach out of necessity, the narrower context for the game means that a lot more detail can be thrown in. This game simulates just about every aspect of empire management. And, like all good empire games, every single event is tied to every other event in a bizarre yet intuitive web of consequence. Damn that's a good sentence.  The interface isn't pretty but it gets the job done. When you consider everything the game tries to do, the fact that it runs as well as it does is impressive. The interface is a little clunky but it captures the feel of a large board game. You'll have to move your armies and fleets across a map of the world comprised of over 700 territories; Italy itself is made up of a dozen or so, separate zones. And the players are just as numerous. Okay, not as numerous, but with sixty or so players in any given game, things tend to get complicated fast.  As big as the game is, you must accept the fact that victory will never be absolute. The best you can do is...well, the best you can do. Most games put a premium on total world domination. Here victory is measured in degrees. You will be given various missions throughout the game (secure alliance with a particular country, capture and hold a particular territory, etc.). Each mission you accept will increase your victory points (or decrease them if you fail) but you can also gain points through political negotiations, exploration and conquest. The best you can hope for is to leave your country better than you found it, while still preserving some semblance of balance.  Given that you'll never rise to a position of supreme power over your enemies, you'll need to rely on a complex system of alliances. Your neighbors each have their own agendas and, when their needs meet your own, you'll have to chance to link up with them. The diplomatic model offers lots of flexibility. You can arrange marriages, set up trade embargoes and exact indemnity from your defeated foes. In fact, although it sounds weird to us 4Xers, drafting peace treaties is the main way that your empire will grow.  The economic model is just as complex. There are dozens of resources to be traded in the game. Each has its own dynamic supply and demand model so, for instance, opening up the cotton or tobacco trade in the New World will be involve large expense initially but will pay huge dividends for the player who has the infrastructure to handle it. And you'll have to appoint merchants in each of the world's trading centers to take advantage of the money coming in. For those of us who passed ECO101 only because we were having sex with the teacher, the game includes a really useful auto management function.  Cash coming in can be spent on army and fleet creation, colonization efforts and technology research. Rather than spending cash on particular advancements, you'll simply specify priorities. As you pour more money into a particular area (military, navy, trade, and infrastructure), you'll be rewarded with advances. You'll also need to set a certain amount of money aside to keep your country stable. The stresses of war and colonization take their toll on the populace of the world. Sending a little cash their way alleviates those tensions. Adherence to a particular religious creed is also a big part of the game  But as good as it is, Europa has its share of problems. The message windows are out of control. They pop up with frustrating frequency. There's an option to disable some of the messages but, apart from the ~such and such unit arrives at such and such territory~ messages, most of them are too important to disregard. It might not sound like much, but you can get a lot of messages in the game. At the very least, the ~army arrives at~ and ~army attacks enemy~ messages could have been lumped together. The ~go to~ command within the message box is also poorly conceived. It fails to close the window, and just centers on the province without jumping immediately to the battle view.  The game is also hampered by a half-assed tutorial that explains most of the game functions but fails to address how the various elements of the game relate to each other. For instance, you learn which buttons create armies, but you don't learn how the creation of armies fits in to an overall strategic plan. Normally, you'd be able to go the manual for this type of information but there are problems here as well. There's no index and, worse still, not even a table of contents. I wouldn't mind if the manual wasn't 120 pages long. As it is, it's a good read with lots of relevant information. Good luck finding what you're looking for -- like how to conquer a province that you've occupied or how to maintain your supply lines so your armies don't start dying off.  But these aren't really serious deficiencies. And once you've read the manual four or five times, you'll be able to handle even the most obscure task. Handy pop-up tips are always there for the truly lost and if you wait just a second, a much more descriptive text box comes up explaining how the control works in game terms. In some cases you'll get a much more intensive summary screen showing the specifics on, say, trade or taxes or political status.  Luckily, the game includes multiplayer support. But unfortunately this isn't a game well suited to multiplay. For one thing, the ability to pause the game is totally missing from multiplayer. And although you can have eight human players (and up to 60 or so NPC nations) in the game, the scenarios don't bother balancing the player nations. So you might wind up playing a country that has very little chance of competing with the other countries. And this isn't just a ~it's a little harder with the Dutch~ kind of difficulty; it's a full on ~The Swedes have just taken everything I own~ kind of difficulty. The lack of a player search service means that you'll have to find people to play with on your own. But with such a massive single player component, you'll hardly bother with multiplayer.  This is a huge game. I've been playing it for weeks now and am only now just getting an idea of what's possible. It's too bad that the tutorial and manual aren't more helpful in getting you familiar with the game. But I seem to remember it taking me a long time to come to grips with everything Civilization allowed me to do, too. Europa requires the same type of investment but, once you've got the basics down, you're going to be every bit as eager as I am to continue discovering what this amazing game has to offer.  -- Steve Butts Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  or send some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Mar 21, 2001"}
