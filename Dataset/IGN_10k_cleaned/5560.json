The property has an enormous (and rabid) fan base, recently reinvigorated by its evening showings on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. The anime series deals with mildly mature relationship themes and features some fairly hard violence (but not overwhelmingly so), which is what you would expect from a show about a half-demon.   Inuyasha has been a long time coming -- the game was announced early last year, and so it was with great anticipation that we got our hands on an LG VX7000 with the game pre-loaded for our gaming pleasure. The best way to describe Inuyasha is to liken it to an old NES side-scrolling beat-'em-up, the kind that emerged by the hundreds in the NES glory days. But unlike the mostly forgettable hordes that cluttered Toys R Us shelves, Inuyasha handles its license quite well and offers some solid action -- especially for fans of the characters.   In its best move, Sorrent plays the strength of these characters by allowing you to play as both Inuyasha and his female companion, Kagome. (Hint: Beat the game to unlock more characters.) Inuyahsa excels at melee combat flurries while Kagome has a bow and arrow for ranged action. As soon as you meet Kagome, you can simply flick a soft action key to switch the two characters on the fly.   The game is stretched across three levels. Each level is fairly longish, but an experienced gamer shouldn't have a problem plowing through the game in an hour or so. The levels are mostly action-oriented, with either Inuyasha or his friend Kagome, engaging wave after wave of flailing foes. The constant button mashing is occasionally kept in check by some puzzle elements. These aren't exactly the game's strongest point -- most of the puzzles simply require you to switch out Inuyasha to use Kagome's greater range to flip far-off switches -- but some relief from the incessant onslaught is welcome.   Inuyasha is at its best, though, when it successfully mixes these two elements. There are moments when you must use Kagome to flip a switch, but then immediately switch back to Inuyasha to deliver deathblows to up-close enemies. Balancing close and ranged combat is a nice way to spice up what can sometimes become a tad monotonous. (When you finish the game, there will be an imprint of the ~OK~ button on the bottom of your thumb.)   True, combat is a big element of the source material, but there are a couple stretches where you feel like it's just a mad dash to hammer on the attack button. Inuyasha does have a special move arsenal -- using them depletes a meter on the bottom of the screen, next to your health meter. The special moves are so effective at dishing out one- or two-hit kills that you'll find yourself emptying out the meter before you know it, just because it's easier than rushing up to a bad guy and pounding on the basic attack. Special moves are acquired by collecting jewel shards dropped by defeated bosses.   Inuyasha's difficulty is a mixed bag. On our first attempt, we made it about halfway through the third level without losing a life. And then in the matter of a couple minutes, we lost all four remaining lives on a single puzzle scene. We had to leap across some spikes, but an enemy was always waiting for us on the other side. The enemy would knock us back into the spikes, and we would bleed out right on-screen. While things like that aren't dealbreakers, they are a little frustrating.   Inuyasha is a pretty solid-looking game. Sorrent is certainly capable of greater production values -- as we've seen now in Kingdom of Heaven -- but fans will certainly appreciate the presence of on-screen icons during dialogue scenes and in-game sprites that are unmistakable. The levels are decently detailed with some good variety, and the cherry blossoms are a very nice touch.Inuyasha is a solid action game, but it's certainly over too soon. After you pick up some special moves, you almost become too strong for the game's own good, as the one- or two-hit kills let you quickly accelerate through the latter stages of the game. I like that Inuyasha offers some classic beat-'em-up play, that's a genre that never seems to get old for older gamers (like moi) -- but let's face it, the cellphone thumbpad is no replacement for an NES pad. I think the combat wouldn't have grown a little monotonous if you had a little tighter control that allowed parrying at whatnot. Still, for fans of the manga and anime, Inuyasha is a no-brainer. It's an action-filled romp that treats the source material with great respect.", "date": "Mar 8, 2005"}
