First, it's hard to talk about the game without spoiling anything, something I'm going to attempt to avoid doing as much as possible. Secondly, trying to describe exactly what makes Shadow of the Colossus so fantastic is akin to trying to describe why the bodies of work of Picasso, Bach or Beethoven are unquestioned classics; you can do your best, but any of these examples must be experienced in full to truly be understood, and especially appreciated.  What isn't difficult, however, is stating that not only is Shadow of the Colossus an absolute must-play experience, but one of the most important games you'll come across anytime soon. Shadow is a true work of art, the likes of which we've only seen approached by a very, very small number of games. The closest thing that comes to mind is ICO, the studio's spiritual precursor to Shadow.The graphics in the remaster look a lot sharper. One thing that Shadow of the Colossus shares with ICO is its sense of solitude, one that overwhelms you with simultaneous feelings of calmness and despair. Whereas most games rely on scattering their environments with living and breathing creatures, intricate structures, various types of foliage and the like to bring their worlds to life, the near-complete lack of any of these in the world of Shadow of the Colossus forces you to essentially paint your own picture of how the world came to be as it is, why it is essentially a wasteland, or even a prison if you will, for the colossi that inhabit said land. In this, Shadow excels more so than possibly any title in the history of gaming. No game has done so much with so little, and no game has focused so much of its design and gambled so much of its experience on what essentially comes down to sixteen boss battles, the traveling to them between each fight and very little else.  But even with as simple a setup as this sounds, Shadow of the Colossus is an experience that is not to be missed. Shadow practically redefines the term ~cinematic~ in videogames, especially the sort where the player is in control during the entirety of the game.  At Whatever the CostYou begin the game with very little setup. You're seen traveling across the game's exterior world before arriving upon an enclosed wasteland, setting forth within its central castle - one of the game's few man-made interior environments - and placing a clearly deceased girl upon a pedestal. You're then given a voiceover that explains that the land you're in is a cursed one, forbidden for any living creature to enter. But, great power also lies within this land, including the power to restore life to the dead.  You're then given the ominous task to defeat each of the sixteen colossi that roam the land, after which your female companion may or may not actually be brought back to life - don't worry, this isn't a spoiler; you're told this at the outset. You're told that it ~may not be impossible~ for her to come back, and you're sent on your way. The setup is pretty cool in that you're told that things may not end up exactly as planned and that your loved one may or may not come back to life, giving you doubt as to whether the massive task you're about to set out on is worth it or not. Doubt apparently matters not though, as you're determined to do whatever it takes to bring her back, which helps install an even greater sense of purpose for your actions as the player. You want to bring her back to life not only to complete the game, but to figure out who she is, why she had her life taken from her, and why she's so very important to you.  From the start of the game, you're armed with your sword, a bow, your horse and the clothes on your back. As your sword is said to be the only thing in the world that is capable of taking down the colossi you're after, it's pretty evident from the get-go that your small inventory is all you'll ever need and likely ever have access to throughout the game. The game instills a great ~do with what you've got~ attitude, and as such rewards you with a greater sense of accomplishment as you never really receive any extraneous help from the game via new items or the like. It's simply you, the colossi and the world around you.  Colossal BattlesAs mentioned at the beginning of the review, it's hard to discuss many things that make Shadow of the Colossus great because most of said examples have to do with the various colossi themselves. You've likely seen - and via the demo, possibly beaten - the first colossus in the game. While he's pretty damn cool, he serves only as a very tiny appetizer for what the rest of the game has to offer.  While you'll have your favorites (mine are numbers seven and fifteen, while our Guides guru, Mark Ryan Sallee's, is number thirteen), there's little question that the game gets better and better as a whole as it progresses. Shadow of the Colossus constantly outdoes itself the whole way through. While one fight may make you wonder how things could get any cooler, the very next one will answer that question and turn things up a couple notches. By the time you reach the end of the game, you'll begin watching other people who have just started the game and shake your head, saying, ~If you think that's cool, just wait.~ The torture, though, is not being able to say anything more than that because anything else would ruin what is easily one of the most wondrous, rewarding and constantly wowing adventures you'll experience anywhere.  The first few colossi you'll fight are rather straightforward to beat; find some fur to dangle from, climb to their weak spot and stab away while you try and avoid being thrown from their convulsing and twitching masses. As you progress through the game though, the puzzle aspect of the game kicks into full gear and you'll first need to figure out how to even get onto each colossus, much less figure out where you need to begin impaling your sword into its vital spots. This part of the game is half the fun. Some of the monstrous beasts you'll encounter will require that you sprint full-speed on your horse alongside it and make a daring jump just to latch on. Others will be the opposite, where you'll have to ride for your life and wait for the opportune moment in order to strike. This brings us to a quick aside: your horse, Agro, who is also your only companion throughout the game, is nearly flawless in every aspect of his implementation. Firstly, his animation is absolutely phenomenal and easily one of the most realistically animated animals we've ever seen in a videogame. Secondly, he does a great job (for the most part) of finding his own path through an area. There are a couple small wooded areas in the game that he has problems with, running into trees and such if you're not careful to direct him around them, but he does an excellent job of navigating down winding paths on his own. Aside from having occasional problems with trees, his movement, reactions and general demeanor give him enough personality that, even though he doesn't talk, he becomes a great compatriot and even friend throughout your time through the game. Back to the colossi, the tactics that you'll need to use to defeat each of them are unique in and of themselves, separating each battle into its own individualized and standout section of the game. The end goal is always the same in that you'll need to find and stab each colossus in its vital area(s), but the fun is in getting there and hanging on, not to mention the sheer beauty in witnessing all of this. Just to mix things up, the game throws you a fair bit of curveballs that challenge what you think you know. Just when you think that every colossus' weak spot is on their head or at the highest point, you'll find out that this isn't the case. When you think that each and every colossus will get larger and larger and put the focus on simply climbing them, once again, you'll find out that this isn't the case. When you're used to using the environment to your advantage to defeat the colossi, things will all of a sudden become turned around and the environment will work against you and the colossus with it. And when you think you've seen everything there is to see, you'll quickly realize you haven't seen anything yet. When you've finally beaten all of the colossi, you'll be treated to an absolutely fantastic finale. Without spoiling anything, I must say that Shadow of the Colossus has one of the best ending sequences I've ever witnessed. The events that take place, what you'll see and, as general of a descriptor as this is it's absolutely true, what you'll experience is nothing short of phenomenal. When It's Over, It's Not Over But even when you're kicked back to the title screen, your journey is not over. Shadow has a whole boatload of things to do, collect and so forth after you've finished it off, including a hard mode, and you'll be immediately sucked back in. As you beat each colossus your strength will increase, and your accrued strength from the first time through will stick with you at the start of the second, allowing you to reach places you couldn't the first time around. In order to hunt down everything there is to find in the seemingly barren world, you'll actually need to finish the game more than once. And while you're working through the main story for the second or third time, by adventuring and completing other tasks you'll find a whole ton of other goodies to collect. So, while you might think you've seen everything there is to be seen after your first time through the game, think again.

A Visual and Aural Masterpiece While we generally say that graphics aren't important with regards to a game's overall enjoyment, Shadow of the Colossus proves that while we might be right about the technical side of that, pixel-perfect art direction can heighten an experience in ways that next-gen systems can only dream of. Shadow of the Colossus is a visual masterpiece in this regard. It doesn't have the best framerate we've ever seen - though it never actually hinders gameplay in any way - and the game's geometric detail isn't as high as some other lookers on the system, but its art direction is matched only by a very, very small number of games. The colossi themselves look stunning, both in terms of size and in terms of their design, with semblances of animals, machinery and god-like icons all mixed into one. Fur covers large areas of their bodies and rivals similar animalistic attempts on the Xbox. Their animation is phenomenal as it perfectly communicates not only the size but the weight of these creatures as well. LoadingPlayThe landscape is also breathtaking. Though much of the land you're in is made up of some sort of nearly-barren wasteland, be it rock, sand or simply dried earth, you'll also come across smaller segments of living and thriving plant life, like dense woods for example, giant waterfalls and more. It all blends together in such a natural manner that you'll never notice when you actually cross over from one terrain type to another, further implying that this land was once full of life but has now mostly become a desolate wasteland, with only pockets of life left in it. Sound effects don't really make up much of the game's audio track, though what's there - like Agro's hoofs beating against the lay of the land or your feet scrambling over segments of rock - all sound great. The game's soundtrack is absolutely stellar, with passages that remind of us tunes that we usually only associate with epic movies or RPGs. The soundtrack perfectly matches with the tone of each battle, with the first being somewhat upbeat as you can basically have your way with the first colossus, while the last is something much more downtrodden and somber in tone, with each track in-between blending the ends together in a very natural manner. Will Everyone Appreciate It? Shadow of the Colossus is one of those rare games that most everyone can appreciate in some fashion, but may not quite be everyone's cup of tea in the end. It's not as action-oriented as something like God of War, though it's easily its equal in terms of presentation and art direction. And while Shadow may not have the namesake or be as directly relatable as a Grand Theft Auto title, it easily trumps them in terms of the emotional experiences you'll take from it. Really, if you look at it from a very fact-based standpoint then the game doesn't break down into much more than climbing a giant creature and stabbing it repeatedly until it's dead. But when you stand back and take in the game as a whole, it excels in virtually every way possible. It's not that Shadow of the Colossus isn't something that any gamer who is interested in it will enjoy, because they will, and thoroughly so, but it might not be one of those titles you can pass off to your ADD-suffering little cousin. But not every game is made for the Ritalin generation, Shadow of the Colossus being one of them. In fact, it's a game that rewards you for taking a chance and seeking out new experiences, and in these ways and what it'll give back to you for doing so, it's a phenomenal success.Shadow of the Colossus is easily one of my favorite games on the PlayStation 2 and ranks highly among my favorites on any system. It is a true masterpiece in terms of art direction and, dare I say, cinematography. From the fights with the colossi to exploring the world to basically just standing back and letting it all soak in, Shadow of the Colossus is an amazing experience and an absolute must-have title.", "date": "Oct 17, 2005"}
