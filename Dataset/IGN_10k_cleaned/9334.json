The cute little dog and kitty on the cover, the flowery language and the intentionally misspelled, extra-adorable title of Puppy Luv: Spa and Resort would have you believe that this game is casual, and slow-paced, and probably some kind of virtual pet experience. But as it turns out, it's none of those things  it's much more hardcore than that. This DS title, expertly veiled in a huggable package, is actually a brisk, demanding simulation/strategy game. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing.   Luckily, it's a pretty entertaining wolf. Though you certainly wouldn't expect it going in, Puppy Luv is an engaging sim experience that positions you as the proud proprietor of a puppy-pampering penthouse property, and tasks you to turn a profit as quickly as possible from the many pretty pets that prance in through the front door. It's unique in the sense that Puppy Luv is closer to a Dog Salon Tycoon game, rather than a virtual pet title.   Puppy Luv is fairly fast-paced, too.  You're only given a short amount of time to start making money, as the clock counts down immediately after you start off in any level. To begin, you're given a hotel property. There are several floors of empty rooms, and you can purchase these rooms, for a fee, and transform them into hotel suites suitable for dogs and cats. There are low-level rooms to construct that only cost $100 a piece, but then will also only bring in that small amount in rent from animal tenants. To make more dough, you'll need to upgrade the accommodations into five-star luxury apartments.   Meow.  Now, the animals who come by and check in to your hotel rooms want to be pampered. If you just let them sit in their rooms and don't attend to their needs, they won't check out, and that means you're missing other potential customers because of your lack of vacancy. So, to meet the needs of your cat and canine clients, you can also transform other empty rooms in the hotel into feeding, grooming and bathing stations. Playing Puppy Luv ends up being a strategizing dance between building new rooms, tending to the needs of current customers, and watching the clock to make sure you're collecting enough rent money from guests to cover your daily maintenance expenses  if you ever hit zero dollars in your bank account, it's game over.    The core action is fast and pretty fun, but plays out a lot like a Game Boy Advance game would. And, expectedly, there's another version of this game on the GBA that probably does just that. Where the DS system's unique features come in is with V.I.P. guests. The Very Important Pets demand that you yourself handle their needs, instead of just sending them off to a salon station like the normal, average customers. And taking care of them yourself means you'll be needing your stylus.   There are three different touch screen mini-games  one apiece for feeding, grooming and bathing. Feeding is the simplest, with you guiding a portion meter up and down the screen for five different food types to guess how much of each different dish your current pet will prefer. It's like playing the Price is Right's Clock Game, as you guess more, and then less, and then ultimately hit the exact right amount of beef, or chicken, or fish that your hungry animal desires. It's a basic implementation, but not bad.   Grooming is the most manic, as you're there called upon to tap and destroy a soaring squadron of flying fleas that leap into the air from your dog or cat's back. Quelling the infestation takes speed and accuracy, but you shouldn't have too much trouble squishing them all before time runs out. And Bathing is the most virtual pet-esque part of this whole Puppy Luv package, as you scrub the pets' dirty fur coats with the stylus and then blow into the DS microphone to send the soap suds away.   So the contents of Puppy Luv are solidly executed. The core design of managing your property and juggling your clients' needs is done well, and the V.I.P. mini-games serve to break up the action and keep things from getting monotonous. The lowpoint, though, after all this  depth: There's not a lot of it. After you clear early levels, you'll move on to more advanced hotel properties, with more floors and more demanding budgets to have to balance. But you never end up accessing any different mini-games, and the clientele you're keeping ends up repeating itself over and over again.   For example, there are only two designs of V.I.P. animals: one type of dog, and one type of cat. The colors on these creatures are swapped out, and they're given different generic pet names like Blackie and Simba, but it's always the same two animals you see again and again. The art style, which employs a clean, crisp lineart look, is attractive, but it's repetitive to wash the same bulldog fifteen times in a row, even if he changed his dogtag to read Fido instead of Spot.Puppy Luv: Spa and Resort is one of those pleasant, unexpected surprises. Though you'd guess you're getting another too-cute virtual pet game based on the branding and package art, it's really a fast-paced and fairly addictive simulation/strategy design that fans of those genres, and puzzle games, might want to check out. The design could have done even more to break away from its GBA roots, and some earnable unlockables, alternate animal artwork or additional V.I.P. mini-games could have extended its lasting appeal. Don't be fooled by the cover on this one, friends. It's worth another look.", "date": "Oct 26, 2007"}
