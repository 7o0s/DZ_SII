Let us not allow this sin to keep on keepin' on by downloading the fella anew, bringing the rascal out of retirement. After all, how could we turn our collective backs on a chap that willing crashland's into a cow's kiester for our amusement?   In Does Texas, Johnny riles the locals by performing increasingly stupid stunts in their backyards with a little help from you. You blast Johnny out of a cannon and control his altitude, steering him into various obstacles, like storm clouds, cacti, clotheslines, tornados, and the aforementioned heifer nether-regions. You only have so much juice to keep Johnny afloat, so you must be judicious with holding down OK (Johnny's a one-button kinda guy) to propel him farther into the sky. If you send Johnny soaring too high, he'll stall and plummet to the dirt, robbing you of points.   There are only twelve missions, so Johnny's adventure isn't exactly Texas-sized. However, you'll find yourself replaying many of the stunts for a higher score since a single goof-filled run only takes about a minute or so of your time. Let's be brutally honest here, this is a perfect game for playing in the bathroom -- Johnny will send you back to your cubicle with a smile on your face.   Johnny's Texas adventure came straight outta 2005, but it doesn't look remotely dated -- especially when stuff like Bungee Desperado makes it to the deck. Johnny's an expressive bugger, flying through the air with a devil may care face (often seen in close-up snapshots when you plow into an obstacle).  Johnny Crash Does Texas may be a little long in the tooth, but time doesn't dull this game's sharp sense of humor and easy-breezy gameplay. If Johnny's still hanging around your carrier's deck, definitely give him a look-see.", "date": "May 2, 2007"}
