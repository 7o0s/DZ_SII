{"name": "Nightmare Creatures", "name_review": "Nightmare Creatures", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/01/nightmare-creatures-2", "text": ", originally a PlayStation game, has made its way to Nintendo 64 courtesy of Kalisto Entertainment and Activision. Incidentally, the game marks Activision's first foray into the Nintendo 64 market and also serves as one of the console's most moody, violent games to date. And it should be said that, despite a few minor upgrades here and there, Nightmare Creatures (64) plays and looks very similar to its PlayStation predecessor. But is that a good or bad thing?  The Facts  16 dark, Gothic-style levels. Two playable characters. A wide selection of in-game weapons. Fighting combo system. Multiple environments and effects: fog, rain, snow, wind, lightning, dynamic light-sourcing and transparency routines.  Buckets of blood and violence.   Story It's really quite simple. Nightmare Creatures takes players back to London in the year of 1834. The Brotherhood of Hecate has rediscovered ~the lost key to the darkest regions of a man's unholiest fears.~ After the Brotherhood's leader Adam Crowley, an evil scientist gone mad, unleashes an unspeakable evil upon the city, townspeople begin changing into demonic beasts and grizzly mutations. Horror sweeps through London.   It's up to two brave heroes, Father Ignatius Blackward and immunology expert Nadia F, to restore order to the troubled, fouled land.  Gameplay Those familiar with the PlayStation version of Nightmare Creatures probably have a good idea what to expect from the game's 64-bit transition. Very little has been changed. After choosing either Ignatius or Nadia, players begin the game armed with only one weapon and a host of skills. The first levels pits do-gooders in a dark, foggy London infested with the walking dead and werewolf-esque monsters, among other evil baddies. Employing a third-person view similar to Tomb Raider, or, if you will, Zelda, Nightmare Creatures moves along at a comparatively quick pace. Additionally, the game plays a bit like a cross between a super-charged Lara Croft title and a fighter, enabling players the option of executing satisfying combo hits for maximum enemy damage.   It works something like this: Players using Ignatius begin the game with a standard staff -- or a sword with Nadia. And it should be noted that both characters control differently and feature their own strengths and weaknesses. Pressing B swings the staff at enemies and does minimal damage. Rotating between B and A, on the other hand, delivers a significantly more powerful blow that is likely to send body parts flying. And if that's not enough, pressing both B and A simultaneously results in a furious attack that turns enemies into a quivering, bloody pulp. It's extremely fun, believe or not, and just as strategic as it is satisfying.   The selection of weapons, potions and the like in the game is commendable. There are pistols, burst guns, fire bombs, mines, freezes, berzerkers and confusion spells. Everything works great, seems balanced, and most of the arsenal has the potential to spill lots of blood.  However, the game isn't without an arsenal of problems, many of which can be blamed on its PlayStation ancestry. Characters move extremely fast, stiff and feel very ~digital.~ What we mean by this is that, despite the addition of analog support for the Nintendo 64 version, characters hardly control with any precision, but rather seem to jump from place to place in spurts. The results can be frustrating, especially when trying to flip a switch or pick up items. That said, overall everything does feel improved over the PlayStation version. Still, a little more tweaking could have gone a long way.  Another problem with the game is its infuriating camera system. Players often find themselves facing the wrong direction, stuck behind a wall, or unable to properly face an enemy -- and most of the time it's the camera's fault. Whereas Zelda and, to a certain extent, even Banjo-Kazooie, feature finely tuned camera systems that scroll smoothly overhead a character, Nightmare Creature's camera is often spastically jerking from side to side in an effort to keep up with the game's fast style.   Don't get the wrong impression: Nightmare Creatures (64) is completely playable, and, for the most part, it's very enjoyable. But had a few minor annoyances been tuned -- annoyances like the camera system -- this game could have been much better than it is.  Graphics We were surprised to see that the Nintendo 64 version of Nightmare Creatures looks crisp, clear and detailed. But best of all, the PlayStation pixelization and texture-warping of old is gone. The game's overall look is extremely dark, foggy (for ambience purposes mostly), and extraordinarily Gothic. Characters, as before, animate stiffly and monsters are huge, though a little obscure.   And the game is gory. Limbs fly in every direction, blood erupts out of open wounds in fountains, heads roll and bodies are literally ripped apart. It's a welcomed change from the Nintendo 64 norm. Those of us who have a hunger for this primitive form of entertainment, and damn it we all do, are likely to find themselves trying out new combos on enemies just to watch the sick aftermath.   Sound Moody and ambient. Nothing spectacular is going on in the sound department music-wise, but the game reveals growls, moans and other eerie effects around each corner and scary organ sounds abound. If nothing else, the theme fits the game perfectly and it's highly likely to keep players on their toes. Nothing particular special, but it works. Nightmare Creatures (64) is well-executed conversion of the PlayStation original. The game is extremely moody and gory if not downright eerie. The theme is a refreshing change from the usual 64-bit selection and it's a third-person action-fighter, which in itself is a novelty for the console. Had this game arrived last year and had we not already played it for PlayStation, I would have no doubt enjoyed it quite a bit more. As it stands, it's still a solid N64 title that, unfortunately, has its share of camera and control frustrations. A good entry from Activision. Now, how about some N64 exclusives?", "date": "Dec 1, 1998"}
