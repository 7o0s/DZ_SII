Activision made a wise decision to rename the game for its North American release, as any true fan of the little white bomber dude knows all too well that this Bomberman franchise is all about the multiplayer Battle Mode. Anything else Hudson offers in the series is purely trivial in comparison.  Features Eight multiplayer maps 200 room Adventure mode 10 different weapons Battery save Link cable support for four players Single cartridge and Multi-cartridge link support Only for Game Boy Advance  Bomberman Tournament does feature a RPG-style Quest Mode that's there to provide an added incentive to play the game for those that prefer to play their games all alone, but it's far from a feature that makes the game worth owning. The story is pretty simple -- as Bomberman, players must investigate the planet Phantarion after Bomberman Max disappears while on his mission to investigate the planet after a meteor strike. It's not necessarily bad, but there's nothing in the game's storyline that's overly exciting.   Likewise, the basic gameplay isn't something to write home about as it's strikingly similar to Nintendo's Pokemon games as you can find and collect these different creatures called Karabons that are based on elements like earth, fire, water and electricity, but not quite as deep or endearing. You can do things like fuse two Karabons together to create new ones and this is tied neatly into gameplay as you'll encounter many instances where you must create a specific Karabon to get past a puzzle. The problem is that these creatures, while very cute, don't quite have the charisma that'll make kids go crazy over them.   The battle system is another important aspect of any role-playing game and is yet another area where Bomberman Tournament's Quest Mode isn't overly exciting. The battles are turn-based one-on-one matches between two Karabons that last three rounds and have the player decide on the battle strategies at the beginning of each match.   Players are required to pick the strategies, which consist of a combination of block, punch and special commands, for each of the three rounds and then watch the battles unfold. There's some strategy involved as Karabons of certain attributes will perform better or worse depending on the attributes of the opponent, so you'll need to know this in order to decide on what kinds of attacks to do, but the complete hands-off approach of the three rounds is a little bit disappointing.   The game also suffers a bit from the way the ~bombing~ aspect has been implemented, as you must constantly lay down bombs to destroy things and open up paths. What's wrong here is that this becomes a somewhat tedious task because of the delay between when the bombs are set and when they explode. Since you have to do so much of this just to make it through each maze and even more to blow up bushes to try and find the Karabon shields to power up your creatures, it's more of a test of your patience than anything else. So, what you're getting here is a very mediocre RPG that isn't really worth picking up unless you simply must have a new adventure game for Game Boy Advance.   Luckily, the Quest Mode is just a small part of the game and in no way hurts the product's worth because the meat and bones of the game, which is the Battle Mode, is done so very well. With a single Bomberman Tournament cartridge, you can Link with up to four players for some of the best multiplayer gaming that you'll likely ever experience with your GBA. The only downside to the one-cart, four-GBA setup is that you'll have to deal with a tremendous amount of load time at the start of each contest, before the victory screen and before the start of the next battle.   This is only a minor annoyance, though, and can be remedied a lot if you happen to have a friend or more that also has a copy of the game. Regardless, the fun of the multiplayer Battle Mode and the low cost of setting up four-player matches is well worth the extra load times.   The Battle Mode is completely customizable and has just about all of the features that fans of the classic series have grown to love. You'll find all of the classic power-ups like the Fire Up to increase the blast radius of your bombs, Bomb Up to increase the number of bombs you can set at one time, Kick Bomb that allows you to kick bombs, and the ever-popular Power Glove that gives you the ability to pick up and toss bombs in the game.   You also have the option to play on any one of the eight different battlefields that each provides their own obstacles that will change the strategy of the way you must approach the game. Plus, there are options to play with the Revenge or Super Revenge options on or off. With the Revenge mode turned on, players that get killed get to fling bombs onto the surviving players from the sideline and with the Super Revenge killed players can get put back into the game if they manage to kill one of the surviving characters.   Some longtime fans have been against the Revenge option, but it solves the problem of players feeling left out if they happen to screw up early in a match and accidentally kill themselves. Additionally, the added bonus of being able to get put back into the contest if you can kill one of the survivors with the Super Revenge mode makes things even more exciting for all the players involved.   What's more, even if you're all by yourself, Bomberman Tournament's Battle Mode is still highly enjoyable to play and will serve as a great time killer whether on the bus to school or taking a train ride into work. It's clearly not as fun to play against a computer as it is to play another human, but the CPU puts up a great challenge and the single player Battle Mode is a hundred times more enjoyable than the game's very mediocre Quest Mode.Simply put, Bomberman is one of the greatest multiplayer game franchises of all time and Bomberman Tournament for GBA does its heritage complete justice and is a must-own game for fans of the series and for those looking for a great multiplayer game for their newly bought handheld system. So, please excuse me while I get my Bomberman on.", "date": "Jul 6, 2001"}
