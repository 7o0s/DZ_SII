Konami's been pretty well respected in the Game Boy community,  as most of the company's portable titles have been above average and better. Games like Metal Gear Solid, Blades of Steel, International Track & Field, and even The Grinch coming up this month are quality handheld titles that make Konami look good as a third-party Game Boy Color publisher. But then Airforce Delta hits the shelves -- as impressive as a game can look, if there's not much to do and relatively no variety or payoff in the design, there's really no point in playing the game. And that's what this game is -- all glitz, no guts.  Features Eight different aircraft 10 missions Link cable support Only for Game Boy Color Airforce Delta is based on a Dreamcast game of the same name. Naturally, to expect a game that looks like that title on the Game Boy Color would be completely insane, but it's very intriguing to wonder how Konami expected a developer to produce a game of similar caliber on the 8-bit handheld.  Enter Climax, the same development team responsible for the outstanding Blades of Steel conversion for the Game Boy Color. This talented studio was given the challenge to produce the air combat game for the portable, and what they produced was a game that had a great (for the GBC) graphics engine, but not much room for variety.  The game is very reminiscent of Blue Lightning on the Atari Lynx,  flying in a behind-the-craft perspective over aggressive, unfriendly terrain. The Game Boy Color doesn't really have the hardware power to push lots of sprites in a semi-3D perspective, but Climax created an impressive graphics engine to actually scale the sprites as they approach your craft. At least, that's what it looks like -- most games that offer this perspective redraw sprites at different sizes to simulate them approaching, but in this case I believe that advanced scaling tricks are used here to provide the effect. And for a Game Boy Color game, that's mighty impressive. On top of this, the game features extensive use of the Game Boy Color's hi-color mode for the mission scenes and menu options, as well as huge boss craft in a few missions that you'll have to take down. As graphics go, Climax did wonders.  But then we actually get into the game design portion. In this case, there's really not much to Airforce Delta. The game breaks the levels down into missions, offering the illusion that there's plenty to do -- but it all just boils down to wasting air targets, wasting land targets, and collecting power-ups to stay alive. That's the gist of the entire game -- you have no control over your speed, and you can't crash into the ground or ground targets. It's all about shooting your unlimited machine guns and targeting enemies with your missiles, all the while avoiding missiles that'll damage your ship. It's a design that gets extremely monotonous early on -- the designers tried to shake up the variety by offering other aircraft to purchase and control, but the game doesn't change enough to make this worthwhile.  To its credit, the game does have a link-cable mode, but even here it doesn't seem worth it. Two players hop in the same choice of planes and fly in the same arena, but you never see the other person or his bullets. When one person shoots down a target, it explodes on both systems, so the challenge is to shoot down the targets before the other person does. It's a half-baked attempt at multiplayer gaming, and it doesn't add any fun to an already dull game.  The graphics are all I can say positive about the game, for Climax developed a great engine but failed to attach a good game to it. The game is colorful, smooth, and impressive in looks, but when you wrap your hands around a system and actually play it, that's when the snoozefest begins. You can only stand flying up and down, pummeling craft with machine guns and rockets for so long...the tedium sets in quickly. This air combat game runs out of fuel after the first couple missions.", "date": "Nov 9, 2000"}
