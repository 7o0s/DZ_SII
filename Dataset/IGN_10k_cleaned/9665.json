Thanks to UK developer Software Creations, the search for baby Dil, based on the successful animated movie, arrives on Nintendo's little one with both Game Boy Color and Super Game Boy support.  Features  Single-player game. Based on the animated feature. Password saving. Compatible with Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Super Game Boy. GBC-only bonus levels.   The Game Considering the young skew of the license, it's no surprise that Rugrats Movie is aimed primarily at younger Game Boy players. Most of the game is played from a 2D sidescrolling perspective, with the occasional overhead driving sequence thrown in for variety. Don't expect complex controls or mind-numbing puzzles. Rugrats, which uses only one button (jump) in addition to D-Pad control, is all about letting Rugrats fans explore levels based on their favorite movie and jumping from place to place. Look for all the traditional sidescroller stuff, including bonus items, timed hazards and bouncy surfaces.  Graphically, Rugrats stays true to the series with large, recognizable characters and decent animation. The scrolling still needs some work, but Creations pulled off a slew of vibrant, nicely drawn backgrounds that really shine on the Game Boy Color or Super Game Boy. Sound effects are sparse, but the memorable Rugrats music would quickly overshadow any potential sounds anyway. But remember: Enjoy Rugrats music only in small doses. If you're planning to play the game for a long time, we suggest switching off the music to prevent yourself from going nuts.  There's little here to hold the attention of older gamers, but kids will love the easy gameplay, recognizable characters and memorable Rugrats tunes. Don't expect anything new  this game is definitely carried by its license. Unless you're looking for something to entertain and challenge at the same time, parents can't go wrong in buying the game for their kids.", "date": "Jul 15, 1999"}
