You can absolutely go wrong with Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts. I'm not going to claim that this game is awful, because that'd be an overstatement. Rather, Dungeon Explorer is a completely mediocre game that just barely scrapes and claws its way into the passable realm with at least a few functioning RPG elements. Otherwise, this UMD is filled with hours of bland hacking and slashing set in an entirely uninspired world. Those of you looking to stir the nostalgia that the original Dungeon Explorer invokes may want to reconsider grabbing this one -- it's a long and laborious ride.   Warriors of the Ancient Arts is, not surprisingly, a dungeon crawler that encourages you to fight waves of demons in the name of three uneasy kingdoms. After a poorly translated/poorly written opening sequence, you're taken right to the character creation screen where you can select your warrior's race, gender, class, color, attributes and assign him or her a name. Although there have certainly been more robust creation systems, your choices are somewhat varied and the classes are interesting enough. You can pick from the human-like Izark, the elf-like Ist and the reptilian orcs known as Olff.    In regards to classes, you have a handful of options: Fighter, Hunter, Monk, Thief, Shaman and Bishop. Although each class has a slightly different feel, the overall gameplay mechanics are so dull that all the character types begin to blend together into one apathetic mess.   Below average gameplay can sometimes be supplemented by a phenomenal story, but that's not the case with Dungeon Explorer. Not only does the game's narrative lack any real poignancy, it's also borderline unintelligible thanks to sketchy text and a disorganized cast of characters.   Glyphs galore. Things actually made more sense to me after I started a character from each of the three races, because all three start in different locations and provide slightly different perspectives. However, each journey starts in just about the same way: the sorcerer Deldren urges the King to supply him with resources and two able-bodied adventures so he can place a seal on a nearby dungeon. The dungeon is a veritable breeding ground for monsters and has become a threat to the wellbeing of the kingdom. Well, you're one of those adventurers and thus your journey begins.   The majority of the game is spent running between the town hub and the dungeon. That's really all there is to it. You buy supplies and sign up for quests in town and then lead your eager team of four (or less) into the dark depths, hoping to not only slay some foul beasts but also make a pretty penny in the process.   Warriors of Ancient Arts does have a few positive elements. Some of the character models have a bit of detail to them, which is nice to see in a PSP game. More importantly though: Dungeon Explorer has a solid, elaborate RPG mechanic built into the gameplay. Your character has plenty of stats to consider and is fully capable of equipping all sorts of items, gaining skills and building levels. There's always an intrinsic sting of satisfaction when you level up your warrior, but that just comes with the reward of playing an RPG.     The primary issues that plague Dungeon Explorer inhabit the gameplay outside of these standard RPG elements. Despite the number of skills you acquire, battle always seems to return to the mundane hacking and slashing that pesters so many dungeon crawlers. I just wasn't enjoying the experience, even with the promise of level-building looming over my head. Furthermore, aiming with a long range weapon is inaccurate and any computer-controlled characters in your party seem to be consistently slaughtered by the dungeon bosses, even when you set the party strategy to ~Recover~ so they take better care of themselves.   And it doesn't help that the menu and organizational systems are hugely unintuitive, making item management a colossal pain.    If you don't feel like tackling these dungeons on your own, there are a few multiplayer aspects to try. If you're the only one with a copy of the game, you can send it to two other friends and jump into a trial version with pre-made characters. The bulk of the multiplayer, however, comes from having multiple copies of the game.   You and up to two friends can use a particular location in the game (the Rift) to team up your created characters and explore any dungeon available to the host of the party. This is certainly a nice feature for those interested in multiplayer modes, but I'm curious as to why you can only have a party of three during a multiplayer session when you can have up to four throughout the single-player campaign.   Multiplayer runs perfectly fine, as far as I can tell. This mode definitely enhances the game, but unfortunately you can't gain experience during Rift Multiplayer -- you can only collect items. Of course, this is assuming you actually enjoyed the single-player campaign, which is questionable.   It's all about the berries. Dungeon Explorer: Warriors of Ancient Arts isn't a broken game, it's just boring and unoriginal. However, the thorough character stats and the wealth of dungeons to plunder make this title a little more than just tolerable. I'm hesitant to recommend this to anyone, but if you're hardcore about dungeon crawling and you want a portable game to pass the time, I suppose this might float your boat. After all, it does have a charming blue-skinned elf girl with glasses. It's tough to say no to that, right?", "date": "Feb 15, 2008"}
