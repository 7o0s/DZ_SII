{"name": "CellFactor", "name_review": "CellFactor: Revolution Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/23/cellfactor-revolution-review", "text": "The majority of the reviews on IGN are used by you, the consumer, for one reason: to read about whether or not a game is worth buying. CellFactor: Revolution is a free game, a sort of advertisement for the Ageia PhysX card, a rather pricey piece of hardware dedicated solely to physics processing. You don't actually need the card to play, but if you don't have it you'll miss out on a bunch of fancy effects. Since it's free, no matter how much we dislike the game, it's probably worth checking out just to see debris stuff fly around. The real question, however, is whether the PhysX card is worth buying for the sole purpose of playing Cell Factor. In response, we can answer with a definite no.   So there you go, issue resolved.   In case you're unfamiliar with the game, CellFactor: Revolution is an arena first-person shooter that lets you use bits of the environment as lethal weapons with special psi powers. Before jumping into a match you pick between three classes: the dual-wielding Guardian, hybrid Black Op, or psionically proficient Bishop. Each class has a few useful skills, like the Guardian's super jump, Black Ops' gravity bomb, and the Bishop's ability to part large masses of objects at high speeds, knocking out any living thing in the way. The Bishop is particularly interesting because she can fly, pick up foes, and quickly crush them to death.    Using these kinds of skills in rapid succession can definitely be entertaining, but there's a problem with depth. While you can grab a guy and throw him into a lava pit, fling around gigantic cranes, and set deadly particle beams aflutter, CellFactor lacks a cohesiveness it seems like it should have. It certainly looks good, and the range of things you can do seems like it would keep the game entertaining. Yet after fifteen minutes, you're probably going to want to shut this one down. Testing each skill is like window shopping at a jewelry store. You see the baubles sparkle, appreciate their beauty, then move on. We were told this game has a story, yet there's no indication of its existence while playing through. As each class type you can wade through five missions to unlock new skills or head into a skirmish or LAN match with every skill already unlocked.   With only LAN support you're going to be spending a majority of the time playing against the CellFactor bots. At the highest difficulty these guys show sparks of intelligence, but we experience more instances of them being boring and annoying. They're boring when teammates or enemies run around in circles for no apparent reason during a CTF match. They're annoying when they kill you from all the way across the map with a machine gun, or a Bishop repeatedly performs an extremely difficult to avoid grab and crush maneuver. Many times we were shooting them at point blank range and saw no noticable reaction, aside from them dying. They seem to behave much better in Deathmatch than team games, using abilities like side dashes to avoid fire.    Surprisingly, it's the game's most prominent feature - the physics - that make playing such a tedious affair. Because there's so much crap flying around the screen, you'll often spawn only to die within two seconds as a result of unavoidable flying junk. Sure it looks cool, but it's really difficult to enjoy a first-person arena shooting where the mechanics of life and death feel so randomized. One round you might get 20 kills without dying. The next you'll play just as well, but die 20 times while racking up only five kills. It's just a matter of where you're standing and how many metal boxes / larger metal boxes happen to smack into the side of your head   Vehicles are in the game too, but only Black Ops can pilot them. None of the five maps are really built to accommodate vehicles, and on top of that it's really easy to disable them with rockets, grenades, or psi blasts. That being said, using a Goliath walker on Proving Grounds seems really unbalanced, since that thing can mow down at least ten people before keeling over. Though psionic attacks can stir up quite a bit of deadly chaos, the guns, of which there are several types, are powerful too. The problem is they don't have a distinct feel. It's not like in Counter-Strike when you pick up the M4 and you know exactly how you need to handle it, and how that differs from nabbing a UMP or AK. In CellFactor you get to choose rifles of the assault and sniper variety, as well as a rocket launcher. There's a generic pistol as well. None of them are fun to play around with because none of them make you feel like you're firing a weapon. There's barely any recoil on any gun, the assault rifle sounds like wooden spoons hammering on cardboard; it feels fake, even for a video game. It's like you keep trying to grab hold of something enjoyable with this game but it's covered with oil.If there's any reason to play this game, it's to hear the in-game announcer. Killing anyone with flying boxes or psi-crush moves counts as a PhysX kill, which the announcer enthusiastically screams. Now imagine ~PhysX kill~ being yelled with a cadence as laughably bad as Howard Dean's fateful rallying cries at the 2004 Iowa Democratic caucuses. Sound fun? Oh, and the game runs terribly. We're told it's optimized for dual core processors. Still, even with the PhysX sharing a burden of the calculations, we often found ourselves staring at a slide show. Go ahead and download it just for fun, but don't expect any kind of lasting entertainment, and don't bother with the PhysX upgrade specifically for Cell Factor.", "date": "May 23, 2007"}
