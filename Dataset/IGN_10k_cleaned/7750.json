Forget Mario and Luigi. Forget Samus and Ridley. Forget Pikachu and pals. The one game series that has consistently played the strongest hands and garnered virtually universal praise time and time again has been the Legend of Zelda titles. It almost goes without saying that expectations for Twilight Princess, the much-demanded, mature-themed, spiritual-sequel to Ocarina of Time, are enormous. How could it ever possibly hold a candle to a game hailed by many as the finest ever? Well, friends, it does. Arguably, it goes beyond the high-gloss quality of Ocarina and hits highs that few games ever have before. As a game, Twilight betters Ocarina's gameplay in very nearly every department -from controls to dialogue, from scope to score. But does it top the overall experience?   For those who wish to avoid all possible spoilers (and we can't blame you), feel free to glance at the score and then skip to the last page for our score breakdown. We don't mind. For everyone else, we'll endeavour to keep main plot points well and truly out of the review. We hate having great games deflated before our eyes as much as you do.   Let's dive into the basics. How well-suited to the Wii remote is Zelda's traditionally complex control scheme? The short and thankfully cheerful answer is, very. In the same way that the Nintendo 64's three-pronged controller was a delight to use for games like Mario 64 and Ocarina, the button layout on the wiimote is a natural fit for the series. Assigning items to the D-pad's left, right and down directions allows easy access for the player's thumb, which sits just below this, over the A button. The underside of the wiimote - the B-trigger - is also an assignable slot for items, and is used for activating your chosen item or tool. Again, it's a natural fit, since using items like the bow and arrow or the claw shot (effectively, the hook shot) requires you to aim at the screen and pull the trigger to fire.   The first time you step foot into Hyrule field, prepare to be overwhelmed by the size. Then stop and look at your map. It's a tiny portion.  On the subject of items, and perhaps more specifically, item interface as a whole, pressing + brings up one of three sub-screens. This screen shows your major character information, such as what sword and shield you have equipped, your tunic, heart pieces and key quest or sub-quest items you have in your inventory. On this screen you can also choose to view your records for fish caught and bugs collected. At the base of the screen is the save option - allowing for up to four different files. Pressing - (minus) brings up a radial menu of all your useable gear that can be assigned to the points of the D-pad. Some items, such as bombs, can be linked to the bow and arrow with a tap of Z. The 1 and 2 buttons deal with viewing the map and hiding the map on the play screen respectively.   Link's auto-jump mechanic returns, and it feels a little tighter and more sensitive. Approaching an edge at speed will cause Link to leap across the ledge. Simple. Approach a box, wall or object of head height or smaller, and link will automatically pull himself up. Such context-sensitive controls work flawlessly. Also improved is Link's roll-attack, which now features the ability to adjust the course of his roll, mid-movement.     The nunchuk, the wiimote's sister-attachment, houses the control stick, C and Z buttons. C allows you to enter first-person mode - a must for studying dungeon layouts or just marvelling at the gorgeous land of Hyrule from high above Kakariko village. The Z button marks the much-needed return of Z-targeting. Holding down Z (or setting it to 'switch on/off' mode in the options menu) targets the nearest enemy, allowing you to proceed with the slicing, dicing, arrow-piercing and, in the case of friendly Hylian residents, speaking from afar.   Added late in the development cycle at the behest of Shigeru Miyamoto himself, the wiimote itself replaces the need to assign the sword to a button. Instead, the wiimote can be gently swung left and right or up and down to simulate the motion of Link's attack. Link's trademark spin-attach is unleashed with a side-to-side flick of the nunchuk. Pleasingly, all of this is perfectly implemented. No dramatic movements are required to swing the sword - just a gentle flick of the wrist is all it takes. We're relieved that the mechanic doesn't grow tiresome, even after marathon sessions with the game.   It's no secret, at this point, that Link journeys into the Twilight Realm with his mysterious feline-hominoid-female-critter companion, Midna. During his time in this realm, he is transformed into a sleek, grey wolf. With the exception of his inability to use items, Link's human moves have wolf equivalents and are activated in the same manner.   Kakariko village is devoid of greenery; yet it still sits at the base of Death Mountain. The town is a playground of passages.  However, being in a semi-spiritual realm, wolf-link is imbued with the mystical ability to see through the ether and view spirits inhabiting the world. While in this view, he can also 'sense' scents of key characters and find hidden items or entrances under the ground. It also becomes a key skill when the game asks you to find 'tears of light' - pure light-energy that has been stolen by special invisible bugs. In order to find them (and satisfy the requests made of you by three spirits of light), you must make full use of this inherent ability and go on a scavenger hunt of sorts - which effectively gives you an opportunity to explore certain parts of the world before you even tackle your first dungeon.   And exploration is what a Zelda game is all about. Even beyond dungeon-crawling and puzzle-solving, the core of each Zelda game has always been about trekking the rolling hills of Hyrule, diving into deep, uncharted waters for the possibility of a heart piece (or golden insect, which is Twilight Princess' Gold Skulltula-equivalent) or secret grotto. Experimentation with items and taking leaps of faith are encouraged not punished.   In true Zelda style, you must work your way through the main game's plot in order to access key equipment needed to unlock the segmented world. Hyrule has never been larger than in Twilight Princess. The overworld is truly enormous, and the scale isn't really apparent until you've unlocked the entire world, hopped off of Epona for a minute, and just stood looking across to the horizon. A single open field area in Twilight Princess' overworld is easily larger than the whole of Ocarina's overworld. And there are a good six-or-so major areas linked together via valleys and canals in Twilight Princess. Each is littered with caves to explore, trees to roll into and curious characters to encounter. Sub-quests are numerous and varied, as in past titles. Item collecting, trading, escort missions and even a very cool Panzer Dragoon-style wyvern-flight mini-game give plenty of opportunities to break away from the main plot.    Twilight Princess is perhaps most accurately viewed as a darker re-imagining of Ocarina of Time. The series assumes that the land of Hyrule has several key areas that should exist in every game - those include many from Ocarina. Some could argue that the game retreads past efforts, but such an argument is made moot by the extent to which the world has been reinvented. Sure, major races return, but their home regions are massive and lovingly populated with details. It pains us not to be able to divulge some of the cool things, but oh, what the hell. Zora's Domain and Lake Hyrule will astound. The water effects, river rapids mini-game and retooling of underwater swimming controls will have you grinning. It is wonderful stuff, it really is. There. Did that spoil things for you? We hope you'll indulge that little slip-up.   This is a massive game, not only in terms of grand scale, but also when considering the length of time it will take you to play through. See, there is a lot of gameplay, and very little is what we'd classify as waffle, either. None of it suffers from the Grand Theft Auto 'fetch-quest syndrome', which is fantastic. Even by the time you've invested 24 hours of your life into the game, you're likely only a small fraction of the way into the game. It realistically will take you five hours to reach the first dungeon - particularly if you take the time to explore and complete some sub-quests. This isn't a game for those with short attention-spans. The build-up is slow, but the reward is profound and long-lasting.   Link, in all his Hylian glory. His facial animation is very expressive in cutscenes.  The temples this time around are just as clever and tricky as in past efforts, and the number of temples sits at nine - equal to Ocarina. However, they are much, much larger and the puzzles are more complex. Each dungeon plays off of a central, large-scale puzzle, such as activating a central network of gears in order to restore water flow to each level, in the water temple. However, none are as maddeningly obtuse as Ocarina's water temple. This is both a blessing and a curse, since there aren't too many instances where we were left scratching our heads and hurling our wiimotes in jaded frustration. It's never easy, certainly, and never excruciatingly hard, either. Twilight strikes an excellent balance here, with a learning curve in the first couple temples aimed at introducing new players to the series, as well as catering to veterans who already understand the basic principles behind using a bow or claw-shot.   Koji Kondo, the father of Nintendo's most iconic theme songs, helms the mini-orchestral tracks in the game. From the understated choir and strings of the title-screen theme to the triumphant but foreboding overworld music, each song is a winner. Well composed and tuneful, these themes are never as rich as they rightfully should be, had they been performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra or equivalent. If ever there was a game that deserved a true symphonic score, this is it. You won't be disappointed, even for a second, with fresh takes on the village store theme, Epona's song, the Oath to Order from Majora's Mask and various Ocarina temple songs. But it's still midi, and that makes us a teensy bit sad at the thought of what might have been.    A lot has been made of Twilight's graphics - and most of it has been spurious lies and ridiculous over-exaggerations. Anyone who would fault the beauty of this game for not running in high resolution settings or not coating every surface in bump-mapping shouldn't even bother playing. This is not for them. Most of the niceties and subtleties of the gameplay would be as lost on them as the simple joys of watching the sunrise from high above Hyrule field. Or watching a storm-front gather and swirl overhead, before stooping the area in fog and shadows. Or the wonderful, skilful animation at work that breathes so much life into the world's characters. Then there's the artfully warped and saturated-but-dull style of the Twilight Realm, full of bloomed light and a fantastic airborne, oversized black-pixel effect that floats through the air like ash on the ethereal wind.   There is so much to look at and so much to be floored by. You'll forget all about the GameCube-birthed engine that occasionally has some muddy floor or wall textures. You'll ignore that the game has to load each new area you enter. In fact, you'll overlook the undeniable fact that this isn't a next-generation game - at least, in terms of visuals. A game needs not have the sharpest textures and highest polygon count in order to be beautiful. Twilight has more style and personality in one room than many next-gen efforts house in an entire level. Any screenshot will attest to this, and seeing the game running is the final nail in the coffin of undue graphical criticism.   Using the Wiimote to aim works flawlessly - if you have issues, be sure to adjust your sensor bar settings in the game, as well as in the Wii menu.  At the start of this review, we posed the many-layered question of whether Twilight tops Ocarina for the sheer experience and wonder. Do you remember the first time you pulled the Master Sword from the stone altar in the back of the Temple of Time? Or the first time you walked out of Link's treetop house and the midi-orchestral music kicked in and took your breath away? Twilight is full of moments like this, and you'll likely treasure each as much as you did with Ocarina of Time.    Whether Twilight Princess ever tops the first groundbreaking moments of Ocarina is open to debate. Like Super Mario 64, Ocarina of Time showed how a game could make the transition from 2D to 3D and leave a wake of pale imitators to dissect its gameplay for years to come. Really, Twilight Princess could never blow a hole in the industry of the same diameter. Instead, it builds on the concepts that Ocarina established. It refines the gameplay, broadens the scale of the world and retains what we loved about series as a whole.It also carries with its release a two-fold message - one, the Wii is more than capable of deep, engrossing and satisfying gameplay. Two, that The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess still does it better than any other similarly-themed game on the market. It exudes that Nintendo Magic that we've all felt each time we play a monumental game from that company. That we should get this, not in the final months of the GameCube's life, but instead at the dawn of the Wii, where it will be played and adored for years to come is a boon.There is so much that we still haven't touched on - which is usually a good sign for the depth and quality of a game. At the same time, half the pleasure to be gained from Twilight Princess is in discovering these things yourself. Why would we want to deny you of this? It is your reason to own a Wii and likely the last Zelda of this depth and style for quite some time. Go and get it; give yourself time to savour it. It will amaze.", "date": "Dec 5, 2006"}
