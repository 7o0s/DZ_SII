You've gotta admit, the very idea of evolution is intriguing, so many people would jump at the chance to play a video game version of it.  NEC's Seventh Cross marks the first real swing taken at this specific idea... Sadly, it's proven to be quite a whiff, and the proverbial gust of wind will be felt all across the globe.  The very first thing most people will notice upon booting up Seventh Cross is that they won't be able to save.  The game requires a whopping 172 blocks on your VMU. It wouldn't be excusable for a good game to basically require its own dedicated VMU, much less a lackluster game that most people won't feel compelled to play more than ten minutes.  Anyway, as mentioned above, Seventh Cross is a game based on the evolutionary process.  You play as a creature who must ascend the evolutionary ladder, continually evolving into a more sophisticated animal, with your ultimate goal being to become the dominate species on the planet. This isn't an easy task, as your beginnings in the protist stage of life are meager at best, and you'll find yourself running from small bugs and other creatures to save life and limb. After spending a time in a small tide pool, you'll have evolved to the point of ~Origin,~ which is really where the game begins, as you'll be able to meet enemies in combat rather than just dying when they inevitably catch you.  Creature advancements come largely from cashing in evolutionary points gained from defeating enemies at the various monoliths on the map. In the monoliths, players must paint a picture on a 10x10 grid with the six different colors given. The colors represent a range of different physical and mental attributes for the animal, with various placements and combinations affecting your next evolution differently. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any logic to this, as it's almost completely up to chance what advancement will occure upon finishing a picture. What's worse is that you'll often end up with advancements that you don't need yet, or even advancements that can't be used until the end of the game. Those without any luck will find themselves stuck in the tide pool for an extoardinarily long amount of time, as it's really up to fate whether or not you will receive an advancement that allows you to crawl out of the water. The hapless nature of evolving is continually a problem, as each time you will randomly receive one out of a whole spectrum of early and late evolutionary ~upgrades~ to your animal that may or may not be useful to you in the immediate future.  The basic core of the gameplay consists of running around and fighting enemies in hopes to become stronger. Unfortunately, there's nothing very interesting about the combat.  In typical melee encounters, you simply exchange blows until one collapses. There are also a number of long range attacks and spells that can be used a bit later in the game, but they too become monotonous, as there's no character interaction or story line to compell you to continue fighting a seemingly endless number of enemies. On top of that, if you die, you return to your state of origin, and will find yourself scrambling for enough nutrient points to get back to where you were. This is not only frustrating, but doesn't really make much sense.  In the real world, when an animal supposedly evolves, there isn't any turning back.  Poorly schemed gameplay aside, Seventh Cross is definitely among the worst looking Dreamcast games.  If it weren't such a subjective matter, I'd say that it's the worst looking. The textures are dull and lifeless, very much smelling afoul of Nintendo 64 efforts. Creatures themselves are sparsely modeled, particularly the enemies. Aside from their jerky and erradic animations, none of them are particularly ambitious in design. Your creature enjoys quite a large range of physical forms throughout its evolution, and while you undoubtedly look cooler than your enemies, you often appear freakish and unnatural. It seems as though the artists were going for something more ambitious and suitable, but ended with something that looks out of place because of the decidedly low polygon count. Perhaps what hurts the most is that, despite the very simplistic nature of the graphics, the framerate tends to get quite jittery when there are multiple organisms (teehee!) on the screen. My junior level detective skills tell me that sloppy programming is the culprit.  Sonically, Seventh Cross proves to be an eerie romp through the boonies. Not eerie in a good way, but in that the production values are eerily bad. Music is sparsely placed and mostly consists of a new agey sound, and the sound effects are mostly the same few samples used over and over. Needless to say, if you have the desire to play Seventh Cross beyond the initial ~eww~ factor, you'll find yourself reaching for the mute button.  In the end, Seventh Cross is a game that is based on a very ambitious design concept, but is ultimately held back by short sighted overall design and a problematic play system. At its core, it could have been quite ingenious with some aspect of control and micromanagement behind the evolution of your species.  But the random and haphazard nature of the gameplay turns a potentially rock solid foundation into a negative and unmemorable experience.  -- Matt White, Living proof that man came from apes", "date": "Jan 8, 2000"}
