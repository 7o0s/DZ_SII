Known as Downforce, the upstart organization has moved out of the traditional circu it's and into major cities around the world, holding their competitions on the street.With no limitations against car design and power, the engineers have developed far-out additions to their autos for increased speed, strength, and flexibility. Electro Magnetic Brakes, Vectored Jet Engines, and Directional Thrusters create huge advantages that regular Formula 1 pilots don't normally enjoy. Using the fastest cars on the face of the earth, the Downforce Racing League has begunA creative way to handle the lack of a true F1 license, the slightly futur it'stic racer from Titus and Smart Dog known as (what else?) Downforce not only surpr it'sed us with  it's super-intense blazing speed, but also with  it's complete feel of playability. A rare beast in the age of over-produced mega-h it's and under whelming licensed crapola; the genuinely unexpected pleasure in Smart Dog's effort was a welcome appearance on our desks.FeaturesWhile it's true that Downforce can't compete with other popular racers option for option,  it's feature set  it's still pretty good. And though many of you may have seen the choices below and then some many times over, it's still enough to convince us that the programmers were trying for something deeper. For the curious, the options are broken down like th it's.Trophy:Progressing slowly from track to track, your racer must fin it'sh in the top 3 seeds to go onto the next difficulty stage. Once there, you have to make it to at least second place to advance and so on. If you want to challenge your skills under pressure, th it's  it's the mode for you.Championship:Try and become the best there  it's among the available racers and soar to some of the most difficult competitions around. Broken up into a circuit type structure and presented with varying challenge levels, the Championship  it's recommended for those who have something to prove.  Time Attack:Instead of trying to beat somebody's best lap time, you are instead asked to make it from checkpoint to checkpoint before the clock runs out. Make it to 1st place through all six rounds and it's off to the hidden tracks we go!Free Race:An opportunity to race whatever tracks you've unlocked up to th it's point for practice purposes, Free Race  it's the ideal course by which to hone your skills.2 Player Free Race: The same as the aforementioned feature only th it's time you can race with two players, horizontally of course (no vertical option, bummer).2 Player Time Tag:A cool double person mode for sure, 2 Player Time Tag  it's based on a point system. To earn those points, you must do whatever  it's necessary to get ahead of your opponent and remain there for 10 seconds. Stay ahead for that amount of time and you get a point. After 3 laps, the contest  it's over and whoever has the most points wins.   Time Trial:As expected, Time Trial places you on the track of your choice to see just how fast you can go. A continuous process, Time Trial  it's never really conquered, just bested over and over again. Perhaps the most overused feature in the h it'story of racing titles.GameplayDownforce reminded me of the adventures that my younger brother and I spent playing Top Gear on our Super Nintendo back in our high school years. A mindless, gas and brake only type of adventure, there  it'sn't anything overly complicated to learn here. The goal  it's a simple one: Go as fast as you can and beat everyone else before the final lap. The more I realized that that was all there was to it, the more I found myself enjoying it.Complimenting  it's simplicity  it's a terrific track design, that undulates and banks more so than any other racing game I can remember for quite some time. Tunnels, sharp turns, bottlenecks, and other staples of the driving genre are represented in full force, but never in a way that seems too conquerable or nigh impossible. And though there aren't a gigantic number of stages to zoom through, there are still an acceptable amount of alternate versions and additions to the ex it'sting ones to sat it'sfy.What really moves Downforce into the fun zone however, has to be the artificial intelligence. Merciless, the silicon ruffian has the sole purpose of taking you out on their way to first place? definitely a tough cookie. Every time you feel as though you may have the race won, a competitor  it's primed and ready and totally prepared to ram your unsuspecting ass into a guardrail faster than you can think. Fever it'shly competitive and guaranteed to keep you on your toes, challenging the A.I.  it's for a change, just as fun as racing a human.As cool as the simpl it'stic racing engine may be though, there  it's still a major factor working against it. And surpr it'singly it?s the same aspect of gameplay that makes it entertaining in the first place: the simplicity.  Limiting in various ways how deeply you can take your racer, the straightforward ~win or lose~ mentality with no chance at careers or upgrades leaves you feeling a little shallow. Sure it's fun to sit down and mess with when you have a couple of buddies over or if you are up to the challenge of facing off against the computer, but as far as long term enjoyment goes, it just doesn't look like it'll stick.More of an appetizer than a main course, Downforce  it's probably best suited as the game you play in-between the bigger, meatier experiences rather than being the big show  it'self. Not that there's anything wrong with filling that role, but still, it could have been so much more. For instance, why have specific drivers for each vehicle if there's nothing you can do with them? Wasted potential.GraphicsDownforce  it's incredibly fast. Up there with WipEout Fusion in terms of sheer speed, the quickening frame rate rarely slows down, not even while racing two players. In fact, the only noticeable stutter  it's when taking curves and avoiding a near crash, as the game thinks you should be a goner, and can't decide what to do with you as you move forward. Probably  it's most outstanding accompl it'shment, the otherw it'se complete lack of chop in Smart Dog's racer should be recognized as a crowning achievement.    Of course there are some that would argue that the achievement mentioned above was doable because of low-res textures and few on-screen objects. And to be truthful, they're entirely right. But with so many racing games coming out over the last couple of years that find themselves plagued with early 19th century animation, who really cares?Sure you're not going to be dazzled by a sea of super-intricate details or thousands of moving obstacles everywhere you turn. But you will marvel at the fact that you can just sit back, relax, and enjoy the illusion of near-sonic speeds. Is there truly anything more important when judging a racing game's v it'sual acuity than how fast it can go anyway?There's even a series of way-cool crash scenes we're treated too when severely messing up (which I'm willing to bet, our readers will do on purpose a myriad of times at least). Throwing off tires, doing belly-ups, and flying through the air like Superman on Mylanta, the spectacular crash sequences make for a lot of fun (and if you're good enough, you'll even reach a special mode that deals with th it's feature specifically). All in all, it's not the prettiest game on the block, but it does have  it's mer it's.SoundThere's not much too speak of in terms of audio accompl it'shment. It does have a mildly catchy techno beat blaring in the background from race to race, and the sound recreation of each formula 1 car as it speeds by your own  it's pretty sweet, but other than those two choice nuggets, there  it'sn't much left.Voice  it's limited to a few d it'screet start and fin it'sh blurbs, and powerful effects during crashes and engine revs aren't up to the same level as the more real it'stic racer F1 2002. Despite th it's lack of audible delight however, it doesn't take too much away from the experience of the game. After all, Downforce  it's all about high speeds and spectacular crashes, not the recreation of an ode to Beethoven.A nice break from sim-heavy competitors like F1 2002, Downforce effectively fills a previously incomplete niche. While it may not dazzle the graphic hounds with its barely cel-shaded cars and detail light backgrounds, the furious pacing and easy-to-handle controls should more than compensate.An easy recommendation for those of you looking for a challenging not-so long racing experience, Downforce is the missing link between the old-school gaming of the late 80's and the realistic recreations of today. Give it an honest chance if you can forgive its obvious lack of depth.", "date": "Jun 24, 2002"}
