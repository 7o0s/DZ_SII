Though this may come as a surprise to those in marketing, a little bit of English slapped onto the title doesn't make WarTech any less niche. Part mech-shooter, part arcade-brawler and only part fun, Senko no Ronde is a game that flies in the face of conventional design and winds up feeling disjointed.    WarTech suffers from a bit of an identity crisis. At its heart the game is akin to Virtual On, one of SEGA's many cult classic game series.  If visions of twin arcade sticks are flashing through your head right now, then you know that means we're talking about an arcade combat game that pits oversized mechanical suits against one another. In this case, the suits are called Rounders. Controlled from above, players can fire off a small variety of attacks, put up shields to block said attacks, boost around, call in special upgrades, and even move in close for a good old hand-to-hand fracas.    This formula apparently wasn't enough for development house G.Rev because the game inexplicably turns into a classic shoot-em-up seemingly at random during the story mode. A lot about WarTech defies explanation.   The story makes no sense. Don't even try to decipher the sentences that are strung together to introduce stages or cap off the 20 minute experience (Yes, it only takes about 20 minutes to complete one of the eight storylines.). The English subtitles for the Japanese voicework are pure confusion.   The training mode offers no actual training. You can toy around with it and beat up on a dummy opponent, but you won't learn a darn thing about controls or strategy.    The score attack mode limits you to just a few lives and proposes a high score as the goal. Then it contradicts itself by giving players unlimited continues and awards an achievement for beating 10 stages rather than for obtaining a high score. Dying on the last stage will net the achievement.   Smooth jazz often plays as the soundtrack to a heated space battle.    If you enjoy wondering what the heck is going on, WarTech is right up your alley.   Setting aside reason, there is a bit to be interested in with WarTech. The eight characters, which tend toward the prepubescent girl motif a bit too much for our tastes, are surprisingly unique. Each has their own set of weapons that come with respective strengths and weaknesses. That includes the massive B.O.S.S. form each character can call in as a power-up every so often. These appropriately-named power-ups essentially turn your Rounder into a classic boss enemy that can fill the screen with little orbs or death, lasers, and other classic shoot-em-up projectiles.    With the various methods of attack at your disposal, the game becomes a series of close, mid-range, and long distance attacks. Each character is strong in one or two of these ranges, but not all three, so jockeying for position becomes just as important as how quickly you can string together combos. Knowing how to attack with your character of choice and when to call in the B.O.S.S. form is enough to give you an edge in online games.    Or it would be if you could find anyone to play with online. The niche status of WarTech doomed its online community from the start. You'll be lucky to ever find more than one or two people online and that number will only dwindle over time. The multiplayer can be played offline as well, though, so any long-term replayability you'll get out of this title will have to come via a local friend.   Aside from it being a game out of Japan for Xbox 360 with virtually no marketing hype, there are several other factors that will limit the appeal of WarTech, and thus the size of the online community. The controls, while completely customizable, aren't entirely satisfactory. This comes primarily from the fact that you aren't given complete control over where you shoot, making it impossible to lead a target in motion.  The action in WarTech never reaches fierce levels of intensity either. Incoming fire has a slow, plodding feel to it that is entirely the opposite of exciting.    Perhaps the biggest roadblock on the path to success for WarTech is its price tag. The actual content here, aside from a nice array of artwork, is limited, to say the least. Eight combatants, a handful of stages, and a few modes that all play fairly identically is all you get here. We've seen Live Arcade games that offer more than this, yet WarTech is a full retail release with the same price as any other game.WarTech: Senko no Ronde feels incoherent and out of place. The arcade shooter concept that it is built upon is sound but the follow-through just isn't there. There is little to be interested in here outside of the multiplayer mode, Even then, the unsatisfying controls limit what strives to be a unique experience. This attempt at modernizing an old school design perhaps would have been more at home with 2D graphics and an Xbox Live Arcade release.", "date": "May 30, 2007"}
