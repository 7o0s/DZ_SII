He's a mascot who flourished in his early days, with his earliest appearances coming in some of Nintendo's most classic and respected titles. There's no denying the lasting appeal of Super Mario World, and its sequel, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, is still recognized as a Miyamoto masterpiece. But after those games came and succeeded, there began an attempt to separate Yoshi from the Mario universe. To make him more of a standalone mascot, with his own series of titles.   It's an attempt that's largely failed. Games headlined by Yoshi alone have often been limited, criticized, too short or just not much fun  titles like Yoshi and Yoshi Topsy-Turvy have been disappointing, and won't be too fondly remembered in the years to come. It's been a downswing in popularity and potential that's sad to see, so it's sad to see, again, the game where it all began  Yoshi's Story.   Baby Bowser is once again up to no good, and has this time managed to trap the entirety of Yoshi's Island within the pages of a pop-up storybook, while simultaneously kidnapping the life-giving Super Happy Tree. Six baby Yoshis, freshly hatched into this world gone wrong, set out to set things right  by eating as much as possible.     The gameplay goal of Yoshi's Story is to feed on fruit. Thirty pieces, per level, and the level ends after eating the thirtieth. There's no end-of-stage finish line, or flagpole to jump onto. Just fruit, scattered everywhere. Each level just cycles back to its own beginning if you travel too far from the start.   It's nonsensical. And worse, unengaging. Gamers of the day 10 years ago when Yoshi's Story first arrived were left scratching their heads, as this system of grocery-hunting was far and away removed from the style of play presented in the SNES Yoshi's Island, and far and away removed from that game's sense of fun. Though the cries of a dislodged Baby Mario were annoying there, they reinforced the sense of urgency and purpose in that game  caretaking the young hero all the way through the 50+ levels separating him and his kidnapped brother. Here, with Yoshi jumping, floating, and lashing his long tongue by his lonesome, the premise feels disconnected. Boring.   And it's a feeling only made worse by Yoshi's Story's length, which totals less than half of the 50+ stages presented by its predecessor. There are only 24 levels in this game, and even more restrictive is the fact that you will only play through six of them in any single playthrough. Story adopts a Star Fox style of branching level progression, meaning you only see a handful of the total number of areas between the beginning and end of any individual play session.   The arguments adopted by pro-Yoshi's Story advocates in the past decade have pointed to the game's unique and inventive visuals, which are still in place and do look good. Or they've referenced that Yoshi's Story is really more meant for younger players, which is also true, and it is a game that would still serve that crowd. But for the hardcore, dedicated gaming fan, Yoshi's Story was and still is a letdown overall. It's not the sequel to Yoshi's Island that it could have been, and time and a transition to the Virtual Console has done nothing to change that either.So don't spend 1000 of your Wii Points on a download of this adventure, unless you've already established yourself as a fan of its style through playing the original cartridge version years ago, or unless you think its lack of challenge would be a good match for the skill level of a younger gamer in your home. Most players would be better served to hold on to their digital dollars in anticipation of the eventual VC arrival of Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, which is by far the best Yoshi title ever created. Or, if you have some real, paper money in your pocket, the recent DS releases Yoshi's Island DS and Yoshi Touch & Go are respectable as well  they could be a sign that Yoshi's due for an upswing sometime soon. Just not right now, and not with this release. Steer clear.", "date": "Sep 19, 2007"}
