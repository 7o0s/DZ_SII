Just how stupid do you think we are? Didn't we already say Brain Boost sucked over a year ago? So why is it that we're seeing it again? Oh wait, this time it's Mega Brain Boost, combining both of the original lame Brain Boost games, and adding five more uninspired games to make some sort of super lame ripoff Nintendo DS title. Because hey, why bother to improve on the product when you can just repackage it and try to pass it off as something new?   For those that missed Brain Boost the first time, it was a series of two titles that each had five bland minigames. There's a doctor that looks like a fish-clown-cucumber hybrid, plus a monkey boy and a robot pig. The major problem with the game was that five minigames is abysmally few, and the games weren't fun at all anyway. The game missed the point of what made Brain Age and Big Brain Academy so popular, and was the first, of many, brain game ripoffs.   We'll give props to the developer for one thing with Mega Brain Boost. Supplying 15 minigames in the package instead of only five is a considerable step in the right direction. However, these are the same minigames that were uninspired and not fun back when the brain game genre was still a novelty.   The five new games aren't any better either. A couple of them are essentially the same thing as the original games. For instance, one of the new games is ~Dots~ which has players count dots on the screen. It's a lot like the game ~Moving Dots~ excepts the dots don't move. So it's even more boring. The other minigames didn't manage to make the translation jump. The Kanji recognition challenge is frustrating and overly difficult due to the fact that we... don't know Kanji. It doesn't teach us Kanji, it just wants us to find it. We don't even know what the word is, or if the other Kanji symbols in the group are even real.   Still not fun. Mega Brain Boost performs the same way its predecessors did: poorly. There still isn't any sort of progression. No chart to track how well we're doing, no calendar to mark how often we play. Each game has the player's high score, which is replaced if they beat it, but there's no motivation to try. There isn't even an overall test to give us the obligatory measurement of our brain power.   When the developers crammed the titles together, they seemed to have removed any sort of presentation. There used to be an unnecessary, but kind of cute, story about the monkey and pig robot. It's not missed until the characters appear on screen, and then it's just bizarre to see random character we don't know.Mega Brain Boost is just three times the junk that Brain Boost was over a year ago. It wasn't fun then, and it really isnt fun now, especially considering that other third-party developers have managed to make good brain games. It's insulting that the developer and publisher would just throw this game back out without bothering to improve the core mechanics of the title. Dumb move.", "date": "Feb 28, 2008"}
