Not only was it hidden as a collectible in Animal Crossing for the GameCube (which, in turn, is downloadable into a linked-up Game Boy Advance system), but it was also among the third edition batch of NES e-Reader cards. The game has already established itself as a fun and challenging classic that retains its charm in handheld form, but the latest release of the game on cartridge in the Classic NES Series brings back a couple of elements previously lost in the portable translation.  This 1984 release puts players in the role of a parka-donning character who's task is to simply climb up to the top of a mountain peak, shattering ice blocks with his hammer in order to gain access to the different layers of the mountain. Players can also use the hammer to whack the different enemies trying to push the ice climber off the mountain. Bonus rounds are at the top of the mountain, but if you screw up during this round, you get no points at all.   This ~platformer~ is anything but traditional due to its loose controls, and much of the game's challenge revolves around the slightly clumsy movement of the characters (it is on ice, after all). A leap doesn't give the Ice Climber much distance to the left and right, which makes it just slightly infuriating to miss a ledge by a mere pixel and plummet to death in a strategically placed pitfall. Overall the game is a great pick-up-and-play game on the Game Boy Advance, that's enhanced with the game's ability to keep in cartridge memory the highest score obtained. Something the original NES game didn't do.  The most significant aspect of the Famicom Mini edition Ice Climber is that, because it includes the most current NES/Famicom emulation, it's the first time the game's hit the GBA with multiplayer support. The NES-to-GBA system emulator included in the e-Reader and in Animal Crossing couldn't support two players in any game since it didn't feature link cable functionality. The Classic NES Series series goes a step further: features support for both link cable and Wireless Adapter, and finally lets two players go at it in the same game. The addition of a second player changes up the gameplay from a careful platformer to more of a ~race to the top~ design since any player left behind during the vertical scroll is instant death.  The new NES emulation in Ice Climber also eliminates the display ~shimmying~ of the e-Reader and Animal Crossing versions. The developers still must give the game a ~squished~ appearance since the display aspect ratio of the GBA isn't as tall as the original system. But only purists will notice the compressed image; it's done so well that newcomers to the franchise should be oblivious to the effect.Ice Climber is a great game that holds its own 20 years later, and although it was given away in Animal Crossing and printed on inexpensive playing cards in e-Reader format, the addition of two player support and cartridge high score save is enough to recommend adding the Classic NES Series edition to anyone's classic collection.", "date": "Jun 4, 2004"}
