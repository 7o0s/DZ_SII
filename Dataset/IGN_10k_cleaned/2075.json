At a time when we thought know one cared about the Dreamcast, here comes Sammy Entertainment, who also will be publishing Guilty Gear X on the PS2, releasing a light gun game for the Dreamcast.  Now, before you starting writing angry, flaming emails to Sammy Entertainment on why they chose to bring Death Crimson OX over Guilty Gear X, let me explain why it kind of makes sense.  You see, the Dreamcast has been blessed with several superb 2D fighting games, but since the announcement that SEGA would be going the third party route, fewer third party titles have been selling.  Even Capcom, who has been one of the longest supporters of the Dreamcast, has shied away from bringing anymore titles beyond Heavy Metal Geomatrix; Capcom Vs SNK 2 is still up in the air for the DC.  So why not bring a game that's in a genre we haven't seen much of - the light gun-shooting genre - rather than diving into a genre that has several titles?  From that standpoint, you'll probably sell more of the light-gun game because there aren't as many.  That may or may not have been the logic behind Sammy's decision to bring Death Crimson OX, but there's no logical reason why you should buy this game as it barely offers a challenge, contains dated visuals, the game makes no sense, and overall, is no fun to play.  I'm not one to really pay attention to the storyline of a light gun shooter, but for the case of Death Crimson OX, that's almost impossible.  For the Cliff Notes version, you play either Yuri or Kou Yanami, and with the ancient super gun known as the Crimson, save Lily who has been kidnapped by the evil forces.  It's actually, much more complex than that, as Kou was once part of the evil forces, known as SMO, but decided to switch to the good guys, the Resistance, because he got tired of being an agent Subliminer... don't worry if this doesn't make sense.  I believe this confusing story is trying to draw your attention away from how bad this game is. Death Crimson OX's gameplay is like any other light gun game; aim at enemies and shoot enemies till their dead.  You really can't wreck this formula unless (1) enemy placement is awkward (2) the pace of the action is either two fast or two slow, and (3) you never feel like you're in any danger.  Yep, Death Crimson OX hits all three checkmarks.  There are some enemies that are place in really narrow areas, sometimes right behind another enemy.  You don't really encounter this bad placement of baddies until the later levels, where five enemies appear with two hiding behind two of them.  Secondly, the pace of the action doesn't do a good job of building excitement to the climatic battle of every end level boss.  On a side note, enemies and bosses are a bunch of really weird robots, undead zombies, skeletons, and even butterflies.  That's right... butterflies.  To it's credit, DCOX does try a few different things for a light gun game, one being the weapon power-ups.  When you get the machine gun power-up, hold down the trigger to charge the shot - the longer you hold the trigger, the more powerful the shot delivered.  Machine gun power-ups can also be stored so you have several shots available, and they do carry over to the next level.  Unfortunately, you don't get to use this power-up often enough.  Because you're holding the trigger button to charge a shot, you can't attack at all.  The second enhancement is the experience you gain as you shoot enemies.  By increasing your experience level, you're life meter will get larger so you'll be able to take more hits.  That's a nice feature that ultimate leads to the game's third problem, where you never feel like you're in any danger.  This makes the game pretty easy in the normal story and even in mission mode.  Bullet mode is pretty challenging as you try to clear stages by using the fewest bullets possible - miss a shot and your ammo decreases.  But even then, the basic gameplay won't keep anyone but children under five interested... and even then, that's debatable.  Now, we come to the visuals and if this game released in the US when the Dreamcast first came out, it would've been acceptable.  As it is, this game is far from being even half as good-looking as SEGA' recent Confidential Mission.  Colors are very drab and enemies don't animate very well.  Speaking of animation, when there are cut sequences of your characters, they move in a the most robotic fashion.  Although there's a strange mix of enemies ranging from mechs, Arabian swordfighters, and animated skeletons, they're all pretty simple textures decorating this ghastly group.  Anyone who has played House Of The Dead 2 or Confidential Mission, will probably be tempted into playing Death Crimson OX, but please don't make that mistake.  The game doesn't offer anything that the other two gun games at all.  I find it hard that even the most fanatical light gun gamer will want to play Death Crimson OX as it lacks both visual appeal and overall fun.", "date": "Aug 22, 2001"}
