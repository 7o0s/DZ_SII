This is a bit of an unfamiliar experience these days, at least from my narrow perspective.  I can't say whether games in general have gotten easier in recent years, since that gets into all sorts of difficult questions about exactly what fraction of ~games in general~ I've played and how hard all that stuff from back in the day actually was when you take ten years of reflex development into account, but I can say that I've played an awful lot of easy games recently, and that Thunderstrike: Operation Phoenix is a good deal more challenging than any of those.  It's challenging in good ways, though, and challenging in some bad ones.  It features some of my least favorite shooter design elements, and it suffers from some kind of hideous memory caching woes that in turn spawn a few very frustrating interface issues, but on the other hand, if you can get your thumbs around the control scheme and your mind around its niceties of strategy, Thunderstrike does have some classic chopper action to offer you.  Not that anyone remembers what said action is like, but nostalgia springs eternal.  Gameplay  If you want a game to compare this to on a console, I think you'd honestly have to go back to the last Thunderstrike, two of which Core made for the Sega CD back in the day.  Before that, things get real hazy, since helicopter sims have generally been a PC-based genre, and you have to go all the way back to stuff on the NES whose titles I can hardly remember (did Gunship ever wind up on a console?  Man, that was a long time ago...).  Comparisons aside, this isn't that complicated a game.  You control your attack chopper from first- or third-person view (including a keen little cockpit view with a visible HUD and other decorations), blazing through a variety of escort, strike, and S&D missions using straightforward, arcade-style controls.  Arcade-style, at least, in comparison to the Jane's school of PC chopper sim -- the Dual Shock control scheme may actually be a little less than intuitive for console gamers.  It's perfectly sensible once you get the hang of it (a little like dual-analog FPS control), but it may take a while for some players to get the hang of handling altitude and heading controls in concert, since it takes two thumbs to manage both.  Once you know how to fly, all you have to do is shoot, and this isn't that difficult either in principle.  You have four weapon hardpoints to kit out, including your cannon (of which there are three types, trading rate of fire for penetration power and vice versa), which can be filled with all sorts of bombs, missiles, and specialized destructive devices.  The arsenal is much broader than expected, including everything from TV-guided missiles to antiship torpedos to antirunway cluster bombs.  The variety of armaments does a fine job of adding to the variety of missions, allowing you to adapt your loadout to the task and terrain at hand.  That's only part of the planning end of things, though -- Thunderstrike demands a substantial degree of strategy to combat in general and each mission in particular.  For example, early on, you may wonder ~How the hell do I survive this?  The SAMs kill me in no time flat, and I don't have enough missiles to get them from over the horizon!~  Think a little deeper, though, and you may realize that SAMs are useless without radar to guide them -- kill the one radar dish and you can disable an entire AA emplacement.  That's characteristic of some of the smarter qualities to the level design.  This is an arcade game in certain aspects, but you are NOT allowed to damn the torpedos without selecting your targets and planning your attack, which does a lot for the replay value of the individual missions and the campaigns as a whole.  One big problem, though: lose a mission, and you're booted WAY back to the original start screen, after a look at the high score tally.  There's no ~retry mission~ option after you die -- to give it another go, you have to slog through all the briefing and weapon loadout screens, which means two or three medium load times and the tedium of setting up your secondary weapons how you like them.  This is just silly.  What earthly reason is there that the player should not be able to charge right back in, particularly considering how frequently death comes when you're just starting out at the game?  Presumably said reason has something to do with memory management, but when you combine it with the moderate load times, this approaches the inexcusable.  Graphics  Particularly odd, too, is the fact that the game doesn't seem to be loading anything all that complicated.  Thunderstrike moves at a perfect 60fps clip, but the levels generally have a limited color scheme (desert, forest, tundra, and the like), there's moderate aliasing in evidence, and the polygon architecture is simple enough, with broad, simple terrain formations and nothing too complicated in the way of man-made constructions (read: targets).  This is a good-looking game, but not a flashy one, even when the action speeds up and the contrails start streaking across the sky.  The modeling and animation of your AH-74 gunship is perhaps the visual high point.  It would be a shame to use the plain old first-person view, and pass up checking out the dolled-up cockpit (complete with dangling lucky charms) or the cool third-person view.  The game is remarkably playable from any viewpoint, but the scenery is the best when you can see some of your chopper and its many cute little animating bits.  Sound  The game falls down a little in the audio department, with a brooding ambient soundtrack instead of the heavy, distortion-driven sounds you'd expect from this kind of game.  Often it's easy to forget there's any music playing at all.  Of course, cranking the tunes too high would run the risk of drowning out the sound of SAM warnings, which you definitely want to be able to hear (while you can see missiles on radar, they usually don't appear soon enough), but there ought to be some sort of balance in this category between eggheaded strategy and meatheaded violence.  The sound does a good job of complementing the sim end of things, though, as expected.  Listening to the battle is an important aspect of keeping track of the bad guys -- pay close attention and you can follow the direction of antiarcraft fire and SAM batteries.  The less attentive can always just wait for your ground control to yell out a missile warning, but if you want a job done right, best to do it yourself.Thunderstrike is a workmanlike effort by most standards, but I'm always ready to award bonus points to the revival of a long-forgotten genre.  There's not a lot available in this category on a console, and Thunderstrike does a fine job of filling the chopper-sim niche.  What's more, as I say, it offers an honest challenge.  There are two difficulties: Normal and Hard.  Those bums breezing through Devil May Cry right now may as well not bother suiting up.The interface issues are NOT fun to deal with, though, which is why I'd recommend a rental in order to test your patience with the load times before dropping the full purchase price and owning Thunderstrike for good.  It's a pity that a problem like that should get in the way of an otherwise fun game, but I just write the reviews, unfortunately.  Of course, put me in charge of anything else and lord only knows what happens...", "date": "Oct 22, 2001"}
