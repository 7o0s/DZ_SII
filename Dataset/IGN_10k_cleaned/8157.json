Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/02/sam-max-episode-4-abe-lincoln-must-die-review", "text": "Sam and Max are now in the second half of their first episodic adventure and we're happy to say that series has finally started to offer a taste of the madcap humor and interesting puzzles that we've been hoping for. We're hoping that the developers are encouraged to push the boundaries even further with regard to comedy and challenge, but this is definitely an improvement over the previous episodes in the series.  This time around Sam and Max are called in to investigate some strange behavior at the White House. It seems that the President has been acting a little differently lately and it's up to the deranged duo to find out why. Once the real meaning of the President's unusual actions are revealed, Sam and Max will have to run for President themselves against the most unlikely of opponents, a giant animated statue of Abraham Lincoln.   The overall premise and the actual script are a lot better and have finally started to approach that rarified zone of zaniness that characterized the duo's first game. Much of the credit has to go to Curse of Monkey Island writer Chuck Jordan who has stepped in here to provide a script that's actually worth laughing at. From throwaway gags about the Jersey Devil or a civil war in the Dakotas to the characterizations of presidents and presidential candidates, the whole adventure is full of gags that just work.  The concepts of politics and the campaign process are definitely ripe for satire and the script takes jabs in a number of directions. The President here is out of touch with reality and his secret service is easily manipulated by their literal-mindedness and loyalty to bureaucracy. The candidate seeking to replace the President is only capable of reading sound bytes off of cue cards. In all it's a long way from last episode's lame attempts to send up American Idol and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. Just in case you're worried that this sounds a little lofty, the humor in Abe Lincoln Must Die! doesn't really try to hard to have a point. Rather it simply uses some basic truths as a springboard for some screwball gags.  Unfortunately, the running gags involving Bosco and Sybil are both wearing a bit thin and your interactions with them here aren't particularly entertaining. By this point the new disguises and occupations that both of them adopt are getting a little predictable. Sybil actually changes jobs again during the course of this episode. On the plus side, it seems that Sybil has run out of space on the sign outside her door, so that at least should challenge to writers to come up with something new for Episode 5. (We will say that the painted corrections on her window after her job change are freaking hilarious.)   It's also a bit of a shame that we're not seeing more locations and characters introduced in each episode. It's true that the White House is a great location, full of great gags, and it's true that the Presidents involved are genuinely hilarious (~I freed the slaves! I'm on the penny!~), one new location and two memorable characters don't really add up to much, particularly when you consider that none of them are likely to be used in future installments.  In a way, the episodic format doesn't really allow for much of an overall story arc. We, for instance, still aren't really sure that the story is building to something. There are little five second clips at the end of each episode that hint at something going on behind the scenes but there's really no connection from one episode to the next. Sure, the Soda Poppers are back but their interaction with the actual story is pretty minimal. Let's not even talk about Hugh Bliss, the bit character from last episode who has an even bittier part here. We'll allow that the episodes should stand on their own but Telltale should do a better job of rewarding fans with content that carries through from one episode to the next.      A few of the puzzles are satisfyingly difficult this time around. Even better, there are a couple of extended multi-part puzzles that require a small bit of A to B to C style thinking. Getting the debates to come off correctly took us a few tries, for instance. Figuring out the final puzzle wasn't particularly difficult but it did require us to connect more than just a few dots.  Still, the short nature of the episode and the limited number of items you can pick up mean that none of the puzzles are going to require any great leaps of ingenuity. If you can pick something up, you're going to need it very soon and in a very direct and obvious manner. Worse, this episode has even more of the pointless running back and forth between locations than any episode in the series. We don't mind having to backtrack a bit but there are a couple of instances here that have you running back and forth a few times just to solve a single puzzle.   The graphics are as good as ever, better even in some cases. The White House exterior is brilliant and we love the orange sky. It's just one of those little touches that reinforces the overall wackiness of the experience. Both the President and Abe Lincoln look phenomenal and are full of personality. We particularly like the little presidential poses that Max strikes. Watch for them and you'll know what we mean. (Fans needn't worry; he still scratches his ass and makes armpit noises too.)  Musically, this offering is a welcome departure for the series. While we really like the jazzy soundtrack of the previous installments, the presidential score that punctuates the action here is even better. The orchestration and style of the music here perfectly fits the subject matter and we'd love to hear even more variety in the future.  Best of all, Abe Lincoln Must Die! features an elaborate musical number that's one of the funniest pieces in the series to date. Though the lyrics to ~War! What Is It Good For?~ aren't quite as obviously hilarious as the Mafia Bear song from last episode, the whole Busby Berkeley meets Riverdance style presentation was more than enough to have us laughing out loud.   The voice work continues to improve as well, and should finally put to rest any doubts that longtime fans have had about their suitability for their roles.From a standpoint of humor and intelligent writing, Abe Lincoln Must Die! is our favorite Sam and Max episode to date. Yes, the recycled gags and locations and characters are getting more and more tiresome each time we see them, but the new content here is much closer to the Sam and Max we've been hoping to see than anything the series has delivered so far. We're still hopeful that we'll see more challenging puzzles in the future and more of a sense that the story's actually building to something worthwhile but, if the humor stays this good, we'll keep playing regardless.", "date": "Mar 2, 2007"}
