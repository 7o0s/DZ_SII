Though limited by the handheld's lackluster screen, some of the gameplay elements remain intact in the monochrome Game.com Resident Evil 2. Sadly, an awkward pseudo-3D approach and troubled controls keep the game from playing even remotely as well as its famous 32- and 64-bit cousins.  Features  Single-player game. Contains Leon's quest from the PSX game. Follows Capcom's RE2 scenario and storyline. Tons of different background graphics, based on the PSX ones. New item locations. Tracks gameplay time.   The Game Imagine Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation mixed with the control and presentation of a Game & Watch game. Of course, Tiger's handheld is capable of cranking out much more detailed backgrounds, but like many Game.com titles, Resident Evil 2 uses a section-based animation system. When moving your character, he doesn't smoothly move across the screen  instead, the image of Leon somewhat jumps from place to place. When he moves away from the camera, he is scaled appropriately to make it seem like he really is moving in three dimensions. Unlike in the console versions of RE2, where the character is polygonal and can change direction ~on the pixel~, Game.com makes you wait until the animation has run its course. This causes a delay for almost every action and makes the controls feel much more sluggish than in the console versions.  Having gotten this out of the way, RE2 does to a certain extent recreate the same style and feel of the PlayStation hit, down to the door animations that were used to hide load time in the PSX original. Although they have been changed around quite a bit, almost all of the background screens have been adapted for Game.com  the basketball court is there, the gun shop, the ambulance, and so on. But where the original used scripted scenarios (such as zombies crashing through a window, killing the gunshop owner) and cut-scenes to draw gamers into the story  and giving them a good scare, of course  the Game.com version has to rely exclusively on zombie-killing action. But because of the unprecise controls, shooting zombies is often more an exercise in frustration than it is fun. To make matters worse, getting munched on by a zombie can easily spell Leon's doom, even if he had full health prior to his encounter. The C Button is set up to let gamers push zombies away when they get too close (similar to the console RE2), but this rarely works. Saving is handled in exactly the same way as in the PSX version. Find a ribbon and a typewriter, then save your game. The only difference here is that you can save directly to the Game.com's internal back-up.  If there is one department where Resident Evil 2 stands out, it's sound. There isn't much in the ways of music, but fans will recognize plenty of the original sound samples, including the ominous ~Resident Evil... Two...~ announcer at the beginning.  Expect frustration galore in this partially faithful port that looks like Resident Evil 2, sounds like Resident Evil 2, but lacks the captivating qualities of the Capcom adventure series. Give it a look if you're a huge fan of the horror game genre, but remember that the scariest thing in this game are the controls.", "date": "Jul 15, 1999"}
