Like a miniaturized version of Madden or MLB, each year Atari makes use of official licenses, shrinks the packages down to kid-friendly form, and offers a simplistic cross-section of the sport.  If you aren't familiar with he series, the Backyard franchises often make use of generic (but useable) control mechanics that are already tried and true, and then sprinkle in a small amount of over-the-top gameplay around some power-ups, create-a-player, and the mix of official MLB players and fantasy characters as well, all in kid form.   Usually we'd take one look a game like Backyard Baseball '09 for DS, play it for a few minutes, and the expected result would take place: We'd grow bored almost instantly, and add it to the ~pass~ pile.  This isn't the case this year.  With Backyard making its way to DS after finding a home on GBA, GameCube, and PS2, the design actually works pretty well with the touch integration, lower graphical expectations all around (compared to PS2 and GCN, DS is obviously simpler), and some intuitive controls.  It isn't a must-play game by any means, but it certainly has the core sport of baseball down, and it's the first Backyard offering out there that's sure to satisfy; at least for the younger crowd.  Looks decent and pretty fun to play.  Backyard Baseball '09 follows the same template as previous Backyard games, so DS owners can expect a mini roster of MLB greats.  This time around Backyard Baseball has included at least one member of every MLB team, so you'll have greats such as Ken Griffey Jr., ~A-Rod~ Alex Rodriquez, Ryan Howard, Johan Stantana, Alfonso Soriano, and cover boy David ~Big Papi~ Ortiz.  Since the characters are shrunk down on to the DS, as well as catering to the Backyard style, you won't find much realism between the in-game counterparts and the actual pros, but then again, last year's top MLB Nintendo product Power Pros on Wii didn't exactly need to accomplish that either.  You get the names, the stats, and the virtual likeness.  From there, it's all about pairing your team together, straightening your rally cap, and hitting the field.   Since this is the first year for Backyard Baseball on DS, control was obviously a worry.  Using a blend of both traditional and touch controls, however, Atari has hit it off pretty well, as the entire game can be played with or without buttons or touch.  We started off by using nothing but d-pad and buttons, but by the end actually preferred touch control, as it makes base running, pitching, and throwing pretty dang simple.  Backyard Baseball isn't out to win any awards for its amazing experience on DS, but if the goal was to make a simple package that younger players could get into easily, this one's a success.  You've still got simple graphics, an amazingly basic presentation, and very few options, but it's still pretty fun to play.     As always, we'll continue to beg Atari to change up their sound production for the Backyard franchise, as it was, is, and may continue to forever be painful at best.  Players step to the plate accompanied by about three seconds of tunes, and then the game goes entirely silent.  Sound effects are very, very minimal, there's no crowd or ambient noise, and the announcer is extremely irritating to listen to.  We got by just fine with the classic snippets of dialogue way back on NES and SNES, and if a generic ~out~ and ~safe~ shout every now and then works, by all means go back to it, and use the saved space for better in-game sounds.  The voice actor Atari continues to use time and time again is really hurting the presentation and it's high time to start from scratch as far as sound design goes.  The Backyard series was far from perfect on GBA, and has stunk pretty bad on DS thus far, with the exception of Backyard Basketball.  Usually these games are quick little cash cows that are rushed out the door, but every once in a while we find one that stands above the rest.  Backyard Baseball 09 works, and while it still has the same general shortcomings that arrive with every Backyard title year after year (weak visual design, horrible audio, and extremely simple interface and presentation), the gameplay is there this time around, and its due in a large part to the intuitive touch controls.  Its not perfect by any means, but for this years baseball head-to-head Backyard isnt looking too bad.  The control works, there are some decent moments of fun to be had, and theres even multi-card two player should you find someone else with the game.  A little effort goes a long way.", "date": "Apr 4, 2008"}
