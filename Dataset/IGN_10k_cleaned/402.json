Ready 2 Rumble Boxing for the N64 does not look as good as the Dreamcast version of the game. Now that we're done with that we can tell you that all of the nutty characters are still full of personality, the boxers move very quickly and the arcade fun just doesn't stop. It just looks like an N64 game instead of a DC game. You have all of the features and options and depth of the Dreamcast and PSX versions of Ready 2 Rumble, including the constant and haunting presence of Michael Buffer's voice and picture, but it looks a little fuzzier. In fact, we'll just come out and say it: playing this game on the N64 is just like playing it on the DC.....if you were looking at your television through a dirty screen door.   Gameplay You've basically got three ways to play R2R to get the most fun out of it. The Arcade Mode just lets you jump right in and pummel somebody with any of the 13 characters that are available at the start of the game. The Arcade Mode is also how you'll get to the two player mode so you and a gaming buddy can quickly establish bragging rights. The Championship Mode serves as the career mode where you can take a boxer to the top of the R2R boxing universe.  All of the modes are fun, but there's nothing like some head to head videogaming boxing to get your competitive juices flowing.  The Arcade Mode is straightforward and simple. Pick your fighter, learn the controls and proceed to whoop ass. Whooping ass in R2R is directly related to your mastery of the button and control system. Your C-buttons control your left/right hand and high/low punches in a very logical set up and the A and B buttons are used for defense to block and evade incoming fists. It's interesting that this boxing game might end being one of the best fighters on the N64, because you've got a variety of special moves and special attacks that use some complicated button and control pad/analog stick sequences. Just like your classic Capcom fighting games the fun doesn't start until you can use the special attacks with confidence. That's how you become dangerous.  In Ready 2 Rumble you build up special attack power by landing power punches on your opponent. How much power you've earned is designated by the letters that pop up on the bottom of your side of the screen. If you collect R,U,M,B,L and E, your boxer will power up and their boxing gloves will be shining with energy as Buffer hollers out, ~Rumbllllllllle!~ Now, you'll be able to unleash Rumble specific moves. All fighters will be able to use a Rumble Flurry and will have increased speed during the five or so seconds of ~Rumble Mode.~ The Rumble Flurry and other combinations available can knockdown all but the healthiest of opponents if the entire sequence of punches land cleanly. This is a very satisfying part of the game.  Most fights against both human and computer controlled opponents will revolve around trying to get to Rumble Mode. Even if you can't hit them with every punch of a combo, the extra speed boost is enough to scare the wits out of the other guy.   Ready 2 Rumble is a button masher/strategic hybrid fighting game. Just like Mike Tyson in his prime, you'll be all technique in the beginning as you try to pick your opponent apart, but once you hurt him or her, all poise goes out the window as you try to unload the most powerful punches in your arsenal to knock somebody's head off. This makes for some pretty intense gaming, especially when you're playing against a friend, and on the N64 controller, with the tiny c-buttons as your main targets, you'll get some of the best ~Nintendo-thumb~ blisters the Nintendo 64 has to offer. This is not a bad thing.    The Championship Mode is where you can take a fighter through the ranks of R2R's boxers, unlocking new fighters along the way. You start of with a choice of three fighters and a stake of cash. You pick your guy, name  your gym and start your mission. You have 20 fights in which to advance to the higher class of fighters, designate by bronze, silver and gold. The challenge comes from the fact that you have to pay entry fees to fight other contenders, but you have to earn money through prize fights. Both title fights and prize fights count against your 20 fight total and there are 10 boxers you have to get through. Add to this that you also have to spend money training your fighter and all of a sudden you've got a heap of real world boxing problems that you have to deal with in this game. Like every other sport, the only thing that cures all is winning.   As you progress through Championship Mode you'll unlock new fighters that you can train to go along with the three you started with. Finishing the game means unlocking all of the hidden boss fighters that are usually the champions, or top contenders. You don't unlock the champs by simply beating them. That would be too easy. To finish the game, you'll have to take all of the regular fighters that you've unlocked and take them to the top. This adds up to hundreds of fights, even if you're good at the game. This is one area where R2R falls a little short because the tedium of knocking out the same fighters over and over again is enough to wear on anyone's nerves. Even though the boss fighters are simply badasses, that's a lot of game time for only a handful of rewards.  Graphics This is the biggest drawback to the game, only because we know what it's supposed to look like. If you could journey to a parallel dimension where the Dreamcast doesn't exist and our IGNDC editors really were monkeys then R2R on the N64 would be the most exciting fighting game on the console. In fact it might still be so in this dimension. However, knowing that the wonderfully designed original characters for this game were intended for Sega's latest console, we can't help but point out the differences.  Where you get moving eyes and mouths in the DC version of R2R, you get dark, shadowed out areas on the N64 so as to obscure the fact that those eyes and mouths aren't animated. Really, all we're talking about here is detail. The moving body parts and boxing animations are present in the N64 game and very well done, but not as complete as those in the Dreamcast game. Butcher Brown looks very much like the Bigfoot character from that shlocky Harry and the Hendersons movie in the Dreamcast version of the game, right down to those creepy facial animations. On the N64, Brown simply looks like a scowling Mike Tyson.   While the N64 can't do graphics on the same scale as Dreamcast, Midway left many of them in the game anyway but at a lower level of detail. This is what gives the N64 version its decidedly rougher look. Clothes don't flow, hair doesn't bounce and fighters don't wink the same on the N64 game. But one similarity is that the game still moves fast. The crazy assortment of punches still move and slice and snap like they're supposed to.  The framerate is pretty consistent and doesn't chop up enough to keep you from enjoying the action. That the developer of the N64 version, Point of View, managed to keep everything fast and frantic is certainly an accomplishment. It's a shame that anything had to be sacrificed in the N64 version of the game, but this team was able to limit those sacrifices to the graphics department and kept everything else about Ready 2 Rumble intact.  Sound Yet another part of R2R that was translated way better than we expected it to be. The original theme music is in there, Buffer's vaguely familiar catch phrase and nearly perfect introductions are all in there. The fighters themselves all have multiple taunts and off the wall comments just like you remember from the Dreamcast original. Everything is in there thank goodness but doesn't have quite the same pop to it because of the N64's weak sound processing capabilities.   When you're in the training mode, there's a little part where you have to hit buttons in a sequence and on rhythm. The game, even on the N64, sounds good enough that you will feel yourself, a human being, learning the rhythm of the game and what it takes to be a fluid R2R boxer. Very impressive.   The dilemma I'm faced with here is whether or not R2R on the N64 is just a cheap knockoff of a better Dreamcast version or if the N64 game is doing what it can and making the most of the system. Because I was mainly disturbed by the clunky visuals and everything else seemed to be so well done, I opt for the latter. If R2R for the N64 came up short in several areas like running at an unplayable framerate or a loony control system then I would've attributed it to a lack of effort. That is not the case with this game however. The pared down graphics are totally understandable and the rest of the game sings just like the original on the Dreamcast. This is not a low budget version of a great game, it's the best boxing title on the console that takes advantage of what the Nintendo 64 can do. Would I recommend the N64 version over the Dreamcast Ready 2 Rumble? Absolutely not. If you want a finger blistering, sweaty brow, head-to-head fighting game for you N64, run out and pick this one up.", "date": "Nov 13, 1999"}
