Man, you thought there were a lot of Street Fighter IIs? You ain't seen nothing yet.   Redundancy aside, there are very serious things one should know about Super Bust-A-Move. Once you own a Bust-A-Move title, you might as well kiss significant hours of your life away. You may miss work, you may miss your date with the hottest chick in town, and you may indeed forget to go to sleep. While there is nothing terribly extraordinary about Super Bust-a-Move, the game is just as addictive and crazy-making as it ever was.   Gameplay The game really hasn't changed since its inception, but for the record and for the Nth time, I'll tell you about Super Bust-A-Move. Players face a vertical slate filled with different colored bubbles lined up at the top of the screen. At the bottom of the screen is a dial with a pointer that shoots out similar colored balls, which you control by moving the dial left to right. As you shoot these balls onto the existing lineup, over time they whole set of them moves down a notch. You must clear the slate by connecting three (or more) like colored balls before they come crashing down on you.   Likened to a reverse Tetris, Super Bust-A-Move grabs gamers in with simple colors and an even simpler game concept, and then runs, or in some cases ruins, their lives. See, the thing is, behind the flat, 2D characters and the circus music is one of the most ingenious games ever created. The game is great in any single-player mode, but its true brilliance lies in the two-player mode. Requiring skilled hand-eye coordination, Super Bust-A-Move necessitates accurate shooting, a good sense of geometry (in the same sense that pool relies on knowing good angles), and a quick-draw finger.   Super Bust-A-Move has not made the leap to 3D. Instead, it's remained firmly in flat funny 2D characters and backgrounds. The game includes Training, Normal, and Classic modes, and a two-player mode. There is very little difference between the Normal and Classic modes, except that you'll find the classic modes have game patterns you may have seen before, while the Normal modes contains several variations of bubble challenges. They are definitely worth playing, definitely worth beating, and they will increase your skills against another human player. We recommend you play through each of the modes to get a real feel for this game, and then go out and challenge a worthy competitor.   Here at IGN we have had numerous contests over the years -- and it has been years of about 10 or so versions of Bust-A-Move since it first forayed onto PlayStation from the arcades -- and the masters still remain Jeff Chen (former IGNPSX and Saturnworld editor) and tied for second place are Leah Reich and Julian Rignall. Any time I boot up Bust-A-Move and Jeff Chen walks by, we usually waste 20 minutes to an hour before going back to um, ~work.~   But, in the end, with the additions of little bowling balls, neat little characters, and various new pattern sets, Super Bust-A-Move is exactly like it was back in the day. The formula has remained unchanged. And even though I personally am in favor of change, in cities, life, world politics, and in games, Bust-A-Move is still perfect, so why change it?   Graphics The way in which the game's graphics change is sort or like the way you or I might change our wallpaper. It doesn't affect the bathroom at all, but as you're sitting there taking that big, long poop, you will inevitably notice the different patterns on the wall. Only in Super Bust-A-Move you don't really even have that much time.   Two more things. First, the character design, which has no effect on the game, is made up of several new characters, all of whom are strangely simplistic and imagined on such a way that blends strains of '70s patterns with Jetson-infused space age streamlined shapes with a very Japanese sensibility. In other words, it's freaky. And the most affronting of the characters is without a doubt Pukadon, an oversized, hairless, shell-less turtle guy. Pukadon projects a giant Shmoo-type thing from his lower belly that is just too damn close to call anything but a pud with a face on it. And somehow it's cute. Taito's developers are weird, yet amazing. The other characters are Mog, Catch, Pinky, Miss T., Mr. @, Wolo, and Tom and Yam. Each has their own attack pattern, too.   Second, with all the power of the PS2, Taito has managed to create a simple, 2D game that has significantly noticeable load times. That's rubbish! Stream those textures! Make it fast! There aren't any polygons or textures in the game, man! Get with it!   Sound The game has changed very little from its Japanese origins. The music has stayed the same, and so have almost all of the voices...which means the voices are still in Japanese. I guess that it really doesn't matter because you could play the game without any voices at all. The sound effects are as adorable and squeaky clean cute as they ever were, and they're so cute you will find yourself saying them to yourself after a game, knowing not you speak. Any system, another Bust-A-Move. The cycle continues, and it's forgiveable. Why? Because much like Tetris, Bust-A-Move is a nearly perfect formula. However, Super Bust-A-Move delivers nothing new to anyone who hasn't played the game before, so don't get too excited. If you already own a system and a Bust-A-Move game, you don't need this. But if you are new to the PS2 and you want a fun, violence-free game that you can play with at a party or by yourself, or with just a friend, you should get this. The only way it could be better is if there were a simultaneous four-player mode.", "date": "Dec 7, 2000"}
