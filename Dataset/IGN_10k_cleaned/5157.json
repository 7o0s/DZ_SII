It gives new meaning to those who are in search of lawns that seem to go forever, gently beautified with sand pits and watery pools. It's a serene zen thing and it gets better when whacking a little white ball all over it in search of an itty bitty hole. With the real-life thing convincing some to plunk down tens of thousands a year in pursuit of the perfect excuse to drink scotch in the morning with some friends it's a definite must for a videogame version. This leads us, naturally, right into Outlaw Golf 2, Global Star's sequel to the original, and only, bad boy golf sim.   In pursuing the goal of making a wacky golf sim, Outlaw Golf 2 provides some interesting courses with some sound physics modeling and throws in 10 bizarre golfers, each with a matching caddy. It's with these golfers that the main goal of Outlaw Golf 2 appears which is to make some over-the-top caricatures and have a few laughs at their expense. To wrap up this experience, Dave Attell from the Comedy Central show ~Insomniac~ provides some voiceovers. The result is plenty of wisecracking and antics from the golfers.    A Quick Laugh  When seeing the whole Outlaw Golf 2 thing for the first time and hearing the introductions for each of the golfers the game starts out looking pretty freakin' funny. But be sure to cherish that moment because it will be fleeting indeed. After hearing about El Suave's appeal to ladies and androgynous men for the fifth time it's way more than old, it's a reason to remove the dialogue completely. If you even make it that far, I'd be so impressed that I'd buy you a Snickers bar because you'll be needing a pick me up by then.     Since the dialogue goes into commentary on every hole as well as almost every shot and even announcing that it's each characters ~first shot~ and then the ~second shot~ and so on so that this has to be a case study in the perils of putting too much voiceover into one game. No matter how funny any of the jokes are (and most of them aren't) any comedic bit gets horrible when repeated endlessly. It just feels like the game is too in love with itself to just be a golf game.    Another wacky tidbit here is the inclusion of the Composure Meter which can affect gameplay and, sadly, cannot be turned off. By shanking a shot off into the rough or dropping the ball into a hazard the meter will veer left into the red. This makes the max distance on the shots decrease. By getting some good shots that are on target the meter will go to the right and the distance increases. If the meter goes way to the left the best option is to initiate a beating of the caddy. By doing well on a timing mini-game, the golfers enter into a beating animation and improve the composure dramatically. It's all funny for once, maybe twice, but like many other features here it can be easily skipped.   Yet another addition is that each of the golfers has an animation for getting an eagle or a birdie or par, etc. The golden rule for these little victory dances is that they should be one or two seconds, tops. Push it much farther than that and it gets into ~constant skip~ territory where players race to get past the humorous cutscenes. While I'm not really sure whether or not this golden rule has ever been printed, Outlaw Golf pretty much ignores it anyway and provides plenty of animations that are funny, oh, maybe once.     Even while playing the through the single-player game there are several times when the game flat out refuses to go any faster. When the computer gets up to go the player is forced to watch it slowly aim the shot pull back for the swing and follow through. Only once the ball has been hit can the whole thing be skipped. This may not sound like much, but on a few rounds with three other computer golfers the time between shots is at least 20 seconds if not 30 or, this is true, more than 40 seconds. That's 40 seconds while tapping the buttons as fast as humanly possible to get the chance to play again. Some games have a couple of bathroom break moments (Metal Gear Solid, we're looking at you), but this game has them all the time.    What About the Game?  What's even more frustrating about all of this filler in the gameplay is that the game itself is pretty fun and a decent golf game at that. Doing well in the game is a matter of aiming the ball well and nailing the timing challenge of the swing itself. When setting up a shot a yellow arrow shows the path of the ball's flight without the effect of the wind or any indication of which way it will roll on the ground. Once the desired power and club has been selected the screen shows a power bar with the target hit power showing up as a white line. Pulling back on the right analog stick starts the power meter and pushing forward lets it loose. Push too far left or right and the ball will hook or slice and foul everything up and lose some composure.   While the swing is pretty forgiving in terms of just how far left and right you can safely go, the timing isn't. This means that all the careful planning in the world can lead up to a ball going way too far if you're not careful. With the ability to get a topographical layout of any part of the course, getting the shots done right is a matter of skill and preparation. Get both of them right and the game feels just as it should with a few tricky courses to provide a challenge.    There are eight courses in Outlaw Golf 2, three of which are revamped versions of courses from the original. While at times the courses can be pretty traditional, they can also get pretty liberal with the use of obstacles. One course has freeway overpasses that go over the course. The balls need to be hit over or under and cause plenty of headaches for those who try to just power along. The same thing is true for other holes with rock bridges or an Old West movie set with prop buildings that have just the front and nothing behind them.    All of this silliness gets even weirder in the Mini-Golf course. This is not a putt-putt course with windmills, but instead includes a bunch of holes that have obstacles that need to be avoided, like gigantic mushrooms, or even banked off of, like the big castle with the convenient wall at a 45 degree angle for taking an extremely tight turn to get by some trees. Still, like a lot of other Mini-Golf courses, these are fun for a little while, but it's really the seven other courses that fill up most of the game.    Computer Assist  Just in case everything gets too daunting, there's always the generous help that's dished out. Players get one ghost ball and three putting previews to help them make that perfect shot. The ghost ball shows exactly how a ball with the current aim, spin, and power will fly through the course. It's an extremely generous offer from the game and makes much of the aiming incredibly easy. Of course, there's still that tricky issue of nailing the timing which can throw even these plans out of whack and lead to some bad composure.   Even more computer help is done with the putting. Players get three previews that show the exact line of the path the ball will take with the current direction and power. Again, it's key to remember that the execution can still foul things up, but this is a pretty ridiculous amount of help and would be excellent for a beginner's game, which all of Outlaw Golf 2 pretty much is, but not one for those who want to take the game a little more seriously.    Mode-mania  To make the game more interesting there are plenty of different ways to play the game of golf and they bring a little extra flavor, but they don't truly expand the game or really make it that much more exciting to play. At the core, the many different modes are subtly different ways of trying to get the ball in the hole better than anyone else. The Tour mode requires players to go through several different modes in the pursuit of happiness and more trashy outfits and trashy characters. No matter what, though, the urge to play a fun round of golf is king and these extras don't add up to all that much.    Online Greens  The most interesting attribute of Outlaw Golf 2 is the ability to go online and trash talk with others. Since the gameplay is a little easier than other titles out there and there are the generous computer assists, this is more of an enticement for some casual golfing gamers. The best part abut this is that golfers can play rounds simultaneously. Instead of waiting to see every shot (this is still possible), players can play at the same time and see shot lines that show how everyone else is doing. If this method was incorporated into the regular game it would have made the single-player game vastly better, but at least it's in here somewhere.Bringing the thugs, the strippers, the spoiled brats, and other freaks to the next round of Outlaw Golf has seen the game grow in terms of amount of things to do, but it's still stagnating in terms of overall game design. If the humor was more a part of the game than just something that's laughed at once or twice and hurried past, then this would have been an improved installment. As it is, there are still many pacing problems such as the 20-40 second waits for times to just play the game.All of it points right to a title that is hitting the shelves as a budget title and deservedly so. It's frustrating since the basic golfing game is well done and fun when it's allowed to happen. Outlaw Golf 2 is still a pretty good time for a little while and especially improves when played with other people in person or online, but it keeps getting held back by the same attributes it adds that become more like stumbling blocks as the jokes get old and the animations have been seen too many times. With the $19.99 price tag, it's still a good deal, but there are plenty of reasons to keep on looking", "date": "Oct 23, 2004"}
