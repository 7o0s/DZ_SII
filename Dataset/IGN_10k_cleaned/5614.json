Gamers who like turn-based strategy games have more limited options. Wargaming.net's futuristic game Domination helps to broaden the selection somewhat. This hex-based game is the follow-up to wargaming.net's Massive Assault. Little has changed here in terms of gameplay but Domination does offer up loads of new single player content and a few new tweaks to the game's graphics.  There are two massive campaigns here, one for the evil Phantom League, one for the goodie-two-shoes Free Nations Union. Though each side has some key philosophical differences, the differences between their available units are almost entirely cosmetic. Almost all of the units on a given side has an equivalent on the other side; the FNU mortar is exactly the same as the League's scorcher unit, the bomber is the same as the pteroplane, etc. The few differences between the sides are that the League has a few extra super units and an aerial transport, while the FNU has an attack copter and an amphibious battle platform. While these small differences can affect your strategies a bit, both sides play pretty much identically.  The World at War game type is much more interesting. Fought over a variety of planets, it makes great use of Domination's new ~secret allies~ concept. Each side is allowed to disclose a set number of territories as allies during the course of the game. This is a great way to suddenly surprise your enemy by launching an attack from an unpredictable direction. Territories that aren't allied with either player are fair game for invasion but once you invade a neutral territory, the neutral garrisons will go over to the side of your enemy. While it's a nice way to balance the game, it makes it impossible to actually surprise an enemy.  The two campaigns and World at War modes offer up loads of missions, but there's also a Career mode that lets you advance from lowly peon in your army to the head cheese of the whole operation. There's a story that goes along with these missions but it's as ridiculous as it is forgettable. After a few hours, you'll probably just skip past all the exposition to get right to the action. The missions in the campaign (and in the rest of the game) are short enough that you can get your fix very quickly. There are a variety of standalone single missions as well if the commitment of the overall campaign is too much for you.   The missions typically involve completely eliminating the opposition but there are a few missions that have more limited objectives. In some cases you'll have to capture a key enemy installation. In other cases you may simply have to hold out against a stronger enemy force for a set number of turns. Naturally, the scripted missions tend to be a little more predictable but the unique objectives still make them fun to try.  Like most great strategy games, Domination is relatively transparent. You'll know the capabilities of each and every unit on the map. You'll know for instance that an enemy tank can take five hits before being destroyed and that it can deal two points of damage to any adjacent unit. This makes the game much more tactical by taking the guesswork and luck completely out of the game. Planning is key here. There are ~rewind~ and ~undo~ buttons here so you can take back poorly planned moves.  Though the game's multiplayer options definitely prolong the life of the title, the fact that you have to pay $6.95 a month to play online is sure to discourage plenty of gamers, particularly when there are still quite a few viable online TBS games. Domination softens the blow by offering up four month's worth of play for free but once this free period has expired, I wouldn't be motivated to start paying to play.  By the standards of most turn-based strategy games Domination's graphics are pretty good. Titles in this genre have always lagged behind their real-time strategy brothers in terms of appeal and, while Domination is no exception, it's still one of the better looking turn-based strategy games around. The 3D graphics let you get a look at the action from almost any angle. The game's ~fancy camera~ option zooms in tight for key moments, primarily the arrival of reinforcements or the destruction of important units.  The details in the world are quite good. The wide variety of trees and rock formations that dot the landscapes add a lot of life to the maps. Urban maps are similarly detailed. The textures on the ground are a little sloppy but you'll only notice them when you're zoomed in on the action. I also like the units; they're well designed with fairly lively animations. Seeing the artillery units deploy for firing is pretty exciting. Weapons fire and explosions also have their own great effects.  The music and sound effects are unimpressive at best. While I think the various weapon sounds and explosions are effective, they're still a bit generic and thin. The same is true of the basic unit sounds. The rolling tanks and swooping helicopters just aren't terribly convincing. By far the biggest offender on the sound front is the terrible voice acting. Listening to these robotic voices will actually have you questioning whether the voices come from real people or actual voice synthesizers.  Domination feels more like a mission pack or an expansion than a full-on sequel. It manages to add a few new features but it still feels a bit too much like the previous game. If you already own Massive Assault, you won't find that the sequel offers anything more than extra missions. Whether or not these extra missions are worth it depends on how much you value the forty-dollar buy in. Players who havne't yet experienced Massive Assault have a better reason to check out Domination. In any case, the lack of turn-based strategy games these days makes Domination a more attractive prospect, even with the weaknesses in the story and the occasional bugs.", "date": "Mar 22, 2005"}
