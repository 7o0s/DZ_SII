{"name": "Syndicate Wars", "name_review": "Syndicate Wars", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/07/16/syndicate-wars", "text": "Syndicate Wars, when released for the PC, suffered in comparison to two other strategy giants, Command & Conquer and War Craft. However, the game offered enough strong elements and differences to warrant a closer look. However, this PlayStation version falls short of the mark on control, swerving the game away from the attention it deserves.  You control four members of a large and powerful syndicate with tentacles in all aspects of the world. You are assigned missions by the syndicate, generally falling into three categories: kill someone, persuade a person or group to join your syndicate, or (our favorite) blow something up.   The game has amazing atmosphere, with dark, densely populated city blocks and fully modeled cities. Everything is interactive, from the citizens right down to the shrubs and street signs. Don't like the look of that guy over there? Mow him down. That tree giving you a problem? Burn it. It's this element of Syndicate Wars that is so fun. The cities feel alive.  However, the game's greatest problem lies in the control. This is always a problem when converting strategy games from PC to PlayStation, with its low-button count controller. It's not impossible though, as evident by C&C for the PSX and other titles. Here, it's extremely difficult to grab hold of your man and get him to move. There's no point-and-click icon, which is sorely missed. Syndicate Wars could've been a great strategy console title. As it is, though, the frustrating aspect of the control drops it to mediocre.", "date": "Jul 16, 1997"}
