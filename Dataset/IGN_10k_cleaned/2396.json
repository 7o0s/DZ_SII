{"name": "Planet of the Apes", "name_review": "Planet of the Apes", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/19/planet-of-the-apes", "text": "is a cult film classic from 1968.  The premise is simple enough: astronauts crash land on a planet they believe to be a foreign world overrun with talking apes and mute humans.  Turns out it was earth all along and Charlton Heston is left pounding his fist into the sand, screaming at the top of his lungs.  Oh, and he nabs himself a mute babe (and I mean babe) named Nova.  It's every man's dream.  Well, except for the whole ape planet thing.  The game loosely follows the second movie in the series, Beneath the Planet of the Apes. You play earthling Ben, journeying to the Planet of the Apes in search of lost Colonel Taylor.  Apes strives to do the movie series justice, but is just too easy and ends too quickly to achieve that goal. Features Based on the original Ape movies Ten levels to explore Password Save Only for Game Boy Color Apes is a side-scroller reminiscent of the Genesis gem Flashback.  You can run, jump, climb ledges, and wreak a furious vengeance on some apes.  This game is almost identical to the Game Boy Advance version.  As a warning, there are some contrast problems when you play this on the GBA.  Obviously, this game was designed to be used on the GBC, so if you want to play Apes on a GBA, get the Advance version.  When I say the game is nearly identical, I mean it.  The animations are the same and though the level designs are slightly different, they are very similar.  The gameplay is pretty simplistic.  There are no puzzles to open unreachable areas, just a lot of jumping and climbing.  The enemies you meet (which are anything from snakes to bears to ape warriors) walk a repetitive short path.  Killing your victims or avoiding them altogether is not difficult.  In fact, sometimes you can slash an ape with your knife, doing damage, and they will turn their back to you and keep walking their predestined path.  It's not until halfway through the game that the apes stop whacking at you with clubs and start shooting with machine guns.  Your own arsenal is not impressive at first.  For the first few levels you will only have a knife.  Once you finally get a gun, the bad guys become all too easy to dispatch.  The goal of each level is to get from point A to point B, killing when necessary and collecting ten flags left by Taylor.  There's nothing complicated here, it's just a matter of execution.  Still-frame cut scenes have been inserted between a handful of levels.  They help to progress the story and there is even a twist ending worthy of an Apes movie.  These scenes are short but help add to the mood of the game.  They're easy to dismiss, but without them the game would be forgettable.  Torus Games may have made a simple game, but they certainly did their job keeping the feel of the movies.  The dialogue seems true to the characters, I just wish the platform design was more challenging.  The action in Apes doesn't change over the ten levels.  You jump, you shoot, you avoid spikey floors.  The levels never gain in difficulty.  Since there's no difficulty setting, you're stuck with the easy levels.  Apes fails to be dynamic.  It's linear, it's easy, and once it's over you won't need to play it again.  The levels in Apes take you through the desert, the jungle, Ape City, and even the beach where Taylor damned them all to hell (humans that is, the apes he got to liking).  The levels look nice on the GBC with each of the areas looking distinct.  The animations are limited, but they get the job done.  The enemies seem very stiff, but the main character, Ben, is fluid.  As for sound, the effects lack any real thunder and those damn dirty apes listen to the same damn dirty song all day long.  The music is great the first level.  Then you hit the second level and it's the same thing.  And the next level, it hasn't changed.  And again.  And again.  It's nice of Nintendo to include volume control on the GBC. Planet of the Apes is a decent side-scroller that fails to truly impress.  The game is very singular in goal, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so short.  I am a big fan of the Apes movies and it was great to see that the developers at Torus Games had actually watched the films and incorporated some of the story elements throughout.  If you want a quick ride through the Planet of the Apes, go ahead and pick up the game.  You won't be playing it for long.  Again, if you have a GBA, get the GBA version.", "date": "Dec 19, 2001"}
