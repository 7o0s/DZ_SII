Probably not, given the number of 'unsung hero' awards the game won, which is a polite way of saying it was badly marketed. Apparently, then-publisher Vivendi concentrated its efforts on Van Helsing, which turned out to be a case of terrible film, terrible game, as opposed to Riddick, which was also an abysmal film but a fantastic game. Indeed, it's arguably among the original Xbox's finest 10 hours - even if most of them were spent in the dark.   Buoyed by the critical - if not commercial - success of Riddick, Swedish developer Starbreeze Studios quietly embarked on its next project, coincidentally also involving a considerable lack of light. New publisher Take 2 was determined that this one wouldn't be overlooked though and The Darkness has been one of the most hyped games of the past year.   The snakeheads can be used to attack and also solve puzzles.  By now you're probably sick to death of reading that it's based on an obscure comic (sorry, graphic novel) and that mafia hitman Jackie Estacado celebrates his 21st birthday by undergoing a demonic possession, as opposed to a skinful and a fight. You've no doubt seen the screenshots of those bizarre heart-devouring twin snakeheads, of the great big tentacles growing out of his back and of the so-called Darklings that Jackie can summon to do his bidding.   However, if you have somehow managed to avoid the hype the scenario is outlined in a lengthy opening sequence, which also sets the tone with a brutal vehicle-based decapitation a couple of minutes in. At this stage, if you didn't know anything about the game you could be forgiven for thinking you'd stumbled into an interactive Sopranos sequence, given the New York Italiano setting, the amount of foul and abusive language and the number of people called Paulie.   It soon takes a darker twist though, as Jackie begins to realise the extent of his dark powers. Indeed, coming to terms with these skills takes some practice, even at the very beginning when he discovers the Creeping Darkness, whereby one of his snakeheads takes off independently. This enables you to control it as it slithers off in search of someone's crotch to bite, but it's an occasionally unwieldy business particularly if you crawl up a wall, because it's hard to distinguish between up and down.   Aiming can be a bit hit and miss, plus your enemies are surprisingly resilient.  You will need to get to grips with it though, as simply running in all guns blazing is rarely a successful approach. The shooting is a mix of dual pistols, machineguns and shotguns - albeit with slightly twitchy crosshairs - and enemies who insist on getting back up once you've shot them. You're often better off using your guns to shoot out the lights, thus enabling you to skulk in the shadows and recoup your darkness powers.   As for the Darklings, the four different types become available as the game progresses. The initial Berserker is an all-purpose affair, able to attack enemies and open doors, whereas the Gunner is more specialised, handy with a mini-gun but fatally allergic to light. Next up is the Kamikaze - effectively a walking bomb - and finally the Light Killer, which can Harness electricity. While the Darklings are a useful addition to your armoury, particularly when you run out of ammo, the AI isn't all it might be and sometimes they get in the way when you're trying to do your slithery snake thing. They are representative of the game's bizarre humour though, shouting out non-sequiturs such as ~7-2 off-suit,~ which is of course the worst opening hand in poker.     The game as a whole is riddled with strange attempts at comedy, which are sometimes incongruous given the underlying themes of demonic possession and eternal damnation. Even weirder are the almost Shenmue-like levels of irrelevance, particularly as regards television. There's an early sequence where Jackie visits his girlfriend's flat, and they both sit on the sofa and start watching telly. She refuses to let him have the remote control and unless you storm out immediately you are forced to watch the best part of the opening hour of seminal racial drama To Kill A Mocking Bird, starring Gregory Peck. While it's undeniably a moving film, you have to question whether this is the time and the place, particularly as once it's started you can't get up, and have no choice but to restart from the previous checkpoint. On the plus side, it's probably the ten easiest Achievement Points you'll ever earn.   One minute you're in Noo Yoik, the next you're in the trenches of World War One...  The madness continues when you slaughter a roomful of mob guys using your tentacles and pet goblins, then calmly sit down and watch the original black & white version of Flash Gordon. You can also pick up a phone, dial a random number and get an earful of abuse. This sort of thing suggest either that Starbreeze has an eye for detail, or that they finished the bulk of the game some time ago and have been desperately passing the time. Either way, it gives the game a near unprecedented level of quirkiness.   As for the main action, visually and stylistically, the closest comparison on 360 is probably Condemned, although The Darkness is nowhere as psychologically terrifying. Perhaps due to the ludicrous scenario and over-the-top voice acting it simply isn't scary, and the main sensation it induces is panic as you desperately try to run for cover with your ridiculous tentacles flapping all over the place.   In fact it's actually as much a love story as a horror story, although this rapidly changes when you get shot and wake up in the trenches of World War I. No kidding, one minute you're having a stand-off with your uncle Paulie, the next you're chasing a Nazi with a nasty case of trench foot. This sizeable twist is apparently in the comics, and is supposed to represent hell on earth, enabling you to come closer to the mystery of just why you have half an octopus on your back.   The Gunner Darkling can mow down the enemy but keep him away from the light.  It's admittedly a seismic shift of events, but one that is in keeping with the overriding strangeness of the game. As well as being a unique mix of shooting and demonology, by this stage you're actually interested in the story, not least to see what madness it throws up next.   After all the hype youd be forgiven for thinking there were no more surprises left, but The Darkness throws up a few treats. The inclusion of The Darkness powers and the ability to summon Darklings adds a fresh dimension to the shooter genre, plus the tempo of the action is fast enough to keep you hooked all the way through. Its a shame the multiplayer games feels so tacked on  although the option to play as a Darkling is neat. Despite this The Darkness is one of the more original shooters of this or indeed any year.", "date": "Jun 22, 2007"}
