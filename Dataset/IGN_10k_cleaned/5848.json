{"name": "Mafia Wars [2004]", "name_review": "Mafia Wars", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/27/mafia-wars", "text": "American pop culture has embraced the Mafia -- romanticized organized crime has never looked better through the eyes of Hollywood, save for the warts-and-all ~Sopranos.~ Sumea, part of the Digital Chocolate family, has taken on a snippet of the mythos -- the high-rolling 1920s -- for the setting of their action/adventure game. You are a young hoodlum yearning to work your way up through the ranks of the mob. The best way to reach the top of La Costa Nostra is via successfully performing a series of jobs at the Don's request.   Your reputation and ranking is directly affected by your actions. For example, every time you slaughter a handful of brown-suited rival gang members, your stature increases. Every time you complete a mission -- usually resulting in death and mayhem -- you get a bump in the family tree.   The story of Mafia Wars unfolds over seven missions, laid out in a linear fashion. You unlock new missions when you complete previous tasks. Each mission has a little story that fits into the overall arc, which might not contain any surprises, but is certainly appreciated.   There is a depth to Mafia Wars that is definitely appreciated, too. The levels are large and intricately designed, full of buildings you can step into, even if official business doesn't require you to do so. (Some of these buildings contain health power-ups, so if you've taken a few slugs, it's best to become downright neighborly.) There is a map that shows you the general lay-out, as well as where you and your targets are located. In later missions, this is incredibly helpful, as there are ways to get lost.   As you attempt to conquer the streets, you must mind your weapon. Walking around with a tommy gun, shotgun, or pistol will attract the unwanted attention of the cops. Killing civilians will also land you in hot water, so that should be avoided unless you want to make your rep as a maniac.   There is a secondary game mode, too, called Last Man Standing. This is a pure action game where you must drop screen after screen of gangsters in an effort to be, well, the last man standing.   The action elements work pretty well, save for the auto-aim feature that is a tab too temperamental. When you have your gun drawn and you are facing an enemy, a target will appear over them to let you know you can shoot. The problem is getting lined-up properly enough to make your shot, especially in later missions when the screen is a little more littered with enemy gangsters. It can get frustrating, waiting for the target to appear when you see blood pouring out of your own bullet wounds.   The game is kinda violent -- but that's what you would expect from a game called Mafia Wars. Blood spurts from gunshot wounds. Barrels of whiskey or period cars explode when shot, resulting in damaging flames. Burning enemies will run around in a panic when caught in the blast radius.  Mafia Wars is a pretty tight little package. The two game modes are solid. Last Man Standing is good for lightning-fast game sessions, while the story mode will fill a fifteen minute break without a problem. I wish the game moved a little faster, especially considering the size of some of the levels. Getting through a mission can take longer than it should just because it takes so long to walk to your objective. However, I enjoyed the bits with keeping your weapon hidden until need, the easily explored real estate, and the mission structure.", "date": "Jun 27, 2005"}
