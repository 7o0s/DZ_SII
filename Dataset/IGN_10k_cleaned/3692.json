Though the game certainly wowed new purchasers with a rather impressive 3D engine  and a very capable music soundtrack, the gameplay ended up extremely flat and awkward behind-the-ship perspective that just didn't work all that well. The development team went back to the drawing board for the sequel, Iridion II, and while it shares similarly impressive graphic and sound capabilities, the game itself is a complete redesign from Iridion 3D. And what's more, the sequel is a far more successful action game because the designers rooted the design with 2D gameplay that makes the game much more accessible and drastically more fun than the original game. Features Five worlds, fifteen levels Story, Arcade, and Challenge modes Hidden gallery and jukebox Internet Ranking at www.iridion2.com Password save (five characters) Only for Game Boy Advance  For those folks who picked up the original Iridion 3D, forget what you've seen and played. For those who haven't, prepare yourself for a game that brings back some of the magic and fun of the classic space shooter genre that's sort of died off over the years. The game is definitely inspired by shooters on the SNES and Genesis, as it mixes many successful design elements from games such as Thunderforce, Gradius and Axelay...just to name a few. But it really looks and feels like its own game, especially thanks to the designers clever GBA engine, faking a 3D perspective by rendering a small animation of a corridor, looping it seamlessly to give the impression of an ongoing trench. The developers then paste interactive 2D and 3D elements on top of this trench, matching the scrolling speed to give the different environments an incredible illusion of depth. And the accompanying soundtrack is some of the best in a Game Boy Advance action title; not that we were expecting anything less, since Shin'en has provided soundtracks to several noteworthy GBA projects over the years.  There's a reason why scrolling shooters aren't really that popular anymore: variety. There's not a whole lot that can be done differently besides enemy and location designs. And while Iridion 3D does fall into that one-trick-pony category, it's a pony that does its trick extremely well.  Collecting power-ups will give the player the ability to activate more powerful weaponry, but they can freely cycle between the six different weapons categories once they've boosted their ability at least once with a power-up. Each of the weapons has its own style of attack, and some enemies and structures can be taken out more easily with one type than another...switching back and forth between the weapons is key to the gameplay.  The ship in Iridion II isn't a ~one-hit wonder~ where a single shot will take it out; players have a shield that gets whittled down by enemy fire and environment collisions, so taking a few hits might be harmful, but it's not devastating. Most importantly, though, the game never really gets ~unfair~ like in some shooter designs; ever play one where they throw out an insane amount of enemies that unleash ten thousand bullets across the screen, with no possible way of escaping? Iridion 3D's design doesn't resort to cheap tactics like that. Sure, there are enemies that throw out a decent number of bullets to avoid, but here's the kicker: you can avoid them. Players will have to rely more on their skills and memory of the level's layout to succeed than just blind luck.  After each level, players earn a password so they can continue on after powering down the system. The password is only five characters, so it's not that big of a deal, but having no cartridge save means that all the statistics that you accumulate in a level, such as time completed, shots fired, enemies killed, gets pretty much thrown out the window. The designers add an Internet Ranking function to the arcade mode where players can post their scores to the Iridion 2 website, which is a fantastic inclusion...but it still doesn't help folks who want to carry around their other personal statistics so they can replay the level and beat those recorded scores. Scrolling shooters aren't the most versatile of videogames, and it's true that there's not a whole lot of technique in Iridion II. But what is here is extremely challenging and a lot of fun on the Game Boy Advance. It's a far, far better design than the original Iridion 3D, which, in retrospect, we might have rated a smidge too highly when it first came out...hey, an impressive 3D engine in a first generation game can do that to a reviewer. Iridion 3D gives folks the best of both worlds: the awesome graphics, and the challenging, approachable gameplay. And for a retail price of 15 bucks, the game is a steal.", "date": "Jun 3, 2003"}
