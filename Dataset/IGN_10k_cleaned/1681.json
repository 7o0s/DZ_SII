N-Space, then, might want to think about getting the jack out of the trunk, because neither the previously-reviewed Danger Girl or their second Duke Nukem adventure, Land of the Babes (the subject at hand) are going to do anything but keep their wheels kicking up sand.  There is actually a fair amount of game here, but why would anyone want to play it?  Anyone with taste, anyway.  Land of the Babes does not look good, it does not play very well, and Duke's attitude has aged like the old Brie cheese that's been in my fridge for a couple of months now.  I want to be rid of it, but I have to solve the problem of simply touching it first.  Gameplay  If memory serves, much hay was made during Time to Kill's development about the ~Duke Raider~ project codename, but this doesn't actually play a lot like Tomb Raider.  It's more like MERC Standard Issue 3D Action.  Although to be fair, Duke does share Lara's bollixed jumping animation, the Time to Kill engine is a bit better than its purported inspiration when it comes to movement and camera control.  Duke doesn't get stuck behind things quite so often, and he strafes and leaps more nimbly.  And then what?  Well, find the key, open the door, shoot the mutant rat-things.  The TR-esque jumping makes the occasional platforming challenge a bona fide pain in the neck.  Other situations are a little too easy, though - since Duke can automatically lock on to the nearest enemy, he can clear rooms with ease, and the alien AI doesn't offer up much that would outweigh his tactical advantage.  Graphics  The world of the future that Duke is supposed to be saving is simply modeled and garishly textured, much like the man himself.  The framerate is generally solid, although it falls down into the chop zone with the introduction of too many enemies, explosions, or lighting effects.  That's a pretty high price for those effects, though, considering what you're getting.  The lighting is basic, the explosions aren't too much to look at, and occasionally you come upon a real howler, like some of the blood effects.  Snipe the head off some cheaply-rendered enemy and the carotid spray coming from the stump had me just about on the floor.  And speaking of character models, they aren't much to speak of, be they mutant-rat enemies or the horde of Daisy Dukes clones that Duke is evidently fighting to save.  The 3D engine isn't as jittery as some, but good grief, some of these people/things/etc. look bad.  The overdone voice acting in the cutscenes is a pretty jarring contrast alongside the things-which-are-people evidently delivering the lines.  Finally, I realize this is a minor point, but has someone at N-Space decided to dedicate their career to the production of wretchedly bad CG full-motion video cutscenes?  I ask because I thought it would take a positively Herculean effort to create CG that I would hate even more than the stuff in Danger Girl, but then along comes Duke's disturbingly stacked Claymationoid supporting cast and I'm running for the exits once more.  This stuff goes all the way through ~Exploitative,~ charges past ~So Exploitative It's A Parody Of Exploitation,~ and careens headlong into ~Good God, I Can't Even Laugh At This.~  Fear Effect 2 makes me feel dirtier, but Land of the Babes is still a respectable second in the PlayStation bad taste awards.  Sound  Be quiet, Duke.  Your shtick is played.  If I want to hear somebody say ~come get some~ repeatedly, I'll ask Dave Z to pop his Army of Darkness DVD into the PS2 - but I'm not liable to get even that far, because I don't want to hear somebody say ~come get some~ repeatedly.  I also don't want to hear any of the rest of Duke's massive library of posturings, or the silly dialogue in the occasional cutscenes.  The musical accompaniment delivers the second shot of the audio one-two punch - boring rock 'n' roll with accents by Static-X, whose uniquely rotten sounds actually rather suit the game's grimly macho character.  So a few points for an appropriate choice of band, but minus several more for making a game unpleasant enough to suit these tunes.Like I say, then, leave this sucker alone.  The recycled engine wasn't all that impressive to begin with, and the aesthetic death-force of whoever it is at N-Space keeps wanting to make these kinds of games couldn't be overcome by any kind of technical achievement.  Syphon Filter, Metal Gear, whatever, if you really need to shoot something on your PlayStation, you can find far superior alternatives to Duke Nukem.  And if you happen to enjoy the Nukem attitude, you stopped taking this review seriously after the first couple of paragraphs, so no harm done there.", "date": "Dec 21, 2000"}
