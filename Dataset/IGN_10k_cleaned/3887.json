That all changed in the mid-90s when Square jumped ship and sided with Sony to exclusively produce its titles on the PlayStation system, forcing fans of the series to seek out new life on new hardware. But after a seemingly agonizing wait, the company has returned to the flock, producing the first Final Fantasy-related game on a Nintendo system in nearly a decade. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, produced entirely by Square but published by Nintendo, is a wonderful RPG-based strategy game with an insane amount of depth, replay value and challenge, and a ton of fun if you're willing to put in the investment of thought and time. Features Dozens of hours of gameplay Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (two slots, one instant-save during battle) Only for Game Boy Advance Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is not a true Final Fantasy game in the RPG series sense, nor is it a sequel or remake of Final Fantasy Tactics released on the PlayStation system several years ago. It's actually a new development that advances the game design of Final Fantasy Tactics, offering brand new gameplay elements in the turn-based strategy design with a completely new tale written specifically for Game Boy Advance gamers. There's no traditional RPG exploration in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance; all gameplay elements take place either via menu selections, or within the isometric combat engine. It's this engine where players will be spending 90 percent of their gameplay time, since this is a strategy game design, first and foremost. If you're expecting and craving for puzzle-solving exploration of the Final Fantasy design, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is not for you. But don't dismiss the game because of its strategy focus, since it's incredibly deep and well-designed. And a heck of a challenge with an incredible amount of replay value.  The storyline, while not as epic as tales within other Final Fantasy games, is solidly written and extremely easy to relate to, but obviously catering to a slightly younger crowd. Players aren't thrust straight into a foreign land with its own creatures and laws to learn as they go along as in most Final Fantasy games; instead, they follow characters from a modern world into a Final Fantasy universe, learning as the characters do. The plot goes something like this: Marche and his schoolyard friends, living in the town of St. Ivalice, stumble upon a book that sets the children's imagination ablaze. The thought that it might be a magical book sends the kids dreaming about living in an alternate world...the world of Final Fantasy, one of the friends' favorite games. While they sleep, the book actually grants the children's wish whether they wanted it to happen or not; whisking them away to a land called Ivalice filled with Moogles, Banga, and adventure-bound humans. Marche is the player's persona in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and the game's storyline revolves around him joining a clan to find his scattered friends, how to return to the ~real world,~ and events that are affecting Ivalice.   Immediately, Marche is put in the role of a clan leader, and it's here that players live out their Final Fantasy life. Players will have to take control of a various band of creatures of various races and jobs, managing their equipment, abilities, and combat skills. Final Fantasy Tactics Advance does a wonderful job weaning players into the combat engine through two cleverly disguised tutorial missions...once in the real world during a snowball fight, and again in the Final Fantasy world after Marche lets a racial remark slip. But as well as these modes give players the basics of combat, it doesn't prepare them for just how much micromanagement is required to keep the clan in tip-top condition; the storyline may be aimed at the younger crowd, but the gameplay is anything but ~kiddie.~  The game's missions come in the form of tasks that must be accepted at various pubs across Ivalice, each one costing a certain amount of coin depending on their importance in the plot, as well as difficulty and rewards attached to them. But honestly, no player will go broke ~buying~ missions since they're on the cheap early in the adventure, and successful missions award tons of money. There are two different types of missions in the game, one of which is called a ~dispatch.~ These dispatch missions are non-controllable, and require players to simply choose the right clan member for the task; there's a bit of strategy involved, since a dispatch mission requires a clan member's attention for a few days...which means he or she won't be available for the standard, player-controlled missions.    And it's this that's the meat of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Battles take place in an angled perspective across a variety of terrain, and players will have to choose among their clan which characters will enter the fight. It's always a one-on-one battle, with players combatting against a computer controlled team; characters take turns, moving across the grid landscape and attacking each other until the task is complete...usually wiping out the entire clan of the other side does the trick. Nearly every move nets the characters experience points, so it's important that players bring in weaker clan members to a battle, even if it's just to use items, or hit and run. Like Final Fantasy or the bazillion of other RPG game designs, experience points will level up characters and enhance their abilities.     The biggest enhancement to the existing Final Fantasy Tactics gameplay is the addition of a Judge. To keep things ~fair~, every encounter requires the participation of a Ivalice judge that keeps watch over the entire battle. The judge keeps track of anyone that either breaks a written law, or follows a recommended law, and it's this element that really throws a ton of strategy in the game design. Players are informed at the beginning of the battle what they cannot do during a mission, and if someone breaks the law they're either penalized, or worse, sent to jail. It's not uncommon to be given a law that prevents the use of swords, or arrows, or utilizing items like potions during a battle, and having a harsh law looming over the battlefield really forces players to think about each and every move they're telling their characters to do.  As expected in a Square game, the artwork and audio focus is splendidly produced in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Though the game definitely doesn't recreate the company's trend of elaborate, rendered cutscenes, the team utilizes the system's strengths and weaknesses to unfold the game's story as well as provide a visually pleasing and sounding gameplay experience. The battle screen does get a little cluttered since the developers reuse the same sprites for specific races, but the designers make it a little easier to follow by giving each character its own look through hand-drawn portraits that appear when the player hovers the cursor over them. Character attacks are well animated, as are some of the over-the-top special moves that can be called up during battle. It wouldn't be a Square game without the extra flair, and the developers of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance come through with a lot of that graphical and aural ~punch.~  The gameplay is certainly easy to get into, but the entire game design is actually very technical when it comes to character abilities. Players must wade through a series of complex menus in order to manage their clan members ~jobs~ (their classification that gives them specific attacks and other abilities), as well as keep track of what items are equipped to the characters. It's greats to have so much control over all of these elements in the game, but it's not so great that the interface has to be so darn cluttered. Menus aren't the easiest to follow in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance; equipping and removing items on characters isn't as easy a task as it is in other RPG-based designs, since it doesn't immediately indicate the pros and cons of possessing specific items. Players will have to remember all of the statistics of a character as they add and remove weapons or armor so they can actually see the changes. This interface just isn't as good as it could have been.  An additional element of strategy comes in the form of customizing the Ivalice map; winning specific missions will let players position specific locations of Ivalice on a custom map. This is a pretty awkward gameplay element since it's never really made clear why players are creating their own map...usually maps are pretty finite things that don't change, but here we are, putting a forest or a town wherever the heck we want to. But positioning locations in specific slots on the map actually reward players with additional items...which is definitely a good thing. Still, it's a very odd feature in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance that seriously feels out of place.  But the sheer amount of strategic gameplay in Final Fantasy Advance Tactics overshadows the small nitpicks of the design. The fact that players can also team up or compete with other owners of the game via the link cable adds another layer of replay to the title.      Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a heck a way for Square to return to the Nintendo scene. The gameplay, while familiar territory thanks to games like Tactics Ogre, offers a lot more elements that increase the strategy and fun to the existing game design. The storyline of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance in particular makes the game a lot more appealing since it's extremely easy to relate to the main characters. The only thing hurting the title is unnecessary ~clutter,~ both in the battle screens and in the menu options; a little clean-up in the interface could have definitely benefited the development. But the good far outweighs the annoyances, and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a highly recommended adventure for the GBA.", "date": "Sep 5, 2003"}
