Ever since it was first previewed long, long ago, I had high expectations. With the exception of Close Combat and the Age of Empires series, there's been very little in the RTS world that has realism as a primary goal. And while Age of Empires was great, it involves a lot of the technology and economy modeling that distracts me from what I really love -- moving armies around. Close Combat gives you that chance, but the scale of the battles is far too small. Sudden Strike looked to change all that with a pure military approach and a scale unsurpassed in the RTS market.  Now the final game has been in my hands for some time now. I've been impressed with a lot of the things that the game does right. The scale is epic, the units are really diverse and the graphics are spectacular. But the game also misses the mark in a few key areas. The missions are kind of ambiguous, the large number of units can get confusing and the game tends to drag along now and then. But overall, I've been impressed and have high hopes that this will inspire other developers to take a similarly fresh approach. But let's get specific.  The first thing that you're confronted with when you venture into the game is the horrible intro movie. I was all set for some heart stirring WWII style movies. Instead, there's this really awful techno frenzy that totally kills the mood of the game...for me, at least. I can respect the decision to shift the focus of the game a little but ultimately it just looks like a bad rip off of the Red Alert approach. Not only that, but it totally doesn't fit with the action of the game itself. And the mission briefings are kind of similar. The voiceover doesn't really suit the mood I expected from the game. Apart from that, the voiceover isn't all that useful for outlining mission objectives and it doesn't help that the various arrows and circles that appear on the map aren't synchronized with the voiceover. And instead of saying ~conquer,~ the guy says ~konkweer.~ He also says ~missun~ instead of ~machine.~  But all these inconsistencies evaporate once the game starts. The units are probably the most commendable part of the game. With well over 100 units, each authentically and realistically rendered, Sudden Strike has one of the most ambitious unit lists in any game. On the infantry side alone you'll be able to take charge of officers, riflemen, flamethrowers, snipers, machine gunners, commandos and a number of other troop types. Each troop type has a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. The problem comes when you're trying to pick your snipers out a crowd of 120 different soldiers. Things are just as varied on the vehicle side as well with a ton of different tanks, cannons, howitzers, jeeps, trucks at your disposal. The fact that you can have as many as 1000 of these units in a given battle is simply staggering (and a little more confusing than it needs to be).  There are also numerous support units. Each unit is rated in terms of health, ammo level and experience. In order to keep the ammo level up, you'll have to send in supply trucks. They can also help repair vehicles. To repair soldiers, you'll need to send in an ambulance. Another cool feature in the game is the chance to man crewed weapons. Your infantry can take charge of abandoned howitzers, fixed machine guns and anti-aircraft defenses. You'll have to make sure that you keep your troops screened from enemy attack however. Once the enemy kills the gun crews, he can take the gun over.  As complicated as commanding 500 units at a time is, the interface is really simple. Nine simple hotkeys control orders and the game uses the same sort of group assignment that's standard in most RTS games. The best thing about the interface is that you can queue orders. Just hold the shift key down and you can line up numerous orders for any given unit. You can have a group of infantry sweep a road clear of mines, man a nearby machine gun, cross a bridge and barricade themselves in a house. Any remaining units can be made to seek cover. All this is handled at one time. Units in Sudden Strike also fire while they're moving which sustains the momentum of the game.  But that's not to say that the gameplay is free of problems. For one thing, the speed of the game is far too slow. Sure some gamers like to take their time with things, but when you're dealing with maps this size, speeding up the action is just about the only way to keep some of us interested. Even on the fastest setting, Sudden Strike moves along at a plodding pace. The pathfinding could also use some help as there are several choke points and barriers that your units must negotiate. On a map this big I'd expect a few problems but when my units can't find their way to the other side of a bridge, there's a problem.  In some ways, the huge amount of units you're asked to play with is a liability as well. I've been in several fights involving hundreds of units only to find a new batch of reinforcements showing up on the side of the map. Taking the time to group all of your reinforcements into effective elements takes a long time and usually you're too preoccupied with killing your enemies to manage it well. Some people might be angry that the game takes force composition completely out of your hands. I am not one of them. The fact that the game assigns you starting units and reinforcements is totally fine with me. There are actually some of us who don't give a crap about the economic aspects of most RTS games.  Moving back to the plus side of things, Sudden Strike has got to have one of the most detailed and authentic looking environments I've ever seen in a 2D RTS. The trees and buildings and rivers and roads are all totally believable. The fact that nearly all of the tiles are deformable is a big plus as well. It's really cool to look back over the areas in which you've fought and see felled trees, collapsed buildings, ruined bridges and lots of potholes and scorch marks. And as I've said before, the maps are, in Vincent's words, Gimungous. It really opens up a lot of strategic options for the player. Scouting actually becomes important and you can choose pretty freely how to approach enemy positions.  Sudden Strike takes a pretty fresh approach to the real-time strategy model. In most cases, it's a success. If there had been a better way to group and select units and if the pace of the game had been increased, then Sudden Strike could easily compete with the best RTS titles on the market. Like I said, I hope the game spurs other developers to take a similar approach. The proven formulas just get repetitive after a while. Sudden Strike isn't everything I hoped it was but it's certainly nice to see the genre moved in a new direction.  -- Stephen Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
