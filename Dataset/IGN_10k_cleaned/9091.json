It was via the PlayStation one demo, and for me at least, it was a revelation. The demo area itself was pretty non-descript, comprised of a warehouse area with bowls, quarter pipes and rails, but it somehow captured the essence of skating - the freedom and the love for tricks. I spent hours and hours just skating around that warehouse, discovering lines and gazing in awe at how perfectly even the most basic flip tricks had been captured. The original Tony Hawk may look primitive today, but that feeling, that excitement about the boundless potential and freedom of skateboarding in a videogame, is back. Its name is skate (and yes, that's how EA want us to write it - no capitalisation).   This is the next generation of skating videogames, no question. While developer Black Box has missed a couple of opportunities (which we'll get to later), skate's core gameplay is nothing short of brilliant, with a learning curve that's so organic and natural that you're constantly improving, and constantly satisfied while doing it. A deep echo of that first infatuation with Tony Hawk, I logged hours and hours in the Xbox Live demo for skate, and even when I got my hands on the full review code, I still continued to just skate, ignoring the structure of the game in favour of simply honing my skills and discovering new lines. After all, why do a mission or a tutorial when you have an entire city to skate and explore?      That kind of innate playability doesn't come along all that often, and in skate's case it's all born from a revolutionary control scheme. Simply put, 'Flickit' is a stroke of genius and emphasises skill and tactile control over button pressing. Think of it this way - the left stick controls the skater, while the right controls the board. To do an ollie, you pull the right stick towards you to put your skater into a crouch, then flick it back up to ollie. The lower your skater's crouch and the harder you flick it, the higher you ollie. All other flip tricks, then, are a logical extension of this mechanic. Flick up and to the left for a kickflip (hold it for a double), roll round then up for a pop shuvit, and so on. Nollie based tricks are all executed by holding up then flicking down, and you can even do late flips in the air by doing the relevant motion before you hit the ground. It makes logical sense, and it means that consistently hitting tricks is easier said than done - true skill and touch is required, especially when you move on to the more complex flicking movements.    Grabs are a slightly different kettle of fish - the left and right triggers represent your left and right hands respectively, with holding a trigger and pushing in a direction dictating what kind of grab you'll do. Simple, but definitely less fun.   As in real-life, manuals are also an important part of skate's arsenal, but again, the mechanics are deft and intuitive. Simply incline the right stick slightly back or slightly forward as you move along and you'll enter into a manual. Simple, right? Yep, but it's when using the manual as part of a sequence that - again - true skill and touch is required. It's no simple thing to 360 hardflip into a manual on a funbox, then 180 frontside heelflip out, and as a result, when you start nailing these kinds of moves there's an immense sense of satisfaction.      Simply put, this is a game for trick-freaks. If you want to get big air or go fast, you will be able to in certain areas and at certain points, but the primary focus is technical skating, and Black Box has nailed it. Absolutely nailed it. Grinds and board slides are just as organic as everything else. There's no button to hit for a grind - it's all about your approach and how you hit the rail or ledge. Helping things along, holding left or right on the right stick in the air turns your board side on, which makes certain slides much easier to get into. In the early game there's nothing more satisfying than approaching a ledge and kickflipping up into a deft noseslide. It's a basic trick but it just feels so right. That's the hallmark of a great sim, and you'll find yourself hitting a certain trick object over and over again, trying to nail a trick, then one-up it.   The mechanics, however, are only a part of what makes skate so compelling. Another important component is the physics system, and the physicality with which your board interacts with the world. While there are certainly elements that are exaggerated, this game really feels like skating. Your board behaves as an independent object that reacts to the world as it should, so when you rail slide a ledge, you're not entering into some magical rail sliding state, you're grinding against the concrete - your board's slipping and you're losing momentum. It may sound like a small thing, but it goes for everything you do in the world, and really adds up. This is complemented by excellent skating animations too - you really get a sense for the way bodyweight is shifted around during tricks and landings, and it's all rounded off with a great array of authentic scraping, screeching and rolling sound effects.    The final element in skate's design tour de force is, of course, level design. Considering how many hours I spent skating around one skate park in the demo, it's almost intimidating to discover just how big San Vanelona is. It spans a huge area of land, covering everything from leafy suburban neighbourhoods through to a dense city centre and the cobble stoned streets of the old town. It has everything a street skater could want too, so while there are some sparse (i.e. boring) sections, this is still a very, very dense city in gameplay terms. There are just so many areas worth sessioning in, from the benches and banks in the school through to the countless sets of stairs and ledges in the city. And it's all tracked by a low, deliberately low-fi camera. No control over the camera for you; skate mimics the effect of having a guy on a board following you, and it works really well. While it doesn't always give you the exact perspective you want, which sometimes makes lining up angles a little tricky, what it does do is make that trick look utterly awesome when you do nail it.   I guess we should probably get around to the actual structure of the game, as I eventually did after hours of skating around. Skate throws up a number of challenge types at the player, many of which are unlocked as you progress, with the overall goal of becoming a famous skater. Kicking things off, there are 20 'spots' hidden about the city. Get near one (or nowhere near one as sometimes seems to be the case) and you'll be able to bring up information about the spot, be it a set of stairs, or a lip and a rail. The basic task is to get a certain point score in one sequence on the spot, and you can approach it however you see fit. You don't even have to activate the challenge. You could be skating along, pop a flip off some stairs and into a bluntslide down the rail and - bam - you've beaten the challenge.     There are plenty of other challenges to be unlocked at defined locations too. Best Trick comps see you and three other guys competing to land the 'best' (defined here as 'highest scoring') trick within a time limit at a succession of spots. S.K.A.T.E. comps see you go up against one other skater in a game of one-upmanship - set or copy the trick, no repeats. You know the drill. Photo ops also pop up from time to time, where you'll have to hit a certain trick object and score enough points. Do that and you can choose the photo you want featured in the relevant skate mag. Pro Challenges see one of the professional skaters featured in the game offering you a technical challenge - get into a manual on the ledge then gap to the street, for instance - beat it and you'll get a sponsor offer.    The list goes on (X-Games anyone?), but my personal favourite would have to be the film challenges. These are available to attempt at any time and start out easily enough - get 1000 points within the time limit without stacking, but soon ramp up. The points requirements climb, as do secondary objectives you need to hit, like landing a seven metre drop and going from manual to flip trick to manual. You'll often have several film challenges at a time to choose from, and it bears repeating - you can attempt these at any time. Found a good spot and in a good rhythm? Choose a challenge and start recording. This completely opens the challenges up to your interpretation of the potential in the world and is simply glorious, glorious stuff. I've been saying for years that Tony Hawk should focus less on gimmicky collect 'em up gameplay and more on technical challenges, but it took skate to do it. While some of the challenges may be frustrating at times, and having NPC skaters bumbling about getting in your way can be annoying, the point is that this is a skating game for skaters.     We should also mention that by holding the left bumper button and hitting down on the D-pad, you can set a session marker. It's best to do it at the top of a great run or set of stairs, that way when you inevitably stack, or just have to do it again, you can just hold the left bumper button and hit up on the D-pad and you'll be taken back to that exact spot. Session markers are also great for efficiency when trying challenges like the 20 spots or photo challenges, although it must be said that EA's streaming tech doesn't handle it so well - get more than a short distance away from the marker and you'll have to sit through a loading screen to get back there. It's also worth mentioning that you lose your session marker by attempting a film challenge, and that you can't set session markers in no-skate zones (of which there are - annoyingly - many, complete with security guards chasing you down and fining you).   The session marker system is a good indication that Black Box knows how much time people will spend trying the same lines over and over. It's a good shortcut, but it would have been even better to have another layer, where you could set a number of markers on the world map in your favourite spots, to instantly return to. It's a big world, and sometimes you find yourself a long way from where you want to be. Negating this somewhat is the ability to select available challenges on the map and quickly jump to their location. You can also take the subway system throughout the city, but this is generally more hassle than it's worth.    This is a game for skaters, so as such there's a huge amount of info about your achievements at your fingertips. Go into the log book and you can see your magazine coverage, your personal bests (highest sequence score, most tricks in a sequence, longest manual, biggest drop, etc.) and your milestones (do every trick, come first in all comps, spend three hours in no-skate zones, grind an accumulated 1,000 metres, break 100 bones, etc.). Then there are screens of stats, like total grind distance, total flip tricks and so on. Elsewhere in the pause menu you can find a list of all the past events you've beaten, which allows you to quickly hop back to an event for another crack. And of course, there's a trick book, detailing how each trick in the game is performed.     So. The perfect game, right? Not quite, as there are a couple of glaring omissions. While the world feels and looks spot on when you're doing tricks and cruising, it all comes crashing down the second you well, come crashing down. Skate uses the most rudimentary of rag doll animations for stacking, and they're a massive disappointment. When you're skating you feel like a highly skilled athlete, dominating the streets, but as soon as you stack your skater instantly becomes inanimate. There's no effort to stay on your feet, there's no effort to get back up again, there's just falling on your face and lying there. That's simply not good enough and jolts you out of the world instantly.    Not only does it look really shoddy, but it's compounded by some of the utterly ridiculous situations in which you'll stack. Ride at a medium pace into a wall and your skater won't put his hands out to stop himself, he'll just hit it and collapse. Same if you hit a pedestrian or another skater - surely you should grab them or something? And yes, if you ride at a gutter, you will come off your board, but anyone who has been skating longer than ten minutes would be able to jump and land on their feet. Same goes for tricks too. If I'm trying to kickflip over a garbage bin and I don't quite make it, it looks ridiculous to clip the top and just fall, motionless, to the ground. Where, Black Box, where are the animations? I'll tell you where, and it saddens me - skate 2.      There's one other disappointment that we need to detail before we can wrap things up. The replay editor. It's okay, but we were really expecting more. Sure, unlike Proving Ground, you don't have to actually start recording, so if you do something cool, you can just go into the menu and edit it, but there just isn't that much to it. You can set start and end points for your clip, and play with the camera angles (there are only five), filters and speed throughout, but we'd like more flexibility - particularly the ability to cut and edit multiple clips together, and we'd like a less clunky interface. Oh well.Skate is an amazing game. It doesnt have the exhaustive trick-list of Tony Hawk, and its focus is resolutely on technical street skating (with a side order of bowls and ramps), which will definitely appeal to some more than others, but the controls, the animations, the physicality of your interaction with the world, the level design, the fact that the challenges are based around skating, not platforming, and a learning curve that just keeps going, leaves this as the newly crowned king of skateboarding videogames.Were disappointed, however, that Black Box didnt take the opportunity to incorporate proper stack animations and a more robust replay editor into skate. We suspect that these are the tough decisions that must be made during development, but it also smacks of leaving something for skate 2. Still, for anyone with a passion for skateboarding, this is the game to get. Tony who?", "date": "Sep 25, 2007"}
