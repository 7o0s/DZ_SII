Thankfully for my sanity and my happiness in this job, unexpected fun can surprise a guy from time to time. SpellForce isn't perfect, but it does have a lot of things going for it with a good blend of two genres that have been trying their best to form a blissful merger for some time now.   At first glance, SpellForce isn't the most creative piece of creation on the block. You see elves, dwarves, humans, orks, trolls, undead.... all of the same old stuff that was popularized by Tolkien in the Lord of the Rings that has been played out to death at this point. I know there is a familiarity there that gamers might look for, but I really think there must be some room for something new at some point. That being said, upon closer inspection SpellForce does have some nice tricks up their sleeves for the story. There's not going to be anything in the overall theme that's not familiar. You play as a hero. You save the universe from annihilation at the hands of a power hungry evil. You fight side by side with the different races of the land towards that end.   The good part is the history, where the hero came from, and how you as the hero will command your armies to victory. This particular world was once whole, full of different creatures and races. Thirteen powerful wizards of the land put their heads together and decided to end the fighting once and for all. In order to do this, they needed to create an army. Instead of using mortals for their purposes, they created powerful rune magic to create warriors bound to rune stones, forever trapped in service. Whenever these rune warriors die, they return to their rune, retaining skills of battle but becoming disoriented in personal memories. This inexhaustible army was brought to bear to tame the world. At the same time, the thirteen, called The Circle, were plotting to use the energy of the earth in a ritual to grant one of their number total power over all the forces of the world. But things went wrong and the immensity of the power unleashed fragmented the world and destroyed most of the group.   One of the last wizards named Rohen, set to making things right and began creating portals between the fragments of the world, floating in the ether. He is the one that wakes you from your slumber as a rune warrior. He grants you the ultimate boon of possession of your own rune, binding you to no one but yourself, and sets you on a task. Thus the story begins.   The story itself is told through interaction with the various NPCs found in the world, both in cities and without. They'll give clues to how the world is faring as well as quests that will lead you towards experience as well as eventual victory. The plot itself isn't bad if you can set aside some of the generic nature of the fight against the great evil and the world's inhabitants. Unfortunately it's mired down in some even more generic and cheesy writing and horrible voice work. Really. The voices are terrible. Most of this universe seems to be completely devoid of any type of emotion, even when talking about the death of loved ones. To be fair, not all of them are excruciating, but the majority of them aren't good and some are plain laughable.    But in order to enjoy this game, you'll just have to get over the ~acting~ and get into the gameplay. Phenomic has made a game that manages to flow very well between a more personal RPG setting and grander strategic elements. One way they've created this bridge is by allowing you to zoom in and take control of your main character. Once in the third-person mode, you can direct movement with the WASD set-up or the arrow keys (sorry no rebinding of keys). From this view, you can get a good look up close at the world you're moving through as well as get right up in the face of battle. You'll still have all of the commands available to you as you would get in the zoomed out RTS mode, but this little trick allows you to connect a little bit with your character.    There are a couple of problems with getting into the third-person view. First, if you're in the middle of a fight, which can be huge, then it's going to be insanely confusing and the frame rate will drop significantly, even on a beefy setup. If you've built yourself a melee based character, you're also going to have to get right up close to start attacking. If you right click an enemy from a distance, your character won't just run up and start hacking the target, you have to be right next to the damn thing. This can be a problem if you're trying to play in this view in a fight with multiple friendly units. Actually getting close enough is hard, but clicking on the right target is even more difficult.    I wish they could have added an action based attack so you could just slash your character's weapons without having to assign a target. Maybe this would have made things a bit more fun for a melee character. If you're an archer or a mage of some sort, you'll find things to be a bit easier. It's really simple to target the most powerful unit on the screen (just hit Tab) and then begin throwing spells or arrows with your memorized spells.   Even though that third-person is nice, I ended up spending most of my time in RTS view as there's never a time that third-person is actually required. The RTS portion of the game tries some new things, but basically sticks to the harvest, build, and conquer type of gameplay. You'll begin with some worker runestones, which can be found for each of the six races. Once the rune has been slotted on your runeboard, you can find the rune monument for the race of that particular worker rune. Once you find that monument and stand by it, you'll have the chance to activate it. All of your units will be summoned at these rune monuments. You'll have to begin creating workers that will in turn harvest goods and construct buildings that will allow the creation of combat units.   Of course, you'll also have your own character; complete with experience points, stats, skills, and equipment as well as the special rune heroes that you can collect through the game. These characters can also be outfitted with equipment and traded in and out of your line-up. Like racial runes, these hero runes will need their own monument from which you can call in whichever heroes you choose. The selection is diverse and adding the right mix can create a powerful group of fighters.    What's more interesting is the way that Phenomic decided to handle the introduction of new units and buildings and tie them into the role-playing and adventuring portions of the game. In order to construct buildings and units, you'll need plans for them. These can be found in chests or bought from vendors. Once you have them, you can slot them in any order in the plans menu system. This way, you can group all of the buildings and units where you want them for easy access. Once they've been slotted, they'll be available for use, assuming you have the correct amount of materials and requirements.    Each of the races will have different material needs, such as the dwarves wanting moonsilver while the elves and orks will need to harvest a plant called lenya. Each of the races has different types of units, complete with advantages and disadvantages. For example, the dark elves will gain a helper skeleton every time they kill at night while the regular elves will gain a defense bonus while fighting in a grove of trees, which combined with a forester building that allows the elves to create forests, creates what could be a powerful defensive combo. It seems to me that the elves have the definite advantage when it comes to materials, thanks to the foresters, but each of the races seem pretty well balanced from my experience.    Actually getting units to carry out some specific orders while in third-person, or the zoomed out RTS view, should be simple and often is. Along the top of the screen will be icons for each of your heroes (which I'll get into more in a second) and groups of units. When you target a unit, enemy or friendly, each of the icons will show options underneath. If it's an enemy, you can pick from your various heroes combat spells. If the target is friendly, you'll get an option of what sorts of helpful spells can be used. It's a fairly good system that works most of the time.   But in big battles, commanding your troops can be a bit more confusing.You won't find the normal smart, context sensitive, cursors that you've probably become accustomed to in other RTSs. Having an attack cursor pop up when you mouse over an enemy or when you're going to do an attack and move would be nice. The other problem is actually just clicking on the correct unit. Many of the units in the game are pretty small and look the same. While there are some sorting tools to select units of the same type, I guarantee you'll spend some time trying to figure out which unit is which. Actually clicking on the right unit to attack can be more difficult for similar reasons.   I also took some issues with the AI, even though for it's acceptable for the most part. First, the friendly AI. Pathfinding is not always great. Units tend to string out in long lines to get anywhere. Because of that, you would figure the added formations would help organize large groups and keep them together. Unfortunately these formations seem to have a much harder time finding their way through the maps. Hell, they have a hard time getting together into formation in the first place. Formations also can't be set in certain directions, making them nearly for quick regrouping in battle.    One of my biggest annoyances in controlling units is the inability to set behavior. You can tell a group to hold, but there are no options that I could find for defensive or aggressive stances. If you don't tell your healers to hold every time you move them, they'll go crazy and run straight into battle.    Units also have the annoying knack of doing a job they shouldn't be doing. Ranged units will run up to buildings and attack them (because they can't light them on fire with arrows for some strange reason, which I guess doesn't matter because buildings on fire won't burn down anyway) while perfectly good melee units with better melee attacks will be blocked out. Spell casting units will run out of mana and then run ahead into battle only to be destroyed as well.   Friendly AI can also be annoying in your own bases. Workers won't actually go to the rally point that you set, meaning you'll have to go find them at the monument, and units don't have the intelligence to move out of the way so that you can place a building. Most RTSs will allow a footprint to show everywhere with units just moving out of the way once a building has been placed. Not here.   On the other side of the coin, enemies will basically just attack in waves. Enemies will send out patrols however and if they see you, there's a good chance they'll take off back to their base and tell their friends. However, if you kill the patrol, your enemy will send out a bigger patrol once they don't return.   Graphically, SpellForce is fairly good. Lighting and environments can look very good at times, but units and characters do tend to be a bit bland. In other words, there's not a lot artistically different from other games we've seen. Even so, the game looks better than average, though players will less powerful machines will find their frame rates sliding from time to time in heavy battles.   Unfortunately, there are also a bunch of graphical errors in the game. For instance, you can see through the back of your character's head, right underneath the hair, and buildings will look like they're floating in the world if they're built on a down slope. Shadows also have some problems as characters will cast them on both sides of a mountain, which is pretty much impossible in real life.   Still, moving through these worlds is one of the best ideas in the game and is made easier through bindstones that can teleport your character in one or in between levels. This is especially necessary when you have to travel back to previous towns to complete quests. Sadly, all of the work you've done in each of the levels building up towns and armies is undone when you leave that level. I can understand the units disappearing as they were part of the rune magic that you take with you from place to place, but the buildings should have stayed put. Those things were built from materials. It's sad to wander back into a previous zone and see all of your stuff gone.   Those that are interested in SpellForce will also have the luxury of a multiplayer experience. The RPG elements are virtually eliminated however as ten pre-made avatars of different types will be available for players to use in each map. These heroes won't have inventories or gain levels. From there, players will be able to battle it out over 12 maps. These games can be a lot of fun as battles can be pretty focused thanks to the limited monuments and resources. Sadly, and a bit strangely, there's no skirmish mode. I can't say I understand that oversight as it's basically standard in most good RTSs.SpellForce isn't going to provide a whole lot that's original from a plot standpoint, but the background of the universe it takes place in serves as more than just a backdrop to overused ideas as it fits well into the gameplay.There haven't been a lot of games that manage to combine large scale strategy and role-playing together and be successful. Phenomic has made a damn good stab at it with this one though. Sure, it has some problems, but it also supplies a gameplay experience that can't be found anywhere else right now. I can imagine that if this title had the budget of a typical Blizzard game, the production values could have given this good game that extra something it needs to be great.", "date": "Feb 11, 2004"}
