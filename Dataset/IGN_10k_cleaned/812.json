{"name": "Worms: Armageddon", "name_review": "Worms Armageddon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/25/worms-armageddon-2", "text": "There are certain games in the N64 library that make you thank your lucky stars that your favorite Nintendo console has four controller ports. Games like GoldenEye, Super Smash Brothers and BattleTanx truly shined when they were surrounded by four gamers clinching and mashing their controllers to within an inch of their plastic little lives. Infogrames' Worms Armageddon may not cause your palms to sweat like some of those other multiplayer games but it makes up for its lack of raw intensity with some outstanding explosions, outrageous weapons and focus on strategy.   Gameplay If you remember the scene in Star Wars when the wookie and the droid were playing space-chess with little 3D critters, then you remember how cool it was to see pawns actually battle and defeat each other after a move was made. Worms isn't quite that cool, but it does capture the excitement of actually watching pieces destroy each other in a very traditional game of strategy.  In a nutshell, you have a limited time to move one of your handful of slimy worm soldiers --complete with its own accent and vocabulary-- attack and enemy and then move away. It's all done in a straight-up 2D world where everything that isn't in the background, where you can see wind blowing, is solid and an obstacle to deal with. Your worms are mobile but can only inch as far as their little half inch bodies can will allow them too. When you get one member of your four man army starting off in a little cubby hole, or on a little island by himself or balanced on top of a paintbrush you start to understand that this game is much tougher than its cute appearance suggests.  That variety of attacks are classic. Since worms aren't the most ferocious creatures, the variety of weapons available are wide and varied. You get conventional pistols, rifles, bazookas and grenades like any good violent game requires. But what about a skunk attack or the Holy Grenade? These are the attacks that will bring the most enjoyment to both the aggressor and the victim because it's just so cool to watch. We've already done a feature on weapons in Worms Armageddon so please feel free to check it out.   It's not enough that there's a way to attack worms with an exploding old lady, it's that all of the weapons require some practice and a little nerve to use effectively. When you attack with the skunk, which makes worms sick and forces them to literally cough up five points of health every few seconds, you have to make sure it won't come back to bite you in the end.  Even when you see someone attacking one of your worms, as you sit anxiously awaiting for your turn, there's a chance that someone's grand plan of attack, say a devastating frag grenade, there's always a chance that it will backfire and you're guy will be okay.  The solo game, including the training missions are plenty of fun and challenging to be sure, but playing Worms with buddies makes for one heck of a party game that rivals even Mario Party itself. It starts with the customization. You can make a team that can be saved to the cart and use it any time after that. You can set your team's language, accent, special weapon, tombstone and identifying flag.   The accents are of particular interest here considering Worms Armageddon's European heritage (the PC games were done by Team 17) it has an interesting take on American and British dialects.  All of the customization available in Worms means that you can really set up a different experience every single time you play the game. You can determine whether or not worms will take damage when they fall, how long they have to run after dropping off explosives and all kinds of other minute little details.   Because it's a turn-based strategy game, players will spend a lot of time simply watching Worms Armageddon do stuff rather than actually controlling the action. While a game that you spend more time watching than actually playing (Final Fantasy anyone?) could be a problem, you'll be so interested in what's happening during somebody else's turn because you never know what you'll see. Somebody may have a great bazooka attack that takes advantage of the wind and curls up and over an outcropping. A poor sap may drown half of his team --the water at the bottom of the screen is deadly in WA-- when the recoil from his shotgun pushes him and a nearby worm over the edge of a cliff.  The biggest difference between the single and multiple player games is that most human players won't play as efficiently as the always cheating computer. Other than this, they present nearly identical turn-based strategy experiences.  Sound Worms Armageddon gets its personality from the audio elements. Hearing the little pink guys threaten and interact with each other as you go through the game is definitely something that would be missed if it wasn't done well. The N64 version of the game has a surprising amount of sampling and dialogue although still nowhere near what you'll get from the PC or Dreamcast version.  The background music is a lot groovier than you'd expect from this type of game. But like the voice samples that go with it, the music is random and just out there enough to make you realize that weirdness is what it's all about.  You can play the game itself in German, French, English and Spanish where the text will change accordingly but you can have your little troopers actually speak German, French, Japanese and a few others as well. A few dialects like Soul Man and Sergent are really out there and will be an acquired taste if you're not offended immediately.  Graphics It's a simple 2D world, but somehow that's enough even in this age of 3D magic. Only having to worry about how far left or right and up or down that grenade or worm is positioned is probably a blessing because a 3D game like this could get awfully complicated very quickly.  There's not much animation to worry about beyond worms inching, leaves blowing and rockets, bombs and sheep launching so it all works well. Nothing ever moves that fast, even when you've ordered the overrated airstrike attack. One of the benefits of 2D is not having to worry about slowdown. Or maybe the fact that it's a turn-based strategy is what keeps everything nice and steady and crisp.   There's just something disheartening about a 2D game on a 3D machine like the N64. The Worms franchise just doesn't require any rounded features anywhere in the game. If that's the case, then we don't see any reason why the N64 version looks so much worse than Dreamcast or PC versions of Worms Armageddon.Worms Armageddon is one of those games that can be easy to overlook and easy to forget about until you actually pick it up and play it again. There are all kinds of yucks to be had when you're battling your buddies and lots of trash talking potential with this game. For better or worse this is what multiplayer gaming is about. Every time we happened to get a game going around the IGN offices we'd find ourselves begrudgingly putting down the controllers and getting back to work hours later. There aren't many better measurements of a game's value than that. The solo game is engaging and extremely tough and that includes the training missions. If you're looking for a game that will suck up hours of your videogame time then Armageddon is a fine choice. A 2D turn-based strategy may seem like a dinosaur of game concept, but if it's fun and looks and plays well, we say plug it in and play.", "date": "Mar 25, 2000"}
