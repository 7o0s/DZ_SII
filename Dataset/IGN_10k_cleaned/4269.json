I was hoping it would be the one game that would make me drop out of school, buy two months worth of food, and not leave my basement for anything. At first, it tugged at and held my attention. However, after playing it for nearly a month, I'm realizing that it isn't all I'd hoped for.   Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the game. I love the fact that I can now play a never-ending Final Fantasy that constantly has new content added to it, but there's nothing revolutionary about the game. Everything has already been done, and nothing new has been brought to the table. Granted, they do have both North American and Japanese players playing on the same server which is quite a feat, but I'm finding that this isn't exactly enhancing my gaming experience.   When I played my very first MMORPG, everything was new to me. The whole MMORPG thing was fresh and expectations were non-existent thanks to unexplored territory. All quests had yet to be solved, mysteries could take hours to unravel, and best of all, there was a chance you could be the first to figure them out. That fame is one thing many gamers strive for. With Final Fantasy XI, that hope has been all but eliminated.   As I mentioned in the First Impressions article, there were no North American servers at launch, so we were forced to play with the Japanese. I have nothing against the Japanese as my experience with them has been great. They've been very kind by helping me out with info and money, invited me to groups, and basically anything else I needed. But that's also the problem. Before any North American player set foot on the servers, there were already Japanese players that were level 70 (The maximum level possible) that knew the game inside out. Every single quest and mission has been solved, and nothing new was left for new players to find.      It's not unusual to find new players asking higher level people for money, asking for help to guide them through quests which seems to eliminate the feeling of accomplishment these gameplay elements are supposed to bring. I prefer to explore and figure things out on my own rather than asking people or looking them up on a site. Sure, you can tell me to not ask people or look at these guides, but when grouping to complete a quest or a mission, chances are good that someone in the group has already looked up a walkthrough. Social games like these rely on everyone to have the same sensibilities as you in order for you to have fun.   While on the topic of quests, I've always been one that loves to quest and find cool and unique items. With over 100 quests completed, it's safe to say this game is packed with content. There are still hundreds of quests, but I'm finding myself less inclined to ferret them out. Many of the quests are fairly simple item fetch and retrieve quests. There are of course some interesting quests that require you to not only find special items, but also visit different places in the world, in one case, places with different weather conditions. There are 8 elements in the world of Vana'Diel, each of which can be a weather effect when in a play area. Certain weather effects only occur in certain zones, so you'll need to explore the world and wait for the weather effects to occur.   I also really wish quests to find unique weapons and armor pieces were offered to add that collector's feel to the game. Of course there are items in game that everyone wants, but there's nothing that has a cool graphical effect like flames coming out of a sword, or glowing effects on armor. With the great spell animations found in game, you'd expect them to be able to easily implement items with animation effects. The one thing I saw that had any sort of special effect was a Game Master wearing their armor, with a blur effect surrounding them. Having rewards like that waiting at the end of the road would have made questing a whole lot more exciting for me.   Missions on the other hand are one of the cooler aspects of FFXI. They're directly tied to the storyline that you can take part in for your kingdom. Each kingdom has their own storyline, though there are times when missions allow all three kingdoms to work together to complete a greater goal. Each player also has their own personal storyline and can go at any pace they want. The problem is, after the first four or five missions, you're forced to group with others in order to have any sort of chance of completing them.    Mission six for example required me to travel to the kingdoms other than my own and perform tasks for them, one of which was to slay a dragon. This was the first time my heart actually started pounding and I had a fear of dying. When you enter the boss chamber to complete mission 6 fast paced music, similar to those of previous Final Fantasy games, strikes up giving a real sense of urgency and danger. A movie sequence also played through revealing another piece of the story. My party and I went in, slashing and hacking away at the dragon, giving it all we had. Five minutes later, the dragon fell, though my heart continued to race. This was actually the turning point for me where I really started to enjoy the game.     I found that the lower levels were quite boring, but after reaching level 18 things take a turn for the better. Once you hit 18, you can complete a quest that allows you to take on a 2nd job at the same time as your main one which is called your 'Subjob'. This essentially allows you to have the skills and abilities of two different jobs at the same time. Of course there are some limitations to prevent you from becoming too powerful, such as experience is only gained with your main job, and your subjob can only be a maximum of half your main job.   The cool thing about the job system is that you can change them at any time you're in town. You start off with six jobs, and once you reach level 30 you can complete quests to unlock up to nine new jobs for a total of 15. If you start off as a Warrior and get to level 20 only to find that you're bored of being a fighter, you can go back to town and change your main job to White Mage or some such thing. If you ever get tired of the White Mage, you can always change back to the Warrior and you will still be level 20 with all your previous stats. You will never permanently lose any levels by changing jobs.    But there is one way you can lose levels which is a real pain... Upon death, you lose a certain percentage of your overall experience earned towards the next level. This is one thing I firmly believe should never happen in any of these games. It causes a lot of frustration thanks to the many lost hours of their time spent leveling. If you just recently leveled up and die, chances are you're going to lose more XP than you have. You'd think you'd just go to 0 and stay the same level, but that's not the case. You get bumped down a level and any items you may have equipped or new skills and abilities you may have learned are lost. So if you're having a bad night and die multiple times, you could potentially lose a few levels in a few hours rather than gain them. You may not think it's that bad, but when you're on a death streak, opinions will change very quickly.      The next major milestone after level 18 is 20, where you can then complete a quest to get a chocobo license, granting you the ability to ride a chocobo for a fee. Chocobos can be found in every major city as well as at random places around the world, the cost depending on some unknown factor I've yet to determine. Once you ride a chocobo, you'll wonder how you ever had the patience to walk anywhere. It wasn't until I got the chocobo that I realized how tedious it was to run from one kingdom to the next. Not only is running slow, you also have to worry about monsters attacking you during the run which can be deadly at the lower levels. Imagine a little three foot midget running across the desert, screaming at the top of his lungs with a 25 monster long train behind him. With just a few hits from the monsters I'd be dead Taru-Taru meat. For those wondering, yes I did survive, though I lost a little dignity.    I feel obligated to mention some concerns I've heard other people shout about in-game and on various forums. The first of these is the issue of controls and the UI in general which many people have expressed their displeasure with. Consequently many players feel the only way to play the game is with a Gamepad. People have suggested using an adapter to use your PS2 controller with the PC, or simply buying one of Logitechs gamepads. I, however, have found the keyboard mapping to be one of the best I've ever played with in an MMO. Everything is accessible with the touch of a button. That not only includes menus, but skills as well. You can create up to 100 macros, which allows you to bind shortcut keys to perform emotes, skills, abilities, or simply shout something out. You can literally play this game without ever having to touch the mouse, which is a dream to any gamer such as myself. For those who don't like the keyboard layout, the ability to change the keyboard mapping was added, which should keep gamers happy if they'd rather change things for their own style.   Next issue: the camera. As a beginner, it's extremely awkward and unpredictable. It isn't fixed behind your character like it is in most MMOGs. In fact, it has a bit of a delayed reaction to your movement, so if you make any sudden turns, the camera will not adjust until you've moved in the new direction a few steps. It's almost as if you're dragging the camera around with a string, and if you turn around, you have some slack so the camera won't follow until it tenses up. This forces you to have to constantly adjust your camera using the arrow keys, which wasn't a huge problem for me but seems to be for some others. All my friends get nauseous when watching me play games because I'm constantly rotating cameras just for the sake of doing something, but it seems not everyone is the same way.    On a somewhat related note, the graphics of the game at first glance are shocking. When you first launch the game, it defaults to 640x480, the res that the PS2 version runs on, however thankfully there's an option to increase this resolution to whatever you want. The difference in the quality of graphics from 640x480 to 1280x1024 is incredible. At lower resolutions the graphics look dated and unappealing. But once the res is boosted, FFXI can compete with any MMORPG on the market. The skill and spell effect animations are the best I've seen in an online game and definitely add some excitement to combat.    Sounds and music are as expected, for the most part it's great and I have no problems. As I mentioned previously, the boss music during the end of missions is a great change of pace and really adds to the battles, however I wish this happened more often. Having a variety of battle music would have improved the experience and I might have left the music on. As with most games, after hearing the same music repeatedly for over a month, it can get rather dull, prompting a little pressure on the mute button. This is to be expected with all games and there's no real way around it.   One last concern I must raise is that of patching. Like other MMOGs, every little while they patch the game with bug fixes and every so often new content and other things. The one problem is that the time of day at which they patch is prime time for many gamers. I do however understand the dilemma they face since it's nearly impossible to find a time that is suitable for players in both Japan and North America that won't interrupt someone's game play, but it still sucks. On a more positive note, some of the things they have lined up for the next six months sound very promising. In the next couple months the level cap is being raised from level 70 to 75, new quests are being introduced, and a whole slew of updates are being implemented. Sometime next year they plan to introduce PvP in multiple patches, which is a huge change to the game mechanics. One can only hope it's implemented properly without disrupting the game play of those who prefer to avoid this aspect of MMOGs.    All in all I've enjoyed the game so far, however now that I've broken the level 30 barrier, I'm finding myself with less reason to login everyday. I'm not getting that sense of urgency I had for the first few weeks to login and keep leveling. There are no major goals to strive for such as getting your subjob, the chocobo license, or being able to unlock the advanced jobs. At this point it's back to the leveling treadmill with nothing but quests and missions to look forward to. With that said, I do plan on continuing to play seeing as how it's better than many MMORPGs on the market right now. It recently broke the 400,000 subscriber mark, taking the title of 2nd place of most subscribers. (EverQuest still ranking at #1) There are little to no apparent bugs, the client is extremely stable, and there's so much content that it will be at least another 6 months before I've had a chance to explore it all. By that time, there is bound to be even more things added to the game through patches which will keep things fresh. One thing to keep in mind is that this game is not for the solo player. If you're one that prefers to hunt alone (then why play an MMORPG?), you're going to find yourself having a hard time after the first 15 levels. Most of the higher level content will require a group, so making new friends to hunt with regularly is something I highly suggest. As with most other MMOGs, this game does require a monthly fee of $12.95. Is it worth it? I think so. Is this just another MMORPG with the name Final Fantasy slapped on it to make money? No, because it does feel like a Final Fantasy world with all the familiar skills, jobs, and NPCs.  A game can't be labeled as Final Fantasy without Cid making an appearance, and sure enough, he does. Things are only going to get better as they add new content, so you can expect to see this game living a long and healthy life.", "date": "Dec 2, 2003"}
