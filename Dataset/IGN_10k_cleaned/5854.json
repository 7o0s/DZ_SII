{"name": "TrackMania Sunrise", "name_review": "TrackMania Sunrise", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/28/trackmania-sunrise", "text": "When I reviewed the original TrackMania, I had a pretty long list of things about it that didn't sit right with me--and I'll just say right off that, to their credit, Nadeo really seemed to go back to the drawing board for Sunrise and revamp the whole shindig from head to toe. It looks better, it plays better, and it even sounds better this time around. For those of you knew to the series, it's based around designing your own tracks, racing on some potentially crazy pre-made tracks, sharing tracks with others, and beating all kinds of time trials. There's a lot of variety, the tracks can be very larger-than-life, and it's easy to sit down and play for short periods of time.   One of my major complaints about the previous installment was that the track creation tools didn't make much use of the mouse at all. With a 3D environment, it can be awkward to navigate the scene with only keyboard commands. Sunrise fully integrates the mouse now, and it's much smoother and faster. With the brand-new camera control, you can zoom in and out, pan around, and get a much better sense of what you're building and how it fits together. Since track creation is such a touted feature, it's great to have work so nicely now. Of course, creating something that looks cool doesn't always mean it's going to make for a good track, but that's not really Nadeo's fault.   Another previous reservation I had was that it felt too much like toy cars on toy tracks. The cars felt too light and the tracks felt small and wickedly curved. Well, they've given a lot more weight to the vehicles and the roads feel much wider. You'll still get some crazy jumps, gaps, leaps and hairpin turns, but it's a definite improvement in the feel department. You'll still find yourself running into obstacles and overshooting targets simply because you're driving too fast, which leads to some trial-and-error gameplay, but it's not as prevalent as before. At any rate, it's more fun to race, and Sunrise features some truly jaw-dropping track sections.   The graphics also got an overhaul, to the point where things can actually start to get a little chunky if I max everything out. Motion blur seems to be the culprit here, but you can disable this feature. The textures look sharper, the cars shinier, and the view distance longer. There's a pleasing amount of graphical options to tweak to your rig's performance capability. You can also customize your vehicle to a pleasing degree, although there's still only three vehicles to choose from. There's also still no collision detection, unfortunately, or damage modeling (cosmetic or otherwise), and high-speed turns are still very grippy, but it's a sight better than the plastic feel of the original. I'd really like to see some collision detection, but that would probably mean reworking the tracks again, as there are many sections where you just have to have your car just so in order to clear the next hurdle it throws at you.     In fact, it's very difficult to complete the track in a way other than the designers seem to intend, and there isn't much margin for flexibility. Like the original, it's very easy to go flying off the track, and sometimes impossible to get back on. You can restart from the last check point, of course--but almost all the races are timed, and you must win in order to unlock other tracks. Sunrise is, unfortunately, very big on unlocking tracks, and you must race near-perfectly to get that vaunted gold medal. You'll have to get 1st place on a lot of genuinely challenging and sometimes aggravating tracks, and that doesn't actually guarantee the gold. The gold is gained by beating a certain time, instead of simply getting to the finish line first.   So you can still beat everyone and not get the medal you need to unlock something. Eventually, you'll need to have a mountain of decorations, including winning several race series and well as individual races. The series can be around a dozen races, and you'll need to get gold in each and every race to get gold for the whole shebang. Get silver in one of those races, and you'll get a silver for the series. The overwhelming majority of the game's tracks are locked, which can force you to repeatedly brute-force your way through something you're not interested in, until you find just the right way to take this corner and that for the gold. Since you can't actually race against the other cars, your only choice is to beat the clock. And with no track mini-map, no emergency brake, and inconsistent results for balls-to-the-wall racing (sometimes it's the only way to get a jump just right, other times it means flying right over your target), you have your work cut out for you.   On the bright side, I found the puzzle challenges to be pretty neat, in general. There's rarely an obvious way to get from start to finish, and here the game gives you that flexibility and room for creativity that I think it lacks elsewhere. Unfortunately, the puzzle challenges are also beholden to the track unlocking scheme, but at least you have the opportunity to play around a little and try new things.TrackMania Sunrise is an improvement in virtually every way, but the extreme stunt nature of the tracks, combined with the heavy emphasis on unlocking content (which itself rests upon racing very well), can mean repeating the same track several times until you get it just right. If the time requirements were a little lower and the unlock requirements a little more forgiving, the fun factor would probably be a lot more consistent. Instead, finally getting to the next race usually gives you a feeling of weary relief, rather than the ~Hell yeah!~ satisfaction of clearing a difficult hurdle. I can't presume to say that the line between fun and frustration is easy to steer clear of, but I crossed it more times than I'd like. Those who primarily want to create and share their own content will probably get a kick out of Sunrise. Right now, there's about 250 Sunrise tracks on the official site, and they're sortable by number of downloads, user rating, and so forth. And the files are also quite small, in the 5-20 kilobyte range, making it easy to enjoy this aspect even with a pokey ole' 56k modem. So kudos to Nadeo and gang for offering all the user-created content--it's just too bad that it takes a lot of time effort to get to all the stuff in the retail package, with no clear sign that the time investment will be worth it.", "date": "Jun 28, 2005"}
