{"name": "80 Days", "name_review": "80 Days", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/01/13/80-days", "text": "Jules Verne has been inspiring science fiction writers for over a hundred years now so it's no surprise that his novels would eventually make the transition to the world of video games. Though it references Verne's novel, Frogware's 80 Days uses the original story the jumping off point. The game places players in the role of a young man who's decided to help his engineer uncle retrieve proof of four of his inventions scattered around the world. The uncle needs the proof to win a bet; the young man needs the time away to avoid having to marry against his will. Along the way, the young man will also strangely be recruited help to spread Scottish fashions around the world.   Happily for Verne fans, the game makes frequent reference to Fogg's original journey and even includes characters and locations from the original novel. You'll run into a new Fix, see foreign chapters of The Reform Club and visit Bombay, Yokohama and San Francisco. The cities are just ginormous and loaded with personality. Pedestrians, rat weiner carts, billboards, pets and a host of other details are scattered throughout each city, giving you a real sense of life. The architectural design of each city is fairly distinct as well, lending an unique atmosphere to every level. I quite like that the game doesn't force you to explore every sidestreet and alley in these cities. It really gives the game an open sort of feeling.   Since the cities are so large, you'll want to make use of a wide variety of local vehicles. Hiring a car (or magic carpet or elephant or monocycle) is as simple as walking up to them and paying a small rental fee. From there you can use the vehicles to zip from puzzle to puzzle. While the vehicles make things nice and convenient, the controls are a little swimmy leading to lots of collisions. Unfortunately, any object in the environment will stop your vehicle. Sure, it makes sense that you can't drive your car through a wall but it's stupid that an elephant can't walk over a parrot.  You'll also have three forms of transportation to take you from one city to the next. Each of these transportation sections allows for quite a bit of adventuring as well. You'll have to puzzle out some bizarre monster attacks on a swanky train, pilot through a dangerous bird formation in a large zeppelin, and stop a terrible leak on board a luxurious cruise ship. There's nearly as much activity here as there is in the cities but the action is much more focused. You'll still find yourself constantly running back and forth but you won't feel as lost as you do in the cities.  The puzzles are hit or miss here. For one thing, most of them simply involve finding certain buildings or people in the cities. Since the people or buildings in question are shown on your minimap, finding them is less of a challenge and more of a time sink. While time definitely factors into the game, gameplay designed purely to consume time is hardly compelling.  Things are a bit better when it comes to the logic puzzles. Many of them aren't too much a stretch -- you'll just need to recognize a sequence or pattern -- but a few of them require real problem solving skills. I won't spoil any of the specific solutions here but you'll be hard-pressed to figure out how some of them work. Luckily, any part of a puzzle that can be manipulated will light up with a green outline when you get close to it.  In addition to the exploration sequences and puzzles, you'll have the opportunity to engage in a few other activities. A couple of minigames lend a different flavor to the game but they're so unbelievably easy that they hardly constitute a real challenge. The game's two stealth sequences are much more challenging. Happily, you can bribe your way out of one of them. The other took much trial and error before I found a way around it.  You'll also find yourself challenged by the time and money limitations imposed on you, particularly on the higher difficulty levels. On all but the lowest difficulty level each passing minute is counted against you in your race around the world. Dally too long and you'll fall behind schedule. A handy icon in the upper right of the screen lets you know if you're ahead of or behind schedule. Unfortunately, the game is incredibly linear, which sort of kills the idea of being able to lose or make up time based on your choices.   Another big challenge is managing your fatigue level. Running depletes your energy stores. These can be refilled by either checking into a hotel for the night or buying some food from a vendor on the street. The food is the cheaper, quicker option, but it just doesn't do as much for you as sleeping in a bed. If you manage to run out of fatigue in the middle of the game, you'll pass out. Eventually you'll wake up with a bit more energy to burn. The game explains that a passerby took you to the hotel to rest up and then brought you back to your original location before you even woke up. Why they just don't explain that you fell asleep in the street is beyond me.  80 Days makes use of a powerful but temperamental engine. It renders a wide range of locations but it's a real drain on your hardware. Even on a new(ish) Alienware system there was plenty of stuttering and chopping. It's a small price to pay for the rich locations and the cool weather and time of day effects, but I would hardly recommend playing the game with the box's listed minimum of a 64MB video card. Frequent disc access caused the game to stop completely, particularly in Bombay's Bollywood and numerous locations in San Francisco.  The graphics look very good though. The characters are wonderfully detailed and the colors and textures of each city add a lot of depth to the world. The small touches are also nice. I particularly like the posters plastered all throughout the city and the interesting reading material available when you're moving from city to city.  Audio is beset with a few problems. Voice acting is pretty terrible all the way through the game and the music numbers are a little labored (not to mention kind of a ripoff). 80 Days does away with the static backgrounds and pixel hunting that characterized old school adventure games and replaces them with an interactive 3D environment. Unfortunately, the puzzles are focused a little too much on running errands and less on using your brain. You'll find a lot of personality (and not a little humor) as you make your way through the game but the only thing that's really being challenged here is you patience.", "date": "Jan 13, 2006"}
