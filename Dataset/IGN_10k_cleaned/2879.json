The Game Boy Advance version doesn't follow that formula...in fact, it takes the game idea in a completely different direction. The design constructed for the GBA isn't nearly as elaborate or over-the-top, and has a few gameplay quirks to contend with throughout the challenge...but it's not too bad a romp. Features Nine pros 12 skate parks Licensed music: Hoobastank, Black Sheep, The Vandals, and more Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  Full Fat's the development team that worked on Aggressive Inline, the studio that also worked on Acclaim's previous extreme GBA title: Dave Mirra 2. The team's work on Mirra 2 netted a very competent 2D/3D engine, and Full Fat worked this engine for a new game design that utilized Acclaim's Aggressive Inline branding. The GBA game throws out pretty much all of the established gameplay of the console title, so those players going into this game with the mentality of ~console experience on a handheld~ are going to get a rude awakening. Go in with an open mind and you'll be a lot happier with the title.  Players grab control of one of nine different skaters and try to get him through the challenges in 13 different locations, each dominated by some skate rat you don't want to tangle with. Each location has three or more challenges, each with its own skate area...in each area, your challenge is to complete one, two, three, or all of the tasks in the checklist, along with beating the top score in the area within the set amount of time. These tasks include collecting items, smashing items, jumping through hoops, or performing ~slaloms~ without knocking over cones. While it's not a cakewalk to complete these tasks and you'll find yourself plowing through a few continues to get through the first few challenges, the developers made it a bit easier by keeping accomplished tasks marked off the lis. So, if you need to clear out two items off the list, and you've already done one even when the time runs out, the task previously completed will stay off the list if you use one of your ~lives.~ But if you run out of lives and need to ~continue,~ the list resets. Run out of continues, and the game's over. It's a very challenging game with these limitations in place, but there's no cartridge save to keep unlocked parks open, or high scores in memory. Boo!  Aggressive Inline's design focuses on grinding, more so than other extreme sports games. Instead of having a ~special~ meter, the developers worked a unique ~grind~ meter in its place...this bar is filled by pulling off basic air tricks, and it doesn't take much to max it out. As long as you've got color in that bar, you can pull off grind moves without bailing. No grind meter, no grinding. The one console element that the design team did incorporate in the GBA version: you can switch grinds on the fly. It's actually encouraged, since your trick combo will increase with every switch during a grind. With this grind focus, there are a lot of connecting rails to ride and discover. Unfortunately, the vert focus isn't nearly as strong...there are certainly quarter and half-pipes throughout the game, but the balance between grinds and vert tricks just isn't there. You can't link vert tricks together with manuals...which just seems wrong in this genre now that it's been established elsewhere, even in the console versions of this game.  While it's only a minor issue, collision detection seems to be the game's biggest problem. The developers make it easy to latch onto the nearest rail to grind, but in some instances you might find a little blip in the collision that will end a grind link or worse, cause a misdirected jump or an accidental bail. It doesn't happen too frequently, but it does happen...and it's obvious that the game's controls aren't quite as tight or forgiving as the team's Dave Mirra 2. And the mall challenge near the first half of the game is just downright nasty...a minute to grab three tokens, one of which is placed atop a nearly-inaccessible fencing. Talk about unnecessary frustration.  Probably one of the large disappointments we had with Full Fat's Dave Mirra 2/i > design released last year was its lack of a two-player link cable challenge. With Aggressive Inline, the team was able to add the two-player link functionality to the engine, with moderate results. Players can skate around the same park in Trick, Points, and Combo challenges, but that's as far as this feature goes. The ~stipple~ effect that tells if a person is behind or in front of an object is turned off for the opposing player...the result is a strange visual problem that makes it difficult to see where the other person's standing. But that doesn't really matter, since collisions are also turned off...players cannot run into each other while zooming around, almost defeating the purpose of this multiplayer challenge. Almost.  The polygonal models look a bit retarded up close, especially with the ones that have this three-poly hump on their back (presumably that's supposed to be a backpack), but since these close-ups only occur in the character selection screen, it's not terribly distracting. The game does show that a directional reference is really necessary in this perspective, though...that skateboard in Tony Hawk and the bike in Dave Mirra help guide in pointing the player in the right direction...and all these guys have are wheels on their feet. It makes it difficult to land a vert trick, or hop on a rail properly...practice makes perfect, though, and you can always head into any unlocked area for a free run.  But man, the team knows how to impress in the audio department. Aggressive Inline has a surprisingly good amount of digitized audio, actual recordings from the console version of the game. The soundtrack has been compressed and edited with loops to fit on the limited cartridge format, but it does sound great...either these guys had a ton of cartridge space left over, or they worked a mean compression routine on the GBA. Either way, now that they've done the deed it's up to other Extreme Sports GBA developers to follow the lead. I'm a huge fan of the console versions of Aggressive Inline, so I will say that I was a bit disappointed to see Full Fat not attempt to reproduce the console experience on the handheld...sure, it wouldn't be nearly the same thing on the GBA, but I'm sure that the game could have retained many of the design ideas on the portable system.That said, I do like the direction that the team went with this version, even though the gameplay and controls aren't quite as tight as Tony Hawk or Dave Mirra. The challenges and skateparks have enough variety to keep players going through the ranks...but only if they can get through that obnoxious mall challenge early in the game.
