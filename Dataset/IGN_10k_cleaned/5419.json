But the game maker is looking to scratch an itchy trigger finger with their latest release, a World War I-themed shooter named Bomber Pilot. Older gamers (like us) will instantly recognize influences from SEGA's arcade blaster Zaxxon and the Commodore 64 classic Blue Max. If you haven't played either of those, trust us, those are very good games to be reminded of.   The bomber pilot in question was once the leader of a fine squadron of airmen, but after a disastrous run over enemy lines, only he remained. Now it's time for revenge. Flying solo, you must enforce a strict scorched earth policy on your foe's real estate. Nothing is to remain standing -- not infantry posts, gun nests, ships, nor tanks. And there is no shortage of targets, so bust out those bomb sights and hit the heavens to unleash merciless hell.   Much like Zaxxon, Bomber Pilot requires you to always be aware of your altitude. As you scream over enemy territory, you must constantly adjust altitude so as not to crash into hills or tall bridges. You plane is fairly lightweight and cannot take direct contact for very long before you crash into the ground in a streaking ball of fire and metal. (It's actually kind of cool to watch, though, as your plane cuts a deep wound in the earth.)   You could always remain lofty and play it safe, but your score will seriously suffer. The lower you are to the ground -- the closer to your targets -- the shorter the distance you bombs have to fall. It's much easier to be accurate and prolific when you are riding close to the surface.   HandyGames uses an isometric view to give you a nice look at the battlefield, allowing plenty of advance notice of upcoming targets. The ground scrolls by cleanly, and we were really impressed with the variety of surface features and destructible objects. The view also makes it really simple to judge your altitude via quick comparisons to the ground as well as a constant shadow always beneath your plane. The closer you are to the shadow, the closer you are to the ground.Bomber Pilot really works. It's a frantic shooter that succeeds not just because of smart game play mechanics and excellent control, but because HandyGames didn't try to do too much with it. You bomb things on the ground. There is no dogfighting to distract from your singular goal, and when the landscape starts getting more textured than the back the 'roider that sometimes shows up at my gym, you really need to concentrate on mastering altitude awareness.
