Whether they're discussing Gran Turismo or Sega GT, the sheer amount of knowledge, expectation, and forgiveness displayed by the dedicated subset of players is matched only by the rabid RPG crowd. It's a group that, like the Illuminati, are believed not to exist. A collection of people that know no restraint when tackling the latest entry in their beloved genre, and the type of fan that will hound you until the end of time until you get the information on their game 100% correct.   Which made the latest task in our review duties all the more daunting, as we were about to tackle just that kind of videogame. A motorcycle simulation that saw moderate success abroad and has been gaining some respectable buzz in our mailboxes leading up to its eventual release, Riding Spirits has been heralded as the ultimate in its class. A motorcycle recreation so accurate that none before it have ever reached its level. And though on many levels it has achieved just what it set out to do, Spirits ultimately lacks what is the most important category of all: fun.   Features  Much in the way it flatters Gran Turismo in ambition, it does so also in design. Offering up well over 100 plus cycles and a number of different riding options, Riding Spirits is certainly comparable to the best-selling juggernaut that is A-Spec. Whether you want a quick race, career, or some deviation thereof, the sky is the limit. Then again, it could compare with Turismo so well because of the fact that it seems to copy the code straight over. Baring an eerie resemblance in every respect to Dave Z's favorite game, this is the most obvious, bare-bones rip-off of another game we've ever seen.   Just like the aforementioned super racer, building your perfect racing machine and unlocking the extra bikes can be handled through consistent racing and earning money to buy better equipment and stylish clothing. Equipment and upgrades make a significant difference in the performance of your cycle more so than we've seen before, so there is an extra incentive to getting the better stuff early. It's pretty straightforward really, and nowhere near as complicated or branching as some of the bigger name simulations out there which should please the common gamer.   If a quick pass through the motions is more your style, there's the standard time attack and quick race options too and you can always go head to head with either the computer or a buddy in battle mode. Overall it's a solid little set of goodies, and a step in the proper direction. It's still a straight copy of Gran Turismo though, no doubt about it.   Gameplay  The true problem with doing a realistic motorcycle game is that it turns out to be more of a chore than entertainment. It doesn't matter how many physics tweaks you make, enhancement options you offer, or how fabulous it looks from far away, if the challenges are too great, it's going to be hard to hold on to your customer. That's the exact trap that Riding Spirits falls into.   To its credit, the game has plenty of the qualities I mentioned above. Be it a realistic physics engine, proper balancing ratios, and a host of other such categories that determine the separation between reality and fiction. But as hard as the developer Spike has tried, the feeling of ~fun~ is elusively kept in the shadows.   One of the most obvious reasons is because of Riding Spirits sense of speed. Although the interface may tell you that you're moving along at 100 miles an hour, the screen gives off the impression of only 30. Because of this difference between sight and statistics, it becomes incredibly difficult to judge when to turn, when to lean, and when to hit the brakes. Taking a sharp corner at 40 mph is a hell of a lot easier than doing so at 100, but since the game doesn't separate the look of the two by much, you'll be falling off of your bike more times than you count and as a result, losing miserably.   Additionally, it feels as though there's little to do other shift with the shoulder buttons and hit the gas and the break. Obstacles are non-existent and the racing field is for the most part empty. It all turns into a lonely jaunt down a stretch of road that can turn into an even longer losing campaign the more you fall down. In the first few hours of play, that's how things shape up -- with a stretch of road before you and a severe case of basiphobia.   In Gran Turismo the lonely tracks were supplemented with well designed turns, a host of adjustments to make to your vehicle, and feeling of real involvement that Riding Spirits just can't provide. Unless you spend hours upon hours practicing your techniques, you're prowess for completing even a simple lap somewhere in the top three could be damn near impossible. While I realize the premise of the game focuses on the realism behind driving a two-wheeled speed machine, that doesn't necessarily mean that even the most accurate of recreations will be fun.   And lets be honest, the whole point of riding a motorcycle is to feel the wind in your face, enjoy the tremendous speed that you're accomplishing, and to feel the power between your legs. Yes folks, as Dave Smith would say ~it's a full on phallic locomotor's symbol~. Riding Spirits just doesn't accomplish that.   Graphics  Riding Spirits tries its hardest to match the look established by Gran Turismo 3 and does a respectable job of doing so. Lens flare, shadowing techniques, and other familiar graphical tricks are spread throughout each of the well-represented courses and at first glance give the impression that you're playing a two-wheeled expansion of A-Spec. Upon further inspection however, you'll start to notice the differences that separate the good from the great.   The biggest complaint is the lack of detail on the textures themselves. Somewhat flat and overflowing with gray tones, it won't take long before your eyes start longing for something else. And while the city tracks break up the monotony on a positive note, there aren't enough of them to save you from the endless sea of half-black and not so white. When you're lucky enough to race through the city courses though, they are definitely a thing of beauty, with realistic foliage and convincing cobblestone zoom ways.   On the draw-in front, there's almost never a distant polygon mess happening in the background (which bodes well for visual fiends), and there appears to be as many as six bikes on the screen at any one time before there's any noticeable slowdown. The key strike in Riding Sprits ocular resume though, has to be the lack of rider animation. While he may move his knee in one or two spots when taking the turns, there isn't much else to speak of. Why not go a little over the norm and include a variety of head gestures, waving arms, and other such human reactions? It's really too bad.   In two moves I really like however, RS not only offers up true 16:9 widescreen television support but also the option to choose what kind of two player mode you want. This allows Twisted Metal fans to go at it, horizontally split style, while old-school fans like myself can move it into vertical mode and go two-player    Sound  Unfortunately there isn't much to speak of in this department. Other than a few jazzy renditions played during replays and menu screens, the only other audio the game has to offer comes in two categories: screeches and engine revving. Sadly, they aren't pulled off very convincingly and become just as tedious as the racing engine itself. Almost lawn mower like in execution, the constant hum of the motorcycle started to drive the IGN crew bats after only a few races.   There should have been more variety in the motor noise, a more realistic sense of space (which Spike touches on briefly with tunnel echo), and maybe even voices or grunts from the riders. Left with only buzzing and the occasional piano riff, your ears will grow tired before their time.Don't misunderstand; Riding Spirits isn't necessarily a bad game. With all of its choices and features and similarities to other racing simulations on the market, there are a score of fans that will snatch this one up without a second thought.When you break it down to its essence however, Spike's motorcycle racing game is little more than a clone of a fantastic driving game that we've been playing for almost two years now. And while Riding Spirits captures the same ideals and borrows some of the same mechanics that make the Gran Turismo series so great, a copy will always be a copy, and never quite match the quality of an original.", "date": "Sep 6, 2002"}
