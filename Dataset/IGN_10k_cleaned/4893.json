A brand name like that comes with some serious weight, and Macrospace has managed to nab one of the latter name's most fondly remembered properties, Actraiser for the Super Nintendo.   Features:   Classic SNES game  Boss battles  Full score   Actraiser remains an absolutely beloved title amongst SNES fans for its exquisite score and a brilliant mix of action and strategy. Unfortunately, this mobile version of Actraiser complete eschews the world map half of game play, which will likely make many gamers very, very sad. Not only because that means there is none of that genius town development stuff, but the (then) ooh-aah Mode 7 graphics and the overworld score is MIA.   What remains instead is just the side-scrolling hack n' slash game play that divided each over world chapter. Those segments were good, but not as involving as the cityscape sequences -- and for that, Actraiser suffers. In fact, without the overworld sequences, the game's classic aura fades. We've played too many side-scrollers since Actraiser that this just seems to blend into the pack.   At least the action is presented well. The control is tight and simple, just like the original. No massive move library here -- just run, jump, duck, and swipe. This is the kind of easy stuff most handsets can handle. If you have pleasant memories of the dozens of games that played like this, then Actraiser should be on your must-download list, as it provides a full afternoon of hacking action, complete with fun boss encounters.   Actraiser still looks great. There is a certain amount of charm to bright, colorful side-scrollers like this. Tall heroes thundering through detailed landscapes, beating down sizeable bad guys. The sprites in Actraiser look fantastic and possess a decent amount of animation. Also of note is the game's killer soundtrack. There's no sound effects, but the trade-off is worth it -- you get to hear some of the game's excellent music. It's just too bad there's no overworld music for you.", "date": "Aug 7, 2004"}
