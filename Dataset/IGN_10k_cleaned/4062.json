In fact, there have been quite a few off-road racing-style games released on the handheld in its short two-and-a-half year lifespan...and many of them turned out pretty well on the system. Kemco's Top Gear Rally brand, created for the Nintendo 64 system a half a decade ago, has been given new life on the Game Boy Advance. The game gets visual kudos thanks to a silky-smooth racing engine, but it's also very intuitive and user-friendly despite its professional appearance. Those looking to get a deep and detailed, technical rally racer won't get one here...but for a pick up and play driving game Top Gear Rally on the GBA is a really good one.FeaturesThree different cups Ten different locations Cartridge save (three slots) World Ranking password generator Link cable support for two players  Besides its name, Top Gear Rally for the Game Boy Advance doesn't share a whole lot with other games in the series. The Game Boy Advance version is a straightforward racing game where players work their way through three increasingly difficult circuits of ten different locations, each with three different legs of varying terrain. The task is, of course, to keep the vehicle on the right path in order to keep a top speed, as well as take turns with as much slide and as little braking as possible. Hitting roadside obstacles will bring your car to a halt, adding precious time to the clock and giving the opponents unnecessary distance. Players will have to pick the right vehicle for the task, as well as make a few adjustments for the different road conditions in order to beat the other seven drivers on the course. Top Gear Rally gives off the impression that it has a technical focus, but it's a bit deceptive since players don't have nearly the same customization controls here as they do in other rally racing games on the Game Boy Advance. Players can change the tires to the proper models, tweak the transmission between manual and automatic, and tighten or loosen up the car's steering, gearing, and braking to designated settings. That's pretty much it. There aren't any licensed vehicles in Top Gear Rally, either, opting for generic cars that look like the real deal. Even though the game's lack of settings customization and real cars might be a bit disappointing to those who like to get under the vehicle's hood, the pick-up-and-play design is a lot better for the casual gamer.  Nintendo's handling the North American distribution of this Kemco brand on the Game Boy Advance, and it's not surprising that the company's picking it up since the game's a impressive production.  For the handheld rendition Kemco went to Australian developer Tantalus. The team has worked with Kemco in the past with its still-unreleased Woody Woodpecker in Crazy Castle 5, and for the racing game Tantalus went with its proprietary GBA racing technology it developed for use in ATV Off Road Fury as well as the recently-released Monster Truck Madness. Third time's a charm as they say, and Top Gear Rally really shows how far the company's engine has gone. The racer it created for Kemco features the same silky smooth terrain generator and sprite manipulator for the roadside objects and computer-controlled vehicles, as well as a fully texture-mapped 3D vehicle for the player's own car. But in Top Gear Rally, the car models are more detailed and the track layouts are a lot crisper, cleaner, and prettier to look at. It also has one of the most amazing first-person modes of any racer on the GBA, which really gives off a serious sense of speed in the later rounds.  But it's clear that the engine has its limitations. The engine, for example, will restrict players from going the other way on the track; it's definitely possible to drive the opposite direction, but the camera never turns with the vehicle. This becomes a bit awkward when playing in the first-person camera view, since the camera will pull out of the vehicle cam whenever players lean their vehicle too far to the extreme left or right during a turn. Since the engine only allows three other opponents on-screen; as long as there are three vehicles in sight, the other opponents to the rear will never pass. And even though the player's vehicle is fully 3D and polygonal, it doesn't seem to feature Monster Truck Madness' ability to show vehicle damage during a race.  The game doesn't have any real focus on physics or car handling beyond the simple sliding around turns, and because of the limitations of the graphics engine players can't get too extreme with the sliding without causing the camera to lock its position awkwardly. Even tipping the vehicle, an admittedly cool effect, is just a canned sequence that doesn't do much but slow the player down and tell them that they took that turn too fast or hard. Even without the ~true~ physics, though, Top Gear Rally plays pretty well...if just a little on the ~arcadey~ side.  And at least Tantalus answered the complaints we had with the team's other racing games on the GBA. Top Gear Rally features an extensive ranking system that's saved to cartridge, recording the best times per leg of each track, as well as giving players the ability to save one ghost racer to cartridge for a little personal challenge. There's even an Internet Worldwide Ranking system in place: the game spits out a password that can be entered into an upcoming website so that players can put their best times against other players anywhere on earth. And, yep, Top Gear Rally also features a two-player link cable mode for head-to-head racing. All of these features increase the enjoyment of the standard racing mode. The third incarnation of Tantalus' racing engine is definitely the team's best, and it's great to see that the team injected a lot of what was blatantly missing from its previous two racers. While it's not the best rally racer on the Game Boy Advance (the little seen Colin McRae still has this one beat in gameplay), Top Gear Rally is a very enjoyable racer that might be a little light in customization, but it makes up for it in all the tracks and challenges that you have to race through. There's an excellent amount of racing to be had here.", "date": "Oct 24, 2003"}
