Some may like the idea a little more than others, but entertaining the notion of having that much power and influence can be a little appealing. More than that, the thought of living such a different life than we do everyday is pretty intriguing. Being able to be a part of the mafia without actually having to get your hands dirty in the real world is more to the point. Especially the part about not actually being shot at or actually going to prison to get shanked or made into somebody's girlfriend. GTA3 gave the world a pretty comical and way over the top look at the life of crime, but now we have Mafia from Illusion Softworks and Gathering of Developers. It moves almost more like ~a day in the life~ of a 30's gangster and does a damn good job of it. While I didn't like everything about the game, the plusses outweighed the minuses heavily and I was soon immersed in the life of Tommy Angelo as he retells his years as a gangster. The variety of shenanigans this guy manages to get in are pretty intense at times and entertaining almost all of the time.Looking for other Mafia game reviews? We've also reviewed the remake of the original, Mafia: Definitive Edition, as well as Mafia II and Mafia III.After waiting so long now for this one to get released, I'm glad to say that Illusion has finally managed to get their stuff together and come out with what is a pretty smooth running and almost completely bug free experience... a little different than some of their previous outings (Hidden & Dangerous). Not only did they manage that, but they also managed to craft an interesting, cinematic, and absolutely lovely journey through Tommy's mob life.LoadingPlayMafia takes up residence in the 30's, when prohibition was in force and the mob was at its glorious peak. Al Capone was ruling the streets of Chicago and Dons Salieri and Morello were in contention for another city. The city of Lost Heaven. Everything about this city and the entire game screams 30's style. The color pallete, model textures, the cars, the buildings, the way the people talk... everything is detailed and darn near perfect. There's so many little graphical details in the game its sick. Some of the textures are so finely detailed it'd make The Untouchables let themselves be touched by it. The entire game doesn't look quite that good however. Some textures when viewed up close (shirts and lapels especially) can be a bit blocky. But when taken in with the whole, they seemed to slip by into the corner of my consciousness while I gawked at the rest of the game.GTA3 had kind of the same thing going for it. A city built completely and hugely for your enjoyment. The difference is in the style. Everything in Mafia is just that much more real. The lighting and the colors make a huge difference in this as well as the superbly modeled cars you can drive around in, all of which are fully damageable including tires that can be shot out.The details and ambiance don't only reside in the visual side of the game either. Sound has been done to the nines here. Voices are some of the best I've heard in a game this year and add a whole lot of personality to characters that were already packed with it due to some good writing and terrific animation. Sound effects also shine. One level in particular takes place in the rain on a farm just outside of the city. You of course hear the rain falling on the ground around you as you move through the level, but as you pass near other objects like buildings and barrels, you start to hear the water splashing off of every different kind of material that you see. The rain sounds dull and thick against wood buildings, the metal barrels ting with metallic splashes and canopies resonate a dull echoing kind of thud from the drops. The addition of just that little bit more of realism adds to the tension that already comes dripping in that particular level.Even the music in the game, which I felt I had to talk about, is absolutely fantastic! From the swing music to the orchestrated score that ranges from the dramatic to the tense to the relaxing sound of the more personal and character building moments. The music just brings the game experience to a mightier cinematic level.Every level in the game comes with cinematic cut-scenes attached. All are rendered with the game's engine keeping the continuity, and thanks to some good lip-synch and great face textures and models, the characters are lively and personable. Camera work in these scenes is generally good and offers us more of the feel that we really are participating in a movie than any game in recent memory. Unlike some scenes I can think of (Operation Flashpoint), these are timed well and give us just what we need to set up the play. All of the scenes fill out an excellent story that works like an autobiography as Tommy sits and tells his story of growth, love, deceit, war and conscience over coffee at a diner. As I said before, the writing is pretty darn good for a game only entrenching my belief that every game should hire good writers to fill out what keeps growing as one of the most important parts to my PC game experiences.Gameplay in Mafia ranges from fantastic to kind of fun weighing much more heavily on the fantastic side. My main beef with the gameplay is that no matter what, I have to drive to whatever location my next mission takes place. Like the city in GTA3, Lost Heaven is one of those living breathing city dealies. So if you have to take care of something on the other side of town, you have drive to the other side of town to take care of it. I'm not complaining too much, but there were some times that I just kinda wished I could hit a ~skip and drive to location button~ when I really didn't actually have to drive there myself. Sometimes, when there's no time limit, there's nobody chasing you, and you don't have to worry about damaging your car, it can be a smidgeon on the slow side to drive across the city when you just want to get into the action, especially when you're getting stopped for speeding so often by the damn police. This isn't to say you can't make your own action by running away (that went quite disasterously and comically a couple times I tried it), but I figure that's what Free Ride is for anyway, but I'll get into that more in a second.But once you do get into the missions, you're in for quite a treat. The gameplay activities runs a pretty damn wide range. As you follow Tommy's life of crime, you'll take control of him and live out his memories of what happened. And Tommy wasn't just thug hitman. He worked his way up the chain. In fact, he started out as a cab driver. So at the beginning of the game, you'll get some cab driving missions, that while a little slow (especially since there were a few of them and I just wanted to get into the mob) afford you the opportunity to get to know the city a little bit before you start to terrorize... I'm sorry, ~protect~ it. From there you'll move your way up the ladder as a driver on missions, which sometimes go afoul so you'll have the chance to prove yourself as more important, and eventually will be counted as one of the upper echelon of the Salieri family. Over the course of the game you'll have to assassinate people, run bodyguard missions, fight enormous battles against rival hooligans, exact a little bit of revenge, as well as race, chase, and be chased in some of the 60 some vintage cars that are featured in Mafia.In fact, driving these cars around is a big part of the game. All of the cars suffers damage from dents and scratches, to blown tires that affects the way the car drives, to being riddled full bullet holes in the middle of a battle. This game has some fantastic chase scenes in it that any gangster fan will get a kick out of. Your passengers will hang out the side of the window shooting at your pursuers or pursuees. You can even take one hand off the wheel and hang your own self out the window to take some shots while driving. It's a little more difficult to drive while aiming, but that's to be expected.You directly affect what cars you can use at the beginning of any of the missions as well. As you progress through the game, a couple of different characters will teach you how to steal certain types of cars. You can then collect any cars you might like for your collection in the garage behind Salieri's bar. Any cars you don't want anymore can be removed to make room for your next best thing.Most of the missions in the game are at least challenging if not difficult. There's a fair share of those I was able to blow through and those that took me a few tries, but I think the mix is pretty good. Those that haven't had a whole lot of gaming experience may have some difficulty jumping in and being immediately successful. But the smooth camera, that actually surpasses Max Payne's, will help players adjust to what can sometimes be a confusing way to play a game. In fact, the interface is pretty good altogether. Inventory works well and pauses the game so that you can easily pick which weapon or item you'd like to use without the need to fumble while enemies are shooting at you. A nice map of the city is easily viewable while driving and picking up items on the ground is a cinch.You'll have traveled to every corner of the city by the end of the story mode, but chances are, you'll probably have missed out on some of the detail and some of the backstreets. That's where the Free Ride portion of the game sets in. This gives you the opportunity to jump into city and ride around without any story to get in your way. Various options allow you to control population, traffic, and police density as well as what kind of car you jump into the game with. You won't have all of the options available when you open the box though. You'll need to play through the single player portion of the game to unlock those. You'll unlock a completely new mode called Free Ride Extreme after completing the story mode so you can tour the city free of cops. You'll also be able to complete tasks that will unlock more special cars. All of this adds that extra bit of replay to a game that you should already want to buy only for the single player portion.I've been waiting for Mafia for a long time. The lack of information leading up to the release was as frustrating for me as it was for those of you out there looking for info. The wait and the secrecy was making me wonder at the status of the game and worried me more than a little bit that it may have fallen victim to the bug ridden curse of Illusion Softworks. But after getting my box copy, I've been playing it straight through to 4:30 today, when I started writing this review.Mafia is a great game with some minor problems that are easily forgotten once you get into the meat of the game. While I still wish that I could skip through some of the driving, it isn't anywhere near a big enough failing for me not to heartily recommend this game to anyone that likes action and especially those that love the depression gangster era. Mafia is dripping with style and class and has certainly shoved itself into the ranks of the best games of this year, which as you know has already had some incredible titles.", "date": "Aug 29, 2002"}
