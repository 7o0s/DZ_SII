The company's ESPN 2Night, while not great, showed a lot of promise, its X Games Snowboarding game was solid despite being overshadowed by SSX, and its Track & Field game was fairly good for what it is. While things were looking good for the new brand, the company has taken a big step in the wrong direction with ESPN National Hockey Night.   The game does feature the same excellent attention to visual presentation that were offered in the previous ESPN the Games titles, but the fancy menus, cool camera angles and the ESPN name just isn't enough to save an otherwise disappointing title.   Gameplay The biggest problem with the game is that its control is the worst that we've experienced in a hockey game in quite some time. Even 989 Sports' disappointing NHL FaceOff, pimps ESPN National Hockey Night in this key area.   Player control is completely unresponsive and even when you set the game's speed up to the highest possible setting, the controls still feel sluggish. It's as if you're controlling characters that are skating around a rink of molasses instead of ice. When the speed is jacked up, everything looks faster, the skaters move faster and the puck flies faster, but the responsiveness of the control is still completely lethargic.   What's more, the default button configuration for the controller is completely unintuitive and just don't make any sense. Luckily, it is possible to change the button mapping, so this isn't that big of a deal, but you still have to wonder what they were thinking when they set up the game. Switching players with the R1 button is not a good idea, and it seems like buttons were configured just to be different than the other hockey games on the system.   Regardless, whether you have the buttons mapped to a button that you feel comfortable with or not, the response time for when you press the button to when an onscreen action is performed seems a bit lacking. And as bad as things are in the area of control, it doesn't get better in the AI department.   Computer controlled players, on your team or the one you're playing against, seem to skate in patterns and will often just stand in one place while the user is skating around the ice with the puck. In fact, there was this one occasion where a puck was left untouched on center ice until the period ran out, which was approximately two minutes. This wasn't something I was able to recreate, but the fact that it did happen shows that the AI in the game needs some serious work.   If you can overlook the bad control and dismal AI, this game actually has a lot to offer in terms of play options. But, let's be honest here, nobody in their right mind could look past these problems, so I'm not even going to waste my time delving into what National Hockey Night offers in the way of play options and roster management because it's completely unimportant.   Graphics The sad thing about all of this is that there's actually a fairly decent game engine here. It's not quite as detailed as EA Sports' hockey title and has nowhere near as many cool lighting or shading effects, but it's definitely in the same league and is a tremendous leap past what 989 Sports gave us.   The players are highly detailed, the rinks have lots of extra little touches, the framerate is much smoother than EA Sports' NHL, and the animation can be quite good at times. On the other hand, the transition animation is really weak and players will often skate up the ice without moving any body parts, including their feet. Other than these few flaws, the graphics in the game are pretty good and there's no denying that this is a next generation game when it comes to its visuals.   Sound The commentary isn't quite as dismal as the gameplay, but it's definitely not a strong point for this title. The majority of the speech throughout the game is simply the play-by-play announcer monotonously saying the player's name that has the puck and nothing else. He or the color commentator will often chime in with something more exciting, but nothing here can be categorized as quality work.   The sound effects aren't nearly as bad, though, and there are plenty of cool background effects with the crowds, a nice PA announcer, and quality sound effects for the skating, the hitting of the puck and other basic hockey sounds.  ESPN National Hockey Night looks good, but that's the only thing that this title really has going for it. The player control is awful, the AI is completely laughable and the play-by-play and commentary work is completely substandard stuff. The only reason that someone would want to buy this game is...well, there is none. If you want a hockey game, you should get EA Sports' NHL 2001 and if you need a second game, 989 Sports' NHL FaceOff 2001 is a better choice than this, and that's saying a lot.", "date": "Apr 4, 2001"}
