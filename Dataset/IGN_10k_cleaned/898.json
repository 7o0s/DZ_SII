Indeed, baseball is America's sport and it should be treated with respect, and dignity, you know, like a chocolaty nugget. There are plenty of game developers looking to make games that deliver the feeling and fun of the game but it seems for the most part that PC developers are having a hard time doing it. The newest in the bunch of the baseball 2001 editions is EA's Triple Play 2001. But did this game really live up to the nugget level of goodness? Nope, and there are plenty of reasons why.  It seems like after making baseball games for such a long time, the people making the games would have figured out what exactly it is that makes baseball games fun. It is the graphics? Is it the gameplay? Is it the ability to run a team over a season? Is it all of the extra goodies put into the game? Well, it's all of these and I wish that some company would finally realize that. EA didn't. They managed to make a game that succeeded in giving players the options that they have gotten used to seeing in baseball games, but they failed in the execution of these said options.  So where should we begin? Let's go with the chocolaty covering on our would-be nugget commonly known as the graphics. As seems to be the norm with baseball games, the stands are terrible looking. At this point I think I might give a baseball game a 10 just for finally figuring out how to make the stands look acceptable without sacrificing game performance. They made an attempt at making the stands look better by putting up some flat cut out people in the front row around the stadium. Whoever thought of this should really go back to design school, because it actually makes the stands look considerably worse than if they had just left the crowd as a flattened texture.  Enough about the stands, onto the models of the players. I'm kind of wishy-washy about these models because they really aren't that good, but I can't rail on them too much for being bad because I've seen much worse. They do a good job approximating the size of the actual players, and the textures are passable, but I really didn't sit up in my seat at attention when I saw them. They look like every other basic model in baseball games. The animations that they assigned to the models were pretty good though. They were smooth, realistic, and fun to watch for the most part. Although I have to point out that when the players run to first they look like a monkey learning to run on two feet.  Unfortunately, the nugget really doesn't taste any better on the inside than it looks on the outside. Fielding isn't that difficult but is sluggish and really not very fun to play. One good thing is that for beginners they try to help out a little bit by having a huge arrow point from your fielder to where the ball is going. This was a good idea but the arrow just is too damn big and tends to confuse more than help.  Pitching and batting are the meat and potatoes of baseball right? This is where the game starts and what has to happen every single play. So you would think that this would be the part of the game that the developers would spend the most thought and time to make work in a fun and playable manner. The first side of this ugly quarter is the pitching. Maybe I'm a little spoiled by other games, but I think that this pitching scheme was one of the worst that I've played. Even the very limited pitching possibilities of RBI baseball for the original Nintendo was better that this. It works something like this; you get to pick your pitch type, then you get to pick where the ball will go. But the problem here is that there are only 17 different places that you can through the pitch (look for yourself at the bottom of the review). You can pick one of those boxes to pick from. Of course this screen only shows if you are using the mouse or keyboard to play. If you are using the gamepad, you pick whether you are going to throw a ball or a strike before you pitch and pick which box you will throw into by pointing in the direction you want the ball to go. Then you get to watch the ball sail over the plate or go way outside depending on whether you picked to throw a ball or a strike. I wouldn't recommend throwing balls ever as the computer swung at one ball I threw the entire time I played the game. This is extremely frustrating as the computer throws balls all of the time, but it is really hard to tell if they are going to be a ball or a strike before it is too late.  Which brings me to batting. Ugh. There are two choices for batting, easy and hard. Easy just requires you just press the swing button and lets you try to direct the ball by pressing up or down to get the ball to fly up, drive into the ground, or hit a line drive. This wasn't so hard, but it is really a matter of luck whether you get a hit or not. One interesting note on this as well is that you push up on the controller to hit the ball in the air. It took me a while to figure that out as in order to get under the ball and hit it in the air, your bat needs to undercut the ball.  Now batting in hard mode is really just an exercise in anger management. I had to keep myself from punching the screen out of frustration half of the time. Basically in hard you have to pick one of the nine strike zone boxes from the pitching interface. This of course is done on the fly and is incidentally very, very hard to hit as the computer gives you absolutely no indication of where the ball is going. So it becomes a guessing game as to where the ball is going to go and when to swing. I'm not sure if they realized this, but most people have issues with 3D environments on a 2D screen that doesn't allow for accurate depth perception. It is really hard to judge where the ball is in the space in order to be able to hit it. I'm not sure what possessed them to use this batting interface, but it is clunky and frustrating compared to a game like MS Baseball 2001.  One thing that isn't all that bad in the game is the sounds. The effects, crowd noise and music that plays over the PA system are pretty good and get the job done. The commentary isn't bad but it gets pretty repetitive. I have to gripe about the opening music however. They decided to remix Magic Carpet Ride by Steppenwolf and really muffed it up. Shame on y'all.  There are four options for game types to choose from including Big League Challenge, Season Mode, Playoff Mode, and Home Run Legends. The season mode allows for trading and has all of the options that you come to expect in a baseball game including the optional draft, and the ability to create new players. The game even allows you to put your face on a character in the game. The Home Run Legends is just a home run derby that pits the big hitters from all time against each other and while it's fun for a minute, isn't lasting fun. Big League Challenge is basically the same thing as the home derby as well, but if you play in Extreme Mode, then you can hit homeruns at targets in the outfield and score points.   If you were planning on buying a baseball game this year, then go and buy High Heat Baseball 2001 or MS Baseball 2001 and skip this game. At almost 40 dollars, this game is way too expensive for the quality considering MS Baseball is 10 dollars cheaper and has more options, looks just as good, and plays much better.  -- Dan Adams A lumbering and overly simple adaptation of EA's superb slugger, Triple Play 2001 is a trip back to the minors. Even Ken Griffy's simplistic and rushed gameplay knocks Triple Play's softballs out of the park, and nothing in this game reaches the professional levels of Acclaim's efforts. Choppy graphics, impracticable fielding, lax AI, no link play...  Four balls, take your base.", "date": "Apr 28, 2000"}
