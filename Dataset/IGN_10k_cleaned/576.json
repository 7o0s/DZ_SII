{"name": "40 Winks", "name_review": "40 Winks", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/23/40-winks-2", "text": "About an hour ago, we had two seven-year-old female game testers in the office to lend their opinion to a number of PlayStation games. Their overall opinion: videogames are fun, but way too hard.  Little kid games are just a bear to design. Some kids can hardly handle using the joypad and the buttons at the same time, others can't reach the shoulder buttons but can at least steer, and others still will mortify you by first perfectly beating you in Street Fighter with Zangief and then wiping a booger on your shirt. Your best bet is to make a game that will appeal to everyone, with cute characters, whimsical settings, and gameplay with a multi-tiered  difficulty.  In that respect, 40 Winks follows in the footsteps of Mario, Sonic, Crash, and innumerable others. Of course, there's always room for one more, and 40 Winks' Ruff and Tumble had a shot at winning some hearts. Eurocom's first original title (after farming out its programming skills for almost a decade on Mortal Kombat conversions and Disney licenses) was in many respects a dream project. It was a chance to get away from violence and cardboard characters, for the designers to make their own fantasies and reveries come to life. Sadly, this is the tale of a dream unfulfilled.   Gameplay In the land of dreams, there are creatures named Winks, which oversee all our nightly dreams and bring us good visions. They protect us from our nightmares and make everything wonderful. But grumpy old Mr. NiteKap, who's cranky like all old men are (except Mr. Belvedere), can't sleep, and that's gotten the old goat's gipper. In his insomnia, NiteKap is throwing a grandpa-sized hissy fit and has began capturing all of the dreamscape's Winks to turn them into monsterous, nightmare-bringing Hood-Winks. Now there are only 40 Winks left, and it's up to the outlandishly named children Ruff and Tumble to save the last few Winks and put NiteKap's evil plans to bed... permanently.  That's the set-up for what could have been a thrilling and mesmerizing voyage into the land of make-believe. And certainly 40 Winks has some well-done fantasy elements. For instance, Ruff carries a candle with him wherever he goes, while Tumble battles Hood-Winks with her teddy-bear. Both can leap into a Jack-In-The-Box and transform into other magical forms, such as an ogre (with a rumble with every blundering footstep), a magician, or a ninja. Collect and keep hold of Zzz's to stay asleep (ala Sonic's ring system) while you search for Moons, Cogs, Tokens, Dreamkeys, and Winks to complete your quest. Monsters are fairly smart and strong, so you'll have to use every weapon you have against them. The quest will take you to a pirate's cove, a tomb, a haunted house, and even the moon. Look for switches and explore the levels while collecting all the goodies.   And yet despite all the imagination in the graphics, story, setting, and overall artistry, the gameplay is textbook platforming. Battling enemies consists of punching them, firing ~screaming~ missiles, or butt-bouncing on them. No invention there. The game tries to make confrontations with enemies more complicated than Mario by giving opponents multiple hit points, but that just makes fights tedious. Levels are big, but fairly empty as far as interactive elements, so not only will players have to put in a lot of leg work to collect everything, but there's not much to do while you are backtracking. Controls are blocky, partly because the two lead characters are a couple of corn-fed plumpers -- even baby fat isn't that chubby.  And that's not to mention that the game is tough. Not super tough, and nothing that an average player couldn't run through in a day, but tough in reference to the age group that would want to play this. The theme skews very young, and so by the time gamers are old enough to really get a grasp on the challenge here, they will probably be mature and jaded Backstreet Boys fans too hip for such a childish premise. Typically, this is where a reviewer would insert a ~Too bad, because...~ and start raving about the brilliant yet destined to be neglected gameplay, but with 40 Winks, preteens wouldn't be missing much. That leaves only adolescents as the target age group, and the game might prove too much for such young gamers. Bottomless pits, acid and lava lakes, and rampaging monsters face you at every turn, and children will likely run through all of their extra lives quickly, even on the easiest setting. Mini-games races  pop up quite a bit, but they add little to the game and are more challenging than they need to be. The learning curve and multithreaded skill levels are just off-balance.  Another PlayStation kids game, The Smurfs, had an option for players not to lose a life, so kids could continuously challenge the game no matter how inexperienced they might be. 40 Winks could have done with some of that focus group thinking.  Graphics The fantasy style is very nicely done, with a sweeping color palatte and constant lighting effects. The graphics are sharp and well-drawn, with some ingenious additions such as the Dreamkey clock and the couches used to sit and save your place to memory card. The fanciful environments include a good number of realistic settings (such as libraries and bedrooms) as well as the more imaginative areas like the pirate ship and the haunted house. The game was as much a vanity project as it was a creative expression, as Eurocom has filled 40 Winks full of effects. Ruff's candle leaves a motion-blur trail as he swings his candle (like a sparkler), and rain and thunder effects are common. Many of the areas and objects in the game glow with vivid iridescence. Most of the effects are staged trickery (for instance, lights aren't 100% true, and Ruff's candle doesn't light up the exterior), but the visual integrity is still very nice.   The look is hurt, however, by an awful camera system, which obstructs the gamplay often. The camera is fast when you don't need it to be, swinging wildly around your character during tough jumps. Other times, the camera is in the wrong position, taking a behind-the-back perspective when an overhead or side view would be best. Also, some of the visual elements were poorly designed, making exploring almost too difficult to bother. Caves often go black, so finding the way around in an area is confusing. Underwater areas have few distinguishing features, so players may circle around an area without even knowing it and run out of air.   Sound Pleasing, if not pioneering sounds fill the game. Some pleasant but inconsequential music is generated here, and I like the silly use of vocals -- Wakey Wakey, your clock companion, speaks in mumbles. There are also some nice sound effects, such as the piano that will play a different chord depending on where you stomp on it. Other than that, it's all standard platformer ~Hi-Ya~ and ~Ow!~ samples. The voice acting in the FMV is quite good (as are the beautifully rendered intro and sequence scenes themselves), but it would have been more fitting to have that same quality voice in the game itself.I hate coming down on this game. It pains me to be a bastard and take down the product of somebody's labor of love. And this was Eurocom's big chance to come out, to get away from all those Midway translations and Disney titles (which were fine games, but they allowed very little room for expression), and to make an artistic statement. The designers even put a compassionate goodbye to ~Long lost family and friends~ in the credits. This was a game that many people cared about, that artists and programmers and marketing agents all came together on as something they wanted to do. And it's such a heartrending story, as the sales on the title have been less than impressive, and GT Interactive is now considering quietly putting to rest the Nintendo 64 version of the game. But GT may be right, and maybe this is just one for everybody to just put behind them and move on. There's no crying in gaming.", "date": "Dec 23, 1999"}
