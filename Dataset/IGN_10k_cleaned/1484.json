For example, I still believe that Virtual On: Oratorio Tangram incorporates some of the most dazzling gameplay mechanics ever in a game.  The number of emails calling me all sorts of colorful names demonstrates that there are people out there that don't like the game at all... I can respect that.  However, for all our different choices in games, there are definite lines that everyone nearly agrees on; for example, I have yet to find someone who actually enjoys playing Superman 64.  This is one of the universal lines drawn, one that won't change beyond an act from the gaming gods above.  So, in marches Army Men: Sarge's Heroes for the Dreamcast, a port of the N64 and PlayStation versions that stand out as one of the most mediocre games ever made.  Of course, 3DO isn't interested in translating their best-selling ~brand name~ Army Men games to the Dreamcast; but they don't mind licensing out the Army Men name to Midway so that Midway can publish a mediocre game on the Dreamcast.  Don't get me wrong, Midway... it's not you.  For that matter it's not the Saffire development team either, as they have done an admirable job of porting the exact game to the Dreamcast... they even up'ed the frame rate in some parts as well.  The problem isn't the concept of the game: as Sarge, you must rescue your compatriots from the clutches of the sinister Tan army.  The thought of controlling a miniature, plastic commando throughout various everyday settings has a certain appeal.  You've got a number of weapons like the flamethrower, mortar, and sniper rifle (cues in Metal Gear Solid music) to deliver to thy Tan army great vengeance and furious anger, and 16 missions with various objectives.  The concept of this game is quite sound... delivering visuals and gameplay worth enjoying was the problem that plagued the original Army Men: Sarge's Heroes and it continues on the Dreamcast.  Though the frame rate is smoother in certain places and the visuals are cleaner, the graphics are just plain old and average.  Explosions are a combination of three red colors morphed together, textures are just plain, and the view of the battlefield... well, there's just nothing that catches your attention.  This is not Dreamcast quality visuals, especially when we've seen such intricate detail in Shenmue, Quake III Arena... even Sonic Adventure, a first generation Dreamcast title, blows Sarge's Heroes to the moon.  And why does it seem like every Tan army soldier you kill have this antagonizingly long death animation?  When you first play Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, the action sequences seem pretty cool, especially since you're blowing up stuff all over the place.  The control mechanics are somewhat suspect; though there are some major problems with the jumping mechanics and collision detection, laying death to everything tan is pretty fun.  Then comes the realization that, beyond some light jumping sequences, there is nothing beyond blowing the same enemies and vehicles up and using the same weapons over and over again.  The game gets boring very quickly and while multi-player deathmatch might seem lengthen the replay value, when you have the choice between Quake III Arena or Army Men: Sarge's Heroes to play deathmatch among friends, what are you going to pick?  It's also worthy to note that if you choose to play a three player deathmatch game, the screen is divided into two small screens and one long screen.  Thus, whoever gets the long screen has a definite viewing advantage over the other two players, something I found kind of odd to add.  So, why the heck is this mediocre game coming out on the Dreamcast?  Some will say that it is the video game company's fault for releasing an boring game.  Others might state that development team who performed the translation should of added new extra to the Dreamcast version.  Well, the answer is simple folks... most gamers out there are content with mediocrity.  We raise our voices, crying why this awesome game didn't sell as well as this third rate game.  But so long as there is a good percentage of gamers that settle of mediocre titles, companies will continue giving the people games like Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, a game that should not even be seen in the Dreamcast line-up.  --Anthony ~non-plastosheen~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
