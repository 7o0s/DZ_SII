And a real man, Arthur, of the Ghosts/Ghouls/Goblins series of side-scrolling action/platformers from Capcom, has been doing just that for 20 years  beginning in the arcade, traveling then to the NES, and later arriving on the Genesis. Which is where we're going today.    Ghouls 'N Ghosts starred Sir Arthur, unarmored and in underwear, for the second time on a home console. It was a launch title for SEGA's 16-bit platform back in 1989, and with its near-perfect re-creation of its arcade inspiration, early adopters of the Genesis must have been well pleased with this GNG's gameplay, challenge and style  all of which hold up today. Must be some pretty tough polyester in those pantaloons.   Playing as Arthur, you embark on an adventure through a set of environments that are dark and dreary, but have a cartoon flare. Like Castlevania with a sense of humor, you'll take on undead monsters, gargoyles and dragons, but also enemies like a magician with the power to transform you into a duck. The underwear thing is a joke, but is also a key part of the gameplay  Arthur begins each level in a full suit of armor, but if he takes a hit the armor is knocked away, leaving him in nothing but boxer shorts. If he takes another hit in that form, he'll lose a life.     And losing lives is a frequent occurrence in Ghouls 'N Ghosts, as the challenge level here is considerable. You'll find yourself dying over and over again as you formulate the best strategy for dealing with each platforming sequence or boss encounter. Luckily, GNG gives you unlimited continues and mid-level checkpoints to offset any frustration factor. With a little persistence, you'll make it through to the end.   New for Ghouls 'N Ghosts over its predecessor, Ghosts 'N Goblins, is a difficulty selector that lets you tone down the intensity a bit for an easier adventure. There's Professional Mode, but also Practice Mode  you'll find things a bit more forgiving with the latter.   And also new are some of Arthur's abilities, like his new weapons, enhanced attack range and armor upgrade. The first Ghosts 'N Goblins was fairly basic in outfitting Arthur's arsenal, but this time he can find axes and swords in addition to his standard throwing lance, and can direct assaults upward to attack airborne enemies. The Magic Armor further boosts his potential to bring the pain, as wearing it and holding down the attack button lets you unleash powerful spells like fire blasts and lightning strikes.   Newcomers to the series should heed the warning that GNG's controls take a little getting used to, as Arthur's jumping in particular has a unique feel. He can't change direction in mid-air like almost every other platforming hero from his same era, so you have to plan your leaps with more thought. And this installment is definitely still old-school in that regard  later games in the series introduced double jumps, edge-gripping, and other enhancements to make things more forgiving. Not this one. Jump wrong here and it's Game Over time for the good sir knight.Ghouls 'N Ghosts is the second game in Capcom's Arthur series, placing it chronologically between the original Ghosts 'N Goblins (which came to the NES) and Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts (for the SNES). And its gameplay is something of a balance betweens those two titles as well  it's enhanced in feel and depth over the NES original, but it isn't quite as robust or as extreme a challenge as the SNES game to come after. Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts, appropriately enough, is already available on the Virtual Console as well, for the same asking price of 800 Wii Points. And given a forced choice between just the two, we'd recommend Super over this version. But this Genesis GNG is perfectly solid on its own, and a great conversion of a fun arcade sequel. Give it a download to re-experience one of the most impressive launch titles the Genesis had to offer, now almost 20 years ago.", "date": "Sep 15, 2007"}
