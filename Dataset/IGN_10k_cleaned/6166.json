{"name": "Space Bunnies Must Die", "name_review": "Space Bunnies Must Die", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/12/10/space-bunnies-must-die", "text": "Space Bunnies Must Die falls well within the family of recent Tomb Raider knock-off games. From the ~sexy~ lead character and her acrobatic abilities to the way the action is controlled, there is no denying the inspiration for this game. That said, Space Bunnies is not without its own unique charm. The concept of evil space bunnies, alone, is good for a laugh and the promise of menacing bunnies from space is diligently kept throughout the game. Unfortunately, the overall strength suffers from a lack of polish in the game control, graphics, and stability.  The action is kicked into high gear when truck stop waitress Allison Huxter witnesses her sister being abducted by aliens. Allison, who just happens to be a rodeo star in her spare time, wastes no time heading into the heart of the space bunny stronghold. Once inside, she encounters a slew of evil bunnies and cartoonish environmental challenges more reminiscent of Mario Bros. than Tomb Raider. Allison must also collect a variety of important items including carrots, which the bunnies use to fuel their transporters, and CDs, which are used to ease the bunny's violent demeanor. Along with special items, Allison can also find up to eight different weapons, all of which do a good job of eliminating rabbits.  Once the initial ~Infiltration~ level is completed players can choose any of the game's eight other levels. And although the game boasts ~no repeat texture-mapping,~ the levels are largely similar in gameplay, featuring a series of corridors, lava/acid pits, and space bunnies jumping out from behind corners.  Where Space Bunnies suffers is in its unpredictable gameplay control. To complete each level, players must do a fair share of jumping, running, dodging, and climbing. Unfortunately, what makes these challenges so tough is not the clever level design, but rather the clunky controls that inevitably lead to an inordinate amount of repeating steps. One dubious example that leads to more than its fair share of frustration is the safety walk feature (made popular in Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider). As in Tomb Raider, this feature is used to walk the character right up to the edge of a platform so that she may look over the edge or perfectly judge her next jump. In theory, this feature is a blessing, unfortunately in Space Bunnies it rarely works right and leads to lots of missed jumps and various other time-consuming mistakes.  The game also features such popular imperfections as characters hanging in mid-air, getting hung-up on invisible corners, and choppy animation. Of course, none of these things by themselves will break a good game, but it's these kind of shortcomings that create a lingering feeling of disappointment over Space Bunnies Must Die. Yes, it's funny that the enemies are mutant space bunnies, and it's even funnier that the lead character can take a break from the action any time she feels like dancing. But, without solid gameplay and control to back them up, these elements feel even more like gimmicks then they really are.  -- Patrick Baggatta", "date": "Dec 10, 1998"}
