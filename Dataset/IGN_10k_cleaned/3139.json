That game, Serious Sam become a critical and financial success.  It was followed a year later by Serious Sam: The Second Encounter more an extension of the first than a sequel.  The two games were so similar and matched so well, it seemed only natural that they be packaged together.  That's exactly what developer Croteam has done by bringing both encounters to Xbox in one edition called, simply, Serious Sam.  With humorous cut-scenes added, some lighting improvements and better multiplayer options than its PC cousin, Sam hopes to be taken seriously by an Xbox audience still in awe of Halo.  While Serious Sam won't have you throwing your copy of Halo out the window, it will offer a good distraction and is clearly a different experience than the traditional first-person shooter.  And that's just how it was designed -- as the non-thinking man's shooter.  A twich shooter, if you will.  A run and gun blast-em-up.  And on that level it works perfectly.  Features  Contains both Serious Sam PC games Fast-action FPS Blast your way through 36 levels Take on dozens of enemies at once Multiplayer deathmatch and co-op modes let you have fun with friends Stereo cut-scenes and 5-channel in-game sound  Gameplay Serious Sam isn't to be confused with a thinking man's FPS like Medal of Honor or Halo.  Instead, Sam is more of a reaction shooter like Doom.  Your goal is to run around and kill everything in sight.  There are very few puzzle elements (and even those are very minimal), because this game isn't about outsmarting your enemies, it's about blowing them to bits.  Enemy AI is very simple as well.  They attack.  There's no hiding, no running away, just charging in and trying to widdle away at Sam's health.  And your goal as Sam is to do exactly the same to them.  There's no crawling on your belly or hiding behind walls.  Instead, you run around shooting anything and everything that moves, squeals, or looks ugly enough to be dangerous.  The result is a non-stop, always fun, action title that will please fans of the mindless shooter genre.  If you want Ghost Recon please wander off to another area of the site.  If you want a guy with a Bruce Campbell attitude, an arsenal of weapons, and plenty of bloodlust, then read on.  A Serious Story Sam ~Serious~ Stone's story really has no importance.  There are bad guys and you've got to kill them.  You do a bit of time traveling, ride in an alien spaceship (only through a cut-scene), and spelunk through some pyramids and cavernous dungeons.  All the while you get updates from your NETRICSA system, which is essentially a computer manual.  This gives you important information on level objectives, enemies and weapons.  The only problem is you get messages about an enemy whenever you meet them for the first time in any level.  So when you come across a fireball-hurling demon in one level, you get a message.  And then when you meet them again in another level, the same message.  Through 36 levels, that can get annoying.  And what makes no sense is that you don't retain this info for later levels.  So if you learn something about an enemy in one level, you can't reference on a later level (or in the menus) until you run into them again.  Okay, why is that?    Serious Weaponry Sam steps to the plate with more than just a knife and some attitude.  There are fifteen weapons in the game, though a few you won't be able to access until you reach the second half of the game.  There are some FPS standards, like ~Old Painless~ the minigun, a flamethrower, and rocket and grenade launchers.  Plus a few others are thrown in for balance including the Serious Bomb.  Hard to find, these little bombs destroy everything on screen (unless you're fighting a boss).  The weapons are cool and Sam will sometimes offer a quip when he discovers a new piece of hardware.    Cycling through weapons is as easy as pressing the A and B buttons, and you can set your two favorite weapons to the X and Y buttons.  Switching is quick and painless so it's never a problem getting to a necessary weapon quickly.  There's plenty of ammo to be found, so you'll often be able to keep your fave weapons around with fresh supplies.  Aiming is loose and it needs to be because you've got to be able to move the target across the screen quickly.  Though most of the weapons are standard fare, one cool newcomer is the cannonball.  You literally tote around a cannon, firing big cannonball blasts, which bounce off walls and explode after a few seconds.  A great way to take out multiple enemies, though it would have been nice to hear a few pirate jokes from time to time with this one.  Serious Enemies No game would be complete (or any fun) without some enemies and Sam must contest with quite a number of grisly beasts to make it through all 36 levels.  You get giant green demons, chainsaw wielding pumpinheads, demon frogs, half-dressed harpies, suicidal runners who scream so their presence is know, and many more.  No new integration was added, so enemies added for the PC's Second Encounter won't show up until halfway through the game.  It's not that bad, actually, because it helps keep the game fresh as new enemies and a few new weapons will pop up once you've completed the first eighteen levels.  Some enemies are true classics that will be remembered for a long time to come.  The bulls charging are a pain in the ass, but man is it cool to see them coming.  The real surprise, though, is when they suddenly show up with cannons strapped to their backs.  Yowch!  The suicide runners, who charge at your holding bombs and screaming their lungs out, are by far the best thing in Serious Sam.  But there are others, like the harpies (who often carry and drop in suicide runners) and the pumpkinhead chainsawing hicks.  And get used to these enemies, because you're going to be seeing an awful lot of them.    Enemies come like bunches of oats, so many that at times they nearly fill the screen.  As you blast away your score ticker increases (yeah, you actually get a score... arcade anyone?) and you'll have levels with over 500 total enemies at times.  Many areas of the game, in fact almost every other level, is set up like a gauntlet.  You fight one wave of enemies and then once defeated a second wave of tougher enemies appears.  This goes on for sometimes ten minutes as wave after wave of goons comes to meet their end at the hands of Serious Sam.    Serious Gameplay Serious Sam offers endless waves of action.  In fact, you will rarely have moments without action.  Considering most levels take between twenty and thirty minutes to finish (some even longer), that's a heck of a lot of shooting to be had across 36 levels.  Puzzle elements were added to the second edition of Sam, which means that there's a distinctive split between the two games.  Though packaged as one continuous experience, there is a clear line of when the first Sam ends and the Second Encounter begins.    For one thing, there really aren't any puzzle elements in the first half of the game.  But in the second half there are a few minor (and simple puzzles) ranging from platform puzzles to one where you actually need to spell out a word by jumping up and down on an alphabet floor.  It's a clear shift in gameplay, though action remains predominant.  It would have been nice to see a couple of these types of puzzles placed in the first half of the game, though, to add some continuity.  Another notable are the power-ups, which don't exist in the first half of the game.  But come the second half, you'll be able to pick up invulnerability, speed boosts, and Serious Damage power-ups.  Why couldn't these have been thrown into the mix in the first half?  It just seems strange to suddenly see them popping up halfway through.  The emphasis here is action and there's oodles of it.  The action doesn't stop coming.  The action hits you from all directions, just like the PC version.  The problem here is that you can turn around much more quickly with a mouse and keyboard.  You will get hit from behind a lot.  And you will die sometimes simply because you can't turn yourself around fast enough.  A 180 degree turnaround button would have helped immensely here, but unfortunately there's no such thing in Serious Sam.  The cheap hits can get a little annoying and you will absolutely die again and again in this game.  However, none of it is particularly difficult.  Despite dying a lot, you will earn tons of extra lives.  You get one every time you score 100,000 points.  You'll tend to end up with about 6-10 extra lives for each level.  Slowly you'll build an army of extra lives.  You can easily get to the final boss with over thirty lives (which will then quickly disappear thanks to a tough final battle).    Serious Fun The bottom line is that, though Serious Sam isn't a perfect game by any means, it is a lot of fun.  It's incredibly addictive.  There could have been even more humorous moments from Sam.  The quips are great but come few and far between.  You won't drool at the visuals or be blown away by the sound or gameplay, but Serious Sam has the intangibles that make it fun.  And really fun is the only thing you should be seeking here.  No speeches about evil America, no customizations, no deep storyline.  It's all about kicking ass.    Serious Multiplayer Serious Sam offers four-player deathmatch and two-player co-op through either split screen of system link.  The game chops a bit more in co-op, because there's just way too much happening on screen at once.  Despite this, it's nice to have multiplayer available.  With nine additional characters, you won't be playing as two Sam clones.  Instead, each player can have a unique character with their own style and personality.  Chose from the likes of King Kim, Santa Sam, and Groovy Gregory.  Deathmatch really isn't that great.  There are ten levels to choose from in Deathmatch, each of them of decent size.  But the whole point of Serious Sam is being attacked by scores of baddies at one time.  So a deathmatch is a bad idea, because then it's just you against (at most) three other people.  Yawn.  Co-op, though, is a fantastic way to play through the game.  You can go through the entire game, from start to finish, with a buddy through split-screen or system link.  The game gets a little tougher this way, mainly because there's no extra ammo and you've got two people.  Options here are minimal but you can toggle friendly fire and increase the default lives to a max start of 10.  Not only is it a life pool, but it's also a score pool.  you share lives and your score.  True co-op play.  The only thing that makes no sense is how the split-screen is divided.  Rather than splitting across the full horizon, split-screen puts giant black borders on each side of the screen.  Yeah, because I want my field of vision even smaller?  Oy.  But system link is a perfect option if you want to play co-op.  Serious Blood Couldn't leave the gameplay section without mentioning my favorite addition to Serious Sam on Xbox.  You can choose the color of blood.  Green and red are there as they should be, after all they are the standards.  But added for Xbox is hippie blood.  Shoot an enemy and they bleed flowers.  Rather than bloodstains when they die, enemies leave flower power graffiti.  Ingenious.    Graphics Though there's been plenty of time between the PC and Xbox versions, little has changed graphically.  Actually, in many ways the Xbox version has taken a step backwards from the original PC versions.  Though there are some nice lighting effects (not nearly in the upper-echelon of Xbox lighting excellence, but not bad) and a score of new, humorous cut-scenes added, Serious Sam has some serious graphic problems.    For the most part, the framerate remains stable, but there are plenty of times where it will chop up, particularly in multiplayer co-op.  Considering how many enemies come at you at one time, it's no surprise.  The framerate never drops too heavily though, instead it will drop 5 or so frames here and there.  It's not often in single-player, though.  The more immediate and curious problem comes with what appears to be v-synch problems.  Almost never seen on a console game (I can only think of one other instance), this game essentially has v-synch turned off.  Something seemingly exclusive to the PC, v-synch basically keeps the game from artifacting.  Turn it off and the framerate may improve, but the game suffers some visual hiccups.  This makes no sense since TVs have basically the same refresh rate, but whatever is going on in the graphics engine, it's the same experience as a PC with no v-synch.  Essentially, when you turn, you can actually see the screen refreshing, creating misconnecting lines on the screen that can best be described as wrinkles.  You may watch Serious Sam in action, turn and say, ~that doesn't look right, but I don't know why.~  For a game that requires you to turn often, this can become quite annoying and it will occur even when there are no enemies onscreen.  In addition to this, the character models look almost of original Doom quality, which just doesn't cut it for the next generation of consoles.  Enemies have a great variety and they are incredibly distinct and unique.  However, their animations often seem stilted and not varied at all.  You see one screaming suicide bomber run at you, you've seen 'em all.  And while textures look nice from far away, they look terrible up close.    But all is not lost for Sam.  The redesigned Sam is a bit more friendly to the eyes and better matches the game's comic nature.  And, as I said just a few sentences ago, the enemies are well-designed.  Sam is a different breed of FPS.  Not dark and brooding at all, the game is full of bright colors, which make it visually appealing despite the technical flaws.  The lighting is solid and there are some good explosions, but overall Serious Sam is an average looking game with moments of goodness.    Sound Sound plays an important role in Serious Sam, as enemy voices will give you an indication of their location.  And with enemies coming at you from all sides at all times, this is vital.  In fact, gamers with only stereo ability will be at a disadvantage from those with surround sound.  Hearing a mad-bomber screaming his lungs out, for example, tells you where he's charging from.  In stereo, if you're turned at a wrong angle (say with your back to the bomber), you won't even hear him scream.  Get it right and you can get a good idea of where exactly the scream is coming from.  In surround, though you'll hear enemies from all sides.  Oddly, the in-game is 5-channel but the cut-scenes are only in stereo.  Sam comes to Xbox with a solid score with some good variety.  The music always picks up when the enemy threat increases, which helps add to the insane intensity.  Sam offers his own running commentary on the action, though you will generally only get one or two sound bytes for each level.  When Sam talks, it's usually funny.  ~It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye,~ Sam says after chopping a spongy looking dude in half with his chainsaw.  Sam gives off a Bruce Campbell vibe and it would have been nice to hear more of the disgruntled Mr. Stone.  While Sam jabbers, the aliens you fight offer mainly shrill cries or mad screams, which is a bit of a let down because there seems plenty of room for some alien smack talk.  Serious Sam accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.  It's a fun, mindless spoof of action games.  It's an absolute blast to play.  It is exactly what it sets out to be -- a mindless, fun shooter.  The fact is, the game actually seems a bit strange when puzzle elements are added (as occurs in the second half of the game).  I love Sam in short bursts.  A few hours here, a few there.  The gameplay, unfortunately, wasn't properly tweaked for the console world as a 180 button would have helped tremendously.  You just can't maneuver as quickly with a controller as you can with keyboard and mouse and Serious Sam is one of the best examples of this.  The battles get really hectic and though it will get repetitive if you just try and play it all the way through in one weekend, it is mindlessly fun.  Not the best technical example for an Xbox game but a good step on the road to future Serious titles.  If you just want to go around shooting things for a while and have a good laugh while you're at it, Sam's definitely you man.", "date": "Nov 4, 2002"}
