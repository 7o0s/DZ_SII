As despite its storied commercial failures, recurrent mediocrities, and rare successes in the last couple of years, its team has continued to plow forward in an attempt to knock the socks off faithful videogame owners. This year in particular has looked decidedly strong for the Chicago-based publisher, as titles like SpyHunter 2, The Suffering, and NBA Ballers all seem poised to take the market by surprise and deliver a solid lineup for the fall.   But our dwindling summer schedule must first welcome another, less heralded member of the Midway family: the lighthearted airplane racer named Freaky Flyers. Developed in-house over the past two seasons, Freaky Flyers is a bouncy, cartooned approach to the oft-emulated cart racing genre. Boasting incredibly high production values, a solid visual engine, and the funniest damn characters we've seen in eons, Midways appreciated attempt at joke-based software has managed to win us over on a spectrum of different levels. But not without running into its share of problems.   Gameplay  Following the typical kart racing structure, Freaky Flyers offers the standard set of options and features that we've all come to expect. There are 15 characters in all, each with their own unique background stories, designs, and control guidelines, and every single last one of them is as unique as they are colorful. Pilot X, for instance, is a mysterious alien aviator from outer space while Sheik Abdul is an oil billionaire from the East that loves to race on his flying carpet. There are other oddities too, like the child genius Sammy Wasabi or the German genetic experiment Traci Torpedoes, but known of them are as bizarre as the nut job Marcels Moreso. A self-arguing Siamese twin that works as a mime, it's one of the creepiest (and funniest) combinations we've ever seen.    These differences between characters translate into the races well, with certain personalities moving faster or more accurately than others, and the remaining set possessing stronger constitutions or better maneuverability. It seems to have far more variety between the pilots in terms of control than most recent genre installments (re: Butt-Ugly Martians), and other than a few minute similarities, can offer different experiences. The setup and method of control, however, is just as familiar here as it is anywhere else. With an accelerator, fire button, brake, stunt button (for avoiding obstacles or fire), and a reticule toggle. As an added bonus, players can shoot behind them as well, which makes for a handy butt-saver when under heavy fire. The bottom line here is: if you've played any other kart racer before, Flyers will feel like second nature within the first few seconds of gameplay.   Where Freaky Flyers really makes itself distinguishable (other than the blatant humor approach) is the open-ended nature of its stages. Incredibly huge and populated with obstacles, shortcuts, and other racers, you can pretty much do whatever you want in a given level. So while your buddy may want to stick to the path and follow the rest of the pack as they journey over a mountain, your decision-making could fly you inside that mountain instead. And to further unfasten these possibilities, some shortcuts have further alternate paths once you're traveling on them. It really livens up what could otherwise turn into a repetitive gameplay experience.    Which is the area where Freaky Flyers begins to falter. Since every character is different, you'll need to beat each individual stage one per personality if you want to race with them in standard or story mode. And while it's great that each character plays and reacts differently between each other, that doesn't necessarily mean that players will actually want to use all of them when they're competing It's this flaw of design that can quickly turn a quick romp into an extreme pain in the ass. The longevity is definitely there, but it's forced and not conducive to user-initiated replay.   Also, despite the ideal to insert six sub-goals in each level, the system doesn't really work out. The only way for players to unlock secret missions or characters, the sub-goals are quests that are extra feats for the middle of a race. And while some of these sub-sets are typically easy by nature (hit all the red targets, shoot down your enemies), some of them can get pretty hectic. So hectic in fact, that it's not very likely that you'll be able to finish them and still stay competitive in the race. Believe it or not, Freaky Flyers turns out to be a pretty difficult game, and if you make the decision to complete all six sub-goals to unlock something, you'll probably finish out of the top three the majority of the time. Unfortunately, these completed goals do not carry over into the next time you race that track, which means more forced reasons to fly through a stage when you may not want too.   If you can weather the storm and prove that you can stand up to this war of attrition, however, then Freaky Flyers can turn out to be a lot of fun for you and one of your buddies (there's four-player madness if you nab it on Xbox). Sporting a multitude of weapons, various techniques, and a ton of mini-games, Flyers should keep you busy for quite some time (Bandito Attack absolutely rocks). It's just wanting to stick with it that's the trick.    Graphics  Artistically Freaky Flyers is reminiscent of titles like Wacky Races and other Hanna-Barbara inspired cartoons. Overemphasized body parts, pronounced facial features, and larger than life costume designs are the style of choice, and it fits in perfectly with the comedic tone. In fact, the game as a whole reflects the designer's cheery nature with bright and colorful stages, and plenty of subtle slapstick animation in every stage. From a flock of birds that loses feathers when you fly by to lost hikers building campfires in the snow, there's always something going on in the background.   Particle effects and lighting techniques are in frequent use as well, and the textures used for the larger landscapes are varied and never repeat. Obstacles can change and be altered as well, so it's not uncommon to find trees falling, boulders crumbling, or new paths opening up all within the span of a single stage. It all looks legitimately cool, and it's entirely user-reactive which is a nice bonus.   Unfortunately there's a trade-off. Since the worlds are so busy and populated with your own and competing craft, the vehicles are pretty small and lack the detail that the environments have. Also bothersome is that projectile fire and explosions can sometimes get lost in the background because of how active they are. In the latter stages this can pose a big problem, as things can get pretty ridiculous when you explode because of nearly invisible fire. Luckily the framerate stays at a solid 60 or slightly below for the longevity of your excursions. A pretty impressive feat if you ask us.    Sound  It's not the stereo or surround sound options that make the game's audio so powerful, it's the vocals. Supplied by the same cast that powered the speech behind Haven and Ready 2 Rumble, Freaky Flyers' talented verbal panel is among the best we've heard in a long time. And while it's great to hear such grand attention given to this aspect of the game, it's not the reason the aural integrity is pushed into the next level: that culprit is the dialogue. Incredibly humorous (albeit stereotypical) and witty, Freaky Flyers has the funniest cut scenes this side of Leisure Suit Larry. The small group of writers responsible deserves a lot of credit for this, and the actors should get a pat on the back for such a solid delivery.   Musically Freaky Flyers is almost as funny, and the songs that have lyrics are drop-dead hysterical (just listen to the Bandito theme song for absolute proof). Compositions that don't have words are still pretty strong, and each and every one is designed specifically with a theme in mind. Sure it may not be on the same level as the epic RPGs that always receive so much praise for their soundtracks, but for a game of this type, it's among the strongest. Sound effects, however, aren't nearly as strong but they do hold up. And the frequent racer quips and ambient sounds make the environments that much more alive.A fun idea that manages to capture the entertainment value of kart racing without making too many compromises, Freaky Flyers is surprisingly entertaining. It's comical, smart, and deeper than we imagined. It's likely that fans of challenging games and enthusiasts of the genre will enjoy this more than your typical player, but there's enough appeal here to attract just about anybody.Sadly, the need to complete everything individually and the balancing issues with the sub-goal missions could prove to be a major problem for the casual gamers willing to give it a chance. Notwithstanding, Freaky Flyers is still a pretty cool little game and it deserves at least one session of solid play testing. If you're not going to do it for you, then do it at least for the banditos!", "date": "Aug 6, 2003"}
