Brainstorm up a list of some of the most common unrealized human fantasies, and nine times out of 10 that list will include both flight (given that centuries of arm-flapping have still produced no real results for humanity) and the destruction of stuff on a large scale (given that civilization has rendered this an unacceptable form of entertainment). Coincidentally, the two things fighter jets are built to do. Videogames are nothing if they are not fantasy fulfillment, and so a good fighter sim has its audience ready and waiting for it.   Ace Combat 4: Shattered Skies is almost inarguably the best fighter sim ever made for a console, so Namco probably shouldn't be too worried about how this one's going to do. It's not necessarily a rethinking of the Ace Combat style of gameplay, but then it didn't need to be -- Ace has always had just about the right balance between arcade and simulation presentation for a console game (with Air Force Delta sitting too far to the left and PC sims off in their own world far to the right). Rather, this is still Ace Combat...just much, much bigger.   And much better-looking, but that likely goes without saying. You've seen screenshots, you've seen movies, you've probably heard us gush far more than absolutely necessary, but for all its massive scale, AC4 also manages to draw its world in remarkably fine detail. The result is another one of those games that looks almost real, to the point where you can't quite peg exactly what it is that tips you off it's a videogame. But then thank goodness it's a game, since flapping your arms is a pretty tiring affair, and this kind of property damage would certainly raise complications...    Gameplay  Like its predecessors for both arcade and console platforms, Ace Combat 4 is what you could call an arcade-style simulation. The control is spot-on, especially with the analog sticks, but just a little bit limited in comparison to the Jane's school. You have control of throttle, rudders, stabilizers, and elevators, but Namco isn't bothering with flaps or de-icers or what-have-you, and you don't have to go through the motions of landing unless you really want to for some reason.   On the weapons side of thing, After Burner style, you have a remarkably capacious store of ~homing missiles,~ the aircraft of the early 21st century evidently being equipped with some kind of Tardis-esque extradimensional ammunition compartment in the fuselage. Secondary weapons are more realistically limited, but it's rare to actually run completely out of your main armaments.   Thus, it's easy enough to get on with the business of flying and breaking stuff. The mission structure is neatly curved to present some learner challenges first, stuff like ~take out these bombers flying straight and level,~ before getting on to the fun stuff, like ~destroy everything that moves in this massive port city,~ or ~take out every enemy interceptor over the three-pronged amphibious raid and eliminate ground defenses while you're at it.~ That is where the meat of the game is at, placing you in missions that feel like a real war. The scope of the battlefields and the myriad stuff placed within them is genuinely awesome at times. To fly from one end of the field to another would take a few minutes at full afterburner, and it would be impossible to take down every target, even with that portable hole of a missile rack.   Mixed even further in are some fun specialty missions, thrown in here and there to break up the rhythm (after a climactic strike mission against the Stonehenge cannon, for example, the game is kind enough to give you a quirky little milk run to wind down). One mission is an ordinary intercept, except there are electronic-warfare planes periodically clouding the radar -- you have to take those out first before you can clear out the rest of your targets.   The engines with which you may carry out that destruction are many and varied, far more so than something like Air Force Delta. The hangar of aircraft expands as you progress, with a few extra craft awarded for exceptional performance in each mission (you're graded E-S as per usual), and every plane has two to four secondary weapons to pick from, if you can afford them (which isn't too big of a stretch).    In the beginning, your ride is somewhat humble, a Vietnam-era F-4 with boring old iron bombs, but the selection rapidly expands to include MiGs, Sukhois, F-everything, and a particularly entertaining handful of ultramodern prototypes, like the forward-swept Su-37, the F-15 Active (complete with variable canards and vectored thrust), and the F-22 Raptor ATF.   Of course, these get all the really sexy backup armaments, like the FAE and the long-range cruise missiles.  Naturally, the newest are generally the best, but it's worth building an eclectic collection of planes, since some have particular strengths. The A-10 Thunderbolt is the best ground attack jet, good for close air support missions, and the F-14 is the only plane to get the utterly beautiful Phoenix air-to-air missiles -- watching its radar light up six separate targets and send missiles winging toward every one is an experience you ought to try at least once.   Perhaps the only complaint with AC4's gameplay, aside from the usual caveats about relative taste in flight simulations, is that it's over a little quick. There are about 20 missions, and the author reached the end in a relaxed three days or so on the normal difficulty level. The majority of the sorties are very replayable, though, particularly if you want to sample the full range of aircraft, and striving towards the best possible grades will earn you the best aircraft. Of course, if you don't want to bother in that regard, there's a cool ~New Game+~ sort of system that lets you restart the game with all the planes you unlocked the last time through. For you non-shut-ins, the split-screen dogfight mode is also pretty interesting, with cooperative training missions and straightforward two-player shootouts.    Graphics  Pick out a few select shots of this game and it's close to photorealistic, at least at the first glance. Look closer and you can start to pick out the seams, and it's possible to find the spots of blurry texturing and aliased edges when you're playing the game itself, but this is still a leap ahead of anything the genre has seen, on PC or console (including the lovely Naomi-powered Sega Strike Fighter).   The variety of terrain covers all the major bases, and it all looks superb. Look down on snowy mountains and it feels like flying home over the Cascades. Tree-lined hills and jungles have realistic texture. Cannonballing between skyscrapers during urban missions is an incredible rush, because you can see the lights of the city all laid out beneath you, and it's not just a flat plane with dots all over it -- the buildings and bridges are well-rendered 3D constructions, coming together to make a realistic outline. It's only when you get very close to the ground that you can see the textures start to blur, rather like taking an extreme close-up look at the cars in Gran Turismo 3. The solution?  Don't fly so damn close to the ground, it's hazardous to your health anyway.   It would be a shame to wreck such pretty aircraft, after all. Each plane is modeled and textured quite faithfully to its real-life counterparts, with the right color schemes on more distinctive aircraft (like the A-10 and some of the Sukhois). All the right bits animate, so rudders turn, elevators flap, and engine nozzles expand and contract to admit or constrict the remarkably realistic fires pouring out of the afterburners. The aircraft modeling is just as easy to admire from within the cockpit as without -- the in-cockpit view in this game is brilliant. Every plane has a well-done individually-modelled interior, and the right analog stick lets you look in any direction, just like a pilot searching the skies for a target. Thus, you can watch your missiles fly off their rails while you're actually fighting.   The cockpit view even has its own effect on gameplay, providing you're manly enough to play the game the way it ought to be. Depending on which plane you pick, it's easier or more difficult to fight from the cockpit mode -- the F-16's bubble canopy offers an almost completely unrestricted view, while something like the F-117 makes it much harder to see out. It's an unusual wrinkle, but it gradually leads to a greater attachment to the quirks of your favorite aircraft.    The wish list for Ace Combat 5, then, is short. More detail on some ground targets would be nice, since as yet they're still a trifle brown and blocky.  Also, it would be great if enemy planes actually exploded, as they do with such flair in Star Wars: Starfighter -- as it is, you can sometimes see the bogies in AC4 keep flying intact for a brief while after you see the explosion that marks their demise. And narcissistic though it may be, some options for customizing the textures on your plane, creating original logos and kill markings, would be great fun.   Sound  Ace Combat doesn't go in for the Top Gun/Iron Eagle school of high-impact rock during its dogfighting sequences -- instead, it's a mix of ambient and orchestral tracks, kind of a Brain Powerd feel if I may stretch very hard for a comparison. What impresses the most about AC4's sound design, though, is the amount of effort that's been put into the voice direction. The speech in this game is in very well-scripted and -acted English, and it adds to atmosphere and gameplay in equally impressive amounts.   As a member of Mobius Flight, you usually go into battle with four or five wingmates, and there are at least that many enemies in the field most of the time. Throw in ground targets, the occasional radio broadcast, and the voice of the AWACS aircraft that's directing your mission, and there's always somebody with something to say on the tac net. You do hear some quips more than a few times, but the commentary script is smart and the quote library is large, so it's nowhere in the realm of Smackdown or Madden when it comes to mindlessly repeating itself. Each mission has plenty of voice recorded to accompany its specific events, too. It's hard to convey how cool it is to be flying an air support mission while actually listening to the pirate radio report on the battle below you -- again, it's another part of the game's amazing sense of scale.   Story  This is a very interesting element of the game, particularly in comparison to the narrative in Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere. As you may recall, the last PlayStation AC was a sort of failed experiment in bringing a Wing Commander-style cinematic quality to the game -- you played a distinct personality, interacted with characters and plot elements, followed branching plot arcs, fell in love, and all that Mark Hamill FMV crap. It was nobly intentioned, but not very well-received in Japan, to the point that Namco completely stripped the story elements from the American release of the game.   Ace Combat 4 strikes a better balance between narrative and action, providing a break from the main thrust of the game without overwhelming it. The ~story,~ such as it is, is told in a series of comicbook-style cutscenes that run parallel to the combat missions. A series of still images, accompanied by narration, tells a tale that in the beginning doesn't seem to have anything to do with the game at all. As you work your way through the missions, though, and watch the story progress in between, your flights and the young boy's story gradually begin to run parallel and intertwine.  The ending would be criminal to give away, but it has a very neat O. Henry sort of twist to it, capping off a surprisingly effective bittersweet memoir.  Like I say, the best air combat simulation on a console.  Also very nearly the only one, but I can fairly comfortably recommend this over the Xbox's Air Force Delta, and it's a very long jump ahead of any of the PlayStation AC games.  Ace Combat 4 comes very close to doing perfectly what it sets out to do -- present an engaging, playable flight sim.  Its failings, what failings there are, stem more from differences you might have with that intention than any problems with Namco's execution.Of course, it would be nice if there were more of it, but that goes for any good game.", "date": "Oct 23, 2001"}
