Starcraft and its many antecedents, cousins, etc. are massively popular PC games, but there's never been anything like that to bring the genre to the masses on any game machine -- the issues of pacing and interface design have proven too great to overcome.  But there's always been a minority, of varying size, that will always be there to receive a good strategy game when it arrives.  They're the people who played Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the nutjobs who made it to level 99 in Final Fantasy Tactics, the die-hards who actually tried to find all the story branches in Front Mission 3.  They, I believe, will have quite a good time with Ring of Red.  Especially the Front Mission fans.  Ring of Red might not have FM3's complexity of story construction, but it tells an interesting tale nonetheless, and its spin on mecha strategy provides a satisfying mix of old and original gameplay elements.  What's more, its creators have no truck with a traditional near-future science-fiction setting.  Instead, they created a fascinating alternate history, one with a very cool design sense giving life to its people and its giant robots.  History  It's always fun when I get a game that lets me dust off the old scholarly chops.  Ring of Red belongs firmly in the venerable science-fiction subgenre of Alternate History, wherein worlds are envisioned that somehow diverged from our own at a particular point.  The game isn't as meticulously researched as a good novel, but it certainly has an interesting premise to begin from, and it builds that into an involving war story.  The branching point is the end of World War II -- in Ring of Red's world, Japan continued fighting after the atomic bombs were dropped.  This meant that the planned amphibious invasion of Japan had to occur after all, and since it took place well after the European theater had come to a close, the Soviet Union diverted enough resources to take part in the final assault.  The result is a Japan divided just like Berlin, with a tense truce between a Communist-backed government in the north and a purportedly democratic state in the South, which enjoys the support of the US and NATO.  Oh, and giant robots.  Can't forget the giant robots.  Germany was evidently working on walking mecha alongside the Go-229 and all those other fantastic super-weapons, and once the concept was widely implemented, those vehicles proved well-adapted to the difficult terrain of Japan.  With that terrain becoming a center of armed conflict, other countries and manufacturing entities get in on the act, and by the mid-sixties, we've already seen one Korea-style conflict fought with Armored Fighting Walkers.  Another is in the offing as the game begins...  Gameplay  Half of Ring of Red's combat system should be entirely familiar to players of the Front Mission games, but it's the other half that's the real kicker.  In a larger sense, battles take place on a traditional grid controlled by turn-based progression, but the individual confrontations between AFW units involve realtime combat.  This is the game's big innovation, and while it's sometimes a little slow and complex, I find it adds a whole new dimension of strategy to set Ring of Red apart.  When one unit attacks another, the scene shifts to a linear 3D battlefield.  The AFWs face each other in a straight line -- they're none of them all that maneuverable, more like self-propelled artillery with legs.  The only movement you can control is back and forth, as you attempt to pinpoint the optimum range for your mech type.  As the timer counts down to the end of your AFW's operational capacity, you control both AFW gunnery and the actions of your support troops, attempting to take out the opposing unit while preserving your own.  The dishwater-dull training missions, where you only control one AFW, give an entirely incorrect impression of what the bulk of the game is like.  They only include the simple business of gunnery, which requires only that you move back and forth to the best range you can manage, wait for your gun to load, and spend enough time aiming to get your hit percentage to a respectable level.  It's a pity you have to go through them to get to the good stuff.  It's not until three missions in or so, when you get a larger unit of mechs and support troops to assist them, that the game really gets interesting.  A complete unit consists of one AFW and three units of troops: one crewing the mech, and the other two supporting it on the ground.  Depending on the unit type, of which there are many, and each unit's special skills, of which there are even more, you can perform all kinds of different actions within the framework of a larger strategy.  Some units, for example, are effective at striking enemy AFWs, but useless against opposing infantry.  Others can decimate enemy soldiers, but their bullets just bounce off AFW armor.  Even more have special support skills that make them particularly valuable as AFW crew or rearguard troops to back up an offensive force.  Mixing and matching skills and units gives a great deal of depth to the logistical portion of the game.  Early on, you may think that support troops are relatively useless, but you have to focus on their effects over the course of a lengthy confrontation or battle -- they also become much more powerful as you acquire troops with better skill sets.  Anti-AFW troops like Shooters and Supply troops don't do much damage with each shot, but they can have a crucial effect over the course of a longer battle.  By the same token, if you ignore the enemy's troops, you can find yourself plinked to death.  Crew skills, like the HEAT and starshell shots, can make a big difference in a tight spot, and many a battle can be finished by one last grenade from your infantrymen.  The pace of realtime combat is fast enough that the game doesn't bog down.  It's not Starcraft or Total Annihilation speed, but you always have something (or things) to focus on and think about -- these aren't like the realtime cutscenes in some strategy games, which are simply there to fill time.  They aren't the entirety of the game either, though.  There are elements of strategy on the larger battle map that you have to take care of as well.  Terrain and attacking distance lend an advantage to one side or the other, which you have to keep in mind when maneuvering for an attack.  Also, certain spaces on the map can represent important objectives -- the first side to occupy a vital town or installation can acquire new support troops from that location, for example.  Graphics  For a first effort on its developer's part (this is the only PS2 game I can recall that's ever come from the KCE Studios division), Ring of Red is pretty visually impressive when it kicks into the realtime 3D combat sequences.  The mechs are nicely textured in a variety of military tones, and the infantrymen, while rather skinny and angular in spots, have a uniform look and animate pretty well in several different actions.  The framerate is perfectly smooth, even in urban areas with a lot of background detail, and while the special effects don't make a regular appearance, things like explosions, smoke, and fire are handled quite well.  Every so often, you see some pretty sweet particle effects, too, like the sparkling contrail of a shooter's Homing Shot special attack.  What I enjoy much more than the technical quality of the graphics is the style of the game, though.  It's drab, utilitarian, military -- gray and brown are the dominant colors, with a little green and blue peeking in here and there.  As far as mech design and animation goes, this is like the anti-Z.O.E.  The AFWs are clanky, stomping, slow-moving behemoths, rattling here and there as their chuggy internal combustion engines spew exhaust.  In conjunction with the sharp character art and design, they give the game a sort of mid-sixties military Patlabor 2 atmosphere, which is exactly what it ought to have -- this is supposed to be history, after all.  I'd love to see an artbook based on Ring of Red, because all kinds of interesting concepts must have bounced around in the design process.  Sound  Despite its lengthy dialogue sequences, Ring of Red has no voice acting -- a pity, because that would have lent a little more emotional effect to conversations that instead feel clipped and perfunctory.  On the other hand, maybe I should just be grateful I don't have to listen to an English dub.    The soundtrack and sound effects, at any rate, take up part of that slack during combat sequences.  The orchestral themes aren't strikingly original, but they're more inspired than the standard-issue score in the Army Men games, and occasionally you'll hear a very fine musical accent to a major battle or cinematic sequence.  The effects provide a more mundane background, but their sustained quality over the course of combat definitely gives a hand up to the somewhat slow pace of affairs.  The sound of clanking joints and rumbling engines reinforces the rough-and-ready visual design of the mechs, and there's nothing more satisfying than the explosive impact of a heavy cannon shell. The one problem that holds Ring of Red back is its translation.  This isn't as important an issue as it is in a more story- and character-driven RPG, but the game does have strong plot and character arcs holding it together, and these are hampered at times by some rather poorly-handled dialogue sequences.  The historical narrative bits that bookend each mission aren't so bad, but when the characters converse, there are often typos and spots of very unrealistic speech.Aside from that, Ring of Red is a very satisfying strategy experience.  I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who enjoyed the Front Mission series or Carnage Heart, and other wargaming fans should get a kick out of it as well, both its combat system and the involved world-building that surrounds it.  Hopefully, we'll continue to see more technically sound work come out of KCE Studios (formerly just the creators of the Muscle Ranking games), and Konami of America will do their best to develop a more uniformly high standard of quality in localization.  Pull those pieces together, and you'll have a recipe for another excellent game.", "date": "Mar 13, 2001"}
