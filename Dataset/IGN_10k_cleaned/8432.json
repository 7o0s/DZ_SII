We're using the word ~convert~ loosely in this case, of course. Nobody expected the Game Boy version to do justice to the graphics-heavy first-person shooter -- but it would have been nice if Acclaim and developer Bit Managers could have at least adhered to the storyline of the big 64-bit brother.  Features  Eight different worlds. Arsenal includes: pistol, shotgun, grenade launcher, fusion gun, mini gun, rocket launcher, particle acclerator and fusion cannon. Dinosoid and dinosaur enemies, including raptors, giant bees and even a giant Triceratops. Three difficulty levels. Password saving. Multilingual game text. Compatible with Game Boy and Game Boy Color.   The Game Forget the Primagen and his vile plans to populate the Lost Lands with his evil alien spawn -- the Game Boy ~seeds of evil~ are about a new bunch of villains, called the Amaranthine Accordance. This new phantom menace is out to restore dinosaurs to the planet and has hatched plans to send four deadly Bionosaurs through the gate between the Lost World and reality as we know it. Needless to say, Turok can't let that happen and sets out to vanquish dinosoids and dinosaurs alike and stop the prehistoric threat once and for all.  The sidescrolling action that ensues starts out on a rather confusing note. In the role of a plain-clothed Joshua Fireseed, players move through modern day streets, trying to avoid a host of dinosoids. The trouble is that the creatures have disguised themselves as humans and Joshua has to first find the ~Light Burden~ that turns him into a ~Turok~ and lets him distinguish friend from foe. As much as you want to blow away your less than intelligent opponents, you'll have to survive this boring intro without combat until you discover the coveted item.  Although developer Bit Managers tried to make the game's eight principal levels as different as possible, T2 still comes across as yet another repetitive action platformer. The N64 Turok titles are driven by intense graphical effects, startling amounts of gore and  -- most importantly -- a kicking arsenal of weapons. On the Game Boy, Turok shows itself as an E-rated cookie-cutter sidescroller with decent controls and unimpressive visuals. Sure, players will eventually have access to a wide array of weapons, but the actual differences between the guns are nowhere near as dramatic as in the N64 version, depriving the Game Boy Turok of one of the features that made its 64-bit counterparts stand out from the competition.   Visually, Turok 2 also fails to impress. Even though the first level of the game is its most colorful one, it is already evident early on that T2 wasn't really designed with the Game Boy Color in mind.  Colors are muted at all times and some of the later stages are so devoid of color that you almost feel like Turok got trapped in one of those old sepia photographs from the early 20th century. Sound and music are likewise strictly average -- Turok's jungle beats just don't seem to come across when using the Game Boy's beeps and blips. Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is a very average game all around. Whereas Acclaim's N64 dino hunter games pushed the console to its limit in the graphics and sound departments -- at times at the expense of coherent gameplay -- T2 on the Game Boy neither shines nor totally disappoints. Once you brave the boring first stage and get your hands on some weapons, T2 turns into an entertaining little game. It would have been nice if Acclaim had exercised the same kind of commitment for the handheld Turok games as for their N64 brethren. One can only imagine what the game could have turned out to be if development had actually started with an idea -- not just a name.", "date": "Jun 8, 1999"}
