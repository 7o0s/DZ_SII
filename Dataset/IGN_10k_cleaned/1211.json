Though Asterix has a relatively small following in the States, it is incredibly popular in the continent of its origin, Europe. The original series of comics, chronicling the adventures of a plucky band of Gauls as they outwit the marauding Romans, has birthed a multi-million dollar franchise of merchandise, spawning items of all shapes and sizes -- this latest addition, a side-scrolling Game Boy platformer, included. Unfortunately, the first attempt at such a game -- a black and white title released in the early nineties -- was a dull, derivative effort; and as 'Search For Dogmatix' also seems to be nothing new, you'd be forgiven for dismissing it on similar grounds. That would be a pity: this is actually one of the best platform games on the Game Boy Color of recent years.   Features Six worlds Play as either Asterix or Obelix Mini-games, which can be replayed at any time in the 'Instant Fun' mode Password Save. Only for Game Boy Color    France just isn't safe anymore, what with the loveable Dogmatix having gone missing. Assuming him kidnapped by their enemies, Asterix and Obelix -- the heroes of the piece -- begin a new adventure as they attempt to track their pooch down and pulverise any Romans they meet along the way.  While this is standard platform fare, the quality of the execution is a definite cut above the rest. Most noticeably, the graphics are generally outstanding. Not only are the characters roughly twice the size of most Game Boy sprites, they are excellently animated too, meaning that the appearances and personalities are captured perfectly: the lumbering Obelix in particular looks fantastic. The levels are incredibly varied and exquisitely portrayed, from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Each background is bold, bright, extremely colourful and detailed, with supposedly natural textures actually looking natural. This is definitely one of the prettiest games on the little Game Boy handheld yet.  The music, too, is brilliant. Unlike most games, there is an entirely original track for each of the many levels. They all suit the action perfectly, with tranquil, upbeat tunes for the more relaxed areas, and faster, more urgent rhythms in the frantic stages. You'll be amazed by how much sound -- and how great a variety -- was put onto this cartridge. It's nice to see a developer that recognises how important music is to the overall experience.  While the gameplay itself isn't marvellously innovative, this doesn't matter as much as it might, purely because it does what it does brilliantly and is tremendous fun, largely due to the smooth, fluid controls and the wonderful presentation. You always feel as though the game was planned as an Asterix title from the beginning, rather than as a derivative platformer that had the brand name stamped on at the last minute. Everything here fits the humour of the franchise perfectly, from the locations to the cartoony violence. It simply feels far more polished and professional than all but Nintendo's own.  The few innovations that offer a break from the norm are also well executed. Each of the six main worlds are presented via a map-screen, on which are shown the three main levels of the area, the boss arena, the inn -- where extra energy, hints and passwords can be bought using the coins found in the levels -- and the local mini-game. The boss cannot be fought until a key has been collected from each of the three levels, meaning that the game is never simply a matter of getting from end of the stage to the other. Similarly, obtaining the letters that are scattered around to spell either 'Asterix' or 'Obelix' unlocks the area's mini-game. These are simple in design and appearance, though some -- like the Duck Hunt-style shooting game -- are quite diverting. The ability to replay the unlocked mini-games at will in the 'Instant Fun' mode is a nice touch. One level in each world is a 'forced scroll' race, against such obstacles as a tortoise-formation of Romans and a tidal wave.  Both Asterix and Obelix are available for most stages, opening up multiple routes through each. Asterix, for example, is athletic enough to crawl through small gaps, whilst Obelix -- though his weight makes him unable to navigate obstacles such as thin branches that bridge gaps -- can bash his way through crumbling walls. The differences are hardly enough to give each character his own separate game, but it's nice to be surprised when having to replay certain stages.  It's also nice to see a platform game where the emphasis is shifted from pixel-perfect jumping. Here, there are just as many enemies to beat up as there are frustrating sequences of leaps. Rather than defeating the bad guys by jumping on their heads, Asterix and Obelix have a variety of combat moves, accessed by way of the B button. Obelix is stronger, with hits that do double the damage of Asterix's -- but his reach is limited and his pace is far slower than his friend's. This adds even more variety, giving each player the chance to pick a character that suits his or her preferred style.  There are a few minor faults. Most annoying, being killed means the loss of any keys collected:  a player defeated while searching for the third key will have to go back for the first and the second. Fortunately, the levels are mostly enjoyable enough to ensure that this isn't too much of a chore -- and, thanks to the map-screen, they can always be tackled in a different order. Having to find enough coins to buy a password is also slightly aggravating, though there are usually plenty in out of the way places. The game isn't exactly mammoth in size, either. In terms of playability alone, this easily sees off the majority of the competition. Combined with excellent graphics and sound, the game becomes one of the best in the genre. The fact that it captures the feel of the Asterix franchise perfectly is the icing on the cake. Still, it doesn't convey quite the same amount of polish or wonder as Nintendo's own platformers -- and perhaps a Zelda-esque adventure game could have captured the personality of the comic characters with even more depth. On the whole, though, this is great. Fans of the series should buy it immediately, and anyone looking for another platform-game could do far worse than take a look.", "date": "Aug 31, 2000"}
