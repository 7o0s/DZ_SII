At that time, a Russian developer figured out how to condense the entire CIA World Book of Facts in a fashion that made its numbers crunchable and its variables applicable to all nations.  This formed the basis of Bob Antonick's innovative if primitive Shadow President, which I praised in a review at the time.  Unfortunately, nobody's been able to produce a global simulation since then that is any more sophisticated or accurate.  GolemLabs' SuperPower 2 is certainly ambitious enough, but they get so much wrong that it's actually more frustrating to play than Shadow President, or its immediate successor, CyberJudas.   Starting Out  The interface initially looks sleek.  Who can resist a large, slowing turning globe in the darkness of space?  Click on a nation, and it's highlighted.  Right click, and choose one of more than a dozen ways to color the map according to political control, population density, etc.  Click on info for a bit of national information.  You can zoom in, which helps define military convoys, and does nothing else: no roads to observe, no cities to see.  But it's attractive.  Let's give it that.   Then the limitations begin to appear.  The feedback box for world events is only a single line, so items of importance from all over can rush by if you're not careful.  You can move but not resize any of the many info boxes (divided among Diplomacy, Economics and Military from the main interface) in the game, and these can end up nested four deep on your screen.  Hitting [Escape] doesn't cancel a box.  You have to click on the upper right hand corner to close it.   Several of these boxes are poorly designed.  For example, in the treaties box, you can click to select a treaty type, and see flags of all the other nations to whom your nation can apply it; but you can't drag those flags over to yours to propose that treaty on the spot.  Instead, you have to enter another, much larger screen, which entirely blankets the first, and where all the nations in the world are listed.  They're not color-coded, so if you don't remember which countries are out-of-bounds for your selected treaty proposal, you're also out of luck.  You make your choices; then you're told you used inapplicable nations, and have to start all over again.       There are almost no hotkeys, just as in the original SuperPower, and none that are customizable.  Sure, the Home key will bring you back to your country, but if you want to automate a third level economic screen without clicking on the appropriate icons to bring the first two level screens up, you're out of luck.  This goes for watching the progress of multiple conflicts, too: you have to scroll all over the globe, or attempt to jump accurately using the mini-map.  Fortunately, you can change the game speed easily, with a click in one of five speed boxes; but this is another case where developers ignored requests after an earlier release for easier access to the interface.    SuperPower 2 ships with nine scenarios.  Alternatively, you can play a freeform game.  The manual also lists a total of eleven conditional game goals you can choose from, including ~Country X controls region Y,~ ~Country X joins Treaty Y,~ and ~Country X builds nuclear weapons.~  But in fact SuperPower 2 only offers two.  What's puzzling about this is how easily the additional endings could have been implemented as game winners.  And as the manual is a PDF file, this could have quickly been changed before shipping.   Dr. Strange Wars  You can build land, sea, air and strategic military units in SuperPower 2, with design elements researched in such fields as gun range and missile precision.  It all looks nice, but why can't the Netherlands build a single air unit, despite having a range of naval class vessels at its disposal?  Multiple this along international lines, and you have a very unbalanced world whose military forces resemble nothing seen elsewhere.     When you finally go to war and fight the enemy, you move to a screen where the top part, displaying the military units spread out over both sides, doesn't represent anything save unit strength.  The actual placement of the units themselves appears below as blips on a radar.  Their placement in relation to the enemy appears to be completely arbitrary, so that you may have most of your force facing one unit in an enemy convoy, or all of theirs facing one of yours, at any given time.  Your controls are minimal, and the results dispiriting.   The art of international war itself is conducted here according to principles that would make Sun Tzu burn his book and restart life as a caterer.  I've experienced several games where nothing happens for years; and then suddenly, someone invades Bukina Faso, and everybody goes to war with everybody else, for no conceivable reason.  Or consider Iran: I get that in the current international political climate it could become embroiled in an international war.  (It has, after all, in the recent past.)  I played Iran in SuperPower 2, and predictably it's current government is viewed as a pariah regime by quite a few other nations.  What I don't understand is why, at one point, after I'd increased the size of my military, Spain declared war on me.  That's right: Spain, and nobody else.  The Spanish actually invaded my territory, leading to the expected solidarity that led several other Middle Eastern nations, including Afghanistan, Jordan, and Syria, to back me up.  The last time I played that unbelievable scenario of mine, the Spanish had taken over the northwestern quadrant of my nation, and my allies were swarming them from all sides.   In another game, as Brazil, war was declared on me by Taiwan and Saudi Arabia.  Nobody else made a move, either against me or for me.  No reasons were apparent why my relations with these two nations suddenly took a nose dive from the 50% range down to subterranean levels.      As of these strange declarations of war weren't enough, any navy can bypass all the seaborne defenses you can muster by sea or air, and bombard coastal areas, escort subs, or land troops.  Is Peru angry at the US?  Does it wish to annex New Orleans?  Nothing simpler!  Peru declares its intention to grab territory (yes, this is a diplomatic treaty); and no matter how many battleships the US amasses in the nearby gulf, Peru will be able to sail straight them all, landing its entire army on the gumbo-drenched shores of Louisiana.  Talk about a game breaker.   Another curiosity is the cavalier, offhand manner in which nuclear war is treated.  ~When a region is the target of a successful nuclear attack, the Infrastructure level is reduced,~ the manual tells us, but it neglects to point out that in real life the affected region is literally uninhabitable for generations, with plant and animal life unable to achieve any kind of stable, functioning biological paradigm.  Despite being a self-proclaimed geopolitical simulation, nuclear payloads in SuperPower 2 are simply treated as larger conventional bombs.  If you want alternatives that will still make you the bad boy of the world, try another game.  There are no biological or chemical weapons available in the title.   Voodoo Economics  That was the way George Bush Sr. described Reagan's economic plans, when the two were running against one another in the 1980 Republican primaries.  Whether or not it was genuinely applicable isn't the point.  I'm using it to refer to the very strange ways that numbers act in SuperPower 2.   Ostensibly, there are many options available.  You can customize expenses in your national budget along ten areas, and potentially control some aspects of four additional fixed expenses (security, diplomacy, trade, units upkeep).  You set tax rates, and encourage or discourage the development of any of twenty-seven national ~resources~ (grouped under food and agriculture, energy, raw materials, industrial materials, finished goods, and services).  But you can't offer any true real world incentives to resource development, except cutting back taxes.  And you can switch between private and public management of any resource in the twinkling of an eye, without any of the massive national and international fallout that this move would normally make.     What's more problematic, the economic changes you implement don't always do anything, or seem to do something other than expected, whatever the immediate budget numbers may say.  For example, in one game I managed to boost taxes and cut spending efficiently enough to reduce my national debt by $350 million per week.  This went on for eight months; then, for no apparent reason, the process reversed, and I began losing as much as I'd previously gained, month after month.  I'd changed nothing, so I saved the game and did some printout comparisons of my national economy and all its figures, before and after this reversal.  There were no differences, either on the local or world stages.  I was simply losing money as quickly as I'd made it, for reasons that were clearly mystical and beyond my mundane comprehension.   In another game where I was playing Venezuela, my national debt suddenly halved from roughly $13 billion to $7 billion, literally within a day.  There was again no apparent reason for this.  I went back and replayed the same sequence twice; each time, it happened once more.  No other nation had bailed me out financially.  In fact, they can't, unless you approach them first.  Nor had I changed anything that could cause this.  There was nothing I could see that might produce such a result.   It's not just lack of realism that plagues this game; it's lack of sound logic.  The PDF manual tells us that you can make an economic sector like drugs illegal, and that this hurts production and consumption.  Yet as research has shown, the black markets in Communist countries back in the Soviet era flourished precisely because the creation and distribution of private goods was illegal; and as much can be said for liquor during the Prohibition Years of the US.  This is mirrored today by a number of countries where the cultivation of plants associated with the creation of leisure drugs are nominally illegal, but remain the #1 cash crop both for quantity and price.  If anything, making an economic sector illegal should increase demand, hence consumption, unless a large amount of money is made available to interfere with sector development, delivery, and demand.  That GolemLabs arbitrarily redefines economic results in this fashion makes their game all the less of a true simulation.   Diplomacy  If a game's developers claim it's a global simulation of the way nations relate to one another, you would expect an unusually rich, effective and realistic assortment of diplomatic options.  There are seventeen possible treaties you can approach other countries with in SuperPower 2, but the omissions are as striking as the inclusions.  This is a so-called global simulation that doesn't allow the sharing of intelligence, for instance.  It supports alliances, but not defense treaties; the trading of weapons between nations, but not the analysis of those weapons you've purchased, so that you can continue to make them, yourself.  You can establish a treaty to move military forces over another nation, but there's no treaty allowing you to build bases on a friendly nation's soil and stop there.  You can invade someone else, but there's no peace treaty.  Wars simplystop.   In addition, SuperPower 2 includes one of the most bizarre diplomatic options I've ever encountered: the ability to Request a War Declaration.  You can suggest that hostilities start between two other countries; then they both agree to it, and go to war.  If this appears to you to bear more resemblance to a tennis match than the real world, you're not alone in that perception.  In one game, as Canada, I made a RWD for the US and Iraq.  The fact that Iraq agreed to this was strange enough; the idea that the US was politely waiting for somebody else to suggest this as sufficient reason for invasion is mind-boggling.    While you can send covert operatives into other nations or use them to protect your own, there's no option to stage a phony covert op in your own backyard, and blame it on a neighbor (thereby acquiring an apparently legitimate cause for war).  You can't offer any support to rebels in another nation, whether financial, military, or diplomatic (allowing them to operate offices in your home turf; beaming radio propaganda at their countrymen).  You can't bug foreign embassies on your soil, nor can you run sting operations to discredit other regimes.     GolemLabs says that the UN declined to allow its name to be used in their game, and they thought it didn't seem right to create a similar organization using another name.  Let's take a moment to see if anybody is actually convinced by an argument of such staggering implausibility.  Why couldn't they have called it the League of Nations, in honor of the proto-UN which failed due to lack of US support in the early twentieth century?  Or the Spartan League?  Or the Consortium of Purple People Eaters?  The name doesn't matter.  The point is, if you're running diplomacy and economics in a global simulation and pride yourself on the accuracy of your data (as GolemLabs says it does), then some kind of UN-like body is as essential as checkered trousers on a used car salesman.  You can't simulate realworld diplomacy (or, for that matter, international economics) without some kind of UN-style game element.   Poor Feedback  There's no question that some of the unfathomable activities of your fellow governments in SuperPower 2 are due to poor feedback, and they strongly contribute to player frustration.  You're never given the reasons why they do whatever they do; you're only provided with the results.  If Poland declares war on Zambia without any partners, then there must be a reason for this.  It probably isn't a good reason, not for most of the oddball conflicts that erupt in game session after game session.  Still, it would have been useful to understand the logic behind a nation-driven AI deciding to invade someone halfway around the world.  It might have made your fellow governments feel a little more like the real thing.  Nor is this impossible: natural language computation has been part of the Chessmaster series for years on a more complex level than anything SuperPower 2 would have needed.  But it's always possible that, given the bizarre behavior of nations here, GolemLabs didn't want the reasons for their actions known.  They might have further reinforced the belief that the game's AI is impossibly primitive.     The lack of feedback bites on your home turf, too.  On one occasion I was into my second year playing Venezuela.  I had a 74% approval rating, was lowering the national debt, increasing funding to education and cutting down on corruption.  In SuperPower 2, that kind of approval is considered very, very good.  Then, suddenly, a coup d'etat occurred.  I was simply informed of that fact on one short line, and a dialog box appeared telling me that I'd lost the game.  My frustration level at that point involved talking to the screen in language that would curdle code.  It was all too eerily reminiscent of those early adventure games from the mid 1970s, where you walked at random through one of several identical doors and were told it had been a bad choice; you were dead.  Come on, Golem Labs, your players deserve better than this.  So does their blood pressure.   Sometimes, the problem isn't lack of feedback, so much as feedback that's plainly bad.  For example, one of the treaties you can make is called a Cultural Exchange.  It's intended to ~improve diplomatic relations between members.~  Yet I've never seen a Cultural Exchange treaty have any effect whatsoever.  I finally decided on an experiment.  I played three countries whose relations with the US were very different: the UK, Gambia, and Cuba.  Each managed to make four successful Cultural Exchange treaties with the US.  (Yes, you can make them in quick succession between the same pair of nations, which is equally strange.)  Then I checked the chart that showed how my current nation was regarded by the US.  In each case, there was no change to the diplomatic relations, either in the short-term or long-term: weeks, even months later.  This is just one example of a problem that occurs repeatedly in SuperPower 2: mystery game controls that appear to do nothing, or do other than is claimed.   The graphs, like the graphics, are also more for show than use.  Consider the bar graph representing your nation's budget, divided into ten areas.  But as Brazil, your Infrastructure spending can range from 0 to $27 billion, while Propaganda goes from 0 to $11 billion, and Environment, from 0 to $38 billion.  This makes the bar graph totally useless as a measurement of comparative expenditure, since the bars don't measure the same amount; and they raise the question, who's determining what the expense limits are for each category?  But waittry another nation.  I did: Canada.  There, the Infrastructure bar went from 0 to $15 billion, Propaganda from 0 to $6.5 billion, and Environment from 0 to $21 billion.  Why are these numbers different from those for Brazil?  And why can't adjust the ceilings as I prefer?I had high hopes for SuperPower 2.  The manual reads well, and it appears at first glance as though the developers included a lot of gameplay in their ambitious title.  But much that was important in a global simulation has been left out; and much thats included is bug-ridden, inactive, confusing or unbalanced.  It almost makes the US presidential election seem like fun.  Almost.", "date": "Nov 3, 2004"}
