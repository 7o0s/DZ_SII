The graphics were tight, the voice acting was, for the most part, right on the mark, but overall it was far from a well-rounded gaming experience, and blocks away from the gentle neighborhood of Fun Terrace. Coffin Rock, the second game in the series from developer Human Head, is definitely not confused. It's rushed, it's un-tuned, and it's buggy enough to have you staring blank-faced at the fact that this is a finished product. Worst of all, it doesn't come close to delivering the experience you expect from a horror game -- which is especially sad given that this game's out in time for Halloween. Why so chunky? Read on.  Each of the three games is covering a different aspect of the Blair Witch myth mentioned in the original film, spreading each part out into it's own unique story. Rustin Parr covered the killer who murdered the seven children, and now Coffin Rock takes you to the Civil War days to unravel the mystery of the ritualistic murders of a search party on eerie Coffin Rock. You play as a Civil War soldier nicknamed Lazarus (you've lost your memory, and metaphorically risen from the dead), who's out to find Robin Weaver, a girl who goes missing in the Burkittsville woods after you make a visit to her farmhouse after being found lost in the forest. The game actually takes place in two parts, one in the current timeframe, and another as a series of playable flashbacks that help to explain just how you ended up in the woods in the first place. Seems as though you were sent with a group of soldiers to capture rebels who have been stealing food and uprooting train tracks... only something went wrong along the way. Horribly wrong. Want to make a guess as to whether it has anything to do with the evil forces in the woods?  Gameplay wise, Coffin Rock plays out a little different than the first game (and it's cousin Nocturne, for that matter). While Rustin Parr killed you with mazes and annoying puzzles, Coffin Rock is as straightforward as it comes. So straightforward, in fact, that you'll be wondering if your only job in the game is to activate the next cutscene. The first few hours of gameplay seem more like watching polygons chat than actually taking part in a game, but once you get deeper into the woods, you'll get a pretty good dose of action. In fact, Coffin Rock is definitely more action than adventure -- so action, in fact, that it's got the dubious honor of being one of the first games where you can kill ghost with bullets. Darn ghosts. Never liked having to go through an Exorcist, anyway.  The same control setup is intact, with your direction controlled by the mouse, and walking controlled by the keyboard. Unfortunately, you don't have the quickturn button available to you in the first BW game, which means that you'll have to do some quick mouse swiping to get at monsters behind you. Fortunately, to make up for it, Human Head seems to have made the strafe control on your character much more quick and useful than in other games of this type. You'll be able to move away while firing pretty simply, taking away a lot of the frustration.  Speaking of frustration, that's just the thing with Coffin Rock. While there are some stressful moments in the game, overall you'll be able to kill enemies with complete ease. A couple of shots will take out most foes, and the small variety of monsters (ghosts, stick-figure beasts, and demon type dogs) are either too dumb to run at you until you get close, or too slow to pose a threat. The first boss I fought in the game took about two tries to figure out the trick to beating it -- after that, it literally took about 15 seconds to slay it. In a way it's a nice change from the cheap shots thrown at you in the first game, but this other end of the spectrum has its own problems. Without the adventure elements or tense thrills of Rustin Parr, there's really nothing here to grab you. Running down a trail, killing a few monsters, and heading to the next cutscene only keeps you for a few hours until you start wondering when the real meat of the game's going to start. Unfortunately, it never does. Even as a budget title, you should hope to expect some sort of replayability or underlying gameplay to keep you going, but Coffin Rock relies on the story hooks and gimmicks to push you to the next area, scene, or boss... and after a while, it just doesn't deliver.  Coffin Rock also suffers from middle child syndrome in the graphics and sound department. Terminal Reality, makers of Rustin Parr, also developed the engine -- so the graphics were razor sharp, even if the gameplay wasn't. Coffin Rock comes off more like your traditional budget title. Backgrounds are filled with simplified texture sets (check out Bess Weaver's house if you want to check out a good example), character animations are stiff, and the dynamic shadows that make the Nocturne engine so great are almost nonexistent here. The sound suffers the same consequences with lackluster voice acting, minimal music and sound effects, and odd sound glitches that make for silent chunks of the game, or sections of dialogue that are mysteriously absent It reeks of last-minute syndrome, comes off clumsier than Jan putting on an afro wig to fit in more at school.   So Coffin Rock is another disappointment, but are you so surprised?  The game is as straightforward as it comes. You run in, talk to some people, find a path to run down, and kill everything in your way. The gameplay isn't deep enough to keep you interested, and the story and adventure elements are too B movie to scare you into wanting to find out where it all ends up in the end. While Rustin Parr did a good job of setting mood, Coffin Rock feels more like Plan 9 From Outer Space than a homage to one of the most popular horror films of recent date. Maybe the third time will be the charm, but so far the BW series of games looks about as intriguing as Freaky Links.  Here it is Halloween, and we've got no Alice to play, and no Blair Witch horror to hide from. Looks like I'll have to watch old Hollywood Square episodes on the Game Show network if I want any serious chills this holiday.   -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
