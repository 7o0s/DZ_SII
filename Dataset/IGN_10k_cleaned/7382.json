However, play any number of the French mobile maker's titles, and you can appreciate why Sony slacked off the hubris and sought the outside help -- Gameloft is the superior game maker. Kudos to Sony for such foresight, and congrats to Gameloft for crafting an enjoyable romp reminiscent of the 16-bit glory days of platforming. Open Season is not the deepest game you can download -- not by a long shot -- but it's breezy fun that treats the source material with care and respect.   As Boog the bear and Elliot the deer, players run through four locations based on the motion picture, including Beavers' Dam and Timberline forest. These colorful characters -- both figuratively and literally -- have a collection of classic platforming moves at their disposal, such as high jumps and hiding behind objects in the field for simple stealth tactics. Boog and Elliot show no love for rabbits in their adventure. Bunnies are used as projectiles once scared stiff with a great sound, such as Boog's roar. You can throw these mini mammals into enemies or at environmental features.   Wan more genre staples? The pair hunts Woo Hoo chocolate bars to earn extra lives. Teddy bears refill depleted health. There are barrels to jump in and get fired off into the wild blue yonder. There's even a mine cart rollercoaster. But the degree of familiarity does not breed contempt, as the action is properly aligned with the source material. What did you want, after all? Boog Kart Racing? No, you expect a day-glo platformer with traditional mechanics -- and that's what Gameloft delivers. This isn't going to challenge you, but it doesn't disappoint you either.   Open Season looks great -- it was tested on an LG handset on Verizon. The sprites are large, the backdrops are colorful and detailed. The animation is smooth. Open Season is a quality production.Open Season does little to advance the ball -- instead, Gameloft focused on creating a solid platformer complete with tried-and-true mechanics and respectful use of the license. Admittedly, I have not seen Open Season, but I have seen the trailer more often than I ever care to and the visuals definitely match up. If you have a younger player in the house, Open Season is a good download for idle time. But fans of the old 16-bit formula will also find some pleasure here, too.", "date": "Oct 17, 2006"}
