Yes, the good folks of Wausau, Wisconsin cleared a parking lot, dumped a bunch of asphalt in it and deemed it safe for skating. The centerpiece of this community service project (designed, of course, to keep all those crazy skaters in the same place for easy round-up) was a huge megadon half-pipe made of the roughest concrete known to man.   One sultry August day I decided to ride the beast. Yeah, I had visions of Ray Barbee and Christian Hosoi dancing in my head. My cousin and I rode down to the park, the warm August wind on our faces. By the time we had arrived, I had my deck designs, clothing line and video deals all worked out. I was going to be the next Tony Hawk.  I stepped from the car, my new Lance Mountain board (pink grip tape, Crossbones, don't ask) clutched, white-knuckled in a sweaty palm as I strode to the almighty concrete god. I mounted the pipe, preparing to drop in. I am going to be the next Tony Hawk. I am going to be the next Tony Hawk. I am going to be the next Tony Hawk. I don't need protective gear.  I tipped my board forward into the abyss, eternal fame hanging in the balance, and... the board shot from under my feet and I skid down the length of the half-pipe on my bare knees. Oooh. Blood. Never mind. Success doesn't come easily. I went up for another run. Same result. An hour later, my knees looked like a couple of slices of bloody deli ham. I never completed a single trick and subsequently stuck to street the rest of my pathetic skating career. Thus ended my dream, until... Tony Hawk Pro Skater came out. This game let me live the dream in a concrete-free environment. Hell, on a cushiony couch. Sure, I got the game for my Playstation. And you know what? It was the best Playstation game I had ever played. Hands down. Now it's out on the Dreamcast, courtesy of Neversoft, Treyarch and Crave and has gotten even better. If you want the short version of this review, here it is: Buy this game. Buy it now. Do not hurt anyone on the way to the store, but get there as soon as possible. If you can find a better way to spend fifty dollars (on a dollars per hours of enjoyment ratio), I'll show you my disbelieving face. That's my solemn guarantee.  Now for the long version. I must warn you, I am given a bit too gushing when talking about this game. Forgive me. In fact, I could barely sit still long enough to write this. After all, the game is just sitting there one foot to my left. Just a minute.  Sorry. I'm back. I just had to turn the game on for a second. Just a second. I wanted to see if the great graphics were still there. I mean, I had to scour every level and check out all of the skaters again. Guess what? They still rock hard.  Let me start with the environments. Of course every single surface of this game is ridable, grindable, trickable. There is really no background, per se. It is all playable. The thought put into the environments is unbelievable. Practically every surface, every last pipe and ledge is reachable. As you get better and better, you'll be able to get to more places in every level.  The textures everywhere are beautifully detailed--even up close. No more polygon smears. Every single itty-bitty pool tile is accounted for. The eyeball pool in Burnside is eerily realistic. Rock looks like rock, concrete looks like it would rip you to shreds to bail on--and does. It is also deep, deep, deep. There is no fog to speak of. Like the cinematic masterpiece Citizen Kane (this game's motion picture counterpart), every single shot is set to deep focus and delivers. Everything in the frame is crisp as a fresh-picked apple.  How do the skaters interact with these complex, rich courses? I have one hyphenated word for you: near-perfect-integration. Tony and Co. glide, grind and coast over ramps, ride walls and bail hard from serious heights. For the most part, there is a slick synthesis of rider and ridden. Once in awhile, there is a collision problem, where a head or arm will get lost in a wall during a bail, but that's about it. While actually pulling off tricks, the environment is tough as nails. Don't believe me? Try ollying underneath a concrete ledge and see how you fare.  The skaters themselves look amazing as well. There are ten skaters represented in all (plus two fun ones to unlock). They are: Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Kareem Campbell, Rune Glifberg, Bucky Lasek, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas. Each wears his/her own signature gear and has several decks that can be unlocked as you work your way through the Career Mode, collecting tapes as you complete challenges.  Each character design is perfectly at home in the environment of THPS. Even the special characters, Officer Dick and Private Carrera look great tricking up and down the courses. When you pull off a Varial, it is easily distinguished from a Fingerflip. The fluidity of each motion has been honed to the max. This game is silky smooth. Silky smooth (repeated for dramatic effect).  The crispness that this machine offers allows you to see every tweak, every bone-out, every twist animated perfectly. The camera provides a dramatic but unobtrusive view of the proceedings. In fact, all of these details are so great that you barely notice them. When you're playing this game, you aren't thinking ~This is an impressive frame rate.~ You're thinking, ~Damn, how am I going to land this 720 Switch Method over the Bridge Gap and grind the coping on the way down?~ Tony Hawk Pro Skater is all about the tricks. Each skater starts with a resume of signature maneuvers. You use these to trick over, grind on and generally shred every course in this game. All of the old favorites are there: the Kickflip, Nollie, Sex Change, Madonna, Method, Japan Air. Pulling them off in succession is the key to high points and prestige among your friends. After a particularly lucky run last night, my roommate turned to me and said, ~For a moment there, I thought I was watching Jesus Christ on a skateboard.~  This is the kind of thing I'm after in a game: watching one of my friends shred up a course, hand me the controller and have me take a shot. Isn't this what video games are about? Doritos, Mountain Dew, late nights and trash talk? There is a smug and irresistible urge to slag on your buds as they bail, and pat them on the back when they finally get that Secret Tape on the Downhill Course.  The gameplay allows for this. You watch the demo and say, ~I will never be able to grind like that.~ But the fact of the matter is that you'll be tearing up the game in no time. This said, it is enjoyable the second you pick it up. The controls are easy to learn and the object is simple. Get points. During the Career Mode, you'll also have tape challenges to complete, but the main idea is skate hard and have fun.  In fact, I defy you not to have fun playing this game. Everything, from the sick trick combos you can pull off, to the thrill of competing against your buddies, to the pounding soundtrack make you smile from ear to ear.   Let's talk about the soundtrack. Normally, I go for the options screen a couple days after getting a game. But this one never gets old. Tracks from Black Flag, Dead Kennedys and Primus fill out a driving line up. The sound effects of the game are also top-notch. When you bail, you can almost hear a guy's guts rearrange. The slick metal slide of board on coping is amazing, as is the whirring noise of wheels on wood. I'd like to meet the foley artists who got these sounds and kiss them sloppily.  There are so many reasons to buy this game I can't list them all here. Extra options such as full saveable replays are just gravy on an already yummy pile of mashed potatoes. Bottom line, I do believe this is the best Dreamcast game yet made.  And it's saved me a leg or two, as well.  -- Chris Carle, Poseur", "date": "May 25, 2000"}
