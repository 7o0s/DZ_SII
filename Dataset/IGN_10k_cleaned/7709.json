Let's face it, when working with a complex menu-based interface, you really need a mouse. A joypad just isn't going to cut it.SimCity 2000 suffers from this malady, but ultimately it's worth it. You take the role of mayor of a town, and get to run every aspect of it. You have to attract prospective citizens, keep them happy by zoning areas for residences, commerce, and industry, and any and all things you'd find in a city. There's also natural disasters to contend with. You even have to repel an alien invasion.It's not the best management sim available, but if you liked A Train or the original SimCity, SimCity 2000 won't disappoint.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
