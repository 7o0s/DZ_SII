Though Eidos has given us some solid PC games (namely Thief) and a good console title here and there (namely Sword of Beserk and Legacy of Kain), their tired attempts of Tomb Raider sequels, as well as quite a number of third-rate titles, have made them a favorite target among video game reviewers.  However, in comes Urban Chaos a good 3D action game ported from the PC onto the Dreamcast, and Eidos Interactive has a chance to break their chains of current mediocrity.  And honestly, even though every Eidos game I have reviewed in the past well-deserved the few good and many bad rating, I really wanted to give the Dreamcast version of Urban Chaos high marks, especially since it seemed like the only problem in the PC version was the keyboard control scheme that action games on PC's commonly encounter (you can feel this review turning already, huh?).  Sadly, the cool concepts and huge maps don't erase the mistakes of choppy frame rate, annoying control problems, and lukewarm visuals.   Taking place December of 1999, you play D'arci Stern, a promising rookie cop in Union City (though in later levels, you will get to play the vigilante Roper).  Union City has seen an escalating amount of crime in the past weeks, and soon you learn of a plot that not only seeks to control the whole city in a grip of vileness, but the whole world.  Yeah... same ~not just saving the whole city, but the whole world~ plot line that we've played before.  As you go through the city, you'll be able to speak with the citizens of the city, some of who will be courteous, others that will tell you to ~&*@%~ off.  Though most of the citizens don't have any speech, the voice acting for those characters that have speech is excellent.  What's even better is the freedom to do whatcha like.   Take Grand Theft Auto, put the visuals in 3D and do a role reversal of criminal to cop, and that's the idea behind Urban Chaos.  Sure, you have to uphold the law but they didn't say exactly how.  This gives you the freedom to use ~any force necessary~.  Oh, there's that mugger... why don't I just knock him unconscious with a baseball bat?  Hey, there are those drug dealers on the corner! I better run them over with my car before I arrest them!  And yes, accidents will happen so you can harm innocent citizens and you get a chewing out when this happens.  Like the felony system of real life, kill non-criminals three times and you're out.  However, it seems you can arrest anyone without having the game end and it's especially gratifying to arrest a citizen that told you to ~Get out of my way, &!%@#~.  And beyond the freedom of arresting anyone (well, except cops), you also have the Southwest policy of movement throughout the city  the freedom to roam.   In a huge city like Union City, the fastest way to get from point A to point B isn't always by car, as being on foot has its advantages.  Certain building can be climbed and once on the roof, there is a rather simple ~roof highway~ that you can use not only to get places, but scope out certain ~red zone~ areas of crime.  But if you don't feel like humping it to a certain area, you can always commandeer vehicles.  Unfortunately, no one in this city is going to give up their car without a fight, and some drivers will even run you over!  Thus, in order to seize a vehicle for police pursuit, you need a gun in order to fire a warning shot in the air.  Though the act of requisitioning a vehicle is limited because of the small amount of ammunition available, it's the cool concepts included in this game that made it initially promising.   However, I can't promise you that the frame rate won't make some gamers, who prone to motion sickness, queasy.  Though not as bad as the PlayStation version, the frame rate in the Dreamcast version of Urban Chaos is truly disappointing and it can affect gameplay, since there are some jumps and activities that are hard to time due to the choppy frame rate.  Another problem is the lack of a strafing or side-stepping; while there is a side-roll feature that enables you to dodge enemy attacks, a side-step feature would be much better, especially since there are some platforming sequences reminiscent of Tomb Raider.  Camera problems do affect the game from time-to-time, mostly in tight quarter areas where the camera sometimes has a hard time deciding exactly where it wants to be.  Fortunately there is a view button that positions the camera back in the default location.  Problem is, you will have a hard time realigning the camera during combat situations.   The combat in this game reminds me of another Eidos title - Fighting Force.  A rather cool improvement over FF is when you're in ~combat mode~ you can engage multiple opponents at the same time without having to ~lock on~ to them.  But with this feature, you're limited to the number of attacks to use, and most of the time, it's best to grapple them to the ground where you can immediately arrest them.  Combat gets pretty boring very quickly, especially since enemies don't seem to attack you if you're arresting another criminal - Final Fight this is not.  Thankfully, the missions do keep the excitement level somewhat warm.  The mission system is particularly good; as you start out on the mission, you'll be called in to backup an officer, chase down robbers, and other side quests that naturally happen being a cop.  Thing is, you don't have to answer these calls, since all you have to do to complete a level is to finish the given assignment at the beginning of the level.  Of course, you'll miss out on power-ups and bonus points if you choose not to pick up other calls.  Urban Chaos came out for the PC last December, and while it's expected that the graphics in the Dreamcast version will be somewhat dated, it's far and away anything from top notch.  Plagued by a poor frame rate and camera problems, field of view is pretty small; it's easy to make a turn and collide with an object you didn't see, because there's no way to see it!  The character models are very first-generation... for a PlayStation system.  And the simple textures on these blocky models don't make it easier to swallow.  And the bad frame rate also does a number on the animation; it's especially noticeable when driving a squad car.  As you're driving your squad car, it will often be pulled forward by some unseen force, then it'll shift back to its normal frame of movement.  It feels as if they rushed the conversion for the Dreamcast because it hardly looks Dreamcast worthy at all.  Urban Chaos is a disappointment, not because it was expected to be better, but it had so much going for it in gameplay and innovation, only too fall short because of control and visual weaknesses.  I have no problem with recommending a game that has dated visuals as long as the gameplay is worth it.  Sadly, I have to bring down the hammer again on another Eidos title due to the somewhat unreliable controls, lackluster visuals, and horrible frame rate.  Maybe Eidos will make a sequel to Urban Chaos for the Dreamcast that will alleviate these flaws... then again, let's not cast the die, considering how much we love Eidos sequels.   --Anthony ~Not An Eidos-hater~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Oct 28, 2000"}
