The company started its GBA publishing with a spot-on recreation of Chu-Chu Rocket, but quickly realized that it would be more beneficial to partner with a publisher to get its developed titles on US shelves. Though THQ's brand was prominent on several of Sega's in-house developed titles (including Puyo Pop, Baseball Advance, Pinball of the Dead, and, of course Sonic Advance, the die-hard gamer knew exactly which company was really responsible for the games. Sega Rally marks Sega's return to publishing on Nintendo's handheld. But with the company's track record on the GBA, it's a bit shocking to discover that Sega Rally doesn't quite reach the same mark that other big-name Sega titles have reached on the GBA. The game admittedly features an amazing presentation with all sorts of unlockables to discover and enable, but the main gameplay and graphic design just can't compare to other racing titles on the handheld. Features Unlockable cars, tracks, and gameplay modes Hidden extras including Sega Rally History and Art Gallery Tradeable ghost racers Internet ranking via passwords Cartridge save (one player slot) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance Sega Rally attempts to recreate the same racing experience the series has offered in the past in the arcade, as well as on the Dreamcast and Sega Saturn. The development team poured a lot of what the series gave gamers in its previous incarnations, including several off-road and pavement track designs through different locations, lots of different licensed vehicles from manufactures such as Toyota, Lancia, Peugeot, Ford, and Subaru, and multiplayer support, but this time with as many as four players through the use of the link cable. The GBA version goes several steps further than the original designs by offering several unlockables that can be earned by collecting coins; the better the performance in a race, the more coins earned. The more coins earned, the more that can be unlocked and saved to cartridge.   Unfortunately, the core racing engine isn't exactly up to snuff with what's already been done on the Game Boy Advance. The programmer or programmers attempt to offer a fully 3D environment in this portable version, but the result of their work is a very pixelated, muddied 3D engine. It's a standard compromise on the Game Boy Advance where the developers plaster sprite vehicles and objects over a 3D world, but the actual 3D engine in this game features horribly low-resolution textures that glitch out more times than they should. The terrain rises and falls with the flowing geometric hills, but objects can be seen through the hills; this seems to be a common occurrence in 3D engines on the GBA, as the same problem happens in V-Rally 3...though V-Rally 3's 3D engine is far more impressive than what Sega's GBA team put together.   And while I could spend the rest of the game harping on the graphics engine, that's not fair to the entire package, as even a crappy looking racing game can actually play very well; just look at Colin McRae 2.0 on the GBA. And while the gameplay isn't terrible, steering the vehicles in Sega Rally more feels like you're rotating the terrain around the car instead of moving the car within the terrain. And it's a good thing the game offers both visual and audio cues of when specific turns are coming up, because in several places the pixelated graphics engine makes it extremely difficult to see the curves as they approach. Despite all the weird handling and graphic quirks, the racing is admittedly very challenging; it's not an easy feat coming in first during the championship levels, especially if you haven't spent the necessary coin to unlock the more capable vehicles hidden in the game.  But even though the main racing isn't quite up there with the rest of the GBA pack, Sega makes up for it in extras, and the development team offers a whole lot of stuff to encourage folks to play Sega Rally. The game features an excellent time trial mode that records a ghost racer for each available track, which can also be sent to a friend's copy of Sega Rally through the use of a link cable. The best time in each area also has a password attached to it, which can be entered into Sega's Sega Rally website. All the coins that are earned in the championship modes can be used to purchase turns in a simple but fun coin-collecting mini-game, or access to some historical images of past Sega Rally paraphernalia.. The only thing that's really missing is the Sega standard of offering a small ~taste~ of multiplayer Sega Rally in a multi-boot single cartridge mode; the multiplayer features all require a copy of the game for each system that wants to join in the network.  As far as racing engines go, this one can't compete with the likes of Colin McRae 2.0, GT Advance 2: Rally Racing or even V-Rally 3 on the Game Boy Advance. But even though the main racing is lacking, the development team made the package palatable by including a ton of extras, including Internet ranking, collectable mini-games, tracks, vehicles, and historical Sega Rally images. So, while there are plenty of better looking and handling racing titles on the GBA, at least Sega Rally makes up for its design shortcomings in mass amounts of features.", "date": "Mar 11, 2003"}
