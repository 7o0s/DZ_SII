{"name": "Virtua Tennis", "name_review": "Virtua Tennis", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/21/virtua-tennis", "text": "When Sega's internal development team Hitmaker created Virtua Tennis for the Dreamcast and arcade a couple years ago, that team pretty much set the standard for all videogame tennis games. Yes, it was arcade-style tennis, but it looked fantastic and it gave players so much shot control...even though the game's configuration was a simple two-button affair. THQ obviously felt that the series could be done justice on the Game Boy Advance, so it set a GBA team to work on a portable rendition. The result is a game that might not have the technical prowess of the original, but the gameplay is fully intact with additional elements that makes this handheld sports title an incredibly deep and challenging tennis game that's a heck of a lot of fun to play for hours at a time.  Features 14 different players Create-a-player, male and female Three different court surfaces Eight different mini-games Singles and doubles challenges Link cable support for up to four players (multiple cartridges needed) Only for Game Boy Advance  Even though the Game Boy Advance title is called Virtua Tennis, the ~virtua~ part is pretty much non-existent. Developers have certainly proven that the Game Boy Advance can handle limited 3D polygons in a 2D environment, but Altron went with a full-on 2D graphic design for this tennis port. It's not exactly a great looking game, since sprite characters run around the well-drawn arenas in very limited, clunky animation, with harsh edges drawn around their borders.   But graphic design aside, Altron's rendition of the Sega Sports title is outstanding in gameplay. The developer obviously worked with the original Dreamcast team to get the feel of the game right on the Game Boy Advance. It does take a few games to understand how much control they have over their shots, and the D-pad is a poor substitution for the Dreamcast's analog controller...but after a few sessions on the court, these control will become second nature. The simple, two button configuration offers top spin and slice shots (with lobs activated by both buttons together), and players can control the direction and placement of the shots with the directional pad during the swing. Like the Dreamcast game, players can begin their swing at pretty much any time as long as they're within the ball's area...by holding down the button, they can more easily aim their shot with the extra time. The downside, of course, is that the shot's power is reduced...making it a little easier for the opponent to return it. Of course, the game also features doubles challenges along with the one-on-one gameplay, and the computer AI partners in these modes are relatively intelligent in action. Players can even alter the AI partners' strategies by hitting the L or R button to cycle through the different techniques.  Players can either jump right in and play a few tournaments or exhibition matches, but the real game is found in Virtua Tennis' world tour. Here, players create both a male and female counterpart, building their skills and abilities by advancing through the World Tour's structure. To wean players into the complexities of the game's controls, the GBA version brings over the Dreamcast's mini-game idea. Some of the eight mini-games are conversions of the Dreamcast versions, but some are actually unique to the GBA title. These games not only train the players, but they also level up the players' custom characters upon their creation. Each mini-game has its own required tactic to master. In the Burger Chef level, players must aim their serves at a four-by-four grid, with each square supplying a different ingredient for the giant burger that the chef will create. Disc Shooter is a game of Reversi/Othello, where players must aim the return shot at a five-by-five grid of black tiles, flipping them to the reverse color when the tile's hit. Tank Attack trains the player in power shots by pounding return shots at a moving army tank. Bull's Eye is another game of return-shot aim, with players trying their darndest to hit the center paint on the other side of the court. Each of the games are a lot of fun to play, and it wouldn't be surprising to see players tool around in them even after they've gone as far as they can in that game's specific difficulty level.  The game's structure is amazingly deep, thanks to the inclusion of the cartridge save. Players can create and name a male and female player and alter specific elements of their looks and abilities. The game keeps track of each of the players' attributes, including  power, speed, control, and stamina, as well as the level of serve, volley, smashes, and lobs. And even though it may seem minor on the surface, Virtua Tennis even has a clever collection screen where players can earn and display 128 different items after completing specific tasks. These tasks can be as simple as winning a specific tournament, to completing a mini-game only using one specific shot. Some of these elements are just brag trophies, while others actually enhance your characters abilities. And you never know what items will unlock and when...it's up to you to discover how to earn these little icons. The only thing this cartridge save doesn't keep track of, disappointingly, is each player's win/loss record. Virtua Tennis also features link play for as many as four systems in the network, and the game performs excellently in this mode.  It's just a little disappointing to discover that there's no single-cartridge multiplayer...for each player that wants to join in, they'll need their own copy of the game. There's not a whole lot of Virtua here, folks...but the tennis part is fantastic. Virtua Tennis is, by far, the finest tennis title on the Game Boy Advance to date. It may not be a pretty rendition of the Dreamcast series, but it plays so well it's easy to forgive the somewhat clumsy character animation. And even though the sprites may not move nearly as fluid as their polygonal, console counterparts, the ball physics and motions are rendered extremely well on the GBA. And without those, tennis games wouldn't have a leg to stand on. I also love the collection aspect that Altron included in the GBA version of the series...it's very similar in concept to EA Sports' popular ~cards~ element, where each item is acquired by performing certain tasks in the game. It's very ~Pokemon~ in design, but it adds so much to the presentation and lasting play.", "date": "Oct 21, 2002"}
