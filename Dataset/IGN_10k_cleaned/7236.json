The classic arcade shooter, Space Harrier, is one of SEGA's most beloved titles, and courtesy of SEGA Mobile, has been shrunken down to fit the smallest screen. Gamers that have treasured memories of Space Harrier, whether you played it in the arcade, bought the 3D Glasses attachment for the special Maser System edition, or found the Genesis sequel under the tree in 1990, are advised to think long and hard before potentially sullying their cherished moments. Space Harrier for mobile is not very good.   After getting over the amusement of seeing an entire arcade cabinet transmogrified into an itty-bitty cell phone, fans must come to terms with the lacking game play. The tighter corridor, the inaccurate controls, and the messy enemy patterns all torpedo that chance of this being worth a download for the sake of nostalgia. Even with the auto-fire option, which ensures a steady stream of death ovals pour forth from your gun, targeting even the most basic pattern-following enemies is a pain. How odd for the bullets to arc upward so severely, for example. This may be an attempt to create a feeling of depth as hero flies through a psuedo-3D environment, but it just throws off your entire game.   Most frustrating, though, is watching shots go right through enemies. That's just impossible to get around, and had me closing my phone a few times out of disappointment. A flaw as bad as that cannot be overcome.   As mentioned, the game does look pretty good, and it does feature decent renditions of the classic musical themes. The Space Harrier universe is an inventive one, full of Maori heads, mushrooms, dragons, and big robots -- but seeing all of this represented so well just doubles the impact of the bad mobile mechanics.  Bringing Space Harrier to mobile is noble, but the controls and botched mechanics just don't do the classic justice. Hardcore fans of the Yu Suzuki's arcade classic may be tempted to download it, but your download dollars will only support future miscalculated ports. Hopefully, when mobile gets a grip on technology, such as adequate controls, SEGA Mobile will revisit this favorite.", "date": "Sep 14, 2006"}
