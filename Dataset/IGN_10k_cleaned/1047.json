Rugged beasts, the four-wheeled metallic monsters are manufactured to drive comfortably under any surface conditions found in the great wide open.  Like rally racers, these bad boys would appear to be perfect fodder for an ~Extreme~ video game, but our friends at Head Games got beaten to the punch.  Technically, this wouldn't be a bad thing, except for one small detail.  Encore Software, the crew that edged them out, has pooped out the leading candidate for ~Worst Racing Game of the Year.~  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you utter drek.  Early on, it's easy to see that troubles are forthcoming.  The game and I got off to a rocky start as soon as I hit the driver customization screen.  On arrival, the game informed me that although I could choose a picture to represent my character, change their name, and pick a color for my ATV, only two vehicles were available, neither of which handled differently from the other.  Call me crazy, but I can't fathom in this day and age why anyone would bother to include vehicle variations of any sort that affected play solely on a cosmetic level.  It's inane, mucho stupido, and effectively eliminates any incentive the player has to unlock the game's six hidden ATVs.  Grumbling away, I proceeded to enter the belly of the beast.  Taken at face value, the play options look robust and intriguing.  Five race modes can be chosen, including rally, derby, treasure hunt, finders/keepers, and circuit.  A rally is a single match against an adjustable number of computer opponents on terrain chosen by the player in which drivers compete to pass through checkpoints as quickly as possible.  Derbies are timed bouts, as players jostle for control of the greatest number of gates and steal possession rights from one another on a regular basis.  In treasure hunt mode, you're given three minutes to recover as many diamonds (75 in total) as you can, with finders/keepers being a variation that includes multiple drivers.  Circuit races occur in a sequence and demand high placement in each race before advancement takes place and hidden ATVs are unlocked.  What should be pure bliss becomes an affront to common decency once you're behind the wheel.  Never before have I encountered such an awkward or pointless driving model.  ATVs drive at Mach 5 speeds and cruise over the landscape like a harrier jet, causing the terrain to fly by in their wake.  The feeling of floatation is so bad that it's a shock when the vehicles hug the ground after a jump, getting zero hangtime when you were counting on seeing them float off into space like a UFO.  Crashing headfirst into a crate, boulder, or the things that try to pass themselves off as trees brings your vehicle to a standstill.  We should all be so lucky to have these ~60 to 0 in one second~ brakes -- the number of yearly auto accidents would plummet.  Sumptuous graphics wouldn't mask Kawasaki ATV Powersports' glaring problems, but they would have been a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down.  But that's not how life works, and the title's visual feast is in reality as sumptuous as a half-eaten can of Spam with a pack of saltines on the side.  Universally, the tracks on display (salt flats, desert, meadow, strip mine, badlands, island) bite the big one, with almost no scenery to take in.  That's a mixed blessing in this case, because all objects ranging from cranes, scrub brush, and huts to diamonds and mountains of salt look worse than Pickle Boy after a Goldschlager sponsored all-nighter.  Textures and shapes are primitive, suffer from tacky color schemes, and can't hack it to save their lives in software more or Direct 3D.  Around fifty courses are set up and ready to go after installation, but as a cruel joke, Encore has also lumped a course editor in for the hell of it.  This tool supposedly allows the user to build and develop their own tracks and is billed as ~easy to use.~  In practice, we find that it is of course easy as pie to manipulate, since all you're able to do is assign waypoints and save the map to disk.  Wowee zowee, that's deep.  Unlimited replay value, here we come...somebody hold me back! [Editor's Note: In case you couldn't tell, Scott was being sarcastic.] [Scott's Note: Duh Tal. Duh.]  Keep holding me, would you, since I'm liable to get medieval on Encore's ass.  Kawasaki ATV Powersports is a blatant move to use a respectable license to mask a piece of crapware.  Load up the program and shake the box as you will, the game is devoid of substance and recommendable features.  Legend has it that somewhere in the desert, millions of ET Atari 2600 cartridges lie buried, worthless to the world at large.  If one of you Indiana Jones types happens to stumble on it, please drop the IGN staff a line immediately. Heaven willing, we've got a new deposit to make at that landfill.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jun 23, 2000"}
