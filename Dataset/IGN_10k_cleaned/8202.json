Playing Bungee Desperado is like stepping into a time warp to 2003, when mobile gaming was still in its real infancy and the decks were bursting with pretty much anything the carriers could get their hands on. Quality control was in a trough, but without any real benchmark for what was possible on the ever-evolving platform, carriers threw everything against a wall to see what would stick. Last year, mobile saw the biggest quality spike in its history as carriers exercised some pretty hard controls over what made it to the decks.   Honestly, I really didn't think I'd see a game as pointless and boring as Bungee Desperado ever again.   I was wrong. Thanks, Cingular. And thank you, Tequila Mobile.   In this, um, game, you are the so-called Bungee Desperado. With a huge bungee cord strapped to your ankles, you leap off cliffs from the back of your burro and steer through canyons full of cacti, buzzards, and longhorn skulls. Like Johnny Crash, but worse, you earn points for slamming into these obstacles. However, each crash takes health away from the desperado, so you must constantly refill it by bouncing into -- wait for it -- bottles of tequila. Before slamming into the ground, you must pull the cord taught. If you satisfy the mission objective, such as a point total or a rescue, you move on to the next jump.   The game functions, and that's about the best I can say. Pushing the buttons does indeed move the desperado. Touching tequila bottles registers on your health meter. Hitting buzzards result in score increases. But at no point whatsoever is this game engaging or fun. The game play is dull. The visuals are lackluster. Mobile gaming has grown significantly in the last two years, leaving no rightful place on the decks for this relic.  Bungee Desperado is a terrible game that should have never made it to the decks. This might have been passable during the days when we were wowed by a mobile game just being in color. I recognize that Tequila Mobile intended just to make a silly game. But silly and compelling are not exclusive concepts.", "date": "Mar 13, 2007"}
