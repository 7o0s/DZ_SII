The company's latest outing is NHL 2000, a portable rendition of the biggest hockey series in videogames. The Game Boy system isn't exactly the powerhouse platform to do the series justice, as apparent in this port  the game just doesn't flow as smooth as ice. Features Six Game Modes  45 teams (NHL, International) Offensive and defensive strategies, line-changes 1998-1999 Statistics of the NHL players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   To bring the series to the Game Boy system, Tiertex took the existing Genesis NHL 95 series and shrunk it down for handheld play. This is the five-on-five hockey title that we were playing on the 16-bit more than half a decade ago (and if you look at the goal creases, you can see that the developer of the Game Boy version didn't bother to lop off the corners).  In design, it's really close to the Genesis version, and even adds some of the features that are in the current modes. The game start interface is very similar to the PlayStation model, for example, but the rest of the game is modeled after the 2D rendition. The portable version even has line editing and line changes during play so you can balance your players around to bring up the strongest force during certain plays. Obviously the biggest handicap is the Game Boy's two button configuration over the three button layout of the Genesis version, but even with one less button the portable edition controls quite well.  The game flows as smooth as expected for a hybrid Game Boy/Game Boy Color game, but in some places players will vanish for a frame or two when they group in certain parts of the rink. The Game Boy does have a sprite management problem, so keeping track of ten independent sprites at one time is a pretty daunting task for the little handheld. There's little to no sound during the game, other than the white noise of the crowd after a slapshot, or the tick of the puck leaving your stick.  The main gripe about NHL 2000 is the horrible player AI. After playing one game, you'll want to turn the ~offsides~ option off  your offensemen only seem to realize that they're not supposed to be offsides AFTER they've crossed the line. Right after a faceoff all four of your teammates will blast out of the circle and head across the blue line as if they're supposed to do that  wrong. There are other odd quirks with the way the defensivemen set themselves up during offensive plays, but it's the way offense reacts to your puckhandling that makes the game a chore to play. I've also experienced a cheating goalie, keeping the puck for longer than he's allowed, simply by hanging onto it, dropping it, picking it up again, dropping it again...until the teammates set themselves up for the offensive play.  The game also has a Playoff mode, but one look at the extensive 20+ character password and you'll learn that the hassle of saving your place in the roster just isn't worth it.  I'm a huge video hockey fan, having played the NHL series since its original inception on the Genesis nearly 10 years ago. The Game Boy version is a nice try, but the odd quirks on the AI make the game a bit of a pain to play. Thankfully you can turn off the offsides option, but that makes cherrypicking the net a whole lot easier. I just have to wonder, how much better would the game have been if it was programmed specifically for the Game Boy Color?", "date": "Jan 29, 2000"}
