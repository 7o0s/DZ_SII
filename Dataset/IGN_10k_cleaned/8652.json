This week, that game is Wiffle Ball, developed by Skyworks Technologies, a game that is broken and ugly in just about every way imaginable. The game attempts to recapture the magic of tossing a Wiffle Ball around the backyard with friends as a kid, but will really just inspire frustrated gamers to toss their DS against a wall. Make no mistake by that familiar logo on the packaging - Wiffle Ball for the DS is a total bastardization of the classic ballgame, with some of the sloppiest programming and game art ever to be released. Parents, kids, gamers: beware.    To begin with what's wrong with this game (get ready for a long read), the rules of this rendition make no sense. There are 2 outs per inning and a game lasts through the 7th inning. Both teams share the same outfielder. If a ball hits the ground and is grabbed by the pitcher or outfielder, even after several bounces, it's still an automatic out. There are no bases or running, so if a ball lands on the field and by some miracle isn't grabbed, the batter gets a virtual base or two. The batter has no adjustable swing (other than moving closer to or further from the plate) so anytime a ball is thrown low in the strike zone, it's impossible to hit and an automatic strike against the player. The perspective is so bad that it's impossible to tell when a ball is actually crossing the plate and when it's time to swing. This should have been remedied by top screen display; in addition to the behind-the-batter view on the bottom screen, the top screen features a bird's-eye-view of the action. Unfortunately, the batter and plate aren't shown on the top screen at all, in spite of their location being clearly visible, so there really is no way to tell when to swing the bat other than relying on blind luck. They could've also remedied this game-killing problem by including a shadow on the ground underneath the ball, but that's probably too logical an idea for a game as ambitiously stupid as this one.    Pitching doesn't work any better. Although the player can select from five different pitch types, and vary their pitching speed with a slider, the physics of the ball are so wonky and unrealistic-looking that functionally every pitch yields the same result; a curve ball will bend outward a good 4 feet, then miraculously spin back in for a perfect strike. Quick, somebody sign this whiz kid pitcher up for the majors! Batter AI is easy to exploit since they'll swing at just about anything, so tossing balls well below the strike zone will usually strike them out on missed swings before they have a chance to be walked. When the AI batter actually hits a ball, the player is able to control a slow-moving outfielder, who is unable to take the infield in spite of the pitcher in front of him doing absolutely nothing. This results in lots of cheap bases scored on the player. When a ball does make it to the outfield, it usually lands in a place the outfielder can't reach, like on a balcony, in a tree or in a swimming pool. Since these obstacles are located in the field, this also results in plenty of cheap bases. I don't mean to sound condescending, but what kind of idiot kids play wiffle ball next to a swimming pool?    In all modes, instead of playing against a purely computer-controlled opponent, the player initiates both the pitching and the batting, using the same button. The player must hold down the A button for about 3 seconds (any less and it doesn't register) to pitch to their batter, then release the A button at the right moment to swing. Why the player is forced to partially control both characters at once instead of the AI pitching is beyond me, because it makes the game even more unplayable. Players can also pitch by holding down the stylus (again, for 3 seconds), although switching from stylus back to A button mid-pitch makes the experience even worse. Accidentally tapping the A button mid-swing causes a batter's swing to restart. Factoring that in with the horrible camera and dual-team multi-tasking, getting a hit is nothing short of a miracle.       There are three basic modes to the game. In Quick-Play, players hop right into a game of wiffle ball without navigating any additional menus or options. This mode is meant to be the quick, pick-up-and-play mode of the game. The second mode is the same as the first, with a few extra menus. Season Mode puts players through a full season of games, playing against 7 other generic, unmemorable kids. Nothing is accomplished or earned through this mode, though, other than the sense of peace at no longer having to play through it. Finally a multiplayer mode is available that, not to be upstaged by all other crappiness in this game, offers no single-cart download play. With two copies of the game and 2 DS systems, players can double their frustration by struggling to play through this horrible game with a friend.    Menus are hideous and all interface art looks like it was done in Photoshop in about five minutes. There are frequent graphical errors and pieces of art with nasty edging, as if they'd been blended to a white background and then put on a black one instead. None of the art has been cleaned up so everything has a blurry, mushy look to it. Of course the art direction is so bad, maybe it's best to see as little detail in it as possible.    Batters and pitchers are handled through pre-rendered 3D animations, so even though these characters look incredibly generic, they move pretty smoothly while pitching and batting. Animations of running and fielding fares worse, with glitchy sprites wigging out as they slide around on the top screen, and the pitcher doing what looks like the MC Hammer dance every time he feels like attempting to catch a grounder. Music is not only awful, it's made up entirely of 5-second loops that play over and over and over. There are almost no sound effects in this game, and instead of looping properly, all ambient sounds pop in and out as if a bus full of noisy kids keeps driving by. This game is awful. Laughably, inarguably, inexcusably awful and I cant believe it was let through DSIs gates, let alone Nintendos. Wiffle Ball for the DS is an abomination of gaming that should have never seen store shelves. Every step of its execution is a failure, even the simplest things like button responsiveness. DSI has made a living for years now barfing out shovelware like this, but this game isnt just bad because of a low budget and short development schedule  there are seriously poor design decisions made here. The art isnt just ugly, its done incorrectly. The coding is inept, which is shocking because almost nothing happens in this game. Everyone involved in this games creation needs to reexamine why theyre in this industry, because Ive never come across a handheld game as offensively bad as this one.", "date": "Jun 18, 2007"}
