The Lost Vikings kicked off the Blizzard Classic Arcade series on the GBA, followed  by the excellent handheld version of Rock 'n Roll Racing a few months later. Capping off this brand is Blackthorne for the GBA, an adventure game that's almost exactly like a gritty, violent version of Prince of Persia. Like the past two titles from Blizzard, the conversion of Blackthorne is spot-on and fun port of the Super NES design that hit the market almost ten years ago, but it's somewhat unoriginal and finite game design doesn't make it quite as classic. Features Training level Cartridge save (six slots)  The backstory of Blackthorne is so extensive that it literally takes up half the game's manual. All you really need to know is this: you're a pissed-off guy with an affection for shotguns, returning to a planet that's been overrun by evil aliens enslaving your race. The task: free your world by defeating the enemy Sarlac. But first, you'll need to find him...and that's where your abilities will come in handy.  Blackthorne is, essentially, Prince of Persia with a boomstick. There isn't much original in the way of gameplay since a lot of what  players do in the game is patterned off the Prince of Persia design. The levels have the same familiar feel that involve running, jumping, ledge-climbing, or tripping pressure-sensitive triggers. Players work their way through the levels, flipping switches, attacking enemies, and discussing strategies with prisoners scattered throughout the areas. If players losetheir health trying to get through a particularly nasty level challenge, it's back to the last checkpoint saved to cartridge.  The uniqueness of Blackthorne comes in the form of weapon use; instead of swordfighting, players can pull out their shotgun and blast enemies from clear across the other side of the screen. The game features a defensive move where Blackthorne can sidestep into the background to avoid getting blasted himself. Throughout the levels, players will also pick up power-ups that'll replenish health lost after taking a particularly nasty fall or taking a blast to the chest or back from an enemy. There are also explosives to grab and utilize, from a bomb that can be lobbed from a distance, to a ~hornet~ device that can be detonated anywhere the player can maneuver the little thing.  Of course, the coolest element: the violence. Players can take out prisoner allies, either by accident or on purpose, without any punishing effects. In fact, it's almost encouraged to put a bullet in the slaves' brains thanks to the obnoxious noises coming from their equipment...one shot will shut them up. It's just part of the game, and it admittedly adds a sort of ~cool~ flair since you're playing a character with little to no remorse. It's a rarely seen role on the Game Boy system, and it's a wonder how Blackthorne managed to get out there without the Mature rating on the label.  This Game Boy Advance version was handled by Mass Media, the same development studio that handled the GBA ports of the other two Blizzard games. The conversion is just as well-produced as their previous two ports, with the team adding a cartridge save that replaces the original game's password system. The team also had to map a few controls differently on the GBA's button-layout, as well as add the ability to manually scroll the screen up and down due to the portable's lesser resolution cropping the viewing area. The one big downside to the conversion is the oversaturation of colors on the GBA screen; the SNES original was admittedly a dark game whose graphics wouldn't have looked very vivid on the  LCD screen. The bump up in colors on the GBA noticeably washes out the detail of the well-drawn character sprites and level background...and it's something that becomes even more prominent when playing the title on the Game Boy Player peripheral. As fun and challenging as the game is, Blackthorne is a finite design that's much shorter than Blizzard's previous two games. Once players make it through the adventure, there's nothing more waiting for them. Blackthorne definitely offers welcome gaming nostalgia on the handheld, but games like Ubi Soft's Splinter Cell have advanced this game style much further on the GBA.", "date": "Sep 24, 2003"}
