{"name": "Catz", "name_review": "Catz Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/16/catz-review-2", "text": "Thanks to the assumed chilly, calculated nature of a cat, it's been posited that the more congenial and responsive dog is the only logical focal point for a pet simulator. Gameloft knows otherwise. The only people that claim cats don't have the warmth of personality and desire to please as a dog are those that either never owned one, or just didn't pay much attention to theirs. Cats are devious, inventive animals with a shrewd intelligence that may not dovetail nicely with the human personality like a dog, but they are incredibly complex. Your cat is not aloof just to be a jerk, for example. Your cat is aloof because it wants you to put out some effort before it rewards you with its affections.   Catz, the follow-up to Gameloft's Nintendogs-esque Dogz, may at first look like a marketing maneuver, but if you dive into the game and put out the effort to raise this virtual feline, you'll see that the firm has seemingly placed much more thought into the title. Your mobile kitty is a fuzzball capable of such endearment you now have to wonder where Nintencats is, after all.   At the start of the game, you check out a litter of kitties -- each with their own personality quirks. It's a tender mercy from Gameloft, as anybody with a cat knows that the cat you picked out from the adoption fund is often not the cat you get at home. Some cats are more playful, others more demanding of attention. None of these cats are the same -- again, something which any real cat owner can tell you. I have four cats myself and each animal has a wildly different personality.   When you take the cat home, you're funneled into a pleasant tutorial that teaches the basics of feeding, play time, and other daily duties. You'll learn about the accrual of funds, which must be spent on goodies for your cat or else the cat will get upset. (You wouldn't like kitty when he's upset...) But right away, Gameloft hooks you making your cat such a love-bug you can barely think straight. The cat rushes the screen, shoving its furry mug into yours and smiling when you tickle its chin or pat its head. The game also gives the hint that the cat would appreciate it if you left its ears alone. Sound advice, Gameloft, and some of us have the scratches to prove it.   The cat runs around the house, darting under the couch or leaping on the bed. On the bed, the cat rolls back and forth, letting you know how happy it is to feel 300-count sheets in your loving home. Kitty is almost always doing something cute, such as tugging on yarn or hiding in the attic (a mini-game), so there's a near-constant visual reward for just checking into the game every day.   The world of Catz extends beyond the living room. You can explore the backyard, check out the neighborhood, visit the pet shop, and even enter your kitty in competitions. The last part -- cat tournaments -- is total fiction, but it's a solid game mechanic. Cats have a mind of their own, and while you may be able to teach them a couple small patterns, there is no way in hell you could get a real cat to run an obstacle course unless you have the patience of Job. And falconer's gloves.   One of the best parts to Catz requires effort, but it's worth the time invested: You can raise a second cat once you prove to the game you are a capable pet owner. Warning -- two cuddly cats rolling around together might cause a cute overload that burns a hole in the screen.   Gameloft has done an excellent job making Catz an attractive game for cat fanciers. Your house is full of things the cat will interact with, such as the television or a mouse hole. Your kitty is alive with wonderful animations. My only real complaint about the production values is the digital meow -- it's not even close.  Cat lovers will get a real kick out of Catz, which is almost too cute for its own good. Seeing the kitties jump on top of the bookcase to nap, duck through the obstacle course tunnels, and roll around the bed is guaranteed to make you smile. The game doesn't re-write the rules of the pet sim genre, so if you are looking for new ground, Catz may disappoint.Catz may not have the depth of My Dog's mood system, but it is extremely accessible -- and that's worth quite a bit, too. If you dig on cats, this is well worth your time and download dollars. Although, make sure you don't play it to the exclusion of your real cat. Because those monsters know how to punish.", "date": "May 16, 2007"}
