With Defender, Scramble and Galaga already out, it seems that there wouldn't be room for another coin-op shooter from the early '80s to be released unless it is of the exceptional variety. Gyruss is not exceptional. While it may have done some things that were technically impressive in 1983, game design has come a long way since then and Gyruss simply doesn't hold up. Add in the fact that this port isn't even as good as the original arcade version and you have little reason to give this title more than a passing glance.   Gyruss falls into the thinly populated genre of tube shooters. These titles created a pseudo-3D look by allowing the player to move in a ring while perspective was toyed with to give the impression of moving into the screen in an extended tube shape. It may look slightly different, but the actual gameplay ends up being similar to more traditional shooters like the aforementioned Galaga.     Being a game from the early '80s, there isn't a whole lot to Gyruss. Your main attackers are ships which can kill you by ramming into your craft or hitting you with a bullet. Other enemies make brief appearances including meteors, satellites, and a second type of craft that guards the single power-up. Grab the bonus power-up and you get a double shot, necessary for scoring the highest amount of points during the intermittent bonus rounds.    What made Gyruss popular in the arcades of yesterday seem trite by today's standards. For starters, the game provided a goal, something few old school arcade shooters had. In this case, it's to reach Earth by moving through successive waves of attackers and making your way through the solar system. Each wave has attacking patterns of ships that get increasingly difficult as more are spilled on-screen and bullets began to blanket the board. The attack patterns remain the same in this arcade port, though the game feels a bit dumbed down with less shots coming your way. This may be a good thing since it's harder to navigate the ship around the ring with the analog stick or d-pad than it is with a joystick.   The other thing Gyruss had going for it was the sound. Being the first arcade title to support stereo audio, it took full advantage of the new tech with a pumping techno remix of a Bach tune. This remix has been remixed once again for the Xbox 360 and it's a nice tribute. However, turning the sound to the classic option to relive the exact notes of yesteryear is a bit of a disappointment. Something went wrong in the emulation and the original Gyruss soundtrack sounds muddled and is missing the fire it once had.   Like the sound, the graphics have also been enhanced to take advantage of the more powerful hardware. Don't expect anything amazing here. Very little was done aside from adding a little oomph to the explosions and smoothing out the sprites so they don't look so jaggy. All told, the enhanced graphics don't look much different from the original. That isn't the most disappointing thing you'll find on the screen, though. Digital Eclipse once again failed to take advantage of the fact that developers have the option to move the Xbox 360 alerts to a different part of the screen than the bottom middle. If you get an achievement, game invite, or have a friend pop online, you'll find the alert will cover up your ship if you're playing in the bottom middle of the screen as most of us tend to default back to. This is seriously annoying.    So most of the port of this ho-hum game was bungled, but it isn't all bad. Online and offline multiplayer modes were added. Like other arcade games, there are options for versus games and co-operatively play. Now, the co-op play still isn't really co-op since you just play side by side and have your scores added together, but at least it runs smoothly. The versus game is a bit more fun and the two screens side by side make it so one doesn't have to look at the drab borders around the game which is always a good thing. Unfortunately, the offline multiplayer mode requires two controllers but can't be played side by side. You'll have to trade off turns for that one. Why? Well, there isn't a good reason why.   If you played and loved Gyruss back in the day, you'll find that the gameplay here is mostly intact and the trip down memory lane may be worth your 400 Microsoft points ($5 USD). If you aren't a Gyruss fan, there are plenty of better shooters on the Xbox Live Arcade to spend your points on. Even the 200 Achievement Points shouldn't be a good excuse to buy the game as they are far from easy to snag. With gameplay that has just grown more stale over the past 20 years, this one can be given a pass.", "date": "Apr 20, 2007"}
