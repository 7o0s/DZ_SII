{"name": "Outlaw Volleyball: Red Hot", "name_review": "Outlaw Volleyball Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/11/outlaw-volleyball-review", "text": "Simon & Schuster Interactive, with development help from Hypnotix, have gone ahead and made a worthwhile franchise out of their ~Outlaw~ series of over-the-top sports games. Last year, Outlaw Golf grabbed many a dollar from weekend duffers who could appreciate the lighter side of the game through OG's twisted humor. Now with Outlaw Volleyball we all get to see how well the formula applies to volleyball. Just like it's golf predecessor, OV brings a solid, not spectacular volleyball gameplay engine and jams it together with a ton of personality and humor designed to make the whole thing a guilty but irreverent pleasure. The addition of head to head play over Xbox Live is a huge bonus and meshes nicely with all of the game's offline components. It doesn't have the same aesthetic value as Tecmo's DOAX Beach Volleyball but OV might be the most functional volleyball title out there on any system.   Gameplay  The sport of volleyball itself, thankfully, doesn't require too much in the way of fancy controls and mechanics when it comes to a videogame so Outlaw Volleyball keeps things simple and straight forward. The A button is used to bump and set when the ball is on your side of the net and you aim the bump or set once your player is in position to make the play on the ball. The X and B buttons are your specialized return shots that you will have to master if you want to be successful in competitive play, whether online or off. You can take the easy way out and use A to get the ball over the net but you'll be missing out on all of the strategy you get with the spike (X) and dink (B). The Y button is your block button and that move is all about timing. The intuitive controls system trains you to hold a face button while you're playing the ball on a bump or set so when it comes time to spike it or to deliver a vicious serve you'll be ready to hold the X button down while your ~quality meter~ rises. Your character has attributes the determine power but you're in control of the accuracy and effectiveness of your spike by releasing the spike button when your quality meter is full. If you max it out perfectly, you're going to deliver a vicious shot. Holding the right trigger adds a little of your character's momentum energy to the shot. If you have enough energy, your spike will be a flaming comet of a shot that'll be extremely difficult to return.   Outlaw Volleyball FAQ Want to biggie your boobies?

Get The FAQ | Get Codes  You build momentum energy by consistently making great plays and winning points or by spending those good old Beatdown Tokens that made Outlaw Golf such a hoot. In OV, you can spend a token and pick a fight with either one of your opponents and bet your momentum against theirs. The winner takes all and a losing team can quickly have the juice they need to deliver a couple of vicious kills to get back on the winning track.   The control system in Outlaw Volleyball is effective and you'll have it down after only a handful of games. The problem is, however, that you really will have it down after a few games and the depth of control and intricacies of the game don't change much beyond this. Because of this, the difference between victory and defeat, whether you're playing against the CPU or against offline and online buddies, won't always come down the more creative or skilled player. Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of the characters involved in the match becomes more important than anything. While exploiting your character's strengths and your opponent's weakness is definitely a skill, it's doesn't always feel like you have as much control as you should in Outlaw Volleyball.   In addition to standard exhibition games and the Tour mode where you unlock all of the characters, clothes and courts in the game, you get to build up available characters in the game's Drills mode. These minigames build up your individual volleyball skills like aiming your spikes, precision bumping and setting and whatnot. Clearing individual minigames gives you a couple handfuls of attribute points that can be spent in any of your characters' four skill areas: power, speed, offense and defense. The minigames are a ton of fun and will improve both your skills and your character's abilities at the same time. Very satisfying.       Online play is very well done and feels 100% fluid and natural like you're playing against a buddy sitting right next to you. You'll notice we said ~a~ buddy and not some buddies because OV is only peer-to-peer, your Xbox against another somewhere out there on the network. Fortunately the nature of volleyball videogames with the top-down view makes a four player game --two players per Xbox-- nice and enjoyable. There's no downloadable content to speak of just yet but expect plenty of new clothing items and other goodies at some point down the road.    Graphics  If DOAX was the Pamela Anderson of videogames then Outlaw Volleyball is surely the Jennifer Lopez. If you thought Cameron Diaz loved her ass in ~Charlie's Angels,~ she doesn't have anything on the developers at Hypnotix as evidenced by the high cheeknology in Outlaw Volleyball. The female character models are very well drawn animated and ~fleshed out~ whether they're supposed to be masculine ex-KGB agents or hard-drinking motorcycle chicks. Xbox quality bump-mapping and lighting is put to outstanding use to bring the thong choking rear-ends of OV's characters to life like never before.   The male characters look alright too, I guess. Who knows?  The top-down perspective allows for constant wide shots of the rich and detailed gameplay environments like the Ice Box in Antarctica or the Big House prison court.  There are animated spectators and well-drawn objects like submarines and satellite dishes.   The mo-capped animation works very well in bringing out the characters' personalities and most of the game's humor. Ex-KGB agent Natasha would look like Dolph Lundgren with boobs if she didn't go through her hilarious Vodka shot or judge-assassination routines to show just how nutty she really is. All of the characters have multiple positive and negative reactions to play on the court that really do the job even if they do get repetitive very quickly.   And you don't want to miss little details like Leon's custom gear by Bubu (not Fubu) or Natasha's Bear Gym t-shirt. We know new shirts and outfits will be among the downloadable bits of content and we can't wait to see what comes next.   Sound  The voice acting is well done and this includes the game announcer played by Outlaw Golf veteran Steve Carell. The visuals are funny in Outlaw Volleyball but the jokes come flying with a quickness from the disembodied voice of the match's announcer. The first time you hear his jokes you'll have to give up a few good laughs and really his lines only end up being as repetitive as John Madden's lines in any one of his football videogames. The point is he keeps the energy going and is a key part of the game's humorous intentions.   The characters don't say too much but they all have a line or two they spit during their pre-game intros and during their post-play reactions. The Russian, southern and Spanish accents are all believable without being insulting to those communities like you might expect in an over-the-top game like this.   The music of Outlaw Volleyball is a mixed bag of rock and hip hop and you'll even get a CD with the game that features three tracks from OV's official band, Diffuser. Le Chic's Nile Rodges executive produced the game's soundtrack so you'll be able to pick up that full length CD if you're already or if you happen to become a fan of Waterdown, Junk or Hot Rod Circuit. The music itself wasn't our cup of tea but the fact that it's original certainly counts for something.  Dolby Digital surround sound would've worked nicely with this game by bringing out cheering crowds that surround the court and whatnot, but apparently it just wasn't meant to be. Outlaw Volleyball is a straight forward volleyball title that does exactly what it set out to do by providing humor and full online play. As a sports title it's easy to pick up and play and a little too easy to master for my tastes. Actually, the same can be said for the humorous, entertainment aspects of the game. However when you add up the single player career mode, character-building minigames and Xbox Live play and downloads you're getting a lot of volleyball bang for your buck. It's a completely different experience than DOAX and ends up being a decent volleyball and Xbox Live game that fills a need this time of year.", "date": "Jul 11, 2003"}
