Regardless, THQ and Nick Games have teamed up to bring this boy with the overpowered brain to consoles in the form of a platform adventure.    Features:   High tech vehicles and gadgets to aid Jimmy on his mission such as the Pulse Light Ray, Gust Buster Fan, Grappling Hook, Neutron Duplicator, Magnetic Tuner, Jimmy Bot, and Trajectory   Goddard power ups that give Jimmy access to a shield, go-kart, watercraft, and the ~play dead~ bomb   16 levels that span over 5 worlds   Interact with all your favorite Jimmy Neutron characters like Jimmy Neutron, Carl, Sheen, Cindy, and Nick   Original voices from the cartoon show  Jimmy Neutron has always had a penchant for building overly complex inventions to solve miniscule problems -- even if his inventions always back fire in one way or another. Then again, what else is a lad with an over sized brain supposed to do? In Jimmy Neutron: Jet Fusion, Jimmy's going to have to put all that brain power to good use in order to save the world as he knows it.    How'd the world fall into chaos? Well, just because Jimmy's a brainiac doesn't mean he likes doing school work. His teacher has assigned him a book report. Instead of actually reading a book, Jimmy creates a machine that will project a book's contents into movie form. However, the containment field gets fried, sucking Retroville into the book (which just happens to be about Jet Fusion, the renowned James Bond-like spy).   Not only is Jimmy inside a spy novel, but Jet Fusion has been kidnapped by the Evil Dr. Calamitous, and all of Jimmy's friends have been turned into super-villains. It's up to the Boy Genius to save Jet Fusion and stop Calamitous from taking over the real world.   The disappearing cannibal. Gameplay  Jimmy travels through five themed worlds on 16 different missions to try and piece together the mess he's made of reality. On your travels you'll visit the Lindbergh School, an Asian village, a tropical island, the deep ocean, and finally Calamitous' lair. Of course, Jimmy isn't on a sight seeing trip. He has to fight off everything from pirates and ninjas to cannibals. Along the way he has to collect invention pieces so that he can build devices to help him overcome obstacles, battery power to use many of Goddard's features (Jimmy's robotic dog), and NavChips, which allow Jimmy to warp to the next level.   While many might find such a collect-a-thon task daunting, Jet Fusion will never leave the player stumped. Designed for kids (as you might have guessed from the cartoon material and Nickelodeon licensing), Jet Fusion leads players through levels with trails of batteries (the most common collectable). If for some reason the player can't follow the obvious trails laid out for you Hansel and Gretel-style, it only takes a glance at the map to figure out where the next objective is since invention pieces, objectives, and save points are all marked on Goddard's radar.   Environmental hazards like poisonous gas or ninjas are easily avoided. Jimmy, thanks to Goddard's upgradeability, has a shield he can use to deflect attacks (but it depletes battery power) and has multiple gadgets that can be used to incapacitate bad guys. His first such weapon is a Pulse Light Ray, which shoots light beams at enemies.    If Jimmy isn't feeling too keen about shooting his victims with light, air, or magnetic blasts, he can always send Goddard in with ~play dead mode.~ In this mode, granted that there's enough battery power, Jimmy takes control of Goddard and sends him in on a kamikaze mission to self destruct in a fiery blast. This will defeat the more powerful enemies -- and Jimmy, being the mechanical genius he is, can resurrect Goddard for another explosive attack.   Goddard can also be turned into various modes of transport, like a hover boat or go-kart. Once every level, Goddard takes part in some sort of race against one of the locals. Although you can win as long as you don't crash into an oil slick or get hosed down by cannibals, the mini-game races are a nice diversion from cosntant platforming and light puzzle solving.   These races are also how Jimmy usually acquires needed items, like the tools he uses to complete some of the puzzle elements. Some puzzles are as simple as Jimmy using his Pulse Light Ray to activate solar panels or his Magnetic Tuner to pull magnetic switches or move metal objects. At other times, these tools will be needed for more than mere lever pulling -- occasionally they'll be needed to solve fairly simplistic puzzles. The first true puzzle (although it doesn't involve Jimmy's tools), puts Jimmy in a sumo wrestling ring. Jimmy has to conquer the reigning champ in order to acquire a needed puzzle piece. To do this, you simply need to press the corresponding button when it appears on screen. Another puzzle requires you to rotate mirrors with the Magnetic Tuner so that a beam of light will hit a sensor panel.   Even though Jimmy lacks mental challenge, it doesn't mean you won't encounter plenty to be frustrated with. Jimmy just doesn't jump very well -- it takes a mighty tap of the A button to make him leap across rather small gaps. Early platforming elements aren't at all complicated, but Jimmy will often fall to his demise because he is rarely capable of jumping the required distance.  These inopportune falls always seem to occur over or around water -- which is Jimmy's kryptonite. If the Boy Genius so much as touches water, he dies -- why he doesn't know how to swim is a mystery.   At the end of each level, Jimmy will square off against someone he knows from the real world who has taken on a villainous role. Most bosses have a trick to them that involves using whichever gadget you acquired in that level -- adding a little more than button mashing to your boss battles.   When all hope is lost, you can always spend your time searching out special collectibles like movie parts or white candies. If you collect all these objects in the game, you'll be able to unlock a movie gallery, bio cards, or a variety of movies giving those Jimmy Neutron fans out there something extra to work for.   Graphics  While Jet Fusion's in-game graphics aren't in the exact style as the cartoon series, they look pretty darn close. They're slightly more traditional cartoon looking than the computer animation of Jimmy Neutron -- although the cut scenes do look like they were made using the same animation as the show. The game runs smoothly, without any graphical hiccups -- even if Jet Fusion recycles enemy character models with the best of them.   Even the camera behaves itself. The camera will stay focused in a forward direction, allowing Jimmy to run around the environment without constantly changing the viewing angle. If you need to see a certain angle, the camera is fully adjustable on the x-axis. However, you can't use the camera to look up, which would have been useful to scope out multi-tiered areas before you actually climb up a ladder or stairs.   Sound  The musical score isn't all that impressive and is stuck on repeat throughout entire levels. The same can be said for the sound effects. You'll hear enemies yell as they charge at you, Jimmy's footsteps, and a few random back drop noises, but they aren't enough to really bring the world to life. What does make up for this lack of aural creativity is the use of the original voice actors. Jimmy Neutron sounds like Jimmy, Sheen is Sheen, etc. Since Jimmy Neutron doesn't use immersive sounds in the series, having the voice actors play such a large role in the game's aural experience makes it seem as though you're actually playing through an episode of the cartoon.     Jimmy Neutron is far from a bad game, but there's not enough substance here to captivate an audience over the age of ten. The puzzles are simplistic, combat is easy, and you're basically led through the entire game simply by the placement of items. However, this was designed with kids in mind, and on that level it succeeds. The challenge is simple enough to not be too hard for a young gamer, but easy enough that there won't be a ton of frustration. They might even have to use their brain on occasion. Also, the pace between wandering around adventure style, platforming, racing, and boss battling is pretty fast. The shift between gameplay styles should be enough to keep younger gamers entertained past their bedtimes.Jet Fusion isn't going to win any awards or display any revolutionary gameplay, there's barely enough here to keep mature gamers conscious, but if you're a fan of Jimmy Neutron or are shopping for a younger audience -- Jimmy Neutron: Jet Fusion is a safe bet -- but a rental is probably wiser than a purchase.", "date": "Sep 23, 2003"}
