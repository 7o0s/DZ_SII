Except last year the DS rendition of the movie about cars became a minigame collection. For some reason there's another Cars game out, and developer Tantalus has done the obvious: Cars Mater-National is a, gasp, racing game! It's cute and kid-friendly, but never quite makes it into fifth gear.   Unlike the previous Cars title for the DS, which featured minigames mixed with barebones racing, Mater-National is simply a racing game. It picks up after the end of the film, and Lightning McQueen has set up his headquarters in Radiator Springs. The fastest race car in the country, along with the prospect of the new racing stadium being built, attracts cars from all over the world to compete against McQueen.   Story mode consists of 17 races across 14 different tracks. In addition to the story mode is a Challenge Mode that has 28 events in three different categories: Trophy Hunt, Elimination, and Beat the Clock. It's a pretty decent amount of races for a handheld title. Each Challenge Mode event, with the exception of Elimination, brings something different to the gameplay to make it worth playing.   There's obviously a lot of work that went into capturing the feeling of the film. The cars and environments are pretty well done. They're nothing spectacular, but the cutscenes and races capture the design of the film well enough. A few of the famous voices are used too, including Tony Shaloub, and quite a bit of talking from Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. Even Masi Oka lends his voice to one of the international racers.   Say Later, Mater. In addition, the tracks showcase various spots in and around Radiator Springs, and many of them will be familiar to fans of the film. Iconic spots like the Wagon Wheel Motel and Willie's Butte have tracks themed around them. The original tracks are also fairly interesting. The underground cavern level that requires playing with night vision goggles takes what would be an unimpressive track and gives it enough of a twist to be cool.   It would have been nice if driving on the tracks was as interesting as the tracks themselves. Mater-National is a very basic 3D racing game. Players select one of 10 Cars characters and compete in a three lap race against three other characters. Each track has a few different shortcuts to take, and each one has a golden hubcap that unlocks new characters and paint jobs. Based on how well they place, players earn stars that open up the other tracks. It's not necessary to earn first place in each track, but the golden hubcap only counts if the player finishes first. It's not a problem, though, because the game is a cake walk (or, rather, cake drive).   It's a good difficulty level for young children, but there is absolutely no challenge at all for anyone else. The Story Mode and Elimination matches only have three opponents, so the stakes don't feel very high. The AI racers drive pretty well, often times taking the shortcuts and knowing when to drift, but they're slow enough to easily pass up. A more difficult mode would have really helped this game because as it is, it's only suitable for the youngest racing fans.   And while it might not be noticed by the younglings, the game lacks a certain sense of polish within the actual races. The sense of speed is not very strong, and doing things like drifting around corners and using boost doesn't change the game much. The draw distance isn't quite long enough either, so trees, rocks, and even entire canyon walls will just appear on screen during the stretches of track.   A saving grace for the game is the single card multiplayer. With just one copy of Cars, up to four people can race on any of the tracks, and using any of the characters, the owner has unlocked. Plus the game can hold multiple save slots, so it works perticularly well as a game for multi-kid families.It's definitely a better decision to get Cars Mater-National over the DS prequel, but, unless the recipient is in the elementary school age bracket, it's still not recommended. The game has enough charm and movie references to be cool for major fans of the film. However, the racing is really rather basic, keeping it from being a real competitor in the racing game genre. Had there been a harder difficulty option, and had the actual racing been a little more polished, we would recommend a purchase. Instead it's only worth a test drive.", "date": "Dec 1, 2007"}
