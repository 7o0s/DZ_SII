Two ninja clash, mid-air, each with just a single strike. One falls to the ground defeated -- Ken Hayabusa. Ken's son Ryu finds a letter the next day, left for him by his fallen father. It tells him to take up their clan's legendary blade and travel to America. That's where the story begins.   Ninja Gaiden is centered on its story. A great, classic action/ platformer title from Tecmo in 1989, Gaiden's most notable and memorable innovation wasn't in its fast gameplay or tight control; it was in how it conveyed its plot. Cinematic cutscenes, shown before, after and sometimes during the title's action stages, painted vividly the world of demons, swords and secret agents in which Ryu Hayabusa found himself entwined. It was a novel approach to in-game storytelling in an age where most other titles were content to provide the plot only in the instruction manual, if at all.           The landmark achievement in narrative would be enough to recommend revisiting the game on its own, so it's a bonus that it plays great too. You control Ryu in a series of side-scrolling action stages, jumping, slashing and wall-jumping your way to progress. Ninja Gaiden's feel is incredibly satisfying, as bouncing back and forth off of walls, spinning through the air and dispatching enemies all come off quickly and easily. An arsenal of secondary weapons can be found throughout each stage, including throwing stars, boomeranging shuriken and flying wheels of flame. And you'll need to wield each and every one with mastery, because there's little room for error.   Ninja Gaiden is relentless -- one of the classic NES action designs where the challenge factor is set to kill. Maneuvering Ryu over, around and through each stage's countless enemies and obstacles can be remarkably tough, and many early NES gamers never made it through even half the stages of the adventure. There are six in all, each one sub-divided into smaller areas, and each one lorded over by a boss character at the end. The earliest bosses are easy; the later ones, though, not so much.    The difficulty could be a turn-off for new players, but then that's always been Ninja Gaiden's calling card. The series got its start in the arcades, but its first coin-op title had little to do with where the series went next -- here on the NES, where it really began. Two sequels followed on the 8-bit Nintendo, and then Ryu went mostly silent for several years. His adventures finally resumed in 2004's Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox, where the intense challenge first seen in 1989 was brought back, reinvigorated, and made into the signature trait of the franchise.Be well warned ahead of time: this isn't the kind of game you can pick up and breeze through on your first try. Completing the adventure takes practice and patience, both of which you'll likely be willing to invest given the solid and satisfying gameplay and the fact that you'll want to see how the story ends. Getting to the next cutscene, seeing the next piece of the plot, was a motivation not used before Ninja Gaiden in 1989. That novel sequence of events, paired with the high degree of difficulty, made this first Gaiden game a hit. A hit that started Tecmo's most powerful franchise, and a hit that's certainly worth the asking price.", "date": "May 14, 2007"}
