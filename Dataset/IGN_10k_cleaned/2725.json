Seriously, I do. More accurately I wonder if there is any type of preparedness at all on the part of the programmers when something this foul oozes out of the silicon factory. Rarely have I seen in fact, an auto title so terribly off-base in focus and execution as Inland Productions latest Monster Truck piece, Monster Jam: Maximum Destruction.   Already responsible for arguably the worst wrestling games to ever grace the PlayStation One back in the day (WCW Nitro, WCW/NWO Thunder), Inland Productions has a lot to live down. And while I can certainly respect the developer's efforts at trying something new for the car combat genre, I can't respect the finished effort. A visually pleasing representation of oversized car mashers to be sure, the piss-poor gameplay model overshadows any positive the title has to offer.   Graphicssize=5>  Easily the most appealing aspect of Monster Jam is its visuals. Stuffed to the rafters with a range of varying textures, some nice anti-aliasing effects, and comparable lighting, your eyes will beg you to like the game in the early going. Particularly impressive when glancing at a given truck in the ~Viewer~, the heavily polygonal automobiles are a sight to behold. Although, for best results one must make sure that there are as few objects on the screen as possible.   And that's attributable to the more-than-chunky frame rate issues that pop up the minute too many cars are on the set at once. While the single player, full-screen mode suffers minimally with few stutters or pauses; the two-person option severely begins to bog down the action. As busy with animation as most of the stages are (to its credit), having so much activity processed at one time moves the FPS down to a level that has to be in the high-teens. Toss in a third or fourth player for good measure, and you'll likely find a more fluid display in a second-grader's ~running monkey~ flipbook.   Which is truly a shame, because regardless of how great the game may look standing still, the hiccupping animation creates a myriad of gameplay issues. Including the fact that when playing more than solo, the choppy conglomerate of cars can create so much wild eyed confusion, that it's not uncommon to blow up and self-destruct because you simply couldn't see one of the game's usually obvious pitfalls. Which isn't to say that the game didn't have issues in that department to begin with.   Featuressize=5>  Which brings us to the second most prolific attribute that Monster Jam entrusts, its options. While it appears on the surface that there's plenty to see and do, all the names and titles that populate the menus are really just prime examples of ~rehash 101~.   As is typical now in racers and car-related products these days, you have the standard season and exhibition races with three subcategories to choose from in each. Whether you want to destroy your fellow cars in ~Death Match~, snatch as much money as possible in ~Cash Grab~, or earn the highest score possible with ~Points~, the type of career you want to pursue is up to you. It's a nice option to be given fore sure, although we suspect most people will opt for the latter choice as it possesses the most redeeming qualities of the three (more on that later).   If you're looking for more, there's also a mini-game selection that offers far more variety for players with Attention Deficit Disorder. An interesting idea yes, but most of them are just quickie clones of certain areas of the season mode, and a couple of afterthought attempts at diversity. For the sake of being thorough however, we offer the following brief descriptions of each:   Stadium Freestyle:  Earn a prerequisite amount of points by performing spins, jumps, wheelies, and car crushes. Do it all before time runs out inside a classical Monster Truck stadium setting (One Player Only).   Stadium Race:  Just as it sounds, you'll race through the same stadium that you used for freestyle in quick five lap heat. Wee.   Lava Island:  Become king of the hill and destroy or knock off other trucks from the volcano surrounded by a 360-degree chasm around its edges.   Canyon Race:  Another race ala Stadium, only this time you're zooming through a big open canyon; definitely more challenging than the first race.   Stadium Challenge:  Back to the stadium we go, this time for another king of the hill type match where you must destroy all your opponents to win.   Arena Challenge:  More Deathmatch action, with an ancient Roman Coliseum setting and a much bigger area to operate; sound familiar?   Now tell me how many of those sounds like the same thing to you? While the option of having a choice is a welcome addition to any videogame, regardless of genre, the apparent lack of effort when dealing with what kinds of things you can do is readily apparent.   At least they saw fit to include a boatload of trucks. Running the gamut from popular favorites like Grave Digger and Destroyer to comic book licensed entries Wolverine, Hulk, and Spider-Man; chances are you'll find just the right shell to fit your personality. There's even a couple of the old WCW Wrestletrucks in there too, which will let you use such classic heaps as Goldberg and Sting. For an added bonus, all the vehicles can be upgraded in multiple categories to allow for faster acceleration and better traction.   Gameplaysize=5>  Described best (or is it worst?) as a cross between Destruction Derby Raw and Twisted Metal: Black, Monster Jam tries to no avail to be a kick ass car combat game. Combining the premise of smashing your opponents and obstacles to bits with weapon-based mini-battles, the unbalanced experiment never works out. While the premise is sound, and could be expanded on in the future, this particular instance makes the whole idea look like a lost cause.   To begin with, the control is far too squirrelly and requires constant adjustment of the digital and analog pad to keep from banging into walls. A great opportunity to show the difference between your selections in cars, the end result does nothing to exploit it. Regardless of your car's statistics or upgrades, there isn't a noticeable difference between the handling of any of them, and you're left with the realization that your choice in motorized beast was nothing more than a mask for the same basic truck type.   The track design doesn't help much either, as the admittedly huge stages are no where near the brilliance of the multi-level worlds of Twisted Metal. Populated with a plethora of little objects that you can run over and destroy and plenty of ramps and hills, there's a modicum of effort in there, but not enough to immerse you into the make-believe world. Explore each stage once, and chances are that your curiosity will be satisfied with nothing left to satiate you other than the poorly executed gameplay model.   Other problems, like the aforementioned frame rate issue and incredibly difficult A.I. opponents that are found beyond the ~normal~ level of difficulty continue to frustrate. Not to mention the engine that promotes the use of weapons and crashing into your opponents that is hampered by too few power-ups and not enough health replenishment. In a nutshell, it's all an unbalanced mess of game that could have used more tuning before leaving the gate.   If there is one redeeming quality in the whole joke that we call Monster Jam, it would probably be the point feature. Requiring you to run around destroying everything you can for a set amount of points, it's the only hint at actual entertainment. In fact, you'll probably find yourself so angry for playing through it, that you'll feel the need to hurt the game physically in some way. What better solution than to spend about half an hour destroying everything in sight before returning it to the store you bought it at?A poorly executed example of how to tackle the car combat genre, Monster Jam doesn't deserve your attention regardless of your affinity for the sport or similar interests. Best used as an alternate to torture when countering annoying relatives or bothersome houseguests, you're better left to playing the far superior Twisted Metal: Black than giving this one any type of second thought.
