Allow me to lower any expectations you might have for the mobile games flanking the film's release. After the non-starter adventure game, The Da Vinci Code: Helix hits cells with a familiar puzzle formula that doesn't excite either side of the brain.   Helix follows the basic Zuma-esque formula of players blasting colored balls into a snaking chain of spheres. Position three or more in a row and they disappear. Sometimes this help breaks up the snake, buying you extra time while the back half catches up to the front half. If the chain makes it to a hole at the end of the track, the game is over. While playing, you can catch power-ups that fall from the chain that affect game play. You can get a laser that eradicates several balls, slow down the chain's progress, temporarily reverse course, and more.   So, what does all of this have to do with the movie and book? Well, developer Sandcastle has managed to weave the plot loosely between the puzzles, as each series of tracks represents your progress through a set piece. The tracks themselves are designed to look like religious symbols, which is also kinda cool -- even if the designs aren't exactly always very playable. And the power-ups look like religious artifacts, such as grails and Templar crosses.   But even if the look of the game is appropriate for the source material, Helix is still an afterthought -- a cash-run mobile designed to hype a movie and maybe pocket a quick buck while the iron is hot.  Helix is an incredibly derivative puzzler that offers absolutely nothing new. That said, the implementation of theme is quite solid, from the overall design of the puzzles to the plot threads that are weaved between the puzzle sets. But that's just not inspiration enough for anybody to part with several dollars. I took the bullet for you this time -- pay me back by not rewarding this kind of on-the-cheap cash-in.", "date": "May 16, 2006"}
