It has never tried to be a basketball simulation and its fans have never expected it to be. Rather, Jam supporters have come to expect anything but realism from the franchise in the way of two-on-two play, super-exaggerated dunks, flaming basketballs, guiltless fouling, high-flying athletes and other various wackiness.  Midway's NBA Hangtime -- basically Jam minus the license - served as Nintendo 64's only exposure to the series. And despite its flaws, the game really wasn't all that bad.   Now, Iguana West and Acclaim have released a polygonal 3D update to the series and it proves to be much more ~sim~ than it is Jam.   The Facts  All 29 NBA teams and authentic arenas. More than 300 players with realistic face and skin textures. 640x480 high-resolution graphics. New five-on-five gameplay mode and authentic team play stiles. More than 500 motion-captured moves. Play by Play from TNT's Kevin Harlan and color commentary from NBC basketball analyst Bill Walton. Arena announcing by Dan Roberts of the Utah Jazz. Five different gameplay modes: shoot out, exhibition, season, custom season and playoffs. Unique signature moves and free throw routines. Total team management: trading, drafting, signing and releasing players. Scouting reports. Create-a-player and create-a-team. Season stats in more than 200 categories. Historical simulations. Instant replay and multiple camera angles. 1-4 players. Rumble Pak support. Memory Pak support.   Gameplay NBA Jam 99 plays very well by simulation standards, but fails to deliver the Jam goods fans might be expecting. The game features an impressive selection of different gameplay modes and options, control feels tight and precise and everything moves along at a steady pace. However, even in the game's Jam mode -- which is placed more as an alternative to standard simulation than it is the game's buying point - the action unfolds as a simulation would. The two-on-two matches of old are gone. The spectacular dunks of old, while present, are certainly not in abundance and just don't bear the same sense of arcade excitement. Jam 99 moves all-around slower than an arcade-like basketball game. This in itself is not necessarily a bad thing. However, given that the title scarcely dabbles in the license it features though, we feel it should be noted: NBA Jam this is not.  Rather, Jam 99 is a simulation basketball title. Realistic five-on-five action, season statistics tracking, player management, official players and license and the works. And everything said and done, it's not a bad one. Icon and analog passing, a polished sense of control and a good selection of moves are proof of that. Whether or not it Jam 99 outperforms NBA Courtside or NBA Live - at least in the gameplay department - is definitely a matter of personal preference. Live is faster and Courtside is a bit more simulation-like. Jam falls somewhere in-between. You'll like it for its options, its multiple gameplay modes and multiplayer offerings.   Graphics What Jam 99 does feature over just about every other basketball game we've seen, is, of course, unsurpassed graphics. And developed by Iguana West, the maker of WWF Warzone, this should come as no surprise. Like most Iguana N64 products, Jam runs in 640x480 high-resolution mode and pumps out realistic animations for just about everything that moves. Athletes run and score with fluid realism even when the dunks or shots they're executing are impossible in accordance with the laws of gravity. Polygonal models are sharp and detailed, though it must be said that they appear to be lacking anything resembling a neck. As is almost a tradition with all Iguana sports games, the crowd texture is bland, flat and obviously ignored in order to ensure more pretty visuals on the court. Finally, the game slows down slightly when multiple players are huddled underneath the rim and players go in for a dunk. Nothing terrible, but worth a mention. Especially since we're ~framerate tarts.~ Sound  The commentary in Jam 99 is actually extremely well-executed. Play-by-play calls from Kevin Harlan and color additions from Bill Walton are always dead-on and crystal clear. Best of all, there is quite a bit of voice in the game and though commentary is sometimes repetitive, it's certainly not as irritating as that heard in other sports games for Nintendo 64. ~It's a home-run!~ anybody? Very impressive sound-compression from Iguana.  Music and sound effects, on the other hand, are more on the bland side. Don't expect the stylistic beats found in Courtside. With all the commentary though, it probably doesn't matter. Don't be fooled by this game's name, it's not really a Jam title. While Iguana West has included a handful of arcade-like goodies to satisfy the license, Jam 99 is much more a simulation style basketball game. It's a bit slower-paced than most basketball offerings and it lacks character, much in the same way that ASB 99 or QB Club 98 do. And yet, it's still quite a bit of fun, especially with four-players. Framerates are smooth, control precise and gameplay polished. Visually, Jam 99 is unequaled. All in all, a fun basketball game that fails to deliver on its license.", "date": "Dec 16, 1998"}
