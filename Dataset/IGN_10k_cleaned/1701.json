Countless other's who wouldn't otherwise be caught dead with a game have repeated this very same passage, but the final proof that the Sonic Team maracas game has massive appeal beyond the few thousand who will buy it came through my Mom.  Yes, my mom.  Let me tell you about my mom.  She has a very unfortunate belief that games are diversions made exclusively for kids.  She sees that I deal with games for a living, and she's just baffled  And yet, she decided to give Samba De Amigo a try, without my even forcing her to it.  Sure, in the few times she played the game's training mode, she rarely got a beat right, but she was having a blast.  The best peripheral-based music games encourage players to actually dance as they play, and if you observe the Dance Dance Revolution masters, you'll observe that they're doing a whole lot more with their body than just tapping sections on a pad.  They're dancing, just as the title suggests, and with Samba De Amigo, the same holds true.  I'm not sure if I'm ~Sambaing~ per se, but when I play Samba De Amigo, I can't help but get into it.  I bend lower than I need to for the low shakes, I leap up from a crouch to get the high shakes, I shake the maracas more than necessary - not because I'm cheating, but because I just can't help it.  Am I alone?  The new Version 2000 of the game, which was just released to Japan (and didn't even make an appearance on the top ten - ugh) and will be released to America in the form of Samba De Amigo 2001 in the Summer of 2001, takes the basics from the original, adds a few new songs and a few new ideas, and charges you 60 bucks for the whole she-bang.  But boy is it worth the price, even for gamers who already own the original!  New to the game is the Hustle maneuver, which complements the rest of the gameplay perfectly.  The normal Samba play requires that you do one of the following: shake your maracas in one of six positions relative to your body (sometimes fast, sometimes slow), or sustain an extended goofball looking pose with the maracas.  So what's missing?  How about a move that requires you to rapidly sway the Maracas between two of the positions?  That, in a single sentence, is what it means to hustle in Samba De Amigo 2000.  You'll hustle with one Maraca between the top two positions (as with the rest of the game, it doesn't matter which Maraca you use to pull off the move).  You'll turn to the side and hustle with both maracas between the top left and left-most positions (careful not to bash your Maracas together -- this is one peripheral that's too expensive for contact sports).  The hustle maneuver is used masterfully with the normal shaking and the posing, and some of the songs from the original are actually more enjoyable with the new moves.  The only problem with the hustle mode is it seems to give some trouble to the Maraca sensor.  It's hard to get a feel for hustling between the bottom corner positions, and I still can't figure out how to consistently make a 360 with a single Maraca.  On top of this, the game still has the detection problems of the original, where you'll point a maraca in one direction and the screen will register it in a different direction.  And yes, the wires still get in the way (that's not going to change until some wise third party makes a wireless Maracas device... I'd buy it).   As with the original game, though, these little problems are easily overlooked when you consider that Sonic Team has shrunk a ten thousand dollar arcade machine into an 80 dollar peripheral (my copy of the game was free... not sure about yours, though).  Plus, you've got head problems if you find yourself growing maracas-tossing frustrated just because the game didn't register exactly what you did 100% of the time - Samba De Amigo is just too much fun for that.  Thankfully, Sonic Team has equipped Samba De Amigo ver. 2000 with more than just the hustle maneuver to make this game worth the price even if you already have the original.  The game includes all the songs from the original (the save file, by the way, is incompatible with the American version, so you're going to have to redownload the new songs as they appear at Sonic Team's website).  Also included is a fantastic set of new songs, ranging in style from remixed US pop culture mainstays (wait until you hear the Rocky Theme under its new veil) to more Latin fare such as Volare and Salome.  I actual prefer many of the new songs to the original songs.  You should also keep in mind that gamers in Japan are, for the first time, getting to try out Cup of Life and Livin' La Vida Loca - those two songs were removed from the Japanese version of the game due to copyright problems.  Maybe Sega of America will give us something extra when the game comes out stateside...  All the songs can be played in two ways, with the hustle maneuvers included, or with just the standard shaking and posing.  This basically doubles the amount of replay value from the original, as the new patterns make for a completely different experience (the replay value goes up from infinity to infinity times two) - although it should be mentioned that some songs don't work well with the hustle moves.  You can unlock new songs for either mode through download, as mentioned above, or by beating the arcade mode and the tough challenge mode.  Also included is a silly volleyball mini-game in which you play as Amigo the monkey and attempt to take on the various other characters in a fifteen game match.  You'll probably try this once, then ignore it.  The game has insane replay value beyond just multiplayer because of these modes of play, and because the Samba De Amigo gameplay never gets old.  Trust me on this one - even if you don't have a friend in the world, make a friend out of Amigo the monkey and pick up this game - you won't grow tired of it soon.  Also making the return are the tremendous production values Sonic Team put into creating their first music game.  The characters return full of life and are joined by Amiga, a companion to Amigo.  The characters dance and have a fiesta de Dreamcast in the background as you play, and although you probably won't notice it, there's an amazing graphical showcase being put on, with tons of animation, blazing color and dynamic changes.  As with the original, the load times are next to nothing, making this perfect for the impatient.  You'll also find a slightly improved interface which makes menu selection easier (although I still wish the Maracas had D-pads on them somewhere).    Consider this update a complete replacement for the original game, just as NFL2K1 is a complete replacement of NFL2K.  Sell your copy of the original, pick up this new version, and your maracas will be kept out for weeks.  And please, loosen up when you play this particular game.   -- Anoop Gantayat, Guest Publisher", "date": "Jan 5, 2001"}
