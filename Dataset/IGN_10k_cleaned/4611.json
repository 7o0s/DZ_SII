After all, who doesn't enjoy blowing up their friends after a hard day's work? The good news is that Hudson and Nintendo have teamed up yet again to bring one more installment of the Bomberman series to Nintendo 64 in Bomberman Hero. The bad news, or at least part of it, is that the game has absolutely no multiplayer mode. No, we aren't lying -- there's no multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, there's even more bad news, the game isn't much of a platformer either.   The Facts   Five worlds with more than 60 levels. Bomberman can now jump and hang on ledges in addition to throwing bombs. Special items like the Bomber Copter, Bomber Jet, Bomber Slider and the Bomber Marine aid now aid Bomberman in his quest. Saves to EEPROM. Rumble Pak Compatible. Mulitplayer support not included. Multiplayer support not included. Did we mention that this game doesn't support multiple players?  Story The tale behind Bomberman Hero is of such epic proportions that we're not sure if mere words can do it justice, but we'll try. One day, as Bomberman is training hard to ~keep the universe peaceful,~ a spaceship crash-lands into the ~Peace Mountains~ near him. He investigates and, to his surprise, finds a lone robot, which explains that it has just escaped an attack by the Garaden Empire. Unfortunately, the robot's princess Millian was not so lucky. And so Bomberman begins his quest to save her before it's too late.   Gameplay Here's how it works. Imagine Super Mario 64. The clever level design, intuitive controls, variety, freedom, it's all missing from Bomberman Hero. Instead, players can jump and toss bombs at enemies. Bomberman's newly added jumping ability is executed quite well, but even with its fixed view point, players will often have trouble seeing where they're supposed to be jumping next. Hudson has attempted to make Bomberman Hero a full-blown 3D platformer on rails, much like Crash Bandicoot on PlayStation, from the game's never-ending range of ~platforms~ to its cute characters, rising worlds and end-level bosses -- but in comparison, even Chameleon Twist plays better and is ultimately more satisfying. On the bright side, the game does serve a balanced selection of vehicles that our hero can use to his advantage, whether he be flying through a 3D canyon or swimming through an underwater, err, canyon. Still, each level is so confining and so very unoriginal that these miniscule additions do little to further enhance the overall experience.  Multiplayer Mode In a decision that can only be described as pure brilliance, Hudson has opted to eliminate Bomberman's multiplayer mode this time around. Kind of like a meatless burger, huh? Military Intelligence, jumbo shrimp, pretty ugly  I'm running out of oxymorons here, but you get the point. What's the point of Bomberman without a multiplayer mode? C'mon, Hudson.  Graphics Cute, cuddly and lacking detail. The game suffers from framerate problems despite the fact that it isn't pushing very many polygons. In fact, many of the enemies look almost naked in comparison to the characters in most new Nintendo 64 games. That said, this is by no means an ugly game -- it's just the epitome of ~first generation.~ For example, upon approaching a boss, players will see nothing until they are literally feet away, at which time a giant hulking monster will pop-up out of nowhere. Draw-in problems galore. On a more positive note, some characters are just silly enough to keep the game mildly amusing. All in all, nothing to write home about, but players won't need to cover their eyes either.   Sound  Why yes, this game does feature sound. When Bomberman jumps, for example, a laser-like noise can be heard. Loads of chimes and bells are also in abundance. Bombs sound like bombs, water splashes sound like water splashes. Sound effects are cute and decidedly average. The music (partially inspired by the original Bomberman theme), on the other hand, is bland, repetitive and sometimes downright annoying.  Put quite simply, this is Bomberman without the multiplayer mode. That's kind of like Jaws without the killer great white. What's the point? It's obvious that Hudson wanted to transform its franchise into a more platformer-ready experience, but Bomberman Hero doesn't look or play nearly as good as the likes of Banjo-Kazooie or Super Mario 64. It's only advantage, in my opinion, was its multiplayer mode. Without it, Bomberman Hero is just an average platformer that isn't likely to impress anyone. Rent it if you must, but don't invite your friends over.", "date": "Sep 17, 1998"}
