My reasoning goes like this: Since we all seem doomed to play these wrist obliterators until the end of time (a rare and wonderfully tortuous experience that requires the application of little thought and negative skill), why don't we broaden our horizons and attempt to cater to a wider masochistic audience by selling a game that's just a ticking clock and a car battery with a pair of jumper cables?   In my game, ~Let's Needlessly Subject Ourselves to Unending Agony,~ players will be instructed to attach the battery via the provided wires to their faces, nipples, or whatever other body part a particular mode may demand. After the attachment process, the game will initiate the clock ticker and a progressively more life threatening electrical current will flow through the wires. The longer we endure the excruciating pain, the greater chance we'll have at attaining a gold medal or some kind of neat ribbon. It's a good idea and I think it could work, but packaging all of those materials into a single box may price ~Let's Needlessly Subject Ourselves to Unending Agony~ out of the hands of average consumers. I suppose we'll just have to settle for Athens 2004. Oh well.  Why videogame adaptations of the Olympics have not yet been able to surpass the precedent set by the Commodore 64 years ago is beyond me. Like so many before it, Athens 2004 offers little more than an excuse to inadvertently break a perfectly fine controller or keyboard by repeatedly mashing its buttons and keys into a fine dust or perhaps some kind of thick plastic pudding. Most events, be they subsets of aquatic races, simple pole vaults, sprints, hurdles, dashes, weight lifting competitions, and more, all necessitate that we robotically pound buttons on our controller until we actually feel discomfort. How is that a gameplay mechanic?    Some of the more clever events, like archery and skeet shooting don't require this at all. Instead, they use twists on the timed reflex mechanics laid out by other rhythm games. These few moments of joy happen to be less depressing than marathon swimming (phalange death), but they're so easy to immediately master, they serve little to no purpose in the grander scheme of things. In fact, the only events that are of any real challenge are the ones that require button mashing and then segue into two or more different rhythm games or three-click systems to initiate actions, but even they are only hard because repeatedly hitting enter and control while slamming on the X and Z keys is a little tough, ergonomically speaking (control configuration is allowed).  If you somehow manage to look past one of the most unfulfilling, legitimately unsettling gameplay experiences around, you'll still not find much of worth. The personalities, strengths, and weaknesses of any Olympians and/or specific nations are completely unrepresented. The only bit of positive to be said about the actual athletes is that they all stereotypically fit the bill for events and change in appearance depending somewhat on their patron nation. There aren't even all the national anthems.   It's a freakish assemblage of decades old gameplay and half-hearted depth that comes delivered by typically mellow golf claps and the umphs and grumphs that athletes usually emit. Visually, Athens 2004 is nothing to laugh at, but disproportionate, gaping-jawed sprinters and swimmers sometimes scare more than they inspire. Even if it were the prettiest game around, you'd rarely know it, as the title insists players' eyes be fixed upon pulsing meters and moving indicators. It's basically a menu lain atop some stuff that happens when you properly interface with the menu.I see absolutely no point to this game. If you're playing Athens for an enjoyable gameplay experience, prepare to absorb a sack of bricks to the wrists. If you're looking for something that authentically and accurately represents the Olympics and all of its components, brace yourself for a disappointment impact not at all dissimilar to getting hit in the chest by a semi-truck. What else could be wanted from a compilation sports Olympic game? It offers none of the thrill of Olympiad victory and none of the fun associated with practically every other sports title available. Athens is simply a set of graphics and audio slapped atop a form of gameplay a robot on a car assembly line could master in eight seconds.A debate I had with a colleague is how long it would take us to construct a LEGO Mindstorm robot that could beat the game better than any human. The current estimate is two days of work.", "date": "Oct 26, 2004"}
