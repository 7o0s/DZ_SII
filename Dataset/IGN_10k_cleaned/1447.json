This genre is quite unlike any other.  Behold its overcrowdedness.  Observe how plump and juicy it is, since it's so swollen with videogames of all names.  Some have Mario or Diddy, some have Crash or Chocobo, and some will have Mickey Mouse.  One in particular has a staff of Warner Brothers' finest.  Let's take a closer look at that one, specifically Looney Tunes Racing.  It's hope? To stand out in the kart racer world.   Fact is, there are too many damn kart racers.  Thanks to Nintendo, the PlayStation has grown fat with go-karts and cute cartoons.  While many of them are fun, there are just too many.  The problem among all of these is that few are original, and all of them mimic Mario Kart in more than one noticeable way.  I predict that by the year 2010, every popular cartoon character will be featured in its own go-kart game.  As long as they're as good as Looney Tunes Racing, I've got no problems.  Folks, this is a fine specimen of a kart racer that we've got on our hands.  Not only does it have a great one-player championship, but it also plays well with others.  This holiday season, this is the kart racer to buy.   Gameplay Finally, at long last, a kart game that goes beyond what Mario Kart's established.  There's no mistaking that these two are similar, but Looney Tunes Racing does it ACME style.  The controls are very basic for this type of game -- you accelerate, brake, fire a weapon, and slide.  What I'm impressed by is how tight everything is.  The game responds immediately to your commands; if you press to the left or to the right, the movements feel very natural and quick. This is some of the best steering I've seen in a kart game.   All your favorite Looney Tunes characters are here.  Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola (makes things a little more PC), Marvin Martian, Wile E. Coyote, and of course, Taz, are all available right off.  You can earn many more characters by playing the game's championship or bonus mode.  Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe le Pew, Yosemite Sam, and others can be earned.  In addition to the 15 regular tracks that make up the championship, there are others that can also be earned by playing the game's features.  My favorite is Wacky Land, which, although in black and white, is by far the coolest track in the game.   All of the tracks are virtual representations of places you've seen in the cartoons.  There are desert canyons, forests, planets from Duck Dodgers, factories, etc. The most innovative tracks I saw were ~What's Opera, Doc?~  and ~More Opera, Doc?~.  If you recall the cartoon with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd in a mock opera, you'll instantly recognize these two tracks.  The detail and creativity in these, as well as that in the other tracks, make these two levels quite exquisite.   Unlike most other kart games, there are interactive obstacles here.  If you run over an ~X~ mark, which is drawn on the ground, you can set off a trap and stop the other opponents dead in their tracks.  There are literally dozens of obstacles in each level.  In the canyons, you can make boulders and pianos fall.  In outer space, lasers beams can fry the racers.  In the opera stage, a prancing, fat white horse can run you over.  In the castle stages, the red, hairy monster runs from one side to another. These original features go one-up over other kart games.   I also really like the weapons system.  Instead of having a random weapon chosen for you whenever you run across an item block, you get to choose what you receive. By running over these item blocks, you can gradually fill your weapons meter. At any time, press the circle button to exhaust the meter, and you'll fire a certain weapon.  The more your bar fills up, the better the weapon you get.  For instance, if you only have two blocks filled, you can drop a bomb.  If you have three, a thundercloud will seek the closest racer and zap him or her with lightning.  If you have five, an anvil will fall on your opponent's head  (it just wouldn't be Looney Tunes without anvils).  You can have up to six levels filled.   Like its name implies, Looney Tunes Racing is wacky as all get out.  It stays true to the cartoons of old, and manages to be a great game from head to toe.  The two-player game is just as immersive, if not more-so than the one-player.  Strap yourself and a buddy down for a good racing session, because this one satisfies.  I had a few good, intense matches, myself.  The bonus mode offers a little variety over the championship by giving players objectives in each round.  For example, in addition to winning the match, you have to ~tag~ your opponents a certain number of times with weapons.  By completing the bonus mode, you open up a gallery of art and unlock racers and tracks.   Graphics Although not immensely spectacular, Looney Tunes Racing has some very nicely detailed areas and maintains a sleek, smooth frame rate.  Playing this is exactly like playing the cartoon.  Boulders, pianos, and anvils drop.  Humongous carrots and a bigger-than-life Elmer Fudd are in the Giant's Garden stage.  The textures used on all of the polygons are perfect, and give this game a nice shine.   Some of the special effects are beautiful.  Although the Wacky Land stage is in black and white, some of the insanely-swirling colors are more than eye-catching.  Planet X Squared, another racetrack, has some nice spacey effects.  The full-motion video should take a hint from the gameplay.  The game itself is exciting and fun to play, but the video is just boring.   Sound Brilliant!  This is the Looney Tunes world you're hearing.  The zany music and bizarre sound effects are so right-on that it's scary.  One of the top reasons for why I loved the opera stages so much is because the music was dead perfect.  The music in general has a serious bearing on making it feel as though the gamer is trapped in this cartoon universe.  The voice acting is done by official Warner Bros. voice actors, and the sound effects, like anvils dropping or the occasional splat, couldn't be better. As a kart racer, or any other for that matter, this is excellent.  I just reviewed a game called Muppet Racing awhile back, and that was also good. Game companies seem to be trying harder at pleasing their customers, and they're doing it right.  Infogrames' zany racer is a load of fun, and one of the best I've ever played to boot.  It may not have as much to unlock as, say, Diddy Kong Racing, but it's got the fun factor down pat.", "date": "Nov 8, 2000"}
