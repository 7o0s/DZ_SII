As evidence that EA felt similarly, the company did not display Castrol Honda Superbike at its massive E3 booth this past May.  The thing about Castrol Honda Superbike, a one- to two-player motorcycle blend of sim and arcade driving styles, is that much like its brethren Sports Car GT, the game itself looks outdated and plays neither stellar nor terribly poor. It's one of those colorless, marginal, excitement-free titles that drives editors like myself totally crazy. It really doesn't suck, but it's not a competitor, nor is it especially fun. Gameplay What Castrol Honda does do right is to cover all of the bases. With six different difficulty levels (Rookie, Novice, Amateur, Semi-professional, Professional, and Ace), a fantastic intro FMV (that shows the kind of excitement you're really missing), and tons of little options (11 total selections in the Option screen), gamers can tweak and customize their bikes and dive into some serious hours of gameplay. Gamers can select four driving viewpoints as well (using the R1 button), check their opponent's progress (through the rear-view mirror, by pressing the L1 button), and after the race, watch a standard replay.  It's in the way that you set up the options that sets the game's tone. For instance, you can choose to take damage (or not), choose to possibly lose your rear wheel, or elect to permit the overheating of the engine. The other options enable gamers to choose more levels of difficulty, including auto brakes, auto or manual transmission, or even help arrows, which point to the direction of the next turn, and more.  Driving a superbike is no small task, and gamers will certainly feel challenged in the Championship mode. After electing to race through a practice session and a qualifying race, players will take on at least seven other racers in a battle of the svelt, skilled, and radical. Gamers can't just rip through turns at 130. No, baby. Real-world physics come into play, causing serious crashes and damage to your vehicles. (To a degree, the crashes are reminiscent of Road Rash, sans the maces, bats, and chains. But even that is pushing it.) Finally, it's nice to see that wheelies and burn outs are readily available, adding to the thrill of powerful racing motorbikes.   Better than most racing games these days, Castrol Honda offers 14 real courses, spanning the globe from the West to the East. In Championship mode, you'll vie against seven others through those many courses, enabling you to master snaking turns and long straight-aways through a standard three-lap. Oppositely, in later courses, such as the Austrian course, you'll race through 24 laps. Whoa! Gamers also have the chance to run simple one race circuits (Single Race), enter into a Trainer Session, or set up play against another humanoid in a split-screen Single Race.  To be honest, this game is for the ultra-super superbike fan, one who loves this specific kind of race so much, he or she can't find any faults in the game, despite the game's Swiss-cheese like gameplay and look. And even the zealous will tire of this game far too soon. The courses, while real, are not terribly challenging, imaginative, nor - and here's the real kicker - fun.  Graphics I thought I already reviewed this game! Sharing the same problems as Sports Car GT, the pixelly graphics, noticeably tortoise-like frame rate, and plain-Jane backgrounds don't add up to a supermodel of a game. It's more like a Sears catalog girdle model of a game. The problem does not to have been Interactive Entertainment's entirely, though, EA shares some of the blame. This game was probably completed last year sometime, and it might - just maybe -- have looked OK then, but now it's just old looking, like a sun-burnt 80-year old woman who smokes, drinks, and farts.   One bright star shines through the haze though, and that's the bike and racer models. The racers, if you can see through the rough smattering of pixels, look almost exactly like the real thing. The bodies, the hunched intensity, and their classic dropping knees in the turns all simulate the real thing damn well. The bikes themselves are excellently detailed, too. The RC45 is slick, compact, and well textured. Too bad the rest of the game didn't look as good.  Sound Well, there's not much to say about the music since there is none in any of the races! D'oh! I guess the developers felt that the real sound effects of the crowd, opponents, and the engines themselves would be enough for the hardcore segment of the market that prays to superbike races.  Well, that leaves a whole lot of folk out of the picture, including me. Racing without music is like driving without the radio or CD player on, or like taking a shower without the water. It's just wrong. I searched the options menu desperately for the music display, but to no avail. The into has music, and so do the menus, but what good are they?   On the other hand, the sound effects are in fact there, a good thing, indeed. There are all there, they're just nothing special. Loud revving engines, crowds cheering, and other bikes driving by. Big deal. As you can tell, this game did not excite me in any way. OK, I liked the crashes and the bike and racer models. But that's it. I can honestly say that anyone who wants to experience a fun motorcycle game can play Motoracer 1 or 2 and have way more fun. Way more fun. Period. Don't even rent this unless every single other game has been rented in every single surrounding county. In fact, you're better off watching old Speed Racer cartoons for a sense of driving goodness than by playing Superbike.", "date": "Jun 2, 1999"}
