While not quite as simulation-like as say...Aero Wings, Air Force Delta serves up some intense dogfight action, some clever missions and a horde of snazzy planes to boot!  Here's how it shakes down.  Loaded with tons of planes to earn and fly, AFD is an incredible reflection back to the days of the PlayStation's Ace Combat.  I mean, it's almost uncanny how much this game resembles and feels like Namco's product.  Since imitation is the highest form of flattery (or so they say) I am sure that this entrant into the Dreamcast launch library has profoundly honored the folks over at Namco.  Releasing contemporaneously with the system, with its actual street date set two days prior on 9.7.99, AFD is poised to be the only combat flight simulation available at (or even close) to launch.  Therefore, it will certainly fill a niche market for such a product, and quite frankly it does its job rather well.  As mentioned in the preview of this title, AFD is a Top Gun-esque combat game in the skies.  The player is contracted by a mercenary and gets to fly a commode-full of planes, for remuneration.    The player commences the game with one plane available, the F-5E Tiger II.  This plane is a middle of the road, single engine fighter that offers moderate mobility and slower speeds.  Players take to the skies in this puppy, and dole out tons of love in the form of missiles and nose-mounted machine gun fire.  Kiss the other guy enough times, and he will swoon for you as he nose dives into the nearby mountains or pavement.  As you develop your fighter-piloting prowess, new planes are unlocked and money money-money-money (mun-aye) is deposited into the player's top secret account for the spending.  This brings an element of resource management into the dynamics of the gameplay.  With all that loot, players can then augment their compliment of aircraft by purchasing upwards of 30 different fighter planes.  Included in the mix are the Migs, the A-10, the F-14, F-15 and F-16, as well as stealth craft.  What is nice about all these planes, is that Konami has done a sweet job of making sure that they each handle differently and are therefore applicable to certain types of sorties one must fly to advance.  And as you move through the game, one high point is definitely mission variety.  Your objectives run the full gamut, from escorts to bombing runs in canyons, train yards, airfields and prison camps.  One thing that was not included, as expected, was the ability to load out your plane with various armaments.  In hindsight, who needs that, when you start each mission with like...sixty (count 'em 60) missiles!  Well, in all honesty, it is an arcade-style flight simulation...didn't I mention that?  Despite having tons of missiles and ammo, you will be amazed at how easy it is to expend all that stuff in a heavy dogfight scenario.  When you shoot your wad, all you are left with is machine gun ammo, and that can be depleted too!  So use the stuff wisely...eh?!   A nice touch would have been to have wingmen to deal with and assign commands to.  But that is not the case here, so you will have to ~wing~ it on your own.  I wonder if that is where that term comes from? Hmmm.  Air Force Delta is not going to win any awards for its appearance.  The game's visual appeal is not the pinnacle of Dreamcast technology, though it does sport a reasonable view distance and some solid graphics. Since you are flying several thousand feet in the sky and therefore have long-range visibility, fog is used to mask draw-in in the extreme distances.  What's nice is that it is rather easy to spot planes way into the distance without too much neck craning.  Effects like contrails from missiles are not nearly as realistic looking as those found in Aero Wings, but the effects are present and aid the game in capturing the soul of what being a fighter pilot, moving through the sky at Mach 1, is all about.   You can also see your pilot in the cockpit of the plane upon replays.  Konami was claiming that AFD would have a dynamic camera system, replete with save options for future use.  Well, replay is included, but the range of camera angles is rather poor.  Instead of making sure there was a stationary cam, to capture the speed of the planes as they flew by, most available cameras are of the forward, side and frontal chase type.  Hence, the replay system is not very exciting to view, as would have been one with a better variety of camera angles.   Something else of concern in the graphics arena is the frame rate.  Upon flying within the walls of canyons, the sense of speed is severely diminished.  Flying within a hundred feet of a canyon wall at 1200 mph should produce some dizzying texture blur.  Unfortunately, that is not the case in AFD.  As a result, the player never seems to attain the sense of speed expected at low altitudes and when in close proximity to other terrain.   Notwithstanding those issues, the plane models are very detailed, the well laid out interface and the mission briefing screens are very easy to read and, more importantly, understand. Waypoints, though not programmable between objectives, are laid out very clearly in the three-quarter overhead 3D diagrams.  Mission objectives are plotted for the player via a grid system that uses icons to symbolize primary and secondary targets. Use of the mission map, while in flight, offers the player visual references in the form of red icons representing critical targets that need swatting for successful completion of the various missions.   There is the customary HUD (heads up display) and it is almost a carbon copy of Ace Combat's.  It shows altitude, direction, velocity, missile compliment, damage and a small radar targeting map.  The player can change the color of the HUD to their liking, from green to orange.   Speaking of color, the palette in AFD is average, as are the quality of the textures.  There is a repeated overuse of textures such as water and other surfaces. This diminishes the organic look that the terrain could have had.  Cityscapes and the like are pretty neatly drawn and rendered, so you cities look like cities.  Actually, I am not sure that more than what is already there (graphically) is needed to satisfy the experience.  However, the Dreamcast is resting some of its laurels on how powerful it is, and AFD does not seem to take advantage of that fact.  What is nice is that the load times are extremely brisk; which is a refreshing change of pace for those of us used to PlayStation load sequences.  Currently, there is no way to abort a mission once it begins without simply slamming your plane into something rather hard.  That is an odd oversight if you ask me.   The music is diverse but average stuff.  Take-off sounds are all the same, so don't expect any variety there either.  Even the in-flight sounds of the various panes show little to no difference in sonic ambiance, and trust me on this, I am really trying not to be picky.  The sounds of ammunition escaping the muzzle of the machine turret are nice, as are the sounds of missiles firing.  The music is also very apropos during the transitional screens, such as menus and briefings.  That should be some consolation for the folks in the audio department.   In the end, AFD is a niche title that does what it is supposed to, albeit a bit slowly in terms of speed.  But when one considers the fact that this game does so closely resemble and feel like Ace Combat, one cannot help but realize that the title is sure to please many fans of that series.  That in mind, AFD is an enjoyable, albeit very arcade experience, which many will find pure pleasure in playing.  While it may not be the most gorgeous flight game on the system to date (those honors go to Aero Wings) it is the only combat flight simulation, and it is a damn good one to boot!  The graphics are all I can say positive about the game, for Climax developed a great engine but failed to attach a good game to it. The game is colorful, smooth, and impressive in looks, but when you wrap your hands around a system and actually play it, that's when the snoozefest begins. You can only stand flying up and down, pummeling craft with machine guns and rockets for so long...the tedium sets in quickly. This air combat game runs out of fuel after the first couple missions.", "date": "Sep 9, 1999"}
