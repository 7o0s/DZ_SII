The day Sega of America put its first completely free, Dreamcast VMU title on the web for download. The game: VMU Football. You'll have to clear out more than half of a Dreamcast VMU to download the program to it (it takes up 111 blocks of the unit), and once you've played the game in action, you'll more than likely want to clear out that 111 blocks for something a little more worthwhile. And finding something better than this isn't going to be hard to do. Features Two player alternate 111 blocks Download the game at https://www.dreamcast.com Only for Dreamcast VMU  Look, I'm not going to lie to you  I don't expect the Dreamcast VMU to be this awesome powerhouse for portable gaming. The unit was created for the basic necessities to keep costs down, and the screen just can't keep up with the detailed LCD screens of the Game Boy or other handhelds.  That said, even with the unit's limitations this game is really pathetic. What Sega tried to do was mimic the type of football game that handheld gamers played two decades ago. You might remember them -- they were LED portables from Mattel Electronics, red lights that represented the players, and you maneuver the one red light down the field.  The game is extremely simplistic, but at the same time initially very confusing. You control a ball and march down the field as far as you can go without running into defensive men. There are three tracks you can take: left, center, and right, and there's usually a defensive man occuping each of these routes. What you have to do is wait until there's an opening, rush down the field, and switch lanes when you see another defensive man in your way.  Each push forward on the pad equals one yard of rushing. Every ten yards is a first down. Get to the endzone within four downs, and it's a touchdown (from what I can tell, the automatic point attempts never fail).    On fourth down, you can opt to kick the ball back down the field  if you're within the fifty yard mark, the punt turns into a field goal attempt. It's all about timing the powerbar as close to the prime target as possible.  The graphics take place in an on-the-field perspective, and the defensive men are redrawn at four different sizes to mimic the effect of them getting closer. In the game's favor, the graphics are very detailed and smoothly animated, and easily the best part of VMU Football. But that's not exactly saying much, considering the rest of the game just plain stinks.  There are two problems with the game: first, the Dreamcast VMU's control pad is just terrible. When you want to go up, it many times registers as a right or left  a fatal move for a game like this where there are only three directions to go. Second  the rules are not very clear. It took me a half-hour to realize that you actually have to wait for the defensive men to move out of your way before you can advance the ball. Hey  you get what you pay for. Which is nothing but the time it takes to download the game to your VMU  at most, two minutes. What's better, it only takes an instant to delete this piece o' crap from your unit.", "date": "Oct 2, 1999"}
