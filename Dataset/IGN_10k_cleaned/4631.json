First Star's evergreen puzzler first stormed the gaming scene all the way back in 1984, when it was a colossal hit on the Commodore 64. The game has found homes throughout the years on the NES, Amiga, arcades, and Game Boy. And now the gaming cockroach has found its way into your pocket.   Where we predict it will stay.   Features:  16 puzzles  Screen-rotation   Boulder Dash ME (Mobile Edition) is a solid take on the venerable classic. The goal of the game is the same as it ever was: Guide Rockford through a network of caves, collecting treasure while avoiding falling boulders. Gravity continues to be your worst enemy, as one false move can bring the ceiling crashing down.   Now, some things have changed since the C64's reign of glory. For starts, the game is a lot more colorful. But beyond the visuals, the real meat of the upgrade comes in the game play. Boulder Dash ME feels a lot more dangerous than previous chapters -- there seems to be greater ways to die.   Of course, you must always keep your eyes on the boulders. Should you dig through the dirt below them, they will come thundering down. And since they are round-bottomed, if you leave two vertical spaces on one side empty, the boulder will roll in that direction -- right down on your head. You're going to have to think fast, because not only must you worry about the rocks, but there is a time limit to each maze. You don't have many spare seconds to contemplate a plan of attack.   In addition to boulders, Rockford also has to worry about strategically placed bombs in later levels. Should you dig around the bombs and they come down, they explode. Get caught in the blast radius, and that's all she wrote. There are also butterflies combing the caverns that must be avoided, or squashed with boulders.   Rockford has a few tricks up his own sleeve, though. Not only does he have a boulder-bashing sledge hammer, but he can also rotate the screen ninety-degrees. This will often roll away boulders so treasure can be attained.  If some games age better than others, then Boulder Dash ME is a graceful diva that doesn't understand the words ~twilight stage.~ Rockford's plight is still as addictive as ever. Sixteen mazes doesn't really sound like a lot, but considering the steadily increasing difficulty, you'll certainly squeeze your few bucks worth of game play out of the last set of levels. Boulder Dash ME deserves your download dollars.", "date": "Apr 8, 2004"}
