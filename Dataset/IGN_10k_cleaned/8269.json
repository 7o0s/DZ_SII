In fact, some of them were so amazingly basic, that it was borderline robbery for gamers, and the fanbase started noticing.  These Wii-makes - despite the shiny new Wii logo - have been largely ignored by the market thus far, as it seems that gamers are getting wise to publisher ploys.  Wii-makes won't be tolerated, and so publishers have learned to evolve business plans because of it.  More unique Wii titles are announced each week, as companies like EA and Konami embrace the new system's philosophy.     It's ironic then, that a company with so much original content at Wii's launch is now falling back on Wii-make support.  Ubisoft kicked Wii's launch off with Red Steel and Rayman Ravin Rabbids, two Wii-exclusive titles that - if nothing else - showed off new and unique ways to play games, and they were fun.  Now that we're diving into the post-launch months, however, it's nothing but Wii-makes and rehashed product, as Blazing Angels joins the likes of TMNT, Splinter Cell, Far Cry, and Open Season as games that just aren't trying.     With Blazing Angels, the lack of effort is truly painful for the Wii library.  The Wii controller could be a great asset to flying games, and without a single flagship title that really drives home the entertainment value of flight games, Blazing Angels had potential to set standards.  Instead, players are given painful visuals, wonky controls, and an overall weak port of the original franchise which released on Xbox exactly one year ago.  The game offers the same modes and campaign missions as the original Blazing Angels, so we'll focus more on the Wii version specifics.  If you're looking for a synopsis of the missions (or just want an alternative way to play Blazing Angels), check out our original review right here.   Dogfighting can still be fun, but it's also less precise. What Blazing Angels does bring to the table for Wii is a few different control options for players to try out for themselves.  If nothing else, the game makes some decent innovation as to how a flying game could be played, though the overall execution is just lacking.  Blazing Angels puts you in the cockpit of dozens of different WWII planes, each with their own handling abilities, in-air strengths, and painful weaknesses.  To pull off in-air maneuvers, players can opt to use the Wii-mote stand-alone in its classic NES position, or pair up the controller with the nunchuk for multiple other options.  The Wii-mote mode works decently, but with as many buttons as Blazing Angels requires it's just a bit too cluttered, and we found ourselves constantly re-positioning our hands to make use of tilt, twist, and all major buttons.     For the two-handed control, Ubisoft included the ability to control the planes with either Wii-mote or nunchuk tilt, using the other for AI commands, extra buttons, and air speed, but not for motion control.  The only motion control in the entire game - be it main game or interface - is found in the single tilting plane control.  No IR aiming or menu interface, no rumble in the controllers, no Wii-mote speaker support.  One tilt for plane control, period.   Still, that'd be fine if it wasn't for the weaker execution that comes with adapting Wii controls onto analog actions straight-away.  After all, Wing Island makes use of a single tilt for flight, and the actual in-air maneuverability is decent (despite the end result for the game itself).  Where Blazing Angels actually becomes a sub-par flight game is through the tilt responsiveness, as the controls seem to be mapped directly to the pre-existing analog sensitivity.  The farther you tilt, the harder the plane banks, with a totally vertical (or horizontal, depending on control scheme) pitch being the max turning angle.     Where things get tricky, however, is that the Wii controller actually loses its sense when turned too far, defaulting to straight up/down again.  This means that any time a hard turn is made, over-exaggeration of the turn actually results in no turn at all, and with the sheer amount of movement that needs to happen during a dogfight it's bound to happen more often than it should.  There's no way to change the tilt sensitivity either, so while some planes will have naturally faster pitch control there's still no way to tweak just how much tilt is needed to pull off aerial control.  Team that with naturally slower planes (technology during WWII was all-but amazing), and you've got a game that plays and moves far too sluggishly for its own good.  From what weve played of Blazing Angels previous to the Wii version, the franchise simply has room to grow across the board.  Mix in quickly-ported flight control with PS2 graphics (plus a few stronger blur effects), an otherwise solid presentation of the World War II era, and youve got a game that had a ton of potential, but just didnt execute well.  The missions arent extremely varied in their design, as youll mostly be shooting and bombing the closest target or flying to on-screen waypoints, but solid control goes a long way, and its a double-edged sword when it doesnt execute well.  Theres definite potential for a Wii flight game, and Blazing Angels is a solid candidate, but itll take a true Wii sequel to make it work, rather than a fast fix to a previously-released game; especially when the starting point was passable at best on other consoles.", "date": "Mar 23, 2007"}
