Most of his books contained a core message, but first and foremost his books were wild, inventive and creative. Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat for the GBA, based more off the film in theaters now than that landmark 1950's book gets about half the cat's spirit, crafting a colorful, cheery, wild world but losing most of the wit and invention of the source material. Features: Unlockable bonus content from the film 16 wild levels full of unique Seussian characters Cartridge save (three slots)  Published by Vivendi Universal Games, Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat is  something we've all come to be quite familiar with: a videogame based on a movie, and usually rushed to launch the same weekend as the movie. More often than not, these hasty tie-ins produce unoriginal, unpolished games  created to sell almost exclusively off what's on their cover. This game, developed by hit-and-misser's Digital Eclipse follows the cat's adventures  through various wild platforming stages, where he must capture up all the floating objects and kill off (ok ok, he actually just puts them in a bubble and pops it, but still isn't that kinda mean?) all of the wandering creatures he encounters. On the next level he has to round up all of the floating objects and get rid of the creatures. And on the next level he...has to round up all the...the game gets dull pretty fast. It also has one of my pet peeves in games, which is an energy meter that's displayed through an object instead of a standard meter or number. It's not incredibly  difficult to count the rings on the hat to discern your remaining energy, but it doesn't make it easier on the player.  Digital Eclipse has its share of masterpieces and stinkers, and Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat lands right about in the middle. It's a colorful, cheery little world they've created but unfortunately, what you're doing for 90% of the time amounts to a big pile of fetch quests. With no instruction on level goals, I happily sped through the level, bouncing and floating with my umbrella, enjoying the experience. However upon reaching a dead end, it became apparent that every floating object, which vary from level to level, had to be rounded up to move on. Sigh...so I went back to do this. The end, right? No, now you have to go get rid of all the creatures ambling around  the level. So I did that, too. Phew, level's over, correct? No, now you have to trek back up to that dead end you were at before and hop into the warp hole.  The gameplay is tedious at best. There is nothing clever about this game, it's all a matter of grabbing or bopping everything you see, then entering a new level to do it again. What was so fascinating about the original book by Dr. Seuss, and in fact all his work was that everything tied together so well, and while the reader was hit with a barrage of crazy imagery and poetry, it was always presented in very clever ways. And that's what this game is missing: something clever. Something to do. It boils down to an hour or two of fetch quests, mixed in with a driving sequence and some cinema shots. Unlike many licensed titles, this game does seem to be polished and generally bug-free, there's just not a whole lot going on, and that's particularly a shame when the developers are the same bunch who turned out last year's Disney's Lilo & Stitch, a GBA game that not only did its license justice, but also sported a wide array of gameplay styles and  throwbacks that could probably have held up the title even without the  Disney characters.  The graphics in Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat are pretty solid. Everything is bright, colorful and oversized; You might feel as if you've been shrunk and placed in some rich kid's toy box. Sprite animation is detailed and has personality, and a few of the creatures you'll encounter (and destroy) really capture the look and flow of Seuss' original art to a T. However, many of the levels have somewhat of a mushy look to them, and lack definition, as if they were hastily whipped up, sometimes more like the sketch of what a level might be than a level itself. This is all nitpicking from an adult gamer's point of view (your eight year old will be delighted with the look of the game) but it must be said that the ideas and colors are better done than the details themselves.  The sound comes off well enough, with able sound effects and some jazzy, although heavily repeated tunes. And presentation is a mixed bag with crisp menus, but such an effort to tie the game into the movie, that it loses a lot of clarity. Reading a screen that says ~Aahhhh!~ under a photo of two bored kids is just silly, and unless you're familiar with the movie, you'll be quickly lost in the transition from this 'intro' to the actual gameplay. Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat is a GBA game that doesn't do much, but as far as a game churned out to approximate a film and its big brother console editions, it doesn't fare too horribly. Little kids who have left the theater and just want to see more of the cat doing goofy stuff will likely dig this title, everyone else should take a pass. It's a fairly dull game with all of its pieces done well enough, there just wasn't much put into this. And as a game on its own, it doesn't hold up too well. Still, the art and sound work well enough, there are no hideous bugs, so it might even be in the top half of the licensed GBA titles out there. But that's really not saying a lot.", "date": "Dec 2, 2003"}
