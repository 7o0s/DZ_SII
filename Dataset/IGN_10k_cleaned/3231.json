Unfortunately, reviews are required to be more than a word long so I'll be forced to string together several hundred of them in an attempt to describe to you, our faithful reader, just how bad this Party is.  Shrek, if you've been living in a cave or were swallowed by a whale, is a popular movie from a couple of years back that told the computer-animated tale of a grumpy ogre living in a fairy tale land wanting nothing more than to be left alone.  Throw in a minute ruler needing a bride, a damsel in distress, a talking donkey, and a message about true love and you've got yourself one dandy of a picture.  And anyone loving the Shrek franchise should simply watch the film again rather than buy this poorly-constructed party version featuring your favorite Shrek characters.  Features  Shrek license... hoorah! Play 30 mini-games Choose one of six Shrek characters 1-4 player split-screen action  Gameplay First, let me assure you there is nothing super about Shrek's Super Party.  In fact, there's very little that's even likable.  Actually, there's really not much of anything likable.  The main mode is essentially a 3D board game featuring a half-dozen different Shrek-inspired locations, including the swamp and castle.  Four players (if you have less than four, the rest are controlled by the computer) choose one of six Shrek characters (Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona, Lord Farquaad, Monsieur Hood, Thelonious the executioner) and try and score the requisite points before the others.  Points come in the form of bug juice, which is earned by traveling the board and competing in various competitions.    Moving around the board, each player will land on a variety of different squares.  Some have you stealing bug juice from another player, or challenging a player to duel, or taking everyone on in a no-holds barred challenge.  Sounds fun, I admit, but it's horrendously droll, boring, and terribly executed.  The 30 mini-games that make up duels and challenges are challenging only to those with a low-end IQ, the kind of folk who need someone to dab drool from their chin.  One challenge has you trying to blow bees off a flower by farting on them.  Of course, your competitors are also trying to fart on them, leading to a rarely heard video game remark, ~That's my bee you're farting on!~  Other challenges are equally bizarre and uninteresting, including several different races where you merely move your character left and right and jump.  Who knew there would be a game that could make Rayman Arena look like a Van Gogh.    As boring and pedantic as Shrek Super Party may be, it's not nearly the train wreck of Nickelodeon Party Blast.  Technically it doesn't have any real problems other than some bad clipping.  You can play the mini-games without ripping your hair out in frustration or confusion, but you sure won't have any fun doing it.  Shrek Super Party is the sure-fire party killer, best reserved for the moment you want to clear the house of unwanted guests or perhaps as a cure offered a chronic insomniac.  And please, save your belief this game is for kids and is therefore somehow better than described here.  Shrek allows for a variety of bug swaps that somehow create a variety of more valuable combinations.  This is fine, but it's too complex for kids, so even if (somehow) a child were to actually love the mini-games, they'd still have the door slammed on their face with the bug collecting options.  Graphics Shrek is well-recreated with arenas that somewhat mirror its movie counterpart.  You can tell Shrek from Farquaad, which is at least a solid accomplishment.  Each character comes with a big head, which I hear the kids love (though a few may be equally frightened and terrified by the lack of proportion).  Textures are blurry and poor, the game moves slow, doesn't offer nearly the bright and varied color palette it should, and hardly attempts to tap the power of the system.  Sound A nice narrator voice, but no other voices in the game.  What gives??  Sound effects are incredibly weak and the score is poor and sparse.  Better to simply turn the sound off and make your own effects and obnoxious commentary, because there's nothing here worth listening to.Do not pass go, head directly to jail.  It's bad.  Boring.  And also bad.  When will someone nail party games?  Who knows, but it isn't happening this year.  If you don't care for Shrek, don't even bother looking at the box at your local Ma and Pa video rental shop.  If you love Shrek, spare yourself this pain and avert your eyes from this sin.", "date": "Nov 19, 2002"}
