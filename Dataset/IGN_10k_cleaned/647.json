The company's most celebrated series is undoubtedly Final Fantasy, as it's the best-selling role-playing game series worldwide.   Some cynics don't believe that the Final Fantasy series deserves its lofty status, but the truth is that the Final Fantasy games have continued to set the standard for graphical and musical excellent in the RPG genre. Additionally, the FF games are well known for storytelling that transcends the genre and deep and involving gameplay.    This is what's so disheartening about Chocobo's Dungeon 2, Square's latest attempt to try and milk the success of the Final Fantasy franchise on the PlayStation.  CD2 is a very simplistic dungeon adventure that fails to make use of Square's sensational storywriters or ingenious game designers.  Gameplay The game features randomly generated dungeons and characters from the Final Fantasy series. The game's hero is none other than the extremely cute chicken-like character, Chocobo. Throughout the game, other characters from the Final Fantasy world will accompany little Chocobo on his adventure, such as Mog, the most popular of the Moogles, and Cid.   While some Final Fantasy fans may be happy to see some of their favorite characters featured in the game, I found it to be a blatant attempt to try and abuse the FF franchise, without making any real effort at developing the characters in a realistic fashion.   The central theme of the game is pretty much exploring dungeons, collecting treasures, and killing enemies. The dungeons are randomly generated; hence the game's replay value is potentially limitless because no two games will ever be exactly alike.   The downer is the fact that the random dungeons don't really offer that much in variety as the floors all seem to look very similar and the designs are rather boring. The player would be served much better by having individually created dungeons. The game would no longer have the selling point of no two games every being the same, but it would easily make up for it with skillfully designed dungeon layouts. I, for one, would rather play through well-designed dungeons that feature creative layouts than these boring and repetitive random ones.   The fights in the game are done in a simulated realtime manner. Everything happens onscreen in a style similar to action/RPGs, but there's a sort of turn-based scheme for the actual fighting. Chocobo or any of his sidekicks can attack in eight directions, but trying to quickly get off precise diagonal attacks prove to be a major pain I the butt.   With the game designed with younger gamers in mind, the horrid control isn't something that should be taken lightly. Some companies may think that younger gamers mean dumber gamers, but the reality is that older gamers can probably learn something from their adolescent brethren, as a few can play games with the best of them.   The deepest aspect of Chocobo's Dungeon 2 lies with its treasures and items. There are hundreds of different items to be found, including magic books, potions, tonics, essences, and cards. Individual items in each of these categories can be used for things like restoring hit points or raising magic levels. And, different items can be combined with others to make more powerful objects, such as new custom weapons, items, or armor.   While this does help make Chocobo's Dungeon 2 a very deep game, it doesn't save the game from mediocrity. The truth is that even with the ability to combine items in numerous imaginative ways, it doesn't add anything to the game's level of fun. Whether a intermediate gamer or an advanced one, as I typically pretend to be, playing all the way through Chocobo 2 is more of a chore than an enjoyable gaming experience.    Graphics Square is renowned for making some of the most graphically impressive games on the system. Looking at games like Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VIII, Chrono Cross, and Parasite Eve II, it's obvious as to why the company has earned this reputation.   While Chocobo's Dungeon 2 won't impress players as much as the other games just mentioned, it still stands as a very visually appealing game. The randomly generated dungeons are rather boring in design, but they feature some nicely rendered background objects. Additionally, Chocobo's Dungeon 2 boasts some striking spell effects that sometimes fill up the entire screen.   The most important piece of the graphic pie is undoubtedly the game's character models. The CG character models for Chocobo, the sidekicks, and all of the game's enemy creatures are all superbly modeled and excessively cute. The exceedingly cute critters will indubitably wow younger gamers who just happen to be the target audience for this title.   Sound The soundtrack in Chocobo's Dungeon 2 is comprised of various chirpy tunes that sound similar to what you'd find on a Super NES game. The same thing can be said about the game's various sound effects, too. This is definitely not a game for hardcore RPG fans. It lacks just about every feature that is important in a masterful role-playing experience. However, Square didn't intend this game for that audience and it probably should be judged for what the type of game it was planned to be. With that said, younger gamers will certainly be enamored with the super-cute Chocobo and its supporting cast. On the other hand, the game does have some design and control issues that can't be ignored and may turn off even the younger gamers.", "date": "Jan 25, 2000"}
