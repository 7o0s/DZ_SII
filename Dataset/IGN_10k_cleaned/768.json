One being a strong sense of dedication to quality and innovation, and the other being some of the fruitiest, most unbelievably quirky games I have ever seen.  As much as I am excited by the former, I am equally bewildered by some of the latter in ways I can't really put in to words.  Unless you've seen the likes of Pen Pen and Vib Ribbon in motion, it may not make sense to you, but trust me, some of this stuff is just plain odd.  Now, prior to last fall, I had always assumed that when I bagged on goofy games, Sonic Team would never even enter into the discussion.  That was until I saw Chu Chu Rocket at TGS.  I wasn't quite sure what happened there, but I would have sworn someone went off the deep end.  I mean, have you guys seen the commercial for this game?  I can see the advertising now: ~From the people who brought you Sonic the Hedghog and NiGHTS comes.....lots and lots of MICE!~  Suuuuure.  Normally, I'd look at a game like this, laugh, and pass it on to one of my more fru...er...import-savvy editors, but hey, this is a Sonic Team game, and these guys haven't let me down yet. Plus you throw in the fact that it's the first Internet-ready Dreamcast game, and I decided it was sort of my civic duty to suffer through the wackiness and see what this game was all about.  I owed you guys at least that much, I figured.  So anyways, I popped it out of the case and prepared for sensory overload...and I got it, alright...just not in the way I expected.  Turns out this kooky little title is a really solid puzzler, and one of the best multi-player games we've ever played.  The tricky part wasn't picking up on this, however, it was actually just figuring out how to play it.  Because of this puzzler's nutty exterior and the unbelievably quick pace, it will make even the most season gamer go ~Huh!?!?!?~ at least once.  I'm not gonna repeat the instruction book for you, but the basic gist is that you try to direct a bunch of speed-happy meeces in little rockets so they can escape.  Known as ChuChus, these little guys are afraid of the KapuKapus (or cats), and the game surrounds the idea of getting them to safety.  Of course, as soon as you start playing, all this stuff goes out the window, as it quickly becomes a blur of arrows, mice, and trash-talk. Yeah, there are five different distinct modes to Chu Chu but, in truth, this game is all about multi-player insanity, especially in the form of screwing over your buddies at every possible opportunity.   I suppose each mode has it's own charm, but trust me, even if you play against the computer, you'll soon forget about the puzzle and stage modes in favor of a little head-to-head action.  This is primarily due to the insane pace this game keeps up, and though the learning curve seems stiff, once you get past it, you'll find that this game can go toe-to-toe with the likes of Bomberman and Poy Poy any day of the week.  Forget calling Chu Chu the best Dreamcast multi-player title. It is quite simply the best multi-player effort we've played in years, on any console.  Because of the way the game is set-up, tons of last minute saves and steals are possible with EVERY match, and we've seen more than one match finish with a skilled mouse-herder going from worst-to-first in a matter of seconds by a few quick re-directs of some hungry cats towards the leader.  It is totally frantic, and totally fun.   It sounds great and all, but I am sure that by now you guys are all stuck with one major question: How will all of this chaos translate onto the Internet?  Thankfully, the answer regarding Sega's first real test is a resounding (in my best ~Antonio Banderas as Zorro~ voice) ~Not bad.  Not bad at all.~ The game would be perfect in this regard were it not for a very poorly conceived match-making server, that is basically a straight jump from the Japanese version.  Not to knock Sonic Team, but this thing is about as intuitive as fish riding a bicycle.  It is just really under-developed, and lack basic features found in all major match-making clients, and as a hardcore Net gamer, I am a little depressed to see Sega's first step be so awkward, especially when it could have been fixed so easily.  As it stands now, there just isn't enough distinction geographically between players, games, and rooms, and the server is not very conducive to easy transitions between chat and gaming, which makes finding and playing your friends a bit too tricky.  Ah well.  Hopefully practice will make perfect.  The good news is, if you can get around the god-awful, painfully lengthy log-on, poorly organized gaming lobby, and another evil problem, the game itself is actually still playable, and more importantly, quite enjoyable.  The main thing that keeps it from being the be all and end all is (you might want to hold on to something, 'Net addicts): The lag.  Yes, lag.  The dirtiest word under five letters in any 'Net gamer's vocabulary.  I don't care how little was changed from the Japanese version or how the game was set up, the fact that there is a 200+ ping on every game of Chu Chu I play is really kind of sad.  By Sega's own admission, this game is not that intense from a bandwidth standpoint, and I was more than a tad pissed when I first experienced the delay between me pushing buttons and actually placing my arrows.   I'm sure you're wondering how you keep playing despite this, as the game is completely based in split-second decisions.  Well, basically, you have to plan your arrow-drops a good four spaces ahead of the game.  It changes the gameplay dynamic considerably, but once you get into the game, it honestly becomes second nature.  Instead of making the mice go in one way, you use a wall and re-direct them until you can place another, more appropriate arrow.  It sucks that you have to make up for the game's code's (and your connection's) lack of efficiency in this regard, but trust me, it is still VERY playable, and it is still an awesome experience.  This is due to the game's elegantly simplistic control, which makes thing thinking fast (or slow, as the case may be) a little easier, and everything just feels right.  CCR is so simple that anyone, from the hardest of the hardcore right down to the greenest non-gamer can pick this game up and start having fun after a few quick rounds.  This game is so cute and enjoyable, that it will be really hard for anyone not to like it if they give it a chance.  Granted, there are some instances in Online play where you get completely screwed, as the game simply cannot be played on as high a level of twitch-based mayhem as it can with all four players in one room, such as when a ~Cat Mania~ follows a bit too loosely on the heels of ~Mouse Mania.~  But, as long as you accept this to some degree, you'll find it is almost as fun as a non-Internet game.  The fact is, this is often the case for any 'Net game when we're talking about the difference between the 'Net and a LAN, so I guess it all balances out in the end.  The same could be said of the game's visuals.  CCR was designed with simplicity in mind, and unlike Sonic Team's jaw-dropping artwork in Sonic Adventure, you're not going to initially think to much of this game. Once you're in a game and about 100 or so ChuChus are flying this way and that, you will probably begin to see why they took this minimalist approach. Despite its lack of detail, the game gets its point across graphically as well as any other on Dreamcast, and that is to make you feel like you're in way over your head.    That's the thing about Chu Chu Rocket.  When you first see it, you will be completely underwhelmed in some senses, and totally overwhelmed in others.  But, as soon as you actually dive in and start playing, you'll be completely blown away.  It's fast, it's fun, and it's the type of game you simply have to have at a party.  The four-player rocks quite hard, and when you throw in all the other modes and the fact that the DC's first Internet game is also selling at the paycheck-friendly price of $29.99, this truly is a hard game to pass up. But harbor no illusions.  This is not exactly Internet gaming at its finest.  It is, however, a pretty good first run for Sega, and will be worth the money if you're not too picky about that sort of thing. So my advice to you after this rant? Go grab a copy, blow the dust off your DC modem and prepare to get beat down by yours truly on the Dreamcast Network. I'll be the one sending Cats to your rocket.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 8, 2000"}
