And with the awesome link option, Command & Conquer: Red Alert has definitely taken realtime strategies to a much better level.  Laced with the original, speaker-busting soundtrack, Command & Conquer: Red Alert comes complete with all the missions of the PC version, all the units, and it's mouse compatible too. So no more thumb calluses.  But perhaps one of the best features that this game possesses is the link cable. Not only can you enjoy a skirmish with some AI dolts, but now, you can go head to head with your buddy. Brilliant!  The gameplay is true to its PC counterpart, moving exceptionally fast and possessing a very user-friendly interface. In fact, the only complaint I have is that the game is too hard... but maybe that's because I suck.  All in all, this blows away any real-time strategy game out there on the PlayStation and I recommend it to anyone who has even the most minute love for real-time strategy titles.
