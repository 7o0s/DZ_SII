By taking the basic concepts of most hardcore wargames and placing them in a more familiar RTS style of play, they've managed to bridge the gap between the merciless realism and authenticity of games like Combat Mission and the point and click approachability of games like Command & Conquer. But while the series has carved out a respectable place within the RTS genre, it's facing tougher and tougher competition lately from more innovative and exciting games like Company of Heroes and Supreme Commander.  Witness the latest iteration of the series, Frontline: Fields of Thunder. Though it doesn't carry the actual title (and is published by Paradox Interactive rather than CDV), this is a Blitzkrieg game through and through. The same gritty realism, the same overly challenging but predictable missions, and the same limited reinforcement models are all carried right through to Frontline. While there are a few improvements worth noticing and some undeniably fun moments here and there, Frontline feels like it's holding on too tightly to the traditions and conventions that characterized wargame RTS games since the days of Sudden Strike.   The one thing that Frontline gets absolutely right is the setting. Rather than relying on the old warhorses of the European Theater, Frontline models the Battle of Kursk. You can hardly go wrong by simulating history's largest tank battle between combatants known by reputation as excellent tank tacticians. One campaign features the Germans, the other the Soviets so players will get to take charge of attacks and defenses on both sides of the conflict. The only real frustration here is that these German and Soviet tank match-ups are very similar to those presented in Nival's latest Blitzkrieg expansion, Fall of the Reich. As with Fall of the Reich, the campaign here is supplemented by a number of one-off missions and a single mode for multiplayer.  Frontline puts players in charge of a small combined arms force. Leading infantry, artillery, AT guns, supply trucks and tanks (mostly tanks) through the countryside and cities of the Eastern Front, you'll be presented with a variety of obstacles, from taking out enemy emplacements to defending towns from capture. In all, the missions play out very much like those in Blitzkrieg. Each objective is defended by a few rows of AT guns and infantry trenches backed up by a handful of tanks. You'll have to engage the enemy in a way that minimizes your own losses while still giving you the best chance for a quick victory.  Shepherding your forces through each encounter with the enemy and preserving their effectiveness is the main goal here because, unlike most other RTS games, you can't just pump out new units. And where the Blitzkrieg games let you order reinforcements according to your own needs and schedule, Frontline doles out reinforcements only after you complete certain scripted objectives. Fortunately, the scripted reinforcements are relatively balanced so you won't be leading just tanks by the end of a mission.   The friendly AI frequently relies on your direct intervention to keep your units alive. While we certainly don't mind having to tell units where to go and what to do, having to ensure that units actually fire at the targets we've designated is going too far. Several times during the course of the game, you'll have to watch in horror as your units advance to point blank range before deciding to fire on the enemy you've selected. We've seen four or five of our tanks swarm around an enemy AT gun like they wanted to get his autograph. On the other side, enemy units seem content to advance into the worst kinds of danger, even after the first half of their column has been demolished.  In keeping with the Blitzkrieg model, Frontline is ridiculously difficult for reasons other than the AI. While we're sure that the hardcore fans will tent their fingers at this statement and smugly assume that we must suck at the game, it's not the level of the challenge that aggravates us but rather its overall character. Instead of presenting players with a flexible AI opponent or an opportunity to use mobility to outmaneuver the enemy, the designers simply offer up a succession of fortified towns and trenches that must be overcome by pure force and careful observation of your units' ranges.      Missions of this sort show the difference between a designer who's interested in providing compelling challenges to the player and one who's merely interesting in beating him. The former provides a playground for you to exercise your tactical muscles, while the latter essentially dares you to complete your objectives. It's not that there aren't individually interesting moments here and there during the missions, but the overall design seems weighted far more towards precision and patience than daring and volatility.  On the other hand, gamers who don't mind the ~save early and often~ trial and error method of advancing through a level will find that their feeling of satisfaction on completing a mission is incredibly high. There are even some enjoyable tricks worth learning when you find yourself approaching yet another frontal assault on a town or trench system. Finding these is more a matter of luck than tactical insight however.   Gamers can make use of an ever-increasing pool of aircraft to support their assaults. Fighters provide cover for your own forces and help to counteract the effectiveness of enemy airpower. If you've got sufficient control of the air (and little to worry about from AA guns on the ground), you can send scout planes, bombers and ground attack planes into the skies to help find your way through an enemy's defenses. Since it's the only type of reinforcement that isn't completely dependent on the completion of objectives, you'll find yourself using it quite a bit to tip the scales in your favor.  It's starting to show its age but the graphics engine is definitely still capable of rendering interesting and exciting battle scenes. Seeing your tanks flattening trees and houses as they make their way towards the enemy is a nice touch. (Although it is odd that running over a house can sometimes cause it to burst into flame.) Seeing a small puff of smoke from just within the tree line of a nearby forest alerts you to danger just seconds before you see your own vehicles erupt in gouts of flame and smoke. The charred husks they leave behind and the small pockmarks on the ground from the few shells that didn't hit you really brings the whole experience of battle to life and serve as an excellent reminder of where the hotspots were earlier in the mission.  The wealth of detail on the environmental objects and units is great. Tanks have great animations to go along with firing or moving and the camera lets you get (nearly) as close to the action as you want. Infantry fare a bit worse at this scale, taking on a rather blocky sort of appearance. The wide range of trucks, houses, bridges, fences and the like that are spread throughout the map gives the entire map a strong sense of place. Unfortunately, the textures are a bit grainy and the poly count leaves a bit to be desired.   The sounds in Frontline manage to get the job done but don't stand out as particularly impressive. As with the Blitzkrieg games, there's a suitably martial score that highlights and reinforces the action, but the overall sounds of the battle seem a bit thin by comparison.  Finally, Frontline comes with a comprehensive encyclopedia of all the units featured in the game. For fans of military history, it's a great resource to learn more about the tools that each side used in the conflict. It can also help you spot operational weaknesses in some of the hardware you're using.Ultimately, we're not convinced gamers need two Soviet-versus-German tactical tank games in one season, let alone two from the same developer. Being released so closely together it seems like Fall of the Reich and Frontline are offering exactly the same experience to exactly the same group of WW2 RTS fans. Picking one or the other is largely a matter of availability rather than quality.In any case, the unforgiving nature of the game coupled with the predictable mission design makes Frontline more a cause of frustration than an exercise for your tactical skills. Allowing gamers to take part in the Battle of Kursk is definitely a point in the game's favor but it's the only aspect of the game that feels particularly unique or enjoyable. The rest is a by-the-numbers RTS that won't surprise anyone.", "date": "Apr 3, 2007"}
