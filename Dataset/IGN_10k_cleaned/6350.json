In the case of the Bible Game, from Crave Entertainment, it comes in the shape of whales, arks, lions and Philistines. The title should be enough to distance anyone without Christian convictions, but for church-going folk it's actually not that bad. Heck, it's also a decent buy for parents looking for sanctioned games to buy their kids. This isn't to say the Bible Game is great, regardless of your religious preferences, but it offers more than Bible trivia for those who want a little meat to go along with their Old Testament quiz.  The Bible Game splits between to main game modes, TV Game Show and Challenge Games. To start, 20 mini-games make up the Challenge Games mode. Each challenge draws from a Biblical event or story, albeit very loosely. In fact, most mini-games border on self-parody. It feels as though developers designed each mini-game, then turned to the Bible to find what, exactly, they could stuff into each to make them ~Biblical~ enough for religious audiences. The result, as previously mentioned, looks and sounds somewhat shady.   Take the David and Goliath mini-game, for instance. The biblical story focuses on the role of faith when facing seemingly impossible odds. The mini-game, though, has no such lesson. And if it weren't for the name, you wouldn't find any connection with the mini-game and the biblical story at all. Instead, it's just an action exercise where you shoot rocks at Philistines in a very ~shooting range~ style environment. Then again, if you don't really care about the biblical angle, it may be fun for young kids.   Then there's the Red Sea mini-game, where you need to run through the parted sea while dodging obstacles. Again, there's no real connection to the bible. There's not even a passing mention of Moses, the Ten Commandments or the degree of a faith it took for a Shepard to lead a revolt against the Egyptian Empire. Again, the biblical tale has been stripped of all its potency. The highlight of the Red Sea mini-game is actually dodging crabs and rocks while trying not to get sucked into the ocean. There's also Pharaoh's army to consider, which a line of spears at the bottom of the page represents. Again, it's fun for kids, but parents looking for religious depth won't find it here.    Every mini-game here follows the same basic formula. Whether it's trapping lions in Lion's Den, blasting demons in Angels and Devils or throwing false idols into pits of fire in False Idols, there's not much bible learning. Sure, the game includes 20 different mini-games, all of which offer a decent amount of fun and four-player compatability, but none offers anything new. You've seen every one of these games (in one form or another) many times before in other titles. Having said that, each controls well and doesn't have anything particularly wrong with it; just don't expect to innovative gameplay.       The second portion of the Bible Game, the TV Game Show, offers some 1,500 questions on the Old Testament. Since it's a game show, you can choose to play as one of six different cartoon-like personas. There's an energetic host, a game board and Jeopardy-like set. Questions are pretty good and offer a nice range of easy, intermediate and difficult bible trivia. The easy questions typically quiz you on the most popular biblical stories such as the Exodus or David's confrontation with Goliath. The more difficult questions get pretty obscure, so even those well-versed in, er, verses, will find them challenging.   In addition to the questions, a number of squares trigger mini-games and, if you're unlucky, the ~wrath of God~ in which case the game strips you of your points. Boy, there's nothing like randomly triggering the wrath of God to get you excited about the Bible. Again, it's hard to separate the hokum from the substance. Try explaining to your kids why God grew angry with them and, for no good reason at all, decided to smite them with thunder, locust and frogs and, more importantly, took all their points away. Bad news, folks.    And thats the main problem with the Bible Game. Theres not enough biblical depth to warrant a purchase from religious folk, yet the mini-games arent that engaging, either. It all feels somewhat hokey as well; almost as though youre playing a game that Ned Flanders would buy for his kids. But if youre looking for a collection of non-violent mini-games that kids will enjoy then you could definitely do worse, especially considering the 20 dollar price tag. Plus, theres a nice collection of Christian tunes from contemporary artists, so fans of these bands will definitely take notice.", "date": "Nov 15, 2005"}
