The graphics are superb, the on the field game is fun despite a few problems, and there are some nice extra options like a play editor and a playoff tournament. This is offset by a lack of off-the-field options, as we'll see, but altogether it's a good package and a great arcade football game, almost like a console game. And at a price of $20, it can't be beat.  I had little trouble getting the game up and running except for some hiccups with my Voodoo 3 card, but once that was sorted out getting into the game and exploring the options through the Windows-style interface was a snap. The menus and information presented in each screen are logical and navigation is easily handled with a mouse.  When the game begins the first thing you'll notice are the remarkable graphics. Animations, detail, movement -- it's all there and amazingly breathtaking, and don't ever let anyone tell you graphics don't matter in a sports game. When your team is lined up on the line of scrimmage and the defensive linebackers and creeping in, creeping in, showing blitz and your receiver is in motion and you can read the name on his jersey while the crowd is roaring and you're barking out audibles, oh yes, this is football.   However when it comes to playing the game on the field, a few problems crop up. The passing game is pretty strong, and getting completions isn't all that tough. In fact, you'll find yourself throwing the ball on most downs because conversely, the running game is extraordinarily difficult. Tacklers break through your line like bulldozers and seem to pull off remarkable tackles with only the merest contact with a running back. If you expect to develop a well-rounded offense or play as a strong running team like Tampa Bay, be prepared to invest a lot of time in learning the moves and working on the formations.  The audio for the most part is acceptable and the play by play and color commentary provided by Matt Millen and Dick Stockton is generally on the mark, though the segments where it's been spliced together can be noticeable and like most sports games, the commentary quickly becomes repetitive. Eventually you'll just turn it off. Sound effects for the players hitting and calling audibles are done competently and the crowd noises, while not always in tune with what's going on in the field, are adequate.  However if you're looking for something with more depth and longevity than your typical console game, if you're looking for things like a franchise mode, trading AI, or even week by weak statistics for all the players in the league, you'll have to look elsewhere. NFL Fever is a pretty bare bones game as far as general managers are concerned. What few options there are -- such as creating new plays and making new players -- work fine, but the lack of a draft, trading AI, and utilities for making new teams and leagues is sorely disappointing.  So what football game should you buy for your PC this year? With Accolade, Sierra and 989 Sports sitting this season out, it basically comes down to two games: this, and Madden NFL 2000. NFL Fever is definitely a better looking game than Madden, probably not as realistic but certainly more enjoyable, and with its unbeatable price -- $20 -- you can afford to give NFL Fever a try. On the other hand if you're absolutely dead set on a franchise mode, career players, and the full experience of being an NFL owner, general manager, and head coach, Madden is your game.  Looking ahead to next season, though, expect NFL Fever 2000 to return with a lot more of the features that didn't make it in this year, as Microsoft has said that this first outing was mainly to get the game engine out and working. Still, all of the PC football games next year will have their work cut out for them competing with the new wave of console football titles.  -- Jason Bates", "date": "Sep 24, 1999"}
