John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland is obviously just an advertisement for John Deere tractors disguised as a Harvest Moon ripoff. Fine, we can deal with that. After all, Cabela's has sponsored tons of hunting/fishing games without beating the brand name over the player's head. The difference is that Cabela's doesn't require the player to travel to an authorized retailer and purchase its products as the only option to progress. It wouldn't be a big deal if the developer made a decent game that's actually fun to play. Unfortunately, Black Lantern Studios made a game that is hardly functional, much less fun.   Harvest in the Heartland is essentially Harvest Moon. That is, it's a game about running a farm. Planting crops, watering, feeding chickens, you know, farm stuff. Players look down from an overhead view and guide their farmer around, completing all the steps required to grow a crop or raise some livestock. It's not as rewarding as actually planting your own vegetables and nurturing them to blue ribbon size, but it has the benefit of being able to raise dozens of cows without the stench that comes with it.   As an American version of Harvest Moon, John Deere has a nice concept. We planted some wheat, watered it, then harvested it for cash. When it's a small farm with only one of two crops, or a few animals the game is actually kind of fun, if not completely unoriginal. There's a town we got to visit to buy stuff, or enter our crops into the county fair, which in turns unlocks little trophies and ribbons. There's even a decent amount of customization with the colors of buildings and player's outfits.   Gameplay varies from destroying trees, to gently caressing udders. Unfortunately Harvest in the Heartland falls apart as soon as the player gets ambitious and really plays. The farm can be expanded, and more crops can be purchased. Since there's not enough time in the day to work on a lot of crops, the helpful John Deere retailer will sell you his merchandise. So now we've got a tractor, a little more land, and a decent amount of crops. That's when the game goes to hell.   John Deere streams its objects, but does such a poor job of it that it takes multiple seconds for some things to load. Walking in from town to find our barn missing was rather startling. Oh wait, there it is. The farther we progressed in the game, the worse it got. Riding our tractor caused such significant slowdown that the game became almost unplayable. Fences, sprinklers, even entire buildings would disappear and reappear constantly. It's not like there's a lot to load. The only thing mentioned that animates are the sprinklers, and they only have a couple frames. The 2D sprites are very basic, so there's not a good excuse for why the game can't seem to handle everything. Plus, it's not like we were getting excessive. This is the normal progression of the game. It's hard to get motivated to build on and expand our farm if the game is acting like it's going to completely die if we do.   Oh, and did we mention the load screens? There sure are a lot of them. When we went to town, there's load screen. Switched tools, another load screen. Paused, load screen there, too. It completely murders the pace of the game.Even if John Deere: Harvest in the Heartland worked perfectly, it would be an uninspired, unattractive game that beats the player over the head with its sponsor. Harvest Moon finally branched out their series, and Harvest in the Heartland is just one big step backwards. However, the game's engine is so poor that is makes John Deere too frustrating and slow to even bother with. Go plant some tomatoes in your garden. Not only will it be more fulfilling, it will probably take less time too.", "date": "Dec 1, 2007"}
