This game is not Gretzky 3D Hockey '97, '98, '99, 2000, or 2001; it's not even part of the Nagano Gretzky Olympic Hockey series. NHL Breakaway '98 is an original hockey simulation from Acclaim for Nintendo 64 -- the first of its kind. The game is developed by Iguana West (based in Utah), the same production house responsible for the upcoming WWF Warzone. And very much like Warzone, NHL Breakaway is betting on realistic graphics and loads of options to catapult ahead of the competition; a very safe bet considering that's exactly what die-hard fans want: realism.  The Facts All 26 NHL teams and more than 600 players from the NHPLA are present  Up-to-date team rosters Season and playoff stat tracking in more than 45 categories The ability to create players (and names do appear on player jerseys) Sign and release free agents Coaching Team scouting reports by Keith Tkachuk Multi-player trades Five gameplay modes: exhibition, season, playoffs, practice and shoot-out mode Teams play their actual game styles Players differ in size on the ice The game is in medium-res mode (though the box claims it to be hi-res) Rumble Pak support Four player simultaneous multiplayer mode Settings can be saved to memory pak Configurable control scheme   Gameplay: Breakaway's gameplay received much tweaking from its prior incarnation on the PlayStation. Like with EA's hockey games, ~sim~ is the name of the game. In response to many gamers' complaints about the slightly too fast speed of the original, Iguana West slowed down the overall speed of the N64 version, making the passing game more playable and helping you keep track of players better. We think the default is now actually a bit too slow -- but thankfully the programmers included an option that enables you to adjust the speed to your liking. Nevertheless, slap shots do feel a bit sluggish, but the good passing game, fantastic multiplayer, and cool player-creation modes more than make up for it.  Arcade hockey fans who liked the Gretzky trilogy will probably be put off by the more realistic plays -- but if you're into hockey, Breakaway offers options and stats like no other game. For example, you can actually change the setup for both forwards and defense players, select players for the faceoff, hire coaches, draft new players, and accumulate bonus points over the season to heal your injured players.  The camera views are also improved from the PlayStation version, with a very playable high and medium cam, an interesting Genesis-like retro cam, and the usual showy (but limiting) on ice cam and side cams. You will probably want to stick to the high cam most of the time, but watching a demo game in the on-ice cam mode is a must.  Graphics: The overall look and presentation of NHL Breakaway goes for realism over graphics glitz. The ice is white (as it should be), colors are muted, players climb into the ice rink and can even lose their helmets or sticks when tackled -- just like in real life. Thanks to some imaginative camera work, you will feel like you're watching an actual hockey game down to the extreme overhead close-up at the faceoff (although the textures do suffer severely in this view). Player models are good with many convincing animations, even if they look a bit stiff sometimes. Since everyone wears a helmet and a mask, you won't notice the generic face texture.   Like in the real sport, players pull off a variety of moves, such as checks and tackles, skate backwards, raise their arms in celebration, get slammed into the boards, or eat the ice head-on.  Although the box proclaims that the game runs in hi-res, it's actually in medium-res -- a safe choice, since even in this mode the framerate is less than solid. As a matter of fact, the shaky framerate, somewhat clunky looking menus and fonts, and some strange warping of the audience textures are the only real downers in the graphics department.  Sound: Breakaway is alive with realistic sound effects, shouts, audience noises and a refreshing absence of recurring ~merry men~ one-liners. As a matter of fact, the announcer is limited to a few, rare comments such as ~please pick up your child~ or ~don't throw stuff on the ice~ announcements in between plays. Music, always a minor part in any sports game, is best characterized as decent techno in full stereo. It's there -- but it won't make people's eyes pop out with amazement. Iguana also included the usual array of organ melodies including some national anthems. It adds an air of authenticity, but you will probably switch it off after a few plays. Overall, the sound is not up to the dolby-surround enhanced quality of EA's offerings, but solid sports-game fare.  Control: Icon-passing lets you direct your shots and target select players. At first, you will be annoyed by the fact that all the icons are yellow (curse that N64 controller), but it works wonderfully once you get used to it. Because of the occasional slowdown, player control is not as responsive as it could be -- but the game excels with many skating options (hold down R to skate backwards) and good goalie control. When compared with the competition on other consoles, NHL Breakaway is definitely not the hockey game to end all hockey games. It's not as good as EA's NHL 98 on the PlayStation and PCs, but it's a much deeper, and longer-lasting experience than the Gretzky games on the N64 (and it includes both NHL and Olympic teams). The detailed graphics (thanks to the increased resolution) make Breakaway one of the better looking sports games on the N64 -- even if it is slightly tarnished by slowdown and doesn't look quite as vibrant as the PSX version. The great passing game and incredible amount of options and gameplay features make for many entertaining sim seasons and engrossing multiplayer battles. A realistic hockey sim that will keep you playing for months -- if you like sports sims.", "date": "Feb 27, 1998"}
