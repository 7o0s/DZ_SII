Activision took a chance publishing this game for the rookie development studio since this game was originally planned for the PlayStation 2, but as you'll see the impressive visuals and downright fun of Wreckless seem very well suited for the Xbox.   The premise behind the game is to re-create the humor and thrills of an over the top Hong Kong action film. To facilitate this, Bunkasha set up probably the most impressive lighting effects we've seen in a game, extremely believable vehicle/environment physics and beautifully grotesque damage effects. All of this in a detailed, living re-creation of Hong Kong that'll make those familiar with the city feel right at home. And for those of us who've never been there, Wreckless makes a nice video tour guide.With all of that marvelous videogame technology at your disposal, though, it's hard not to feel like you're busting up Hong Kong in a way that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker only dreamed of. Plus you don't have to put up with Tucker's limited acting skills.   The story behind Wreckless is actually two stories in one. The A Scenario follows the adventures of two scantily clad Hong Kong police officers, The Flying Dragons, as they attempt to stop an outbreak of organized criminal activity. The Yakuza, the powerful Japanese organized crime syndicate are up to all kinds of shady stuff in Hong Kong. The B Scenario follows Ho and Chang a pair of bumbling wannabe spies who're trying to work their way into the HK underworld. The personalities of these characters come to life through short, punchy cutscenes that have the same kind of tongue-in-cheek humor that makes those action films so endearing. Chang and Ho end up being a lot more fun because of Ho's resemblance to Elton John, plus there's a strange kind of tension between these two that we're not even going to get into here.    The stories intersect in that you'll play the same mission from each duo's perspective. For example the first mission as The Flying Dragons has you chasing down this gang of Yakuza cars that are trying to run this armored truck off the road. When you smash up the Yakuza cars your mission is accomplished and you get a dandy little cut scene. When you play as Chang and Ho you're trying to run the armored truck off the road but you have to avoid the Yakuza cars to do it. You have your own agenda that doesn't involve the cops or the gangsters. When Chang and Ho succeed the storyline takes a decidedly different direction. Also there are other missions where you're competing against a rival in a racing mission or a collect the dim sum stands mission. That rival will usually be the opposite duo from the one you're playing.   Each team has its own set of cars to begin with and they're own slate of unlockable rides as well. The Dragons start off with the adorable little HK cop car that looks like something a meter maid might drive and a yellow and pink dune buggy. Chang and Ho have the classic black HK taxi and super buggy available to them from the get go. They'll unlock new cars in more or less the same order and each will have its counterpart. The Dragons get a super fast red sports car as their first unlockable and Chang and Ho get a kick ass DeLorean for those speed intensive missions.   Physics The physics of the cars and the way they interact with the environment is the key to fun in Wreckless. The buggies bounce and sway with every bump in the road and curb you run up on. But when we talk about interacting with the environment we're talking about damage. In this game, you'll dish out as much damage to the city of Hong Kong as the city will deal back to you. We're not just talking about the city building either, the other motorists in HK have places to go and you're just another driver on the street to them. When you smash into a concrete wall, the wall will be fine but the front end of your ride will crumple considerably. Hit another car head-on, and believe us you will, and your hood will crumple even more. Keep bashing the front end and eventually the hood will pop off entirely. But wait there's more. If you continue to smash the front end of, say, the Fun Buggy, and again you most definitely will, the spare tire will pop out and go rolling down the street. The same theme is continued all over the vehicle. Doors will fly off after enough damage, trunks will pop open and your car will disintegrate piece by piece. BUT, it never completely falls apart and dies. Nor will you notice any differences in performance. Wreckless is intended to be realistic but only to the extent that it's fun and over-the-top. By the end of most missions you'll have no doors, no hood, no trunk and you'll have more dents than a supermarket parking lot.  But the city takes a beating too. Knowing what can be smashed and what can't is part of the thrill in Wreckless. Speeding towards what looks like a bamboo wall in hopes of finding a cleverly disguised shortcut quickly turns to horror when you realize there's a concrete wall on the other side. Whatever mission you're on is definitely going to take longer now that you've gone from 60mph to 0mph in 2 seconds. But you can knockdown pretty  much all of the fencing, portable toilets, phone booths, but stops, utility boxes, dim sum stands and tables you come across and there are plenty of them. And when the stuff breaks it shatters, bends and rattles around with amazing realism. The particle system for flying sparks when you bust up electronic items like neon signs or phone booths is extremely dramatic and bright.  Other than those sure things, you're taking a chance running into stuff. Most statues can be broken but a short little concrete barrier cannot. Similarly you'll simply pass through most lamp posts, trees and bushes as if they're not even there. Bunkasha had to make some decisions on what can be breakable and what couldn't, but it can be a bit frustrating passing through trees when you just tore through a plate glass window and two blocks of fencing.   Gameplay Wreckless was described to us a platformer with cars. While that's an oversimplification your Banjo-Kazooie skills may come in handy when you're not utilizing your Crazy Taxi abilities. Chasing down other vehicles and smashing into them is repackaged and re-purposed in a variety of ways in this game. But as you progress, you'll have to do other things on top of all that hunting and smashing. In fact many components of a mission aren't revealed to you until you've first chased down and smashed and enemy. Then all of a sudden you'll have to race to another part of town to do something else. Also most mission will have some sort of timer to really help keep you on edge.   But when you're not recklessly smashing around downtown Hong Kong there are clever levels that have you practicing your stunt driving abilities or precision driving skills. One level had us attacking a mammoth virtually indestructible dump truck rolling around a construction yard with a hostage strapped to the front of it. After trying to ram the dump truck from every conceivable angle with no effect, we figured out you have to detonate the dozens of explosive barrels he's carrying. Like something out of the classic Blast Corps you have to catch air off some of the hills and hurl your vehicle into the back of the dump truck several times. Of course, after blowing up the truck, you only have a few seconds to make your way to the top of one of the buildings under construction to complete the rest of the mission. Should you fail at any point along the way, you have to start over at the very beginning. It is in this way that Wreckless will get the most out of its limited number of missions. You'll rarely make it through the more difficult missions the first time you try. Some new objective you're not prepared for will pop up just when you think you're done.  Each duo has about 10 missions to complete. The further along you get the more complicated and drawn out the missions become. Plus there's a lot of  trial and error involved in figuring out how to advance past certain obstacles.   If Wreckless has any gameplay drawbacks it's a lack of depth of features. A multiplayer mode was scrapped late in the game's development and there's no custom soundtrack feature in a game that definitely should have one. The replay mode is intriguing because of all of the cool special effects and filters it uses, but gamers have no control to rewind or pause during playback. You can, however, save your replays which is a nice fit with the Xbox's hard drive. This is where your skills as a Hong Kong action star will really pay off.  Graphics Like we said, Wreckless has some of the most outstanding lighting and reflections you'll ever see in a videogame. Sunlight and streetlights all reflect off of the car surfaces even after those surfaces become mangled and bent in every direction. The reflections just become smaller and more detailed. The missions happen at different times of day so you may have the bright afternoon sun overhead, the intense orange glow cutting between the buildings at dusk or the neon highlights of Hong Kong after dark all around you or reflecting off of your vehicle.   For all of the great lighting effects and reflections, Wreckless features superb vehicle animations thanks to all of the stuff that breaks, flaps, hangs off and detaches from the cars. The cars themselves lean and pitch in and out of turns but we can't forget about all of the flips and rolls you'll be doing around town. The out of control animations are the best part about finding those shortcuts.   Likewise, the Xbox has set a standard that can't be ignored going forward with animated drivers that turn steering wheels, lean into turns and bounce around on their seats in time with the action. You can see all of this action much better once the doors of flown off the car you're driving.   The game plays at a steady 30 frames per second but it's clear now that 30fps on the Xbox looks a whole lot better than it did on PSX or N64. The blur effects and camera work with all of its focusing and re-focusing in real time combine for a stylized presentation of the action and the Xbox has no problem keeping up.  Sound The sound in Wreckless is nothing more or less than effective. Tires squeal, engines roar and whine and horns honk as you wreak havoc on the streets of Hong Kong. The audio and voice acting during the cutscenes is well done but nothing too outstanding. The sound effects that come with all of the damage are all top notch. Shattering glass and loose car doors cartwheeling down the street all make believable sounds.  The music itself sounds like the ~action theme~ from any number of cheesy action oriented B-movies, which means it works well for the game. Even with all of the impressive graphical work in Wreckless, we don't see why the custom soundtrack couldn't have been included especially since it could've helped the replay value of an otherwise thin game.   Wreckless feels like an out of control joyride through the streets of Hong Kong in a high performance rental car. You not only don't care about the damage you're dishing out, you're looking forward to the next big object you can take down just so you can see what it will look like. The outstanding graphics and lighting are the kind of features we've been waiting for on the Xbox. It looks like something fresh, something that could only be done on the most powerful machine around even though it follows the old school videogame formula of low brow fun and more low brow fun. Even with its shortcomings, lack of features and depth, Wreckless is the first in a string of upcoming Xbox titles we're about to see that delivers well developed solid gameplay to go with those outstanding Microsoft powered graphics. Xbox owners have had to suffer through a lot of old PS2 remixes and ports up to this point, but Wreckless is one of those games that will make you glad you have the system.", "date": "Feb 6, 2002"}
