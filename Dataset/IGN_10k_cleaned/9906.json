While every kid with a Nintendo Entertainment System was heatedly gushing to friends over secret routes and mushrooms they uncovered in Super Mario Bros., we largely kept our heads down and mumbled wilting opposition to the onslaught. The banner retort to the dominance of Mario was Alex Kidd in Miracle World, a side-scrolling platformer that valiantly tried to establish a monkey-eared mascot for Sega.   Obviously, it didn't work. You aren't playing Alex Kidd Galaxy right now, are you?   But even if gamers have largely forgotten Alex Kidd, there remains a constituent of hardcore fans that still carry fond memories of exploring the land of Radaxian and defeating the villainous Janken the Great. Admittedly, I am one of those fans. But I am also able to shatter my rose-colored lenses from time to time and realize that the games I loved as a kid aren't necessarily classics. I cannot defend Columns. However, I am indeed quite comfortable fending off any that thumb their noses at Alex Kidd in Miracle World, which was and remains the second best game ever released for the Master System. (Number one is, of course, the original Phantasy Star.)   Alex Kidd starred in a series of games for the Master System, but none were as high profile as his first adventure, Alex Kidd in Miracle World. The game is a classic 2D platformer loaded with bright colors, precision jumping, and some very basic combat against a series of goofy enemies. Alex Kidd possessed knowledge of a martial art called shellcore, which let him punch incoming enemies like scorpions and frogs, with a massive fist. Alex toured the kingdom, swimming through seas and pushing through caves, en route to the castle where his brother Igul was kept prisoner.   Between stages, you're treated a colorful map screen. Alex Kidd sits next to the map, chowing down on a rice ball as you get a peek at where's he's headed next. After a few seconds to breathe, Alex would be dropped into the next land.   Unlike Mario in the original SMB, Alex Kidd could actually spend the cash he collected in his travels. From time to time, Alex could duck into shops and buy extra lives, power-up items, and even vehicles. Vehicles were a major differential in Alex Kidd in Miracle World, too. Alex drove a boat across a lake, jumping over enemies and obstacles. He could steer a motorcycle across flatlands, breaking through weak rocks and squishing scorpions. And in certain stages, eh could use a pedal-powered helicopter to zip through the air and pick up loads of cash bags. Each vehicle could be scuttled by hitting an obstacle, but Alex did not lose a life. He simply dropped into the water and had to swim, or complete a stage on foot. These were fun stages, especially the pedi-copter runs, because you had to figure out exactly how close Alex's vehicle could skim a surface and snatch up cash without actually touching it and losing the ride.     Along the way, Alex had to engage a series of mid-bosses in games of paper-rock-scissors -- these end-stage contents were a major departure from basic boss battles. Alex Kidd had to outsmart the mid-bosses named Paperhead, Rockhead, and Scissorshead (each indeed boasted a noggin shaped like hand making that symbol) is a one- or two-round game. There was a crystal ball item that helped you see what the opponent was about to choose, although toward the end of the game, the enemy open switched their choice at the last second. These mini-games were tough and required memorization to beat. In a way, they were a little mean, especially to younger players. You would work so hard to get a little farther into the game only to be smashed by a guessing game instead of a skill-based boss battle. However, once you did memorize the pattern and write it down, you could press through these contests with little hardship.   Alex Kidd in Miracle World was a perfection demonstration of the difference in horsepower between the NES and the Master System. Miracle World is alive with blistering colors and more detailed sprites. The game is still a charmer to look at, and much of that credit goes to designer Ossale Kohta. I have assembled a screen map of the first stage in the game so you can take a peek. Alex Kidd drops down a colorful cliff before diving into the water and racing for the rice ball that ends the level.   Click the image to see the full map.   Miracle World is also graced with some great 8-bit music. The themes are not nearly as memorable as the Mario soundtrack, but they are still very solid. The opening theme, the boss battle music, and the castle music are especially good.      Alex Kidd was an exceptional platformer with loads of action and some great puzzle-solving challenges, such as figuring out the patterns of the multi-room castle. Everything meshed together well, too. Once you figured out the game, it didn't take terribly long to finish it. I used to be able to beat the game in approximately an hour, but there is a speed run out there that shows somebody powering through Miracle World in just under 20 minutes. But it never bored me. There was just so much going on in the game, from the vehicle sequences to the boss fights, that I was constantly enthralled.   And much of that extends to today. Before writing this review, I sat back down and spent a lot of time with the game to make sure I wasn't coasting on find memories of yesteryear. The game still works. It gels. So why didn't it score a direct hit for the Master System and why is Sonic the Hedgehog the accepted Sega mascot? Simple: The follow-up games are pretty bad. And they are inconsistent, too.   Lost Stars (right) was a momentum killer.   I was a huge fan of Alex Kidd in Miracle World. I loved the story, as minimal as it was (even though it did inspire me to write my very first piece of fan fiction). I thought the platforming was challenging and I really liked how it offered so many different environments to explore -- nothing looked the same or relied on a heavy palette swap to fake a new location. So naturally I assumed that the sequel, Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars, would offer a logical continuation of this gripping adventure. Not a chance. Lost Stars is an easy-peasy platformer that doesn't look remotely as good as Miracle World. The third and fourth games in the series for the Master System, Alex Kidd in High-Tech World and Alex Kidd in Shinobi World, was better, but neither came close to the highs of Miracle World. The final nail on Alex's coffin was Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle for the Sega Genesis which was positioned as a direct sequel to Miracle World. It's a pale imitator.   Alex Kidd is making a slight comeback, though. He will appear in Sega Superstars Tennis for the Wii, Xbox 360, PS3, PS2, and DS. Here's hoping.   Spread from the manual. There are more manual grabs, including art, in the gallery.   I've placed a load of Alex Kidd in Miracle World screens in the galley, as well as scans from the game's manual. I must have poured over that manual hundreds of times when I was a kid, somehow expecting to somehow extract new, unfound arcana from its paltry pages. Take a look at the manual to see the character art, the map, and the story pages. Imagine coming into this stuff from the Atari 2600, Intellivision, and Coloecovision generation -- games were given real (if primitive) narratives and characters could be actually detailed. It was crazy to us back then and there are times when I somewhat envy that kid, getting the first look at what video games were about to become. I honestly had no idea it could get any better. Now I have games like look like BioShock and narratives like Call of Duty 4. For somebody that has watched the transition from the 2600 to now, it's astounding.   And Alex Kidd in Miracle World was, to me, a very important step in my appreciation of gaming.  Absolutely. This was a landmark game for the Sega Master System, even if it didn't define the generation like Mario eventually did. The game is gorgeous and it sets the scene for Sega's continued use of color in almost all of its games. Seek out a Master System from the internet and hunt down the cartridge. You won't regret it. And besides, once you do have that Master System, you then have the means of playing Phantasy Star, one of the greatest games of the 8-bit generation.", "date": "Jan 25, 2008"}
