His Muppet legacy shall be remembered in this and the last generations' hearts for years to come thanks to his ability to tell a good story.  Although Jim's been six feet under for quite some time now, his well-known franchise continues to live.  Recent movies like ~Muppet Treasure Island~ and ~Muppets From Space~ may not be as notorious as ~Muppets Take Manhattan~, but they still have their own crowd.  Getting right down to it, it was literally inevitable for the Muppets to appear on a next-generation console, in kart racing form, no less.  If you think Mario and Crash are the only two characters who give kart racing a good name, chalk up one more name to the list: Kermit.  Gameplay This is very straightforward, especially for those of you who are experienced in the world of go-kart games.  Hold the X button to go forward, jump with the square button, and break with the circle.  The controls fit like a glove.  The second you pick up the controller, you'll feel like you've done it before -- and chances are that you probably have, just with another game.  The level design is superb, so no matter how well you drive, you'll be given a run for your money.  At your disposal is a turbo boost bar, which drains when you hold the R1 button.  You can pick up fruit, which is found all over each level to replenish its energy, and it's best that you do.  The turbo boost can give you a big advantage and put you in the lead when you need it most.  Like all good kart racers, Muppet Race Mania is equipped with all kinds of crazy weaponry.  Chickens, bombs, fish, penguins, and other goodies may be picked up as you drive around the courses, each which can be used to give you an advantage.  It's obvious that some of the details were derived from Mario Kart of Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 fame, but that's a good thing.  As me pappy always told me, ~If it ain't broke, don't fix it.~  Now that's news we all can use.  The two weapons which stand out to me as clones of Mario Kart's are the penguins and chickens.  The penguin is just like the fake item block and the chicken is like a red shell.  The other two speak for themselves!  The bomb blows up, and the fish.. uh.. well, we all know what fish are good for, right?  Righto.  You probably wouldn't expect much competition from cute little puppets, but boy, you are wrong.  These guys can be slick and nasty, and they're quite content with screwing you over when you least expect it.  Unlike you, the Muppets know the shortcuts to each race and will use this knowledge to their advantage.  If you watch them carefully, you'll be able to pinpoint exactly where you can sneak through certain areas.  Even then, you're still going to have a difficult time coming in first.  I've found that I can stay in first place up until the last lap with ease in some races.  Then, right out of nowhere, I get pummeled with a massive barrage of chickens, bombs, and fish, which causes me to fall to about fourth place.  No matter whether you win or lose, you're still going to have a great time.  Race locations are based upon areas in the Muppet movie universe.  Yes, you fans of the Muppet Christmas Carol will be able to put your weary heart to rest at last, because there are several tracks included that are based upon the film.  In fact, there are four tracks per each Muppet movie ever made.  Here are some examples of courses you'll be able to interact with:   The Great Muppet Caper:  Happiness Hotel, Mallory Gallery  Muppets Take Manhattan:  Central Park, New York City  Christmas Carol:  Chamber,  Rooftops Muppet Treasure Island:  Dock,  Lagoon Muppets From Space:  Secret Base, Laboratory   In addition to these areas, there are four secret courses.  In all, you will find 24 whopping areas to zoom around.  But the fun doesn't stop here, folks.  When you first put the game in your PlayStation, you're able to use Kermit, Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie, Rizzo, Beaker, Rowlf, and everyone's favorite, Animal.  The more courses you finish in first, the more characters you unlock.  You can unlock a bunch, too!  17 other Muppet stars will be made available as you progress.  But that's not all.  You can also unlock several different karts for each character.  A kart game just wouldn't be complete without a two-player mode.  As you may have guessed, playing against a friend is tons of fun in Muppet Race Mania.  Not only can you race against your buddy and other non-player characters, but you can also do battle against him or her mono y mono.  Although there are two dozen courses for you both to explore, about only half are races.  The other half is divided into two kinds:  'battle' and 'stunt'.  Naturally, the word 'battle' is associated with multiplayer fun, so this is a must.  In the battle courses, you try to outlast the other players, who will do what it takes to make you lose.  The battle stages are covered with weapons all over the place, so you can use them to your advantage.  Unfortunately, your opponents can, too.  These levels are great when you're playing against a human.  It's a shame that you can only have two people going at it at one time.    The stunt mode, on the other hand, is practically made for only one player.  Despite its name, you really don't pull off stunts here at all, so the name will throw you.  These levels are designed like an obstacle course.  In order to get to the end, one must jump onto ramps, enter portals, avoid pits, and leave mostly unscathed.  Don't expect something like Tony Hawk here.  Before you enter a stage, you're treated to a short clip from one of the many Muppet flicks.  If you race at one of the tracks in ~Muppets From Space~, for example, you might see a piece of video from when the cast of characters tries to enter a Barbie-sized door.  At New York City in ~Muppets Take Manhattan~, you'll see a few seconds of tall skyscrapers that loom over the streets.  The clips are fun to watch, but it's the gameplay that makes this a great game.  Graphics I'm impressed!  The visual detail, characters, and level design are all a fine piece of work.  Despite a few errors, like racer polygons meshing with track polygons, Muppet Race Mania looks as appealing as it plays.   The race locations, which are based off of corresponding areas in the full-length films, put the gamer in the Muppet world, where silliness and creativity collide.  Everything is very colorful, downright wacky, textured flawlessly, and the Muppets are represented perfectly.  Not only this, but the frame rate is smooth and doesn't drop for a second.  Sounds Yet again, I'm impressed!  I didn't expect the music to be as high quality as it is.  The tunes are catchy, memorable, and even nostalgic in some cases.  Remember the old Muppet Show?  A version of the theme song can be found in the theatre level, so all you fans yearning to remember the past will find yourselves humming along.  The sound effects and voice acting are equally enjoyable.  Each character has specific lines that he or she says, and they're the real deal.  Cheesy mockeries are nowhere to be found in the cast of voice actors.  Recall the two old men that make fun of everything the Muppets do?  Their smart-mouthed comments are at the beginning of each stage.  But beware:  some of what they say is extremely corny.  A rolling of eyes may result. It is very refreshing to see a big license turn into such a cool game.  I insist that Jim Henson would not be twisting, turning, and writhing in torment if he knew that this game existed.  In fact, he'd probably want to crawl out of his grave and buy Muppet Race Mania, just so he could see how much fun his creations are to play with.  It's obvious that this is made for kids, but kart racing fans of all ages will fall in love if they give this a chance.", "date": "Oct 5, 2000"}
