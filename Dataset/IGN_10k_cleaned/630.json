{"name": "Scrabble [1999]", "name_review": "Scrabble", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/13/scrabble-2", "text": "Let's take a trip down memory lane.  It's a rainy Saturday and your Mom goes into the closet and pulls out a boardgame - it's not just any boardgame, it's Scrabble, the crossword game for those with a dictionary-like memory (Yes, Steve, I'm talking about you). If you were one of those prodigies born with George Will's vocabulary already hardwired to your cerebellum, then these recollections of Scrabble afternoons are probably the stuff of dreams. Then there are the rest of us poor saps who don't know what Quinoa is or that Quartzy is even a word (the highest-scoring word in Scrabble in case you were wondering). Fortunately, with this latest electronic release of Scrabble, Hasbro has managed to create a game that pleases both camps by resurrecting all the challenge of the original title while adding a load of help for those of us who are still thumbing through the Expand Your Vocabulary section of the Reader's Digest every month. Best of all, the company has somehow managed to keep the adaptation completely faithful to the original in every way.    Even if you're not completely familiar with all the rules of the original game, Hasbro's new Scrabble is able to ensure you have a great play session. The basic idea behind the game is to score as many points as possible by placing words on the board using lettered tiles.  Each letter has a point value and the board has various point boosters such as triple word score and double letter score. Play continues around the board, with each player trying to score as many points as possible on their turn. The game ends when one person uses all their tiles and there aren't any more to pick up.  The player with the highest score is the winner.  The game is chock full of help features like a hint key that will tell you, letter by letter, the best possible word you can play on any given turn.  It's kind of like having your Mom or Dad (if Mom and Dad were geniuses) standing over your shoulder and helping you.  You know...cheating.  I found that just playing a few games through using the hints helps give you an idea of what you need to look for  plus, you always win that way.  There's also a dictionary with a full word base, several guides for things such as anagrams, which will show you all the words that are possible with the tiles you have, and hook words, which shows the words you can make combining your tiles with those already on the board.   The computer player, Maven, comes with skill levels ranging from novice to Champion plus a custom setting that can be adjusted from 900 to 2100. Scrabble freaks will understand these rating numbers... the rest of you will just want to play with them 'til they find something that provides a real challenge.  I found Maven hard to beat at the Intermediate level and a real tough customer at Expert. Champion will be a true test for the Scrabble Nazi in the family.  Finding words that are suitable can be hit or miss but the dictionary will help define any word used by your opponent so that you can learn and play at the same time.  A small consolation when being beat with words like areolas, jocose and adze. (ADZE? Noun plural of adz. Oh, ok.)  If you get bored with the basic game (unlikely), there are also some great mini games that sharpen your word skills to a razor's edge.  The 2-letter and 3-letter mini games are a good starting point.  You are given seven tiles and then have to come up with as many 2 or 3 letter words as possible.  Once you've run out of ideas, give up and the game will list the hundreds of words you overlooked.  It's a humbling and educational experience.  The anagram mini game, again making as many words as possible from the letters you're given, is the most challenging of the lot but also the most rewarding as this is where you become the Scrabble expert you always dreamed of being.  If you play enough, you may be able to develop the skills that will make you a star in the Scrabble universe. But ~star~ is only worth 4 points anyway.  Maybe you could be a ~galaxy~ -- that's worth a lot more points.   Scrabble is Internet enabled and can also be played hot seat fashion. But watch out, asbestos underwear is rather itchy and can chafe...or so my friends tell me.  There is also a Tournament mode, in which the games are timed and there's no help key (read: cheating).  This last mode is Scrabble in a vacuum and needs  to be saved for more advanced players.  The game itself has many background display options like desert and my personal favorite, bayou. What could be better than sitting down to a good game of Scrabble in a bayou? The different board types -- marble, wood or chrome - are not quite as eye catching, but it is nice to be able to play on a marble board while sitting on the beach or in space.  And remember, in space no one can hear you spell.  All in all this game is very good but it's also still just Scrabble.  If your thing is to blow up baddies or go flying off to defend the earth then you'll most likely find that, even with all the new goodies that have been added, this still isn't your game.  If, on the other hand, you love crosswords and can't find anyone who is willing to play Scrabble with you, either because you always win or are just a social outcast in general, then this is just the thing that you're looking for.  Plus it's a lot easier than rushing your dog to the all-night animal hospital just because he's choking on the tile you were about to use.  -- Duncan Turner", "date": "Jan 13, 2000"}
