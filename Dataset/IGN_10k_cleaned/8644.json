He's played soccer, tennis and baseball, raced go-karts and snowboards, and even gone up against the stars of the NBA in head-to-head street hoops action. He's a renaissance man in athletics  but it all got started with Golf. Way back on the NES, back before the Karts and the Strikers, the SSXiness and the Hoops 3-on-3, it was Golf. Just Golf.   This release isn't that  rather, it's a version a few steps more evolved. The original NES Golf was a launch title for the 8-bit console in 1985, and was about as simple as you could get, especially in its visuals. The mustached main character was meant to be Mario, but didn't really bear him much resemblance beyond the dark black 'stache and the bright red clothes. Two follow-up sequels came out in subsequent years, Golf: Japan Course and Golf: U.S. Course, and each one slowly improved on the presentation of its immediate predecessor. Those two games were Japan-only releases, though. America didn't see Mario hit the links again until 1991, in this game, NES Open Tournament Golf.   As the fourth game in the Golf series to be developed for Nintendo's 8-bit machine, NES Open benefited from the lessons learned from each of the three previous outings. And, as a result, it was a much more complete and fully-featured golf game than any that had been seen before. Revisiting it here on the Virtual Console, it's easy to see how the evolution was taking place through the late '80s and early '90s, and how the way was paved for later games, like the Nintendo 64's Mario Golf.   You can choose either one- or two-player Stroke and Match Play in NES Open, with three 18-hole courses to choose from. Stroke Play is competing for the lowest score over the course of a full 18 holes, whereas Match Play is based on winning individual holes by scoring lower than your opponent, one green at a time. Since NES Open was a later release for the NES, it offers some added depth in the form of player rankings  the game will save and record your progress as you compete and win against progressively more difficult opponents.   The added options continue in the Clubhouse, an extra screen of selectable stats, records and saved replays of impressive shots. There's also a record of your hard-earned Prize Money, won through placing highly in the game's Tournament Mode.   All of the above should sound perfectly familiar to veterans of any of the Mario Golf games, from the N64, GameCube or the two most recent models of Game Boy. And, similarly, actually playing out on the course feels much the same as those games too. Mario's swings are controlled by the same, traditional power gauge  hit the A Button to start the meter's cursor moving to the left, then hit it again to set your power, then hit it one last time on its return bounce to aim for perfect accuracy. Club selection is varied, wind conditions affect your shots' flight paths, and backspin and topspin can be introduced as well.So again, all of the above should sound just like Mario Golf  which is exactly what NES Open Tournament Golf is. Its Mario Golf 8-bit, the direct NES ancestor to a game series that ultimately became much more popular on the Nintendo 64 and later.  Its easy to recommend on its merits as the best ever golf game on the 8-bit NES, but, then, looking forward deflates that enthusiasm  because the more fully evolved N64 Mario Golf is itself a near-guaranteed candidate for eventual Virtual Console release. Fans of the plucky plumbers modern tee time outings could have a lot of fun dropping 500 Wii Points here, to experience the grandfather of their favorite games current design. But those whove never yet hit the links with Mr. Mario would be likely better off to skip the history lesson and jump straight into present day, sticking with the freebie Wii Sports Golf or perhaps picking up a copy of the Wii-compatible GameCube title, Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour.", "date": "Jun 18, 2007"}
