Whether it's a huge, feature-laden game with options up the wazoo or a simple downloadable title like the one that just hit the PlayStation Network, the gamblers look like they could be swapped between games without anyone ever noticing. So it's what's on the inside then that counts, and High Stakes on the Vegas Strip: Poker Edition does have a couple pretty solid cards up its sleeve, but it needs to play them correctly in order to come out on top.   The game sells for $9.99 via the PlayStation Store, so you probably wouldn't expect it to be as full-fledged as some of the other poker titles on the market. This is true in that it's a pretty bare-bones title with regards to features. There's a character creator, but the options here are only mid-level. You can choose different hair styles and such, but you can't mold your player's face however you'd like, change your height and weight or even customize your shirt color. But it does its job.   This doesn't look good. Likewise, the Career mode is extremely bare-bones. You begin by entering an amateur league. Winning that takes to you a pro league, and winning that gets you into the championship finale. Each level has a number of weeks worth of tournaments, and you must finish in the top six to advance to the next level. For each weekly tournament, you can play in a satellite or a super satellite game if you don't have enough cash to buy your way in to the final table, or you can always play a quick ~Deal Me In~ game and earn cash that way.   While that sounds fine on paper, that's all there is to the single-player mode. There aren't different game types in any of the tournaments (though you can choose from a handful of other options in a Deal Me In game), and the calendar is simply an ordered list of events that you must play in order to progress. You can't skip directly to the end if you're way up in the charts.   While this certainly doesn't make High Stakes a standout game presentation-wise, what matters most in the single-player portion of any poker game is the AI. Fortunately, the computer players are rather smart and will make for competent, though not necessarily aggressive, opponents. They tend to make correct calls, will slow play a hand and come back and re-raise your play and so on. They don't play as aggressively as we'd like them to nor are there any more options for difficulty than Amateur and Professional, but they do play a nice game.   Don't trust a woman in glasses. Or without, for that matter. Online is how High Stakes is meant to be played, and it's a solid experience. Notice that we simply said ~solid~ as everything here works well, but you won't find a ton of options. There are leaderboards, voice support works and so on, but you can't take part in multi-table tournaments or anything of that sort. You can only play with up to six players, and the entire game only has two environments to play in. Again, the basics work just fine, but you won't find any bells and whistles here.High Stakes on the Vegas Strip: Poker Edition is a solid game, but don't expect too many options. The character creator is a little limited, there are only two environments to play at and the career mode is simply a series of tournaments with a persistent winnings total. The online play works well, but again, you'll find a very limited set of features. Fortunately though, all of it does work well and we don't have any complaints about any of these elements except that we wish there was more to everything. If you're looking for a basic poker game where you can hop online and play against other players, you can't go wrong. But if you're looking for something that'll give you a bigger experience than a weekly house game, look elsewhere.", "date": "Sep 18, 2007"}
