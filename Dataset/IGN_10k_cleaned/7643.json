The once riveting Jurassic Park engine isn't the pinnacle of technology these days, but the developers at Dreamworks tweaked and remolded it to handle 3D scenes and lots of beautiful jungle scenes perfectly for T'ai Fu. Gameplay One of the first aspects of the game you'll notice is that T'ai Fu learns from a number of ~masters~ who teach him new fighting styles. In the beginning is the kind paternal Panda tribe that reared him, followed by the wizened Mantis master who teaches him about Chi and fighting combos. Then there's the Leopard master and his daughter, and so on and so on. Each of these knowledgeable old masters teaches the young whippersnapper T'ai Fu a lesson in fighting styles that he'll need to beat the later, more challenging levels. This gradual learning curve forms the backbone of the game's depth, which is based on as many 100 character movements and a handful of fighting ~styles.~   The moves themselves make the game a button masher of sorts, but the good kind of button masher. T'ai Fu, once a member of the powerful Tiger clan, is the last of his kind and it's his destiny in life to eventually challenge the all-powerful Dragon leader who demolished the order of life in Ancient China. T'ai Fu fights through as many as 20 levels, many with unique bosses, in which he's pitted against stronger foes who'll push him to the limits of his power and fighting ability. Each time T'ai Fu beats another boss, he learns another ~style~ of fighting, or rather another set of increasingly powerful moves. Also along his journeys, he gains control over elements such as fire, earth, and lightening as he masters the Chi power, a spiritual power of the mind.   What's surprising about T'ai Fu is that while it comes off as a little kids game, it's actually aimed at a wide range of ages, and this ~old-time~ gamer (let's just say I'm over 30) had a blast playing it. In other words, it succeeds in being more than just a kids game. T'ai Fu can pick up enemies and throw them in smoldering fire (a pleasant kind of torture), perform multiple combos, work Chi into the combos, access animalian strengths and attacks, and even perform the killer Crane Hover, in which T'ai swoops down on his prey. He's got the moves, baby. Graphics What we loosely termed the ~Jurassic Park~ engine is essentially a game engine that renders realtime environments with exquisite details and rich vibrant colors, and was first used in the game Jurassic Park for PlayStation and Sega Saturn. T'ai Fu, however, isn't a 2D game. It enables players to move all over the landscape in battle or while searching out scrolls and Jade powerups, and features a roving isometric camera.   What is done well here graphically is two fold. First, the camera angles tightly follow T'ai Fu as he marches onward through jungles, temples and swamps. If he rounds a corner, you'll see the whole environment turn with him and never will you lose him behind some ill-placed pillar or vase. This is crucial for fights since T'ai Fu often takes on as many as three enemies on-screen at once.   What may be even better conceived is the character design, which maintains a consistent attention to detail in clothing, animal form, and not-overly-cute anthropomorphism. The Mantis and Leopards are my favorites, and I looked forward to each new clan as I discovered them in the often interactive environments. Mostly, the designs were cleverly delivered. They weren't so exotic that the detail was lost in the execution, nor were their exotic forms overly designed so that the PlayStation's lack of perspective correction retarded them into mangled radiation exeriments.  There are limits to this game. There is a limit to the amount on-screen characters in a fight, there are occasional collision detection problems, and some rather plain-Jane environments that while initially looking exotic, were relatively repetitive and dull. Noteworthy special effects that work particularly well are the realtime lighted hallways and secret areas, such as those behind gongs, for instance, well done background depth, and water and fire effects.  Sound Paying attention to the sound department, Dreamworks' ancient ~Chinese-lite~ looping tracks were perfect in completing the overall sense of an old rural feudal system. The use of cymbals and other Chinese-style instruments is classic, making for good background music in general, and great searching and fighting music in particular. The music also leans a little toward an orchestral style, too, and its complexity is subtle and likeable without grating on the nerves the way most looping music does.   T'ai Fu also makes decent use of sound effects, though it's occasionally difficult to determine which animal is making what sound. Nonetheless, the animal growls and cat hisses are a refreshing change from the stock umphs, ughs, and pphisshes that pepper most fighting or similar action-style games.   In the cut-scenes, which make use of the ingame graphics, T'ai Fu discusses his destiny with the latest masters and learns the newest moves. These are decent little pieces reminiscent of those found in Spyro and Ninendo 64's Diddy Kong Racing. The characters rarely -- if ever -- move their mouths, except the dragon leader, whose mouth moves just a little slower than Fox McCloud's in StarFox. Remember bwum, mewebbde-bug, muhdat-umm, wubdatem wubdatem? Well, it's just a touch better in T'ai Fu.T'ai Fu is a game well done in almost every aspect. It does appeal to the younger gamer. And the game itself, a 3D action title with good fighting depth and a decent little storyline, is well-conceived despite its old-style game concept.I wasn't so surprised by the engine's capabilities as I was with the decent AI of the bosses and the depth of the fighting moves. Dreamworks' made sure that you if learn the new moves, you'll be rewarded, and it's rare in the game when you can simply smash buttons to get by.The game by no means is a fighter that competes with Tekken, Tobal, or Street Fighter, but it does have its moments, and the combos are quite a bit of fun. I don't know if this game will set up a new franchise or sell any T'ai Fu action figures, but I can say that for folks who love combined fighting and action  style games, and don't want to think too deeply, this game will satisfy your twitchy appetite.", "date": "Apr 6, 1999"}
