But that hasn't stopped Glu mobile for finally weighing in with their own entry, and although the game suffers from feeling like something of a ~me-too~ effort, there's no denying that Brain Genius is still a strong entry in the category. Filled with good puzzles and great presentation, Brain genius is worth downloading for anybody that hasn't yet grown tired of testing their mental prowess via a series of daily brain exercises.   Under the watchful eye of Dr. Lababidi -- perhaps pronouncing this five times fast is one of the tests? -- players will engage in a series of daily puzzles designed to test four different mental skills: Memory, calculation, logic, and visual. You can try out the exercises on an individual basis and gear up for the daily test, but you can only unlock new mental contests by playing the daily challenge. Each day you check into Brain Genius, you play these events and chart your brain growth on a handy graph. This is pretty standard fare for the genre, but Brain genius is wise not to monkey with a successful formula.   These brain training games live and die on the strength of the included exercises -- and this is where Brain Genius scores. Most of the events are winners and Glu mobile was smart to front load the game with some of the more interesting contests, like Constellation and Still Awake. In Constellation, you count the number of stars that make up a shape in the sky, but as you progress, the shapes start changing size and moving. The constellation angle works, too, thanks to a clean design. In Still Awake, you still pattern in skyscraper windows against the night sky. After the pattern flashes, you must recreate it by illuminating windows in the grid. Again, good idea made better by clean design.   I also really liked Bouncing Balls, where you must tap the number of the ball that arcs the highest amongst a group of spheres. At first, the balls simply bounce up and down, but soon, the screen is crowded with colorful balls moving in different arcs. I also enjoyed Alien Invasion, Spider's Web, and Time Difference. The only one I found to be a drag was the basic arithmetic mini-game -- which has been done to death but seems to be an absolute requirement for the genre. Enough already.   On some handsets, Brain Genius lets you use your camera to snap a pic of a friend or pet to use in a sliding puzzle challenge. That's a nice bit of personalization that helps the game stand out a little from the crowd.   The game includes different skill levels for each puzzle: Junior, Master, and Guru. Master is a pleasant difficulty, but Guru can get punishing. Brain Genius also includes both regular Sudoku and Kakuro, which are good extras that add value.   As mentioned, Brain Genius has great presentation. Many of the puzzles have clever, clean designs that elevate the concept, such as Constellation and Still Awake. The people-counting game Alien Invasion is another good example of a way to make a familiar idea more compelling -- the little people and aliens are silly, but not distracting. When you complete the daily exercises, the good doctor scores your brain on the four categories and then compares you to historical smarties. This is another nice design choice, as everybody wants to be like Galileo, right?  Brain Genius is a strong addition to the brain training scene, but its lateness does affect its effectiveness. Chances are you have played many of these exercises already but just with different paint jobs. Some as still good fun and engaging as all get-out, but the degree of familiarity lessens the impact. Had Brain Genius lead the pack inside of headed up the rear, its ideas would be fresher and worthy of a higher score. If you're new to the brain training scene, you essentially have three choices: Brain Challenge (Gameloft), Brain juice (Digital Chocolate), and Brain genius (Glu Mobile). You cannot go wrong with any of the three.", "date": "May 22, 2007"}
