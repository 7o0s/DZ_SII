Each WW2 sim that's preceded Screamin' Demons has its strengths and weaknesses, and SDOE is no exception; we've still yet to see the definitive WW2 simulation. However, despite some glaring faults, SDOE offers some truly unique features that make it a worthwhile sim for any discerning fan of combat aviation.  The approach taken in designing SDOE was to treat each individual object as a separate entity, with all of them coming together to form a complete system. The effect is best witnessed in the damage modeling and in the results that unfold when a wing or some other assorted part is shot off, each piece subject to the laws of gravity and aerodynamics. The complex level of physics carries over into the area of flight modeling as well, delivering a very believable sensation of flight, especially down low. More importantly, each plane flies and feels distinctly unique. This serves to bring every plane's capabilities into play, hence reinforcing the tactics of the day: boom and zoom in a Focke Wulf, out-turn your opponent in a Spit, take advantage of the high-altitude performance of the P-51. Constant (and very necessary) adjustments to the ~trim~ will remind you of Warbirds.   Unfortunately, all of this wonderful effort is invalidated when it comes to bleeding energy and the lack of a viable stall/spin model. Planes seemingly turn forever without consequence. Without the constant threat of departure from flight, the single biggest thrill of a dogfight simply isn't there. Keeping your plane from falling out the sky while trying to get on someone's six is where the rush of combat comes from, otherwise it's all just ~Quake in the air~ point and shoot. Still, there are enough distinctions among the plane sets that a judicious use of appropriate tactics will reward the smarter pilot. After experiencing the product in beta form, some have claimed that Activision intentionally dumbed-down the flight model to make their product more appealing to the casual gamer or novice simmer. According to Parsoft programmer Michael Harrison, however, a late change was made to the ~extreme behavior~ of the planes. As a result, they apparently went too far in their tweaks. At least they are aware of this, so we can only hope for an eventual fix of some kind. On a side note, SDOE could also benefit from some in-game joystick damper and deadzone settings, because the response is occasionally a bit twitchy.   The player can fly ten different planes. Some of these are popular, and some are rarely seen in a simulation. The standard P-38, Spitfire, FW-190 and P-51 Mustang are all present here, but it's a rare treat to fly the Typhoon, Mossie, or even a B-17 or Lancaster. While in a bomber, different crew stations can be taken over, but the bombardier position isn't as exciting as it could be. Targeting is a simple reticule; the game lacks sophisticated Norden bombsight features or bombardier-control of the aircraft. This is a real shame since SDOE is the only recent WW2 sim that gives us flyable bombers, yet the best part is crippled.   Graphics are a sort of mixed bag. Under Direct3D at the highest of resolutions with a TNT board, SDOE is simply breathtaking. The cloud implementation in both individual and overcast layers are by far the best ever; screenshots just don't do them justice. Furthermore, this is a very fast graphics engine and scales incredibly well. Various amounts of clipping do occur, though, depending on the resolution and renderer used. 3Dfx's Glide API will only run in 640x480, even if you have SLI Voodoo2's and try to set the resolution higher. And until Parsoft offers a fix, Voodoo Rush owners can only use the software render option. Hits to enemy aircraft yield generic and boring flash effects, and the fire and smoke displays look equally out of place (especially so when compared to those voluminous clouds). The tracer rounds themselves are uninspired, but the way their smoke trails shoot off towards the target are the most realistic I've ever seen. Unlike European Air War, however, Screamin' Demons gives a very claustrophobic effect. The terrain is very small, and it's made smaller by a fog that feels much too close.  The cockpits are strictly 3D, no 2D panels here. They almost look as good as those found Jane's World War 2 Fighters, and, like WW2F, you can adjust your perspective. In fact, you'll probably want to scoot your perspective back just a little for most of your flight. However, this ability to change perspective doesn't seem quite stable, and I suspect it's responsible for the cockpit shake I often see. It's incredibly annoying, and I don't think it's related to a strained engine or any other damage. I've seen it happen at a dead stop on the ground with the engine off - it's as if it can't make up its mind as to which position to hold, so it shifts back and forth.  The padlocking features aren't the most complete ever, but they are the most unique. After going through some cumbersome commands to lock up the target you wish to track, the padlock will automatically zoom in towards the bogey as you get closer to your optimum gun range. It's sort of a compromise between the limitations of a 2D screen and statements made from veteran pilots who said they waited until the enemy aircraft completely filled up their entire field of vision before squeezing the trigger. It's a bit awkward at first, but ingeniously effective - I'm surprised this hasn't been thought of sooner.  The AI is very competent and very complex. One look at the mission editor shows that Skill, Loyalty, Aggressiveness, Morale, and even Sanity, all play a part in the makeup of the AI pilot. A skilled computer-controlled plane in SDOE won't just circle around until you are on their six; they judiciously use the vertical and will sometimes split-s away when in trouble. Unfortunately, even though there are ground objects in the game, such as tanks, they just sit there. That's a pity, because action on the ground, similar to what's found in other sims of this genre, is sorely missed here.  Perhaps the most debatable aspect of this sim is the gameplay itself. There are no campaigns in SDOE, just individual missions. Personally, I find a game is most enjoyable when there is some sort of role-playing aspect involved. Yes, you can create a pilot whose success is tracked from mission to mission, with medals awarded for exceptional deeds, but that's not quite the same thing as in European Air War. Even though SDOE mostly excels in recreating the thrill of combat (even more so if they fix the flight model), for many of us this simply isn't enough. We've seen better in certain flight-sim sub-genre's, so in some respects, this is a step backwards. However, SDOE is ideal for fans of Fighter Duel, a sim that achieved cult-like status among the multi-player crowd. In fact, SDOE is a sort of a spiritual successor to Fighter Duel: It's probably the closest thing to Fighter Duel 2 we will see, since that project has been placed on indefinite hold. Multi-play is extremely well thought out, offers co-op play with the AI, and is extremely stable. Throw in some Activision servers scattered world-wide and concerns about relatively weak offline play disappear for many a virtual pilot.    Screamin' Demons isn't everyone's cup of tea, and it's a patch or two away from fixing what it claims to offer now. But until the day arrives when we can play the ultimate and complete WW2 simulation, SDOE is worth the harddrive space, despite its limitations.  -- Gordon Berg", "date": "Apr 7, 1999"}
