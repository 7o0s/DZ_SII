Most game titles of this type claim that you can pursue any number of paths to win. Hey, be a trader! Be a freelance mercenary! Be a space cadet! They don't tell you that being a mercenary or space cadet plays as pretty much the same thing in their universe, or that you can only trade up to a certain point before the storyline forcibly kicks in, or prevents you from finding any better ships and equipment for sale until you do more plot missions. Some of these games are really well made, and a few are classics; but the ability to pursue a profession of your choice in them is deceptive.    X3 takes place in a huge universe: 130 named sectors, each with its own events, micro-economy, and people in charge. Some sectors, like Boron space, are well-patrolled and good places to start out as a novice, but they lack the kind of bargains and action that a more advanced trader or combat jockey will enjoy. Others, like the Paranid sectors, provide more opportunities for traders in search of a great deal, but also numerous pirates looking to feast on those same traders. There are a variety of plants and factories scattered about producing and demanding any of more than 100 items, as primary or intermediate resources, and finished products. There are also other traders, various policing forces, taxis, independent travelers, pirates (as already noted), and the Khaak and Xenon, two mysterious races who prefer reducing the rest of existence to interstellar rubble.     X3 is broad. Yes, it has a plot, but you can choose to ignore it for literally as long as you want without suffering any penalties while you explore the universe, seek out its more than half a dozen races, and involve yourself in trade and/or combat. (There's even an option that allows you to play a completely plotless game, setting your own personal goals.) Seek out space combat right away, if you prefer, or just buy and sell; or use your renowned financial acumen to make a fortune; purchase a fleet of ships, upgrade their equipment and software, and become a flying space terror.   There are three courses open to you as a free range galactic capitalist in X3. You can buy mining and transportation equipment and set yourself up besides a nice, plump asteroid field. Alternatively, you can go through several sectors looking for overruns and shortages -- buying wherever the first occurs, selling to the latter. Since the X universe's economic model is flexible, it adjusts to changes. Sell a lot of Stott Spices, and the businesses needing them in that sector will pay less for them until the supply runs out. But with various plants and factories operating in different sectors, some of them specialize in a few goods that create periodic shortages and surpluses, so you're always guaranteed a steady stream of suppliers and customers. Finally, you can purchase, transport, and establish your own factories and factory complexes, using and creating resources that feed into one another, to develop sophisticated end products for sale.    You can even automate some of this activity if you purchase the right kind of software for your ships, leaving you free to explore. These ~programs~ cover the field, from optimizing use of your rudder for greater ship maneuverability, to relay satellites that pass along distant sector prices, to determining all of the prices in whatever sector you enter without landing anywhere (which saves a great deal of time). X2 had modders who created plenty of additional in-game ~software~ for purchase at sector stores, and we'll likely see the same phenomenon with X3.   You'll be happy to know that not only does trading make you rich, but it also makes you friends. The more you trade with a given race, the more that race likes you over time. Your reputation with them improves, going through many ranks -- the Argon, for example, have 16 ranks, from Enemy of the Federation to Hero of the Federation (and passing through such interesting waystations as Suspected Foe, Confirmed Friend, and Federation Overwatch). Buy and sell on a massive scale from a race, and they'll like you better; as they will, too, if you perform various tasks for them. If your rank is high enough, you should be able to buy some of the better gear they reserve only for their exclusive buddies. Use it or just continue buying it and selling it to others. It's up to you.    I've focused on trade because the model in X3 is so sophisticated, and the opportunities so much greater than in any previous, similar type of game. But if you prefer leaping into the action like some interstellar Genghis Khan, laughing as you eviscerate your foes and loot their ships, this game can suit your bloody needs, too. The same course of action already recommended for gaining access to specialized equipment -- becoming friends with a race -- works for combat. Are the Argon ships in a certain sector being harassed by pirates? Go pirate hunting. Check out the missions at local sector stores, and perform a few. The violent ones are less safe than the secure trade runs, but you'll see your reputation rise quickly. Oh, the joys of being a cosmic sociopath!   X3 physics allow you to bottom out speed and swing around while inertia carries you forward. You can strafe targets, maneuver in 3D, fire any configuration of your various weapon types at any time, fore or aft, and command a fleet of semi-automated fighters to follow basic directions (such as focus on one enemy, or protect your kamikaze butt). Game visuals are overwhelming, with individual models and designs for every race and ship type, and the New Age-like soundtrack only adds to the ~like wow~ effect. But that depends on how long you can see them; and in X3, that can be a very short period of time, thanks to planet-destroying bugs, which we'll get to in a minute.     If You've Played X2 Before   There are no new major features in X3, but many, many incremental improvements. Once you ignore the cosmetics, it looks and feels the same -- until you play for a bit, and discover the wealth of tweaks that have been implemented under the hood.   Remember when you were apparently the only trader with a ship in the universe? Seemed odd, didn't it? Now, you have competition. Since factory owners no longer have their own fleets, the cosmic market has developed independent traders to take up the slack. They go around buying up energy, food, hi-tech goods or armaments, wherever it's abundant and cheap, and selling it wherever it's scarce and dear. There are still deals to be had, mainly by purchasing and selling goods that don't meet the specialized interests of the nearest traders (we'll get more into that, in a moment), but you have to stay alert to changing conditions. You can also trade with the trader ships themselves, but they tend to offer only average prices. A good running dog of capitalism will never settle for that.   Player- and AI-controlled factories were in X2, and you could build factory loops that took the output of one factory and made it the input of another. This meant buying, transporting and placing a series of factories ideally next to each other, and that was about as much fun as a televangelists conference. Factory complexes are a welcome improvement in X3, where you can buy them like one-stop prefabs, selecting specific factories in advance, moving them together to a site, then assembling the lot into a single, huge, floating unit.   So there are factory complexes and traders in the universe, now, and it no longer feels as dead as it previously did. There are also quite a few non-trading vehicles hanging around, such as taxis and privately licensed ships. They stop off at factories, equipment stores, and trading posts, where you can hail them and ask questions or make demands. Most of the conversational options are, as expected, routine: where's the nearest gate, surrender or I'll destroy you, etc. But you can also attack or scan these vehicles, sizing them up. With some ships, such as freighters, a scan is illegal, and the owner will contact the local law enforcement to get after you, at once. You can always go to some of the more lawless sectors to play pirate, but then you'll have to deal with other wolves who are just as hungry as you -- not to mention at least a one or two galactic species that are enthusiastic about proving their manic xenophobia.   Piracy is in any case a financially hazardous enterprise, unless you're running an extremely fast vehicle with powerful weaponry and a lot of luck. The easiest way to monetary success in X2 was properly arranging a factory loop; but in X3 you can make a killing through sector hopping sales, and even specializing in certain kinds of goods. You can concentrate on the purchase and sale of hi-tech items, food, banned substances, or even energy; for energy is always lacking in many sectors of the X3 universe. Then, when you build up enough of a reputation with a given race from having handed them a lot of regular trade, they'll supply you with access to their better grade of weaponry -- and you can sell all of it, pretty much anywhere you go. It absorbs a ton of cash, but brings huge returns.     Reputation? Yes. Where X2 allowed you to buy anything from anyone who would rather sell to you than kill you, your level of reputation with a race now governs what items you can buy. Fancy those nice warheads, or that license allowing you to act as an auxiliary arm of Argon law enforcement? Well, you'll going to have to earn them through trade and other services. So there.   The universe will feel different, too, as you fly about and get adjusted. Where it was once a case of ~one-sized sector fits all,~ now there's a lot of variety, with quite a few sectors considerably larger than they were in the past. You'll find gates are often sneakily off-plane, or hidden behind stellar objects. Space physics are slightly different than before, allowing you to hit [BACKSPACE] to kill all speed, do a swift turn while inertia keeps you moving, then blast off in a different direction. I haven't seen this tactic employed by too many enemies, but it works great when you're packing superior arms against multiple opponents.   You may feel less happy about the menu system, however, with entirely new key assignments and some deeply nested commands that are a chore to find. You can go back to the old way of doing things -- it's still available as a configurable option -- but then you'll miss some of the newer commands required in the game. The old cockpit has been removed, too. Now you have a featureless, unobstructed transparent plate: that's right, your monitor screen without anything from your cockpit on it. Aside from a few important, floating readouts, that's what you get.   Finally, to end on an upbeat note, all ships in a class now improve in quality as they rise in number, so that an M3 is faster and has more weapon mounts than an M2. Seem small? Not if you went through the headache memorizing the out-of-sequence differences in X2.     Made to Run Out of the Box, Right?   Wrong. I'm sympathetic to developers who are continually producing bigger and better products these days. Because of this, their inability to completely test for every problem that players discover without fail is understandable. But when a game hits the market with pervasive bugs and in an incomplete state, my quality of mercy becomes very, very strained. X3 falls into this category. Since we make a practice at IGN of reviewing unpatched software, I had the great joy of watching my game crash every 30-60 minutes. The visuals, beautiful as they were, sometimes crawled along as a geological pace. This was particularly the case for some reason around factory complexes. And after leaving the game, I found some features in applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel no longer worked. Rebooting solved the problem, so a memory leak was the likely culprit.   The plot missions weren't complete, either. (They also weren't well written, people with great responsibility and position sometimes acting like emotionally disturbed pre-teens. But that's about standard for most games, isn't it?) Without giving anything away, I'll only state that some personal encounters didn't occur when they were supposed to, and successfully completed race missions didn't always result in points towards reputation improvement.   One of the changes I was really looking forward to in X3 was its auto-docking AI. Early X-universe titles, like the old Elite series, forced you to do your own docking and liftoffs manually, at least until you raised enough capital to invest in docking software. In X2 this thankfully wasn't a test of dexterity, but a repetitive and lengthy chore that got old, quickly. X3 by contrast supports auto-docking as soon as you start the game, but the AI is problematic. I can't tell you the number of times I've used it to visit sites in the X3 world, only to find it couldn't compute a simple angle between two slowly moving objects -- my ship, and the station -- for entry. On one memorable occasion the AI tried seven times, approaching and withdrawing, before I received an AI-created screen message telling me that it was impossible to find a suitable trajectory.   Then, within three seconds of the message, the AI maneuvered into a proper path, and we entered the station.   Factory complexes are again especially prone to this. Even with the 1.21.01 patch, the individual factories aren't perfectly designed to fit together. As a result, attempts to send resources from one factory to another in the same complex sometimes result in physical antics that would have done the silent film Keystone Kops up proud. And like the Kops, there's a lot of physical activity that ultimately solves nothing.  Earlier, I mentioned the game being unfinished; and so it is. It's reasonable to expect some minor changes in a game manual before the product appears, but X3's manual is so far off course as to require an entire manual of correctionwhich is not provided. But worst of all, in my opinion, is the absence of an in-game tutorial. X3 is the most complex simulation of its kind, yet. It has more commands at its disposal than a Las Vegas lounge lizard has pick-up lines. So dropping you into this universe with nothing more than a few incomplete pages of listed and occasionally incorrect key and mouse controls just doesnt cut it. X2 had a tutorial that walked you through movement, combat, and ship controls in a passive environment. That much, at least, Enlight owes its buyers of X3, assuming it wants to keep them happy.The 1.21.01 patch I mentioned finds the game more stable and the quest holes fixed, but still leaves many other problems intact. Another patch is supposedly on its way (with a few new features, too), but bear in mind that if you buy X3: Reunion as-is, you're buying a title with an extremely high learning curve and a docking AI that's great low comedy. There's still plenty of enjoyment to be had in a game whose depth only becomes apparent as you really dig into it, but this wine really shouldn't have been released before its time.", "date": "Dec 7, 2005"}
