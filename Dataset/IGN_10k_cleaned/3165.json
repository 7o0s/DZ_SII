However, more than a year of total silence went by before Ubi Soft slipped Pro Rally 2002 out in the U.S. As the first rally title on GameCube it's certainly in a class of its own, and with a focus on being more accessible and arcadey it's pretty easy to jump into for beginners; however, for rally experts it may proof too basic to be worth any interest.   The FactsFirst rally title for GameCube  Improved over the PlayStation 2 version of Pro Rally 2002  Six gameplay modes: School, Time Trial, Championship, Arcade, Trophy, and Versus  Multiple tracks in several countries including Italy, England, Greece, Argentina and other countries  20 official rally cars including brands from Mitsubishi, Peugot 206, Toyota, Audi, and Seat Cordoba  Graphics engine expanded to include better textures, volumetric shadows, and environment mapping  Dolby Pro Logic II support  No progressive scanGameplay  Pro Rally 2002 has been tucked away in a corner at Ubi Soft for a very long time. Oddly, the company has barely acknowledged its existence, save for sending us a final copy of the game. When it arrived we found a very decent rally experience waiting for us. Pro Rally 2002 is most certainly focused on providing an accessible racing experience. It doesn't attempt to perfectly simulate the physics of real world racing, and instead just tries to be fun. However, rally is a sport of accuracy and precision, so when the rules start to bend so does its representation of the racing style. In the case of Pro Rally 2002, this is exactly how it has been crafted -- to resemble rally, but to have an overall forgiving feel to the gameplay.   In terms of features, the mode selection is pretty varied and includes School, Time Trial, Championship, Arcade, Trophy, and Versus. School and Championship basically go hand-in-hand. First you must earn a license in about a dozen custom events, which range from practicing hairpin turns to managing the vehicle on ice. Once past this event, you can participate in Championship. Like the real sport, you are a loner on the tracks, shooting to maintain the best times possible. At the end of each race you are rated according to your time and ranked. Over the course of the circuits you cumulatively earn points and are ranked at the end of the championship. It's a pretty respectable setup that works, and keeps you on your toes by informing you at each checkpoint how your competitors are doing.     There seems to be some disagreement between the idea of being a ~pro rally~ driver and making that style accessible to everyone. For example, you have to earn a license in the School sessions before you can even begin a career in Championship mode. For experienced rally players, this will pose no problems, but for those new to the sport, it can be pretty frustrating. Instead, we would have liked to see earning a license -- which is basically a tutorial -- handled differently. If in fact Pro Rally 2002 intends to be highly accessible, earning your marks for your license as you progressively approached harder tracks would have made for a smoother progression.    Additionally, the Arcade mode, where you can race against multiple cars, and Trophy mode, which has special circuit challenges, must both be unlocked. At least in the case of Arcade, it would have been nice if that alternative style of rally racing was unlocked from the beginning. Again, it seems Pro Rally 2002 is a bit confused on what it wants to be. With no Arcade mode available from the get-go, but a rather demanding School mode, the style seems to clash.    Fortunately, there is Time Trial mode and this does let you have your way with a number of the tracks without asking you to unlock them through the Championship. This is very easy to jump into and probably a better way to practice than enduring the School sessions. There's also a two-player split-screen Versus mode that lets you partake in any of the tracks you find in Time Trial.    As a whole, Pro Rally 2002 is a mixed bag that will seem a little demanding to start-up rally wannabes and, conversely, loose and arcadey to enthusiasts of the sport. It has a fair amount of detail, including car damage that must be repaired through assistance parks after rallies, as well as the ability to customize your vehicle prior to each race, choosing tire type, gear box, differential, brakes and suspension. You can feel this in the races, but the physics model is pretty forgiving; you can often stop and go with extremely fast acceleration. There are also a few oddities such as the ability to send your car ramping high into the air that makes it clearly an arcade rally title.    Namely those interested in these arcadey aspects will want to give it a look.    Graphics  Being a port from the PlayStation 2, the graphics engine for Pro Rally 2002 is rough around the edges. Textures, while improved from the PS2 are still not very detailed and texture seaming is very present in the only moderately detailed polygonal world. However, Ubi Soft has made some efforts to take advantage of the GameCube hardware for a few impressive tricks. The trees cast volumetric shadows atop the cars, which also happen to reflect the real environment around them. Both are subtle effects, but if you look out for them they add some detail to the worlds.    No progressive scan support.   Sounds  Your predictable mix of European style techno music. Nothing too impressive going on there, but it's palatable. For sound effects, Ubi Soft went a step ahead of the rest and included Dolby Pro Logic II support. It's nothing too over the top, and with rally being basically a one-car sport, there's not a lot to hear outside of your engine, but it fills the soundscape nicely. Meanwhile, the quality of the samples is pretty respectable too. It's clear that the team at Ubi Soft had some decent ideas, but there's a very blurry line between the arcade and simulation aspects of Pro Rally 2002. For example, there's no speedometor and for manual shifting you have to switch to ~driver's seat~ view. So, while I had fun with it for a while, I just couldn't attach myself to it. After seeing what's being done with other rally titles out there like Rallisport Challenge, Colin McRae, and even Rally Fusion, it doesn't seem Pro Rally 2002 has much to stand on outside of being the first in the genre for GameCube.Check it out for a rental, but for a long-term investment there should be more rally goodness soon enough.", "date": "Nov 8, 2002"}
