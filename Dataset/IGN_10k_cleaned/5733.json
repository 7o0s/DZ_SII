I was a Tempest junkie, a BattleZone freak, and a BurgerTime fiend.  Of course, Centipede got its fair share of my hard earned chore quarters.  So, after playing the beta months ago, I was looking forward to seeing this title finally released.  When it came into our offices last week, I literally had to fend off Trent and Jason to get a chance at it first.  Let me tell you, I wasn't disappointed at all.  This title lived up to my expectations and proved that old arcade classics can still be fun, especially with new features.  In the arcade mode, the designers at Laughing Lizard have totally recaptured the feel of the classic.  It works pretty much like you remember it with a slightly tilted screen to give you a better 3D perspective.  The mother centipede starts at the top of the screen.  You're in your shooter at the bottom.  Separating the two of you is a field of mushrooms.  As the centipede scrolls down the screen, you have to shoot her before she gets you.  Sounds easy enough.  Of course, there are spiders, scorpions, and fleas waiting to pounce on you when you're in the heat of battle and the mother centipede splits into multiple parts as you literally blast her to bits.  Not only are there updated 3D graphics, there's a new adventure mode as well.  In the adventure mode you assume the role of Wally, a no-so-heroic hero who is chosen to take control of the shooter and rid the world of the Queen Centipede.  Gameplay in the adventure mode is similar to the arcade mode, but you have free range of movement over different landscapes such as cities, snowy plains, and the dreaded hive itself.  Although your primary objective is to destroy the centipedes in each level, you also have other objectives such as saving the 'wee people' and keeping the village buildings intact.  To help you in your fight, the shooter can even be upgraded with a variety of power-ups like the ladybug shield, triple shot, and super missile.  There are also a number of new and different mushrooms that affect gameplay in various ways.  For example, ice mushrooms burst into harmful shards when shot, fire mushrooms shoot fireballs when destroyed, and reflective mushrooms bounce your shoots in random directions when struck.  In addition to the classic overhead view, you can control Wally in either an over-the-shoulder or first person view.  It's the adventure mode which really breathes new life into this title and the folks at Laughing Lizard have done a great job in capturing the feel of the classic while adding a few modernized goodies.   Centipede PC also allows you to play multiplayer with a friend, doubling your chances of getting to the Queen 'Pede.  You can either play split screen on the same system or go against the creepy-crawlies over a network or via the Internet.  In an industry overcrowded with ultra-violent blood baths, Centipede offers up a tasty dish of unadulterated amusement that promises to be fun for gamers of all ages.  With the disappointment of Frogger last year, we weren't sure if Centipede would live up to our high standards.  All we can say is that we were hopelessly wrong ... Centipede delivers everything we hoped it would and more.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Nov 17, 1998"}
