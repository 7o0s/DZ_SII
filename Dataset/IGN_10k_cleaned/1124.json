The genre at its best combines brilliant art direction with intense gameplay, with the likes of Radiant Silvergun, Axelay, Lords of Thunder and Gates of Thunder turning out to be some of the finest experiences of the last and past generations.  It's a dieing breed, the 2D shooter, but let's not let it end.  I want one million people to go out and buy Capcom's Giga Wing.  That's right... 1 million.  Come on... if everyone here tells five friends to tell five friends to buy the game, reaching the million mark shouldn't be a problem.  Then, the evil bastards at the helm of the various gaming giants will take note and say ~Let us more shooting action get!~  To be honest, you won't be receiving the finest shoot-'em-up ever with Giga Wing.  In fact, compared to the above games (one of which never made it to America, and two of which were on a cult system alone), this is a pretty low class deal.  Still, by picking up this game, you'll be exposing yourself to what could be one of the last shmups ever, and starving shooter fans may not be able to resist. Giga Wing is of the overhead, vertical scrolling arcade variety of shooters, and makes good use of the Dreamcast hardware to display a plethora of bullets and enemies on screen simultaneously, with only a few instances of slowdown.  You've never seen this much on-screen movement, although Radiant Silvergun comes amazingly close (god bless Treasure), and the resulting intensity should prove to be in some ways a revelation.  Screens are full of moving objects, from bullets and laser fire going every which way and enemies appearing from all corners (although mostly from the top).  Each of the four selectable ships are well capable of dealing with most of the on screen mayhem.  You can fire a standard blast, which can be powered up by collecting ~P~ icons strewn about the level.  You also have available a limited number of screen filling bombs, which leave you invincible while doing major damage to enemies all about the screen.  Also included is a unique reflection shield feature.  Holding down the fire button to charge up a shield will momentarily reflect incoming fire back at the enemy.  In practice, this last feature doesn't work as well as it sounds, as the slight lag between when you hold down the fire button and when the shield emerges doesn't fit well with the reactionary nature of the game.  More often than not, I tried to press the shield button, but the shield didn't emerge until after it was too late.  I started to depend more on bomb attacks rather than the shield.  There are a couple of cool twists that will make you keep on playing.  Each ship is piloted by a character who has his own story and progresses through the levels in a different order.  Strangely, in bringing the game over, Capcom has removed all voices that were found in the Japanese version.  Hmm... maybe with voices, the story would have actually made sense.  Oh well....  Each character has his own abilities and powers - I managed to convince myself to play through the game four times just because of that.  And if you're interested in the whole high score thing, look no further than this game.  You'll gain high points by killing enemies, for sure, but bosses give you maximal pointage only if you blast certain sections before taking out the main area.  Points can also be raked in by collecting multiplier icons throughout the level - these add score only once the level is over, so getting through a level without continuing becomes a requirement.  Unfortunately, despite these features, the game is far too short lived an experience.  I was able to get through all five levels in just over twenty minutes on my first time through, and was absolutely surprised to see the credits roll (perhaps in part due to my lack of understanding for what was going on with the story).  The problem, alas, is with the included infinite continues, but if Capcom had removed this feature, we'd have another Zombie Revenge-like experience, where those moments of token-sucking cheapness end up turning into frustration.  Furthermore, after having passed the game with all four characters, I found little to hold my interest.  The included art gallery is somewhat of a joke, as the few included images are all low res.  I don't really have too much trouble with a short game - something like Lords of Thunder, despite being a half hour play through proved to be one of the longest lasting games I've ever played, in fact (we're talking twice a day, for a full year - bow yo' head in respect).  Giga Wing, though, features none of that game's brilliant artistic values.  The graphic design is as generic as they get, and is further hampered by horrid pixelization due to the game's origins on Capcom's CPS-II hardware.  The sound, although featuring an excellent boss tune and a couple of memorable level bgs, is minimal in the area of sound effects, and the presentation for the menus is bare-bones at best.  You want endings or cinematics?  If a couple of still screens and cells fit your bill, then Giga Wing will toot your horn, although I personally expect a whole lot more.  It's not nearly the greatest shooter, but it's some amount of fun for one or two players.  I'm not sure if I'd pay full price for Giga Wing (49.99?  You guys HAVE to be joking), but if you can find it for discount, and if you're a shooting fanatic, go for it.  Maybe if enough people buy it we'll get a port of Silvergun.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jul 26, 2000"}
