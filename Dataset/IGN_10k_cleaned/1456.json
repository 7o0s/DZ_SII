Charles. And this kid loved videogames so much that one day, when he found about $40 in quarters in his brother's dresser drawer, he began to take a few, each day, in order to play games at the local 7-11. Months later, after hours and hours of video gaming, poor Charles was confronted by his brother and family members at the Spaghetti Factory, where tears were shed, and promises of menial labor were made to pay for the stolen quarters. This poor, innocent, nave boy Charles was obviously not guilty -- no, not at all. It was the videogames, that molasses sweet hunger for games like Rally X, Donkey Kong, and Pac-Man that forced him to do it. They told him to do it. They made him do it. If only the games weren't so good, and Charles wasn't so dumb.  Now I know nothing about this Charles fellow, other than that he seems like a completely genuine, likeable, and obviously good looking fellow, but I can definitely understand the addiction to classics like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man. No matter how beautiful and giant games get nowadays, there's just something irreplaceable about twitcher classics like Pac-Man. That's exactly why a game like Pac-Man Adventures in Time is so fantastic - it keeps everything you liked about the original Pac-Man, while adding tons of graphic flair, and enough variety to make you love the seemingly monotonous concept of grazing on power pellets all over again.  So yeah, blah blah blah Pac-Man's traveling through time to eat things and save the world. Forget the plot, enjoy the cute and charming cinematics, and get right into the gameplay, because that's all you'll care about. Like the now-classic update to Pac-Man, Pacmania, the game is in a  perspective, and you can jump over ghosts that get in your way. The jump takes time to charge up, however, which means that you'll have to actually do some dodging in between leaps if you want to successfully chomp your way through the game. The rules are still the same, but the game has changed. Different time periods like the future, prehistoric, and wild west areas offer different problems, each one wilder than the last. One level may have you hopping on Egyptian rooftops in part of the level to get pellets, while another has you wearing special boots to walk around a cube-shaped board. Run out of time with your shoes without recharging them, and you fall off the side. The list goes on and on, and every time you think the designers have exhausted the Pac-Man concept, a new trick is revealed to keep you playing. While the ghosts stay the same, you'll also have to deal with other problems, like hungry crocodiles -- and the ghost now come in different flavors, from kitty ghosts to medieval ghosts, cowboy ghosts, and dinosaur ghosts. You can end your prejudices about the ghost race right now, because Pac-Man AIT shows you that ghosts come in all shapes, colors and sizes, and share a love for life, song, and protecting yellow pellets with their lives.  Everything's in 3D this time around, and the colorful characters and interesting environments ooze with charm. Like Frogger 2, textures are beautiful and full of style, and animations are simple but perfect for the scenery. The camera moves to preset locations to make sure everything's kept logical, and in case you want to get a larger view of the action, most levels also allow you to jump out to a more classic top-down view so you can take a look at the whole board at once.  The music is great -- simple, funky, and without a hint of annoyance. The game might be repetitive at times (it is Pac-Man), but the music definitely isn't. And thank goodness Pac-Man makes short grunts and noises, instead of talking like that horrifying cartoon from the 80's.  Last but not least, there's even a multiplayer component. That's right, you can play LAN, hotseat, or point to point Internet games with up to three other players, or with computer bots if you don't actually have friends. Games include a power pellet munchfest, a ~carry the bomb~ hot-potato game that has you trying to get rid of an explosive before you get nailed, and a ghost tag game that has you as a ghost chasing other gamers in order to get your human self back, and snatch up some pellets. While they're really, really simple in execution, the fact that they've even included a multiplayer component is pretty impressive to me. It may not be Quake III, but it's certainly a lot of fun.  Heck, even the menu system is full of charming animations and style. This game is polished from the top of its fat round head to the bottom of its shiny red shoes. If you're a fan of Pac-Man, of old school games, or if you're just looking for an inexpensive gift for a loved or liked one, then this is your surefire holiday pac pal.   -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
