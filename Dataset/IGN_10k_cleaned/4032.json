While the premise is great, the resulting gameplay is about as painful as getting your leg gnawed off by one of those dead dudes.  Flesh Feast is billed as a team-based action-strategy game. A group of friends has been trapped on a Caribbean island swarming with the undead, and they have to fend for themselves until help arrives. You're given three teammates at the beginning of each stage, and have to guide them through a series of scrolling zombie stomping grounds. All you've got to do is find the key/bomb/crowbar, beat some zombies' heads in, and make your way out of the level. But thanks to some remarkably tedious controls, it's not nearly as simple as you'd think.  Flesh Feast gives you two different gameplay modes, which can be switched on-the-fly. The ~direct~ system lets you control the action in a Tomb Raider- fashion, while the ~strategic~ mode lets you direct the characters a la an RTS game. Unfortunately, neither of these play modes have enough polish to make the game actually enjoyable.  The ~strategic~ mode falls prey to amazingly stupid AI - after I told all three team members to run away from a horde of attacking zombies, they turned around and started brawling again. Worst of all, the AI doesn't quite grasp the concept of combat -- they twitch madly as they flail at the zombies, and quickly become fodder. The ~direct~ mode works a little better, though trying to control all three teammates in this fashion is near impossible. Just let the other two team members get waxed, and you'll have an easier time getting through the level.  While weapons and other useful objects are represented with blue circles on the map screen, keeping them organized is another matter. The inventory system is just as convoluted as that of Resident Evil -- you've got a limited number of slots for all items, and objects crucial to finishing the level (such as keycards) won't be picked up unless there's an open slot. Making matters worse is the fact that your character automatically picks up lopped-off zombie arms and legs as he walks over them. Groan.   The game world is also as dead as the zombies -- even though there are churches, houses, and office buildings, you can't actually enter them. And whatever you do, don't fall into the water -- dropping into the H20 equals instant death. While the Direct3D-accelerated visuals are smooth enough, the characters and environments are noticeably geometric. Slicing off zombie limbs with a chainsaw and other gory sequences are pretty cheesy, with boxy arms and legs bouncing around, followed by a spray of geometrical blood. It's all very underwhelming, and nothing that would get Senator Lieberman up in arms.  All in all, Flesh Feast is yet another unsatisfying action title from SegaSoft. Though re-enacting the shopping mall sequence from Dawn of the Dead was halfway enjoyable, hard-core horror fans should wait it out for Sega's upcoming House of the Dead for some real zombie-blastin' action.  -- Colin Williamson", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
