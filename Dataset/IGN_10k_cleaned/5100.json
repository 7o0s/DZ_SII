Switching between Holmes and his esteemed friend, Dr. Watson, the player will collect evidence, interview witnesses and conduct experiments in order to solve a string of murders. This title is very well put together, with an interesting mystery to solve and lacking the frustration so common with many adventure titles.   The story is intriguing. Holmes is requested to attend a homecoming party, where the host ends up murdered. At first, all suspicion rests on the daughter, but as time passes and more bodies are discovered, the player will find themselves involved in a conspiracy as deep as it is interesting. Sherlock Holmes-typical deductions and observances are scattered throughout the story. The dialogue is well written and biting at times. There are a lot of reports and evidence to read, but all of it is scribed in very interesting ways. Sometimes, the writing can be a little hard on the eyes, but if anything, that adds realism to the tale.   No adventure game is complete with an assortment of puzzles, and Secret of the Silver Earring is no exception. In addition to the ultimate puzzle--solving the crime--there are various mindbenders scattered throughout the game. The puzzles themselves were fantastically created, but if I have one complaint about them, it is that I wish there were more of them. For the observant gamer, none of these challenges would prove difficult. A puzzle might require taking a clue from one of the writings found during the investigation and using it to solve the combination to a safe, for example. Another, probably my favorite, has the player trying to figure out the pattern to a set of cards to choose the correct card to complete the pattern. While it does feel that the number of puzzles is small, they are done in such a way that they complement the story, instead of feeling out of place.    There are five chapters, in the form of five days, to this story. Once everything in one area has been done, Holmes and Watson will automatically move to the next part of the day. At the end of each day, before retiring, a quiz must be completed. This quiz will help the player understand the evidence they have collected. The quiz involves answering yes or no questions and selecting evidence which will corroborate that answer. All of the answers must be correct in order to move on. With a mystery such as this one, having these quizzes highlight what might be important pieces of evidence without giving it away is a unique way of drawing the mind to the possible solutions.     The controls are simple to learn. Movement is point-and-click, and double clicking will cause the character to run to the location. Sometimes, movement can be a little frustrating because of the unclear nature of moving from screen to screen. There's no obvious icon to move from one locale to another. Instead, foot prints will appear to move into another area, but that is not an absolute--sometimes clicking the footprints will just take Holmes to the edge of the current location. This becomes particularly annoying in one section, where moving from one area to another quickly is critical during a timed puzzle. Other than that one puzzle, though, the frustration with movement is minimal.    Finding items is easy. The cursor changes to a hand icon when something can be interacted with. There are a few rare occasions of pixel hunting to find an elusive clue, but objects are generally obvious to the naked eye. Holmes has three tools with which to interact with items: a magnifying glass, a test tube and a measuring tape. Each of these has obvious uses and Holmes will always make mention of what he may need in the dialogue, so there's not much guessing. Back at Holmes residence, a bookshelf often has text that will give more clues to solving the mystery. He also has a small lab, with a microscope and a burner, along with some chemicals. Evidence collected at various crime scenes can be analyzed and more clues revealed in this manner.   The graphics are attractive and animations are smooth. There are a lot of cut-scenes, but most are short and add value to the story. The end cut-scene is well worth playing through the game, and the fact that the game is fun to play through helps as well. Voice acting is above par. Music and sound effects are always appropriate and well done and add much to the setting of the story.While many people proclaim the death of the adventure game genre, the past two years has seen a significant number of good adventure titles. From the Myst series continuing its releases to cute titles like Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon and the upcoming release of Funcom's sequel to The Longest Journey, I would say those people need to look again. Secret of the Silver Earring is another great title to add to this genre's hit list and every lover of these games should pick it up.", "date": "Oct 11, 2004"}
