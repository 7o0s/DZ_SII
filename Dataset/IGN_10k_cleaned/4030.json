You may have scoffed and passed it by because it didn't have any explosions, 30-hit combos, sniper rifles, or just because it's Tennis (well you've got a bad attitude mister!). Don't take us wrong, we salivate at the thought of arcade carnage just like anybody else, but we dare the most cynical gamer to play a versus match from the original and not want to shave their hair like Agassi and don a headband with pride afterward.  Nearly every version of Virtua Tennis released since its debut at the arcades has been respectable, from its brilliant recreation on the Dreamcast, or fun sequel on the PS2, to its impressive portable incarnation on the Game Boy Advance. It only seems natural that the latest N-Gage version would inherit some of the magic that garnered fans in past right? Wrong. We're sorry to say Virtua Tennis for the N-Gage has lost practically every redeeming quality that fans of the original have come to expect.  One of the biggest thrills to be had in past versions of the game was when a volley sustained itself until it reached a level of frenzy that made every hit feel like the game winning shot (as at times it was). In the N-Gage version, volleys are simply too commonplace, and feel more tiresome than exciting. There were times when we wanted to purposefully miss the ball in order to break up the monotony. The overall slow pace of the game is mainly to blame for the lack of excitement. The ball moves across the court at a tedious rate and the act of chasing the ball down feels as if it were taking place in slow motion - it's as if the tennis matches were being held underwater.   Although the N-Gage version is based on a build of a Game Boy Advance title of the same name, it has been stripped of many of the GBA version's fun and innovative features. The GBA game featured more players, an in-depth player creation system, eight creative mini-games, and the all-important four-player option, N-Gage owners are left out in the cold for all of the above.   While the N-Gage version does have a standard set of game modes including Arcade, and World Tour, the most exciting is going head-to-head with another player in Exhibition Mode. The action still runs at a snail's pace, and the number of players is limited to two, but it is still much more interesting when you're playing against a human opponent.   Virtua Tennis may be the first N-Gage game to mesh well with the system's vertical screen orientation. The screen ratio frames the on-court action quite nicely, and the only losses when compared to the GBA version are the two officials perched on either side of the court (who needs them anyway). Courts and player sprites are virtually identical to their GBA counterparts except for their sluggish animations. Cheese-rock guitar music blares in the background, plaguing the series as it always has, and poorly compressed and extremely limited sound effects will have players frantically searching for the mute option. Virtua Tennis could have been a great addition to the N-Gage library, but it unfortunately doesnt make the cut due to its snails pace gameplay and stripped down game modes. If you just have to have a tennis game for your N-Gage, make sure you have someone to play with in multiplayer mode  playing against the computer gets old half way through the first match.", "date": "Oct 18, 2003"}
