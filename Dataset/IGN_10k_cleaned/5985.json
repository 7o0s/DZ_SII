This has left the other players in the arena -- JAMDAT, Glu, and THQ Wireless -- to fight for the 2005 championship ring. JAMDAT's entry, JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006, is the last of the Big Four to release -- and it appears the decision to be late to market has paid off. JAMDAT's game feels complete and has yet to show off any bugs that marred previously efforts to varying degrees.   At first glance, JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 does not appear to be a particular significant step forward for the franchise. The visuals have seen a mild improvement, including the addition of two extra players to the field (it's now eight-on-eight), which may be disappointing at first, but spend time with the game and you will realize that JAMDAT opted instead to use its development time to tweak the game engine. The results offer a fun, easy-to-play foot ball game, but with depth that will appeal to armchair quarterbacks with an eye for detail.   JAMDAT bought in on a full NFL license for JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006. Gamers can play as all of the league teams, as well as play with all updated rosters. Players are noted by name specifically, which feeds into one of my favorite features about the game -- the focus on the star players. Name brand athletes rule sports news; fans just cannot get enough of them. In JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006, the star players really are spotlighted by performing as you would expect. For example, Michael Vicks is an outrageously talented quarterback in real life, and if you choose to play as the Atlanta Falcons, you will notice the incredible strength is getting the ball down field.   One of the series' best features returns in JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006: the playbook. JAMDAT has playbook navigation down to a science. The ease of moving from passing plays to running plays on defense, easily scrolling between options, makes the game far more accessible to beginners than the other mobile football games.   Control is also easy to pick up. The game uses the standard set-up, such as assigning receivers to the ~*~ and ~#~ keys along the bottom of the phone. The icons assigned the receivers turn color depending on the likelihood of a completed pass. If the symbol is green, you're good to go. Throw it when it's red, and the pass will likely be either batted away or simply miss the mark. Worse, it could be intercepted. The kicking meters are also easy to read and use.   JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 player AI seems a little stronger this year, too. Defense is tighter, so the high scoring games you might have seen last year are harder to get. I've found myself squeaking by with 7-3 victories. This isn't to say the scores never get into the exciting 42-21 range, but in the game of inches, it's a little less common.   Other additions to JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 include new penalties, such as offsides and pass interference. Pass interference is a frustrating penalty because it's often not your fault. It's not as rare as I would like it to be, but perhaps that's something that could be tweaked in a 2007 AI routine.   JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 looks good. I played the game on a VX8100, which is indeed a top-of-the-line handset, but the game is not 3D. It's top-down, sprite-based football. The players move around the field quick enough with an acceptable amount of animation. The audio in JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 feature some voice samples that are easy to understand.  JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 rises to the top this year. Of the four footballers I've played this season, I have to recommend JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 as the first choice for both casual and more sim-oriented fans. The smart playbook, the easy controls, the full license, and the noticeable difference the star players make on the games is just too much for the other games to overcome. Glu and EA Mobile would be wise to download JAMDAT Sports' NFL 2006 and study up -- this is your competition. And this year, it kicked your ass.", "date": "Sep 7, 2005"}
