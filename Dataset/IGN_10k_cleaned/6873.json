Previous attempts at the sport have been either been torpedoed by iffy control or undermined with turgid speed issues. Top Spin 2 manages to avoid these pitfalls, but it's still not the absolute answer for mobile tennis.   And at this point, I'm starting to wonder if people should even bother anymore.   Top Spin 2 is based on the Xbox 360 game of the same name from 2K Sports. While the mobile version doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the 360 edition -- and who expected it to? -- it does borrow heavily from the overall look and structure. If you want to play a quick game, you can, but the real meat of this game is the career mode, which allows you to create a tennis star and send him or her up the ranks through training exercises and professional matches.   The training exercises are actually a drag. Sure, pressing through them is necessary to earn skill points that enhance your player stats, but they really aren't that fun. The power training requires you just to hit ten balls, and as you work your way up through the professional ranking, these don't really get much harder. You get to select your training exercises, at least, which allows you to further customize your tennis player.   Playing against human players -- which are licensed -- reveals another problem with Top Spin 2. The AI undermines the challenge. Now, I expect the first few tournament matches to be easy. But come on. Lobbing the ball back and forth without any real attempts to trick you isn't fun. I'm not kidding -- there were rallies that included over 40 volleys back and forth. As you progress, the computer tries some craftier shots, but it really did feel like I had to make an effort to fail.   Control in Top Spin 2 is interesting. You do not actually press a button to hit the ball. If you get in the path of the ball, your player automatically swings their racket. What you look for are small arrows that appear around your player's feet when you step in for a hit. You press in the direction you want to aim the ball. There are also three shot variations -- spin, power, and lob -- you can employ by pressing either *, 0, or #. As you build up your character in the power category, the power shot can become a pretty vicious weapon. But you need to move you player, tap the shot selector, and then aim your ball in rapid succession to pull off an ace. This is not terribly simple, as you can imagine, on a handset.  Top Spin 2 is not a bad tennis game. In fact, it's much better than several I have tried over the years -- such as the abysmal Wimbledon. But it's still just not that fun. The customization and training exercises attempt to offer a little extra depth, but at the end of it all, we're still talking about Pong.", "date": "Apr 28, 2006"}
