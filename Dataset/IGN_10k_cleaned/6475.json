Player X's new Wallace & Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is based on the successful Claymation released by Dreamworks just a couple months back, and it follows the expected route: Take a basic game play premise and slap assets from the license on top of it. In it's favor, though, Wallace & Gromit does have some solid production values between scenes -- but those aren't enough to raise the game out of mediocrity.   Wallace & Gromit is a top-down maze game where Gromit must push boxes around a garden and collect pesky rabbits in his patented Bun Vac. It loosely follows the story of the movie, where Wallace and his canine friend use their inventions to solve a pest problem before a giant vegetable festival. They run afoul of the dastardly Lord Victor Quartermaine, who loosens his nefarious helpers in this game to walk the maze and stop Gromit. These helpers can be trapped by pushing boxes in their way, run over by pushing boxes into them, or blown up with TNT. TNT is often scattered around mazes. By pushing a box into TNT, it explodes -- this usually results in a new passage.   While Gromit completes his duties, a timer counts down. You can pick up bonuses that add precious moments to the timer, which are helpful for players that want to set records. You know, should you ever get into a dispute over who has the best times on Wallace & Gromit.   The problem with Wallace & Gromit is simple: It's just not that fun. Four or five puzzles in, I struggled to keep going. The progression of amusement while playing:   Maze 1: Oh, this is cute.  Maze 2: Well, it's alright.  Maze 3: Okay, well...  Maze 4: Jeez, there's 30 of these...?   These are not the thoughts you want to have only a few minutes after paying $6 for a game.   As mentioned, Wallace & Gromit does have some nice production values. The animated Gromit dropping into the mazes looks good. The between-maze appearances by Wallace are pleasing. And the audio is pretty good. But nicely drawn static portraits of Wallace are not good enough reason to keep slogging through this one.  Wallace & Gromit -- the mobile game -- is dull, unlike the very fantastic movie it is based on. Player X went the easy route is just slapping the titular characters over a very basic maze game. It's the same reason I didn't care for Frogger Puzzle a while back, either. The fellas are better known for their inventions, and I think a lot fun could have been had with those. A Rube Goldberg-style puzzle game, maybe?", "date": "Dec 6, 2005"}
