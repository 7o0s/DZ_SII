Metal Gear Solid 3, God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, and Devil May Cry 3 have all pushed the limits of our imaginations with their excellent concepts and mechanics, and have continued to set standards and expectations as to what a videogame should be. Of course, that left us with an interesting question: ~With the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Special Edition in the midst of this summer's 'Hot Coffee' scandal, how does IGN's 2004 Game of the Year still hold up?~   The answer, not surprisingly, is still ~enormously well.~ Though the game itself doesn't feature anything new by way of content, bug fixes, or storylines (with the exception being that the buried ~Hot Coffee~ mini-game has now been removed), it's still an excellent experience -- and other than a few extras that have been added outside of the software, it remains unchanged. With that in mind, we present below a modified version of the original review that ran more than a year ago with a couple of specific changes. One: the overall opinion of the piece has been skewed a bit to reflect the high quality software that's been released since, and Two: we have now added mention of the bonus extras included in the special edition package. Enjoy!    I'm not going to beat around the bush. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is among the best PlayStation 2 titles I have ever played. It's larger than most of the biggest RPGs, has more story than the heftiest adventure titles, and has almost as many mini-games as Nintendo's Mario Party. Additionally, it has a production value that's second to none, boasts faithfulness to '90s source material with an eerie accuracy, and provides more hours of entertainment than all the previous Grand Theft Autos combined. In short, it's a terrific unending masterpiece of a game -- and one that will never fall victim to an over-exaggeration of its lofty status. It's still one the defining pieces of software for Sony's successful sophomore system, and it's almost impossible to imagine a PlayStation 2 library without it.   Now I realize that with a statement like that, I leave a lot of expectations on the table. Immediate questions from longtime GTA players (and haters) will no doubt surface regarding what kind of problems San Andreas must have. Does the framerate still stutter? Is pop-in and draw distance still an issue? Are there any collision quandaries or other graphics-related bugs? Are the sound effects still tame by other action game standards? Does the AI ever have stupid moments or not perform the way you'd want it to? And is it true that there's absolutely no form of online play whatsoever? To be honest, the answer to all those questions is a definite yes. But an even better question to ask (and one that has a lot more of a direct impact) is, ~Do any of the issues explored above really detract from the overall experience?~ In a word: No.    But how is that possible? Isn't that a significant number of concerns for one game to handle? Sure it may sound like that's the case when they're all clumped together like that, but in practice it's almost completely unnoticeable. For starters, the frequencies at which the graphical hitches mentioned above appear in comparison to when they don't is so lopsided, I'm left unaffected. Additionally, there's literally so much to experience in the single-player game that the lack of online functionality isn't missed at all (while the minor sound effect kinks and other presentational issues get completely dwarfed by everything else the game does right). The big curiosity, of course, is just what is it that San Andreas does so right in the first place? To be brief, it's the first game I can ever remember that asks players to wonder ~What can't you do~ as opposed to ~What can you?~    Johnson N The Hood  The storyline of San Andreas should feel somewhat familiar to fans of 1990s cinema. Borrowing rather heavily from John Singleton, Spike Lee, and Ernest Dickerson pictures, this iteration of GTA is all about the thug life when it was still in its infancy. Following the exploits of young Carl Johnson, the game begins as CJ returns from his exile in Liberty City when he learns that his mother has been killed. Carl is pretty torn up about coming back too, because the whole reason he left Los Santos in the first place is because his younger brother Brian was gunned down five years ago. Nevertheless, family is family and Carl returns home to pay his respects.   Within seconds of arriving in Los Santos, however, CJ is met by two bastardly police officers: Frank and Eddie. Rotten to the core, the pair of crooked cops robs Carl of all his money, frames him for the death of a fellow officer that's on to their schemes, and tosses him into the middle of enemy gang territory. Weaponless and outnumbered, CJ is forced to run back to his old neighborhood to try and survive. Once resolved, things really begin to take off and players will meet a huge assortment of characters -- CJ's older brother Sweet, his sister Kendl and her boyfriend Caesar, Carl's buddies Big Smoke and Ryder, and massive galleries of supporting personalities all weave an intricate plot for an overall great storyline.    In fact, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas probably has the best narrative of any of the GTAs thus far. It's certainly more multifaceted than 2002's Vice City and offers up a large selection of interwoven and completely independent plot threads that really help tell an effective story. And while the characters don't grow or evolve the same way they would in an adventure game or an RPG (save for CJ), they're still vastly different from one another and do a great job of keeping things interesting. Those that are ethically opposed to the content of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, however, aren't going to find anything different this time either. The plot is still brutal, the characters are still ruthless, and the moral of the story is that there isn't really a moral. So yes, this still isn't the type of fairy tale you'll want to show to your children (unless you want to show them what NOT to do); but for adults who love crime dramas, action films, and gangsta rap, the devices here are strong and offer up a great deal of twists, turns, and interesting visceral situations. It even ties in rather nicely with Vice City and GTA3 for fans of the series.   Menace II Three Societies  One of the reasons that the game is so impressive is because of its technology. No longer restricted to just a single city, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is huge: almost six times the size of Vice City and even more so than GTA3. Broken into three major metropolises (Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas) the map's major designations are separated by countryside, desert, mountains, and a dozen smaller towns in-between. Though not an official time stamp by any means, it took me more than half an hour to drive from the southern-most part of Los Santos into the west through San Fierro -- and then Northeast into Las Venturas. Keep in mind; I didn't stop for anything along the way and avoided traffic as best I could. I didn't stop off at any of the smaller towns either. Enormous doesn't even begin to describe how big this monster really is.    Making the trip even more jaw dropping is the fact that the entire state of San Andreas streams entirely off the disc -- with no loading screens to be found except for when transitioning to the indoors or when activating missions at key points. Even then, the waiting time tops off at about five to six seconds before starting again. Vice City worked on this same technology, but the number of framerate hitches and pop-in issues are much lower here than before. Granted, you will run into slowdown and a few bizarre glitches here and there, but as I said, its frequency is more than forgivable when weighed against how smoothly the game usually runs    What specifically caught my eye about the world of San Andreas, though, is the fact that it's a true mini-society. The dynamic climate, for example, differs quite drastically from area to area. The San Francisco-inspired city of San Fierro, for example, is frequently cursed with a mixture of fog, rain, and overcast afternoons. Los Santos, on the other hand, is surrounded by a constant haze brought on by the area's terrible level of pollution, while Las Venturas is almost always sunny thanks to its arid climate. These weather patterns behave just as they do in real life too, which means climates change from time to time. DJs on the radio will even mention these weather breakups and inform players when they can expect to see alterations.   But there's more to recreating a mini-society than just simulating a bunch of weather patterns. Rival gangs, for example, are at constant war with one another -- so don't be surprised if you see members of the Orange Grove Families blasting away at rival Ballers while you drive through the city streets. Cops will stop and bust them for their crimes just as quickly as they'd bust you as well, making it easier to get away with robbing or killing if they've already got their hands full with somebody else. Additionally, people on the streets will make comments to CJ based on his appearance. If Carl's fat and out of shape, for instance, he'll be ridiculed. But if he's buff and well-dressed, on the other hand, the townspeople will recognize that too. Of course, this is just one example of how the world is alive, as you can also expect to see drug pushers making deals, citizens running for their lives from criminals, and normal everyday fender benders happening between AI drivers.    But that's only scratching the surface: cars can rust and get dirty the more you use them unless they're washed; traffic flows more heavily during the morning and evening hours to mirror real-life rush hours; pedestrians change clothing styles and speech patterns based on the towns they live in; construction workers holler and whistle at women as they walk by; and cops make a much more concerted effort to follow their targets until they're completely out of sight. Sure it may not be The Sims, but for what it is it's damn extensive.   How Do U Want It?  Naturally, it would only make sense to allow CJ to be just as alive as the world in which he lives; and that's exactly what Rockstar has enabled him to do. By far one of the most dramatic improvements that have been made since Vice City, the ability to customize CJ is more than just presentational -- it also has a direct effect on how you can play. Cycling, driving, holding your breath underwater, and riding motorcycles are all skills that can be improved upon by doing them more often. And the more you do them, the easier they become. What's so cool about this is that none of these skills have to be worked on in order for CJ to be successful; your own ability with the dual shock and some determination is really all you need. For those of us that enjoy role-playing-type games, however, it's a great incentive to try things we normally wouldn't.    These kinds of improvements aren't just limited to how responsive your vehicles control either. Dressing well, keeping fit, and increasing the amount of respect that you have in the eyes of other thugs can be improved upon as well. Should you let yourself go and become a fat slob, for example, you'll be less likely to earn points for your Sex Appeal stat in order to woo the ladies for those always-fun girlfriend side-missions (plus it'll be harder for you to increase your stamina attribute). If you head to the gym and jump on the treadmill or bench-press, however, you can burn the fat consumed by eating food and turn it into muscle and increased stamina. Your new buff bod not only makes you more attractive to the ladies and better respected by your homeboys, but it also makes your melee attacks more powerful and your ability to sprint last longer. There are a number of other customizable goodies at CJ's disposal as well. Clothes can be bought at several different garment stores, Haircuts and tattoos can be added, and depending on the quality of your appearance, you'll evoke bigger reactions out of women and fellow gang members.     Fantastic (High Speed) Voyage  The vehicles in San Andreas handle extremely well. Fans of the previous title's cars, trucks, and motorcycles should be pleased to know that in addition to several new vehicles made specifically for this game, a great deal of the older autos have been incorporated here as well -- only with an ~updated~ 90s look. Keep in mind, though, that the 1990s look really isn't the update that matters here; it's the vastly-improved handling system and dead-on physics engine. I guarantee you that you'll be able to tell the difference between San Andreas' and Vice City's automobiles immediately; each and every vehicle in the game has its own unique suspension, weight, and speed limit.   Fans of the car modification craze that invaded the racing genre are in for a treat too -- as they'll be able to pimp out their rides with a huge assortment of mods that allow them to upgrade their front and rear bumpers, tires, upholstery, and just about anything else. But these modifications do more than just make your car look better... they also raise your respect level with fellow gang members and increase your sex appeal stat with the ladies. Moreover, upgrading your ride with a hydraulics system (controlled via the right analog stick) enables you to partake in a mini-game centered on bumping your car to different selections of music. You can even add a nitro pack to the back of your car for an extra boost when speeding up.    Of course, there's a ton of other cool vehicle-based additions to San Andreas as well. The BMX bicycle, for instance, is a strangely addictive supplementary ride that allows players to drive it like a motorcycle for cruising or tap the X button like crazy for serious high-velocity action. If you want to get stylish, you can even perform various extreme sports-like stunts -- including stoppies, bunnyhops, 180s, 360s, wheelies, and a few others that I can't seem to pull off without smashing into the pavement. Additionally, there's a colossal list of automobiles that are brand new to the GTA series that include a devastating combine that chops its victims into goo, a super-responsive dune buggy, a hilarious street sweeper that's essentially an urban tractor with brushes, and a sweet little hovercraft. For flight jockeys, various kinds of airplanes and helicopters have come back into the fold as well, and there's a nice selection of super secret vehicles you've probably already uncovered. Players can even hijack trains if they're looking for a way to pass the time, and San Fierro tourists can take city trolleys if they're in the mood for a little something different.   Needless to say, it seems that Rockstar realized that after creating a land area as large as San Andreas that it would have to seriously re-approach its thinking when it came to the handling of cars. There are a ton of things in this regard that I haven't even mentioned yet too, like the improved AI of carjacking victims, the ability to pick up hitchhikers, a super-sweet Monster truck that can crush other vehicles, more realistic boat physics, and a ton of other related things that are better left to your experience rather than a descriptor.     The Player's Club  Of all the improvements made to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, however, the most important are the enhancements to the existing gameplay mechanics. Though similar to Vice City in that you can still lock on to enemies with the R1 button and cycle through targets with the L2 and R2 keys, the system is much smarter than it was before. One of the biggest complaints in Vice City, for instance, was that the target-cycle would lock onto dead enemies as well as live ones -- costing you valuable firefight time and making missions more frustrating than they should be. Now that problem is completely fixed with a much more accurate (and faster) cursor that locks onto the biggest threat in front of you until it's completely eliminated.    Rockstar has also incorporated several of the gunplay elements from 2003's brutal stealth actioner Manhunt. Players can move, fire, and zoom in on their opponents all at the same time with deadly accuracy. The optional manual targeting camera (which can be activated at any time with the right analog stick) feels terrific and enables players to pinpoint specific locations on their victims. To supplement this feature, your proficiency with each weapon is increased each time you fire it -- which opens up new abilities as your skills progress. When mastering the micro sub-machine guns, for example, players will eventually gain the ability to strafe and fire their weapons simultaneously while wielding two guns instead of one. Hand-to-hand combat has also been drastically upgraded with a wider variety of moves, the option to learn new techniques at gyms across the state, and the incorporation of a limited combo system.   But the targeting system isn't the only aspect of Manhunt that San Andreas has claimed for its own, as it's taken its stealth-oriented mechanics as well. Though not as important in comparison, the need to crouch in the shadows and sneak up behind your victims adds a nice touch. In truth, the stealth missions are among my favorites: with the heavy breathing of CJ the only sound you can hear while sneaking from place to place and silently cutting throats. These sequences aren't nearly as brutal, graphic, or meticulous as they were in Manhunt either, which makes them feel a little safer for your conscious. Then again, that's really what makes San Andreas so appealing in the first place -- its ability to consistently present players with missions that introduce all-new gameplay features while making everything feel important regardless of whether they're directly tied into the storyline or not.     But stealth is only one example of the many different kinds of missions that players can look forward to. San Andreas does offer more than 100 different quests and challenges after all, and boasts everything from the sneaky stuff mentioned above to escort missions, stealth-oriented home robberies, on-rails shooting situations, traditional car races, and lots, lots more. There's even an unparalleled selection of mini-games to undertake in your spare time -- including a Dance Dance Revolution-type rhythm challenge, a small collection of arcade games that play exactly like Tempest, Asteroids, and Defender, and a fully-realized pool game that has its own physics system and betting option. Don't forget, you can bet on horse races, gamble with nearly every known casino game, and even team up with a second player for two-person rampages as well.   Presentation Rules  Graphics fiends will probably be San Andreas' biggest enemies. Though it has been improved upon in several ways technologically when compared to Vice City, it still has a lot of the pop-in, framerate, and collision issues I mentioned earlier. In the game's defense, however, the sheer number of objects, vehicles, and land area being displayed on the screen at once is so impressive that it's more than forgivable. In a perfect world, these snags wouldn't rear their ugly heads at all, but given the power of the PS2 and how much activity is going on in the game, it's hard to imagine it getting any smoother than it already is without several more months (years?) of optimization (and the Xbox version didn't make that big of improvement with the extra power anyway).    I do have to admit, though, that it's still disappointing that progressive scan isn't an option for us High Definition users. But at least widescreen mode is fully supported and it looks great on the televisions that can handle it. I'm also happy to report that those bothersome trails from the previous two games have been removed entirely.   The rest of the game, however, looks fantastic and provides a terrific amalgamation of the all the popular landmarks taken from all over Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. The Watts Towers, Lombard Street, the Las Vegas Strip, the Great Western Forum, are just a few of hundreds of different recognizable areas. The number of polygons for each object has been nearly doubled from Vice City too, and the number of animations, particle effects, and weather patterns are more realistic than ever.    What really stands out for me, though, is the absolutely kick-ass soundtrack and voice acting. Boasting a cast that includes Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Penn as Officers Tenpenney and Polaski, James Woods as Mike Toreno, and Charlie Murphy as a self-absorbed pimp named Jizzy, the talent available here is top notch. Up and coming rapper Young Malay is perfect in his role as CJ too, while all the supporting characters are of Hollywood caliber.   The soundtrack is just as strong, and in many ways, much better than Vice City's was. Classic 90s staples like the Stone Temple Pilots, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Guns 'N Roses, and Boyz II Men make up a rather extensive eleven-station presentation. The commentary is completely dynamic too -- with sounds that differ based on what kind of car you're driving and what kind of adjustments have been made to its sound system. Strangely there's no DTS this time around, but we did get Dolby Pro Logic II.    While we're on the subject of presentation, owners of the new Special Edition version of the game can also look forward to two bonus discs with extra content on them. The first, and by far the more interesting for players, will probably be ~The Introduction~ -- the same 30-minute movie that accompanied the smaller San Andreas soundtrack late last year. It offers some awesome background info on all the characters and their motivations coming into the opening events of San Andreas, and on the whole is pretty damned cool. The second disc is a slickly-produced full-length documentary known as ~Sunday Driver~ and tells the story of Compton's Low-riding ~Majestics~ club. Gearheads and Mod freaks will likely dig this, but its mixed messages and tendency to preach (and preach inaccurately, I might add) about the lawfulness of low-riding can wear on the nerves.Time is a funny thing. In the many months since I last played and loved Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, several new games have come along that make me question my original stance that this is the PS2's best overall game. God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, and several replays of Metal Gear Solid 3 and ICO certainly don't help its case. But the fact remains that San Andreas is still one of the very best and most complete videogames you'll ever buy for this generation and it always will be. Besides, with more than 80 hours of content, plenty of hidden stuff, an excellent storyline, and a few dozen other elements I've already touched on, there are more than enough reasons for you to run out and buy this sucker right now.......That is, of course, unless you already own the original version that graced store shelves before the whole Hot Coffee fiasco. If that's the case (and it most likely is considering how many units of that were actually sold), then there's really no reason to pick up a second copy. Collectors, completists, and car freaks notwithstanding.", "date": "Nov 18, 2005"}
