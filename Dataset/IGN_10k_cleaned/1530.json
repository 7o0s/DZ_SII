This latest addition falls into the ~football~ category -- or as we silly Americans like to call it: soccer. But unlike all other soccer titles on the N64, this one doesn't feature loads of testosterone sweaty men -- more like loads of testosterone sweaty women, led by superstar Mia Hamm herself.  This bit of software was originally seen in Europe under the name Michael Owen's World League Soccer, but of course featured an entire cast of male player models. Now publisher SouthPeak Interactive and developer Silicon Dreams have decided to bring the code to North America where gamers might be more familiar with a face such as Miss Hamm. While the original European version of the game was a fairly mediocre title for PAL systems, the gender twist and updated translation to American shores does not necessarily guarantee that this title with be worth your time or funds.  The Facts  For one to four players simultaneously 32 international and 18 U.S. women's soccer teams to choose from Four play modes: Exhibition, U.S. League Season, World Cup, and Practice Player substitutions and formation changes during gameplay, allowing you to switch assignments and arrange players on the field to your liking In-game tutorial tips for control and strategy Configurable camera distance, height, and angle 10 second instant replay Save game data and options via Controller Pak Rumble Pak support  Gameplay When you pick up a controller to play a game of soccer on the N64, you would probably know what to expect based on any previous knowledge of the sport and how such other soccer titles have played in the past. And so as you go hands-on with Mia Hamm Soccer 64, it is disappointing to find that the expected quick reflexes and precision ball-movement have been substituted for sloppy handling and sub-par gameplay in general. The game features two modes of control: easy and professional. The professional option attempts to give players the ability to perform dozens of soccer maneuvers and fancy footwork, but instead is so overcomplicated and unintuitive that the game is practically unplayable. Unless you are willing to devote a small part of your life to mastering this setup, players are much better off controlling their teams with the easy control setup. This mode is still slightly cumbersome, but at least you can manage to make it past midfield without fumbling over the buttons and passing the ball to the opposing team.   The controls consist of all the standard soccer functions -- pass, shoot, turbo, etc. None are ever done with grace or style, but they do work to a degree. One glaring omission in the control department is the ability to manually switch players on defense. There's no telling what the developers were thinking here, but you simply can not decide for yourself when to switch to the player closest to the ball. Instead, the computer automatically decides for you, and suddenly the player you've been pursing with is lost and you are now running the wrong way with a new defender entering the screen. This single issue is going to drive most gamers absolutely crazy, especially those used to the far superior EA and Konami soccer titles.  The players themselves have been cursed with less than average AI and are particularly dimwitted in general. There's not much to worry about on your own team as you'll be controlling most of the action, but the intelligence of the opposing players is severely lacking and makes for a frustrating (albeit humorous) soccer experience. One such example is watching them dribble the ball down the field and then continue to proceed directly out of bounds with no other players in sight. It doesn't happen constantly but is a perfect example of the lacking detailed logic routines given to the players that run around on the field. If a sports game has noticeably poor computer AI, then gamers will usually pick up on it very quickly, and such a game will instantly become rather generic and bland because of it. Unfortunately, this title is one of them and will no doubt leave soccer fans with the exact same tasteless sensation. The game as a whole is just a bit too glitchy, with the occasional freeze sure to frustrate you just as much as the simplistic AI.  The physics implemented in Mia Hamm Soccer 64 are actually not bad considering the other apparent holes in the software. Balls will bounce, roll, and skid down the turf rather realistically, and it's nice to see such a critical area of the game produced properly for a change. The players also sport good body physics and collision detection; you'll be sure to notice that you can't run directly through a group of opposing players without tripping, stumbling, and loosing the ball in the process. It's a nice touch of realism that comes at a bit of surprise, given the standard level of quality in all other gameplay related areas.  And hey, we can't forget to mention everyone's favorite part: framerate. The good news is that the gameplay itself actually runs fairly smooth, and the framerate won't impede your ability to enjoy the other lacking areas of the game. But the bad news is that nearly every other bit of 3D imagery that is rendered on the screen suffers from severe slowdown. The pre-game display of players taking the field averages one to two frames per second tops -- corner and goal kicks are the same. This is most likely due to the wide-angle shots of the stadium, which feature an extremely blurry and animated collection of beige sprites jittering up and down in their seats. It's very ugly, very unnecessary, and the game performance takes a very big hit because of it. But fortunately the gameplay is relatively safe from the blurry mess of a stadium depending on your selected in-game camera angle.  Graphics Well, the textures on the field and players look pretty good from a distance, but that's about it really. No matter how close you zoom in, you really can't tell that these are women -- their faces look manlier than most men's soccer games. The low-count polygon models they are fixed upon are borderline stick figures and are way too angular in design compared to other N64 software today. Player animations are decent, but a bit too twitchy and jumpy -- they could use a few more frames to really smooth them out. Some weather effects were added such as the rings of water splashing under feet, and these do help to spice up the visuals if only a bit. But let's not bring up the grotesquely blurry crowd again. Typically the graphics of a game must fall secondary to gameplay considerations, but it appears that this game proves the opposite with weak visuals that manage to outshine the even weaker gameplay elements.  Sound Nonexistent. None. The game is virtually silent -- an audio ghost town. And frankly, this just doesn't make a bit of sense considering the loud and frantic sport that the game portrays. There are only three sound effects to be heard during the entire game: a whistle, a kick, and a crowd. You'll hear the exact same ~poot~ sound of a foot meeting the ball over and over during gameplay, making the whistle a very rare treat indeed. The crowd is very faint and full of static -- only the occasional chants come close to breaking through the garbled noise of stadium fuzz. And to add insult to injury, all of these effects are very soft and of very poor audio quality. The game does feature some in-game commentary, presumably by Mia Hamm herself, but it consists of only quick one-liners like, ~moving ahead~ or, ~taking a shot.~ It gets very repetitive and stale in a hurry, so once you mute her in the options menu, you are left with the few previously mentioned minor sounds that the game has to offer.The sport of soccer is known for being fast, dynamic, and full of energy -- this game of videogame soccer, on the other hand, is not exactly a fair representation of the sport on any front. The control is mildly responsive, but not tight. The animations are appropriate, but not smooth. The graphics get the job done, but leave much to be desired. It really doesn't matter if this game features men or women players, since you'll never really tell the difference in terms of both visuals and gameplay. So our advice is to simply suppress your desire for some Mia Hamm loving and stick with Konami's International Superstar Soccer titles as the continuing best soccer effort on the N64.", "date": "Nov 23, 2000"}
