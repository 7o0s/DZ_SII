That's the folly of journalism - you're just one voice amongst the masses. What make IGN a little different is that we can take different angles within the site; each region can cover any game and apply any mark - within reason of course. For Resistance, the US clearly loved the title, giving it a very generous 9.1. The UK were a little less convinced by the experience (a respectable 8.0), and having logged a lot of hours into both the single and multiplayer components of the game, we tend to side with them.   Resistance is a good game; really good in fact. We enjoyed the story - an alternate, early 1950s encounter with aliens who are spreading outwards from Russia, slowly infecting the population and wreaking havoc as they move. We enjoyed the typically brilliant weapons - a trademark of Insomniac Games' other series, Ratchet & Clank. We savoured the 40-player multiplayer games, where chaos reigned and bullets rained. But the whole of Resistance, the overall experience of playing the final game, just doesn't blow our collective skirts up the way we hoped it would.   The game kicks off in Europe of the early 1950s; in an alternate past where World War II never happened, but something equally devastating is waiting to emerge - an alien race known as the Chimera, who are infecting humans, abducting them and rapidly taking over Europe. The nations of the world unite to try and drive the threat back and this is where they lay their scene and gamers take on the role of U.S. Army Ranger Sgt. Nathan Hale, who himself is infected, but seemingly resistant to the alien virus.   It's a great premise, combining two of the most heavily played-out genres in FPS history. Insomniac has never gone on record with how long it took to put the title together, but we'd wager the development time was around a year, excluding early conceptual designs. If that was the case, they've done a bang-up job.    Hale, Resistance's heartthrob lead, out for blood.  Resistance is not a short game - it'll take you 15 hours to get through the single player game at a good pace. The first few areas of the game are arguably some of the least interesting - which is all well and good if you're willing to stick it out, but the linearity of the levels rarely improves, even if the set-pieces do.    See, for a game that revolves around tried-and-proven formulas - waves of troops, corridors, jump pads, swarms of giant clawed insects - it rarely breaks away from that formula. It's almost as if Insomniac might as well have created a straight-up sci-fi shooter, or stuck with the WWII genre completely, for all the genuine influence it has on the gameplay.   That's not to say that Resistance isn't a very solid, fun and entertaining shooter - it is; it just won't surprise you if you've ever played another shooter before. Outside of the weapons, which we'll get to shortly, you've seen it all before. All of it.   There's the 'drive a tank through the streets, blowing apart everything' moment. There's the 'man the turrets and mow down a wave of aliens' moment. There's the 'work your way through the underground tunnel network' moment. This stuff is fun, sure, but it's not really representative of the kind of originality that separates the Halos and Half-Lifes from the Killzones and Call of Duty 3s. In terms of mission structure, there is very little complexity. Generally, Resistance is a 'shoot first, ask questions never' kind of game. Puzzles are very infrequent; challenges come more in the realm of breaking through enemy strongholds, defeating the occasional massive alien and activating switches to open doors.   The power of the PlayStation 3's processor is put to the test through the complexity of battle sequences. We were truly wowed by the number of things going on - grenades exploding, flanks of enemies goring UK and US troops, the sky constantly full of arcing ammunition and you're caught up in the middle of it.    There is definitely a lot of geometry being thrown around, but it isn't consistent throughout the game.  The combat is - again - a cross between the fine, down-the-scope firing of Call of Duty with the melee of Halo and a carefully selected blend of the group tactics of the two. The Chimera, and later the Cloven, are moderately intelligent, but not surprisingly so. For instance, they know how to stay out of your line of sight and take pot-shots at you, but if you confront them head-on and unload a clip, they won't retreat - they'll just take the rounds in the chest, while trying to do the same to you. They also don't have the greatest distance-vision, either, which can be used to your advantage.   The real innovation is found in the weaponry on offer. If you've ever played a Ratchet & Clank title, you'll appreciate the warped minds of the guys over at Insomniac. They love great guns that do crazy things. Though you won't find cow launchers, the game starts with the predictable machinegun with a grenade launcher as secondary, before taking off into an amazing array of clever alien wares. Our favourites include the Auger, which fires rounds capable of travelling through walls and other objects, gathering power with each layer through which it passes (and a holographic shield as a secondary function); and the anti-aircraft, shoulder-mounted rocket launcher. This puppy lets you fire a rocket into the air, only to stop it and redirect it, allowing you to target enemies around corners or on the other side of the battlefield. Nice.    Then there's the bouncing, rebounding bullets, explosive bubbles of acid that can be stacked, hung and detonated, pulses of electricity and more - all up, 12 weapons with secondary functions. Some are definitely gimmicky and you'll try 'em once, fool around, and go back to something more practical. Still others, such as the humble double-barrel shotgun, come into their own in the multiplayer modes.      It is in the multiplayer, in fact, that Resistance goes a good way towards redeeming its single player shortcomings. There is more goodness crammed into this half of the game (and it legitimately is half of the experience - you're missing out if you don't take your PS3 online and enter into the fray) than most of the other PS3 launch titles, with the obvious exception being MotorStorm.   40 players can get into the action - more than any other console shooter in history. And because the games are being hosted on servers provided by Sony, there is no lag - or at least, none that we've encountered in even the most frantic, chaotic encounters. And boy, do they get out of control.   The maps are adjusted for the number of players in the field, scaled up and down accordingly. Taking place in grungy and diverse city-based locations, the settings are filled with landmarks that make orienting yourself far less of a chore than you might expect, given the scale of the maps.   Even with 40 players duking it out, the online play was buttery. Removing the need to host a game might seem restrictive, but it's also not an issue for creating games, either. You can still create a mode, specify weapons, limits, extra conditions and a heap of other tweakable factors - only, instead this is all presumably sent to the server which sets up the scenario for all to enjoy, minus the lag-fest.   Ah, so we meet again, generic shooter components!  Part of keeping the action fluid should also be credited to the game engine, which varies in visual quality greatly. At some moments, down certain paths and through some rooms, you'd swear you were looking at a PS2 game for the lack of texture detail, while in other areas environmental objects are particularly lacking. Houses and other buildings are often devoid of objects, and though it could be argued that such details add little, it gives the game an inconsistent feel, particularly because other buildings are absolutely crammed with the details you'd expect. From empty and bland to fleshed out and back again, it's a little strange. On a more technical level, bump-mapping is used to moderate effect - you won't find an insane level of clarity on any surface, character faces withstanding.    The sound effects, on the other hand, are truly impressive - some excellent use of environmental surround sound ensures that there is a richness and unique effect for every round you fire, impact you land and explosion that shakes the earth. Voice-acting is solid, but unremarkable - the 'charming' quips of your armed compatriots are a little grating after the first few hours.   It all comes together well, but this isn't a graphical showcase for the PS3 in the same way that games like MotorStorm or Fight Night: Round 3 are. But that's okay in our books - we'd prefer solid gameplay in a launch title over pretty-but-hollow releases this early into the PS3's life.    We also appreciated the 'achievement'-like skill points system, whereby you get a little notification if you pull off impressive marksmanship, gutsy killing-sprees and unusual kills. The game tracks these demonstrations of skill in both single and multiplayer modes, and is viewable by other players while in lobbies. The more you succeed in your online skirmishes, the better your military ranking, too - your current 'stripes' level is displayed next to your username for all to see.   This is currently the premier shooter on the PS3 - but that's not saying a whole lot right now. It's definitely not breaking fresh ground in any one area, apart from some excellent multiplayer facilities, but in lieu of Killzone 2, we'd take a sequel to Resistance: Fall of Man any day of the week. Is it worth the price of PS3 admission? Well, that depends on how much you love your shooters. But when you factor in MotorStorm too, these might just hold enough clout to sway your wallet towards the cashier.What do you think of Resistance: Fall of Man?
