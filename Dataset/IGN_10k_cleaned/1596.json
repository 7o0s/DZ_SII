Those vintage Hanna-Barbera characters from Scooby-Doo are on the case again as they stumble into one mystery after another. Scoob' and the Gang find their way to the N64 courtesy of publisher THQ and developer Terra Glyph. Can this videogame incarnation of a cult-hit cartoon show deliver the fun?  Fans of the show may find the mystery they seek, but the truth is that as you chase down one clue after another you may find yourself a bit exhausted.   Features   One-player action Play as the classic duo Shaggy and Scooby Solve three classic mysteries Cartoon-style graphics Top-down camera  Exclusive never-before-seen mystery   Gameplay There's a whole generation that was bred on Scooby-Doo and the license continues to exist and generate fanfare even today with new episodes. With that in mind THQ has brought that to the Nintendo 64 for all gamers to enjoy. Or, at least try to enjoy. Players take hold of the most popular and comical character among the Scooby-Doo gang, Shaggy. Oh, but that's not all, you'll also get to have Scooby, the star of it all follow you around. What purpose does he serve? We'll touch on that later. Scooby-Doo: Classic Creep Capers, as it's called, looks to take you through three different mysteries that were aired on TV. Many fans will remember the episodes entitled, ~What a Night for a Knight,~ ~That's Snow Ghost,~ and ~A Tiki Scare is No Fair.~   In each episode you steer Shaggy through the levels picking up clues and items to use to trap the villain. Until you find everything in each level, you won't be able to pass it. The clues and items are almost always blinking or blatantly placed so there's no confusion. However, occasionally you'll have to keep a keen eye out for the clues because they're hidden in secret areas. One example of this is meddling with a mummy case to find yourself a bag of sand. When you finally find all of the clues and items, the gang will agree upon a plan to trap the masked marauder. Then you and Scooby (go figure) will have to lure him into the trap. It's so classic it's predictable. And the developers would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids.  To indulge yourself in this mystery you'll have no problems because the control setup is relatively simple. The A-button is used to do everything. You press it to search for things, pick up items, talk to people, and everything in between. The only other button you really use is the R-button, which opens up your menu screen. It's just a matter of tapping the A-button to set the item active and use it or give it to the gang as to help solve the mystery. It's a very simple system, and helps keep the adventure pretty separate from good dexterity.  Unfortunately actually moving your character from room to room throws a giant monkey wrench in the whole system. Classic Creep Capers features an overhead camera system similar to Resident Evil. The static camera doesn't pose the problem, though. It's when you walk from one room to another that bad things start to happen. Because the camera angles will change from room-to-room, the direction to walk away from the room prior to that has to change. This causes major problems because until you let go of the control stick the default directions will still relate back to the previous room. So to better help you understand, think of it this way: You exit one part of a room by past the left-most border. The camera repositions itself so if you keep pressing left you'll exit the new room. To remedy this the developers, Terra Glyph, default to the previous room's controls. You're supposed to let go of the control stick as you enter each new room so the controls will set themselves according to the new camera angle, but instinctively you don't want to do that. It sounds confusing because it is. You'll end up getting yourself caught up in a chase and running into walls or objects or back into the room you just exited. It's very disorienting and should have never been implemented.    On top of all this Scooby actually poses a problem as well when it comes to controlling you character. Now, you would think that Scooby would be a source of laughter during most of your searching for clues. He follows you around and often says ~Ruh-roh~ or ~Hee! Hee! Hee!~ It appears to be an attempt at comical relief, but the voice effects are brief and soon prove to be very repetitive. As it turns out Scooby is one of the most annoying additions to the title aside from the impractical camera system. Scoob' was designed to follow you around, but he ends up getting in your way most of the time. As much as we love Scooby-Doo, we called him a dirty mutt on several occasions because he would get in our way and even ended up getting us ~killed~ now and then.  If he stays out of your way he's fine to have around, but if he doesn't he'll hinder your game.   How does one get ~killed~ in Scooby? Well, technically you don't. You have a courage meter which is essentially a life meter. Every time something scares Shaggy and Scooby they'll lose some courage (energy). They can be scared by running into spiders or merely gazing at something creepy. Each time the characters get scared, the game pauses to feature a ~shake~ animation. It gets a little annoying not being able to walk every time you get freaked. The only way to replenish your energy is to find Scooby snacks that are strewn throughout the level, or to head into the kitchen (naturally ever quest has one) to make a giant sandwich. Making a sandwich is actually one of the more involving parts of the mystery. You have to guide Shaggy's hands to catch pieces of bread and meat as Scooby flings them from the refrigerator.   The overall feel of the title is fairly true to the series. The characters, while they don't look exactly like the originals, couldn't be mistaken for anyone else. Classic fans of the series might enjoy being a part of the mystery, but the sad fact is that this title is a bit tedious and boring. The control problems just add insult to injury. However, it is a product clearly aimed at a younger crowd. Still, even as straightforward as the gameplay is, the control problems will take anyone out of the fun, especially children.    Graphics Interestingly enough, the graphics are probably the best part the game. Most of the textures are fairly low resolution, but all the levels are laid out with a clean variety of them. The Museum exhibits differ in atmosphere from prehistoric to modern and the log cabin hotel feels warm and cozy throughout most of the inside. Terra Glyph even threw in a few Hanna-Barbera cameos for fun such as framed pictures of the Flintstones. The animation is also very cartoony and gets the job done. Much of it moves just like the show. It's not exactly the standard for perfect N64 animation, but it's on par with most average N64 titles these days.   Sound Classic Creep Caper's features plenty of spooky or high-energy themes that are reminiscent of the show. There's nothing that will blow your eardrums out here, but it does a good job of keeping the atmosphere. Most of the music usually changes as you enter different rooms. The sound effects, however, prove to be pretty bland. They're pretty average and predictable, but they fill the blanks. Most of the effects are the sound of your footsteps or a villain in the distance. The biggest disappointment is the lack of character voice. Save Scooby's occasional ~Rhaggy,~ there's nearly no voice. Considering that the voice was one of defining factors of the show, this is a big letdown. Scooby-Doo: Classic Creep Capers is pretty devoid of intriguing gameplay. You jump into the game looking for mystery and you end up with a scavenger hunt. Most of the enjoyment comes in the thrill of finally unmasking the villain (who you probably already know). I actually like slow-paced games. I was a big fan of titles like Myster Mansion or Myst or King's Quest for the PC, and even though Scooby-Doo here is in the same vein, it's pretty shallow. Again, it's the type of mystery that kids might enjoy. You go out and search for stuff, bring it back to the gang for analysis, and bag yourself the villain at the end. My advice to you readers is to rent if you're remotely interested in this. Otherwise you're going to have a pricey version of ~go fetch.~ If you're a hardcore fan and must have it, well prepare for a mediocre experience.", "date": "Dec 6, 2000"}
