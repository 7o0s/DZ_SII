Amped is the second snowboarding title to release on the system, and not the last to ship before the end of the year. It's a benchmark example of the power of the Xbox. The levels are huge, the draw distance is... is there a draw distance? Animations are smooth, the details are tight, and your ears are treated to 150 songs of original music from a myriad of bands, not including your own music, which you can seamlessly integrate into the mix. It's massive in scope, especially considering that at its heart this is a game about a guy with a plank and some powder.  Amped's contribution to the extreme genre is fame -- your goal is to build your way up from a nobody to a superstar, getting new stats for your characters, getting new clothing sponsors, and beating the pros until the entire world knows about your reputation. You'll play on four real mountains and one manufactured one, unlocking different sections of them as you progress, and gaining access to a variety of runs. As you begin you'll be dealing with miniature runs, but as you progress you'll have massive runs that run through the entire mountain, criss-crossing familiar areas and giving you access to completely new ones. You've got multiple goals for every section, and new goals unlock as you progress, like competing with a pro, or fulfilling a sponsor's specific trick requirements. Most of all, Amped is just about exploring the largest mountains ever represented in a game, so enormous that you'll find yourself finding new sections even after hours and hours of play.  Gameplay  There are two factors that are going to have you rethinking Amped's fun -- the learning curve, and the short, short levels. When you start, you'll find yourself on runs that are literally under a minute, giving you barely enough time to get yourself up to speed, let alone pulling off major tricks. To make matters worse, the controls are a bit different that what you're used to. While they're similar to Tricky, there are elements of Tony Hawk involved, not to mention some new aspects that will literally make you feel like you've actually discovered bugs in the game. But stick with it.  The Controls are actually pretty simple, at least on paper. Tweak tricks with triggers, grind with one button, and the other three buttons, as well as the right stick, are used for grabs when you're in the air. Not bad, right? Well like Tricky, you'll have to really be aware of how you're faced -- this isn't like Tony Hawk, where characters will start to situation themselves correctly. The cool animation of the game has the snowboarder twisting his torso separate to his legs, but when it comes to judge how much you need to ~oversteer~ to land correctly, it's hard to judge from just a simple jerk of the pad. The same goes for vertical steering as well, which is made worse when you're allowed to spin in odd directions -- but you're totally unable to figure out the Rubik's puzzle of how to upright yourself before you hit the snow again. Where this really gets complicated is when you start using the ~spring loaded~ spins of the game. Hold down the jump button and a direction, and if you release them correctly, you'll get an insane snap that will allow you to perform a quick flip or turn, and add momentum to your overall spin. If you're used to playing Tricky this will usually translate into having your character crash constantly at first... if you're used to Tony Hawk, you'll wonder why you can barely get your character to spin. It's actually a cool trick that look authentic (uh, to people like me who can't afford snowboarding, anyway), but you'll swear that this is the dumbest gameplay on earth... at least for your first 20 minutes of play. Even after you've become a pro, you'll find yourself groaning when your character does a spin turn -- or doesn't -- when you need them to, but overall it works.  Because the levels are so incredibly organic, sometimes the ability to spin in any direction, and do snap turns can work against itself, especially when you wish the characters would ~lock~ onto ramps and half pipes a little more like Tony Hawk, or when you wish the camera would get a little more aggressive when you hit jumps that are at weird angles. It makes pulling off tricks harder than it should be at times... but since you're not on a time limit, it all seems so wrong karmically to get too frustrated when you have the odd fall. Especially considering that the game's made big improvements on the matter from the earlier builds we played a few months back.  What is unforgivable, however, is the constant pole teasing going on in the game. You'll see poles everywhere to grind on... but for whatever odd reason, the designers have opted to make them so high up that you can only access them if you hit them at the start -- or even worse, off of a jump. What this means is that you'll constantly get to poles that you can't grind on, or one's that you've just missed. Why was this decision made, especially when there are scattered non-teasing poles on the levels as well? I guess we'll never know.  Mode Heaven You've got a good selection of modes in the game to keep you happy, from hitting both Pro and Media scores in the game, to doing a sponsor run where you have to do tricks based on a sponsor's interest, and Pro matches. You can actually kill two birds with one stone by beating the Pro score goals by doing tricks, while going for the jumps, ramps, and rails that have the Media icon floating above them, which are how you score media points. Of course, if you don't like ridicule (and believe me, you'll get it), then you might want to stay away from the photographers until your ego's a little tougher. The Pro mode has you following a Pro boarder, and topping their tricks on the specific jumps they hit... it's fast, but fun. The sponsor matches actually provide you with some of the biggest challenges in the game, because you'll have to do specific tricks on a run to make a sponsor proud, like rails or spins and flips. Do a sloppy flip, and their excitement goes down -- do an amazing trick that they don't care about, and you'll get little reaction from your Amped meter. So not only do you have to hit their tricks, but you've got to keep doing it throughout a run to keep their enthusiasm up. Devious stuff... you'll love it. You can even save your replay, and actually compete against it later in a special Pro mode -- it's an awesome addition that will most likely be missed by many gamers.  Because there's no time limit, all of this is pretty low stress. If you don't beat the scores, then go back and do it again. The problem with this is that since you're not locked under a time limit, you can exploit scores pretty easy, like hitting a rail slow, and jumping and hitting the rail again and again... for the first half of the game, at least, you'll be able to hit totals by doing two rails, maybe three. If Amped's got a fatal flaw, it's that it's a little too friendly. While there's challenge, it's always handled in such a mellow way that sometimes you'll wish that there was something a little more pressing in your snowboarding world.  Graphics  Gulp. Wait until you hit Altibahn, when you can literally see down the entire face of a giant mountain. No tricks are needed to keep the draw distance tight -- this game shows you everything. You'll see tiny snowboarders ahead of you in the distance, powder coming off their boards as they hit a good jump. You'll board through thin fog, through clear days, and through snowy afternoons, all represented with stunning realtime lighting. You'll sink into deeper powder, you'll grate over shiny, specular mapped ice, and you'll create trails in the packed snow. Where the game truly shows of the Xbox hardware is in the sheer size of it all, though. You'll be stunned at how large the levels are, and how open and free they are to your eyes. If you see it, you can go there. While the design isn't as dense or insane as most snowboarding games, particularly since the levels are based on real mountains, visually it's made up for in prime real estate.  The riders are filled with tiny details, and you'll notice them intimately since you can pretty much dress them down to their underwear. You can pick from 45 snowboards, a myriad of boots, binding, coats, pants, hats and even goggles, all of which are noticeable on the final character model. It's a disgusting amount of customization, and totally over the top, so of course you'll love it.  The levels and models are stunning, but care has been taken with nearly every element of the game, from the rotating ice menu system to the weird, Monty Python cut n' paste animations for when you reach specific goals in the game, like getting the cover of the local gazette. The presentation is polished and likeable, and you'll have as much fun navigating the system as you will trying to pull a double flip on Brighton.  Sound It's hard to complain about music when you've got 150 songs to choose from -- that's why I'm not going to. Of course there are some bad songs, or even bad genres depending on your tastes, but you can always skip songs with a simple button press at any time, and you can actually take genres of music out of your permanent playlist in the menu system. You can also use your own music in the game and add your playlists to the game's, mixing in your music with the Amped pack-in set. You'll play for hours without repeating tracks... which is heaven in a game this large.  Sound effects are nothing less than spectacular, particularly the heavenly sound of the board cutting through ice, or grinding on rails. Photographers are annoying, but never because of their voices -- usually because you don't need to be reminded that you landed on your head trying to get a perfect photo. The music is definitely the focus of the game, so the sound effects are isolated and identifiable... but always, always pleasurable. Even the menu system noises are fantastic, and filled with nice clicks and chatters.   Multiplayer There's no real multiplayer per se in the game, but you can play a horse type game, where you take turns competing for highest score. If there's fun to be had with your friends, it's to be had in a DIY way, like recording your replays and trying to have your friends beat you. Amped  is a Valium-fueled take on snowboarding, but the time-limit free missions to the open, looser runs. You're free to do what you want, when you feel like it, and while you're under stress in the middle of a mission, the overall experience is oddly relaxing, especially early in the game when there's no real pressure to beat every goal in order to unlock new levels. Just as in games like Tony Hawk, the only frustration comes in the repeating levels to get a specific medal -- but even then, you can always restart in a flash. Match that with the open air feel of the levels, the breathtaking coolness of sliding through powder, and the breezy sound effects and in-game chatter, and you've got yourself the gaming equivalent of sitting in the hot tub after a long day on the slopes. Amped is a new way to look at snowboarding, and it's fun and large enough to keep you interested for hours and hours. Sure, there are some problems with the way the game controls, but the overall package is well designed, and most of all, totally charming. Amped manages to be simultaneously epic and down-home at the same time, thanks to the mixture of cool presentation, easy to navigate goal structure, and time-free boarding on giant mountains. You won't sweat while playing a game of Amped... but then again, we're talking about snow, aren't we? Enjoy the powder.", "date": "Nov 22, 2001"}
