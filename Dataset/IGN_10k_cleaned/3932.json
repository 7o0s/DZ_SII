{"name": "Jumping Flash! 2", "name_review": "Jumping Flash 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/25/jumping-flash-2", "text": "The first Jumping Flash! was one of those rare games that grab you from out of nowhere and shake you from your mediocre game-induced stupor until you're smiling and jumping around like an idiot. Jumping Flash! 2 also has that ability, but, while it's undoubtedly great, it never shakes you up as hard as the first. Maybe it's because everybody's already seen the first, and 2 doesn't really make enough dramatic changes to warrant unbridled excitement.  Which isn't to say it's not good. In fact it's great. It's just more of the same. Robbit's back, only this time you have to rescue these weird, white tripod guys called MuuMuus, instead of jetpods. The worlds are as funky and cool as ever, only bigger. Here bigger does mean better. There's also some hidden bonus worlds, a staple of the platform game conspicuously missing from the first.  One thing that could have used some improvement is the surprisingly low level of difficulty. The worlds and bosses (though impressive) are just too easy. However, this shouldn't take away too much from the sheer enjoyment to be had piloting Robbit around. If you liked the original, you'll definitely like this one.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
