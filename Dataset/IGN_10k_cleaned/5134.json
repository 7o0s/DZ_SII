{"name": "The Saga of Ryzom", "name_review": "Saga of Ryzom Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/19/saga-of-ryzom-review", "text": "It's getting pretty hot in here for massively multiplayer online games, with the encroaching twin releases of EverQuest II and World of Warcraft, in addition to Jump to Lightspeed, EverQuest: Omens of War, DAOC: Catacombs, and a host of lower-profile endeavors. Thankfully, a few projects have fallen by the wayside, so people like me have room to breathe and check out games like The Saga of Ryzom.   Let me say off the bat that Ryzom is a pretty game. I've heard otherwise, and I can only assume that these people aren't maxing out their settings, because it's pretty easy on the eyes with a Radeon 9800 Pro. Lots of polygons, particularly with the character models, weather effects including snow and rain, shiny spell and water effects, lots of foliage and beasties--in fact, Ryzom is one of the most heavily populated games I can remember. Unfortunately, while having so many creatures and non-combat characters running breathes life into the game, it does seem to play havoc with even the fastest Internet connection. Load times are also longer than what I'm used to elsewhere, but thankfully you'll only have to deal with that when launching the game, and a little bit when your character dies.   Ryzom is set in the far future, with multiple playable factions competing and cooperating for territory, against each other and against the indigenous creatures of Atys. Instead of being necessarily class-based, you have several categories your skill points go to, fueled by some basic abilities. Kill with a melee weapon and you gain Combat points you can use to upgrade skills and buy new types of skills. Kill with magic and you get magic points. Gathering materials from the land and using those materials to make items also have their own skill development trees. Interestingly, you can eventually max out all of your skills, up to level 250. However, there are certain skills you buy using whatever specific skill points you have available. For example, you've killed 50 Mektoubs and have 100 combat points for doing things like increasing hitpoints, health regeneration, dexterity, and so forth. You've also used a combat spell and have gained 100 magic points. With those 200 points, you can buy crafting skills, which are broken down into armor, jewelry, weapons, and so forth. Once you've purchased a crafting category with these points, you can purchase recipes for specific items.     Unfortunately, there is no item looting in Ryzom. All you will collect from a conquered beast is crafting materials or mission materials. You'll be tasked with collecting X number of fur tufts from a Mektoub or another creature, and it will drop a random number of those, or none at all. The items appear as icons, and the mission items have a purple background while craft items are blue. Since you can't sell or trade mission items, it doesn't make much sense for them to show up when you don't have a mission for them, especially since the mission items you collect don't count until you've actually gotten the mission. You can sell materials to your heart's content, however.   Speaking of missions, those don't gain you experience points or items, just money. The actual quests that would do that aren't scheduled to be implemented until the middle of next month. While this doesn't hobble gameplay, it does mean that the pacing is a lot slower than what was probably originally intended, and the variety is a lot narrower. There's also no background music, also scheduled for mid-November. Combined with the occasionally sketchy network latency and a few other things, like incomplete character animations and a pretty rough user interface, one gets the impression of playing a slightly unfinished game. Some of the missions appear to be broken, with mission items you're picking up not counting towards the total you have to collect.    During my play time, I had this problem with the Mektoubs. In this area, there are also the Izam, a floating vegetarian beast; Yubos, which look kind of like guinea pigs; the Ragu, vicious canines; and the Kipees. The Kipees have lots of armor and take a long time to kill. If another gangs up on you, that could be it. The Izams don't have any missions specific to them. Since the Mektoub missions appear to be broken, this kind of limits your choices. The NPCs wandering the zone have all variety of missions, including ones to craft items for them, gather materials from the land, and so forth. If you just want to kill stuff, you're going to get bored, so the enforced variety means you'll have to take a little longer developing your combat skills while you beef up other areas. This means you'll be spending a lot of time in one zone. This is where having proper quests would speed up progression and keep things fresh.    You can set UI transparency, but there's two sliders each for the background and foreground of the window, which is a little confusing. You can change one window to a set of icons, but you can't get rid of it altogether. You can increase the resolution and partially resize or close some windows, but upping the res can also make the game run a little sluggish. Your character page also doesn't list your armor or damage rating. This is partly because those two items give and take several different types of damage, but it would be nice to have some kind of overall number attached to it that you could reference at a glance. Another problem with the UI is the amount of info. How much faster is my health regeneration for each point I put into it? Is this gathering skill something I need two people to use? How much more accurate does this other skill make my weapon?   Speaking of accuracy, there is a lot of dodging in this game. Maybe it's because there's some gameplay factor I never quite figured out (a problem exacerbated by a disappointingly slim manual, a slimmer in-game help system, and consistently low player population), but it seemed like the enemy was dodging nearly 50% of the time--no matter what difficulty it was, no matter what type of monster it was, and no matter what skill I was boosting my attack with. It's a bit frustrating and time-consuming. Battle is also complicated by the fact that you can't quite gauge an enemy's difficulty. Each mob gets two combat colors associated with it, and there's apparently a very large gradient attached to that. The Scowling Ragu will be a challenging fight, but the Baying Ragu hanging out a stone's throw away, and who looks identical save for the name floating above his head, will tear you to itty bits in short order.   To top it off, enemies will chase you until either they die or until their pathfinding AI makes just enough mistakes for you to stay outside of their attack range until you've run all the way to a town, where the NPC guards will make quick work of them. There's little room for error, and the human mobs have a habit of coming out of the woodwork to defend their group members. Well, it turns out that the human NPC missions are broken as well. In order to satisfy a mission telling you to kill ~one~ of them, you actually have to eliminate the whole group. Because of the swarming issue, this is next to impossible, and you're left with pulling tufts off of Yubos and skull fragments from Izams. Assuming you pick the right Izam. That Vulgar Izam is all right, but the Prime Izam next to him is not only a deal-breaker but might also join in the fun if he sees you attacking his buddies.    Throughout my play time, I could never shake the impression that The Saga of Ryzom needed a little more time in the oven, not only to finish up some UI and content issues, but to get the word out, because the game world, at least the American servers, were pretty empty. Maybe it's busy over in Europe, but their schedule is virtually the opposite of the one in the States, so it's a moot point. From the patch notes, you can tell the game is updated pretty often--at least once a week--which is a good thing, because they're paying attention to issues and addressing them--but it's also a bad thing because there's a lot of little glitches and constant network hiccups, especially in the cities, which are chock-full of non-interactive NPCs. The game has an awesome art style to it, and there's lots of character to the beasts--they'll run up to you and sniff around, sit around and scratch itchy places, forage, scamper, take naps, etc.--but the scope feels too ambitious for a developer with only Ryzom on its resume. (You may recall that Dark Age of Camelot had seemed to have come out of nowhere, but Mythic had actually done over a dozen online games before that, albeit on a smaller scale.) I think The Saga of Ryzom has the potential to turn into a real contender, but not until they smooth out player introduction, get some more players on board (a Catch 22, granted), take care of  network lag, and introduce quests to make gameplay more rewarding and better paced overall.", "date": "Oct 19, 2004"}
