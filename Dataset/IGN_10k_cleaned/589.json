One of these orphans, Colt's Wild West Shootout, actually intrigued me quite a bit. Using my executive privilege, I grabbed this one of the top of the stack and got ready to experience, ~fast arcade action so real you'll swear you're in the old wild west,~ a phrase prominently displayed on the back of the game's box. As you may have gathered by now, I was somewhat disappointed.  So what exactly is Colt's Wild West Shootout? It's a basic rail based shooting game on the lines of that 80's arcade classic Hogan's Alley (yeah, I know you didn't move around in that game, but trust me, this game is pretty similar) or Lethal Enforcers (which appeared sometime later). In each of the game's four different levels, you move along a preset path, stopping at various intervals to shoot it out with villains who pop up from behind conveniently placed cover. You start the game with three health points, represented by gold sheriff's badges at the bottom of your screen. If you get hit or you hit an innocent bystander, you lose a star. Lose all your stars and the game's over.  Sound simple? It is, especially when you consider that the game is mouse or joystick driven. Without adding even the tiny bit of skill that using a light gun would require, Colt's Wild West Shootout passed up its only opportunity to stand out from the crowd. The only real skills necessary are being able to recognize targets quickly, counting how many bullets you have left and reloading when you're empty. Since you have a big target floating around on the screen to tell you exactly where your bullets are going, aim isn't really a consideration at all. Since the same people pop up in the same places (although they don't always show up at the same times), once you've played a level a few times you'll be able to do pretty well. After my fifth or sixth time through the game, I finally figured out what it was that seemed so damn familiar about the title  it's the video game equivalent to Whack-A-Mole.   While they're certainly nothing to write home about, Colt's graphics and sound did what they were supposed to do fairly well. Visually the game is archaic (apparently people in the Old West were a good bit grainier than they are now), but the animation was smooth and the gameplay never slowed down. The sound effects (the gunshots and cries of pain) were also done pretty well, as was the voice acting, but the game's soundtrack, which consisted of old-timey tunes like, ~She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain,~ and ~Red River Valley,~ played on a bad piano in loops, almost drove me over the edge. Fortunately Steve freaked out first and asked me turn off my volume so he didn't have to kill me.  In the end, it's not old graphics or bad music that made me hate this game, it's the fact that it offers absolutely no long-term (or for even short-term) gameplay. I beat this game for the first time exactly ten minutes after I loaded it onto my system. Afterwards, I found the difficulty setting and the game to its highest level. This kept me busy for another ten minutes. At that point I had exhausted the game's options. No secret levels, no hidden bonuses, just put the game away and go buy another one. I find this totally unacceptable. While the game's $15 price tag may excuse a lot in the way of bad graphics and poor storyline, it doesn't excuse serving up a game that can be totally squeezed of all its entertainment value in half-an-hour. My advice is to leave this one alone and wait for a better designed shooting game that can actually go the distance.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jan 4, 2000"}
