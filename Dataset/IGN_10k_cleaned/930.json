This game could have been so much better than it actually turned out to be. My crew has been trying to hook me up into the joys of Grand Theft Auto for the last couple of years, but being the stubborn bastard that I am, I haven't really latched onto it yet. After pulling me aside a few times and pleading with me to give it a try, my friends couldn't stop pushing me to get behind the controller with the latest sequel and I was prepared to be amazed -- but then, almost magically, I wasn't.   Now I can see what the hoopla is about right from the beginning; the outrageous premise, the long list of weapons, and a warehouse full of different automobiles are certainly very enticing. Surely one of the most original action titles to hit a console since the 16-bit days, Grand Theft Auto 2 looks on the surface to be a bona fide joyride. But dig a bit deeper and you'll find disappointment.   The concept is quite simple: become a hired gun for any number of the city's organized crime families and carry out their orders no questions asked. Ranging from such easy tasks as assassinating a horde of Elvis impersonators to the more difficult duty of bringing down an entire SWAT team, the scope of missions are as broad as they are violent. Blasting innocent civilians and cops will continue to help you rack up the cashola, and if that's not enough, you can always stick to art of car-jacking and smash your hapless victim into the pavement for good measure. Surely, this isn't a game for parents who like to keep a close eye on the gore-level of their children's videogame content.   Get this intersection a traffic light. As heinous as it may sound to most of the normal people out there all this mayhem can actually turn out to be quite fun. Watching the screen as dozens of crazed citizens run for their life when you whip out that rocket launcher is more entertaining than you'd think. Even if violent games aren't usually your cup of tea, Grand Theft Auto 2's comic way of handling the bloody carnage should peak your interest, even if it's just for a moment.   Graphically, there's not much to pick apart here. Dark and atmospheric, the visuals are akin to something right out of an old cop movie from the 70's. Lighting effects up the wazoo and a large number of concrete textures (wait, is that a good thing?) do justice to a world full of crime and corruption. Unfortunately the framerate turns into a vat of extra thick molasses when too many characters are onscreen -- especially when there's gunfire. Although a much faster show when compared to its PlayStation counterpart, the overall speed of the game suffers for the sake of beauty. Ah, the price you pay for good looks.   Another big plus is the kickin' soundtrack. Emulating a radio broadcast and changing tracks depending on the vehicles you happen to have ~borrowed~ for the time being, every type of musical genre has been touched in some way. Rock, Industrial, Country -- you name it and it's probably in there. Hiding behind the wheel of a stretch limousine or latched onto a stolen garbage truck, you never know what you're going to hear next.   So if I dig the visuals, the sounds, and the basic idea of GTA2, where does the problem come in? In a word? Control. Hard to manage in the PC and PSX versions to begin with, the Dreamcast scheme is unforgivable. You're able to choose from among only four preset templates, and your movement can never be controlled by the digital pad. That is a true shame, as the analog movement proves to be too sensitive for its own good and sends you zooming forward in one direction at a pace that defies accuracy. Switch it around so that you control movement with a button and it's a little bit better, but awkward only begins to describe that setup. Even more disappointing is the fact that, assuming you find a scheme you like, you can't even save it to memory. You have to reset it every time you play again. What the hell?   Too many times did I try to simply ascend a set of stairs only to fall off because I touched the analog pad slightly in the wrong direction. Too many times was I killed from enemy fire when I tried to whirl myself around into the appropriate angle to try and shoot him before being blown away. Spotty and overeager, the misaligned gameplay takes a huge chunk out of what could be an otherwise enjoyable game.   Another problem spot lies in the mission structure. Vague and sporadic, figuring out what to do and when to do it is a lot harder than it should be. And though you'll get the hang of the loose, open-ended style of play after awhile, it'll still take you days to clear some of the more difficult stages. A giant ball of mid-life frustration is sure to tack itself onto your temples before reaching the end of this game. Good news for some, but for me... well, you get the idea.For the most part, Grand Theft Auto 2 gave a big effort and tried its bloody little heart out at being a premier title. But with the shoddy play mechanics and a sometimes overspent nonlinear approach at completing your tasks, DMA and Take 2 could have done better. Recommended as a rental at best, try before you buy this creative entry into a usually cookie-cutter clean action genre.", "date": "May 9, 2000"}
