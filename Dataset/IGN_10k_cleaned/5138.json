{"name": "Men of Valor", "name_review": "Men of Valor", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/19/men-of-valor-2", "text": "'Tis the season to be a Vietnam shooter, and Developer 2015, known for its work with Electronic Arts on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, is assuredly providing the best chance of re-creating the most authentic semblance of Vietnam in a videogame. Not surprisingly, Men of Valor, for both Xbox and PC, feels remarkably like Medal of Honor (not to mention sounding a little like it too), only instead of the historically noble and valiant days of World War II, we're in the psychedelic, ethically challenged days of Vietnam in the nation-torn 1960s.   Men of Valor is a solid game at its core, but it's very, very rough around the edges. Designed as a leafy corridor shooter, these green, foliage-filled hallways are at least wider and less obvious than in most games of this type. Team 2015 has created an impressive set of modes for online play via Xbox Live!, cooperative play, and System Link. The whole set up is fat with modes and a solid, single-player campaign. The final build, however, has roughly cobbled-together cutscenes, long load times, a chunky framerate, disturbing trends in its AI, and though there are glimmers of enjoyment, overall, it's more of a labor of love, than love itself. It's more trial and error than experiment and enjoy. It's more familiar than new. And it's certainly intense, but is it all that fun?   A Different Story?  Well, fun means something different to everyone. So, let's dig in. Developer 2015's game clearly takes pains to deliver an honest, authentic and historically accurate look at Vietnam War in videogame form. More than anything, you'll get the feeling that 2015 did its homework trying to re-create the war in a manner that's honest and fair. You'll be on missions where you'll have to save a reporter who then misrepresents the war in his film coverage. You'll see situations in which you or your team have to kill what appear to be simple farmworkers who just happen to be carrying weapons, bombs or grenades. You'll have your senses soundly rocked by sound effects, yelling, cursing, and screaming Vietnamese male and female soldiers, and you'll see squad members die in battle. There is no doubt that 2015 did its best to re-create the war in the most accurate way, and in that, it succeeded. And I might add, it's done a much better job than any of the other developers of Vietnam games this year.   Big Mac, Fries, and Coke, and hurry up! A few of the cutscenes do a great job of touching upon the insanity of the war. Some of the intro scenes do a good job of setting up missions, giving you the feeling that there is almost no way you're going to survive. But several things detract from the story. The character animation is clumsy and simplistic, and the dialog is bare-bones and dull, so while setting and music might create a scene, the look and feel of many scenes is ruined by a lack of polish, finesse, and the finer levels of production that the gaming world has become accustomed to.   The story is different from the norm, too. The lead character is Dean Shepard, an African-American soldier who's upright, compassionate and sensible. You'll get to know him to a certain degree though the set of letters he writes to his parents and his brother in between missions. It's not only respectable to feature an African-American as the lead character, it's rare and commendable. However, while the letters are an interesting idea, they aren't woven well into the game itself. You'll play through a mission and find little character development of Dean himself. There is talk and chatter among characters, but none that mold Dean's character or that reinforce the letters, which as a result become solitary, dull, and in the end, filler. There are individual story parts here, but there is no real beginning, middle, or end, and what's more, no real direction.     Gameplay  As a first-person shooter, Men of Valor is a game you'll feel very comfortable with, since it plays almost exactly like Medal of Honor. I've played all of the MOH games, and I'll tell you, despite my desire to like this, it provides little for the imagination. You'll walk from from point A to point B along a forested hallway and watch as enemies pop out and shoot at you. There are very few shortcuts, if any. There are minimal secondary paths, almost no power-ups, and little need to explore. Granted, there is nothing wrong with an historical-accurate FPS, but this simple formula grew rusty a few years back.   Men of Valor tries but ultimately doesn't waver too much from the Medal of Honor  recipe (though I prefer it over the lackluster Medal of Honor: Rising Sun). Developer 2015 sets up each mission with long load times, each accompanied by quotes form generals, presidents, and Vietnamese leaders, and often by archival black-and-white footage of the war itself. At some points, it's a little like watching the History Channel -- educational, but sleep-inducing. You'll then find yourself in a huge single-player campaign that supports a very solid range of mission types, many of them changing with scripted objective updates midway through missions. In this way, VU's team does try and widen the format of formulaic shooting. You'll fight in fox holes, creep through tunnels, charge hills and enemy embankments, call in air support, snipe, and find yourself in pretty big, open-field skirmishes.   The fighting itself is intense, visceral, and chaotic. When you're not caught in ambushes or fully surrounded in intense open-field battles, you'll sneak through silent jungles fully aware of an impending ambush. And you will feel your pulse flare and your adrenaline rush. But unfortunately, these likeable sensations are never captured and run with to create any real emotion in the story, and the gameplay is never fully explored through diverse enough gameplay. So, instead of feeling thrilled to play another level, you'll feel stressed, perhaps even taxed. Not necessarily the desired result. The single-player campaign is not short -- it probably clocks in at 15-plus or so hours, depending on your skill level -- but you'll really start wonder when it will all end.    Bridge over troubled water. Perhaps the biggest problem, besides been-there-done-that level design and the lack of exploration is the AI on both sides. Your teammates take an amazing amount of abuse, though it's not because they're tough. It's because they throw themselves at the enemy, rarely killing them, and more often then not, they turn their back on the assault. They often run in front of you while you're shooting, and they may very well take the best tree to hide behind while pushing forward. On the other side, the enemy AI is just short of clueless. You'll watch an enemy walk in front of you, maybe two to three feet, looking for its place to set up. It won't shoot while running. Sometimes, it takes three, maybe five seconds for them to react to your presence, and then they'll start shooting. Other times, they don't react at all to you or your team AI. You'll often see your AI and the enemy AI standing pretty close to one another and not firing on each other at all. Or missing for 100 shots at a time. Your own team AI doesn't die, either. I suppose if they AI was perfect, I'd never live to finish a single mission, but this AI is spotty, inconsistent, and troublesome.   The Unreal engine is used to create fully detailed environments with an enormous amount of polygons, cover points and obstacles. The good part of this is that the grass is so thick in parts, you can literally crawl through it unseen. Better than any Vietnam game yet, the jungles in Men of Valor are genuinely dense and designed for great ambushes, hiding, creeping, and sniping. The downside is that the game just doesn't flow all that well or move at a very consistent framerate. The game chunks out a lot, and accompanying the sluggish framerate is a frustrating, less-than-smooth control scheme. Neither aiming in general nor pinpointing enemies with precision is a smooth affair.    There is a good assortment of 1960s weapons. You'll use a basic knife, SKS with bayonet, M-1911, M-14, M-16, M-60, Ak-47, PPSH41, M-79 grenade launcher, and hand grenades to name a few. You'll have the chance to use set turrets on ground, and mounted machine guns in moving helicopters. You'll also get to do a river run using the hella-fun M-79 grenade launcher.     Multiplayer  The multiplayer modes are hefty, though all of the mechanical, control, and AI issues carry over into these modes of play. You can play a two-player split-screen duel (though not a four-player one), a two-player split-screen cooperative game, or you can connect up to 12 Xboxes for System Link play. Via Xbox Live, up to 12 people can vie in a single online match, of which there are five types. You can engage in a Multiplayer Mission (specific battles based on historical events), Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Recover the Documents (like capture the flag), and Search and Destroy.    Overall, the amount of variety and the interestingly designed levels, including enormously detailed, dense and heavily forested levels, provide a perfect battleground for serious online matches. I played several games online to get a feel for the game, and though the control mechanics are not to die for, crouching and even lying down in totally blanketed areas does create an interesting and fun dynamic. At one point during online play, my opponent and I crawled toward each other on our stomaches and only when we were three feet away from one another did we see the other and shoot. The System Link option is inviting, and the cooperative campaign is solid and entertaining too. Even though the technical aspects of men of Valor aren't that impressive, the sheer amount of game possibilities and some very good online maps make up for it.    Graphics  While the levels are well covered in every imaginable shade of green and they're extremely well decorated and designed from a level of sheer density, the poor game character animations, motion-capture work, and the overall framerate detract from its general beauty.  Needless to say, the texture work is solid stuff; and even the water realistically flows in relaxing wave patterns. There is no pop-in, either. The characters themselves display a robust amount of polygons and the weapons look realistic, load accurately, and recoil with accuracy and a good feel. It's just too bad the animations are so repetitive and near comical.   1960s protoype laser for the Deathstar. Still, the special effects are solid. You'll experience a huge amount of explosions, gunfire, smoke and fire, and moving characters on screen simultaneously, and for the most part all of these effects individually look good. This is easily the best looking Vietnam game around, even if it's not the best looking FPS around. The game supports widescreen HDTV 480p.    Sound  Developer 2015 has done excellent audio work on Men of Valor. It's bought the audio chaos of Vietnam to its game and there is very little doubt that this aspect, while often gnawing on your senses in the most intense levels in an annoying way, digs right into your skull and bones in an effective way. In each level you'll hear you squad members cheering in Chaucerian tongues (i.e. with foul language), saying rude, rough, and harsh things to the enemy, and you'll no doubt hear the enemy, in its own poor English tongue, lashing out hatred toward American GIs. And it's not like there is a little of it, there's a lot.   Men of Valor supports Dolby Digital 5.1, so when you hear booming explosions in the background, a full string orchestra rising up during the middle of a level, and all of sudden, a string of curses thrown from both sides at one another as they shoot and kill one another, it sounds excellent.   It's just an amazingly intense audio sensation that seems to capture the feeling of the war as well as or better than comparable war games. (Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and Call of Duty also do amazing things with sound.) The music includes classic songs from the Mamas and the Papas, James Brown, and other well-known bands of the era.In all, Men of Valor is a mixed bag. It's an amazingly intense and visceral experience, but it's also a game that, for the most part, you've played many times before. The Vietnam era provides a different visual setting, and 2015 offers great audio work and sound effects, as well as a healthy set of mission types, so you will find this to be a solid FPS experience. The visual chaos and audio intensity rarely let up on you, and in that, 2015 succeeds well in re-creating a small part of Vietnam. But unfortunately, the level design is a letdown, and along with several production and technical mishaps -- weird cutscene jumps, sticky collision detection, chunky framerate and uneven control -- if you've played a few World War II shooters before, there is simpoly not enough here to warrant an instant purchase. I respect 2015's efforts at going for authenticity; the team doesn't let players down that way. I also respect its choice to have an African-American lead character. The only thing is the story never comes together, the letter writing never clicks with the game itself, and there is little character development or direction. If you can forgive the game's rough controls and framerate you might just want to check it out, because there are a ton of online gaming opportunities here, with five modes of play, character classes, and both System Link and Xbox Live play. You can also play through cooperatively offline, which is always a plus.", "date": "Oct 19, 2004"}
