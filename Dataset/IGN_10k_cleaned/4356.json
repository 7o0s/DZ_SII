Before Madden, Tecmo's little footballer was the sports game to beat on consoles, offering up Super Bowl-size fun, despite its fairly rudimentary graphics (it was the NES, after all) and a controller that only featured two buttons.  Tecmo, now a company known for the jiggly Dead or Alive ladies and the much-hyped Ninja Gaiden Xbox release, has entered the wireless space, opening Tecmo Mobile. The first release for this go-go gaming division is a mighty fine nod to their heritage: Tecmo Bowl.  Features:  Run-and-gun play Sixteen teams Offensive and defensive play  Before Tecmo Bowl's mobile debut, Sorrent's FOX Sports Football series was the undisputed gridiron champion. With its solid, if unspectacular graphics, and simple, fun gameplay, Sorrent quickly took the field and owned it. Football may be a game of inches, but with one 'Hail Mary' pass, Tecmo took it back.  Now, if you have no interest is reading the copious amounts of praise we're about to heap on Tecmo Bowl, hit yer 'back' button now, because this slick, old-school redux is deserving of almost every huzzah it receives. Tecmo Bowl captures all of the thrill and fun that millions of gamers enjoyed back on the NES. And while many may dismiss it as ~just a port,~ understand that porting a NES game to a cellphone is no easy feat.  Now, it must be said that Tecmo Bowl does not feature a full NFL license. The game only features sixteen NFC teams, and it only lists them by city, such as Seattle - not Seattle Seahawks. Also, there are no player names. But just because Tecmo couldn't add these purist, stat-head features, doesn't mean they didn't carefully watch how specific teams behave on the field and program Seattle to actually play like the real Seahawks. Which is, of course, terribly.  Tecmo Bowl is a quick game. There is very little lag, unless you create it yourself. Between plays, you are whisked to a playbook screen that allows you to select passing and running plays, and when you're on defense, how you want to stop the ball cold. At the bottom of the playbook screen is a small representation of the field, showing what yardline you're on.   In order to beat the computer, you must have a solid grip on offensive and defensive strategies. The computer will draw you little quarter, which is no good for the first few games, as you're too amazed to be playing a real offense/defense game on your cellphone to concentrate on advancing the ball. Tecmo Bowl is quite an achievement over current cellphone pigskinners, in that it finally offers a very full football experience. All that's missing, other than the other teams, is the Gatorade dump and a Super Bowl ring.  Tecmo Bowl looks startlingly close to its NES heritage. Big deal, you say. Go get Aspyr's Activision Anthology for the GBA, play H.E.R.O. (or, at least, attempt to), and then come back. See how difficult it can be to port an old game and get all of the nuances right? That's part of Tecmo Bowl's great success, is that they were able to squeeze the NES quality graphics out of the limited tech of a handset, in addition to throwing in audio and AI. Especially groovy are the animations that go along with punts and field goals.  Like Gameloft does with it's titles, Tecmo has been trying to optimize Tecmo Bowl for different handsets. For example, on an mMode-enabled Nokia 3650, you're going to get some bright, crisp visuals. However, on the BREW-enabled Motorla T720, you're going to hear more sounds.  Sorrent has enjoyed a good run in the sports arena, easily scoring touchdowns and victory laps with little competent competition. Until now. Throwing up the ol' stiff arm before Sorrent rushes the end zone again, Tecmo Bowl is an excellent, real-deal footballer that does more than rekindle fond NES memories -- it advances the ball and shows that mobile games can be a decidedly more complicated affair than number keys and so-so graphics. An excelent opening salvo from Tecmo Mobile. I can't wait to see what they release next.", "date": "Dec 24, 2003"}
