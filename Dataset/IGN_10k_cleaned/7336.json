{"name": "Mercury 2: Mercury Meltdown", "name_review": "Mercury Meltdown", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/10/mercury-meltdown", "text": "The first Mercury was a nice showcase for the PlayStation Portable, giving us a handheld puzzler that was most unlike anything else we'd played before on handhelds. It was powered by technology that couldn't really be done without the power of a console-quality system but with that addictive pick-up-and-play feel that you'd usually want to have with you rather than just stuck on your TV. One look at it and you knew you had to get your hands in this blob. But while the concept was great, the final game just wasn't as fleshed out and fun as it looked. It was unforgiving and limited, garnering fans for those who could handle the challenge but leaving everybody else with little to do with their shiny little blobs.  Ignition has poured out this sequel with the aim of addressing every issue of the first game, and it's a success on most every level. The level structure is changed and improved, the challenge level is more even-handed, the multiplayer is more thoroughly designed, the bonuses you unlock are well worth the effort ... it's a better, blobbier game to enjoy. There's not necessarily anything hugely different in Mercury Meltdown, but if you threw down your PSP in frustration last time, you can be sure that you're system will be safe from being smashed this time, and if you dug the first game but are worried about it feeling tired a second time, there are plenty of new ways to play and bonuses to earn to bring you back for more.    What makes Mercury Meltdown so much more enjoyable is the change in how it presents the levels. Last time, only a handful of levels were unlocked at a time, and for each one, you had to pass on a variety of levels to get through. You had to beat the clock, you had save your leaky Mercury, and you had to trigger the gates by solving the puzzle -- sometimes, you had to watch out for all three worries at the same time just to see more of the game. This time, a full 16 stages are presented at a time for you to work through each time you unlock a Lab of levels, and progress on each stage builds into your total progress. Every drip of Mercury saved from the abyss in this puzzler goes towards opening up the next level, while each Bonus Star collected on a finished level will get you one step closer to unlocking the Party games.   Sure, you will eventually have to put together a neat-perfect run (if you have the skills) to earn the true high score and unlock all the game's goodies, but you don't have to try so hard your first time through. The game still plays on once the evil clock runs out, and unless you lose every drop of your Mercury, you can usually play through to the end of a stage. Maybe you won't make much game progress by finishing a stage with only 5% of your Mercury left, but the feeling of satisfaction is still a gigantic reward when the game gets really tough. And once you complete a stage, you're pumped up to go back in and do it better until you've got that Golden Cork on your level's completion vial. Yes, this change makes the game seem easier overall than last time, but it's impossible to find fault with this improvement -- later levels are still tricky as hell (not to mention that there's well over twice as many of them), and switching to a performance-based leveling system allows pros to barrel through early stages and skip up to the tough tasks much faster.       The other big improvement is the addition of the new Party games, a collection of unlockable minigames giving you more ways to play with your goo. The variety here ranges nicely from play similar to the main Mercury game (a wacky little ride called Rodeo where you try to keep your blob on a small platform while a gusting fan tries to blow you off) to a completely unique straight-puzzle game called Metrix (a clever block-dropping game that feels unlike almost any other puzzler since you are in control of making the block shapes as you fill 3-by-3 trays with goo as fast and as cleverly as you can to fit somewhere on the game grid.) Party gaming is a nice diversion, and there's progress to accomplish here as well as you work through each level on all the games to try to unlock further play stages. The bonuses aren't all completely filling, however. The Race game, while clever in concept (it really does feel like you would imagine a racing game with a big blob would feel, rather than just some blobs-on-wheels kart racer), never provides enough visual or track variation, seeming like the same generic stage even as it ramps up in difficulty. And the Shove game should have brilliant -- it's Curling, but with blobs! -- but you don't accrue blobs by knocking other players or your own blobs, and the Friction control used to give your blob a little more or less motion as it slides towards the goal is confusing without any visual of your work -- if you weren't paying close attention to the quick blip explaining the controls in the loading screen, you might not even know that those buttons are there.    Multiplayer is improved over the first game and is now perhaps worth your time -- it's not Mercury Meltdown's best feature, but it can be a fun way to play. Again, the ad-hoc multiplayer mode is just a Ghost Mode battle between the two players on the same unlocked stages (and again, it's just two at a time), but the Battle Pick-Ups can change things in a hurry. Some are simple -- the Lightning Bolt will kill off a percentage of your opponent's Mercury, the Switcher will swap your blob with his (useful if he's far ahead), and the Reverse Controls pick-up is as devious as it sounds. Other pick-ups are quite crafty, such as the Melter that dissolves the opponent's Mercury state into a mess of little Mercuries, and Magnet that pulls others towards the walls of stage and drags them down. We're hoping that some of the Downloadable Levels planned for the game are more focused on multiplayer, however, because very few of the standard stages offer the kind of freedom of play and randomness that good multiplayer needs -- since you're ghosts on each other's screen, only the early stages are fun to toy with the Pick-Ups before stages become just too narrow and unforgiving for either player to mess around. (Most often, you'll forget the other guy is there until he grabs a Pick-Up that makes it almost impossible not to kill yourself.) Multiplayer in the Party Games is almost always fun, however, and there are a variety of Pick-Ups in each minigame that makes it feel different from playing Singles as well as adding challenge and surprise of playing with others.   As a sequel, Mercury Meltdown changes up enough elements to feel different and new again, with technical adjustments and a host of play additions. At first glance, the cartoonish overhaul seems like it would be a big adjustment (especially the black ~cel-shading~ outline on the blob, which can be turned off), but getting away from the cold steel colors of the original brightens up the game and makes it more fun. Ignition has added some shine effects to crooked surfaces to make it much easier to read grades, and the addition of earnable ~Skins~ for your Mercury blob give it some needed variety (some are very cool and surprising, and even the black-outlined blob is good in that it helps define the blob's shape easier to see dissipating on narrow ledges; the pure blob form, however, doesn't seem as reflective as last time.) The soundtrack is also brightened up, for better or worse, depending on how much you liked techno last time and how easily you can ignore the carnival-style beats in Meltdown.   Of course, there are new features to mix things up. Many make the most of the fluidity of the game's star blob, with clever solid and heated versions of the Mercury that change the way you play by varying your liquidity. There are also new enemies to face, although overall, there are less toothy monsters sucking up your Mercury in favor of more brain-twisting creatures and mechanisms that you have to figure out how to make work for you -- the stinky version of Stan called the LubeCube is just an odd concept, and a real pain in the neck if you want to move fast but don't want to lose globs due to his toxic trail. Some clever new vertical challenges are also thrown in to constantly keep you on your toes. Overall, there's a lot more variety to the stages, and a lot less frustration -- too many stages in the last game were simply high-wire acts on narrow beams with a big glob of Mercury rounding impossible angles; Meltdown more often tests how big your brain is rather than how twitchy your fingers are.     Ignition has made careful effort to use the PSP better this time. The new default camera set-up puts more of the most useful control directly at your fingertips -- better auto-camera design is still begged for, however, as the viewpoint still can't follow you as well as it needs to when levels begin to get crazy and twist up on each other (making some walls clear to the camera could have made a world of different on a few stages). A new Free-Look feature is added where you can press Select to pause the game and scroll across the game world on your own, getting a much better picture of the challenges ahead than the normal stage fly-by. Nothing's changed about the feel of the analog nub, which is fine for the game as it is (even though a few games make players that nub, the PSP's controller is up to the task of maneuvering through some very tight spots) but it still feels like you can can't tilt the level up as much as you want before it stops, and it might have been nice to loosen that up and let players flip their goo wild on some stages. (Also, the Tilt Control add-on feature that developers kicked around early with the first game is sadly nowhere to be found again.) Loadtimes have significantly improved, making this a much better on-the-go game to keep in your collection. Game Sharing is included, although it's disappointingly only a 8-level demo and not does not include multiplayer. More useful is a handy Tutorial mode and a fun little Playground testing area to get newbies used to all the gameplay features. We also appreciate the new Downloadable Levels feature (even if it's not supported the way it should be -- the only way to get new levels is to download them from your PC or maybe the PSP browser since Infrastructure Mode isn't supported) and hope that sees a good amount of new content added.  A good deal of gamers never saw more than maybe half of the first Mercury because of the challenge level, and the same will probably be true of this sequel -- the difference here is that the first half is still a big portion of gaming to suck down, and the satisfaction you get from playing and earning whatever you can is so much greater. The design of the puzzles in Mercury Meltdown puts more emphasis on your being a blob, keeping the challenge level for those prepared for it but evening out the game for the rest of those who just love the concept and the gameplay. I can remember playing through about a third of the way through before coming across one of those narrow beams so often faced in the first game -- the ones that are just barely thick enough to hold your blob, both sides of your Mercury hanging over the edge and just barely holding on because of surface tension. I thought, ~OK, here we go ... nothing but these damned ledges from here on out.~ And then, I realized the goal of the stage -- I wasn't supposed to be out on impossible ledges with my whole big blob; instead, I was supposed to divide that blob on a spike, go towards those ledges with a much more manageable half-blob, and then (and here's the tricky part), somehow maneuver two blobs around using walls and corners to stop one or the other so that I could reach color changers and get them back together as the right paint mix for the final gate. It was a revelation, both for facing the stage and for the game as a whole. Yes, this game was frustrating, but frustrating in the right places and for the right reasons. Mercury Meltdown is more encouraging and enjoyable than the first game, and it's one that players will always want to have with them, squeezing just a little bit more Mercury out with each try.", "date": "Oct 10, 2006"}
