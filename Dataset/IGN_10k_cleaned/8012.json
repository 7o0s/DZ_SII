However, with additional attention paid to the fielding and batting, a lot of skeptics came around, and MVP 06 was a pleasant surprise.  Attempting to improve on last year's success, EA Canada and EA Sports is releasing MVP 07 NCAA Baseball in time for the opening games of the college season. However, instead of hitting the next gen systems, MVP 07 is coming solely to the PS2.  Is this year's class a hit, or a foul tip?   Last year, MVP 06 changed the way that baseball games were played thanks to the inclusion of analog stick controls.  No longer did players need to hit a button to throw a pitch or swing a bat; instead, a player's success was governed by your timing with the right analog stick.  Rock and Fire Pitching is the newest innovation for MVP 07, and its attempt to recreate the sensation and realism of pitching mechanics completes EA Canada's conceived ~Triple Crown~ of analog gameplay. It took the development team 14 iterations before they landed on one that worked well, and players will be favorably impressed.    The concept behind the system is extremely simple.  Players pick their pitch with one of the face buttons (or the R1, if the pitcher has five pitches in their repertoire).  From there, players choose where they want to place the ball within the strike zone with the left analog stick before they enter their wind up.  This placement affects where the ball will land in the target area within the pitch meter. However, instead of hitting a button to determine the power and the accuracy of the pitch, you use the right analog stick to control these aspects.   Players pull down on the right analog stick to start your wind up, initially setting the amount of power the ball will have as it leaves the pitcher's hands.  As soon as the ball reaches the green area of the meter, players push up and towards the ball icon in the target area of the pitch meter.  The closer the pitch cursor gets to the ball in the pitch meter, the more accurate the pitch will be, and the more likely the ball will go exactly where you want it to.  Aim away from target area or graze the icon and you'll find the ball start to get away from your pitcher.     It takes a little time to get used to, but after you've spent about a half hour or so with the game, you'll be firing strikes across home plate without blinking.  You may also find that once you've played with this pitching system, pressing buttons in other baseball games feels strange. Not only does Rock and Fire make you feel like the pitcher going for a strikeout, it provides you with an additional jump on the ball in case your opponent manages to connect.  This is because the fielding controls (known as Precision Throw Control) are tied to the right analog stick as well, so you don't have to move your fingers in order to pick a player off with a well timed throw from the outfield to the bag.  In fact, some players may find it a tad bit easier to turn a double play now because you don't have to re-adjust from the buttons to the stick.    However, Rock and Fire has a significant Achilles Heel when it comes to multiplayer games.  Baseball fans know that part of the game is deceptively changing your pitches to keep your opponent off guard.  Thanks to the target area on the Rock and Fire pitching meter, batters have an unfair advantage when it comes to knowing whether a ball will be placed to the left, right, or center of the strike zone.  While you might not know whether it'll be high, low or even paint the edges, players will be able to gauge whether they want to put some power behind their swing or simply make contact with the ball.  Even though there's a possible way to mask part of the pitch by pulling the R2 Button at the start of the windup, all an opposing player has to do is watch where the icon travels on the pitch meter and you still have an idea of what direction the ball is going in.  If the Hitter's Eye is turned on, it's even easier to tell if a fastball, curve or other pitch is coming at you.  While you can turn off the Hitter's Eye and even the placement indicator, you can't remove the Rock and Fire pitching meter without reverting back to the old ~classic pitching~ button press system (and that defeats the entire purpose of Rock and Fire, now doesn't it?).   Some of the other analog stick features have received minor adjustments as well.  Some of the baserunning controls, which were tied to the D-pad in last year's game, are now relegated to the left analog stick.  Players will still find a lot more success with the D-pad and the directional buttons when it comes to running the basepaths, although you'll still find a number of your runners in trouble because they can blow through a hold signal and get caught in a rundown. In fact, we noticed a few game situations where we hadn't told a runner to take off and instead they're halfway down the path before they turn around. However, fielding isn't any better when it comes to the Precision Throw Control feature.  There are still some times when you'll go for a diving or sliding catch and the use of the right analog stick will make players throw the ball to either first or third base once the catch is made as a carryover from the stick command.  That's a frustrating problem from last year's game that just hasn't been fixed at all.    Baserunning and fielding aside, there appear to be a few slight adjustments to the Load and Fire system also.  While you still won't be able to adjust the height of your swing, the developers did try to make more adjustments when you try to make pop-ups or grounders on the stick.  It's now a little bit easier to push and pull the ball when you connect, and while you might not completely be able to always time when you want to hit the gap or get a sacrifice fly to score, you'll have a bit more control if you time your swing just right.   Technically, you can try out some of these adjustments within the mini-games that have been included within MVP 07, but these focus primarily on the Pitching aspect of the game. Home Run Showdown and Classic Batting are practically the same mini-games as last year, and make their transition nicely.  However, the four pitching games are variants on the same theme: hurling a ball that corresponds to a specific pitch across the plate at a group of colored blocks to either score runs or add time to an ever-depleting clock.  Don't get me wrong -- the pitching mini-games are a great way to get accustomed to the new analog stick system.  But wouldn't it be possible to vary up some of these things?  Maybe instead of blocks, give the mini-game a shooting gallery theme, with targets that can only be knocked down if you throw the proper pitch in a specific amount of time? It's a minor complaint, but all I'm saying is there are other things to throw at in a strike zone than blocks...    Now, all of these analog stick controls and adjustments have been placed in the game to make MVP 07 feel as realistic as possible. However, the designers also wanted to make the game feel much more authentic this year, and so they tried to beef up the title.  24 new teams and two new conferences, the Atlantic Ten and the Southern Conference, have been added to this year's game, which brings the grand total to 152 playable teams.  While that may be somewhat substantial, the number of stadiums within the game isn't so much -- four new ballparks were added to the game, making only 23 licensed stadiums available for you to play in.     If you do the math (excluding Rosenblatt Stadium, the home of the College World Series), that's only about a seventh of the stadiums for the schools represented.  While it's great to see some realistic stadiums represented, it can be extremely disappointing to know that you could play a number of games at some generic ~Exhibition Field.~ Unfortunately, that seems much more of a problem because the designers chose to release the game on a current gen system than a design flaw, because the generic fields that are included are solid demonstrations of what the Create a Ballpark feature can do.   While the number of fields might be limited, the ability to customize your team isn't.  Players have the opportunity to select between one of five roster styles to determine the strengths and weaknesses of their favorite school's club, such as being great with the long ball but weak in the field and on the base paths.  You can also adjust the bats on your team's rack for better power swings or contact hits.  This all leads up to the option to build your own rosters, so if you don't like the rating that your particular school has, you can customize that team to play exactly the way you want them to.  You might be surprised just how much a couple of these tweaks will adjust the gameplay of exhibition games or tournament matches.   The Dynasty Mode from last year's game returns in all its glory, with year round recruiting as well as various challenges that will pop up during the year that will ask you to achieve certain tasks, like a specific number of strikeouts or runs to earn specialized equipment.  As the year wears on, coaches will need to spend their recruiting points wisely on tactical moves like visiting the scouted prospect, requesting tape, or inviting the young athlete to campus.  However, this year budding coaches will have to deal with the potential draft buzz that a senior or Juco kid may be receiving from the pros.  A Top 100 player could be an excellent asset for your team, but the pros could woo them away from your team regardless of the amount of recruiting points and effort you've put into them with a contract.  That begs the question: do you go after a star, knowing that they might not ever see your school's field, or do you cast your sights lower, knowing that your recruits won't be leaving you any time soon? This balance adds a new and welcome challenge to the recruiting system within the Dynasty mode.    While MVP 07 looks nice on the PS2, it definitely stretches the game's engine to its limits.  There are a couple of frame hitches that will crop up, whether it's during cutscenes, replays or some outfield plays.  Player models still look extremely generic, and it can be hard to distinguish between any single athlete on the field because they all look like mild variants of the Children of the Corn, like lighter and darker skin tones. Animations, however, are still quite good, like the momentum from a sprinting catch that's propelled into a throw. The game still holds onto the television-style camera angles, particularly behind the pitcher for the Rock and Fire pitching system, which is a great touch.  However, you can fault the camera angles for showing off a number of the uglier limitations of the game, such as the bland, cardboard cutout crowd characters, and the dugouts, which will mysteriously be empty during pop-ups, but then be full when the camera cuts closer.   Mike Patrick and Kyle Peterson return to booth duties for MVP 07, and for the most part, their commentary is decent.  Patrick still has a tendency to repeat himself during calls, particularly uttering, ~Are you kidding me?~ at least two or three times a game.  Peterson still doesn't chime in a lot, although he does seem to speak more than he did last year.  However, commentary aside, there are a few differences to the audio in this year's title.  For one, the development team scrapped the rock soundtrack in favor of a fight song soundtrack.  65 separate fight songs have been included in this year's game, although you're going to need to play a rivalry game to actually hear the song during the matchup.  If you don't go up against a rival, you'll only hear the cheer of the crowd and the ping of the bats, which is decent, but still a bit underwhelming. While the stadium sounds are still great, it once again reinforces the feeling that this game would be something special on a next gen console.  MVP 07 is just a bit outside of being an impressive title.  The Rock and Fire system is an excellent way of addressing pitching in a baseball game, but unfortunately the multiplayer complication keeps it from becoming an exceptional feature for this year.  As for some of the other changes to the gameplay, MVP 07 is one of those games that PS2 owners will definitely like, but the age of the engine and limited improvements on the overall product will hopefully push this game over to the next gen systems where it will really shine.", "date": "Feb 6, 2007"}
