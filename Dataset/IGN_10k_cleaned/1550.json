I feel like I'm having dj vu. Isn't this the fifth in the Blair Witch series of games or some junk? I've played them all, so if anyone should know, it's me. In case you didn't get a chance to check them out yourself, let's recap using the patented outline formula of horror game review:   Blair Witch Volume 1: Rustin Parr  Rustin Parr kills seven kids, lets one live. The Stranger, Doc and pals come in to save the day. Saving the day = running through forests for about four hours dodging dogs and Twana stick monsters.   Blair Witch Volume 2: The Legend of Coffin Rock  Same Blair Witch gameplay, less texture. You can actually hit monsters in this one. You may not want to.    The first Blair Witch title had some strong moments, and a pretty tight storyline due to the combination of Nocturne's monster hunters and the Blair Witch mythos, but the game itself was spotty at best. Frustrating controls, bizarre camera problems and frustrating bugs sucked the joy out of the Rustin Parr adventure. Blair Witch Volume 2, while less buggy, lacked the beautiful design and voice acting of the first game. The flatter graphics, and monotonous gameplay kept me from really getting involved with the civil war storyline. The Elly Kedward Tale seems to work a lot better however, largely due to dumping out fistfuls of the Blair Witch storyline while adding some fast action gameplay. Depending on how you like your Blair Witch this could be a good or a bad thing, but in my case it was a welcome respite from the molasses-inspired Volume 1 & 2.  That's not to say that the game doesn't fit in with the storyline at all -- in fact, this might just be the game that you're looking for if you want a complete explanation of who the Blair Witch actually is (Hecaitomix, if you're asking). To make it short, basically white people have, once again, ruined everything for Native Americans in North America, and on top of it, disturbed an ancient and evil spirit that was perfectly happy receiving sacrifices. Ma and Pa Mayflower, not having dealt with ancient evil before -- we are talking pre- AMWAY here -- have made their little town, cut down their little trees, and propagated under The Lord without ever thinking about maybe, possibly tossing poor old Hecaitomix a child once in a while. Of course, once kids start disappearing, it's the local wicca women who get blamed, and Elly Kedward who gets left in the forest to die, tied to a wheelbarrow in the dead of winter. She disappears, people continue to die... and that's where you come in.  You play as Father Prye, an ordained Witch Hunter investigating the Blair community problems. It's 1786, the country is fresh, and the demons are running wild through the forest of America. With a little help from some old school gunpowder, some simple spells, and a few pointy objects, it will be your job to talk to the townspeople, find what to kill, and get to the killing.  Unlike the first two games, conversations are kept pretty minimal, as are the brain puzzles. This is thankfully reflected in the forest as well, which for once is actually laid out in a logical manner. Sure, there are still the same problems with the camera confusing angles and twisting directions around, but the forest is constructed in a general grid this time around, which means that you'll quickly be able to figure out the correct routes, instead of wandering aimlessly. When you hear about a new location that you must visit, it appears on the map to make things even easier. Normally I'd have problems with the game being so arcadey, but after BW1 forcing me to wander back and forth across a huge forest for hours on end, I was overjoyed at the prospect of actually being able to get somewhere quickly for once.  The gameplay also reflects the faster action as well. You've got more weapons this time around, and much wilder ones as well. There are your standard pistols, and of course your giant melee cross, but you'll also have a burning cross to flay your enemies with, spells to freeze monsters in their place, Indian healing sticks, and my personal favorite, a big ol' bag of disease to hurl at the undead, just to mention a few. Sure, you'll also have special inventory items, but using them is pretty much as obvious as it gets. Receive a new item, and you can be sure that you'll have to use it within the next ten minutes for a key moment in the game.  Overall this is actually the best of the three games in terms of gameplay, but probably the worst in terms of respecting the Blair Witch storyline. While the other two games piled on the gothic (read, slowwww) storyline, and kept the action spotty, Ritual decided to go the opposite route and deliver what is basically a pure action game with some Blair Witch mythos thrown on as window dressing. Since the other two games tried to mimic the stylings of the movie, but fell flat when translated to the computer screen, it seems as good idea as any to try to turn Elly Kedward into Commando with the undead.   Of course there's a price to be paid for the emphasis on action, namely lines like:   Goodfellow: You ask as if you've lost your faith in God. Prye: I have.   There's no better setup than that, right? Don't expect Bergman subtleties in the characters, and you'll do just fine. It's probably a good idea not to think about why Puritans are casting wards on witches, and seem nonplussed about combating ancient Indian gods in the spirit realm either. And if you're a huge fan of the first two BW movies, you may not enjoy where this story goes, namely heading to the Indian spirit realm and the demon plane in order to basically kill kill kill everything, and save a couple of kids. On the other hand, if you dug the original Indiana Jones arcade game you'll feel right at home.  Of course, when all is said and done, the third Blair Witch game still bogs down in repetitive action and simplistic puzzles. While Elly Kedward is definitely a lot less tedious than the other two titles, it's far from a stellar product. Even at budget standards, you'd probably be better off saving your money for something a little less repetitive... say Ritual's other game, F.A.K.K. 2. The forest is still the forest, the monsters are identical to those you've seen in the other two titles, and the action is purely low-end Resident Evil. Even the new realms to explore offer the same gameplay, with some new backgrounds to peek at. The graphics and sound won't disappoint you though -- songs loop animal noises to create a background rhythm for some nice noisescapes, gunfire is satisfyingly loud and punchy, and weapons have nice effects. The voice acting is also on par with the rest of the game, as long as you can deal with the talking demons who just can't seem to kick the vocoder habit they've been on since The Exorcist. But overall, it just doesn't grab, even if it does go beyond the reach of the other BW games.  If you have to buy a Blair Witch game this holiday season, then this is the one to get -- it's still buggy (wait until your character walks off the edge of the screen without the camera changing), but less so than the other games, the action's solid, and you'll get the Blair Witch history you've been craving. But if you're just looking for something gothic and grungy to sink your teeth into, you'd probably be better off sitting in your backyard with a flashlight and a video camera. At least then you can make money streaming it on the Internet.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
