Anyone running Windows has access to the game Minesweeper. It's free on your PC. You can probably stop reading this and go play right now. Or you can pay $10 and play a more enhanced version on Xbox. The upgraded visuals still aren't very impressive for a console or even for a free PC game and the variants (Free Edge and Gauntlet) don't offer much beyond the regular game.  If you've never played, here's how it works. A large grid acts as your playing board. There are numerous bombs hidden under the tiles and your job is to sniff out the bombs without turning one up. The idea is pretty smart. Turn over a blank tile and you will see how many bombs are adjacent to it. Using deductive reasoning, while hurrying to earn a fast time, you must decipher the safe spots from the booby-trapped boxes and clear the grid.", "date": "Nov 2, 2004"}
