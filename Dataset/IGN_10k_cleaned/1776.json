But Infogrames saw a gap in the market and put a development team to work to give life to the first Game Boy Color volleyball title, Power Spike Pro Beach Volleyball. This two-on-two summer sport is a decent design on the handheld  all they really needed to do was up the speed and technique to make it a bit more challenging.  Features 20 athletes 5 different locations (one hidden) Secret moves Password save Only for Game Boy Color And it's obvious the developers were inspired by the NES and arcade V-Ball when giving birth to Power Spike, as the Infogrames title has a similar design and control scheme. There's really not much to the game, as the action pretty much sticks to the beach  two athletes on either side of a high net, hitting a large leather ball back and forth until the volley's over. It's a maximum of three hits before the ball has to be sent to the other side, and the ball has to pass from one person to the next   a gentle nudge is an easy return, so it's best to learn the art of a good, hard spike.  The game's a decent videogame version of the sport, as the design allows for earning moves when advancing through the ranks in Power Spike's Championship mode  you can earn power serves and spikes that can be activated by a button combination before the hit of the ball. The graphics are also very well done, both in animation and background techniques. In fact, the developers added a cool 3D effect to the court and net to simulate the change in perspective as the camera scrolls back and forth to follow the action. Very neat  that attention to detail wasn't necessary, but it's great to see it implemented.  Unfortunately, the overall experience is a bit too slow and limiting for my tastes, simply because it really ends up being is a ~follow the pattern~ game. When the ball falls on your side of the court, simply bump the ball to your teammate, let him or her bump it back to you, and then leap up to spike the ball to the other side. The other side will 75% of the time do the same exact thing as a return, so you can learn the timing of the block  and once you've done this, the game is just a formula. If the game's speed was increased to twice what it is now, it would have added a lot to the gameplay simply because you'd have to rush to the spot where the ball's heading. As it is right now, you usually have plenty of time to maneuver your player into position...the game's pace is Power Spike's downfall.  The addition of the game's link cable support is definitely a good thing, since the computer AI is extremely predictable  the game allow the player to chose Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty, but ultimately all this really does is change how often the computer opponents attempt to block a spike. Playing against another human player removes the predictability  it's still a pattern game, but at least human error enters into play.  As the only volleyball game on the Game Boy Color (for now), Power Spike is a decent shot  it just needed a little more tweaking in the gameplay and speed department to make it more intense. It's definitely not a title that's been thrown together  the graphic and animation quality shows that the team put a lot of effort behind the development. But ultimately it's the pace of the game that hurts it.", "date": "Feb 8, 2001"}
