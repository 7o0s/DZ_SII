Yes, the most powerful console on the market gets a port of a board game for the holidays.  Monopoly Party lets you a a few buddies get together on an Xbox and roll some virtual dice.  The mechanics of the game are the same as the old classic, but with the power of the Xbox, several additions were made to create a unique Monopoly experience.  Of course, that unique experience (which we'll discuss soon enough) doesn't make the game worth the price of admission.  It's Monopoly, need I say more?  Monopoly Party comes with plenty of options, some of which are actually pretty cool.  You can choose from a variety of languages, including English (phew), Spanish, and Italian.  This title is clearly meant for the European market as well as you can switch the currency from dollars to English pounds or euros.  The thrill of playing Monopoly with euros instead of dollars, pure joy.  Well, it was either the change to euros or the Wild Turkey, but something sure felt good.  The Party doesn't stop there as you can also adjust the rules to your liking.  The long debate over whether Free Parking offers a jackpot or is just a neutral space can be decided by you.  You can even set the amount of the jackpot.  You also have the choice of the classic Monopoly board or the chance to go with one of several themes: Sci-fi, fantasy, prehistoric, or ancient monuments.  These themed boards feature unique tokens and a variety of house styles to choose from.  The properties are renamed to fit the theme and the center of the board features a 3D animated scene.  You do prehistoric, you can watch dinosaurs romping around the center of the board.  Add to this the fact that every token is animated and you have a type of Monopoly you can only enjoy at home if you're taking Quaaludes.  The let down here is that properties have some really uninspired names.  Since there's no license behind properties, you get generic names like ~Unicorn Road~ and ~Triceratops Terrace~.  And the Chance and Community Chest cards aren't theme-specific, which is a let down.  They don't even have the little cartoon drawings on the cards that we're all so familiar with.  Monopoly Party comes with two modes -- Classic and Party.  With Classic, you have to wait your turn, but in Party Mode you all move simultaneously.  Fantastic.  Or whatever.    It's nice that each token is animated, but those animations are limited and do get old after a few games.  Look, it's Monopoly on an Xbox.  There's no system link and no Xbox Live.  Boo.  Up to four players can get in on the fun, but this game does not translate onto a console very well at all.  The cheesy and repetitive sounds and the fact that you are playing Monopoly on a console -- they just don't work.  No extra effort was made to use the console's power, such as Xbox Live.  And only a few boards which feel a bit generic despite their varied themes?  A half-hearted effort.  Greatest screenshot ever. Hey, I'm all about family time, but buy yourself a real Monopoly board and play with your kids (or whoever you wanna play with).  This looks and feels like a great budget PC game, but it's not that worthwhile on the Xbox.  Though you get several themed boards, they aren't as good as the real life theme boards out there.  Pressing A to roll some dice isn't nearly as enjoyable as rolling them yourself.  I guess if you are lonely and want to play Monopoly against AI, uh, well, that's kind of sad, but understandable.  Not bad technically, but it just seems pointless.", "date": "Oct 15, 2002"}
