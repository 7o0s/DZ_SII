The original console game wasn't exactly top of the heap to begin with, and the conversion wasn't exactly cutting edge, but for GBC standards the game was passable. Not so with the sequel. Midway put the same development team to work on Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2 for the company's debut on the Game Boy Advance -- this game is, without a doubt, the worst US Game Boy Advance launch title. Though the graphic level is up there, the game is nearly unplayable with terrible play mechanics, and worse...it's a fighting game without two-player support. Way to show off the power of the GBA, guys!  Features 11 boxers Training minigames Four game modes Only for Game Boy Advance  The follow-up to Ready 2 Rumble brings back six of the original fighters, plus a couple new boxers as well. It's a three round bout to pummel the crap out of the opposition -- and if you connect your punches properly, you'll be able to build up your RUMBLE meter to pull off a furious Rumble Flurry mode. Advance through the ranks and you'll be able to unlock hidden characters like Michael Jackson and Shaquille O'neal.  We'll give credit where credit is due -- the game does have a handful of decent simplistic and challenging mini-games hidden within it. Choose to play the Championship Mode and you'll be able to access a training mode that consists of five different challenges to build up your character's attributes. The speed bag and weightlifting events are stupid little timing games with very little technique, but the Rumble Pad, Sway Bag, and Heavy Bag are rather cool ~Simon Says~ challenges that aren't as easy as they look. <p but in the ring youre treated to one of clumsiest fighting games ever conceived. controls can be best described as mushy push an attack button and your fighter may or not actually throw a punch. its difficult play game like this when guaranteed if will take swing. sure it has something do with stamina bar at top screen that diminishes you mash on buttons ive had fight just get characters moves combinations are listed manual. though is supposed focus rumble flurry mode fights never last long enough build up power point where physically knock other guy out ring  The Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 versions had a fully 3D graphic engine, but the graphics in the GBA version consist of well-animated prerendered boxer sprites walking on a rotating ring to simulate depth. The game looks rather nice, but 90% of the time you'll find the fight stuck against the edge of the screen, as the camera fails to keep the two sprites in the center of the action.  And what's even more inexcusable -- the Game Boy Advance version doesn't have link cable support for two players. There's only so far you can go playing a fighting game against computer AI...and even if you, for some odd reason, enjoyed the fight in Ready 2 Rumble Round 2, you'd be done with the game in a matter of a couple hours.  Of all the games to hit the shelves during the Game Boy Advance's system launch, this is the one to seriously avoid. A couple of mini-games that could have been done on the Game Boy Color are not enough justification to pick up a copy...the only thing that could have saved this game would have been a link-cable two-player option, and we've been screwed out of that, too.", "date": "Jun 14, 2001"}
