It points to an industry willing to sacrifice creativity and progression for the almighty dollar. Atlus' slightly new-and-improved Ogre battle is case in point.  Compared to the Super NES Ogre Battle, you will notice some major cosmetic changes in the new PlayStation version. Now presented in high-res, the game has completely revamped spells filled with more animations and cool lighting effects. The music has also been punched up, with new redbook audio tracks that sound worlds better than the SNES version. ArtDink has done a solid job fixing up the game for the PSX.  However, it's still the same old game. Even the gameplay itself remains unchanged. Ogre Battle possesses the identical characters, weapons, and levels found in its SNES predecessor. It would have been nice to see ArtDink take Ogre Battle to the 32-bit era, or at least put a foot in the door, instead of re-releasing a game with minute cosmetic changes.   Of course, Ogre Battle may now appeal to a larger audience, especially with the addition of being able to save anytime in battle. If you remember from the first one, you couldn't save your game until the end of each battle - and battles could take as long as three hours!   Although Ogre Battle possesses some of the strongest game elements ever to exist on any console, re-releasing onto the PlayStation with no major changes in the game itself was, in fact, not the best way to use a company's energy and finances. How about some new games?   Jeff Chen", "date": "Aug 9, 1997"}
