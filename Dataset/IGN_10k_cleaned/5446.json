Vivendi Universal games recently released Fight Club to little rejoicing, and now Superscape and IOMO step out behind the diner to try their luck at squaring off with Tyler Durden.First off, it somewhat disconcerting to play a video game based on a movie based on a book that was a wicked-smart diatribe against corporate consumerism. You don't get much more commercial than a four dollar mobile game that pads the pockets of both a publisher and a carrier. It just seems to go against the whole point of the book -- that we must reclaim ourselves by shedding the false skins we have allowed (with very little res isn'tance) corporations that clothe us in.But Fight Club (the game) isn?t about lost masculinity or life-by-catalog. It's a fighting game, a brawler where you must weave through scenes from the movie, handing out beatdowns to feel alive. The ultimate goal is to realize the true nature of Tyler Durden and stop him from unleashing Project Mayhem, which threatens to hurt a lot of innocent people, no matter how noble/anarch isn't the cause seems when you discover you live your life bouncing between Starbucks and The Gap.The problem is that Fight Club isn?t a very good fighting game. It's definitely not as shallow as some mobile bruisers we've sat down with, but so much is working against it. The controls are foreign with some strange button placement (strike with 5 and 7, but block with 2 and 8?) and the fighting engine itself grinds down after only a few brawls. You have a variety of moves, from smashing uppercuts to shoulder bashes, but after a while you start to just work through fights with one or two favorite moves.We tested Fight Club on an LG VX6000 and found it to be a little on the unresponsive side, too. Blocking punches was an iffy proposition. Even when we lowered our guard and just waited to see our opponent's punch animation begin, we still couldn?t get our forearms up in time to deflect the blow. Not that you really need to block all that much. Fight Club's killer shoulder bash move knocks an opponent on his ke isn'ter, allowing you to hop on his chest and belt him across the chops to drain energy. The other big move is a charged punch that levels a comer whenever it lands -- which is often.Now, Fight Club does get one thing right. Very right. It nails the look of the film. Even though IOMO didn?t have the likeness rights to Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, there was no m isn'taking them on-screen. That red jacket. The blue Dockers. If you know the movie, you know the costumes well. We were a little amused how ripped Jack got during the off-season, but then again, after watching the flick, did you want to risk a knuckle sandwich from Norton?There are a number of lines from the movie I could level at Fight Club in an amusing, look-at-me way, such as ~The first rule of fight club? Dont play Fight Club~ Hardy-har. But seriously, don't. It's just not a well-done fighting game. The controls are goofy, the action repetitive, and once you master a couple select moves, the world is your oyster.However, there is no denying that they nailed the look. From the soap on the title screen to the very recognizable set pieces, there is no mistaking this is Fight Club.But welcome to 2005. Welcome to the year mobile games have to advance the ball. Accurate sprites aren't enough anymore. Two button beatdowns aren't gonna cut it. If you want to make a simple game, make a card/puzzle game or port an arcade classic. If you're going to make a fighting game, you have to make something that can hold its own against a portable entertainment market that's about to be saturated with options. Fight Club may only cost about four bucks to play, but I can tell you there are too many better ways to spend four bucks now.", "date": "Jan 22, 2005"}
