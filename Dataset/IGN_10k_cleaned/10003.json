Caught somewhere between the tail end of the full-motion video craze and the dawn of the 3D revolution, it walked a delicate line between pass and cutting-edge, and for that brief moment in time, it was perfect. Years later, it remains a seminal classic but often goes overlooked for the very reasons that once made it seem so fresh.    This was not the first game in the Tex Murphy series, but it was a new beginning. While his first game was an experimental mish-mash of genres, and his sophomore outing a standard point-and-click adventure, Under a Killing Moon was proudly billed as an ~interactive movie,~ a label already facing some backlash as a tide of titles substituting video for gameplay flooded the shelves. But unlike those games, this was a 3D, first-person adventure game with an unrivaled cinematic presentation.    It might be tough for a new generation of gamers to appreciate how amazing this title looked in 1994. During a time of pre-rendered slideshows like Myst, it was natural to glance at Under a Killing Moon, and assume it was the same. But this reviewer will never forget that feeling of awe upon seeing those graphics move and discovering they were real-time 3D. It might seem funny now, but it seemed impossible that these detailed, high-resolution environments full of shadows and nuance could be rendered on the fly.   While other developers like LucasArts and Sierra were simply using the CD-ROM media to add voiceover, Tex's new adventure spanned an unprecedented four CDs, packed with video to illustrate every conversation and major plot point along the way. The cast was an odd mix of Hollywood vets like James Earl Jones, Russell Means, and Margot Kidder, alongside moonlighting computer programmers, with the game's director doubling as its lead character. Surprisingly, everyone seems to pull their weight, with the amateurs hamming it up in comedic roles, and the pros holding down the more dramatic moments.    But Access wisely never let their aspirations of interactive cinema overshadow the actual gameplay. While there's a ton of voice and video to convey the story and dialog, you'll still spend most of your time sleuthing, combing the many 3D environments for clues, and solving the usual inventory and logic puzzles you'd expect from a '90s adventure game. While some small items like keys or cards require a thorough search of the premises, there are usually just enough clues to nudge you in the right direction. If you do get stuck, you can buy hints using in-game points, thanks to an ingenious hint system that remains the best the genre has seen to this day.    Like Guybrush Threepwood, Roger Wilco, or Larry Laffer, Tex Murphy is a classic adventure hero; a bumbling incompetent with more luck than wits. Under a Killing Moon walks the line between comedy and drama, with goofy dialog and sarcastic voiceover contrasting a reasonably complex homage to classic film noir. The story progresses episodically, with Tex solving smaller cases that lead him to uncover a massive global conspiracy. It's not a grand work of fiction, but it's layered enough to have inspired a solid novelization, and both the humor and narrative succeed more often than not.    Later games in the series never managed to recapture Under a Killing Moon's commercial success. Be it the result of poor marketing or just that the moment had passed, Tex's star has long since faded and the adventure genre itself has gone the way of film noir; a lovingly remembered relic, occasionally revisited by a handful of devotees. Under a Killing Moon may no longer be fashionable, and the impact of its innovation has long since dulled, but for those that still hold the flame for this genre, it's every bit as much fun today as it was back then.   Since the decline of adventure games, it seems the classics of Sierra and LucasArts have managed to outshine a lot of equally deserving third-party titles. It might be hard to appreciate how impressive Under a Killing Moon was in 1994, but the approachable design, friendly hint system, and entertaining presentation have helped it to age gracefully, and it has weathered the test of time as one of the best detective games to this day.", "date": "Feb 11, 2008"}
