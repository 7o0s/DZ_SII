After all, Crawfish is a respectable and established Game Boy developer with more than a dozen games under its belt. And the team wrapped up development on the decent conversion of Street Fighter Alpha last year, so why not put the group onto another one-on-one fighter?  I honestly couldn't tell you what happened here  despite the mostly quality product Crawfish has put out in the past, what we end up with is an X-Men fighting game with absolutely no flair or charm, and no focus on gameplay balancing. It's really difficult to praise a game that you can literally play from start to finish simply by tapping the A button repeatedly, and that's exactly why I can't. I'll admit that it was exciting to get the first Activision X-Men game for any system (the PlayStation version will come later this week), but it's obvious the game was rushed to make the movie release...and the game suffers greatly because of this. Features 11 mutants, 2 hidden Training, Story and Battle mode Link Cable support Only for Game Boy Color  Eleven of the most popular X-Men comic book heroes and villains are at your disposal, each having moves based on their comic book abilities  Storm can send a lightning bolt or windblast flying, Wolverine can slash up close with his Adamantium Claws, Gambit can spin around on his staff, and so forth. As these characters fight, a rage meter builds at the bottom of the screen. When it fills, a ~simple~ A+B button push activates a Rage move  I say ~simple~ because, well, it's supposed to work that way, but many times I was left mashing these buttons repeatedly without such results.  The whole idea is to work your way up the ladder to be the best of the best mutant by defeating your opponent in the best of three bouts.  And even though these guys learned a lot about fighters with their great rendition of Street Fighter Alpha, it really looks like none of these skills were employed when they designed X-Men Mutant Acadamy. Computer AI is terrible, even on the highest setting, and once you've stumbled upon the fact that all you need to do is trap the enemy in a corner and tap the punch button, the game's over before you get your $30 worth. That's not an exaggeration, either   most of the characters don't have the powers or moves to keep fights at a distance, so the AI opponents try and jump up out of the way. Once that happens, a single tap sends them back on the canvas. As they get up, they get whalloped as long as you keep hitting that A button. Lather, rinse, repeat...  Don't expect Street Fighter-style moves or anything  many of the characters' special attacks are bland moves you'd expect them to have in their normal set, which must be enabled by the standard Street Fighter control press-button combination. The instruction manual doesn't offer much in the way of how to pull these off, so to find them out you'll have to enter the Training Mode. The fighting isn't spectacular, either...dwarfed entirely by Capcom's and SNK's 2D offering. X-Men doesn't even have a combo system.   Story Mode, the game's main option, is an absolute joke. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't you expect a story in something titled ~Story Mode~? All you get is a text screen halfway through the game's battle ladder, and a text screen when you defeat the final bosses, Apocalypse or Pheonix (the two hidden characters).  The end offers the codes to access these two characters in regular mode (which is odd, since even with the codes I still can't access them).   The only saving grace is the fact that the game actually supports the link cable  it's the first Game Boy Color fighter to use it. The implementation is absolutely flawless, but again  it's the play balancing of the fight engine that makes X-Men Mutant Academy pointless to play. The game boils down to the person who connects with his punch first will win by whittling down the opponent's lifebar. Where's the fun in that? The game needed a heavy month simply in the playtesting and balancing department.  To quote Wolverine during the short, one screen ending: ~Huh. Over Already? I expected more.~ Amen, brother. What the heck happened here? Crawfish had a wonderful entry into the Game Boy Color fighting genre with Street Fighter Alpha, and the only thing missing really was link cable support. We get the development team's second fighter with link cable, and the game itself is flat-out lame. Can't we get the best of both worlds on Nintendo's handheld? Must we resort to the failed NeoGeo Pocket Color for the only true handheld fighting action? Looks that way from here.", "date": "Jul 13, 2000"}
