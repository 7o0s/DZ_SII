Created by veteran designer Hideo Kojima, it marks the continuation of a series that began its life on the MSX home computer, and, later, appeared on NES, the version with which most of us are familiar.  More than two years in the making, Metal Gear Solid retains, at its core, the same gameplay principle made familiar by its predecessors released all those years ago. Emphasis is placed on covert actions, rather than all-out machismo. The importance of this is clearly seen in the game's premise.  Players assume the role of Solid Snake, returning hero from the previous Metal Gear episodes. A special forces operative, he is called back to duty for the purpose of infiltrating the heavily-guarded Alaskan stronghold of his ex-comrades, alone and unarmed.   That's how the game begins. Snake is without weapon, outfitted only with binoculars and a contraband pack of cigarettes. Survival and progress early on in the game is entirely dependent on stealthily killing the base's guards, bare-handed. Snake will come upon plenty of weapons later in his mission, however, but the emphasis on keeping his presence within the immense compound secret (or as secret as possible, to keep things realistically playable) remains of utmost importance.  Gameplay is controlled from an elevated third-person perspective within realtime polygonal environments. Various camera angles are just now and again to provide close-ups on the action, or simply infuse the situation with some cinematic flair. Unlike many games, all of Metal Gear Solid's cut-scenes are generated via its 3D engine.  Progress in the game is kept on a linear path, much like a role-playing game. Plot points crop up often along the way, providing subtle (and sometimes glaring) hints at what you must do next. Snake also remains in contact with his operations center via a satellite up-link. Just as in the previous games, this device operates on various frequencies which, when selected, offer several types of mission-critical data from Snake's support crew ~back home.~  As for Snake's enemies, they aren't merely limited to standard guards. Snake must contend with the six main members of the terrorist group at various points during his mission. Each of them has his or her own specialty (sniping, sharp-shooting, sheer strength). Some take Snake on within the base confines while at least one prefers to attack via helicopter. We'll keep the rest secret.  Long considered the most ambitious PlayStation title ever envisioned, Metal Gear Solid is here at last. Is it everything we expected? Let's hear it straight from the review crew...I'm in awe. An admittedly ambitious project from the very beginning, Metal Gear Solid has managed to deliver dutifully on all of its promises. From beginning to end, it comes closer to perfection than any other game in PlayStation's action genre. Beautiful, engrossing, and innovative, it excels in every conceivable category.I must warn, however, that first time players absolutely must go through the training stages before heading into the game itself; failure to do so will put you at an extreme disadvantage, as this definitely isn't merely a ~run around, guns blazing~ action game. Once the concept and control settles in, you're in for the single greatest gameplay experience possible on PlayStation. What can I say? Hideo Kojima has come through and produced the finest PlayStation game ever. My hat is off to him, and Konami, for delivering a game that proves, once and for all, that exceptional gameplay doesn't have to take a backseat to technical majesty. This is one game that every PlayStation owner should experience first-hand. Clich as it may sound, ~go get a copy. Now!~ You won't be disappointed.", "date": "Oct 22, 1998"}
