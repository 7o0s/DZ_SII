Defender, Side Arms, M.U.S.H.A., Darius, Pulstar, R-Type and many, many others drew in crowds dazzled by the explosive special effects, swarming army of enemies, and reflex gameplay.  Believe it or not, these 2D shooting games were not easy at all, and it wasn't uncommon for players to die repeatedly.  Yet even dying over and over again didn't deter players from these games, for all that mattered was to be the top ace, the big dog, and even ~da man~, by getting the top score.  Yes, scores actually mattered back in those days and 2D ~twitch~ gaming seemed to be here to stay, and all was well.  Then came the storm known as 3D.  With its fresh looks, and greater freedom in the environment, 3D games soon came to bask in the same light held by the 2D shooters.  And for a time, it seemed both could co-exist equally.  But 3D was not content with sharing the glory, and soon, more and more games featured more 3D features, while 2D was often said to ~look the same~.  And then, came the new generation of gamers, those that never knew the wonder of 2D animation - never laid their eyes upon the gigantic bosses of Gaiares, experienced the cool helper mechanics in M.U.S.H.A, the excellent arcade Macross shooter, or the legendary ThunderForce series.  This new generation greeted the 3D world like those old veterans did with 2D, and soon the 2D shooting era died... and rather quickly if I may say.  Today, 2D shooters are rare indeed, as there are few gamers that actually ~get~ the reflex gameplay of the genre.  Thankfully, it seems those companies that still bring out these wonders today are the ones that do it the best: Raizing, Psikyo, and most of all, Treasure.  And whether you're one of those ancient dinosaurs who hug their copy of Soukyugurentai to sleep, or a Dreamcast owner looking for a game where you blow everything up, Bangai-O has it all: tons of enemies, the ability to blow anything to smithereens, and lots and lots of oranges.  Released first on the N64 (lucky bastards), Bangai-O is a pure shooting game.  Oh sure, there are light puzzle elements thrown into the mix, but there's really nothing that distracts the player from the main emphasis here: blowing up everything.  Even the story is unimportant, though its told with that good old Treasure wackiness that fans have come to expect with a grin, and new gamers will respond with a bewildered ~huh?~ expression.  Take control of pilots Riki and Mami, suit up in the Super Explosive Bangai-O suit and blast off as you take on the evil forces of the intergalactic crime syndicate, the SF Kosmo Gang.  This evil group has smuggled ~space fruits~ thoughout various space stations in order to finance their evil causes.  So invade their bases, blow up everything, and grab the fruit.  Sound easy (and weird), right?  Well, of course the SF Kosmo Gang isn't just going to sit idly while you grab the fruit, as swarms of enemies will hinder your progress, as well as tough boss characters.  Of course, you're suited up in the SUPER EXPLOSIVE POWER SUIT Bangai-O with two firing modes, Riki Mode (homing missiles) and Mami Mode (reflecting laser shots).  You'll be switching between both modes frequently: you'll encounter situations where you're surrounded by enemies that are easily handled in Riki Mode, while in tight pathways with gunners waiting for you to pass through, the reflecting lasers of Mami Mode are best-suited.  Movement is handled with two control setups  the D-pad controls the movement of your robot and Analog pad shoots or the D-pad controls the movement of your robot and the Dreamcast face buttons (X, Y, A, B) shoots.  So, who have total freedom of movement and the ability to deliver firepower in any direction, any time.  Oh, did we mention the handy, and necessary, Super Bomb attack that releases a flood of shots in every direction?  And the more enemies on screen at a time, the greater number of shots you'll release with this Super Bomb attack.  And if you think you're one of those ~I don't need a Super Bomb button cuz I'm the shooter king~ types, you'll think again, especially when taking on boss attacks.  Besides, there's nothing more spectacular than releasing over 400 shots ala Robotech-style.  The visuals are classic 2D with some nice special explosive effects.  The game rarely slows down, only occurring when the screen is filled with enemy, enemy fire, and the ~death blossom~ Super Bomb shots.  And it wouldn't be right for a Treasure game not to include just plain weird art whenever they can.  For example, whenever you die (and you will, so don't be discouraged), you're greeted with a screen of Riki skipping through a garden naked, being led by what a hooded figure holding a candle on a stick.  Delightfully strange is the best description I can come up with, and you'll come across all this wonderfully weird art as you battle your way through 40 plus levels.  40 LEVELS!  When was the last time you played a game with that many levels? (Ed's Note: Um...Tempest 3000 with 120 plus levels? Thanks P.B.)  For the life of me, I can't recall any recent game I've even heard about having such length.  Gripes?  I really can't think of too many, though I think it would've been nice to add a two-player mode to the game.  While the overall music is alright, it could be revved up a bit more.  The visuals aren't exactly state of the art, especially since this game is technically over a year old.  Then again, when some of you readers see the 2D visuals, you might start making comparisons saying it doesn't look anything more than a glorified Robotron.  But I implore you readers to give this wondrous 2D shooting game a chance, and if you die a few times or so, don't shut it off.  Just keep blowing up more stuff, evading the numerous missiles and enemies, and collecting more fruit.  Maybe you'll start to feel that satisfaction of surviving an onslaught of baddies without getting hit, and from there, you'll get that thrill as you release hundreds of missiles on your pitiful foes.  Maybe then, you'll ~get~ why the 2D shooting genre is definitely a treasure that should not be forgotten.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Jan 18, 2001"}
