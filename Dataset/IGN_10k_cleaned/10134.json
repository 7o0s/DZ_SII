Lords of Thunder is one of the most highly praised shooters of its age, and of all time. It first appeared on the TurboGrafx-CD system in 1993, and was immediately flocked to by thousands of fans for its superb balance of gameplay, graphics and hard-edged sound; all of which were tied together by an anime-inspired presentation and a story that, for once, was not about a lone starship pilot facing off against invading aliens in space. You instead command a single man in Lords of Thunder, a warrior named Landis who flies through the air not by piloting a vehicle, but by drawing upon the magic of one of four special suits of armor.   Each of the four suits is based on an elemental force -- there's Fire, there's Water, there's Wind and there's Earth -- and each of the four has a different style of offense. The Wind Suit sends out lightning bolts that pierce through multiple enemies. The Earth Suit launches bombs toward the ground. The Fire Suit projects arcs of flame, of course, and the Water Suit washes foes away with waves of flying surf. Each suit is suited to different styles of play, and players will likely find that one of the four suits their personal preference (though the Water one is clearly the most powerful).   Flying electric anime swordsmen take on two-headed fire-breathing dragon chickens. Sounds about right. After picking your favorite wardrobe option, you then get to have your choice of location. Like the old Mega Man games, Lords of Thunder presents its stages in any order you wish: you're given the option to attack any of six different levels from the start, and after clearing each of the six the seventh and final stage is unlocked. The freedom in stage selection is nice, but it also means that there's no casual ramp-up of difficulty in the game's progression from level to level. Lords is tough from the start, and stays that way the whole time you play.   The action is fast and relentless, as you'll constantly need to dodge enemy fire and avoid collisions with environmental hazards as you continuously fill the screen with your own counter-attacking ordnance. One hit doesn't kill you in Lords of Thunder, thankfully, but that fact doesn't make things any easier --getting tagged by foes drops your health meter and can also power down your offensive abilities. Alternatively, if you fly a clean run and gather the floating power-ups left behind by fallen foes, you can make yourself more powerful and upgrade your Suit's power. The fully-upgraded Water Suit is a sight to behold.   Lords of Thunder would have been a perfectly compelling gameplay experience with all that in place alone, but one last element ties everything together and polishes the presentation: the shop. You'll constantly collect floating crystals as you play through each stage in Lords, and those gems can then be used as currency in-between action stages to purchase health boosts, offensive upgrades, screen-clearing bombs and the like. The shop adds an extra element of strategy to the game that's intriguing. Should I spend my cash boosting my health meter, hoping that I'll then be able to survive an extra couple of hits? Or should I just max out my offensive power and trust that I'll be able to blow every bad guy out of the sky before he's able to hit me? Or, further, should I worry about the shop at all? Spending the focus to swoop around the screen to grab as many flying gems as possible can put you in harm's way, so it's all about balancing out your approach.   Lords of Thunder is just a blast all the way around, and it's finished off with a soundtrack that's truly memorable and praiseworthy. Many of the games from the TurboGrafx-CD have had impressive soundtracks thanks to the disc-based media they were originally developed for. But Lords of Thunder's songs, which feature an emphasis on guitar and are full of energy, are especially excellent. Like Gate of Thunder before it, you'd be well served to crank up the volume for this one.Like Gate of Thunder before it, you'd be well served to immediately invest here. There are lots of shooters out there, and certainly lots of TurboGrafx shooters too, but Lords of Thunder is one of the best -- a game that's been praised since its original release 15 years ago and that proves to still be just as compelling and energetic today. Diehard shooter fans should have this, Gate of Thunder and Gradius III all for all time. Get to it!", "date": "Mar 4, 2008"}
