{"name": "Desert Strike Advance", "name_review": "Desert Strike Advance", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/03/desert-strike-advance", "text": "is a damn-near perfect conversion of an excellent Genesis game that kicked off a long line of action games, from Jungle Strike to Urban Strike...even Nuclear Strike on the PlayStation. It's also one of the more difficult games made for the system...and because it's a direct port, the immensely challenging game design is completely intact. This game is perfect for those tired of trouncing through a GBA game in a matter of a couple of hours; yes, there are only four different maps, but believe it when we say this is not a romp in the park. It's a fun romp, though...and well worth it if you haven't done it in the other Desert Strike incarnations on other systems. Features Four levels 27 missions Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  The conversion of Desert Strike Advance was performed by Budcat Creations, Electronic Arts' go-to guys for its GBA console ports. The team's previous projects were GBA ports of Madden NFL 2002 and NHL 2002...Desert Strike Advance is arguably the first Genesis title these guys have converted over to the handheld near perfectly. While both Madden and NHL were decent titles in their own right, each had their technical faults that stuck out during gameplay. The conversion Desert Strike Advance, on the other hand, is exactly like playing the Genesis game. No slowdown or graphical glitches to speak of...it's a damn fine conversion, absolutely.  And what's more, the gameplay of Desert Strike is just as fun as it was when it was released on the Genesis a decade ago. Players must fly their Apache-type helicopter (it may not be licensed, but it looks really close) in low-altitude formation, attacking enemy camps and structures with guns, missiles and hydras. Each map has its own set of missions to complete, and while the missions can be completed in any order, the order is definitely important since one task may be connected to the success of a succeeding task. The helicopter is pretty strong but it's not invincible, as it will be attacked from all sides by enemy troops, anti-aircraft guns and missiles. Plus, you'll need to keep an eye on your fuel and ammo gauges...they can be replenished by scooping up tanks and crates scattered all over the desert, sometimes hiding within enemy structures. Your craft's armor can be beefed back up by rescuing MIA soldiers lost in the desert.  Did we mention how difficult this game is? Prepare for a serious challenge, since the helicopter is the only target for these guys to shoot at...well, except for the occasional firefight your MIA soldiers will get into against enemy troops. This game is more of a trial-and-error design, since it's near impossible to complete an entire map without losing all three of your choppers. Basically, you'll have to figure out the proper path of which to approach enemy camps and structures, and learn where the heavy artillery sits on the map so you can sneak up on them without them even having the opportunity to get in a shot against your craft. Players can simplify the action by changing the controls to remove the inertia of the helicopter, basically making it stop and start on a dime...but the default control scheme feels great, even if it takes a bit to get used to. You'll also have to learn that the collision detection with your weapons isn't exactly spot on...this was one of the Genesis version's real problems, and this issue's carried over to the GBA.  The graphics are ripped right out of the Genesis version, down to the pixel-art cutscenes of a fat Saddam look-alike and a General Swartzkoff-type commander. The imagery was excellent for Genesis standards, and while it looks good on the GBA, the limitations do shine through. The Genesis could only handle so many on-screen colors, so the original developer dithered pixels to give the illusion of deeper hues in the sand. This dithering effect is still in place on the GBA version...it's definitely not a bad thing, just don't expect to be wowed by vibrant color use. The audio is more out of the SNES version, with digitized effects used for the helicopter, weapons fire, explosions...all mixing together during the action. Thankfully, the lame music only stays on during the mission briefings. I've played Desert Strike on the Genesis, SNES, and Atari Lynx, and the Game Boy Advance conversion sticks to a great formula, making it as good as, if not better than the original Genesis version. My one real complaint: it still requires a password to access the other three maps...a cartridge save would have made the game a lot better than the original, since it could have also recorded player statistics and scores. But it looks like EA only wanted a direct port...and nothing more than that. And this decade-old game still works, especially as a handheld action title.", "date": "Jun 3, 2002"}
