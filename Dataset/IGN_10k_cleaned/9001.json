You must answer a series of trivia questions, winnowing the mob down to a manageable size. If you screw up and miss a question, the mob gets your winnings.   Gameloft fuels the game with 700 questions that range from history to pop culture. In a single game, I was asked about Howard Stern, Slobodan Milosevic, roman numerals, the movie ~Awakenings,~ The Rock, and bubble gum. (Sadly, there was also a Paris Hilton question.) If you answer a question correctly, any member of the mob that answered wrong is dismissed. The questions get tougher as you close in on shutting out the mob, but the stakes increase too. After just a few rounds, you're banking upwards up $30,000 for wiping out a swath of the mob.   There are three difficulty levels. On the easy setting, 1 vs. 100 is a push-over. You'd get a bigger challenge out of finding your car keys. Medium mixes it up with some pretty simple questions at the start but finishes with some tough trivia. The hardest setting is actually the most fun. You're not inundated with just pop culture questions. You'll also be hit with matters of the state, politics, and geography between answering Gwen Stefani and video game trivia questions.   You have ~helps~ to assist with tricky questions, such as polling the mob or trusting the mob's judgment. Choosing whether or not to trust the mob isn't necessarily an art. These people want you gone, so consider whether or not you really should place much faith in them. Gameloft game also includes the ~Sneak Peek,~ a new feature recently added to the show that shows off the next question, but none of the answers. You are given this peek to decide whether or not to keep going.    Oh, and there is a timer on each question so you can't be a total wanker and hit Wikipedia.   The game faithfully recreates the set of the game show, although the likeness of host Bob Saget is nowhere to be seen. The world needs more Saget on mobile phones. The stand-in host, dressed nattily in all black, gets right up to the screen, waving and beckoning. There is a little bit of digitized voice. I thought having the crowd catcall when you must choose between taking your winnings or keep playing was a nice touch.  I've only seen a couple episodes of 1 vs. 100 on television, but I definitely preferred the mobile game for one reason: Pacing. While the TV slow is dreadfully slow, you can burn through the mob and get back to work within just about ten minutes. If you like quiz show games, Gameloft's take on 1 vs. 100 is a good download. It's wholly disposable, but sometimes you're just in the mood for disposable fun.", "date": "Sep 7, 2007"}
