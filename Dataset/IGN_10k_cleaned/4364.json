Each month, it seems another one is being announced and it is becoming difficult for fans of these games to choose which one to play. There are as many gameplay styles as there are MMOs, though, so each game hitting the market is as viable as the next. Horizons: Empire of Istaria is Artifact Entertainment's contribution to the recent flood of MMOs. It hopes to draw players bored with their existing games by offering an in-depth crafting system, a promised battle with the Withered Aegis and a world of fantasy.   There are nine races from the bipedal species like Fiends, Elves and Humans, to what may be the most unique feature of this game, the Dragons. The options for customizing appearance aren't as deep as those in Star Wars Galaxies, but they are better than the older MMOs. Character creation is pretty simple and the only permanent choices made at the beginning are race, body type, facial appearance and name. Every other selection for your character is made in game and few choices will ever be the type where you feel stuck.   There is a tutorial to take you through the basics, but the game's interface is pretty intuitive as it is. It is very customizable -- from the chat colors to window placements and transparencies to key mapping. After learning the basics, you are whisked off to a newbie area, where you can get your bearings. Signs will point you to all the important areas, like resources and monsters. This makes your first few hours in the game bearable, as MMOs are always known for their complexity. Most new players will hang out in this area until they reach level 10 or so, at which time they'll probably tour the impressive cities. Each city is different from the next, from the jeweled fiery caves of Dralk where the dragons reside to the brick structures of Kion, the home of the Saris's Lady Kendra. There are many NPCs in each town, from simple trainers for the different classes to those that will share a story or give a task.   The ability to multi-class allows for unlimited customization of your character. There are several base classes to choose from as well as prestige classes which will normally require that you have joined more than one base class to get statistics up. For example, the Battlemage prestige class has requirements in both one hand slash and flame statistics in order to join. One hand slash can be improved by being a warrior or a scout (base classes) and the only way to improve flame is by joining the mage school. You can switch schools as often as you'd like and you never lose levels or anything by doing so. Theoretically, you can level up every base school to 50 and dabble in every prestige school, but doing so might not be in your characters best interest, as there may be a penalty associated with experience gain due to a rating calculated by your levels in all schools.    The crafting system is another positive. For those who have played A Tale in the Desert, Horizons crafting will initially feel familiar. In order to craft items, players must collect raw resources using various tools, then use machines to create either advanced resources or items. Items can be further customized by an adept crafter with techniques and crystals. Like the adventuring class system, crafting classes come in two flavors, base and prestige. The three base classes -- scholar, blacksmith and outfitter -- set the tone for a crafter's future life. Since every usable item in the game is crafted, there is plenty of work for the handy. Crafters will also be tasked with rebuilding bridges, hollowing out caves and constructing homes. The rebuilding is dynamic and players will be able to see the results of their hard work pretty quickly.    There are quite a few NPCs in game with quests and tasks for you. First, the school trainers will always have a task for you. Adventuring tasks usually involve killing a set number of a certain type of enemy, such as ~kill 10 Winter Wolves.~ Crafting tasks will ask you to make a number of items for your crafting school. Completing tasks for trainers results in an experience reward. There is a minor bug involved in adventuring kill tasks - one that will hopefully be soon addressed. The bug requires you to kill one more mob of that type in order to gain your full experience reward for completing the task. However, killing 11 instead of 10 is not so annoying and easily overlooked.   Other quests are those like the Gregory the Darkstaff Scholar quests, usually carry tasks with a twist. One involves finding a Summoner tower out on a remote island. You are given the coordinates and told to run there - it is quite a long run. In order to get to the island, you have to find some shallow land to cross onto the island. The run itself is quite dangerous and it actually took me four tries to make it out to the island safely. These tasks serve two purposes: to earn some experience and to explore more of the land of Istaria. Something for the higher level people to try their hand at, and that no other game has ever done before, is the freeing of subjugated races. There are races, like the Satyrs, which are imprisoned by the Withered Aegis. Players can free them, although the way is complicated and will require several steps. Once freed, these races become playable.   Then there are the weekly events. So far, there have been three, and a fourth is about to begin. One of the weekly events added some festival NPCs, from whom you could buy unique items and learn more of the history of the land. The last event added in a few more NPCs and told a tale of a lost expeditionary force. Many a player searched for hours trying to find a clue to their location without luck. The next event looks to give us more clues about what really happened to this force, possibly allowing us to even find it.    One of the things AE is proudest of is their ability to change the world without ever bringing down the servers. The NPCs added for the expeditionary force event, for example, just appeared one day on the servers. They do have periodic maintenance during which they bring the servers down, but it has been relegated to early morning hours when few people are playing.    The combat system is familiar to anyone who has played an MMO before. There are standard repeating attacks as well as special moves and even combat stances for hand to hand melee. Spells do not require a pool of mana or anything like that to cast; instead they are on a timer. So, as a mage, you may only be able to cast your really high damage spell once every 3 minutes, but you have several other spells on shorter timers as well as repeatable spells. The high damage spell can be used as an initial attack or a finisher. Tactics come into play when combating difficult mobs, no matter what class you play.     The graphics are done well, although they aren't as crisp as Asheron's Call 2 or Star Wars Galaxies. The environments range from lava pits to grasslands to the frozen tundra and are especially pleasing to look at. The Dragon character models are superior, and the choices for customization are pretty varied -- no two dragons I've seen even come close to looking alike -- and there are a lot of people trying out dragons right now. A few of the other character models are also really attractive, like the Fiend (blue avatars with pointy ears) and the Saris (cat-like characters). However, some definite work can be done to the human, elf and a few of the other character models, to bring them up to the same levels. A lot of the mobs are really cool looking as well and you have to give kudos to the artists, they've done a good job.   One of the biggest complaints you'll hear about the graphics, though, is that even high end machines have problems with graphics lag when trying to turn them all the way up. I had the graphics on my machine at about halfway and I still thought it was a very pretty game. Turning it up higher, though, brought the game to a standstill. Horizons is also a memory hog. Machines with less than 512 MB will likely have to turn their graphics all the way down. Some animations are really great and others could use some work. A few of the spells animations make you sit up and take notice the first time you see them. Dragons move realistically, but bipedal running is a little awkward to watch. Eventually, Dragons will start to mature and then we'll get to see them soaring the skies above us, something that will add a whole new dimension graphically to the game.   One place where the game truly shines is the ambient music. The musicians who worked on this game did a stellar job. Each area of the game has its own music, and the music changes according to what you are doing -- whether engaging in combat or just walking along peacefully enjoying the scenery. More dangerous areas will have music that will put you on edge. Also, sound effects are very nicely done, from combat and spell sound effects to the boom of thunder when you enter blighted areas. The sound is definitely a plus for Horizons.   What isn't a plus are the bugs. This issue has plagued every MMO from the dawn of time and Horizons is no exception. There are no showstoppers, but there are many that can become extremely annoying. There is one bug that sometimes causes hotkeys to get stuck, making it impossible to cast a spell or execute a special move. Naturally, this always happened to me when I most needed that spell in order to survive and sometimes resulted in my death. Logging off and back on will unstick the key. However, the incredibly long load times when starting the game make this even more frustrating. You'll sit and watch a screen loading for at least 2 minutes, if you are on the lucky end. During busier hours, I've noticed loading times of 5 minutes and more.    Another problem comes with casting lag. This seems to only happen to me when I'm casting repeatable spells, but it is frustrating because you see the mob hitting you, and then all of a sudden, you'll hit the mob 4 times in a row, killing it. It can be scary because you'll be down to 10 health and the mob will have 100 -- before the lag catches up. While this rarely resulted in my death, if I gauged everything right, it can be annoying and definitely takes you out of the game while you sit and wait and hope the lag catches up before you die.    Other minor bugs exist - like not being able to get a new quest unless you log off and back on rarely. Sometimes, you'll end up under a building instead of inside it when you teleport. And I've already mentioned about the kill an extra mob bug. There is also some imbalance with classes -- class balance is always a struggle. One class, Elemental Archers, had a skill that made them overpowered, so Artifact remedied it and, as always, an outcry was made by the players affected. Balancing will probably be something that will continue to be an issue. There are still many MMOs that have been on the market for years and haven't quite figured out the answer to this. The upside is that there is no player versus player combat. Balance isn't quite as important in Horizons as in a game like Dark Age of Camelot or Shadowbane, where Player versus Player is the endgame. Also, pretty much any class can solo; grouping is not forced, so choosing a perfect grouping class isn't as important. Finally, there is a lack of high end content for adventurers, so players who spend a lot of time playing and level pretty quickly might find themselves bored when they reach a certain level. Crafters never really run out of content and the high-end game for them is even better than the low-end game.   Probably what I find to be the most disappointing is the level of communication from Artifact. They have recently hired their community manager, and his newness explains partially why information has been so stilted. The holiday season is probably another reason. However, many players don't care about either of these excuses; they simply want better communication. Hopefully, we'll soon seen a marked improvement with a more updated list of known issues, a priority listing and state of the game article done regularly, and more frequent posting on the message boards by their community manager.    Horizons has its share of problems, from bugs to class imbalances, but in general its first month has gone pretty smoothly. There hasn't been too much downtime, and since I started playing, there hasn't been a single time I wanted to play and couldn't because the server was down. None of the bugs are showstoppers and class imbalances are relatively unimportant except for overachievers who like to be the best and the first. Horizons is a community game, though, where players have to come together to rebuild the world and fight back the ever present threat of the Withered Aegis, so what benefits one player benefits the entire community. The ability to totally customize a character through multi-classing, the dichotomy of adventuring and crafting, the crafting system that will make most crafters extremely happy, plenty of low level content, good graphics and incredible music, along with a deep lore is worth a look if you think those things might be of interest to you. Like most MMOs, the game is what you make it.", "date": "Jan 8, 2004"}
