There are never any huge strides in functionality or design. Instead they just slap some new units and maps into the box and try to convince you that you ought to play it. And since it's only twenty bucks, you've really got no right to complain. Firestorm definitely turns that assumption around and offers a substantially new experience in the world of Tiberian Sun. While I wasn't completely impressed with the new units, the new campaigns and multiplayer options are more than worth the price of admission.  First off, Kane is dead. I remember watching the end of the GDI campaign in Tiberian Sun and thinking, ~There's not way Kane's coming back from that.~ And I was right. Rather than going into any great detail about the story, I'll just say that Kane's death has opened up a whole new conflict for the GDI. The CABAL, reactivated by Slavik, promises to bring NOD back into the game. As if that wasn't bad enough, Tiberium is spreading across the globe and devastating almost all life. Your first job is to recover the Tacitus (didn't I do this already in TS?) and halt the spread of Tiberium.  From here you dropped into one of Firestorm's two excellent campaigns. In terms of narrative the 18 campaign missions are tied together very well -- much better than in Tiberian Sun. What's more, the missions mirror each other almost exactly. This allows you to play both sides of the conflict while following the same paths (and using many of the same maps). While some people would prefer separate story lines and location for the two campaigns, it's a nice touch here as it allows you to achieve a Judy Collins effect. I'm not explaining that one. Another thing that particularly impressed me about the missions, especially considering the previous game, was the assortment of objectives. Tiberian Sun suffered unfortunately from the ~kill everything~ mission design. Firestorm offers a few more missions where you can accomplish your objectives and move on while there are still plenty of enemies on the map. The maps themselves are pretty good if a trifle repetitive but thankfully Westwood decided to cut the number of bridges and tunnels in this pack.  While Firestorm adds several new units and upgrades the abilities of the older ones, the additions are mostly in the area of combat support rather than pure offensive power. Not that that's a bad thing; it just makes the games a little more subtle. Both GDI and NOD have mobile war factories that make reinforcing your attacking force a lot easier. Just plop one of these babies down just behind your front and keep pumping out the units. Each side can also produce drones that bury themselves underground and attach themselves to passing enemy vehicles. The drones slow down units and alert you to their presence. The GDI can detect these drones with the help of a Deployable Sensor Array and can wipe them out with their EMP cannons. It helps to counter the already significant defensive advantage that NOD already enjoys.  The jump-jet infantry have been upgraded in terms of speed but they've also been given the ability to spot cloaked units and structures. In actual practice this winds up being only marginally useful. Since the ability doesn't work when the jump jet infantry are stationary, it's a poor substitute for the MSA. As for searching out NOD bases, they become easy prey for nearby SAM sites. The only new, truly offensive unit on the GDI side is the Juggernaut. This is really just a walking artillery platform and, while great for taking out NOD bases, it has little practical use in the mid-game skirmishing that goes on. Still, it can't be beat for range or firepower and if it didn't have to deploy to a stationary position to fire, it would be the best unit in the game. It also goes a long way to reducing (but not wholly eliminating) that significant defensive advantage enjoyed by the NOD.  The GDI also have access to an addition to the Upgrade Center in the form of a Drop Control Plug. This allows the GDI player to send veteran units in Infantry Drop Pods to any section of the map. While it's not a game winning strategy, it can certainly act as a good diversion or supplement to your main attacks. The GDI also have a less powerful version of the EMP cannon that can roam about the battlefield. Not only can it disrupt units on the ground, but it can cause subterranean units to surface as well. Still for all the new units, you can't beat the Titans and MLRSs.  The NOD only get two new exclusive units. The Mobile Stealth Generator is a miniature version of the stationary Stealth Generator. It's a great asset in battle but must be deployed (read: immobile) to work. Two or three of these can be used leapfrog fashion to march your forces right up to the enemy's base. Most of the attention will be on the new Reapers employed by NOD. These spidery cyborgs look very menacing at first (the first time I saw them I was on the receiving end of their attack) but they have some limitations. They're undoubtedly very useful, but only in particular situations and only with lots of friendly support. They can launch an anti-personnel web that incapacitates infantry. The big problem is that the Reaper's missile launchers aren't designed to take out prone infantry. You'll need other units to actually kill the little guys.  Firestorm also ships with several new multiplayer maps (most of which are quite good, if a little similar) and a map randomizer. This feature works pretty well and has sliders and toggles for several options from Tiberium density to including night and day transitions to setting ion storms. Most impressive on the multiplayer side of things is the World Domination Tour. It's a persistent online fight for control (or domination, if you will) of the world. The world map is divided into numerous territories and you and anyone else who want to can fight for control of contested territories. At the end of each day, the side with the highest victory level in any given territory is given control of the territory. And the next day it starts all over again. Although it's a little more complicated than that, it's a remarkably simple idea that will help give a broader context to your online skirmishing.  Production-wise these games have always been fantastic. While there haven't been any huge graphic leaps over Tiberian Sun, the new units have been integrated into the overall look of the game with little fuss. Music is good but the sound effects, while adequate, are occasionally unintentionally humorous. At least I hope it was unintentional. The FMV portions of the game are as good as ever minus the presence of Michael Biehn and our old pal, James Earl Jones. I guess you can't really hold that against the game, but I'm still trying to find a way.  Firestorm is a fantastic add-on for fans of the original game. While I would have liked to see a little more balancing in terms of units, it's good that Westwood has preserved the strengths and weaknesses of the two sides. The NOD still has the edge in stealth and defensive emplacements and the GDI still has some incredibly resilient units as it should be. Although the huge number of well designed missions are loads of fun, the multiplayer aspects of Firestorm are more than enough to warrant a recommendation to any fan of Tiberian Sun.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Apr 11, 2000"}
