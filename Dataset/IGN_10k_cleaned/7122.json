With countless clones and gameplay that has stood the test of time, Pac-Man can evoke nostalgia in just about every gamer out there.  If you've played Pac-Man before, you won't find anything new here. This is the old-school game that has stolen your quarters since the advent of the arcade with little else to pique your interest. Pac-Man on the XBLA is a good arcade port, but it will probably leave you wanting a bit more.    If you weren't happy with the recent release of Galaga, you'll find similar faults with Pac-Man. There is only the option for single-player gaming so you won't be alternating turns with a friend competing for the high score. Instead, you'll be posting your score onto the online leaderboards which may well be a dream come true for some Pac-Man addicts.    Also similar to Galaga is the static background on which the game is placed. The playing field itself has the retro appearance you'd expect. The background looks nice, but contrasts sharply behind the old-school maze. You can adjust the size of the playing field and slide it around on the background, but since the maze is taller than it is wide, you'll always be left with about two-thirds of your screen covered with the static background. The sounds are faithfully recreated to the original arcade cabinet standard as well. While it is nice to see these games held to their roots, options for updated sounds or graphics would be welcome.   Clyde is coming for you. The only real option that exists is to change how many lives you start with or which score you must obtain to receive a bonus life. This is nice for those who are just beginning and need a little extra help or the maniacs who want more of a challenge. If you do adjust the parameters, you'll find that you can't post your score on the leaderboards.    Hardcore Pac-Man fans may find something to gripe about with the controls. You can use either the d-pad or the analog stick to navigate Pac-Man through the maze. The d-pad doesn't work well enough to be a good option and most people will likely stick with analog control. Although this works adequately, you may find yourself occasionally missing turns or turning before you want to. It takes some getting used to and an arcade stick would be much preferable. Still, it works better than the broken down Pac-Man cabinet at the local pub.    Most of the achievements in Pac-Man revolve around eating the fruit that pop up after eating a certain number of Pac-Dots in each stage or reaching a specific level. If you haven't played much Pac-Man in the past, reaching level 22 might seem like an impossible task. To help novice players along, a level select mode has been included allowing you to begin on the highest level previously reached. This won't help you reach any new high scores, but obtaining most of the achievements becomes a simple matter of putting in the time.   Getting the achievements isn't overly difficult. For 400 Microsoft Points ($5 USD) the game doesn't offer much bang for your buck, especially considering how many compilations this game has appeared on at budget prices. Pac-Man fans will be pleased that the gameplay is the same and the sounds will bring you straight back to the dark arcades of yesteryear. However, the options are thin and, unless you're a Pac-Man nut, you'll get your fill after a short while and be left wondering where your money went.   But not this time. Skip over Pac-Man on the 3DS VC and save your cash for some better, more original Game Boy classics.", "date": "Aug 9, 2006"}
