Smart thinking indeed, for any Mega Man game is likely a good one, as PlayStation enthusiasts can no doubt attest. And Mega Man 64 seems to have all the makings of a hit. First and foremost, it stars everyone's favorite cartoon-ized hero complete with 3D makeover. But more importantly, there is adventure to be had, puzzles to be solved and, in traditional form, many, many enemies to be blown to bits. The only problem is that all of these goodies were delivered to PlayStation owners three years ago in the same game -- and even then it wasn't all that impressive. By today's standards, as we approach the end of the Nintendo 64 and the beginning of GameCube, this drab port of Mega Man Legends is nothing, if not laughably outdated.  The Facts   Mega Man Legends as a N64 game 3D Engine (sort of) Action and RPG-like elements Controllable camera system Inventory and weapons   Gameplay Mega Man 64, for those of you still unaware, is actually Mega Man Legends for PlayStation in disguise. Unfortunately for Capcom, it is not skilled in the ways of trickery, and though it valiantly attempted to fool us with the omission of 'Legends' and addition of '64' to the title, once we played the game we realized what it is; a port, if you're curious. Nothing less, and surely nothing more.  Mega Man 64, like its three-year old grandfather, breaks from the traditional 2D side-scrolling action the series has come to be known for over the years. In 1998, when the PlayStation game was released, this was an exciting development. Mega Man Legends employed a shoddy 3D engine by which the gun-touting hero could explore nakedly decorated environments, interact with low polygon characters, traverse endless 3D mazes and eventually fight the obligatory boss character. All the while, Mega Man could increase his own strength and performance by collecting items and completing side-quests. The Nintendo 64 version of the game is identical, still hampered by the same flaws and lack of design experience that detracted from the original. Included the in the impressive list of shortcomings, a clumsy, digital control scheme, a poorly executed, disorienting camera system that seemingly works oppositely of Mega Man's ideal view at all times, and a repetition of the same quality fights, character interactions and levels. It is, simply put, a first-generation 3D adventure regurgitated for all Nintendo 64 owners to blindly consume, as if a new title makes it a fresh product.  The fact is that if you buy Mega Man 64, you're really buying the old PlayStation game and nothing more. If you can live with that, or if you liked the explore-and-shoot mechanics of the offering, or are just an all around Mega Man fanatic, there could very well still be a droplet or two of appeal left. Otherwise, though, turn your head away in disgust and wait for Capcom to give us a little something more on GameCube.  Graphics Well, here we are -- three years later and very few visual changes to speak of. Capcom did Nintendo 64 owners the great favor of implementing some filtering over the edgy, texture-warped graphics of the original PlayStation game, but Mega Man 64 still looks barren and blurry with very little variation in 3D environments to speak of. Mega Man and enemy characters animate well enough, the look is reminiscent of the 2D games, and there is the occasionally detailed boss character, sure. But even so, the draw distance is crap and the framerate still somehow suffers even though nothing is really going on in the title to cause such a stir. Spice it all up with the limitations of the dusty 3D engine, which clips and claps through every wall, obliterating any real sense of a gameplay world. Are we to be impressed? Maybe at the dawn of 3D graphics, but not by today's standards.  Sound You know, if you've read through the review thus far and still your consideration hinges on the balance of sound, you are not a sound person. There is nothing in the game that will tempt the ears, or keep the mind interested by way of. Let's leave it at that so that we don't waste anymore time filling space for a product that obviously has no real business in your gaming library. Mega Man Legends was a poor experience for PlayStation, so one has to wonder why Capcom has decided to make Nintendo 64 owners suffer through it unchanged? Whatever evil reasoning the company had for the infliction, don't be tricked by its calculated title change. There is nothing new in this game that wasn't in its PlayStation predecessor. But it does feature all of the same flaws, right down to a disjointed camera system, insulting control scheme, naked graphics and poorly mixed elements from the action and RPG genres.Unless you are, in fact, Mega Man, or believe yourself to be the biggest advocate of the franchise, there is no reason at all to even bother with renting this game, let alone buying it. Please, do us the great favor of waiting for something better on GameCube.", "date": "Jan 30, 2001"}
