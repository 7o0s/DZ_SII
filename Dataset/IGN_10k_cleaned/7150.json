John is tasked with battling an alien invasion in NY after his squad gets wiped out. It's never explained why this random medical student is at the center of this disaster, and he offers no opinion as to what's going on. But before you know it you're blasting those aliens back to . . . well, wherever they came from. This game doesn't really have a story. The aliens remain a mystery on nearly all levels. It's only clear that NY has been invaded by vicious, faceless aliens, and it's your job to blow 'em to bits.    After a quick introductory session good only for demonstrating the inept squad AI and borrowed War of the Worlds designs, the player takes charge of Armstrong for an intro to controls, and a bit of aimless wandering.    Soon enough you're blasting aliens with a wide array of weapons - most of which are relatively inconsequential. There are many levels in this game and while some of them may warrant the use of the zoom on the sniper rifle, it's easy to get by with nearly exclusive use of the M4. You can also upgrade weapons with vials of goo dropped by enemies called ~Biomatter~. It's basic, but it works. The gunplay lacks depth, and is as simple as  pointing and shooting.    It's also worth noting the game's use of heavy scripting. It's easy to predict when and where things are going to pop out so gameplay becomes a chore - there's no real strategy and the AI is practically non-existent. The aliens will fire at you blindly, charge, and in what I'm guessing is some semblance of an evasion move, they'll do a little shuffle step. The animations are so stiff it looks more like they're doing the Thriller dance than any natural motion.    The game's missions include poorly presented objectives which are irrelevant, in any case, as the game only requires blasting a way through the poorly designed levels. That's essentially Terra Wars in a nutshell. Each room has scripted spawn points which pop out new spawns in waves.  Planning for subsequent waves is as simple as making note of where the first one spawned. Just set up camp and voila - an alien appears just begging to be destroyed. The game's linearity is extreme enough that levels are filled with invisible barriers which paint an awkwardly clear path.   Most gameplay elements peripheral to the straight running and gunning are implemented with little or no thought whatsoever. I'm not too sure what it is about some developers these days that compel them to include platforming in first person shooters. It doesn't work well, as you can't see your feet. Yet there is a good amount of it present in the game's level design, and these sequences serve more to frustrate than anything else. Some stages require you escort allies, but these NPCs are nigh invulnerable, so there's never a sense of urgency to protect them. They also serve as another way to highlight how linear Terra Wars is, as your allies simply move along through a scripted path, and then abruptly stop so mobs can spawn and assault you. You can't proceed ahead and satisfy the objectives, nor should you feel pressured to keep up with your mark as he won't spawn the mobs until you get near.    There's no fear of being low on health, armor, or ammo in Terra Wars either. The game also boasts power-ups of standard fare, including ammo, health, armor and vials that upgrade your maximum health and stamina. These power-ups are abundant and the contents of the ammo packs are excessive. 686 ammo from one container is overboard. It's not unusual to find 1000 ammo in your assault rifle. In a game so far from realistic, it's curious why they decided to toss in a feature like depleting stamina. When it's gone, all you can do is sluggishly move about - or stand around and wait for it to regenerate, which takes an awfully long time. But it gives you a moment to consider why you're playing this game in the first place.      Ladyluck Digital claims Terra Wars ~runs well on diverse PC configurations,~ and it shows. This isn't due to the game being well optimized, it simply uses an engine that is several years old: the LithTech Jupiter engine. You know, the engine that powered No One Lives Forever 2?  While NOLF2 is pretty dated, it used the Jupiter engine effectively and looked quite nice for its time. Several years later, Terra Wars comes along and uses the same dated engine with entirely no imagination.  The NPC models are repetitive and boring. Weapons aren't much better. The levels are almost completely bare with simple textures, overused assets, and tons of clipping. They couldn't even get the flashlight right, it just points at the floor. Early on, the draw distance is too far, exposing the ugly backgrounds of the more open zones, as well as the low quality buildings and objects in the distance. It seems they later realized how ugly their game was and covered the distance in a somewhat dense red fog. The aliens are unmistakably inspired by Halo's Covenant. There aren't many varieties of the aliens either, maybe 3-4 different models total, with some differences in coloration. Overall, Terra Wars looks like an amateurish total conversion mod of No One Lives Forever 2, and even the icons for power-ups like armor and ammo are reused from that game.    Unsurprisingly, sound fares no better. There is absolutely no music to speak of in this game, which could be a blessing in disguise, as the rest of the audio is horrendous. There aren't many sound effects in the game, and many are reused. Slashing a window with your knife, for example, sounds like you hit a cardboard box. Voice acting is also abysmal. The actors lack timing and simply read off their lines at about a mile a minute. The vocal work sounds forced and campy in both the writing and the delivery.   There's also multiplayer! Yep, that basically sums that part up. It's implemented as an afterthought and nothing more. There's one map, and the game offers co-op play. Good luck finding a server though, I sure couldn't.Terra Wars is simply the latest addition to the horde of generic first person shooters available on the market today. While budget titles fill a certain role, you just dont get what you pay for with this game. Terra Wars is atrocious across the board, and simply not worth shelling out the money for, even if it is budget priced. Your money would be better spent elsewhere. There's absolutely no reason to invade your local gaming store for this one, it's a stinker.", "date": "Aug 23, 2006"}
