The game (released in Europe for quite some time and finally released in North America) is centered around a galactic struggle with a mechanized race known as the Dominators which showed up out of nowhere to give the five main galactic races a pounding. The Space Rangers are the first line of defense against these invaders and are pretty much an autonomous organization built as military and trade support. Players will need to climb up the Ranger ranks, gain new equipment, kill lots of dominators, help research thrive, and eventually take out the three main Dominator command units. How that happens is very open for interpretation.   Players begin as meager entries into the ranks of the Rangers and work their way up in notoriety, riches, and strength. How that happens is really up to the players. Money and experience are gained through quests and actions against the Dominators and can be used to increase character stats and improve ships and equipment.    There are definitely some comparisons that can be drawn to Star Control for its fixed top down camera, but it's actually got much more like Freelancer mixed with some turn-based mechanics. Movement is based on turns that last one solar day so depending on a ship's speed, it can move a certain distance in one day. These turns can be taken without having to give orders constantly for travel and combat which makes it a bit more bearable. Movement will default to constant travel (until an event like combat or conversation breaks up the movement) and double clicking on an enemy ship will enter automatic combat mode. It's also easy to make decisions in combat by switching the game to turn-based mode with the press of a button.   The galaxy is huge with 18 sectors of space comprised of three or four star systems each. All of those star systems have different numbers of planets to go along with space stations (scientific, economic, military, and medical) that can be built with the help of donations and then destroyed by the Dominators when they invade a system. The random generation of the galaxy at the beginning of the game only adds to the replayability.   All of the planets and stations serve functions aside from being simple objects floating through space. Stations can generate new military vessels to invade enemy controlled systems, provide research and more powerful weapons, cure diseases, and most importantly, provide quests. There are a ton of quests that are pretty varied. Most missions given will have to do with the space based portion of the game. Delivery, seek and destroy, and protection missions are many and give players the opportunity to see all corners of the galaxy.   Text based missions can be ~choose your own adventure~ mini-games or puzzles that vary in difficulty, fun, and comprehension. Unfortunately, the translation from Russian is bad enough in parts that it can be hard to understand and follow the clues correctly. There was also at least one of these missions that actually had the wrong text in the wrong place making it a matter of trial and error to finish the mission. These are a happy distraction, but I've been pretty thankful that I can simply dismiss these missions and get a different option when they appear. You never know what you're going to get with these and the quality varies pretty widely.   Occasionally, planet governments hand out missions that move the action to the planet and into RTS mode to battle it out with Dominators that have landed somewhere in the system. All units on the battlefield are robots with interchangeable parts (chassis, weapons, accessories, treads or legs) that add expense and both attack and defense properties to the unit. Each side on the field (there usually are four, but I've seen as few as two) must eliminate the other players by securing resource nodes and eventually sending a robot into an enemy base to capture it. The challenge simply comes from deciding what pieces to put on which robots. For the most part, I've found it's pretty successful to stay with one type of robot and be methodical about taking over the world. The computer is aggressive, but pretty damn stupid. This is pretty damn simple compared to your average RTS, but it's still fun to get out of space and into other gameplay elements from time to time. Those that want nothing to do with this mode (which actually drops the game into full 3D) can choose to skip the missions or simply not install them at all.    I've heard that there are some other special missions in the make-up of Space Rangers 2 such as a mini-game that challenges players to manage a ski resort, but I haven't run across it at this point. But just the thought of it is intriguing and fun if a bit perplexing. It's great to add a lot of content and fun moments, but at some point, there has to be a bit more focus. It seems like more time could have been spent on a little more polish to the core gameplay elements and interface instead. For example, a central hub for jobs would have been very nice so that it wouldn't be necessary to fly back and forth between planets in order to find missions (planet governments don't always have something to offer). It would be more efficient and allow players to choose exactly what they want to do and get in the action without having to run around searching for it. What employer just sits and waits around for someone to come asking for a job anyway? Jobs are up on job boards or employment sites.   In any case, players can also choose to stay away from quests by becoming pirates and attacking any nearby vessels to gain money and infamy. It is important to be careful about who you piss off though. All planets and races have faction levels and will eventually end up attacking on sight.   All the while, it's important to keep an eye on systems around the galaxy to help defend against Dominator attacks and participate in assaults into Dominator controlled space. Collecting Dominator parts from destroyed ships and turning them into science stations will eventually help researchers find the solution to destroying the enemy once and for all.    One clue that the game provides to what system might be attacked next is the appearance of a black hole. It'll show up on the galaxy map so when deciding where to travel next, you'll be able to see where you might want to head next. Black holes don't always mean Dominator attacks however and actually provide access to yet another mini-game. Flying into a black hole brings up another nice action distraction. In this mode, players fight against enemy Dominators inside of black hole space using the arrow keys and ctrl to fire in an action environment. One weapon can be fired at a time and power-ups can be found around each of these small levels. These are definitely a welcome change from the normal gameplay and provide a hell of a challenge in later portions of the game.  Open-ended gameplay can be a double-edged sword. It's awesome because it lets the player pretty much do anything they want whenever they want, but it's not awesome because it often offers no direction to players at any time. Space Rangers 2 might as well be the double edged sword. It provides an amazing amount of freedom for players to explore, trade, fight, complete quests and more. But it could definitely stand from a little more structure to move players in the right direction. It's fiction without story to progress gameplay every now and again, exploration, and combat with an end but an end so far away that it's only a pinprick of light at the end of a very long tunnel.There's so much in this game to like that I really wish there had been some cohesive plot or progression to lock more of it together with the option for players to explore and gain experience along the lines of Freelancer. Even simple signposts suggesting that you're doing the right thing would have been nice.Be that as it may, there really is a ton to do here. There are a lot of varied mission types and extra gameplay outside of the core experience and it becomes really addictive to get that next great ship to become more powerful. This is a fun game that deserves some recognition even though it has some flaws.", "date": "Mar 30, 2006"}
