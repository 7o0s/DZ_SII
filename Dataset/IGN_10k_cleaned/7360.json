It all sounds like so much hot air, but there must be something to it. How would all those flashy agencies and consultancies keep themselves in skinny lattes otherwise? Obviously advertising works, up to a point, but are we as consumers so utterly incapable of making our choices without an army of sharp-suited, buzz-word spewing men and women beavering around behind the scenes on our behalf? Sadly it seems we cannot be trusted with our own money and common sense. Marketing is there to help you make correct and informed decisions in a dangerous world of temptation-laden high street retailers.   Or is it? The name of Championship Manager became an institution, building and refining over years a series that sat proudly and untouchably at the pinnacle of its genre. When Sports Interactive bed-hopped to SEGA it took its game with it, leaving behind nothing more than a grand old marquee. Luckily, I'm the right kind of guy to lead you through the minefield of marketing skullduggery. When I go to the pub and fancy a drop of cider I don't pay top dollar for a trendy Magner's, I go for a pint of Strongbow. My consumer decision is made thus - more cider for less money. So don't worry, you're in safe hands.    This is the second Championship Manager game to appear without Sports Interactive's involvement and it still looks like Championship Manager. Sort of. The screen layout, news service, squad and tactics screens, player information and searches all follow the same basic blueprint. Visually, though, it's not quite as attractive. The screens always seem empty and bland, no matter how many of those all important stats are displayed, giving it a lightweight, almost unfinished feel. Thoughtfully, Eidos has included a few different game skins, although these don't really rectify the problem.   Following in the footsteps of the recent LMA update, CM 2007 is the second recent contender for Football Manager's crown. Although afflicted with some chronic fundamental flaws, LMA approached the subject matter in a slightly different way, opting for a more visual approach thanks to its natty 3D match engine and nicely rendered stadiums. CM, on the other hand, follows the old Champ Man format - comprised of stats and menu screens - very closely, albeit nowhere near as well.    The homepage, which you'll spend most of your time viewing, displays your squad with at-a-glance-icons indicating injuries, player happiness, where they're under the scrutiny of other clubs, in need of a rest and so on. From here you can click on anyone to bring up their stats screen and get more details on their fitness, morale and frame of mind. If they have issues these are displayed on their status screen and can be addressed by talking to the player. This could mean offering reassurances about their role at the club, explaining why they aren't in the first team or promising to open contract negotiations. Keeping them happy will hopefully lead to improved performances on the pitch. All this information is easy to get at with navigation tabs across the top of the screen and a handy 'home' icon top left which instantly returns you to the squad screen.   Tactics are just as simple to play around with. A menu gives you a comprehensive list of preset formations and strategies to choose from, plus you can tweak any of them to your heart's content by dragging the shirts to new positions and setting priorities for areas to run into or pass the ball. All very intuitive.   Additionally there are a couple of significant new features for 2007: team talks are used to get your boys up before a game, offer praise or encouragement at halftime and to let them know how they performed after the final whistle. You can conduct talks collectively as a team or individually with each player via pull down menus, which give you different options - be it an arm round the shoulder or a spot of teacup chucking. However, it's hard to see what difference these actually make. Having spent the first half of the season haranguing the lads to win or lose every single game, then encouraging and praising them to high heaven for the remainder of the campaign, there was no discernable up or downturn in results. You do have to be careful with individuals though. Praise someone up when they've played rubbish and they get confused, or angry if you give them a rollicking when they did well.   The big deal though is that the game now features the ProZone performance analysis tool as used by various premiership managers. It enables you to dissect every element of each individual player's performance throughout a game and hopefully figure out exactly where they need to improve right down to the minutest detail. The real thing can process data every tenth of a second but thankfully this has been simplified down to more manageable 15 minute portions. However you'd still have to be pretty dedicated to get into it in any detail. What you really want to be doing is wheeling and dealing and getting the hell on with things. Still, it's there if you want to take advantage of it.   Championship Manager's big problem is it looks and feels exactly like what it is - a pale imitation of its previous self. It does almost everything Football Manager does, but without a lot of the depth and care and attention SI lavishes on its title. In fact it's like the developer has gone down a checklist of all the things a Champ Manager game needs, but forgot to add the soul. It doesn't feel like a labour of love which it so obviously was before. For all its faults, at least LMA offers a markedly different take on things. This is too similar to Football Manager to make any distinction, except that it's not as good. It's further let down by poor attention to detail like, for example, the news stories that come through saying you're on a good run of form when you've quite clearly lost two or three games on the spin. Anomalies are to be expected now and then but they're too frequent here to ignore.The introduction of the ProZone angle gives seriously hardcore players more than enough data to chew on and further expands a game which already boasts plenty of scope. What it doesnt offer is feel or personality. Its all too by-the-numbers and occasionally careless. Championship Manager followers will be well aware that this is Championship Manager in name only, but even newcomers will notice how basically ugly it is. A brand is a brand, but Eidos wont fool too many people with this.", "date": "Oct 12, 2006"}
