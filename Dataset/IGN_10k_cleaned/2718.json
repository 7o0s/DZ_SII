Gameplay, gameplay, gameplay, but not much variety. Don't get me wrong, I haven't stopped playing it since it was installed on my G4, but after a while the game leaves you wanting for more.   The game is broken down into tiers, the four level unit that divides Quake III Arena's 24 levels down into six groups that loosely reflect difficulty. Each tier will has three general purpose deathmatch levels and a final one on one level where the player fights a Boss deathmatch. Each level has a fixed number of bots that is based on the size of the level. As your ranking increases, the levels become more difficult. The number of bots stay the same, but they become much more difficult to kill. Quake III Arena also has eight Capture the Flag specific levels for team play, as well as team deathmatching.   The bots themselves are very difficult to kill. Bots can hear the sound of a powerup being picked up and have a random chance of realizing where that power up is. Bots also rocket jump. They won't go hopping around the level to pick up ammo, but you can bet that they'll jump for the mega health or red armor.   To keep the game fair to human players, bots don't know which other players are human or computer controlled and will take any kills they can get. Like real players, bots taunt and respond to your taunting.   With a game so heavily focused on deathmatching, individualizing your character is very important and Id has thoughtfully offered a massive roster of models and skins. The relative size of the models don't have any affect on their target profile, however. A small woman model or a large cyborg occupy the same virtual amount of space and are no easier, or more difficult, to hit. The models also have unique sounds to round out their character.   Graphically, Q3A is the king of the hill. No other game can match the shear visual quality of this game, especially running on one of the new G4 systems with the Rage 128 Pro chip. Q3A runs in native 32 bit color and makes full use of the additional color range. Textures are rich and highly detailed, effects like glows and light mapping are breath taking, and effects like rocket contrails are as gossamer as smoke. The game still looks good on a 3dfx card, but it really delivers on an ATI card.   The days of big square rooms with blocky corridors are gone, but even the awe inspiring levels that are included with the game become very mundane after the 50th time you've played them. The game also includes only deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag modes. While these modes are good, they're hardly all encompassing. Id was obviously counting on the legions of Mod makers to offer other game types like last man standing. I'm sure that those Mod makers will come through for us, in fact many already are, but the fact that there are no map making tools available to Mac users doesn't sit so well when you consider there are only a grand total of 32 levels that ship with the game.   That said, when you reach the space levels for the first time you are going to say ~Oh My God, that is so cool.~   Another problem with Q3A is the raw horse power that it demands to play even reasonably well. Forget about playing the game if you don't have a G3 or better processor and a Rage 128 or better video card. I'm sorry iMac owners, if you're running with a Rage Pro chip, don't buy this game. You will be really disappointed. Even if you turn off a lot of the settings that make Quake look so good, frame rates tend to dip dramatically when there are a number of players on screen at once, all hurling rockets at you. If you have plenty of RAM to give Q3A, that can improve your performance quite a bit. I'd suggest at least 110 Megs free for the game.   Complaints aside, Quake 3 Arena is truly a masterpiece. Where Id failed to deliver in the variety category, it has made up for in many others. Take the Physics, for example. Q3 just feels right. Players look like they're running at the correct speed. If you fire a rocket into an oncoming opponent's feet, assuming they have enough health and armor not to explode into bloody chuncks on impact, they'll be blown into the air where you can nail them a second time as they flounder for footing. On the space levels, if you get knocked off a platform by a railgun or rocket, you really feel like you're falling.   Id also got the weapons right. They aren't too inspired in terms of originality, but they do exactly what you want. With one exception, all the weapons in the game are exceedingly well balanced. The shotgun is great close up, but crappy over distance. The railgun is still pretty much a one shot kill, but not if someone has just spawned. The rocket launcher is just powerful enough that it is a challenging weapon to master. The new BFG, on the other hand, is like a machine gun rocket launcher. Pick that baby up and you can pretty much guarantee dominance until you run out of ammo.   To keep things interesting, Id also threw in some powerups, including the all too familiar Quad damage, as well as Mega health, Regeneration, Flight and Invisibility.   The bottom line with Quake 3 Arena is that Id has delivered an incredibly addicting game. Id set out with one goal in mind: Create the ultimate deathmatch, and they have pretty much succeeded. If you're looking for more than deathmatching, you won't really find it until Quake fans start churning out modifications for the game, but until then, what a deathmatch it is!", "date": "Jun 10, 2002"}
