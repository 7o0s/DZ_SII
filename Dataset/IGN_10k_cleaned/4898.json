The brand is about to receive another boost in visibility, thanks to the release of CBS Sportsline Track & Field, timed perfectly to the upcoming Olympics. Sure to receive higher placement on the decks, does CBS Sportsline Track & Field deserve a download?   Features:   Seven events  Represent different countries   CBS Sportsline Track & Field is one of the better track games out this summer to capitalize on the Olympics. The presentation even includes a lighting of the torch ceremony in the beginning -- too bad it's against a rather plain background. No shadow of the Acropolis here -- perhaps Sony has the Grecian skyline all licensed up with their Athens 2004 game?   There are seven events to compete in: 100m dash, high jump, hurdles, long jump, shot put, discus and javelin. While it's not the full ten, this is certainly a better selection than several other summer games titles are offering.   The event control just as you would expect from a track game. Employing the rapid button press technique of old-school Track & Field (arcade, not Upstart Games' handset edition), players jam on the number pad to achieve record speeds. While this certainly works -- and works well -- it does raise a question. Do you want all that wear and tear on your handset? You may have gotten your current model free in a contract deal, but chances are your manufacturer won't replace it just because you wanted the gold in hurdles.   Our favorite events include shot put and discus. You use the ~6~ button in these events to generate power, then use the ~4~ to determine the angle. The system feels very precise, so you constantly think you could do better on the next try by tweaking your angle and jamming just a little bit harder on ~6.~ There is much more replay value in these two events (and javelin) than running or hurdles.   CBS Sportsline Track & Field looks pretty good. It doesn't have the sleekness of Sorrent's game, nor the cartoon endearment of Dan Parks Decathlon, but the interface is clean and the in-game athletes are decently sized and animated. We would have enjoyed just a little more detail. The sound is also well done, playing good background music during down times.  CBS Sportsline Track & Field is a good track and field game for summer players that want a little Olympic magic in their pockets. The control is slightly better than Dan Parks, but it just doesn't have the visual panache we were hoping to go along with it. At least it has more events than other contenders, which goes a long way toward getting the gold, too.", "date": "Aug 12, 2004"}
