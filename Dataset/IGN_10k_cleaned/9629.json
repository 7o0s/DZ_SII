Then replace Ganon with the Sheriff of Nottingham and you have Robin Hood for mobile, a top-down adventure game that shares more in common with Nintendo's great epic series than a hero that struts his stuff in tights. Spend some time with what looks like a blatant, boring knock-off, though, and you'll discover than even blatant knock-offs can still have a little charm.   Robin Hood is a retelling of the classic narrative, no doubt one you're familiar with -- the thief has been portrayed some real greats of the silver screen: Errol Flynn, Kevin Costner, and Bugs Bunny. Global Fun breaks down Robin of Locksley's tale into twelve chapters full of exploration and one-button combat. When Robin arrives home from the Crusades, he discovers that the lands he once called home have been sacked by the horrible Prince John and the aforementioned sheriff. Robin must push across the countryside to settle score, meet up with comrades, and eventually restore order.   Now, check out the screens below for Robin Hood. If you've been gaming for a decent length of time, you'll immediately see the allusions to the Legend of Zelda. Robin runs around the overworld, dips into dungeons, and talks up people to get information on what to do next. There is plenty of colored key and chest puzzle work, as well as side errands that aren't exactly part of the main story, but definitely help bolster Robin's good-guy image.   Combat in Robin Hood is as simple as running up to an enemy and pressing the OK button to strike with a sword. Then you pull back to avoid a counterstrike before rushing close to deliver the next blow. Once Robin has his bow and arrows, he can target enemies from a distance. A little target system helps manage multiple enemies, such as soldiers. To move the target, look at the next enemy you want to target and press OK to let fly with an arrow. Robin earns new arrows over the course of the game, such as fire arrows.   It's not exactly the deepest adventure on mobile, but it's not without fun. The Zelda formula may not be entirely original, but it's still completely functional. The world and enemies designs are bright and colorful, full of great detail. I could see a decent player getting a couple hours out of this game.  Even though Robin Hood breaks zero new ground, I still enjoyed my time with it. It cashes in on some pretty hoary conventions like colored keys and doors, but video games as a whole still traffic in these staples, so it's a little unfair to pick on Robin Hood for following along. If you want a top-down adventure in the Zelda vein for your handset, Robin Hood will provide a couple hours of entertainment. Just don't expect it to steal your heart.", "date": "Nov 27, 2007"}
