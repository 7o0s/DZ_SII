A male, its glorious mane shines golden in the -- BANG!   It's dead.   As the mighty grizzly and the mythological Yeti before it, the lion so too has fallen prey to the mighty virtual hunter, sponsored by Cabela's, the world's foremost outfitter of hunting, fishing and outdoor gear, as well as mediocre hunting videogames.    In a cruel twist of fate, we have yet to enjoy one new Halo game on the Xbox 360 while the console is somehow blessed with two Cabela's hunting games: Cabela's Alaskan Adventures and now, Cabela's African Safari. Say what you want about this maligned franchise, but Activision keeps making the games and, by golly, you keep buying them.     King of the jungle? See for yourself.   Looking back at the virtual hunting genre, it's clear that a great hunting game has yet to penetrate the mass-market. That's because the last great hunting game was Duck Hunt. For whatever reason, issuing bird calls and following animal tracks are not nearly as fun as they sound -- big reasons why hunting sims continually flounder. On one hand, it's difficult to capture all the hours spent waiting and tracking, angling for that perfect shot on a trophy prize. Plus, that's boring. Then again, can you really call it hunting if all you do is grab a gun and start shooting? I guess so, because that's the name of the game in Cabela's African Safari.    African Safari is a streamlined hunting experience, a nice of way of saying ~hunting-light.~ There's no in-game currency, no real tracking, no hunter stamina and no real planning whatsoever. Simply select an animal to hunt, pick a gun and go. While this approach shortens African Safari considerably in comparison to other Cabela's titles, it makes for a more accessible and enjoyable hunting experience. But it still could use a lot of work.    How can you miss? The major mode is Safari Hunt, in which you travel to South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and finally Tanzania. Along the way you'll bag a number of trophies, including zebra, geese, turtle doves, leopards, hippos, elephants, crocs and mighty rhinos. We're fairly certain a number of the 40 exotic species also make appearances on the endangered species list, but that's part of what makes this game so politically incorrect. Aside from the typical PETA complaints (broken records, we say), the game also lets you take control of four different white male hunters to be escorted across Southern Africa by Black guides that chauffeur you about in a Jeep and a boat. The only thing that could make the game any more reprehensible is if the guides served you Mai Tais in the lodge.   A bunch of zebras are about to pay for their insolence. But true hunters care not for these things. True hunters care for sprinting through the plains with a scoped .44 handgun chasing after leopards. In Safari Hunt, you choose an animal to hunt that day. There are a few different types of missions -- duck hunting with shotguns from a boat, shooting at a herd of zebra from the back of a Jeep, tracking missions and straightforward hunting. On the novice difficulty, you can see animals' locations on your radar, as well as their area of vision. If you cross that line, you'll startle the animals and they'll scamper about, or, if they are so inclined, they may attack you. Luckily, you can slow things down with ~Bullet Time,~ and pop a cap in a charging rhino before it gets to you. Novice is as easy as it comes and it takes only a few hours to trudge through the entire game.      On experienced difficulty, you no longer can see the animals' area of vision, so if you see a blip on the radar you need to crouch and sneak around them. Your amount of bullet time is decreased, so you can only squeeze out a single shot. On the hardest difficulty, you have a smidgen of bullet time and no radar. Hunting animals is a tedious exercise in running around the map, hoping to spot one. The major problem here is that if you spook the smaller animals that you have little chance of spotting in the brush, they scamper about and you probably won't see them again. But if you crouch and sneak around the entire time, you have little chance of finding your prey before the mission timer runs out. In a word: lame. Experienced is the only reasonably-balanced difficulty level.    Tracking missions are especially laughable as instead of following tracks, you follow red bugs that tell you where tracks are supposed to be. After you find five groups of bugs, your prey will magically appear, oblivious to you and your superb tracking skills. This is probably the best example how the real-life hunting elements have been toned down.    Damn birds. The weapon selection is vast, but the different caliber shotguns, rifles and handguns do not feel any different than other guns in the same category. During each mission, you can talk to the porter, a cheeky American, for advice on the proper gun for the prey of the day. These guns are powerful enough to take down the target, but not so powerful that they explode, ruining the trophy.   After a number of missions in each region, you take on one of the dangerous seven, a ~boss battle~ of sorts against a lion, hippo or other equally fearsome creature. But these battles are also easy and lack the drama that should come with, say, bagging an elephant.   There is a downloadable mission available on Xbox Live that features a small cat called the Caracal. While dangerous in the wild, these cats are also easily tamed and the big-eared creatures are actually used as pets, even here in the United States. So fight the caracal at your own choosing -- it costs 140 Microsoft Points and the fight is repetitive as the rest.   The hyena laughs at your demise. There is no online play, which is a shame because hunter duels would add a lot of excitement to this game. What's more, imagine if you could control a lion and attack (or flee) from your friend, playing as the hunter? Instead, we are left with a few superfluous game modes that simply replay the same missions from the Safari Hunt.    Visually, African Safari does a few things well, especially with the massive herds rumbling across the plains. But mostly, the game looks like an upscaled PlayStation 2 game with bland environments. The sound features the dialogue of the aforementioned guide, using a laughable and somewhat degrading accent, while music is minimal. The ambient noise is well-done, par for the course with Cabela's, but every now and then you shoot an animal like a little duiker and it lets out a rhinoceros roar. Cabela's African Safari is a streamlined version of past titles that is far more accessible to the average player. While this may irk long-time fans, the lack of bird calls and any significant hunting -- other than shooting -- is enough to keep you interested for a few hours. Unfortunately, the game is still about running around somewhat aimlessly, looking for animals, and shooting them. While the campy nature of African Safari is good for a few laughs, they are at the game's own expense. Hunting fans will have to wait yet again for the next -- and first -- great hunting game.", "date": "Apr 6, 2007"}
