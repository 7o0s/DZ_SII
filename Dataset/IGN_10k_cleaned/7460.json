Someone seems to think that an action packed cartoon is best translated to the Gameboy Advance in the form of top down role playing games. It happened to Dragonball Z, and now it's happened to Avatar. And while Halfbrick Studios made a semi-enjoyable experience for the handheld, it certainly doesn't feel like the show it's based on.    For all the Avatar games, the same basic story was chosen, though it plays out a little differently on the GBA than it does on the Nintendo DS or the consoles. Aang and friends are investigating the disappearance of a Waterbender, and along the way discover other Benders are being kidnapped. The same basic plot points are there, just with a slightly different path. For the GBA version, that path is one of very little storytelling. There's plenty of dialogue between the main characters, and the faces in the text boxes have a fairly decent speaking animation, but the conversations feel lifeless. There's none of the humor, or conversational quality that the other games, or show, offer. None of the characters really seem in character, and for a game that is based on such a popular license, that's a huge mistake.    For a GBA game, Avatar has a nice feel. The top down view of the game manages to work nicely. The characters are slow, but everything is fluid and well animated. There are a lot of nice environmental effects in the game, such as the rainy docks early on. Lighting from candles and lanterns flicker and sunlight pours into rooms from open windows. The characters powers are all well animated and look like what they're representing. The fire powers sizzle and crackle, the water splashes, the rocks crumble and crack.    Aang, Katara, and Sokka are all controlled as a group, and players can switch between them by holding the shoulder buttons. They all have their strengths, and each one is an invaluable member to the team. Aang can fly up onto ledges, Katara can make bridges, and Sokka can use his boomerang to activate switches. Since the game consists of a large amount of puzzle, players will have to become familiar with the abilities of the characters. The developers do a good job of balancing the puzzles. I was a little wary of all the box puzzles, but the design manages to be unique and different each time, so the gameplay never gets stale. A map feature of some sort would have been nice though, since a lot of the levels are fairly large, and players can't see too far ahead of their characters. People in the game will tell you to talk to someone, and then never tell players where that person is. Only by wandering around and talking to other random strangers can players figure out where they should go, and that's just a waste of time.       With a slower pace and so many puzzles, Avatar seems like a great puzzle role playing game. However, since it is based on an action cartoon, it's only natural that the developers try to stick in plenty of that as well. Unfortunately, it doesn't come off as well. Battles play out awkwardly, especially for the ones that require players to switch characters to defeat opponents. The pace of the battles is hindered by a chi meter that limits how often players can attack. So instead of a simple hack and slash disposal of an enemy, players are forced to engage in a drawn out fights. On the same token, the boss battles don't really match the rest of the game. After crawling through dozens of dungeon rooms, players are thrown into an uncharacteristically fast paced boss battle that requires constant movement. The battles would be fine, if the other fights in the game followed the same style, but they don't. The normal battles are slow, and most of the game consists of puzzles, so the boss battles stick out like a sore thumb. Avatar feels like it's trying to be two different games at once, and that detracts from the experience.    It's never a big surprise to hear that a GBA game has mediocre sound. Avatar suffers from the short, repetitive soundtrack syndrome. The songs are not bad really, but there are only so many times I can listen to it before I start to go insane. There's no voicework in the game either, so there's really no reason to turn the volume up.   When it comes to Avatar: The Last Airbender as a video game, players have a lot of choices. The game came out on every major console, and is even coming out for the Wii. For players that are looking for that Avatar experience, go try the Nintendo DS version. This game is kind of fun, but it certainly isn't the Avatar that so many people adore.", "date": "Oct 27, 2006"}
