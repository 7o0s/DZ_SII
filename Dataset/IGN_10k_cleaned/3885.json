Even the smallest, unhealthiest little water-breather was enough of a trophy for me when it came to my amateur angling. That's why it came as such a shock that Capcom's Pro Cast Sports Fishing was so small and unhealthy in the areas of gameplay, graphics, sound, presentation and lasting appeal. If ever an Xbox game like this showed up on a hook at the end of my line, I think I would've actually done the improbable and thrown it back.  Gameplay In Pro Cast you're given the basic elements we've come to expect from fishing games like picking the right location to cast and picking the right lure for the time of day and weather conditions. You've got your basic free fishing mode, an arcade mode that presents you with a series of tournaments and the simulation mode where you're angling competitively and earning points, prizes and new tackle. The game is certainly easy access because the controls are basic as well with the right trigger reeling in and the left analog stick controlling your rod. Pro cast runs into problems because the game is so basic and accessible that you're quickly bored with the routine of casting, not seeing any fish, reeling in and recasting somewhere else. Your common sense as a fisherman and the game's manual tell you directly to always cast near structures and to a logical depth if you want to reel 'em in one after the other. Too often however you come up empty in Pro Cast for no good reason. You can have the perfect casting motion, in the perfect location with the perfect lure and make that sucker dance the perfect pattern and you still end up with nothing. This happens far too often for a fishing videogame.   In the real world, the frustration of a consistently empty hook is doused by the sweet nurturing tides of alcohol that are as much a part of fishing as the fresh water itself. If golf is nothing more than a great way to ruin a nice walk, then fishing is nothing more than a great way to consume beer in absolute peace and quiet. In this instance Pro Cast is right on the money and could be commended for being the most realistic fishing sim ever because you will need plenty of drinking to get any fun out of this bad boy.   There are only a handful of playable characters --including one named Jill who looks a lot like the Resident Evil hero-- and a minimal amount of lures and rods to unlock throughout the game. The fishing category on Xbox is extremely thin (you're reading about the only one right now) and that's a shame. But there's no excuse for the dearth of fun Pro Cast Sports Fishing has to offer.  Graphics If you're going to have a slow moving fishing game that does little more than show underwater scenes of fish not biting on your hook, then it should be absolutely gorgeous. This game is not.  The fish are decently drawn but the murky green water keeps everything with same sort of drab look. When it goes slack, the test line you're using does bend and flow with soft curves, but instead it bends in sections like a blind person's cane when it's broken down. There isn't much animation required for the dancing and zigzagging of the lures but we're nonetheless given the same ones over and over again but at different speeds to simulate dynamic movement.  The characters themselves --as well as the entire game-- might as well be N64 or PSX fishermen and fisherwomen. All they have to do is look left, right and behind as you steer the boat around fishing locations and even that looks painfully stiff.  Sound None. Granted fishing is a quiet sports but there's nothing to listen to in this game. You hear the splash when the lure hits the water and the clickety click of your reel as you bring it in (with no fish on it).   The default background music is pretty sad, sounding like something a deranged pianist might play at a funeral home for clowns. Ugh. If you absolutely must play a fishing game on your Xbox, you still should avoid Pro Cast Sports Fishing. I'm not that great of a fisherman, and so a little appreciation from a fishing videogame would've been nice. Instead you're given all of the headaches of a bad fishing trip but without the beer. If you absolutely must get a headache while playing your Xbox, you should still avoid Pro cast Sports Fishing.", "date": "Sep 5, 2003"}
