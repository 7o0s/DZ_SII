Since when did getting pinned under a hailstorm of enemy fire, listening to rounds zip within millimetres of your face, become such a great way to spend our spare time? But in Call of Duty 4 (COD4), it most certainly is, and the more realistic it has become, the more we can't wait to go and risk our virtual lives all over again. COD4 shows ably why Infinity Ward is the master crafter of the shooter genre, building and layering above the foundation it so wonderfully created with the original Call of Duty.   Like prior Call of Duty games, there are multiple characters that you'll play in COD4, but this time it's limited to two. You'll fill the boots of a US Marine in the game's explosive, over the top battle levels, while the sneaky, stealthy SAS scenes give you a breather when you need it. The difference in pacing between the two main characters is perfect, giving the game great variety and helping to flesh out the solid storyline from two different perspectives. The plot is the standard 'terrorist steals nuke' kind of escapade commonly found in Clancy novels, but is beautifully delivered via several means. Gorgeous videos introduce each level, setting the scene for the mayhem to come, while believable dialogue breathes life into the game's main stars. The result is a story that might not be the most original premise for war, but it's one that's very realistic and thus provides real motivation for getting the job done.     You'll probably be too overwhelmed by the spectacular action in COD4 to pay much attention to the story though. Like its predecessors, COD4 is an adrenaline-overdose of a roller coaster ride. It's still very linear, eschewing the concept of sandbox gameplay, yet it's a much richer, more focused experience for it. Beautifully scripted set pieces are commonplace, from avoiding a prowling helicopter's spotlight, to escorting an M1A1 Abrahams through a busy Middle Eastern town, to manning the grenade launcher on a friendly Marine chopper.   When you're not taking part in these cinematic one-off moments, at its heart COD4 is what Call of Duty has always been - ploughing through wave after wave of incoming enemies. Yes, the old off-screen spawn system is still in place, delivering a healthy supply of meat targets until you cross an invisible line, but it rarely becomes the frustrating experience of COD3. This time around the number of both friendly and enemy combatants has been given a massive boost, with fire-fights often involving upwards of forty or so characters. Throw in tanks, helicopters and a myriad of other vehicles, and it becomes a deafening assault on your senses. There's so much going on that it often takes multiple attempts at a section before you've got the faintest idea of what you're meant to do. Your poor surround sound speakers will barely have time to rest from one battle to the next, while every pixel on your screen gets a workout from the hundreds of bullet strikes and explosions that they won't soon forget.    Thankfully you'll have some smart squad members by your side to help you make it through the overwhelming action. The AI in COD4 is a definite step up from prior Call of Duty games, with your squad mates calling out the location of enemies, taking cover where appropriate and even throwing back enemy grenades. They'll occasionally wander directly into your line of fire, which became a bit of an issue during one section, but for the most part they'll take cover or move when it's appropriate.     The enemy AI has also been through the education system, remaining behind cover when it needs it, and proving to be a crack shot. Thankfully you can now blast through nearly every form of cover in the game. That's right, we've finally got full bullet penetration, which totally changes the dynamic of battles. Just as in real life, a measly brick wall isn't going to stop the rounds from an M-249 SAW, and there are few sights more satisfying than seeing an enemy crumple to the ground after you pump a full clip into his hiding place.   As we mentioned, the action in COD4 comes thick and fast, and it's all delivered via some of the most gorgeous graphics we've ever seen on the 360. It's amazing that the game remains at a rock solid 60 frames per second when there's so much detail to be found. The lighting of the engine is one of its highlights, demonstrated beautifully in one of the opening levels that takes place in the middle of a storm. With each burst of lightning, it's hard not to notice the accurate shadowing and glare off every surface of the boat you're about to storm. This level also shows off the gorgeous weather effects, which are employed across multiple levels in the game.   But where the visuals truly shine is in an area that is strangely often overlooked in shooters - the things that do the shooting. Without doubt, these are the sexiest, most realistic virtual depictions of guns ever seen in a game. The gun modellers and animators at Infinity Ward deserve a pay rise and a long vacation after the stellar work they've done in giving these polygonal models a sense of awe-inspiring power. Combined with absolutely brutal sound effects and bullet strike effects, you'll end up spending time shooting at anything in sight, just to see the weapons in action. Walls, cars, tires, bottles, anything - firing the guns in COD4 is a visceral and addictive experience.     We've mentioned the great dialogue already, but it's the way it's delivered that makes it so believable. COD4 has top-notch voice acting, with our favourite being the gruff voice of the SAS commander who takes you under his wing. The sounds of battle are captured wonderfully as well, making us wonder just how many simultaneous sound effects the 360's sound hardware can handle. Finally, as we've come to expect from the Call of Duty series, the music is worthy of a Hollywood epic. Keep your ear out for the slightly weird, but mainly cool, rap song at the end of the game, written and recorded by one of the game's devs.   All of these elements combine to create what is quite possibly the 360's finest straight-up shooter. But it's not without issue. First and foremost is the game's length - try this on normal difficulty and you'll zip through in about six hours. Therefore we highly recommended playing on hardened mode, which should bump up the campaign by another couple of hours, without ever proving too frustrating.     The one feature that is sorely missed is co-operative play. It pains us to think how brilliant it would have been to have a mate by our side during the terrific battles in the game - we've no doubt it's a feature that'll be included in COD5, but it's going to be a long wait. Still, even with these two shortcomings, we have no hesitation in recommending the single player game in COD4. But that's only half of the story... and quite possibly the least impressive of the two.   Infinity Ward knew it had a winner on its hands with COD4's online game, hence the widespread beta that burnt up several weeks of 360 gamers' lives. We're happy to report that the beta was just a taste of what was to come - COD4 will replace GRAW2, COD3, Rainbow Six and possibly even Halo 3 as the preferred method of eating up Internet bandwidth.   We've seen persistent ranking systems before, but none quite as addictive as the one in COD4. As expected, the longer you play, the more weapons and weapon add-ons you'll unlock, but the perk system is brand new to the shooter genre. Think of it as similar to a buff in World of Warcraft - you can customise your class with up to three perks, giving you a variety of bonuses depending on your tastes. Whether it's the ability to soak up more rounds, to cause more damage when firing through walls or to drop a live grenade as you die, these perks give every player on the field a personal touch. It's yet to be seen, but there could be a drawback to the otherwise compelling perk and weapon unlock system - novices to the game might struggle to keep up with more experienced, better-equipped players. Hopefully this won't be the case, instead inspiring players to keep logging in to build up their player, but only time will tell.     If you're sick of the two maps in the beta, the other 14 or so included in the final game should bring a grin to your face. This number of maps right off the bat is unheard of - Infinity Ward could have easily included only ten, and then sold the other six as downloadable content. Hats off to them for not doing so. Each of the maps is a work of art, and there's a massive amount of variety amongst them all.    The game uses a similar ranked matchmaking system to Halo 3, but the predefined game modes seem to have more variety than Halo's. When you're not playing a ranked match, a wide variety of server options allow you to tweak the game's setup - our favourite is Hardcore mode, which disables all HUD elements such as the crosshair and radar. This will no doubt prove popular with the Project Reality mod players. It might not have the lengthy feature list of certain other shooters, but theres no denying that COD4s strength is KISS  Keep it Simple, Stupid. By not trying to reinvent the wheel, Infinity Ward has done what it does best  build a shooter that is unrivalled when it comes to the sensation of being in a real warzone. With its captivating single player and addictive multiplayer, it appears that COD4 just might be the finest shooter to have hit the 360 yet.", "date": "Nov 7, 2007"}
