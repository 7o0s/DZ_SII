The health power-ups in this game, in that classic old-school style, are represented as big, fat chunks of roasted chicken, a leg for a little health and a whole chicken for a lot.  Maybe this means nothing to you, but it means everything to me.  Other than the chicken, this game bites the big one harder than almost any game on PlayStation 2 has bit it.  It takes a bad idea and runs headlong with it on a roller-coaster ride of wretched execution, until the whole mess finally collapses in a heap that's barely recognizable as a contemporary videogame.  The discs upon which it was burned should be re-distributed as free drink coasters for the poor, and its creators should undertake a long and thorough effort of soul-searching before embarking upon their next project.  Given that they made the ESPN X-Games Snowboarding titles, which were at least competent, I trust that they can recover given time, but they have somehow gone horribly wrong with this one.  Gameplay The high concept here can be snappily summed up as ~Snow Rash~ -- downhill snowboarding mixed up with hand-to-hand combat.  Objectives vary from level to level, including widget collection and traditional timed races, but every level regardless of its specific goal is populated by a wide variety of enemy snowboarders, whose aim it is to do our heroes a mischief with their chains, sledgehammers, razor-sharp boomerangs, nail-studded baseball bats, and so on.  The player, of course, can swing back with fists, feet, and a variety of weapons scattered about the slopes.  This is one of those ideas that sounds like great fun on paper and works terribly in practice.  It's no surprise that the designers of SSX decided to make combat the parsley sprig instead of the prime rib.  The nature of a snowboarding simulation is such that the player has invariably imprecise control over the character's momentum, so attacking a target generally boils down to aiming in their general direction and hammering on the punch button.  The game's creators, sensing that any attempt to demand precision of the player would go even more horribly wrong, have implemented dead-simple movement controls, ridiculously loose hit detection, and obvious catch-up AI routines, designed to bring enemies in range.  That last feature could be construed as aggressiveness on their part, except that they launch attacks of their own with little frequency and less accuracy.  The result is a brawler with less logic or depth than Double Dragon or even Bad Dudes Vs. Dragon Ninja.  Compounding the fighting system's problems is the lack of interesting objectives to give form to the levels.  There are time attack levels (race to the goal), collection levels (run through X number of objects), score challenges (get X number of points), and combat levels (beat up X number of opponents).  Boss encounters are merely variations on the combat levels, since bosses differ from ordinary opponents only in that you have to hit them more often.  Eight different courses are available, with 10 or so objectives apiece, but none of them stray from those three basic templates.  You just have to collect different numbers of objects, beat up different numbers of opponents, and race against different time limits.  Obviously, this gets very old very fast, since completing all the goals requires that the player race down the same courses a dozen times or more apiece.  The track design offers a few shortcuts, forks, and alternate routes, but it's not even within top-of-your-lungs shouting distance of SSX in that regard.  When the tracks choose to get more complex, later on in the game, a basic contradiction in the boarder controls arises.  Nearly every aspect of the control has been blown all the way out the arcade end of the spectrum -- you will see some utterly irrational collision behavior in this game -- save for the jumping mechanics, which are still as persnickety as they were in the ESPN games.  The trouble is, jumping gaps in those games required concentration and careful preparation, which is a little difficult when you're being shoved around by half a dozen chain-wielding thugs.  Making it over a gap in this game is thus irrationally difficult, a critical failing in race challenges.        Where the game's eponymous evolution is meant to be taking place, I cannot tell.  The ESPN snowboarding titles were not bad games -- they weren't all that accessible to players who didn't enjoy their sim focus, but what they chose to do, they did well.  This game, on the other hand, takes a questionable idea and proceeds to mangle it as thoroughly as could be imagined.  Its challenges are simple, and instead of coming up with new ideas to fill out the game with replay value, its creators chose instead to hammer those same challenges into the ground.  Graphics Along with the chicken, I suppose it is in Evolution Snowboarding's favor that it runs at a perfect framerate.  However, looking at the visuals being cranked along by the game engine, that comes as no surprise -- these graphics would not have been too out of place on the Nintendo 64.  It's actually a step back from the ESPN titles, which doesn't quite make sense, unless the need to draw so many more riders on the track makes considerably more substantial demands of the hardware.  The character models are none too complex, mind you.  The heroes are generic spiky-haired ski bums, with a predominance of urban camouflage and curiously pin-headed proportions.  They don't look like much, but at least they're improvements on the bad guys, who look like a child's mashed-potato sculptures strapped into snowboards.  If you think the opponents look silly while they're sliding around, wait until you kill one of them -- they disappear with a cheesy flash-bang as if they were alien spaceships in a 16-bit shooter.  Boss characters are a modest high point, thanks to their charmingly cheesy Road Warrior-styled designs, but even they fall victim to the game's limited animation and heavy filtering.  That filtering lends a certain Bouncer-esque blur to the proceedings, although it is perhaps not quite so pronounced.  It does its job to a degree, but one can still make out the simplicity of the textures, the lighting, and the track modeling beneath them.  The rails are simple and straightforward, the edges on halfpipes and the like are clearly defined, as if plopped there in the Tony Hawk skatepark editor.  There are attempts to introduce interactive elements to the tracks, but they're limited to simple destructible barriers.  Sound Despite its many regressions, though, Konami OSA has at least chosen to hop on the Pro Logic II bandwagon, which lends a neat enveloping feel to passages where the player is surrounded by opponents.  The directional sound would be more useful if there were any kind of strategy required in combat, but it's a nice touch nonetheless.  A less positive move, depending on your taste, is the licensing of Slipknot and a number of similar heavy metal bands to provide the soundtrack.  I can understand the kind of sound they were going for, that nu-metal grind to match the postapocalyptic visuals and repeated head-whacking, but this sort of music has only a limited appeal for me, especially when it's delivered in surround sound.  Your mileage may, of course, vary, and it is welcome to do so.On the other hand, questions regarding the soundtrack should remain merely academic, since I don't recommend buying this game whatever your musical taste might be.I've enjoyed many games in the beat-'em-up style before, going all the way back to Kung Fu Master on the NES, Bad Dudes in the arcades, all the Double Dragon games, Battletoads, the 3DO Road Rash, and plenty more.  But none of those games could be characterized as entirely mindless, even though that adjective is frequently used to precede the term ~beat-'em-up.~  They all had rhyme, reason, variety, and a little strategy, qualities which Evolution Snowboarding sorely lacks.That's its greatest failing, although its graphics aren't all that easy on the eyes, and Slipknot generally makes me reach for the mute button.  Hopefully, its creators can bounce back in the future with a more well-thought-out effort.", "date": "Dec 13, 2002"}
