Neither has the massive Barbarian Invasion expansion pack. When we heard that the gang at Creative Assembly were working on a second expansion for the game, focusing on the career of Alexander the Great, we were understandably excited. We've just spent the entire weekend playing through the new expansion and, while it's always good to get more Total War action, we were left wishing this latest offering had been a little more filled out. Still, for only fifteen bucks, it's hard to go wrong.  At first, we weren't even sure this was a Total War expansion. It doesn't have the word ~Invasion~ anywhere in the title. While Alexander's fierce advance was every bit as impressive as those of the Mongols, Vikings and Germanic barbarians, it's less the story of an inevitable clash between two warring people as it is the story of the ambitions and achievements of Alexander himself. Where previous expansions have allowed players to take charge of one of a number of empires during a crucial moment of conflict, this expansion is strictly limited to Alexander's campaign against the Persians.   Given the limited nature of the campaign, there are only four new civilizations here. The two heavy hitters are Alexander's Macedonians and Darius's Persians. Far to the east you'll discover the Indians and a variety of barbarians but they're really marginal powers that don't factor too heavily into the overall scheme of things. Continuing the trend started in Barbarian Invasion, Alexander will have to contend with plenty of unsettled rebel armies as well.  The game starts after Philip's death and just as Alexander is poised to move against the Thebans. Once he manages to secure things in Greece, he'll be free to move against the Persians in the east. To win the campaign game, you'll have to capture thirty territories. Though you'll have to hold a few specific territories, capturing thirty territories is basically the same as capturing the whole map so you really won't have to worry too much about getting the right territories. You will however have to worry about achieving your goals within the 100-turn time limit. (Since Alexander's conquests lasted only 13 years, the game dispenses with the year-by-year system and just progresses turn-by-turn.)   The campaign game is still dominated by city sieges but there seems to be much more fighting in the fields this time around. As Alexander's forces move east they'll encounter smaller garrisons supplemented by numerous enemy armies moving in between the cities. It's not infrequent to have to take out one or two armies before assaulting the city itself.  Just as the real Alexander had to secure freshly conquered areas before moving on, so too will you have to determine what type of empire to leave in your wake. The danger of rebels is severe enough to make it worth considering putting cities to the sword when you take them. The extra cash you get for this definitely helps to boost Alexander's horrible economy.  Since the invasion progresses along a single line of attack, you won't need to worry too much about building up the areas you've already conquered. Just leave a token garrison and push on. This approach means there's not a lot of room for strategic maneuvering but it also helps you build up a massive army of seasoned veterans who are capable of beating larger armies.  The Alexander focus seems too narrow, in my opinion, as it really only tells the final chapter of the conflict between the Greeks and Persians. Where previous expansions have told the story of massive conflicts between different peoples, this one just tells the story of one single campaign during a much larger war. When you consider that the developers might have included the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian Wars, the single campaign featured here seems a little light. If nothing else, it would be cool to at least play as the Persians as they try to hold back Alexander's advance.      In addition to the new campaign, the game includes a series of six historical battles showcasing key moments in Alexander's career, from his command of his father's cavalry at Chaeronea to his confrontation with the Indian king's elephants at Hydaspes. Each of the battles must be beaten in order to unlock the next, so you won't be able to jump straight to Gaugamela until you've beaten Issus. Though slightly limited in terms of scale, each of the battles here is true to the geography and force composition outlined in the history books.  One cool new feature is the addition of tournament battles. They allow players to go online to play through these linked battles in order. (Well, all except Chaeronea, which was Philip's battle anyway.) Players can take on the first three, last three or all five battles in a one-on-one or two-on-two format. Whichever player or team wins the majority of battles is declared the winner of the tournament. While it requires a little more commitment in terms of time, these tournaments also provide a lot more context than the simple one-off battles of previous games.   There are a few things that are just missing from the game. First off, there's no option for diplomacy. Given the nature of the conflict, it wouldn't make any sense for Alexander and Darius to be making nice with each other, so the option is completely cut out of the game. It also seems like the night battles and swimming options from Barbarian Invasion are gone as well. Though it's not a big loss, it's interesting that the features don't show up anywhere in the new expansion.  The new units are pretty cool. The Macedonians specialize in heavy infantry and tons of cavalry but they lack ranged troops. The toughest horsemen in their roster are the powerful Companion Cavalry, seasoned riders who can punch through most enemy lines. Alexander himself leads a huge group of these cavalry into battle. Their infantry lines include numerous types of hoplites and skirmishers built around a core of hardy Phalangists.  The Persians have a wide variety of troops, including the most powerful units in the game. The Phrygian mercenaries aren't quite as tough as the Macedonian Phalangists but they're more powerful on the attack than any other type of infantry in the game. The Persians also rely heavily on their Immortals, spearmen who can pull double duty as ranged attackers.   The other two civilizations, the Indians and Barbarians, have much a more limited selection of troops. The Indian infantry are almost all exclusively ranged attackers with a few light cavalry units. Of course, they make up for their lack of variety by having units of elephants trampling all over the battlefield. The Barbarian side relies on loads and loads of light infantry. They're not entirely without tough units, however, and their deadly Sicklemen can go toe-to-toe with almost any other heavy infantry unit in the game.  Graphics and sound haven't changed much since the last expansion. We've got slightly better graphics cards now, and the game's visuals have scaled up nicely. The new units are very nicely rendered with loads of cool touches. I particularly like the Boeotian helmets and leopard pelts on the Companion Cavalry. It seems like every unit has some nice little detail like that.  Don't look for Alexander on store shelves any time soon. It's currently being offered only as a download off of SEGA's site.I'm always glad for an excuse to revisit Creative Assembly's Total War series and the Alexander expansion is definitely a welcome addition. The new units and the new campaign let players fight in one of the most celebrated campaigns in all of military history. As always, the gameplay and graphics really bring the experience to life.Still, the limited nature of the expansion keeps it from being a ~must have~ addition for those who aren't quite as hungry as I am for new Total War content. Containing none of the breadth of new units and new strategies that the Total War expansions have been known for, Alexander feels more like a mission pack. Thanfully, the fifteen-dollar price tag makes it a little easier to accept but, if you're like me, you'd rather have paid twice as much for content that would last a little longer.", "date": "Jun 20, 2006"}
