The Game Boy Advance has one top-notch strategy game that blows the rest of the competition out of the water, and that game is Advance Wars.  We knew it the first time we played it, we still know it now, and in 30 years we'll still know it.  Any and every strategy game on a Nintendo system since Advance Wars made a US launch is being compared to the classic, and that's no easy standard to live up to.  At the same time, diversity during these slower months on the system really does go a long way, and it's now that games like Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation, while not perfect by any means, get their chance to show gamers what they've got.   For those unfamiliar with the world of Super Robot Taisen (and that should be most of you, since it was Japan-only up until now), the series is rooted on classic anime characters and worlds under the common name ~Super Robot Wars~.  The main concept of the Super Robot franchise is to combine multiple anime and manga franchises (particularly those using huge robots or mecha units) into one big turn-based strategy/role-paying game.  If players want to play out ~what if~ situations inspired by the likes of Evangelion and Gundam, they can do it in Super Robot Wars.  The series got its start back in the days of the Famicom, and have made appearances on nearly every major system since then, including Game Boy, Super Famicom, Mobile Phone, and Playstation.  In Japan, the Super Robot series is as prominent as Nintendo's own ~Wars~ series we now embrace in the US.   If it's so popular though, why not get it in the US earlier?  It's simple, really.  Much like the DS fighter ~Jump Superstars~, the Super Robot Wars games are a collection of tons of different branding, and since each of the shows are making their way across the pond one-by-one for American viewers, they're being picked up by different companies.  Putting out a game that included the brands of every feature anime just isn't going to happen.  Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation is different, however, as it focuses on original cast members that are simply set in the same world as previous Super Robot games.  Brands are implied, but never shown, making the Original Generation series an ideal candidate for the US market.  Luckily for us, Original Generation is not only the perfect American release choice, it also has a ton of addictive gameplay to offer.   Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation puts players in the cockpit of a new proto-type mech as the hero/heroine leads an elite team of robot pilots against the forces of evil in classic turn-based battles.  Everything about the gameplay screams Advance Wars, but Original Generation sets itself apart from the competition by offering a ton of internal tweaking and customization for nearly every key character (and mech) in the game.  Rather than just sending units into battle with the hopes of leveling up, players will actually have the chance to build the mecha units from the ground up, adding special attacks, weapon systems, defensive protocols, and overall attributes to their fighters.  The core gameplay still boils down to moving units one at a time, but the amount of depth available off the battle field makes the fights themselves far more interesting.  If you choose to create an entire team of melee fighters, focusing entirely on hand-to-hand combat, you can.  Things are going to get rough once you battle quicker distance mechs, but it's still your call.   In fact, the actual battles in Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation actually take a back-seat to the other more unconventional gameplay elements.  Players be warned:  This game isn't a walk in the park, and it's anything but mainstream.  To play Original Generation right, you're going to be spending as much time in text menus as you are on the field, though the game is extremely rewarding to anyone willing to put an investment into it.  Not only can each mech be tweaked, each pilot can also learn special abilities, as the design manages to infuse strategy battles with role-playing game elements as well.  Each battle is carried out with in-game story along with it, so every attack has fighters taunting each other and delivering campy (but entertaining) dialogue before each blow.  Expected options are still available, allowing players to turn off battle or movement animations as they see fit, but you'll also be removing some of the style the game has to offer, as character personality develops not only between battles, but also during.  In addition, there are a ton of cast members (kicking it off with about two-dozen, and working form there in a matter of hours), affirming the design as a true hybrid of anime/manga, strategy gameplay, and RPG elements.  It's an odd mix, but it's also very entertaining.     When it comes to the production value though, Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation comes up a bit shy at times.  Much like Advance Wars, Super Robot Taisen works mainly within character portraits and tiny in-game icons that represent units.  During battles, the screen cuts to a more elaborate sequence showing the details of the battle.  With as much story and menu work as the design requires, however, you'll spend a huge amount of time looking at basic character portraits and generic text.  The animation and style of the super-deformed robots is awesome, but that's just one aspect of the design.  The main gameplay maps are very bland, and the game doesn't offer a ton of animation or character art outside of the attack sequences.  Imagine a game that's half level-up menus and half Advance Wars, and you've got the general feel for what Super Robot Taisen brings to the table.  It's hard to knock the game for its graphical limitations when looking at some of the awesome chibi-robot designs and animations (some of which are both hilarious and technically impressive), but the rest of the game is seriously scaled down in style, and that hurts the product.  Mix the inconsistent visual presentation with very generic (but still entertaining) audio composition, and you've got a game that relies almost entirely on turn-based strategy and RPG gameplay to hold it together.  So after years of being a Japanese-exclusive series, is Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation really worth the wait?  That will entirely depend on you.  If youre looking for a classic niche strategy game that focuses as much on turn-based battle as it does customization, Super Robot Taisen definitely has the formula down.  Be warned, however, as the games amazing sense of style and attitude can often be lost in the bland battlefield maps and near-infinite text-only tweaking sessions spent away from battles, as the series is definitely more concerned with delivering a balanced gameplay than high-scale visual and audio presentation.  The game has a bit of a dated look and feel, but the gameplay is solid, and that alone will be worth it for some people.  For anyone looking for a solid strategy/RPG, Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation may just be the solution, as long as youre willing to put gameplay first.  And plus, its the only game out there where characters shout the words That doesnt even count as damage! at their enemies.  Not bad not bad at all.", "date": "Jul 27, 2006"}
