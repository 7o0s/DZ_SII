Features:  New tools and animals to work with A complete town to explore and meet people in Special hidden arcade-like mini-games  Trade fish and bugs between Harvest Moon 2 and the upcoming Legend of the River King 2 Only for Game Boy Color    You wouldn't guess from the concept of a farming sim, but Harvest Moon is at once the most hectic and, at the same time, freeing games out there. There are so many things to do, and there are so many choices, that there's no way to get it all done. So the gameplay is all up to the player -- do you run ragged every hour of every day trying to keep the farm working at peak output, or do you spend some more of your life trying to make connections, exploring your options, and living your life?  Those options aren't entirely all there still in Harvest Moon 2, which is still a limited version of the beloved SNES and N64 farming RPGs. Natsume again wasn't able to pack everything of Harvest Moon into portable form, and the unfortunately lost part is a big portion of what made this series such a darling import -- the dating and marriage sim portions won't be found in this sequel. That means that these poor farmers are working themselves down to the bone again for the job, for the good of their goal, but not for the grace of a family and the promise of life lived happily ever after.  But seeing as how it may be quite a wait for the third Harvest Moon (just about released in Japan), which finally brings the wedding vows to the Game Boy Color, there's still much to enjoy with our latest Harvest Moon. Even without the dating sim aspects, there's still a lot more that's been packed into this little cartridge for Harvest farmers, including a vastly expanded game world, more animals and plants to raise, a full town to explore, quicker gameplay, Game Boy Color-specific graphics, and many, many more improvements. It may be just an expansion on the already existing Harvest Moon GBC, but everything added gives more gaming on the brief original and provides a more complete experience.  With every new version of Harvest Moon, Natsume changes the story and concept slightly so that every version offers something slightly different. This time, the magical gnomes and mythic concept of pleasing your passed grandfather from the first game is completely gone, replaced with a more conventional but pressing game where the family farm has to turn a profit before local land developers but it up and install a theme park. It may be a simpler story, but it's also more convenient, since dealing with the gnomes and figuring out how to deal with the little buggers to make them do things for you was one of the pains of the first game. This just thrusts you into the task, and it's probably better for it.  In the place of a solid story is a better town and ebbing season function. There are half a dozen of characters to talk with, as well as a bulletin board to check and another half-dozen shops to check out. In practice, talking to townsfolk is mostly a waste of time, since they mostly have generic strings of speech (that, unfortunately, do not change much with the seasons), but there are occasional chats that reward with a continued friendship or special gift.  The game world is drastically bigger in Harvest Moon 2, providing plenty of places to plant the crops and house your animals. There are also expansions available for the house, the field, and the farm, including a full greenhouse for raising flowers. The original Harvest Moon GBC was so small that it eventually came to the point that every inch is used up, and there was nothing to do once general tasks are done. This time out, there's no way to keep up with it all, and the added strategy now deepens the game with a myriad of choices to make in a given day.  Of course, sometimes you just choose to goof off, and so just in real life, there are plenty of diversions to take up your time. Some of the mini-functions aren't as fun as they could be -- fishing is randomized and not based on skill, maybe because Natsume would rather you bought Legend of the River King instead for an angler itching. But the two main mini-games, the brilliantly addictive Whack-a-Mole and the wild Cherry Cup Horse Races are fun, and if ever players want to re-indulge in a goof-off session rather than get the day's chores done, they can purchase ~videogame home versions~ of these to play whenever they want. Also, you can collect fish and bugs to trade between the upcoming Legend of the River King 2 (which is the only way to catch certain fish in that game), or print out scrapbook shots of these animals and other special event photos on the Game Boy Printer.   Diversions aside, Harvest Moon's core gameplay of frantic farming against the passing seasons is much improved in this new game. This storyline allows a lot more time in the three-year lifespan -- even though the first game never truly ended, it ran up against its limits before the one-year calendar ran out. This time, there is so much to do between all the crops, the animals, the town, and the expanding world (which includes a secret garden and an island area that can be bridged across to, providing enough funds) that it all flies by. It's still very repetitive gameplay, since every day of gameplay is spent doing the same task over and over again, but somehow this becomes addictive and great fun trying to squeeze it all in before nightfall.  Partly, the charm of Harvest Moon is in the simple and clever graphics, which are even cleaner and more pretty over the old Game Boy version. Now the entire color pallet is used, and there's a very nice transition between the hours of the day, as the sun slowly sets and casts its last rosy glow over the land. And though the music has a nasty habit of repeating in transitions between areas, theirs is a host of new musical compositions, including new tunes for every area you visit and changing music with every next season. The heart of Harvest Moon is still missing -- you still cannot fall in love in Harvest Moon 2, and the lack of that challenge again severely dampens the game. You're working towards a noble goal, but all the same, part of the charm of the series was it's combination of otaku Japanese concepts -- one was the niche RPG game, which is represented well in this version of the farming game, and the other is the equally idiosyncratic dating simulator game.Still, maybe Americans need a slower introduction to these foreign concepts -- perhaps some of us just aren't ready yet for a game about farming and about getting married. And, fitting comfortably in a niche of its own, Harvest Moon on the Game Boy is still a charming and enjoyable experience. With the sequel, it's equally more so. It seems strange, but this little farmer ends up being the most enjoyable, playable, and accessible RPG on the system, so while it is bound to bum out experienced Harvesters looking for something (or someone) to make the game worthwhile, the greenest of gamers will likely enjoy quite a few seasons in this farm.", "date": "Nov 29, 2000"}
