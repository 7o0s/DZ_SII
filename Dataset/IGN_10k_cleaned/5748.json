I am a second generation fan of the magazine and it was my first exposure to graphic humor and the art of mockery. Spy vs. Spy wasn't my favorite aspect of the monthly release, but I was hoping some of the quirky humor that has been in print for years would rub off on the game. At the very least, the game could have been an improvement on the classic game by Kemco released on numerous systems over a decade ago. Instead the game is a mix of bland exploration and combat with unresponsive controls.    The single player mode of Spy vs. Spy is broken into three sections. The story mode presents the deepest gameplay experience, although even this is painfully simple. In each level a spy starts in their hideout where they can purchase tools and weapons. This safe zone can also be visited at any time to replenish health. The goals of story mode are varied, but it usually includes retrieving a special item from a safe hidden somewhere in the level.    Blocking your path is an army of goons and of course, rival spies. The most enjoyable aspects of the game are the numerous items that players use to ice their foes and escape booby traps. Weapons range from the standard karate chop, to clubs, chainsaws, bazookas, and flame throwers. There are also mines and door traps that are used to make your surroundings as deadly as your spy. Counters can be used to prepare for booby traps on doors or safes. For example, a spy can carry a monkey wrench to neutralize the spring loaded boxing gloves that are stuffed inside of safes.    The story mode contains a small percentage of platforming mixed with choosing the right items to accomplish you goals. The level objectives are often confusing and the large floating arrows don't always steer players in the right direction. The HUD shows players what weapons are equipped and how much money they have accrued so far. Spy's can strafe and jump, but falling from more than twice their height inflicts fall damage. The controls feel unresponsive for some of the weapons and annoying platforming elements lead to repeated deaths. As for the level design, it is filled with dead areas that bring the already slow gameplay screeching to a halt.     Classic mode has similar gameplay to the story except that it takes place in the confines of an embassy setting. This is more like the original Spy vs. Spy that was released so long ago. Players set traps, search for secret items, and try to escape with the goods. The game supports four player split screen and bots. Removing the lame platforming elements from story mode suits the game better although throughout Spy vs. Spy I had the overwhelming feeling that removing things from this game could only improve it.    There are four other multiplayer modes that are really just four variations of deathmatch. My favorite aspect of this game was setting up traps to fool enemies, and these game types throw this element out the window. There is the option to use traps, but Deathmatch quickly degenerates into a bunch of spies whacking each other over the head with blunt objects.     All multiplayer modes can be taken onto Xbox Live. My online experience involved many games with young children who enjoyed yelling into the headset. This is actually the best audience for Spy vs. Spy. The simple premise and cartoon style should actually suit the eight to 10 year old crowd just fine. Parents should take note that Xbox Live users can introduce children to some nasty language and the game is rated Teen for cartoon violence and crude humor.      I spy  Spy vs. Spy has a somewhat stylized approach to the visuals that works better with the characters than it does with the environments. The floating monkeys in the carnival level have a wacky design that adds to the comic mayhem in the game. However, the level itself is drab, empty, and sparsely populated with these characters. An outer space level develops the basics of atmosphere, but most environments look like early PlayStation 1 games with a few more polygons thrown in. The sounds of spying are wholly unremarkable. The blips and blops of combat and the menu system could easily be recreated on a Game Boy. Like the comic, spies never speak so there is little reason to keep the sound on at all.   Spy vs. Spy is lacking in most areas that make games enjoyable. The controls arent terrible, but the basic gameplay of story mode is so bland that it is difficult to stay interested in it for more than five minutes. The classic mode is the best reason to play the game, but its not a compelling reason to pay money for it. Fans of the cartoon would be better off sticking with the printed page.", "date": "May 7, 2005"}
