{"name": "Will Rock", "name_review": "Will Rock Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/26/will-rock-review", "text": "If Will Rock's nonsensical introductory slide-show doesn't set the intellectual tone for what's coming, the main menu screen should leave no doubt whatsoever in your mind: A goofy, animated stone gargoyle face moves its jaw in no particular synch to Twisted Sister's ~I Wanna Rock.~ Even the difficulty levels are grunting and monosyllabic: ~Will Win,~ ~Will Play,~ and ~Will Die.~ And there you have it: Check your brain at the door (except the parts required for basic motor functions) and get ready to, well, Rock.   The story, such as it is, revolves around a dude-ish archaeology student (his name really is ~Will Rock~) whose mentor is killed by the ~Olympian Restoration Army,~ a nut-job paramilitary/terrorist group bent on restoring the whole of ancient Greece, mythical entities and all. Sure, why not? So it is that our two-fisted archeology intern--specially chosen as avenging hero by the god Prometheus, who evidently has a really wicked rock habit of his own--enters the gateway to mystical Olympus to honor his fallen teacher, save his virginal girlfriend, and...oh, just never mind. Find some guns and start killing stuff, okay?   From the first moment that way-too-fast skeletons start chucking spears your way and beeline straight for you with ungodly speed, it's pretty clear that Will Rock is at heart a spiritual cousin to the (in)famous Serious Sam. Throughout ten single-player levels filled with columns, stadiums, marble statues, ancient pottery and all kinds of other Doric impedimentia and vaguely-Greek crap lying about, you'll have wave after wave after wave of natural and super-natural enemies coming at you until they kill you or you kill them.   Even on the theoretically ~normal~ difficulty setting, the sheer numbers arrayed against you are just ridiculous, and the frequency with which they continually respawn--erupting out of the floors, walls and ceilings--elevates the experience to a kind of inspired lunacy. Whatever your feelings about Will Rock's setting or difficulty, you won't get bored anytime soon. You've constantly got the whole Greek Mythology section of the Monster Manual coming at you: Hulking, ripped minotaurs, cloven-hoofed archers, reanimated skeletons, and even alabaster statues that suddenly come to life (unloading the sculpted Earths from their muscular shoulders and throwing them at you). For some reason, there are also some nasty, oversized rats with explosives strapped to them, scurrying around like so many jihad vermin. Some foes, once hit, simply split into two new foes and resume their charge. Will Rock is a madhouse.   In certain outdoor levels you'll even have them coming at you from the skies, so you should be extra careful; apparently, the birds of prey from Greek yore poop long, runny jets of napalm. No wonder the whole ancient Greece act eventually went south.   To be fair, though, you're pretty heavily armed yourself. You have at your disposal a serious arsenal -- pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rocket/fireball launchers, mini-guns, grenades, and acid and Medusa guns, not to mention a ~sniper crossbow~ that would probably be cooler still if you had more actual time to stay put and use the damned thing. Most of the time, however, chill-time is a luxury you simply don't have. The instant, and I mean the nanosecond, that you spot someone or something through that magnified scope, the thing also sees you, and if it has a chance to come charging at you it probably will. Ammunition is plentiful, and your best bet is to just keep running and gunning. The levels are generously strewn with (presumably) ancient vessels, vases, urns and crates but they often have pick-ups or treasure inside them, so feel free to lay waste to all the precious antiquities around you, you dedicated, historical preservationist, you.    If fact, you'll want to accumulate treasure because it allows you to pay tribute to your sponsor/god, Prometheus. Since the titan has chosen you as his hero, he will imbue you with the titan powers of invincibility, slow motion or extra damage for short periods of time...if you make the proper treasure tributes as his altars scattered throughout the game. Even with all this supernatural aid, prepare yourself to hear rebukes like ~Fool! Now darkness will reign for a thousand years!~ as you die over and over and over.   Yes, the forces pitted against you are great in number and way too fast and accurate with long-range weapons...but they're pretty stupid. Rock-stupid. And you want them that way: You want them mindlessly charging for you in lines to be conveniently gunned down, or getting hung up behind statues or in corners. Sometimes they'll even run around brainlessly, forgetting to attack you because they're chasing their invisible friends. It's all good, because it almost makes up for Will Rock's endless pre-scripted ambushes, spawn-fests and other diversions. Whatever else may be said about it, Will Rock is a hard game. Finishing it may become a matter of pride long after the matter of actual fun is no longer a live issue.    The environments look good enough and have a fittingly ~period~ style, but they're disappointingly empty and devoid of much personality. Puzzles elements, if you can call them that, are rarely more engaging than standard find-the-key progressions, or simply digging in and trying to outlast the incoming hoards of enemies (although there are some fun bits with catapults). Bosses are fittingly huge and do indeed make one feel small in all the important respects, but there's a depressing lack of personality and humor to the whole outing -- ~Rock Nukem~ it ain't. Even hero Will Rock is on the quiet side, and the occasional lines he does crack out are uninspired. Pity, really, as more attention in these areas might have tipped the balance into a better-than-average value title.   And value-title it is. In addition to the main game, there is a mere handful of three basic multiplayer types, plus one co-op main-game mode. And yet, after all these knocks at the title, I'm still firing it up and playing it off and on, for the sheer adrenaline rush (and, God help me, sense of real accomplishment, complete with physical perspiration) that comes with wading hip-deep into a dungeon full of respawning hoards and handing them their mythological asses.Will Rock has some misses, but for twenty bucks, it delivers an action-packed, no-brain-required show. If you're one of the those who routinely played Serious Sam, swore a lot, died a lot and then found yourself doing it again, here's a Rock you just might want to crawl under for a while.", "date": "Jun 26, 2003"}
