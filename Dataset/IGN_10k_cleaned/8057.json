Cat Daddy Games attempts to answer the impossible question with their interactive rendition of NBC's popular Deal or No Deal. Hosted by bald comedian Howie Mandel, the TV show's highlights include gorgeous women holding numbered silver cases and inane, overenthusiastic contestants. Most of the show's elements, including the women and completely brainless contestant helper banter, make the transition to the PC along with some extra content. While fans of the show will surely appreciate the production and customization options, Deal or No Deal remains little more than a glorified scratch off ticket. Only this time, there's no real money.   Here are the rules. There are 26 cases on the board, each of which contains a dollar amount ranging from one cent to one million dollars. To start off, players pick one case as their own, leaving 25 on the board. For the rest of the game it's in the player's interest to pick cases containing lower dollar amounts, increasing the odds that the case they are holding houses a big monetary value. After varying numbers of cases are opened, the game pauses. A banker, whose identity is shrouded in mystery, then places a call to Howie and relays a dollar amount offer to get you to stop playing. The better the odds that your case contains a big dollar amount, the higher the offer is. It's then the player's decision to accept or reject the banker's offer by exclaiming deal or no deal. Accepting the offer ends the game and the player receives whatever figure the banker quoted. Rejecting the offer means the game continues, and the player goes on to select a few more cases until the banker is ready to make another offer. If the player continues to choose cases containing small dollar amounts, the banker's offer will continue to increase. Should the player keep on rejecting deals until only two cases remain, one on the board and their own, they can then choose which to open and keep that amount. So while there's no way to really lose the game of Deal or No Deal, you could theoretically win the game and leave with one cent.    The fact that such an idiotic game, where neither skill nor knowledge is required to win, is popular serves as yet another example of how our American culture is an embarrassing mess. That being said, the video game version of the show can actually function as a great tool for anyone looking to gamble with household chores, eat jellybeans, or come up with a creative drinking game. The game offers a number of modes to try and diversify gameplay. For solo play, you can engage in either a single game or a challenge game, which is five single games strung together. In both modes, your total dollar amount at the end is added to an offline leaderboard.   Three mini-games are included as well, the results of which are compiled on yet more leaderboards. Five Case Monte challenges players to keep their eye on the case containing one million dollars as it flips and switches places with four other cases. The more selections you make correctly, the longer the game lasts and the faster the cases move. There's a Puzzle Game where you move around blocks to match a picture, and a memory challenge where you open cases and try to match up identical pictures of the case girls.    None of the features described so far are entertaining for more than two minutes. Though the game does give you the option of selecting three ~helpers~ who you can consult for advice when it comes time to accept or reject the banker's deal, they never say anything interesting. You can select a few different characters, including a few dogs that can miraculously speak English, as helpers, but they're all equally useless. All the single player content offered in Deal or No Deal is a flat, unfulfilling, mindless gaming experience. Mostly, this is due to the fact that without a real money incentive, Deal or No Deal isn't actually a game, just random clicking. It's like buying a slot machine program for your PC where you only win fake money.     What saves this gaming package, sort of, is one of the three two player modes. The other two are pretty useless. In Head-to-Head, players compete directly against each other for bigger dollar amounts. Hotseat has one player act as a contestant, the other as the banker who can offer custom dollar amounts. Customized Games are the only conceivable reason to ever play this game, since they let you enter your own titles for the categories. Customized Games have three subsets, custom, quantity, and duration prizes. Each come with a few category templates. Duration, for instance, has a foot rub template where the one cent category is replaced with ~Foot Rub - 00:00~ and one million dollars is replaced with ~Foot Rub - 1:00:00.~ The idea here is that one player acts as the contestant, one as the dealer, and each compete against each other for real world consequences. The quantity subset is the same thing as duration, but uses totals in place of time limits. Sit-ups is one of the templates in quantity, with 99 sit-ups in the one cent spot and 0 sit-ups in the million slot.   Conceivably, you could use these customizable categories to decide anything around the house. For instance, you could determine which movie your family is going to rent, which  restaurant you're going out to, how many times you need to empty the dishwasher, or how many miles you're going to run that day. If you're in college or just an alcoholic, Deal or No Deal could be the conduit though which you create an excellent drinking game. Since the customizable options allow you to build in real world consequences, it makes playing this pseudo game a little more entertaining.    Though the game isn't much to look at, it does manage to recreate the look and feel of the show. Many of the screens you see in the game mimic the camera angles used on the TV show, and the case girls' dresses will occasionally change color. Howie has quite a bit of voice work in the game, though you can count on it getting repetitive rather quickly. The sounds do a good job at reflecting those from the show, which isn't saying much. Should you get sick of the theatrics, which you will, you can mouse through all that to get to the decision screens as fast as possible. Despite this being a budget priced title, it's odd to see a game completely devoid of a graphics option menu. You'll have to settle for 800 x 600, the game's default resolution.The video game version of TV's Deal or No Deal suffers because it isn't really a game to begin with. It's like scratching off a shiny, curvaceous lottery ticket. When the payoff for doing so isn't real money, there isn't any reason to bother with it. The only redeeming factors in this package are the customizable modes where you can switch the default monetary values with anything you want. Though that may help determine who's cooking dinner on Tuesday, it won't be all that fun.", "date": "Feb 15, 2007"}
