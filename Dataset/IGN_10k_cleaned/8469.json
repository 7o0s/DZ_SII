From the moment you send your cars rocketing across the first rollercoaster track, the speakers of your handset radiate the glorious call of the cow bell. It's a small detail in a largely excellent package, but it's an important one. With just one small audio stroke, the player is put in a positive frame of mind to enjoy the rest of the game. And that's what indeed happened during the majority of the play-test for Digital Chocolate's Rollercoaster Rush 3D -- all smiles.   Rollercoaster Rush 3D is largely similar to the original title, released last year to great acclaim by multiple review sites including IGN Wireless. The goal of the game is simple. You are the brakeman for a wild rollercoaster company. Your goal is to give an increasingly lengthy train of riders the thrill of their lives... without accidentally taking their lives. (Actually, there is no death in Rollercoaster Rush. Any passengers bucked by a wild ride parachute to safety.) You send riders flying over crests, down steep declines, across gaps in the track, and through giant loops. After each successful run, you can watch it via a dynamic replay.   The only thing you control in Rollercoaster Rush is the speed of the cars. By pressing to the right, you increase the velocity. Pull back to the left to decrease the ride speed. You need to find the right balance for the different track features, such as gunning it to mount tall inclines, but hitting the brakes in time so the car doesn't go ass over teakettle on the way back down. Within just a few seconds, you'll get the drift of the game, but then spend dozens of subsequent sessions trying to perfect your runs through the crazy courses.   While racing through the loops and launching the cars over jumps, you'll pick up hidden trophies for giving the riders an extra thrill. As you complete courses, earning stars for hitting certain scores, your coaster car picks up additional cars. With extra passengers, you can multiply your score. The happier you make each rider, the more stars you'll pick up. So while you'll never get all five stars the first time you try out a track with a short train, if you return to it with a four-car train, you can finally earn the remaining stars. DChoc keeps the track times down so it's hardly a chore to repeat previously played courses.   So far, I've pretty much described both the 2D and 3D versions of the game. The big changes with the 3D edition are a helpful course map at the beginning of each run and, of course, the new coat of polygons. I tested the game on a Sony Ericsson w810i. The frame rate was very smooth. There was a little pop-up, but never on the part of the track my cars were currently using. Otherwise, the game looks fantastic. The backdrops for Paris, New York, and Australia are colorful as all get-out.  Rollercoaster Rush underscores Digital Chocolate's mastery of mobile sensibilities. The controls are simple. The concept -- running a rollercoaster -- is a near-universal pleasure. No track lasts longer than 90 seconds. The colors pop off the screen. The game is loaded with hidden achievements that pop up when you'll pulled off a move, like giving the riders a moment of zero gravity.If you bought the original Rollercoaster Rush (which I hit with an 8.9), upgrading to the 3D version might not be worth it -- the game is largely the same. But if you're new to Rush and have a 3D-enabled handset, definitely go with the 3D edition. It's a whip-smart ride. And it's got cow bell!", "date": "May 14, 2007"}
