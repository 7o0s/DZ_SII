So it's no wonder why in the past few years we've seen a serious saturation of snowboarding titles on game systems across the board. Boarder Zone from Infogrames is the first time the sport's hit the Game Boy Color. It's not perfect, but it's a decent first attempt. Features:  Three locations Four characters Race, slalom, and trick modes Only for Game Boy Color   It'd be nave to expect a game like 1080 Snowboarding on the Nintendo 64 -- after all, versatile 3D engines just aren't possible on the 8-bit handheld. Software Creations put together a great pseudo-3D, sprite-based engine for the Game Boy Color, much like what you'd find on a behind-the-car racing game for the system (Top Gear Pocket, for example). It's also one of the few games utilizing the newly-found high-color mode on the Game Boy Color (just take a look at the sunset during the game, or the photos during the menus). As you board down the slopes, the scenery obstacles pop in closer to simulate the 3D perspective. Unfortunately, the game engine doesn't offer any left or right curves to the slopes, so the only difference between the game's courses are the layout of the obstacles in the way.  The game is basically a race through the many courses in the game. Depending on which option you chose, you'll either have to qualify by beating the computer opponent to the end of the course, or pull off as many successful moves as possible before time runs out. You can even time yourself down the slope and race against your ~ghost~ to see how well you perform against yourself. The only things missing in this game are a link-cable mode so you can race a friend, as well as a half-pipe for those truly die-hard snowboarders. But judging from the capabilities of the game engine, a half-pipe is a bit on the extreme side of a wish -- but the link-cable mode should have been in here.  There are four characters and four different boards in the game that excel in different categories, so you'll need to find the proper combination that suits your needs. You pull off moves simply by taking to the air by jumping your board and pressing a button-controller combination. Rotate the control pad while in the air, and you'll perform spin moves -- can you pull off a 1080? You only score the points if you land the board successfully, so try not to get crazy with combo maneuvers. The addition of the tricks adds a lot to the excitement of the game, since you'll have to find the best place to pull them off.  The one big complaint about the game is the loosey-goosey controls. The developer wanted to simulate the feeling of slick snow and ice, but it's just really difficult to maneuver through the tight slalom gates. Just a bit tighter controls, and the game would have gotten a higher score. Boarder Zone has a really slick presentation -- Software Creations really knows the capabilities of the Game Boy Color and puts together as many techniques in one package as possible. The game needs a few more options to give it more variety, but as it is, the Game Boy Color needed a snowboarding game, and Boarder Zone is a good inclusion to the genre.", "date": "Jan 13, 2000"}
