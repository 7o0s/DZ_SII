{"name": "NFL Blitz", "name_review": "NFL Blitz", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/09/12/nfl-blitz-3", "text": "Midway's NFL Blitz, originally designed for the arcades, is a blazing, intense and sometimes brutal football game that doesn't hesitate, stutter, or slow down long enough to let players catch up. The game is all about speed. It has arcade-feel written all over it. So when the big 'M' announced that it was porting the title to Nintendo 64 many football fans were understandably skeptical. After all, Blitz arcade is a tough cookie to beat, especially with its smooth framerate and crisp graphics. But we're here to tell you that you needn't be skeptical any longer. Blitz for Nintendo 64 is an undeniably brilliant football effort that is the perfect alternative to the likes of Madden or QB Club.   Before reading any further, know this: Blitz plays nothing like the competition. Emphasis is on action, not realism. If it's a full-scale football game equipped with all the miniscule details and strategy you seek then you might just want to wait for Madden or QB Club. That said, if you're looking for unsurpassed football intensity that just doesn't quit then you simply can't do any better than NFL Blitz.  The Facts  Full NFL Licensing. Arcade and Season gameplay modes. Running in medium-resolution mode. Play editor. Blitz 99 Arcade compatible. Two-player simultaneous. Full season stats, schedule and standings. Requires Controller Pak to save data. Rumble Pak compatible.   Gameplay Within a matter of seconds players can boot up Blitz and begin a game. Two minutes, and four touchdowns later, the game speeds along without a hitch. Realistic? Hardly. Fun? You better believe it.   Blitz features the full NFL licensing, which enables all the in-league goodies and athletes for the 98-99 football season. An added bonus considering the fact that Blitz doesn't even try to be a simulation football game. Players have the option of choosing between Arcade mode, a quick and easy single-match, or Season mode, which pits gamers at the beginning of a football season and lets them do their thing. All data can be saved to a Nintendo 64 Controller Pak.  From the opening kick-off it's easy to see that Blitz is not like other football games. Everything transpires so quickly and with such force that it's almost comical. Interceptions and fumbles are not only common, but an integral part of the game. Slamming tackles, bone-shattering sacks, leaping touchdowns, stiff-arms, spins  they're all in the game. Imagine hitting a receiver so hard that he flips into the air and then fumbles the ball, right before landing hard on the ground. Now imagine the defensive cornerback scoops up that ball and runs it all the way back to the 10 yard-line. But just as he's getting ready to score the winning six points along comes the opposing team and strips the ball from him. You've got yourself a typical play in NFL Blitz.  Blitz N64 plays identically to its arcade predecessor. Honestly, the two are virtually the same gaming experience, right down to the way the computer sometimes to gain a certain advantage when a player is winning. Cheating? Probably. Is that a flaw? Not necessarily, because in doing so it keeps the score close at all times, which makes the game that much more fun in the end.  And exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version of the game comes the highly touted play editor. Gamers can create and save their own plays to a Nintendo 64 Controller Pak and then use the data with Blitz 99 in the arcades. Brilliant idea. Let's hope it goes over well so that more games in the future implement similar features.   Blitz for Two NFL Blitz is absolutely going to waste unless it is played with a friend (of your choice, of course). The game controls so tight and intuitively that anybody can learn it in no time flat, even the videogame illiterate. And when two players are going at it late in the fourth quarter, a tie-game with little time to spare, gamers will appreciate Blitz's genius.  Graphics Surprisingly enough, Blitz for Nintendo 64 boasts some very impressive visuals with a smooth framerate. Player models are well-designed, detailed and animate wonderfully. The game runs in a crisp, medium-resolution mode and even surrounding stadiums look great. Midway nailed this one. Playing Devil's advocate, Blitz 64 admittedly doesn't look as good as the arcade version, but still, in a word: brilliant.  Sound What's this? A Midway game that actually sounds good? Can it be? It's true. Head-rattling hits are highlighted with exaggerated player ~umphs!~ and in-game commentary that can only be described as over-the-top.  I was pleasantly surprised with Midway's port of NFL Blitz to Nintendo 64. It plays just as fast and looks nearly as good as its arcade predecessor. There's the play-editor feature and the ability to use saved data with Blitz 99 in the arcade via Nintendo 64 Controller Pak. Midway executed this one perfectly. Well done. The biggest gripe I've got with the game is its sometimes ~cheesy~ AI, which rewards the computer when it is losing. Other than that, beautiful. Sit down with a friend and dig in  you'll be a believer in no time.", "date": "Sep 12, 1998"}
