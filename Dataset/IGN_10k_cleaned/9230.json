The warrior Jazeta, who quested for the magic medallions, defeated the evil Dirth and rescued the Princess Aurora one generation ago, has gone missing  just as wicked forces are once again on the rise. After a premonitory dream predicting your papa's impending peril, you hear from your mother that it's up to you  Jazeta's son  to take up sword and shield, find your father, and save the day. It's time for more actioning and adventuring. It's Neutopia II.   Now the first Neutopia game was a pretty shameless clone of Nintendo's Legend of Zelda, a fact made clear in its review from a month ago. And it holds true, here, that the sequel of a clone is still a clone  but it's definitely a more polished one. In playing Neutopia II, you're getting an experience that is very similar to its predecessor, but also that features a handful of nice, welcomed enhancements that make the game feel more accessible and a bit more modern.   The most obvious of these is Neutopia II's addition of diagonal movement. This is still an action/adventure seen from an overhead viewpoint, and the screen still scrolls around one ~square~ at a time. But moving from place to place is a lot less stiff now that Jazeta's son can move in eight directions, a skill his father never mastered. The simple power to run and attack on a slant is an excellent upgrade  still not the more fully free movement of a game like A Link to the Past, but much better than before.     And also improved is this sequel's storytelling and overall plot progression. The idea of a son setting out on a quest to rescue his dad isn't nearly as overdone as the more generic princess-has-been-kidnapped theme, and the interactions between your hero and other characters is a bit more diverse this time around. The items you'll go after in the underground labyrinths aren't part of a generic collection of medallions or Triforce pieces, but rather objects that play a role in advancing the storyline  a chalice that lets you advance through a lava-filled cavern, a healing herb that revives a sick princess, and the like.   But even for all of these enhancements, there's still a prickling feeling as you play Neutopia II (if you've played Neutopia 1 before it). And that's that it just doesn't feel quite different enough to be a real sequel. The diagonal movement is nice, the story improvements are all well and good. But still, it feels more like the same game as before with a few tweaks programmed in. Like it's really Neutopia 1.5, or Neutopia: Special Edition. You know the feeling if you're ever played other sequels that didn't really go far enough, or cover enough new ground.So the verdict on this sequel really ends up in about the same place as its predecessor. The final comment in the review of Neutopia 1 was that there was no Second Quest in that game, no remixed version of the adventure to play through after seeing the credits roll by. But maybe there was, after all, and it was just contained in a different game  Neutopia II feels like a remixed Second Quest of the original, with a few adjustments and enhancements thrown in to make controlling things feel easier. So it's just as worthy of your 600 Wii Points as before, and it's worth a download for players who experienced Neutopia 1 and wouldn't mind more of the same. I guess it's just a case of a son taking after his father.", "date": "Oct 13, 2007"}
