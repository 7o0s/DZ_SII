{"name": "Yu-Gi-Oh! Falsebound Kingdom", "name_review": "Yu-Gi-Oh", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/15/yu-gi-oh", "text": "is a departure from the card based nature of the Yu-Gi-Oh series. Unlike prior videogames based on this popular franchise, Falsebound isn't a straight conversion of the card game and cartoon show. Instead, Yu-Gi-Oh has been adapted into a RPG -- you guide your team of monsters in a traditional turn-based arena.   Why aren't the duel masters dealing out card based punishment? Well, Yugi and Kaiba were invited to the unveiling of a new dueling device. This apparatus creates a holographic program that inserts players into a fictional kingdom in the midst of civil turmoil. The player has to guide real monsters into battle instead of just playing cards. Is this new device going to revolutionize dueling? Kaiba, Yugi, and you are about to find out.   The Facts  The card based Yu-Gi-Oh! universe is transformed into a tactical RPG  Play as two different characters, each with their own story arc  Control a team of three monsters   Gameplay  Soon after activating the device, Kaiba and Yugi magically discover something has gone horribly wrong (there are some plot loopholes) -- they're now trapped within this kingdom. The two friends have no choice but to play the roles assigned to them and hope that by completing their mission they'll be able to escape. This whole ordeal is explained to you through cut scenes that belong on a Game Boy cartridge. Konami has done an excellent job of getting you charged up to play through this too long adventure with some stellar still shots of the characters accompanied by text you'll be scrolling through for ten minutes. Fortunately, the story isn't all that important to the game.    The excitement continues. Kaiba and Yugi follow different paths and storylines (they're separated when they enter the kingdom), but the gameplay is identical. Both learn that they're part of an elite core of fighters called marshals (essentially duelists). Since they have the innate monster control ability, the boys are forced to partake in the civil dispute.    Learning how to use your fighting force is a process of trial and error. The explanation in the manual isn't user friendly (which makes you think the game will be hard), but there isn't a tutorial (which makes you think that it'll be intuitive). The game is neither -- it isn't very hard, and it isn't intuitive. You'll spend far too much time searching for the non-existent, deep combat system, and all you'll find are simple options that do little to contribute to RPG or strategy elements.   Each marshal controls a trio of monsters. You're able to build your team from scratch, granted that you have unlocked monsters and have the points to use them, but early in the game there's very little you can customize. In a catch-22 twist, when you are finally able to customize your fighting force, you'll have little reason to because your monsters level up as they gain experience in battle. This isn't to say there aren't any reasons to alter the default settings -- each monster has its own ratings for attack, defense, speed, and hit points, some monsters can use certain items or have special abilities, monsters can be fused together to make more powerful beasts, and each monster has a compatibility rating that will give its stats a bonus if it matches that of the marshal. The only other factor you'll want to consider is that each monster is attributed a type, spirit, dragon, spellcaster, machine, warrior, beast, or darklands, but besides for knowing that some items won't affect certain monster types, these classes seem to carry little weight.    Yu-Gi-Oh! is known for its ~rock, paper, scissors,~ battle system, but Kingdom never mentions that an advantage is given to a certain monster class when fighting. A flying creature doesn't seem to hurt a land creature more than a water creature and machines don't dish out more damage to dragons.  Unless there's strategy hidden in Kingdom if you're familiar with the card game, there isn't a whole lot of depth to the fighting.   During battles, your only options are to attack, use special power, guard, use item, and wait. Unless your monster has a tome or other item that gives him a special skill, they won't be able to use the special attack. The normal attack is just that (there aren't any variations). So, unless you have a special power or you need to use a healing item, most battles only consist of choosing your target and hitting A. This makes for an extremely monotonous battle system.    It also occasionally gets confusing because you can win a battle without defeating anyone. Each monster has a set number of points to use during a fight (most actions cost one point). If you run out of points, you can't order your monsters around. So, if both parties run out of points and no one is killed then the win is attributed to whoever has the most points. It's confusing (and you're often wondering why you lost). It's a shame that Konami won't let you just finish battles, but if they did then they wouldn't have a reason to make you more frustrated.   Like a strategy RPG, you aren't only in battles. Each scenario has a different mission objective (as creative as take over town X and don't die). To order your troops (you have more than one marshal at your disposal), you click on a marshal and then move the cursor to where you want them to go. Once  your orders are placed, you have to wait for them to move to that location. This takes forever. The idea is that you'll encounter random skirmishes on your journeys to and fro, but you can go through five scenarios without encountering a random battle. Your boredom increases exponentially with each tedious, drawn out trek to your destination.    Is that a forest or a sea of mold? Once you get to a town, you'll get to do battle. If you meet up with enemy troops out side of a town, you simply have to defeat them. If you're besieging a town, then you'll have to wipeout the entire garrison. The same rules apply to you when you hold a settlement. To help defend your towns, you can build two defensive buildings. These serve various purposes, whether they'll attack ground troops or air, allow you to heal your monsters, or restock spent items, etc. The silly thing about the defensive equipment is that it doesn't really do anything. Sometimes it will fire on enemy troops, but usually they escape untouched.    While attacking a town, the aggressor will be forced to withdraw to the outskirts of the settlement if defeated in a battle. They're only dazed for about five seconds before they can attack again. The delay is theoretically there so that you can use your healing post to heal your units, but you don't have enough time to execute. Even if you're in the menu the battle will automatically start in about ten seconds.    Silly things like this make Falsebound frustrating. This could have been a decent game, but because of stripped down fighting elements and a lot of bad decisions like the over world map, forced delay, and the lack of any compelling reason to play it, Yu-Gi-Oh fails.     Graphics  Yu-Gi-Oh has a card line, cartoon, and manga -- so why not use it?. Why does Falsebound have no art direction? Nothing of the game's graphics, except for character avatars and monster designs is recognizable as Yu-Gi-Oh. The over world map is very barren -- you'll see grass or what looks like piles of mold growing on the grass (that are supposedly trees) adding exciting ~scenery~ to your tedious journeys to various towns. Textures are non-existent. The monsters don't look horrible, but they also don't look good.     What's almost a bigger affront on the eyes are the cuts censes. Why are they still pictures? They aren't even interesting. The opening ~cut scene~ makes you look at a picture of an office building for about ten minutes as you read through the text (you can't skip it). Trust me, forced clicking through long drawn out story telling isn't fun -- especially when it's presented in such a yawn worthy way. It's an odd decision, which when compounded with the in game graphics (and over all production values or lack thereof) make Falsebound look like a Nintendo 64 game. It's just ugly.   Sound  The sound is another of Kingdom's ~marvels.~ The musical score, which is what you'll hear the most of, isn't too bad. They score relies primarily on instrumental tunes that sound a like your average adventure or RPG game. Nothing really stands out too much. However, they did manage to either put in enough variety to the score or stream it in such a way that you don't notice looping.   Other sounds will be hard to find. Of course, there are the requisite clash, slash, and bubbling of attacks, but these sounds are recycled not only for each monster but a lot of monsters use the same sound bite.    Why they couldn't have at least accented the cut scenes with a voiceover will also remain a mystery.     Falsebound Kingdom feels like a game that no one cared about. I'm not sure what exactly Konami had in mind, but they failed to deliver a product that would appeal to most gamers. The fact that it's a kid's title might explain why the battle system is so minimalist and repetitive, but I don't know why kids would want to play it besides for the license. The game isn't fun, it doesn't require any form of strategy beyond knowing how to complete the objective, the production values are awful, and you spend the majority of it mindlessly pushing the same button repeatedly as you try not to fall asleep. You'd have to be a pretty devote Yu-Gi-Oh fan to play though Falsebound -- there's hardly any Yu-Gi-Oh in the game. Konami just shoved this title out the door, relying on rabid Yu-Gi-Oh fans that blindly buy anything Yugi to fuel sales of this title. Do yourself a favor, resist the urge to pull this off the shelf because you're going to be disappointed.", "date": "Nov 15, 2003"}
