Pokmon, easily Nintendo's biggest property ever to hit the Game Boy shows up again in a special edition for Pikachu fans. This game is essentially a re-issue of the two original Pokmon games (Red Edition and Blue Edition) that showed up in the US around this time last year. But a great game in another package is still a great game, and if you haven't been introduced to the game that started it all, Pokmon: Special Pikachu Edition is your best bet.Features Updated Pokmon adventure using the existing Pokmon Red/Blue engine New Pikachu-related elements Follows the cartoon story Game Boy Printer Support Works with Pokmon Red and Blue For Game Boy and Game Boy ColorIn case you haven't noticed it, there's a little craze going on in the world with these guys known as Pokmon. It doesn't matter if you love 'em, hate 'em, or drop-kick 'em, you've at least heard of them, and they're not going away anytime soon. Pokmon started, believe it or not (and you'll be amazed at how many people don't realize it) as a Game Boy RPG back in 1996, in Japan. After two incredibly successful years as a game, a TV show, and a huge merchandise license, the big wigs at Nintendo decided to bring these little guys to the US. And guess what? It caught on like a cold. And chances are, you've caught it as well.Here's the deal in Pokmon: you're a kid named Ash (which can be changed within the game, but for now, you'll be known as Ash), who dreams of being a Pokmon master. So, you leave home to fulfill your dream. You'll travel from town to town, defeating each town's Gym master with the Pokmon you've captured and trained, until you earn all the badges necessary to be considered a Pokmon Master.Pokmon is a very traditional oriented Japanese RPG  overhead view, super deformed characters, tile-based dungeons, random creature encounters...the works. The appeal of Pokmon, however, is the sheer amount of personality in the game. There are literally more than 150 Pokmon to uncover and capture, and your collection becomes a status symbol  how many Pokmon have you found? Or, more importantly, how many Pokmon have you captured?See, when you encounter a wild Pokmon, you must do battle with it  and the only way to do battle with a Pokmon is with another Pokmon. Each of the game's Pokmon has its own strength and weakness, its own attack and defense capabilities. All Pokmon belong to one of fifteen categories, and some types of Pokmon can utterly destroy Pokmon in other categories  Fire to Water, Water to Rock, and so on. It literally becomes a game of Rock/Paper/Scissors as you try and discover which Pokmon works best against others.And the Pokmon you've caught can be traded between your friends  in fact, that's the only real way you're going to be able to catch every single one. Just like Pokmon Red and Blue, there are about a dozen Pokmon you'll never be able to find in Yellow.Okay, so that's Pokmon in a nutshell. What does Pokmon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition bring to the table?First of all, the story of Pokmon Red and Blue has been altered slightly to mirror the cartoon. In Pokmon Red and Blue, you had your choice of three Pokmon at the start of the game. In Pokmon Yellow, Professor Oak captures and hands you Pikachu as your first Pokmon. Because Pikachu is a rather rare and powerful Pokmon in the game, Pokmon Yellow is slightly easier to play since battles are a lot easier to win  but during the first big battle with Brock, Pikachu is useless, so you're best to capture as many other Pokmon and train them before the first Badge battle. And like the cartoon, Pikachu doesn't like being housed in a Pokball  so he follows you around like a companion. He cannot be traded, or let go, and he will never evolve. You can check out how well you're treating your Pikachu by ~talking~ to it  this will bring up a window showing its mood. Take pride in knowing you're taking care of it.Because the game somewhat mirrors the cartoon, the graphics have been altered a bit. It's nothing major  Brock looks like Brock in the cartoon, and Jesse and James from Team Rocket now make an appearance. Other small tidbits have been added, like Jigglypuff showing up to sing the Jigglypuff song (putting Pikachu to sleep in the process).Speech has been added  when you use or talk to Pikachu, it'll say its trademark ~Pika!~ ~Pi!~ or ~Pikachu!~ in crappy, low quality digitized audio. It's obvious the existing game engine was never meant to have speech  and the sound quality shows.Game Boy Color support has been improved a bit, but it's still not the most colorful portable game out there. In Pokmon Red and Blue, when you played the game on a Game Boy Color each game had a blue or red hue throughout the adventure. In Pokmon Yellow, the color palette changes depending on what screen you're on -- battle sequences are slightly more colorful, and you'll notice the color change as you walk from town to town  the color switch is pretty obvious. Pokmon Yellow will most likely be the last game from Nintendo to not feature true Game Boy Color support.Finally, Pokmon Yellow features Game Boy Printer support so you can create stickers of the creatures you've seen or caught. Essentially, this is simply a screen dump of the Pokdex, including text that describes the Pokmon you printed out. It's not a big deal, but it's a cool little feature.There's a reason why Pokmon is so successful  it's an excellent game. The game isn't incredibly deep, but the incentive of catching new creatures for your personal collection is a strong enough force to get you going to the end. The game is super easy to pick up and play, yet it's challenging it its own right. And it's addictive.  After playing both Pokmon Red/Blue and then Yellow, I have to say that Pokmon Yellow is the best version to start out on the whole Pokmon craze.", "date": "Oct 20, 1999"}
