The game was among the early designs from Blizzard (then known as Silicon & Synapse), featuring well-designed racing and car combat game mechanics, as well as employing a soundtrack that recreated several familiar, licensed tunes in the limiting cartridge format. Like the company's previous game The Lost Vikings, Blizzard has brought back the design for the Game Boy Advance market. The portable rendition is a spot-on conversion with gameplay that still holds up today, and other than a couple of little elements that pop up in the port, it's a great, recommended combat racer on the handheld. Features Five locations, 10 tracks each Three difficulty levels Five vehicles Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance Rock 'n Roll Racing puts players in a futuristic combat environment where the only requirement is to not come in last place. The challenge is to work your way through four-vehicle races and come in first, second, or third through any means necessary...clean driving or vicious attacks. Each victory (and opponent destruction) nets players points and money. The cash can be used to upgrade the vehicles with more powerful weapons, armor, and speed boosts...or purchase better vehicles altogether. The earned points are used to ~buy~ your way into the higher, more challenging classes, and ultimately to the different tracks on other planets.  All of this racing action is accompanied by a licensed, classic rock soundtrack from Black Sabbath, George Thorogood, Steppenwolf, Deep Purple, and, of course, Henry Mancini's Peter Gunn theme...with commentary by the guy who popularized repetitive announcing at car shows: Larry ~Super Mouth~ Huffman. Rock 'n Roll Racing isn't an original racer by any means, but it's such a well put together design with an incredible amount of energy, both in its action and its soundtrack that it's hard not to enjoy the game. Though the game's difficulty starts out like a cakewalk, trying to beat the computer drones in the later levels becomes amazingly intense and challenging since they're absolutely ruthless in blasting out their weaponry.  The port, pulled off by Mass Media (the same team that worked on The Lost Vikings and currently in development on Blizzard's third GBA port: Blackthorne), is extremely close to the Super NES version. The Game Boy Advance version uses the same vehicle sprites and track tile sets as the console game, brightening them up and increasing the screen contrast slightly to compensate for the darker LCD screen. The soundtrack is also translated accurately, featuring the same kick-ass instrumental versions of the tunes, missing only the SNES' ability to offer a little more reverb to the audio.  Nothing has changed about the game design; the GBA version even features two-player racing through the link cable...which works better than on the SNES since the console version had to split up the screen to pull off the multiplayer. The view of the track is a little more limiting on the GBA than it was on the console version due to the lesser resolution on the handheld, but the programmers of the port put in a smart ~camera~ that keeps the car in the prime spot on screen.  The controls had to be reduced to the GBA's more limiting four-button layout, and in one case the control change can make for a hazardous accident: the R button shares both the ~sharp turn~ function as well as the ~power charge~ function.  If you're in the middle of turning, holding down the R button will make the vehicle take sharp turns more quickly...but if the D-pad is being used, it will activate either the boost or jump depending on what's been equipped to the vehicle. So, if you hit the R button before the turn in anticipation of a power-slide, it could activate an accidental leap...right off the edge of the track. Oops.   Though the game is based upon the same exact design of the Super NES game, the GBA game kicks the original's password save out with cartridge EEPROM and records the progress after each race. For some reason, though, this feature was thrown in half-assedly; players have six different slots to save their Rock 'n Roll Racing career, chosen at the start of the game. But the slot can't be named...instead, a used slot is simply recorded as ~DATA,~ so you'll just have to remember which DATA slot your save game is in. And it's unfortunate that, since the GBA game records to cartridge, Mass Media didn't find it important to record track times. This is a standard feature in racing games today, and even though the original SNES game didn't have a race clock, the GBA version should have gone one step further and included it. Even though this console racer is nearly a decade old, its design is still a classic. Mass Media kept in everything about the Super NES and recreated it on the GBA, sans password save. The game looks, sounds and plays almost exactly like the racer did on the SNES, and in most cases that's what we like. The game is incredibly fun and challenging, but if only the GBA team went one step further and recorded the best times on each track...", "date": "Jun 12, 2003"}
