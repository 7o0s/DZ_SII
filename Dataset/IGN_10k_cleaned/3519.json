Series creator Will Wright has always had a fascination with building things, and from that love, a simple yet brilliant urban design simulator was born in 1989 known as SimCity.  Instead of laying waste to modern civilization with firearms and hand grenades, Wright's PC software went against the grain by enticing players to be constructive and create their world -- with the occasional natural disaster tossed in for good measure.  This concept of turning players loose to design, customize, build, and interact with their virtual surroundings has captivated gamers ever since, and the success of the Sims franchise has spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs into other Sim territory.  We've seen everything from SimCopter to SimCoaster to SimMars and, yes, even SimAnt, of all things.  And the funny thing is, nearly all of these titles continue to keep us glued to our mice and keyboards with every new, zany Sim idea that's hatched.  The addiction continues in the 21st century with Maxis' latest addition to the Sims universe -- aptly named The Sims. Instead of building an entire city, colony, or other large-scale project, this newest, hottest PC series brings the focus down to a fine point, as players are now responsible for the health, happiness, and virtual success of a single person in this crazy Sim world.  It's up to the player to decide how their Sim will look, dress, behave, eat, exercise, work, play, and above all: love.  The Sims is about the closest thing that we mere mortals will ever get to playing God, and now Xbox owners are finally able to join the irreverent fun.  Features  Fully redesigned Sims gameplay -- now in 3D!  Create and fully customize your own Sim and bring him to life  Two single-player modes: Traditional ~Play the Sims~ mode and the brand-new story-driven ~Get a Life~ mode  Team up with a second player to compete in mini-games or live out your Sim lives together in split-screen harmony   For one to two players simultaneous  Gameplay Maxis went out on a limb when it decided to recreate The Sims' PC-centric gameplay for the home console crowd.  We typically prefer a good dual-analog, vibrating controller to the standard mouse and keyboard configuration, and Maxis knows it.  That's why the development company isn't simply porting its PC software straight to the current-gen systems; instead, the team went back to the drawing board and used the fundamental design principles of the PC version as the basis for redesigning much of the game from the dirt up.  Gone are the 2D sprites and isometric viewing angles, and instead, Maxis has brought The Sims to life in full, glorious, polygon-textured 3D bliss -- just the way we console gamers like it. Using the left thumbstick, players can pan and zoom the camera to their hearts' content and spy the reality-based action from just about any angle.      Other instantly recognizable changes from the PC version include a brand-new ~Get a Life~ mode, where gameplay actually follows a mission/objective structure and, for the first time ever in a Sims title, players can ~win the game.~  Maxis was very wise to not only include this new single-player story mode, but also spotlight it as the title's primary gameplay experience.  When you boot-up the game, you'll be weaned directly into creating your new character, giving him (or her) a name, slapping an outfit on his back, and immediately acting as his personal guide through your upcoming adventure in reality.  In comparison to the open-ended gameplay of the PC versions, this new console-only Sims mode offers a much more focused and challenging experience, albeit one that will eventually come to an end.  Diving into this beefy campaign, players immediately learn that their first mission is to earn 800 bucks and move out of their mom's house.  At the end of their quest awaits riches beyond their wildest dreams, but they've got to earn them first.  Gameplay is broken down into six levels with multiple objectives for each that help to keep players focused on performing specific activities to meet their ultimate goal of becoming a mansion-clad pimp daddy.  Environment interaction is handled with an easily visible, yellow, on-screen cursor and a press of the A button.  Everything is context sensitive, so clicking on a phone will give appropriate actions such as ~call,~ ~answer,~ or both depending on whether it's ringing or not.  The typical Sim's home is littered with many little interesting objects to click on and interact with, and the interface control is handled quite smoothly and never frustrates.      Once players get the hang of clicking around, they'll soon be tempted to snoop the entire house and see what kind of trouble they can get themselves into.  Clicking on a broken television set will get the poor Sim electrically fried to a crisp, and attempting to cook before he skims the cookbook will result in a visit by the fire department as the kitchen goes up in flames.  For those hoping to finish the ~Get a Life~ mode anytime soon, they'll have to stay focused on their current goals and get things done in the right order.  The game plays like a juggling jigsaw puzzle, where players must keep multiple things going at once and exercise careful balance while simultaneously solving the puzzle of how best to complete each objective.  For example, one of the more common objectives will require players earn a promotion in their career.  The game doesn't really get into the details of how best to accomplish the task; instead, some good old-fashioned common sense mixed with a dose of trial and error will put their characters on the fast track.  Players must carefully monitor status bars for things such as bladder, hunger, energy, and hygiene to keep their Sim happy, in addition to building relationships with other non-playable characters in the game by talking to them, telling them a joke, etc.  If their character is happy, well liked, and meets various other key criteria the day he steps out the door to catch his ride to work, then the promotion is in the bag.  If he's tired, hungry, and stinks like a rat, then they'll have to wait until he gets home before feeding, bathing, and forcing him to take a nap in time for the following day's shift.  Depending what job the Sim holds, other important factors begin to weigh in such as exercise or technical knowledge.  Each of these categories can be improved in his free time at home, but while one meter goes up, other meters inevitably go down and simultaneously create an alternate need.  It's this constant juggling of priorities that is a big part of what makes the game so addictive and ultimately so much fun.  There's a lot to manage in your Sim's household, and you'll often have to be quick on your fingers to get everything done before the alarm clock rings and its time for work again.  Thankfully, holding the L trigger will freeze time and allow the player to continue issuing commands to their character, so the game can really be played as slowly as necessary.  While some players might spend an entire day on a single level, others might cruise right through by getting all the goals checked off right away.      In addition to the wonderful new ~Get a Life~ mode, gamers can also choose to go the more traditional PC route in the ~Play the Sims~ mode.  Here, a character is created and dropped in the Sims universe with no objectives or story, only a broad, open-ended goal to achieve whatever kind of success the player might desire -- be it wealth or just a crazy collection of rock guitars.  The game is packed with a huge assortment of diverse, creative, and often-comical items for players to collect, buy, sell, and arrange in their homes, and most can be interacted with in some way or another.  Even something as simple as turning on a lamp will improve the mood of the player in that room -- that's how insanely detailed this game can be.  But Maxis didn't draw the line at an addicting single-player experience. The Sims is just as much fun for two people as it is for one.  Both can team-up in the ~Play the Sims~ mode to live out their virtual lives in the same household -- be it in harmony or the chaos resulting in arguments over who has clean up the rotting messes left on the kitchen floor.  There's even a mode where the two players can compete against each other in scenarios such as ~win the most friends at the party~ or ~borrow the most money from strangers.~  Grab a friend and prepare to laugh your booty off as you attempt to steal friends from each other and typically get slapped in the face instead.  Each of these multiplayer modes keep the core gameplay goodness of the single-player experience fully intact and tosses in that unpredictable human element for a Sims session that can often be even more fun and comical than going it alone in the story mode.    Graphics Thanks to its new 3D facelift, The Sims is brought to life in a way never before seen by gamers.  Development of this new console title originated on Sony's PlayStation 2, and as Maxis now brings the game to the Xbox, there are a few noticeable graphical enhancements in the process.  For starters, both feature a much smoother and sharper anti-aliased look than the PS2 title, which helps greatly in recognizing things like the tiny symbols in word bubbles that appear over a character's head whenever his bladder is bursting.  The other big upgrade is the texture resolution, which has been noticeably improved to provide less dithering on the large landscapes and objects in the game.  If you haven't yet snagged the PS2 version, then these visual improvements alone are reason enough to grab it now.  But despite the upgrades, the game still carries with it a few graphical shortcomings in general.  Although character animations are smooth and realistic, they often repeat unnaturally and robotically when certain events transpire.  Players will occasionally witness their characters sit down to eat, then stand up when they're finished, walk away, walk back over to their chairs, sit down, pick up their plates, and then stand back up and carry it over to the sink for washing.  And while the texture resolution is definitely improved, they're looks fairly muddy when the camera pulls in close to the action.  Perhaps the biggest eyesore is the occasionally stuttering framerate that skips a beat here and there during dramatic camera movements through a densely populated house or when the disc fires off a quick load of data.  But none of these flaws are severely drastic, nor will they hamper your highly enjoyable time with The Sims. For those graphical connoisseurs in the house, they will catch their eye, but there's still plenty of detail in this new console Sims title to draw gamers into their world.    Sound Considering how many unique objects that Maxis has packed into the game, one might suspect that it would skimp in the audio department and attempt to reuse many of the same sounds wherever it could.  But thankfully, the development team didn't go down that road and has instead packed the disc with tons of diverse and crystal clear audio effects ranging from squeaky wooden floors to funky radio tunes, bubbling water, and crickets chirping in the evening lawn.  The game definitely comes to life in all of its subtle audio touches. There isn't much gameplay music to distract from the effects, which is a very good thing; players will eventually begin to rely on audio clues just as much as some of the visual ones when trying to assess the needs of their Sim and the state of their household.  The best way to track down a pile of garbage is to always listen for the nearby swarming buzz of flies, and a Sim's mood can often be discerned through the tone of his garbled ~Simlish~ language.  These excellent audio elements in The Sims get the job done in a style that's both top quality and entertaining -- a commendable job by Maxis. Some games definitely aren't for everyone, but the vast majority of the videogame-loving world is going to adore playing The Sims.  There's no doubt about it -- the game is humorous, charming, and very addictive one you figure out how to please your Sim and take care of business.  Some gamers might feel that forcing their character to drain his or her bladder is just too tedious, but I say that those gamers are missing out on a chance to allow their Sim to soil their pants and make a nice little wet spot on the kitchen floor, whereby a second player can join the fun and kindly mop it up.Yes, it's a strange, sick world in which we live, and thankfully, The Sims has fully recreated it -- for better or for the worse.  Let your Sim sleep through his alarm clock, and you'll lose your job, lose your cash flow, and be forced to pawn your fancy pool table that all your friends love.  Oh, and then you'll lose your friends.  If that pattern of living hits a little too close to home in the real world, then we fully recommend picking up The Sims and giving your life a second try.", "date": "Mar 24, 2003"}
