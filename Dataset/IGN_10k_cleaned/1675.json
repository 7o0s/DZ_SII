{"name": "Vanishing Point", "name_review": "Vanishing Point", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/21/vanishing-point", "text": "As kids, I'm sure there were times when your parents forced you to do something that you hated, but you learned to appreciate and even like when you grew up.  Being Asian (if you didn't figure out that ~Chau~ is an Asian last name), it is a parental mandate that I started to practice piano after I turned 7.  While other kids were playing outside and getting in all sorts of trouble, I was stuck practicing the repetitive Hanon piano exercises for hours on end.  As torturous as it sounds and as much as I despised every moment of playing stupid minuets and sonatas, now I thank my parents for making me practice piano (it's a great way to woo the chicks).  On a much shorter time frame, I had the same experience with Vanishing Point for the Dreamcast.  You see, when I first started playing Vanishing Point I had a hard time enjoying the game.  Actually, I really hated it due to the frustrating control of the two cars you start off with: Ford Mustang Cobra and the Ford Explorer.  These are the only two vehicles you have to pick from initially, and I doubt the real-life version vehicles control as shoddy as they do in VP.  Floaty doesn't begin to describe the way both vehicles handle; it's as if you're constantly trying to steer on oil slick while zooming at 100 mph.  The game sports some nifty collision physics most of the time -- however, sometimes when you hit a car or road obstruction, you'll flip and careen in the oddest ways.  Combine the suspect collision physics with the control problems of the two cars, and mix it with the challenging AI drivers that seem to hit their brakes when they're right in front of your car, and I almost gave up on this game.  If I did, I would have ended the review right here, calling Vanishing Point a great looking game that controls horribly and isn't worth all the frustration.  That's not to say that Vanishing Point wasn't worth looking at.  On the contrary, VP is one damn fast driving game and I have yet to see the game slow down from its scorching 60 fps framerate.  With high-resolution visuals to boot, this game sports a very similar graphic style to Ridge Racer - even the buildings and bridges seem to have been borrowed from past Ridge Racer games.  Great smoke effects from power sliding and that neato trailing brake light effect seen in Ridge Racer IV give this game a very slick look.  And the trancey music in this game is much to my liking as it gets your head bobbin' when you're taking those crazy turns.  Still, as much as I wanted to keep playing the game because of the excellent visuals and sound, I was on the verge of hurling my Dreamcast controller out of the building.   But being the dedicated worker that I am, I decided to give the game one last shot, and after numerous third place finishes in my heat, I finally got a first place ranking (You have to finish FIRST if you want to progress).  Vanishing Point isn't about racing other vehicles, though there are plenty other cars racing simultaneously.  The goal of each track is to beat the time limit; for every few seconds you're over that limit you drop in placement ranking.  All tracks are on public roads, so not only do you have to contend with rival racers trying to beat the time limit, but you also have to deal with the slow-ass Sunday drivers.  So, after numerous collisions from a miss-timed turn or a civilian driver that decides to stop right in front of me, I finally got first place and finished my fifth heat.  Each time you finish a race (in either Arcade or Tournament mode) you'll unlock something new, whether it's a new track, car, or even options.  At this moment, I had unlocked the Alpha Romeo sports car (I unlocked a pretty lame movie and a Ford truck previously).  Taking it out for a spin, I found the new car to control MUCH better -- and after a few more races, I had unlocked an option to tune the abilities of your cars.  With this new option, I was finally able to drive the first two cars with the proper control and feel that should have been implemented in the first place.  Though I do understand that the developers wanted to reward those guys who had to deal with the default vehicles with some excellent bonus modes (and there's a lot of them), I really feel they should have made the tune-up option available from the start. It would have alleviated a lot of stress and frustration that might turn off many potential racing fanatics. Vanishing Point has a whole lot of options and goodies to unlock, but there are some great modes to begin with.  The Stunt Driver mode allows you to perform cool jumps, fishtails, and other crazy tricks that show off the excellent physics engine.  Playing against another player is a treat as the framerate remains as a rock-solid 60 fps.  Finally, there are the online features and while the game doesn't sport head-to-head racing online, you can get online and compete in various changing challenge.  Complete these changes with outstanding skill and you may be placed on the public rankings along with other players. Vanishing Point has everything going for it: sound, music, visuals, and lots of options and extras.  As I said above, had they included the tune-up option at the very beginning of the game, it would have made it a lot easier to progress and much more enjoyable.  Instead, you have to deal with the bad controls of the first few vehicles, and if you're patient enough to endure a few hours of slippery control, you'll definitely appreciate and like Vanishing Point.  --Anthony ~Chromatic Scales Suck~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 21, 2000"}
