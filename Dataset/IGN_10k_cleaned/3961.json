Keeping with the tradition of the game, this expansion uses the storyline that the new adventure areas have suddenly been discovered. However, rather than tacking on a new zone with new portals, Sony decided to breath some life into its original continents, which have become ghost towns for some time now.   With this release, Sony also continued a few of its old tricks. Lost Dungeons of Norrath is designed for groups and only groups. They've been hell bent on killing solo players for a while now. There will be no power leveling or soloing in these dungeons, or twinking other characters with gear purchased from Lost Dungeons of Norrath adventure points. More on that later.   They also introduced a few new ideas, some long overdue, some great, and some awful. We'll get into them all.   The Storyline  The game introduces the Wayfarer's Brotherhood, the NPCs involved in the game. You start by entering the home city of your character's race. If, like a lot of my friends, you have been a bad boy/girl and can't go home, there is a neutral NPC in West Karana or Lake Rathe who can help you. You'll get a message saying who to find and where to look. You have a brief conversation with that NPC, then have to find a Wayfarer at one of five camps.   The camps are in Eastern Commons, Everfrost Peaks, North Ro, South Ro and Butcherblock. These zones have been dead as doornails for years, really. Nice of Sony to put them to good use.   At the camp, you approach the Wayfarer, who asks you several questions. The answers came in your conversation in the home city. Once that's done, you get an Adventurer's Stone. This allows you to accept missions and more importantly, use the teleporters.    Each Wayfarer camp has an NPC with the name Magus over their head. Approach them and say the name of the Wayfarer camp zone you want to visit. For example, saying 'Butcherblock' at any of the other camps will transport you to the Butcherblock camp. The Stone will also gain stats as you successfully complete missions.   Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept  You need to form a group of at least four people to accept a mission. Once you have one, the group leader can approach the adventure merchant to get a mission. There are four types of missions:   Assassinate: Kill a specific boss mob. The target will spawn when 60 percent of the mobs in the dungeon are killed.    Collect: Get X number of items from mob corpses, such as teeth.    Rescue: Find an NPC, clear an exit path for them and guide back to the entrance.  NPC won't leave until 60 percent of the mobs in the dungeon are killed    Lay Waste: Kill X number of enemy mobs.   A new feature to this is that you have a time limit. You have 30 minutes to get to the dungeon, then 90 minutes to finish it. This is a first, as EverQuest has never gone the time limit route before, and it serves as an incentive to haul ass.   You are then sent to the dungeon, which is in the zone one or two zones away. It breaks down like so:   Everfrost camp -> Mirugal's Menagerie in Everfrost  Butcherblock Mountains -> Mistmoore's Catacombs in Lesser Faydark   South Ro -> Deepest Guk in Innothule Swamp or Upper Guk   North Ro -> Takish' Hiz in Oasis   East Commonlands -> Rujarkian Hills in North Ro and Oasis     Each zone has several dungeons each. For example, Deepest Guk consists of eight separate dungeons: The Cauldron of Lost Souls, The Drowning Crypt, The Ancient Aqueducts, The Mushroom Grove, The Foreboding Prison, The Chapel of the Witnesses, The Root Garden, The Accursed Sanctuary. All of the other dungeons are like this as well. All told, Lost Dungeons of Norrath has 48 new dungeons, the most of any EQ expansion.    Unique Designs  Now here's where Sony's programmers earned their salary. The dungeon adjusts the monster level for the average level of the six in the party. A group of level 30 adventurers and a group of level 65 adventurers can accept the exact same adventurers in the same dungeon, but the mobs will be dark blue to both teams. So no more set dungeon levels.   Even better is that when your party enters the dungeon, a separate instance of that dungeon is created and it's all yours. No one else but your group can enter the dungeon. When your mission ends, the dungeon is wiped out and the resources reclaimed on Sony's servers (I hope).    The time limits were put in so Sony could kill the dungeon instances and avoid creating too much server lag. As a regular player on a cable modem, I can tell you they still have a major lag problem. People report taking minutes to zone instead of seconds, and I can't remember my last Lost Dungeons of Norrath adventure that didn't have at least one linkdeath. As good as Sony did in designing this, the inherent popularity of the dungeons means lots of instances being created, and the lag level server-wide is murder.   One nice thing about Lost Dungeons of Norrath dungeons is the monsters don't respawn. Because triggers take place when the population drops to 60 percent, the dungeon can't be respawning, obviously. It would also be murder on resources. Plus, it wouldn't be fair. You have to fight your way through in a certain amount of time, and backtracking through respawns wouldn't be fair at all.   The dungeon designs are amazing. Sony keeps getting better at level design with each expansion release and this one is no different. Likewise, the monster models are beautiful, as are some of the weapons they drop. Plus, Sony introduced a new skeleton model that's a major improvement over the old one.   Once in the dungeons, you better have an enchanter because you will get a lot of pulls, as mobs are pretty close. They hit pretty hard, 250 to 350 damage. At level 65, experience is comparable to a tier one PoP zone, like the Plane of Innovation.   Sony made inanimate objects a little more interesting. Nine times out of ten they are empty but occasional things like a chest or hollow tree contain an item. Chests are often locked, and here's where rogues become useful. They can pick the lock, or a priest class can remove a curse on the chest. Whatever you do, don't whack it open. People who do that give us clerics (level 65, 53AA for me) heart failure.   The game does make things easy for you. First, when you enter a zone with the dungeon where your mission takes place, a line will appear in your on-screen compass. Just line that line up and follow it straight to the entrance. Second, if you are on a rescue or kill a boss mob mission, you start to ~hear noises~ from a certain direction, so it leads you to your target.   Because time is of the essence, casters have to be very efficient in how they manage their mana. You better not call a med break unless you are seriously hurting for mana. This is where the good players are separated from the bad.   To make things more fun, Sony allows the group leader to adjust the level of difficulty of the mission. It defaults to regular difficulty, but you can also make it easier or harder. That in turn reflects on your experience gained and points gained at the end. I've been told by some of the best players on the server that playing on hard skill is just that: very hard.     If you fail your mission due to time, you can still finish it and get a partial credit. If you wipe out and all die, then it's game over. Your corpse will be deposited outside the entrance of the dungeon if the group wipes out, so your corpse won't poof with the dungeon.    Points, Drops and Augmentations  Successful completion means you gain points. Those points can be redeemed like Green Stamps for items. The more points you accumulate, the nicer an item you can buy. These items are nodrop, so you can't buy them for someone else.    Plus, they aren't transferable between camps. Points gained in South Ro won't get you anything from an Everfrost merchant. So you have to go on adventures at every camp, and you've got to go on a lot of missions per camp before the good stuff shows up, since it's invisible to you if you can't afford it.   There are also dungeon drops. For starters, they drop an insane amount of platinum, up to 20pp per mob. I've finished missions with more than 1k in platinum. Plus, they drop lots of gems, junk weapons, and they drop equipment and augmentations. Equipment dropping in dungeons isn't nodrop, so you can trade it, sell it, do what you like.   Augmentations are one of the nicest ideas in the expansion. There are different types of augmentations. You can augment an item to add all manner of stats to it. Increase your strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc., your saving throws, your mana, your hit points, and other personal stats.    What really makes things sweet is that every item in your inventory has one augmentation slot. Some people were fearing that only equipment found in Lost Dungeons of Norrath could be augmented, but Sony went back and made every item in the game augmentable. This means people can give themselves a major league upgrade without changing out their equipment. You can have much higher stats with the same gear thanks to augmentations.   Augmentations are available as both purchases from merchants with points, or drops in dungeons. Like everything else, they are nodrop.   The Ugly  No good idea doesn't come with a bad idea. Some of Lost Dungeons of Norrath's ideas aren't so good, and the nature of the beast has caused some problems.   The worst idea is the scoreboard/leaderboard. You can see who on the server has the most wins and their win/loss record. This has led to people acting like idiots, such as quitting out on their group if it seems they will lose because they don't want to take the loss. It's driving players nuts to be ditched when the going gets tough. Sony doesn't plan to drop it since the leaderboard shows only the top 100, so eventually the best players will rise to the top and losers are filtered out.   Because of the time limit, people are getting reckless and trying to hurry. The result is they overlook the crowd control element. I never thought I'd ever see enchanters go hurting for groups but they are being left out in a big way, at least on my server. People just want to chain pull and kill as fast as possible. Necros, on the other hand, are finally feeling some love. With so many dungeons full of undead, they are finding some new use.     I'm not too keen on the non-transferable points, either, because what you often get are people looking for a raid in one zone, and won't come to another. They want to get enough points in their particular zone to buy an item requiring a lot of adventure points. So that's kind of limiting.Lost Dungeons of Norrath is a nice change in direction for EverQuest. It's not simply raising the level of the mobs, adding even tougher ones than the last expansion. Every zone in this expansion is being used, as opposed to Luclin, where you had three useful zones (Ssra Temple, Paludal Caverns, Vex Thal) and the rest are empty. It adds new elements that are standard fare in most RPGs, like locked chests, which gets something new out of the player base.It benefits high level and low level players alike. I've noticed the top guilds on my server are playing Lost Dungeons of Norrath adventures, usually on hard skill to challenge themselves, while taking turns in the Plane of Time. Our top guilds on Quellious have an agreement to rotate through the planes, so they can take turns rather than fight over spawns. In between their turns, Butcherblock and South Ro is full of people from Explicit and Lotus Cult.At the same time, people leveling up are also doing adventures. What would you rather do at level 35, go to the Dreadlands, sit in a camp while one person pulls one victim at a time and sit and fight, or go on run-and-gun adventures in dungeons where you get decent drops and augmentations, and get much better experience? So people are forgoing the usual experience grind in favor of adventures to level up their characters.", "date": "Sep 26, 2003"}
