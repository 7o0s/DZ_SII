Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/21/gitaroo-man-lives-review-2", "text": "Aside from being one of the few games that can proudly say it has a Japanese lady reciting its title in almost exactly the same way a sex noise sounds, Gitaroo Man has the pleasure of being possibly the finest non-peripheral reliant rhythm action game ever made.   With that accolade out the way, onto Gitaroo Man Lives! What we have here is, essentially, not-very-much-more-than-a-PSP-port of the 2002 PS2 classic. As such, anyone's who's smashed their way through the pain barrier of gnarled and bloodied digits offered by the original's frightening 'Master' difficulty mode can probably skip to the end.   If you've not yet joined the Church of Gitaroo Man however, some explanation as to what exactly makes the game so utterly joyous might be in order. As rhythm action aficionados know, most entries in the genre live or die by their presentation and musical roster - two areas where Gitaroo Man succeeds in such huge dollops of quality it doesn't really seem fair on other games in the genre.    Story-wise, Gitaroo Man sees shy, retiring loser U-1 hurled awkwardly into the role of reluctant, guitar-wielding saviour of the universe. Everything else is a bit redundant, largely thanks to the game's utterly bonkers sensibilities. Told through gloriously stylised sequences, packed full of charm and character, it's one of those titles so off-kilter you'll either love or hate it from the get-go. If axe-wielding showdowns with nappy-clad demons, reggae robots and a half-Elvis, half-bee trumpeter sound like your kind of things, then welcome to Guitar Man. As far as the soundtrack goes then, it's all wonderfully diverse guitar-lead brilliance, covering genres as wide as hi-energy J-pop, disco and thrash metal. All of it's as catchy as hell and one of Gitaroo Man's most endearing features.   Of course, all that spit and polish wouldn't mean a damn if the game didn't play well. Thankfully though, Gitaroo Man's greatest achievement is its rhythm action mechanics, which are easy enough to pick up but deep enough to prevent that all-too-quick on-set of tedium generally found in its genre brethren.    Throughout the adventure, you're tasked with performing two types of action, depending on the level. Firstly, the game uses the PSP's analogue stick to mimic the sweeping pitch shifts and wailing of your guitar. A constantly shifting line passes through the centre of the screen and it's up to you to make sure the on-screen arrow remains within its boundries at all times. As simplistic as that sounds, it goes a long way to making you feel like you're actually responsible for the music you're hearing - a basic conceit generally lacking in most rhythm action titles. As you waver and miss your mark, the accompanying screeches and twangs are more than enough to make you want to up your game.   Secondly, certain musical segments demand you watch the screen closely and hit the corresponding face button as icons whiz from top, bottom, left or right toward the centre of the screen. As always, the closer to the middle - thus, on beat - you are, the more points you wrack up. Interestingly, Gitaroo Man pros are likely to find these sections much tougher than they remember on the PS2 - the main culprit being the PSP's elongated screen. While previously, it was possible to focus on the edges of the screen and memorise sequences as they advanced toward the centre, the PSP's widescreen ratio means that icons originating from the top or bottom appear much later than their horizontal counterparts - even if they're first in sequence. It's not a major issue, but certainly likely to frustrate old-timers.     This is especially true given that accuracy is so paramount in Gitaroo Man, thanks to the game's somewhat unique structure. You'll begin a round by charging your on-screen gauge - the more precise you are initially, the higher it will climb. As the level progresses, every mistake you make causes your gauge to deplete - empty it before the song's over and things come to a premature end.   Although both parts are easy enough to get to grips with, Koei doesn't shy away from keeping the challenge ramped up. With barely a few stages under its belt, the game starts throwing up sequences that range from the thumb-straining to the eye-searing. Take the infamous shark chase level: unless you've really been honing your skills during the proceeding four stages, its button-only rampage of complex beat sequences is likely to leave you a juddering mess of your former self. The fact that Gitaroo Man keeps an eye on your progress and constantly switches out segments for more difficult variations as you improve is both a stroke of genius if you're cruising through and an absolute nightmare if you're fluking it.    It's testament to the game's design that Gitaroo Man remains challenging yet satisfying throughout - if you're prepared to put in the work. Of course, its brilliantly irreverent background antics and fantastic music roster help provide more than enough incentive to keep pushing on. Quite how long the game will last you though is anyone's guess - newcomers can expect to put in anything from a solid number of hours to a good number of weeks, depending how quickly they get to grips with things. However, disappointingly, anyone that's already completed the PS2 version can easily soar through Gitaroo Man's normal mode in a few slender hours.   This is where things get a bit tricky. You see, there's very little here (aside from the undeniable quality of the game itself) to entice old hands back. Other than an all-too-brief multiplayer 'Duet' mode featuring two new songs, Gitaroo Man offers practically nothing over its PS2 predecessor in terms of content. Sure, there's now the option to listen to unlocked tracks and watch cut-scenes in Jukebox and Theater respectively, but it's a real shame Koei didn't take its time to offer some genuinely satisfying additions.    As far as the port itself goes, its two thumbs up from us - both in-game graphics and their pre-rendered cut-scene counterparts look sharper than ever on the PSP's diminutive screen. Even that age-old PSP bugbear, loading times, don't pose much of a problem - expect a twenty to thirty second thumb twiddle prior to levels and that's it. What's more, we're thrilled to see that Koei's included the option to pause mid-level and resume precisely where you left off - previously any interruptions meant a return to the begining of a level.So, cards on table time: is Gitaroo Man Lives! worth your cash? Well, anyone with even a passing interest in rhythm action titles who missed out on PS2 original simply owes it to themselves to pick up one of the finest games the genre has ever produced. However, unless you're a complete Gitaroo Man die-hard with an itching for portability that simply must be satiated, the lack of decent extras means you might want to think twice before forking out for essentially the same game a second time around.", "date": "Aug 21, 2006"}
