Following the purchase of mobile maker JAMDAT, the firm applied the Madden branding and trimmings to JAMDAT's superlative football game making it the genuine top football game for the smallest screen. The 2008 edition of Madden for mobile builds on past successes but offers a few new features that make it an absolute must-download for football fans gritting their teeth until the first kickoff of the season.   This review is strictly for the 3D edition of Madden NFL 08. There is indeed a 2D edition available for lower end handsets, but this review is based on the 3D game developed by Firemint. I used two handsets to test Madden NFL 08, too: LG's VX8100 and VX8600.   At first glance, Madden NFL 08 appears to be a pretty straight successor to last year's game. The general appearance is largely similar (although, that is no slight). The playbook is still a breeze to navigate, making it easy to select passing plays or defensives maneuvers from the real deal Madden playbook. You can still choose just a quick exhibition game or launch into a season.   The biggest difference is the implementation of Field Vision Passing, a feature that makes the game much more accessible to the newcomer or casual mobile gamer. After selecting a passing play, you no longer need to fumble around with the bottom tier of keys on the number pad to pick an open receiver. Now, you press OK when you're ready to throw. This makes a series of arrows appear over the receivers' heads. A green arrow means the receiver is completely open. Red means there's no chance the pass will be completed. Yellow pretty much means you're taking your chances if you launch the ball. After pressing the thumb pad the same direction as the arrow marking the desired receiver, the ball sails through the air. If you wait too long to throw the ball, you will be sacked.   This is a great addition to Madden NFL 08. The previous system worked fine, but as mentioned, this is a welcome olive branch to the casual gamer.   The rest of the game, such as defense, is entirely functional. I always enjoy being on offensive much more, throwing out stiff-arms as I plow down the field, but switching players and making tackles is very manageable. Not easy, mind you, but manageable.   EA Mobile has the full NFL license at its disposal, so the game is loaded with real world teams and players. You can play the role of NFL deity, messing around with team rosters by trading and substituting players. I think a lot of gamers might gloss over this feature (I am certainly a more casual football fan myself), but the hardcore pigskinner could find a lot of pleasure perfecting the league.   The game looks solid, although I found the game played a little smoother on the 8100 than the 8600. The framerate (a word I'm sure EA is tired of hearing discussed regarding their console editions of Madden NFL 08) stuttered more on the 8600. The animations are solid. The sound is pretty good, due to digitized crowd and field effects. There is digitized commentary, although its repeats itself quite often. Madden was determined to let me know just how important it is to deal with what defense gives me. Several times. During the same game.  Madden NFL 08 is a solid improvement over last year's edition, which was certainly no slouch on the field. The new passing controls are fantastic and will be appreciated by anybody new or returning to the series. The rest of the production is good, from the sound effects to the ability to monkey around with the stats and rosters. If you're a football fan, this is a definite download.", "date": "Aug 22, 2007"}
