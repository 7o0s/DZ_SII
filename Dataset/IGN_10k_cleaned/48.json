It's a bit of a homecoming for the team, both because they've been focused on the PlayStation hardware for the past couple of years, but also because Nintendo is where they got their home console start  with this game, Super Turrican. If you've only ever experienced Factor 5's later work, you're in for a treat here. This action/shooter is addictive, intense and loud, and proved that the F5 team was worthy of being handed major projects and licenses like Star Wars.   Super Turrican is something of a cross between Contra and Metroid, as you command a soldier in a robotic suit and guide him through a series of side-scrolling levels filled with plenty of baddies to blast. It takes after Contra in its arsenal of available weapons, as your Turrican soldier can wield straight-shooting lasers, spreadshot machine guns, rifles that fire ricocheting bullets that bounce all over the place and more. It takes after Metroid in its free-roaming style of design, as each level has a defined beginning and end but it's also open and explorable. Not too linear.    Also, you can roll up into a ball like Samus.    Turrican soldiers hate to build snowmen.  But Super Turrican has a few of its own innovations to go alongside those elements borrowed from other titles  one interesting one is the lightning beam. This long, constant stream of energy can be fired out at any time and then ~swept~ in an arc across the screen. You hold down the beam's button to keep the stream flowing, then press Left or Right on the D-Pad to send it rotating in a circle. Enemies hit by the beam are frozen for a moment, during which time you can switch back to your primary weapon and finish them off.   Annoyingly, though, only the lightning beam can be fired in any direction  the standard guns are always locked in sideways position like the old Mega Man games. This can be frustrating to deal with, as it seems out of place. Both Super Metroid and Contra III: The Alien Wars  Super Turrican's closest contemporaries on the SNES  allowed you to at least fire at a 45 degree angle into the air. Turrican doesn't, so you'll be leaping up and down a lot to get your targets into range.   Factor 5 fans from more recent hardware generations are certainly familiar with the company's dedication to pushing each system's boundaries in graphics and sound, and Super Turrican does both. The amount of action and ammunition on screen at any one time is impressive, even when compared to other over-the-top shooters from the 16-bit age, and the soundtrack here is nearly unmatched in the back catalog of the Super NES. The game's music is rich, engaging and perfectly exploits what the SNES had to offer  it even features Dolby Surround sound support. That was unheard of back in 1993, but sure enough, Factor 5 pulled it off.Nintendo thought highly enough of Super Turrican that it released by itself on March 3, unaccompanied by any other additions to the Wii Shop that day. And though it's disappointing for some who'd ask for more quantity on the Virtual Console, there's no denying the quality of what we did receive. Super Turrican is a great experience, one that served to establish of firm foundation for Factor 5 as developers of home console video game software. It's a blast to play, as it expertly balances paying homage to other popular action designs with its own innovations and mechanics. And it pushed the envelope of what the Super Nintendo hardware could accomplish now over a decade and a half ago. 800 Wii Points is an easy price to pay for a game this good  and luckily, there should be more where this one came from. Super Turrican 2 is also a likely future release for the Virtual Console, as is the Genesis installment of the franchise, Mega Turrican.", "date": "Mar 18, 2008"}
