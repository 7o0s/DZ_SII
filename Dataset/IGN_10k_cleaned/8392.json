After enjoying wide acclaim, the inevitable sequel arrived the following year, in Bonk's Revenge.  Improving on numerous facets of the original, Bonk's Revenge boasts better graphics and sound, and more challenging gameplay.  Some were disappointed after having downloaded Bonk's Adventure and not finding anything particularly redeeming about the title.  This sequel, however, is back with a vengeance and offers gamers a quaint, humorous, and charming adventure through pre-history that will satisfy long time fans and newcomers alike.   The treacherous King Drool III has snatched half of the moon and it is up to Bonk to retrieve it and save Princess Za before it is too late.  Bonk knows not the power of the flamethrower or even the Billy club; rather, he'll smash enemies into submission with his generously endowed forehead.  Pressing A causes Bonk to jump and then pressing B thereafter will force him head first into the ground, shaking the earth and devastating nearby enemies.          While not airborne, simply pressing B inflicts Bonk's trademark headbutt which is just as satisfying as ever.  Tapping B rapidly while in the air allows Bonk to hover and more accurately land his jumps.  The simple controls are highly responsive and allow players to navigate the game's seven multi-staged worlds and boss fights, not to mention the copious number of bonus stages along the way.   Unlike its predecessor, Bonk's Revenge won't allow players to rip right through levels with ease.  There are a great number of enemies, as well as more intricately designed layouts that force the player to backtrack.  Because of the greater number of foes, the designers have implemented stronger powerups and frequent opportunities to recuperate health.  By eating a small slab of meat ~Nuclear Bonk~ emerges and upon smashing the ground freezes all the enemies on screen.  By eating another small piece of meat while Nuclear Bonk, or eating a large slab on its own, ~Butthead Bonk~ appears on the scene.  Yes, his head does in fact turn into a huge butt, which breathes fire, and when spinning, destroys most surrounding enemies.    Graphically, the game showcases the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-16 quite well, employing large, bright, and colorful worlds to explore.  The enemies are carefully detailed and animated, and designs such as Butthead Bonk exemplify the game's quirkiness.  The backgrounds are beautiful and immerse the player in Bonk's land.  While the sound effects are nothing special, the game's musical score is an excellent complement to the artistic direction of the game, and the aforementioned immersion factor.  If there's one major gripe to be had, it's that the game is a little short, and can be completed in a couple sittings (about 2-3 hours).Perhaps a traditional 2D platformer at heart, Bonk sets itself apart from the Marios and Sonics out there by making players laugh at the ridiculousness of it all, while still employing rewarding gameplay in exotic locales.  If you were a fan of the original, then you'll definitely find a lot of fun to be had here.  If you haven't played Bonk's Adventure, but are looking for a fun platformer with a twist, the game is well worth the 600 points.", "date": "Apr 20, 2007"}
