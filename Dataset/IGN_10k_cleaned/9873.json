It can be good for some mindless fun, but each game seems to lack polish, contain some pretty annoying bugs, and feel generally rushed overall.  As a spin-off from the DW brand, Koei has also put some time into developing another era of button-mashing entertainment in the Samurai Warriors world.  Take it even one step further, and the company has now created a spin-off Wii title based on that world, with Samurai Warriors: Katana exclusively for Nintendo Wii.   We'll be totally frank right off the bat, and say that Katana isn't a great game by any means.  If you've been following Wii pretty heavily since launch you've already seen screens and video of Katana in action  it was that random first-person sword fighter that looked a little like the Dynasty Warriors franchise, and a little like DQ Swords.  Interesting enough, this is also where a ton of the music for the Wii video montages came from during big keynotes at E3 and the like.  Kill him with swinging death!  So what are you really getting with Samurai Warriors: Katana?  Basically it's a first-person ~Warriors~ game, having some guilty pleasure in mindless combat, while also containing its fair share of bugs, and an overall lack of polish.  If you put a group of Wii gamers in a room together and had them brainstorm, and then put every idea into one game with no filter whatsoever, you'd have Katana.  You aim your sword slashes with the IR, press A to swipe, do nine-way motion attacking (vertical, horizontal, diagonal, and stab motions) for additional attacks, and use the B trigger for distance attacks such as bows and guns.   And when we say the game is a mix of tons of different concepts, we aren't kidding.  Rather than sticking with one core design, Katana splits gameplay up a ton from level to level.  Some are essentially light gun levels, having the camera auto-drive as you are taken from start to end point, stopping for combat.  Others have you stationary or moving, allowing for analog control to turn your character, and even others have you using the stick once again for full movement throughout the battlefield.  Once you add in all the equipment upgrades, eight different weapons (with specific controls and supers), items, inventory management, and skill leveling for your character you can start to see just how deep of an experience Katana really is.   In fact, the fault doesn't lie within the game's diversity  even Nintendo's own Link's Crossbow Training is constantly in flux  but with the lack of polish that came from it.  Just like the previous ~Warriors~ games before it, Katana is really, really rough, so while the gameplay all works, the visuals are downright pitiful, the game has a tremendous amount of bugs, and almost no polish at all.  We're often fighting characters that are stuck running in place, or reading mission objectives that are done with very minimal translation work (things that make my writing look like Mark Twain, which is sick).  The interface is a bit on the sloppy side, the VO can be extremely rough and amateurish, and things as simple as the on-screen targeting reticule look like first pass art.  For a game that is basically an interactive first-person Disney World ride, it looks way under par.    With that being said, there's still some fun to be had with Katana, though we do need to warn you that it is entirely a guilty pleasure.  It can be fun kicking the crap out of the same five or six character models for hours on end.  It can also be fun pairing melee and distance attacks together, using different weapons to poke holes in the defenses of enemies, and getting into multi-step boss battles that easily trump the sword fighting in things like Red Steel.  The item management, upgrades, and weapon building is simple, but it all works, with items assigned to the d-pad (a max of four), and the ability to use gold to ~forge~ new weapons from previous ones, or upgrade your actual stats as you progress.  It is by no means RPG-like depth, but it does feel like a simplified character-building mechanic paired with light gun and motion melee combat, and it can be fun.  For those concerned with the length of the product, there's a main story mode made up of four unique chapters (each of which take about three hours to complete), a trial mode which contains more arcade-geared gameplay, and a two player vs. split screen mode if you've got an extra Wii-mote/nunchuk pair handy.  Samurai Warriors: Katana has a ton of potential on Wii, and we think of this first entry as a decent proof of concept for what we hope becomes a deeper, more polished experience in the future.  Well admit that we were skeptical with this one, as Koeis Dynasty Warriors (and Samurai Warriors, by extension) franchise isnt known for its polish, and the final product could have been a total failure if proper care wasnt put into it.  In the end, Katana brings forth a ton of great gameplay ideas, but in an attempt to deliver too many concepts it ends up being very buggy and unreliable throughout.  Character A.I. is almost non-existent, the amount of enemy models is staggeringly small (tons of clones to be found), bosses are re-used, and the general gameplay ends up boiling down to mashing A and B, and occasionally swinging the Wii remote.  At the same time, theres some fun to be had here, and theres no denying that with more attention to detail, pride in the visual presentation, and more focused design the Katana series could evolve into something truly unique on Wii.  Knowing that this is most-certainly the first of many games in the series, and taking into account the full $50 price point ($30 is far more realistic, and $20 would be even better) well encourage you to pass on this one, and wait for the inevitable sequel.  Its a decent rental, and an interesting product to hunt for in bargain bins later down the line; nothing more.", "date": "Jan 18, 2008"}
