{"name": "WarGames: DEFCON 1", "name_review": "WarGames", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/19/wargames", "text": "Back in the early eighties Matthew Broderick starred in a movie called WarGames, about a high school computer whiz who broke into mainframe computers and almost tripped off World War III. The seminal hacker flick, it contained everything from war dialers, acoustic couplers and a sentient NORAD computer called WOPR. And that's about all you need to know about the movie to play the game.  Little hyped, MGM Interactive's WarGames looks at first glance like a groaner--another real-time strategy game with a dubious Hollywood movie license to boot (anyone remember Waterworld the computer game?) Well, admittedly the movie tie-in is rather tenuous, but the game itself is well executed, does most everything it sets out to do quite well, and breaks some genuinely fresh ground in the otherwise well-worn turf of the real-time genre.  The computer game takes place about twenty years after the events in the movie. World War III did happen; the WOPR computer is on the rampage, building up an army of robotic tanks and android troopers, and it's up to you and the forces of NORAD to stop its bid for global domination. That's for the first 15 missions; the other 15 let you play as the WOPR army.  The game looks sharp. Like Dark Omen and Myth, the battlefield is in 3D with a zooming, rotating camera that lets you get an overview on the forces. But unlike Dark Omen and Myth, here you do build bases and gather resources to build new units, which adds tactical importance to the landscape. You don't however gather resources off the map like a C&C or Warcraft--instead you start with a certain dollar amount, and gather more by sending special agents into neutral computer buildings and siphoning off more cash.  The interface is quick and easy to pick up, and effective enough in controlling the action. There are a few minor annoyances, such as when you try to left click on a new unit with a different unit highlighted, causing the two to interact. But overall, it's fairly clean.  The units are varied enough. Air and sea units are introduced gradually, so the player isn't overwhelmed with too many options, but instead learns the capability of each unit before moving on to the next campaign. The graphics are sharp and support a healthy array of 3D accelerators, but the game plays well enough in software that those without won't miss too much. The maps themselves are well done, with rolling terrain and a realistic look that lends the game a bit of real-time war game feel.  Actually managing units in the middle of a battle is the heart of a real-time strategy game, and WarGames has enough to keep a player busy without overwhelming them. Pathfinding is a little problematic, which is hardly unusual for games of this type, but annoying nonetheless. The sides are fairly evenly matched and there aren't many exotic units of the type you'll find in Red Alert, so combat is a bit predictable and a little bland. The missions are somewhat predictable too, in that in general you'll have just enough resources and forces to accomplish the mission by doing certain things in a certain order. Though this predictability sounds like a negative, it actually gives the player a better tactical understanding of what is going to happen, and so rewards the players who split their forces, set ambushes, or otherwise try to think their way through a battle rather than relying on a blunt force tank rush.  And though fifteen missions may seem a little short for each side, they are increasingly ever more difficult and require slow, careful play to succeed, meaning the game does include a fair amount of replay value.  There is no skirmish mode, as there was with Red Alert and Starcraft, but multiplayer is free over the Mplayer service, meaning finding other WarGame-rs for a grudge match shouldn't be too hard.  -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 19, 1998"}
