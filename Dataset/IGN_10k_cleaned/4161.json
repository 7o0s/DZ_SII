{"name": "Mario Kart: Double Dash!!", "name_review": "Mario Kart: Double Dash!!", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/11/mario-kart-double-dash-2", "text": "1992 brought the world of videogames a whole new phenomenon: addictive, arcade-style racing with some of the industry's most identifiable characters. It was Nintendo's Super Mario Kart for the SNES console, and it redefined what you could do with the racing genre. With its then-impressive Mode 7 visuals, clever level designs, and deep multiplayer hooks, the franchise went on to be often imitated but never duplicated. It is still regarded as one of the best videogames ever created by many, including the editors here at IGN.   Within five years Nintendo was ready to kick off the 3D revolution, which brought us the N64 and, naturally, a successor to the great SNES racer: Mario Kart 64. It brought the franchise into 3D and heated up the multiplayer circuit with four-player support. It was something new and, although not perfect, it delivered most of what fans were looking for. It went on to great success, and is still one of the top-selling racers of all-time.   As far as home consoles go, we haven't seen our beloved Mario Kart in over a half-decade. Apparently Nintendo wanted to hold off on any sequels until it had hardware powerful enough to deliver a true upgrade; and so Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is being ushered in this holiday season, exclusively for GameCube. It features a definite visual upgrade, a few new gameplay modes to boot, and LAN support in place of full-blown online functionality.    With the GameCube in dire need of top-tier software, we have been counting on it to revive the legendary franchise with new vigor and bring the console yet another surefire reason to be owned by all self-respecting gamers. However, this is not quite the case. Double Dash!! is an assuredly fun multiplayer racer that only makes small gameplay advances over the already-3D Mario Kart 64. Truly, it is a more graphically impressive version than its predecessor, but it is also a simpler one in some respects, proving that Nintendo still believes a more complex game is not necessarily a more entertaining one.    Those intentions may be good at heart, but the end result in Double Dash!! is second-rate. It's the kind of cookie-cutter sequel that Nintendo said it didn't want to create. This applies more to the hardcore fans of the series, though. Those that have played little of the franchise or those too young to remember it will find it to be a solid multiplayer title. It is, in fact, a fantastic title for the younger crowd. As well, despite our nostalgic disappointments, it's still one of the best kart racers available and one of GameCube's better exclusive offerings this holiday season.   The FactsBased on the hit-selling Mario Kart 64  Nearly 20 mascot characters: Mario, Waluigi, Peach, Bowser, Wario, and many more  Two-player per kart dynamic: switch to hold more items than before  Character-specific power-ups; Yoshi rolls his egg, Wario can toss bombs, and the whole cast has new tricks  Several modes of gameplay: Grand Prix, Time Trials, and Battle  Save multiple ghosts per track  Multiplayer mayhem -- one to four-player Battles and regular races; plus, two-player cooperative support for Grand Prix!  LAN play lets you use the Broadband Adapter to link two to eight GameCubes on separate TVs  Supports Logitech steering wheel controller  Progressive scan supported  Pro Logic II enabled  No widescreen  Rated E for ~Everyone~Gameplay  Nintendo's initial inspiration for the Mario Kart series has not come far. Gameplay consists of several modes, both single and multiplayer oriented. The Grand Prix is the main component of single-player racing, and it offers up three main cups plus a special cup that you are able to unlock. It's very basic and follows the same design structure as previous Mario Karts. On the one hand this is a good thing because players are instantly familiar with it, but on the other hand it does nothing new for single-player. In fact, Grand Prix is far more enjoyable if you grab a friend and take advantage of its two-player functionality.   Power slides are a must if you want to win.  The elements that are new to the series come mostly in the form of control mechanics. Double Dash!! controls a fair bit different than its predecessors. While there are eight people on the screen, there are actually sixteen characters; you have to control two people on each kart and there are a few strategic changes because of this. Firstly, you must choose characters based on their size. This affects the kart you'll be allowed to use, and the karts you use have different ability ratings of speed, acceleration, and weight. There's not a whole lot to figuring it out. If you use, say, Bowser's kart you will have serious top speed but your acceleration is limited and your weight will make turning more difficult. Bear in mind that the weight of your players really doesn't affect anything -- it's just that your kart will always have to fit the bigger one of the two. Picking Bowser and Baby Luigi won't save you any handling versus if you were to go with a Bowser-DK combo instead.     So, because of the available karts, choosing characters inadvertently affects your performance on the track. The real idea behind all the character selection and the two-person karts is more related to item usage. Every character pair (e.g. Mario and Luigi, Peach and Daisy, Bowser and Baby Bowser) has a special item type. So if you pick Mario and Luigi, who are basically the same character, you're only going to be able to gain a row of fireballs as your special item pickup. However, if you were to pick Mario and Bowser, you'd have access both the fireballs and a huge, seven-ton-size spiked shell -- and because you only have a chance to pick up these special items if you are sitting in back, you have to constantly manage seating by tapping the Z-button. Both characters can carry an item (they have to be seated in back to pick one up) which is yet another reason you have to constantly manage seating. This is perhaps the most thrilling new addition to the series; it adds new complexity to the control scheme, causing you to constantly strategize placement of your characters on your kart.    This element is about the only real advancement the series has made, unfortunately. Track designs, on the whole, are crude and uninteresting, serving up more style than actual substance. There are a few shortcuts in each, and these are the only true solaces for skilled players. They often require having a mushroom handy for a speed burst over a chasm, or in one of our favorite instances riding up the thin, arched railing of a bridge.    On a more positive note, tracks do take advantage of the way your skidding, power boost is designed. The first cup is well-balanced and lets you get used to your power slide, while later cups feature sharp turns or a series of bends that you can maximize speed through your power slide. Power slides are still handled the same way as they were in MK64: just begin a slide with L or R and tilt the analog stick back and forth slowly to charge it up. Controls, too, have been tightened. Unlike MK64, the karts handle heavier, turning is not as erratic and this means you have to use power slides as much as possible to cut sharp corners. Once you get used to it, the control are very likable and intuitive.   This better compatibility with the casual gamer is nice, but simplifying the gameplay has serious repercussions to the Mario Kart fans. You pick up double the items over tracks that haven't increased much in size. This makes placing first in races very random and more left to chance. There is no real way to defend against a lighting bolt or the deadly first-place-seeking blue shell. This makes 150cc circuits and multiplayer very frustrating, since the best driver in the world can drop from first to a latter place if a few nasty items are played (not that this is a new thing to Mario Kart, but the more frequent item pickup exaggerates it). The use of the ghost item is gone, too, which further removes the balance. To steal items you'll need to use the speed boost and crash into opponents; while this is fun it doesn't quite work the same way as the ghost item. When you climb rank in Double Dash!!, you will only get green shells, fake item boxes, and bananas -- they won't protect you against the items last place opponents get, like lighting.   The hop maneuver has also been removed, which was a highpoint of the control mechanics that previous Mario Karts offered. With MK64 you could find depth hidden under what seemed to be a simple, arcade racing shell, but Double Dash!! lacks that complexity. It's very straightforward; instead of expanding upon what impressed before, it has diluted the overall gameplay in favor of simplicity.    There are a few cool shortcuts to be found.  Yet another building block of the single-player, Grand Prix experience is the progression of unlockable content. It has been laid out in a very matter-of-fact, conventional style. Grand Prix is broken up into 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc for difficulty, and by beating each of the individual cups and earning a gold trophy, you will garner new karts (for the bulk of it), only a few new characters, a few battle levels, and new track circuits. We've already mentioned there is a fourth cup, which holds four of the most difficult tracks, but beyond this you can unlock a mix-style cup that puts you through a lengthy hour-long tournament over all the tracks.    Don't think of any of this talk as a spoiler, so much as a warning; Double Dash's reward system is predictable and mediocre. Nintendo released the mega-sized Super Smash Bros. Melee at the dawn of GameCube's life in 2001, but two years later we find Double Dash shares very little of the ideals set forth at that time. You won't unlock different costumes for riders, skins for karts are non-existent, and the number of playable characters, while commendable, increases very little over the five to 10 hours required to beat all the cups. For example, after completing the fourth major cup in 150cc (and all cups before it) with gold trophies the only thing we unlocked was a fifth cup, which is simply a random, 16-track compilation of the cups before it. No other reward was offered -- not even a new kart at that point. So we completed that mega, 16-track cup on 50cc (as every other cup on 50cc unlocked something). What did we get for our 45 minutes of playtime? Nothing. Only the message that it would take a higher CC-rated cup to be rewarded.   DK Mountain is a track that requires actual skill -- Double Dash needed more of these.  In short, if you're thinking of getting Mario Kart: Double Dash!! for single-player value, definitely consider that it only offers up the average amount of rewards and modes. We would have really liked to see a story mode like F-Zero GX had to increase single-player value. To help remedy this you are still allowed to play Grand Prix with two-players via split-screen, and for that we're thankful. It makes the experience all the more likeable when you get a friend into the mix, and this speaks volumes. Double Dash!! is a multiplayer title through-and-through. If you have a lack of friends, whether it's due to your hideous complexion or general disgruntled nature, you have few reasons to own it.    Multiplayer  The majority of people that have played the MK franchise know that it's not designed to be a solitary experience. Double Dash!! shines the most in the multiplayer department. There is no Grand Prix cup title for more than two-players, but versus racing is by far the most addictive and replay worthy mode for a large crowd. You have access to all the tracks, the power-ups, and everything holds up in the technical department -- no slowdown to be seen, which is one of the title's best traits. Thanks to the new control mechanics, it's not identical to the experience that MK64 offered up, but at the same time it's also not completely fresh. Veteran fans will definitely get a kick out of versus racing, but it doesn't have the longevity of its predecessors because it's just more of the same. Options are pretty limited, too -- you can't even do true team racing. Your best alternative is the all-new cooperative mode, which lets two people ride on a single kart and duke it out against another two people on a kart. It is more of a novelty than anything else, meant to increase the chaos of multiplayer by making you yell at your copilot to effectively switch seats or take shortcuts. Given the lack of mode variety, it's still nice to have around.   Then there's the Battle mode. A few of us here at IGN lived on the Battle mode from the previous versions; using our feather to hop amidst the Mode 7 worlds of Super Mario Kart, racing frantically across narrow bridges on the two-tiered Block City of Mario Kart 64 -- they are fond memories from our gaming past. As a result, we approached Battle Mode excitedly. It now has three different modes of play: Balloon Battle, Shine Thief, and Bob-omb Blast. The two latter -- new to the series -- fit perfectly and feel as though they should have been there from the beginning. Shine Thief, a variation on keep away, is a stirring little bout when you have four people on board. Bob-omb Blast is completely insane. It's definitely our favorite new mode, as it offers up total mayhem. The object is to essentially blow others up, but not get blown up yourself. This means matches can last seconds or many minutes.    Interesting level design? You decide.  Overall, Battle mode has the makings of greatness, but it misses the mark in speed and that puts a considerable dent in the fun factor. The karts are slowed down to accommodate the smaller arenas. This would be understandable, but the arena designs are so simple and utilitarian that it becomes a problem. You must rely on your power slide constantly to increase your speed in these relatively square, lifeless battle courts. All the cleverness that arose from the feather item in Super Mario Kart and the multi-tiered designs of MK64 is gone. You will unlock a few Battle levels that are larger, but as a multiplayer-heavy title, players really need access to them from the get-go.    In the end, Nintendo's efforts to simplify instead of innovate devalues the multiplayer experience. For the IGN office, the most played and enjoyed mode by far was versus racing over the full-blown tracks. If you're into racing versus style, this is pretty much the one mode aside from Grand Prix two-player that makes Mario Kart: Double Dash!! worth owning. Battle mode is a nice break now and then, but it just isn't addictive and frantic as it once was.   LAN Play  If you've been following the creation of Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, you probably know by now that it lacks true online support. Sega's Phantasy Star Online is still the only title to offer such functionality. However, Nintendo has included network play as an alternative. You can link up to eight GameCubes over eight TVs and play with eight people, or as many as 16 if you indulge in the cooperative mode over eight different televisions.   By kicking the system into LAN mode, you will find a new menu page that allows you to setup the match types and options before the game. Then you just press start and you're on your way -- load times and syncing up are very quick.   The only problem with LAN is the flexibility of setup. You aren't given the option to select your characters -- even with as little as two people on seperate TVs. Also users should be aware that split-screen four-player over LAN will only offer up 30 frames per second action, as opposed to the 60 you'll see if you play on a single TV.    As a whole, it's a nice but rudimentary addition; one that will be enjoyed by a small majority of those who pick up Double Dash!!, no less. It's also extremely hard to find Broadband adapters in stores, which might make it difficult for consumers to support the feature.    So, while it's an appreciated inclusion, it's still mostly lackluster, especially when you compare it to the massive advances companies like Microsoft are making in the online arena with titles like the 16-player, voice chat friendly Crimson Skies.     Graphics  The visual category is the one that Mario Kart has seen the most improvement. Gone are the days of 320x240 resolution with repetitive textures, sprite characters and world objects, and 15 frames per second gameplay. Double Dash!! runs at a slick 60 frames per second -- both in single-player and four-player split-screen. The latter is the biggest accomplishment of all, as the transition from one screen to four is seamless. The sense of speed is also perfectly kept in tact thanks to the engine's split-screen prowess.   In terms of technology, it seems that Nintendo shared some of the lessons learned with the Super Mario Sunshine team. Double Dash!! is one of the most vivid, coloring-book bright titles we've seen on GameCube yet. You won't find any other title in the world that looks like it. It could use to be more detailed, however; from the lower polygon counts to the average texture work, Double Dash!! only gets the job done. It's nothing to go drooling over or to prove to your friends that GameCube can perform technically, but it's also very easy on the eyes. It suffices.   Along with the strong framerate, the mascot racer also supports progressive scan. If you own a TV that supports it the result is a very crisp display thanks to the vibrant color palette. No widescreen support, unfortunately.    Sound  Sticking with its Saturday morning cartoon styled roots, Nintendo's music for Double Dash!! is a stupefyingly giddy compilation of simple MIDI scores. If you're looking for Koji Kondo and his orchestras, or anything that might resemble studio sound recordings, go back to Smash Bros. Melee. The new MK has reasonable, themed songs for each of its courses -- much like it always has -- but there's nothing impressive here. In fact, the older crowd -- those that enjoyed previous Mario Kart titles -- may want to turn it down a few notches. The only catch is you don't have separate control over sound effects and the soundtrack, so there's no offing it completely.   Speaking of sound effects, they are also just sufficient. There are a few clever sayings from each of the characters, celebration quotes and the like, but you won't be blown away. No much production has been put into this area.    A neat idea for a track, but it's just a square arena -- no real design to it.  Surround sound, for those interested, is supported with Dolby Pro Logic II. It is surprisingly clear and well separated. And, it comes in quite handy. There is no ~look back~ button so you often have to rely on the map and accompanying sound effects to figure out if someone is coming up on your tail.Fellow GameCube and Mario Kart fans, I know what you're thinking. That we've taken too harsh a look at this beloved franchise, which has always been about good, simple fun. But Nintendo itself has said it is a company that innovates and is a company that does not want to deliver cookie-cutter sequels. Unfortunately, that's just what Double Dash!! is. It's good, clean multiplayer fun but it doesn't progress far beyond the N64 version other than in the visual department. In fact, it introduces new imbalances to the item system and has axed a few trusted control mechanics like the hop.The franchise continues to be stellar kids title -- and I highly recommend this one to parents searching for the perfect GCN title for their young ones. Few better you will find.For the older audience and the hardcore devotees to the series, you will almost definitely find an experience very similar to Mario Kart 64, and perhaps something less than that. It's a more simply designed racer, and while that's okay for a new audience of children, it does little for the millions of hardcore fans that have grown up. The production values put into Mario Kart: Double Dash are extremely disappointing; honestly, do we really need two item buttons (X and Y) instead of dedicating one of them to a look-behind function? Having played a title like SSX 3, which redefines what you can do with arcade racers -- how much you can offer the players -- I feel like Mario Kart: Double Dash is missing so much. I expected so much more than this ho-hum effort. I had hoped for deeper controls, more than one selectable costume, skins for the karts, maybe GBA link-up support, more intriguing level designs, more characters, much more high-quality music -- the list goes on. I mean, it's still an enjoyable game, but not on the level it could have been.So, think about Double Dash before shelling out your much-needed holiday cash. If you've got a ton of friends that are into the title, you stand to enjoy multiplayer -- but even that may get old faster than you'd like. Double Dash is still a good one to add to the library of GCN exclusives, but with Battle not what it used to be, versus racing is probably where you'll spend the most time.I only hope that Nintendo pours more production into the sequel and remembers that just because Mario Kart was once designed for the younger crowd, doesn't mean it can't become an everyone title with some complexity to it.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
