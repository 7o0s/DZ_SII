{"name": "Bushido Blade 2", "name_review": "Bushido Blade 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/29/bushido-blade-2", "text": "Released last year, Bushido Blade marked a high water point for innovation in the fighting genre. It was a game featuring no time limit, no life bars, and one where one solid blow of the sword would mean certain death. Realism was king. Now a year later, Square has released its sequel, and things have changed a bit.   Whereas the original had three attack buttons there are now two, there's no longer a parry button, nearly all of the characters now have secondary weapons, and there are less attacks. Visually the game has changed as well. Character models are now more detailed, but with this comes the inevitable drop in background visibility.  The basics remain unaltered: there's still a link-up mode for two players (each gets their own screen for a first person fight), and play modes include story, versus CPU, and training. As before, each of these can be played from a first-person perspective complete with your character represented in wireframe. In story mode this time around, you'll fight generic ninja characters in between battles against major characters.  There are six main characters selectable at the outset, with 12 support characters waiting in the wings. At certain points during the game, a support character will jump in for you to control, and if you can keep them alive they'll be added to your character roster.  That's the game in a nutshell. How did it fare?What happened here? The original Bushido Blade was a masterful extension of the fighting game category, requiring more skill and boasting more innovation than any fighter I'd played before. Sequels are expected to better their predecessor, but in this case it's taken a notable step backwards.Control has been dumbed-down dramatically, there are fewer useful attacks, and it simply doesn't convey the sense of progression you'd expect from a good sequel. Moreover, while the characters are more detailed, the game pays the price in terms of visibility within the fighting environments. Parts of the backgrounds pop in so badly at points that I found myself falling off ledges or backing into corners that I couldn't even tell were there.Where there should have been an even more realistic game, I instead ended up with something that's more like Budokan on Genesis. In fact, this should have been the original game instead of a sequel, as Bushido Blade was far more advanced.It's not the worst fighting game by any means, but I was expecting a lot more. Fans of the original will no doubt want to stick with what they've got. If you found Bushido Blade too difficult for your tastes, however, this might be right up your alley.", "date": "Oct 29, 1998"}
