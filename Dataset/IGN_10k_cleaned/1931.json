Your survival was always threatened and your time was always limited, by both your skill and the amount of money in your pocket.  Knowing that you could only keep feeding quarters down the slot so long, and that the deep voice proclaiming your dire need of food would eventually announce your death, was what made the game exciting.  Removing that sense of urgency removes a good-sized chunk of the game's appeal.  And that's what home versions of Gauntlet have always done.  It's the same when you play an arcade machine on freeplay, which is an experience I've enjoyed a couple of times -- with the limitations of time and money removed, you really are just running around killing things.  That's fun for a little while, but it's not something you'd want to spend a lengthy game session doing (the success of Diablo notwithstanding).  The Gauntlet Legends series, to its credit, has done its best to add more to the Gauntlet experience than running and killing.  The latest installment, Dark Legacy, includes new characters, tons of special magic items, well-done level scripting, and character-development elements adapted from the arcade versions.  But it's still missing the excitement conveyed by the arcade games, and that's a problem that will always afflict console Gauntlet.  Gameplay  This is Gauntlet.  If you're not yet familiar with how Gauntlet plays, please proceed directly to the foot of the class.  But seriously, Dark Legacy is like its predecessors, a four-player action game with a few puzzle-solving elements thrown in to liven things up.  You pick a character from eight default classes (with several more classes unlockable later on) and charge about a series of levels killing monsters, grabbing keys, eating food, opening doors, collecting treasure, and avoiding Death (both as a proper and common noun).  The pace is quick and combat strategy relatively simple.  Dark Legacy, admittedly, is the deepest Gauntlet yet.  Most would agree, though, that such a statement does not say very much.  The game's combination attack and magic systems are a far cry from the simplicity of the old arcade Gauntlets, and its levels are much more complex, but while the means may have grown more complex, the end is always the same: kill everything there is to kill.  Different environments, new enemies, a huge collection of attacks, it still makes the game a variation on a familiar theme.  As Gauntlet always has been, Dark Legacy is far better as a multiplayer game than it is by yourself.  Alone, it grows extremely mindless extremely quickly, while with three friends and a multitap it makes for a pretty entertaining party game -- everybody can grab different colors and characters, and there's still plenty of targets to go around..  It doesn't equal the experience slamming a huge stack of quarters down an arcade machine with the same friends (especially if you throw in lots of Coke and a few frames of bowling in between games), but a console can only do so much for you.  Graphics  If Dark Legacy does not look markedly improved on PlayStation 2, then the arcade version I saw some time ago wasn't nearly finished, because the framerate is now far better than what I remember.  The PS2 version is about as clean as you could ask, only slowing down in particularly messy four-player battles when magical attacks go off.  The animation and effects are up to the arcade standard, a little choppy at times (because they're modeled that way, not because of framerate difficulties) but bright and varied like the first Gauntlet Legends.  Dark Legacy has a distinctly humorous bent in comparison to the first game, too, with goofier character designs and accompanying mutated magic spells.  It used to be you just tossed out your potion and the bad guys exploded -- now giant spiked wheels roll over them, or they're squashed by phantom Doink-esque joybuzzer hands.  Between the ordinary magic and the turbo attacks, each character type has several different silly magic attacks, which is a more interesting reason to use multiple characters than just their basic statistical differences.   This is one of those PS2 games, though, like Unreal Tournament, that improves more markedly than usual through an S-video connection.  The small characters and environment details tend to get unpleasantly muddied when played through composite video, making the game look worse than it deserves to.  S-video separates the patchwork of garish colors into a clearer and cleaner overall package.  Sound  The voice.  It all comes back to the voice.  The voice in Gauntlet is one of gaming's enduring myths, and it still cracks me up to hear it.  ~USE KEYS TO OPEN DOORS AND CHESTS.~  ~BLUE JESTER IS ABOUT TO DIE.~ ~RED DWARF NEEDS FOOD BADLY.~  What is it about the voice that makes it such marvelous fun?  I have no idea.  Other than the voice, though, there's not an awful lot to listen to in Dark Legacy.  The musical accompaniment is pretty bare, sometimes limited to minimal ambient sounds, and the sound effects are as in Legends -- whacks, grunts, crunches, explosions, etc.  They do their job, but they're rarely inspiring, and the sampling doesn't seem very crisp.  The effects sometimes feel muffled or drowned-out, unlike the sharp sounds you get from the arcade speakers. As I say, it's like fiddling with that old Gauntlet II machine on freeplay.  It's fun, but the appeal definitely wears after a while.This is not the fault of those who handled the PS2 conversion of Gauntlet: Dark Legacy, because they've done an exemplary job.  Technically, this port is everything you could ask for, and there's been an admirable attempt at added value for the single-player game.  If they'd had something stronger in the way of raw material to work with, we'd have a great console game.But a great arcade game does not always a great console game make, and Gauntlet is an example of this.  What makes it fun in the arcades just can't quite carry over.", "date": "May 7, 2001"}
