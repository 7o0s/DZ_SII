I'm not so sure that this fact has much to do with the review I'm about to write, but I just thought you should all know. Every few months or so, I load up my car with snacks, CDs and friends and we head up to the Biggest Little City in the World to do a little late-night gambling. A few days before we take off though, we all like to test out our latest strategies on whatever PC casino title happens to be in vogue. Other than that, I'm usually not so interested in pretending to gamble on a PC when I could actually be at the tables. After spending a few days with Hasbro's latest game/videogame merger product, Monopoly Casino, I think I've finally found a title that will stay on my hard drive for more than just the few days before a road trip.  More than anything else, Monopoly Casino is a very, very complete casino game simulator. Included straight out of the box are PC versions of poker, blackjack, Pai Gow poker, roulette, money wheel, keno, video poker, craps, and a load of different slot machines. Each of these games comes with a huge number of different variations in the way you play. All in all, the game boasts over 200 variations of play, which is way more than I was ever interested in to start with. Still, it's cool to know it's there.  The most important part of any decent casino sim is how well it simulates actually standing in front of a table. Monopoly Casino has this down pat. All of the different tables (with the exception of the Monopoly Roulette table) work exactly like they do in a real casino, except the machine doesn't yell at you when you make a mistake. Too bad  maybe they can include that in the next version. In multiplayer games, like blackjack and poker, the AI behaves like you would expect human players to behave in a casino setting. Best of all, the interface used in all the different games is extremely simple and intuitive. You just set a bet amount in the bottom left hand corner, and then every time you click a spot on a table, you'll drop a chip worth that dollar amount. Not only does this make all of the games easy to play, but it also teaches novice players good habits that they can carry to a real casino. The dealer calls are all well done, but the game is lacking any of the extraneous banter you'd normally expect to hear around the craps table.  One of the nicest things about this title is that it features sims of several of the new WMS Gaming Monopoly slot machines that are so popular in casinos across the country (or at least in Baton Rouge, Reno and Las Vegas). These monsters feature 9 separate pay lines and bonus round subgames that are really cool. I was really happy to finally get a chance to scope out the way these machines work without having to spend hundreds of dollars or standing behind a old woman who's smoking pack after pack of cigarettes and punching the 'spin reels' button with the single minded determination of a test monkey looking for banana pellets. Unfortunately, the other slot machines in the game are pretty boring and all play the same sound effects time after time. I turned my volume off after about the fifth spin and never turned it back on.  Monopoly Casino offers two different roulette wheels, a standard 00-36 model and a clever variation that replaces the numbers on the table with properties from the board game. Both tables play exactly the same way, but I found the thematic touch nice. Many of the other games also feature similar tweaks  the slot machines all use icons from the game (the luxury tax ring, the free parking car, etc.) and the money wheel uses Monopoly money instead of US bills. While all this may annoy some purists, I really liked it a lot. Why don't you guys just lighten up a little bit?  My only real beef with Monopoly Casino was that the multiplayer was very hard to setup and use. Most people who are going to be interested in this title aren't going to be pleased with having to fool around with DOS and having to write down IP addresses. Still, the game works with the MSN Gaming Zone, which eliminates all of these problems. In the end, Monopoly Casino is a nice little game that will please just about anyone who likes gambling and has a sense of humor. But I'm still waiting for my free drink.  -- Trent C.
