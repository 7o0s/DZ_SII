I'm talking about brief and unsatisfying gameplay,  clichd conventions that are poorly developed, and, perhaps worst of all, characters that you could care less about as you play the game.  That's what makes defending the recently released Astonishia Story so hard.  While it's an easy-to-play RPG with mild tactical elements, the port of the 1994 Korean title to the PSP literally wallows in every one of these problems, making it somewhat of a mess for even hardcore fans of the genre.The premise behind Astonishia Story centers around Lloyd, a knight tasked with protecting a sacred treasure known as the Staff of Cainan. Unfortunately for Lloyd, he loses the item during transport between towns as his entire squad is destroyed (save himself) by a group of bandits led by a mysterious knight known as Francis.  Vowing revenge and the recovery of the Staff, Lloyd travels the world, looking for clues as to Francis' whereabouts and the reason behind the theft.  As he journeys on, he quickly discovers the theft is related to a larger plot by an evil queen to steal mystical items to eventually control the power of a malevolent god for her own use.  It's up to Lloyd and his new group of warriors to recover the staff and stop the queen before the world is doomed. Lloyd in town. At least, that's the initial premise of the game -- a knight out to recover a relic, track down the man that wronged him and save the world.  However, the game ham-handedly funnels you from one location to another, throwing a number of generic tasks at you like defeating bandit leaders, rescuing kidnapped girls and handing over items.  Sure, these kinds of tasks exist in a lot of RPGs, but not at the expense of the main plot; by contrast, Lloyd focuses more on these objects than he ever does on finding the staff, so when you actually do get a bone or two thrown your way about the story, it's much more of an ~it's about time~ feeling than an expansion of the tale.  What's more, these aren't side quests that you can choose to ignore if you're not interested -- you're forced to go through them to make the game progress.  Simply put, after a while you start to wonder why (or even if) you care that Lloyd regains the staff.For the most part, you'll travel across the world through forests, mountain caves and other areas.  If you happen to be on the ~field~ map, you have the opportunity to see where monsters or other enemies are and can avoid them if you wish.  By contrast, ~dungeon~ maps, which can also include forest glens or other enclosed spaces, result in a standard random encounter that RPG fans have come to expect.  This drops you into a turn-based affair akin to the old Shining Force games, where players tactically advance their squad of archers, fighters and magic users against the enemy.  In any given turn, you'll have the opportunity to attack, use a character specific skill, move around the field, or use an item in your character's field of movement.  Creatively, you'll have the ability to collect a number of items of thrown weaponry, such as boomerangs, spears and even rocks, which anyone can wield with damaging accuracy.  The fight ends when one side has completely eliminated the other, and the character that has inflicted the most damage gains an bonus to their share of experience points. Is that Fabio?!?! Tying attacks to this kind of system makes it incredibly easy for anyone to jump in and start fighting against the opponents thrown at you.  Unfortunately, it also winds up pointing out some of the combat system's flaws as well.  There's no advantage for surrounding a target or attacking from the sides or rear.  There's no reason to isolate or attempt to crush one enemy at a time because you're not necessarily going to go through them faster or get more critical hits.  Another issue is that the number of enemies that you go against almost never changes.  Every now and then you are introduced to a new opponent that you haven't seen, but for the most part you'll carry through with the same monsters and same opponents that you did when you started the game.  Even still, they aren't particularly difficult to defeat: Lloyd is much more powerful than any one of the ~cannon fodder~ teammates that you'll wind up getting (with perhaps the exception of the Wizard Lezail and the Monk Rudoug using certain skills), making the five minute battles seem much more like an inconvienence to the story than a necessary part of the game.      In fact, the lack of attention placed on your teammates isn't too much of a stretch thanks to how transitory they are in the game.  Instead of losing a swordsman or an archer to some monster or a massive battle, they simply leave the group once a task is finished.  Not only does it make you not care about giving them protection or items throughout the development of the story, it somewhat makes you resent their presence in the game, because they're just using Lloyd to further their own goals instead of helping him out with his.  Considering that you can probably blow through the game in less than 20 hours (and that's with a lot of time dedicated to leveling up your characters), this isn't exactly endearing to any player.  In fact, it gives you even less incentive when you realize that there's nothing to encourage you to replay the game. That's not how I remember Thanksgiving... The game takes a page from the old school 2D RPGs, with nicely detailed sprites that feel right at home with the gameplay.  There's even some nice animation during certain sequences, such as magic spells that are cast or specific plot moments -- the dragon destroying a town stands out as an example.  This is matched up with a decent and equally antiquated soundtrack that sometimes sounds like it was pulled from a MIDI synthesizer, and while the sound effects are okay, you're not necessarily going to be blown away by the high quality of the sword slashes or yells.  The only seriously strange issue happens to be the constant slowdown that happens every few seconds or so -- the game can't be taxing the system, yet there are hiccups for just about every feature of play, including attacks that are scant seconds apart and even dialogue.This is how engaging RPGs shouldn't be made -- even though its a port of a pre-existing game, it should've been turned into a director's cut with much more content.  It would've been so much more intriguing if the tactics were handled better, you cared about the characters in the game, or the story took longer to develop relationships and plot points.  Instead, Astonishia Story abandons depth and interesting characters for the barest bones of plot and combat, which will easily leave RPG fans wanting more.", "date": "Jun 7, 2006"}
