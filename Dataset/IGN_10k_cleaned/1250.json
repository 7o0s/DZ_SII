Heck, Steve and I even bought Dreamcasts so we could play the game in our underwear in the privacy of our own homes.  For the most part, the PC has pretty much been devoid of skating games (sure, there's Extreme Boards and Blades--get it away, get it away!), and we've been waiting for our shot to catch some big air in a good skateboarding game of our own.  Unfortunately, it looks like we're going to have to wait a little longer.  If you've ever played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, you know how well it moves.  This is the key to the game.  It's smooth, it's responsive, it's fast, and you really feel like you're zooming around a skate park or city streets on your board.  MTV Sports: Skateboarding lacks all of these essential qualities.  For starters, the control system is just plain awkward and unresponsive.  Many times after catching big air on a ramp, I found myself pressing a direction and button combination to pull off a trick only to see nothing happening on-screen.  After keying in your move, it's a mystery whether your skater will actually perform the trick or not. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I even dragged Vincent and Steve over to give it a go, and the same thing happened to them.    Skateboarding is a high-energy sport, so one thing that you should always expect in a game focusing on skating is a true sense of zipping around at breakneck speeds.  You just don't get that out of MTV Sports: Skateboarding.  Most of the time you feel like you're skating through syrup, even when you're flying through the air from quarter pipe to quarter pipe.  And instead of giving you a speed boost as you drop back into the pipe, a handplant actually slows you down (see the videos for an example).  When you come out of a handplant, the camera flips and has to catch up to you, making you all but stop in a standing position on the ramp while the camera readjusts.  A skateboarding game should flow and keep up the energy at all times, and MTV just doesn't cut it.  Another big problem in MTV Sports: Skateboarding is that you can't key in multiple moves one after the other while you're in the air like you can in Tony Hawk.  Instead you have to wait until one trick is finished and then punch in the next one.  This throws off the rhythm and timing of the game, and makes it boring in comparison.  Visually, MTV Sports Skateboarding isn't anything special.  All of the 35 levels are uninspired and boring, and the character models are chunky and bland.  Like the movement of the game, the animation is mechanical and jerky, even on a fast machine.  The collision animations are obviously missing some key frames as one of the funniest animations in the game is the bail animation in which your character goes from a full standing position to lying flat on the pavement.    So what does MTV Sports: Skateboarding do right?  Well, not a whole lot, actually.  It's a mediocre game that could have been a lot better with just a little tweaking.  The best feature is definitely the soundtrack.  As far as licensed music goes, MTV Sports: Skateboarding has a pretty good soundtrack that includes the likes of Cypress Hill, Pennywise, and Deftones.  Unfortunately, the music is read directly off of the CD, causing occasional slow-down and animation jerks in the game.  Sound effects are sparse but effective, except for that damn repetitive ~boo~ you'll hear every time you bail.  I do like the different game modes, such as the Survival mode where you get more time to skate based on the trick you pull off and the Stunt mode that challenges you to pull off a high-scoring trick combo to progress to the next level, but the shoddy controls just ruin the overall game.  Besides winning the ~Game with the Longest Name~ award, MTV Sports: Skateboarding Featuring Andy MacDonald doesn't have too much else going for it.  It's unresponsive, it's slow, and it just isn't much fun.  If you're looking for a good skating game for your PC, we urge you to wait for Tony Hawk 2, because you're just going to get frustrated with this one.  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
