But while the game partially delivers on the first part of the premise, it spectacularly fails to follow through on the ~game~ portion. The Rage-developed title may offer in-game star bios and Beckham history as well as a ~train with Beckham~ mode -- but it lacks one important thing: gameplay.

There is no way to say this nicely: Beckham Soccer is an awful, awful game. Let's start off with options. You can change the game time from 2 minutes to 20 and toggle off fouls and throw-ins. That's it. Next, game modes: you can play a friendly match, participate in the Competition or Season Mode, or try out the built-in ~Train with Beckham~ tutorial mode. You can control up to 32 teams yourself in the knockout version of the Competition Mode -- unless, of course, your batteries run out as there's no way to save your progress. Before you start a match, you can pick from six possible formations and make substitutions (or switch the positions of your players) -- not that it matters, however. Because once you start the match, you will come to the following realization: no matter which player or team you play, you can win by the following strategy: run in a zigzag pattern around the attackers toward the goal, shoot at the goal at a 45 degree angle once you're close, score. Beckham Soccer's robotically moving CPU players are seemingly devoid of any AI patterns. Simply run up to them and steal the ball (no press of a button necessary, simply touch the player -- or run through him), then run away. The players will then follow you using ~Robotron-AI~, but as long as you zigzag, you're fine. How about the passing game, you ask? Well, if you really want to use it, you can use A to pass the ball to another player.   Oh, wait -- were you waiting for something else? You want to know the other controls in the game? Yes, you can shoot the ball with B (hold down the button to shoot it farther) and slide tackle with A when you don't have the ball. That is all. You can safely use the GBA's shoulder buttons to give your index fingers a workout, just don't expect it to do anything in the game. Given the lack of any sort of control depth (not that the AI warranted it), the included training mode is almost like a bad joke. Moving on to the graphics... Though the box proudly proclaims ~3D isometric~ graphics, Beckham Soccer's visual presentation resembles a Game Boy Color game with the playfield slightly tilted (not isometric). This style of zoomed out view lends itself well to soccer games that rely on passing -- something that you don't really have to do to win here -- but if two teams play against each other that have similar jerseys (such as green and blue), it's rather tough to distinguish between them. The sound perfectly complements the shoddy AI and lackluster graphics. After the kickoff, the whole match is so oddly devoid of sound that you'll reach for the volume dial to make sure that it's turned up. While that may make this game the perfect choice for parents who like it quiet in the car, it also ensures that the excitement level while zigzagging around the field is even lower. The game's one saving grace is that it does have an interesting history write-up on Beckham himself, but it certainly doesn't warrant the price of purchase in any way. David Beckham Soccer is a failure on every level. The AI is laughable, the controls are limited, the graphics are muddy, the sound is non-existent, there is no way to save, and virtually any player above the age of six can win the matches without any practice at all. When I picked up this game for the very first time, I won 14:1 without even knowing the controls. It's almost like the goalie in this game discounted the chance that a player would approach the goal at an angle. Perhaps a link-up game against a human player would have provided some much-needed challenge, but since the game is devoid of a multiplayer mode, the only way to enjoy David Beckham Soccer is to not play it.", "date": "Feb 6, 2003"}
