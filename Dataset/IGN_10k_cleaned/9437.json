That issue seemed to quietly fade away, perhaps when people realized it was a dumb thing to argue about. SpongeBob, and his ~partner~ Patrick team up in a new videogame for the Nintendo DS, but it doesn't do much to solidify their masculinity. Altron's SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis also doesn't do much in the way of fun gameplay, but the sponge's charm does manage to shine through.   SpongeBob and the gang - Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, and Sally - board a magical bus that is powered by song, and ride it to the fabled lost city of Atlantis so they can see the World's Oldest Bubble. For any other franchise that story would be preposterous, but this is SpongeBob. It's no more bizarre than the time he rode on David Hasselfhoff's butt, then turned into a magic guitar playing peanut wizard. In fact, compared to the Hasselhoff thing, the story sounds a little bland. Regardless, Atlantis SquarePantis has that bizarre charm that has made the SpongeBob series so popular. Some of the dialogue is a little off, like in the case of Patrick actually saying halfway intelligent things. We wish there was some voicework from the actors in the game, or some animated cut scenes to make the game actually feel more like the cartoon.   SpongeBob and crew travel through three worlds: Bikini Bottom, the lost continent of Mu, and Atlantis. The main levels are mostly platforming, with a mix of brawling and some light puzzle solving. It's a game geared for younger audiences, so none of it is very complex. The levels are pretty basic, with all the cliche floating platforms and bottomless pits that come with the genre. The developers do manage to switch the worlds up a bit. One level has players work their way up a volcano, while another transports them to a Tron-esque computer world inside Atlantis.    The 3D environments are nothing spectacular, but do a nice job of capturing the look and feel of SpongeBob's underwater world. The characters animate well and have their own signature styles.   Spongebob and Patrick are partners, and proud of it. There are four playable characters, everyone except for Squidward. Players control two characters at a time, switching off between them when the need arises. Each character has his or her own special abilities so players will end up controlling everyone to complete the game.   The weird thing is that the levels start off by letting the player pick who they want to control. But the problem is that levels usually require one or two specific characters. Sometimes halfway through the level it becomes apparent that we needed Patrick all along. So then we have to trek back to the start and switch out. An even bigger problem is that switching characters out resets everything, so we have to fight the same bad guys and remove the same obstacles. This is a game for kids; it should have been made simple and just had the necessary characters start.   There is a multiplayer mode that allows two players to each control a character and work through the story mode together. It's a good idea considering the game nearly always has two characters on screen. However, a lot of the game involves using one character to reach places the other can't, and unlocking a new path for them. This means one player has to sit there and wait for his buddy to go through the level, then he gets to follow after him. Not exactly fun. In the later levels, where a lot of combat occurs, it becomes more fun to have a friend to play with, but most of the game it's almost a hindrance.   We wish we had a second player during the later levels, because during single player the AI teammate is useless. He does no fighting whatsoever, so when we're surrounded by Atlantian royal guards, only one guy is fighting. That's fine if the nonfighting party is a nimwit like Patrick, but we expect Sally to kick some butt. It doesn't help that the fighting mechanics are clunky and the fixed camera makes it kind of hard to see.   Between each level there's usually a minigame to play. Some of them, like the Jellyfish Shooter, are fun touch screen controlled diversions. Others, like the fighting game ripoff, make us wish the developers had made all the fighting in the game like that, instead of the toned down version the real game has. All of them are fun for just about as long as they last, which is how a minigame should be.Atlantis SquarePantis is really two almost decent games in one. The single player has some cool parts, and manages to stay at the right difficulty level for the target audience, but it's still clunky and repetitive. The multiplayer is boring because it's not quite designed to work as a multiplayer game. SpongeBob and friends are represented well, and even without voicework they manage to be funny and cute, like the show. It's definitely not a title for SpongeBob's many older fans since it's too easy, and it's too short to really recommend it to anyone that doesn't wake up humming the theme song.", "date": "Nov 6, 2007"}
