This Disney and NewKidCo developed and published Game Boy Color game is tailored for the 4-and-up crowd, which means that your son/daughter/niece/nephew struggling to play your Pokmon or Zelda DX can now play an adventure game tailored for their evolving intellect. And it's got those colorful characters they know and love. It's a simple game, but one they'll probably like. But to you, the person reading this review  your only involvement with the game should be handing the cash over to the person behind the counter and handing the box to your little 'un. Features15 minigamesPlay as Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, and othersBattery back-upOnly for Game Boy ColorWinnie the Pooh Adventures in the 100 Acre Wood is very similar to Uncle Wiggly in structure  the entire adventure revolves around a simplistic board game. This board game is about 90% of the design, so if your kid can't grasp this concept, the game's pretty much over and thrown into the toy box. Luckily, it's overall pretty simple  the interface is a little on the clumsy and unfriendly side, but I should give young kids credit and say that they can fumble around for a bit and figure it out.The boardgame is really simplistic  roll a dice, walk that amount on the game board. There's always a starting point and an ending point, and in most cases the object is to get to the end point first. Sometimes you're the only one on the board, sometimes you're up against a computer opponent. Sometimes all you have to do is land on the same spot as another player. Other times, you just have to keep going to avoid being caught by a computer opponent. There are many variations on the same board game, enough to keep the kids going for a while.All the adventures utilize the ~board game~ engine. The game starts in Pooh's house, and once you head outside the adventure begins. Oh, it's nothing but the usual, everyday occurrences for our gang in the 100 Acre Wood  Pooh gets stuck in Rabbit's Hole, Piglett gets washed away in a river, Rabbit tries to get Tigger lost in the forest, and everyone forgets Eeyore's birthday. Each mini-adventure has two outcomes, and however the adventure is solved, the story is recorded in books which can be read at anytime in Pooh's house. And since the game has a battery back-up, just put Pooh in bed and you can shut off the game in progress. The overhead map is only used to note places you can visit  when you solve an adventure, other paths open up. The more paths you open up, the more opportunity you have to find all the adventures and minigames in this Game Boy Color game.That's right, I said mini-games. There are a handful of small games that, when found, can be accessed inside Pooh's house at any time. One is a simon-says game where you have to remember a series of directions while Pooh exercises. In another, you collect falling acorns and dump them into a bucket before your bowl overfills. And still another, you fish on the bank of a river to collect as many as you can before time runs out. These games aren't very elaborate, reminiscent of  those found in the Game & Watch titles from Nintendo. There are some small issues I had with the game that might be a bit confusing for kids when they play this game. The most obvious one revolves around the task of solving the board game to open up a fork in the road. Now, most forks have three different paths, each of which will uncover when you land on a specific spot in the board game. To open up the other paths, you have to go into the board game again and find the other two spots you didn't land on. The game doesn't tell you which spots have already been landed on, so it's up to the player to remember which one they landed on before  and with many different forks in the road, even I had a hard time remembering. The game is well designed and cute, and tailored well for the audience it was made for. There's not too much variety in the overall game design, but there's enough here to keep the young 'uns entertained. It is for kids; there's nothing here that would last the veteran gamer for more than an hour. For the under-ten crowd, a good few car trips to Grandma's.", "date": "Apr 20, 2000"}
