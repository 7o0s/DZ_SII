Following in the wake of two previous stabs at the category -- Digital Chocolate's Brain Juice and Upstart Games' IQ Academy -- Gameloft tries its hand at the ~make yerself smarter~ trade with Brain Challenge. The game follows all the necessary bullet points required for a successful brain game such as stat tracking and employs some solid production values, such as the patented ~French anime~ found in many Gameloft titles.   While DChoc's clinical and entertaining Brain Juice was more in line with the Brain Age Nintendo DS game, Brain Challenge is more aligned with the arcade-ish Big Brain Academy. The puzzles are thrown at you with an ever-shrinking time limit and awards you points on not only how many you get right during the test session, but also how many you get correct in a row and how fast you provide the answer. At the end of each test session, you're issued a letter grade, which is a measuring tool most Americans can identify with. The game also records your daily progress, allowing players to track their brain stats and see any improvements. This is a pivotal feature that no game in the genre should be without.   The puzzles are stretched across four different types of thinking: math, memory, spatial, and logic. Each category has three different test for a total of 12 mini-games. Brain Challenge does not hand out all 12 games right away -- you unlock new games by practicing the available tests five times. If you've played some of the Nintendo DS games, you'll be familiar with some of Gameloft's puzzles, such as the a test where you must discern which item on a series of scales is the heaviest. One of my favorite games is available right from the beginning, called Trout Route. You must snake through a grid of numbers, following a pattern dictated by an equation. For example, if you see +8 above the grid, you have to trace a path from 8 to 16 to 24 until you reach the required number of moves. When the numbers hit triple digits, this can prove quite challenging. One of the more challenging logic games is Magic Rule, which asks you to look at a series of patterns and then apply the pattern to a third object. If you see a series of numbers turned on their backs, you have to select the proper orientation for the third number.   Fortunately, you can practice all of the mini-games before heading into the test session which charts your movement through the different schools of thinking. You're graded on a final result and that score is posted to your progress chart.   The game offers a smart, complete package that I wholly enjoyed. Does it mine familiar territory? Sure, but it makes sure to solidly nail all of the genre's conventions and the majority of the mini-games are entertaining. (You'll have your own favorites. While I disliked the Magic Rule game, you may be discouraged by the Arithmetic test.)   The game interface is smart and clean. Gameloft assigns a background color to each school of thinking so when you take the big test, you can see what kind of challenge you're about to go through by looking at the backdrop. That's a great addition. Also cool -- while loading up a puzzle in the practice sessions, a comely professor asks you trivia questions about brain functionality, such as ~What is declarative thinking?~ After you finish the mini-game, it tells you the answer.  Brain Challenge is the best of three brain training games I've played so far, just edging out Brain Juice. (When I literally spend about three hours playing a game on the first afternoon I receive it, I know something's good.) However Gameloft's and Digital Chocolate's games are different enough that they're both reside quite nicely on your handset. The majority of the puzzles are good and the production values are strong -- plus the inclusion of critical stat tracking makes this a complete package. Brain Challenge doesn't force any evolution on the genre, but it employs some smart design choices to make it a worthwhile download for anybody interested in the brain training category that either doesn't have a Nintendo DS or feel like carrying it everywhere.", "date": "Sep 22, 2006"}
