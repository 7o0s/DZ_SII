It's not often that I feel genuinely compelled to inflict seriously life altering bodily harm on fictional characters, especially those found in Star Trek videogames. I feel such a desire now, however. Mr. Head of Starfleet Academy and the people behind his wretched voice, infuriating dialogue and unfathomably irrational design need to be drug out into a field and made to repeatedly watch Kangaroo Jack while being shot in the crotch with a potato gun. Thankfully, few other moments of Elite Force II so effortlessly awaken the murderous, primal ape within us all.   Genetics has bred mankind to be a race of killers. Since the earliest of our ancestors learned how to roll boulders onto Mammoths, we've longed to obliterate living things that were not us. Elite Force II is all about keeping this demon within each and every one of us sinners in-check by indulging it and only it. It's about walking, shooting, whipping out the old tricorder on command, and most importantly, killing things. If you need to seriously think while playing, you're going to seriously need to head back to grammar school and play with the colored blocks.  The first Elite Force, as should be expected given the premise of this sequel, was a strict, down and dirty first-person shooter with little time for pleasantries and a lot of time for the exploding of various extraterrestrials by blasting them in the face with an assortment of particle weapons. Unfortunately for Raven, Activision and ourselves, Elite Force had a few problems: it was a part of the deplorable Voyager fiction; the story was out of control; the game was super, super short; and, it wasn't all that Star Trek. Elite Force II phasers away three and a half of those problems, though it seems the boys and girls at Ritual perhaps spent a bit too much time being faithful to the original game, when more time should have been placed on being new, fresh and faithful to Star Trek. Will this underlying problem burst the plasma vent and flood the game's aft decks with lethal radiation, thus killing us all? Do I have any idea what I'm talking about or am I just pulling warp conduits out of my behind? Does anyone even care? All this and more answered in a few thousand words...promise.  This game is about as straightforward as they come. Very linear level design with a few branches here and there contradict what we heard the game would be like early in its development. Branches can be good, even if they are few and far between. A lot of these are wholly unfulfilling. Since a game of pure action and nothing else rarely succeeds, and in this piece of fiction would be preposterous, Ritual had to add a few things between the carnage to maintain pacing, keep the game Trek, and step on any potential repetition, while at the same time delivering much sought after longevity. Some of these implementations work, others do not. Branches in mission all invariably lead to dead ends. The only justification for exploration is the acquisition of golden starships, sure to be made useless by imminent hacks. These collectables allow players to unlock stuff like new maps and new maps and possibly new maps. Fun, fun, fun, only finding this crap involves stumbling about in the dark, fondling walls like a tool and gazing through the red-orange haze of a structural integrity vision filter when you'd rather just shoot the hell out of something.   This is not to say the game's second ploy to spice up the action, the tricorder, is of no use or joy. It's kind of like a sex toy. When you need to use it, it's great. When you want to use it, it can be great. When you're forced to use it, it's not so much fun. Knowing I can scan things is cool. Knowing that scanning is totally useless unless there's preset gas or a broken wall or some traps around is not cool. Throughout normal play, the tricorder's function is so rigid and defined that any fun that may have come from playing the role of the inquisitive, investigative scientist on a search to complete a mission is sapped dry. And why the hell doesn't the radar in the top right corner actually show up on the damned tricorder itself where there's conveniently a nonfunctional radar in its place?  Sounds like a pretty crappy sex toy, huh? Not entirely, even if implementation is drab and its use is tedious, there are some pleasurable ways to handle the thing. Another key to breaking up the monotony of constant action is the game's few mini-games, some directly related to the tricorder. A few times in each mission it will become necessary to meddle with a computer system of some sort, which involves playing a small game of match the wavelength modulation or connect the pipe looking circuits. Neither is a full game in and of itself, but both compliment the action and help drop players deeper into the role. From their inclusion a question surfaces... Why not have more? More interactive door hacking of different kinds, more computer hacking, more file retrieval? Ritual had a good thing in this regard with Sin and this next-generation of shooter could have and should have been much more, even given as cool as it already is.   So now that you basically know what spruces up the killing, what's the killing like? Neat. The large swamp crickets combust nicely. The story, played out by some rather tedious cutscenes and a predictable assortment of lifeless but intentionally diverse characters, is strong enough and long enough to be engrossing. It gets pretty good and ultimately introduces some interesting concepts, dropping the Enterprise into precarious but never truly outlandish circumstances (we need to stop this giant blob from destroying the universe with its mutated eggs or whatever the hell the first was about). I attribute this engrossment more to the action and atmospheric work and the design itself than to the writing. Sure, scripting is pretty solid, so if you don't help someone or save someone, you'll have an immediately different effect, but not a lasting one that will have any real implications on the gameplay.      But know that Elite Force II is not all sunshine and buttercups and wholesome flaming death. It just doesn't seem to be enough Star Trek to appease fans. Yes, some voices are in there, as is the now typical onslaught of blatant and obscure references to the fiction (specifically premises and mentions of episodes from other series'), but the pacing is anything but Trek. Fans will agree with some of the additions, but disagree with others. Why are so many levels so dark and moody (which wouldn't be so bad if I had a flashlight and not just night vision to rely on)? Why am I on a ~shoot first and never scan~ basis with everything I see? What the hell is this weapon I'm using?  Really, why is it whenever anyone attempts to utilize an existing science fiction setting, specifically Star Trek, they always feel compelled to throw in insect-like aliens or lame ass robots or something that just doesn't belong? The Fallen did it. Elite Force did it. And now Elite Force 2 is doing it.  There is such a great abundance of material to work with within the nearly limitless confines of the fiction that it seems totally unnecessary to incorporate something new in place of all of the old stuff that exists. The Exomorphs do work for the game's action setting, and work well since they move fast, come in acceptable numbers, and explode pretty well, but that doesn't mean you can't focus on bipedals and have the same kinds of excitement. The solid feel and buttery movement of the Quake III engine is there and ready to deliver any kind of shooting experience wanted, but most of the more exhilarating combat doesn't come from blasting bugs, it comes from devastating the races you know and love. It's sad then that so much focus has been placed on something new as opposed to something old.   Why try to add so many weapons that are so stereotypically FPS when it could be paradoxically possible to innovate by not adding anything new (I know, stupid words like that sound more pretentious than smart, but it works). Pay attention. If you're making a Star Trek game, try to first include a bunch of cool Star Trek weapons and then worry about the lame infinity mods and arc guns and photonic proton emitting heat tracing torpedoes. The Romulans, Klingons, Federation, Cardassians, Dominion, and even Ferengi all have at least one kind of handheld weapon and one kind of rifle. In fact, many have several different kinds of each. Alter the feel on each and make some more/less powerful and others faster/slower and you have awesome variation without having the standard set every other game has. Adding so much classic shooter stuff just doesn't make Elite Force II Star Trek. But, that does not mean it is necessarily bad.   Each of the weapons in the game may not be appropriate, but each is functional when the context is understood. Since EFII is such the twitch shooter, all is well. Since it claims to be Star Trek, all is not well. See the predicament -- the same one people no doubt faced when playing the original. Does it matter in the end when bodies are flying and the rush is upon you? Not really, but it'd be nice to see a Star Trek action game that was actually freaking Star Trek, if only just once.    So we have this shooter that's oddly enough, all about extremely straightforward shooting. What's so great about that? Polish as far as the eye can see. The AI is nothing to swoon over, and indeed you won't even know it exists until you venture far past the rushing Exomorphs, but EFII is pretty enough, solid enough, fast enough, and responsive enough to be enjoyable enough, even if it does lack a bit of graphical candy and some basic interface love.  Why I can't shoot while leaning is a riddle not even the mighty and whimsical Q could solve. Better yet, what the hell do some of the advanced graphical settings mean? Does setting the simple lights function to close mean it will make simple lights disappear at close ranges or turn them on at close ranges? A little trip into the readme clears this up, but a bit more forethought into the interface would have helped.   Graphically, for as good as Quake III looks these days, it could look better. No ragdoll physics. And my tears softly fall... Stiff facial animations and a serious lack of anything that should be standard (bump-mapping and pixel shading) make for a crisp, vibrant, well-rounded, but technically limited title. When a game like Mace Griffin can take comparatively low poly environments and spruce it up with excessive bump-mapping and pixel shading, there's no non-technical excuse why it shouldn't have been done here. And if there is a technical reason, so what?   What did you think of Elite Force 2?  But it does sound damn good. The music is completely off at times (it's hard to pick out anything that's a true and faithful conversion of existing Trek tunes), but sound effects are brilliantly crisp and come delivered by state-of-the-art 3D positioning. All this adds immersion. Immersion adds fun. Fun adds dollars to Activision's wallet.  You'll want all this aesthetic and aural love if you're going to enjoy the robust multiplayer component. EFII has a surprisingly solid, configurable, and customizable multiplayer experience with a wide variety of maps and some pretty exhilarating modes. It's not anything that will crush reigning champs, but it does make one wonder how multiplayer only games can be justified given the sheer level of inclusions here. Very nice stuff. Do you like to shoot things? Do you like Star Trek? If you answered ~hell yes~ or ~yes~ to the first and ~sort of~ or ~I guess~ to the second, then you'll really, really like Elite Force II. If, however, your response sounded something more like, ~A true Starfleet captain first relies on experience and diplomacy to resolve potentially hostile situations~ and you are at this very moment crying and staring up at the night sky, don't even bother playing this. Like Nemesis, it will probably piss you (the hardcore fan) off more than it will please you.Elite Force II is an excellent follow-up to the original, but perhaps doesn't hit with enough technical wonder to make it seem truly new or next-gen. That does not mean it's without worth. Front to back, with a few mind numbing gooey portions in the middle that should be spat into a napkin aside, EFII is a solid, fast, but always dumb action romp. So then why is it Trek? Trek is smarter, slower and less crazy. The answer: Who cares?It's all about shooting with a few minor touches to make that shooting enjoyable. The fiction is not a focus of the game, but rather a backdrop to carry out the slaughter of enemies at a frantic pace and in cliched situations. Twitch shooters will dig it, for EFII is quality gaming deserving of a purchase.", "date": "Jun 24, 2003"}
