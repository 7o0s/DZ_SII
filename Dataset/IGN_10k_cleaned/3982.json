We're a maddeningly hard-to-impress lot these days.  And let's point fingers while we're at it, shall we?  It was Half-Life, flat-bang, and all its (wonderful) hideous progeny.  Before that, many of use were quite blissful in our collective ignorance, just so taken with the notion of any attempt at the immersive/first-person experience...and then the creative drama-queens at Valve showed us all what retards we all were.   Bless them for the revelation, and damn them for the aftermath; it makes it that much tougher to judge something like Chaser -- a basically well-meaning and mechanically-sound (but less-than-polished) first person shooter that, in a Valve-less universe, might have seemed great instead of, well, ~troublingly good, considering.~  Again, thanks a load, guys.  Seriously.Not that Chaser doesn't give you a run for your money; dramatically and otherwise; show me someone claiming Chaser was too easy from the outset, and I'll show you a big fat liar.  You awaken as the amnesiac protagonist John Chaser, suffering some rather unpleasant flashbacks on an exam table while faceless armed forces storm your space station in general and your med-lab in particular, apparently bent on killing you for no adequately explored reason.  There's a troubling bit at the beginning where you don't have a weapon at all, and early on stuff is rupturing, sparking and generally blowing up all around you (all augmented by the roving bad guys trying to cap you).  You'll find a weapon soon enough, but by then you'll already have learned to trust nothing; not only are your surroundings themselves unstable (full of exploding panels and collapsing supports), but even careful, properly-paranoid players will find themselves being continually-surprised by numerous, cheaply-spawning (and way-too-alert) enemy sentries.   Fortunately or unfortunately, these guys aren't the daunting, flank-and-flush foes of Half-Life; in fact, they're fairly dumb, which almost makes up for the fact that a number of your weapons seem underpowered (watch what happens -- or, more often, doesn't -- when one of your grenades goes off near a pack of enemies).   Part of this stems from the nicely pragmatic approach of littering a science-fiction flavored world with a decidedly contemporary arsenal -- you'd think a universe of massive space stations and a colonized Mars would have moved on from Sig Sauers, Ingram M-10s and a host of other basically-recognizable slug-throwers...and you'd be wrong.  It's kind of cool, actually.From the debacle on the space-station (which culminates in the  clichd-but-reliable dash for the escape pods through the klaxon-blaring, self-destructing outpost), you'll visit the gangland slums of Earth, become entangled with goons both Mafia and Yak...and yes, you'll even Get Yohr Ass to Maahrs as Chaser's past unfolds in the form of cinematic cuts. The whole thing might feel like a bit of a derivative mishmash, yes -- you won't have to recall any mnemonic devices to star in this trailer, if you follow me.The gameplay itself is challenging and never dull, always just on the verge of inspired.  There's a lot of the scenery going kerflooey -- glass shattering, pipes busting, supports collapsing -- but due to the ultimately single-minded nature of the levels (which are huge, by the way), much of it feels less dynamic than...well, canned.  No interactive experience can please every taste, of course, but when a ~surprise~ event seems bound to happen no matter what course the player takes, it kicks the audience back a layer or two.  That being said, the best bits of Chaser are when you and somebody else are absolutely trashing all the intervening scenery between you.  The Wachowski brothers have dreams like this, when they've had too much candy before bedtime.One dramatic aspect that never completely loses its appeal is the adrenaline mode, which slows apparent time down to an aurally-mushy crawl in the vein of The Matrix's bullet-time effect.  It's less than necessary or new, but it works at least as well as, if not better than, it has in many previous games.Dramatically ambitious? Yes. Terribly smart or sophisticated?  No. Again, we've become collectively spoiled, and we almost automatically expect our games to cater to a certain depth-expectation. Chaser has some great running gun-fights and crossfire moments (owing largely to its nastily-conceived level design), but it still has the definite feel of a budget-tending title, with all the label implies.  AI finesse is here replaced with in-level placement, sheer numbers, and some cheap--but oh, so very effective!--~surprises.~ You'll wish the good-looking environments had a little more interactivity; they don't.  The storyline is a rollicking but stock cyberpunk tapestry, no worse than its influences and in some cases better.  And while the voice-work is computer-game-standard execrable, the dramatic impact of the cinematics themselves is effective stuff--the kind that turns okay games into good ones and--occasionally--good ones into great ones.  Chaser is a good one...which hurts, a little, because more all-around polish might have made it great.  Deathmatch, CTF and objective-centered multiplay modes are a nice addition, but Chaser's best grip on any potential player is the massive, sprawling single-player campaign, flaws and all.   If you're not a complete, raging spoiled brat (like some of us here, hanging our heads in knowing, arrogant shame -- a neat trick, if you can do it -- and can take your dramatic, run-and-gun action minus a few cut corners, Chaser will keep you engaged and more than a bit paranoid for at least two or three full gaming-days on end...and that's before you start exploring your multiplayer options.", "date": "Oct 7, 2003"}
