Well, that may be what publisher Acclaim Entertainment (and first-time football developer High Voltage Software) is hoping anyway. Since 1997 it has annually released updates to the QB Club football gaming franchise, but it's been quite the downhill slide unfortunately. Times have changed, and this year it's almost as if the original game has simply been defrosted for another go on our precious football deprived N64.  The first of the series to hit the N64 was NFL QB Club 98. Back then it made a big splash as one of the first console games to ever run in 640x480 high-resolution mode. But the accomplishment has since faded following the advent of such wonders as NFL2K on Dreamcast and Madden NFL 2001 on PlayStation 2. And unfortunately, NFL QB Club 2001 is again just the weenie little kicker in comparison to these 240-pound gorillas of steel. It's not a completely worthless effort and even improves on last year's game. But is it the best football game on the N64? You better keep reading before you decide to run out and pawn your jock strap for some spending cash.

The good news is that NFL QB Club 2001 is actually an improvement in the gameplay department. The framerate has been bumped up a tiny bit, but honestly, that's not saying a whole lot considering how choppy the title was last year. Unless your parents raised you with a strobe light in your room, you might find NFL QB Club 2001 to be a bit painful on the old peepers. But at least now you can actually follow your player onscreen once the ball is snapped and the action ensues -- a feature not every QBC game can boast.  The menu system this year is nearly identical in functionality to the previous years with just a slight graphical update. All the standard features and options are available, and Acclaim has always gone the extra mile to allow you to tweak as much as possible. You can customize everything from your screen size to the penalty settings if you so desire. Once into a game, you'll find that the play calling menus have received some much needed fixing. Now you can actually use the analog control stick to maneuver through your offensive and defensive sets instead of being forced to go back and forth to the digital pad. Run and pass plays have also been color-coordinated this year, something which should have been done a long time ago. Sadly, the plays themselves appear to be all too familiar to those in the previous renditions, with little variety between the teams as well.  Once you've made it through the menus it's time to lace up your cleats and take control of your favorite team. A few changes have been made to QBC 2001 which lend the gameplay a hand. The first is the newly added ~shoulder charge~ button instead of last year's juke button. It functions exactly as it sounds -- your player will tuck his head and plow full steam ahead. This can be somewhat satisfying, but only on the rare occasion that it is effective and the framerate doesn't drag. Another nice touch is the simplified passing scheme. Now, like most console football games, you simply hike the ball and your receivers will light up automatically on pass plays. Seems like a great feature in comparison to last year, but again, it's a feature that really should have always been there in the first place.  In terms of the running and passing game, QBC 2001 just can't hang -- especially in comparison with those other next-generation gridiron titles. Forget trying to dance your fullback through a hole in the defense. The average running play is reduced to simply charging into the crowd and pumping the A-button as fast as you can. The same goes for passing, as you'll struggle to read the defense before blindly tossing the rock to one of your downfield receivers. Supposedly you can touch-pass the ball depending on how long you hold down the button, but thus far it appears rather ineffective. Frankly, the game seriously disappoints when attempting to put the player in control of the team.  Graphics Believe it or not, this year's QBC is actually less graphically detailed than the year before. And that's a good thing. It's not drastic, but it's just enough to give the framerate a minor bit of smoothing. The animations are still rough, but at least the motion-captured movements are done fairly well and look realistic. The biggest difference is that the player models are noticeably chunkier this year. Looks like we're back to the angular arms and square feet again. Zoomed out they almost appear pretty good, but once the camera pulls into the action you better watch your eyes -- those things are pointy, fellas.   Even the textures seem to have lost a bit of their shine from last year. The field is one big blurry stretched out mess of a texture, and the same thing goes for the crowd in the stands. Don't even get us started on the skyline background textures. The players and referees also show fewer details on their uniforms -- again for the sake of framerate. A word of advice: don't consider playing this game without the use of the RAM Expansion Pak. You think it suffers right now? Just yank that bad boy out and discover what real pain is, friends. Not pretty.  Sound The NFL is known for it's hard-hitting action, but the sound of QBC 2001 would never convince you of that. ~D-Fense.~ Stomp. Stomp. We're afraid it doesn't get much better than that since the sounds of shoulder pads colliding are practically non-existent in the game. Instead we only hear the soft and scrambled thumping of contact on the line mixed with the occasional grunt. The midfield tackles crunch like someone chewing their cornflakes too loud, and the crowd rings in your ears like the ocean through a seashell. You're probably better off spinning your favorite ~Jock Rock~ CD instead of cranking up these sound effects too loud.  Then we have the announcers just waiting to kick-in with their average play-by-play commentary and erratic witty remarks. If we ever hear the phrase, ~He runs for a short gain~ again in our life, it'll be too soon. And what exactly does this mean: ~When he hits like that, you'd swear he'd do it for free.~ That one left us staring blankly at the TV for quite some time. QBC 2001 is not exactly a gem in the commentary department, but honestly very few sports games on the N64 have been able to accomplish such a feat. The question is, how desperate are you for an N64 football game right now? Hopefully not at all because NFL QB Club 2001 will more than likely disappoint. Unless you are a hardcore fan of the Acclaim football series, then I'd suggest putting this title on your rent list instead of into your shopping cart. While it does make significant improvements to last year's game, that alone just doesn't make it a good football game overall. My advice to Acclaim would be to simply drop the QBC franchise altogether and focus on its more promising baseball and first-person shooter games. It looks like EA's Madden NFL 99 is still the reigning N64 champ, but be sure to look back for our full review of Madden NFL 2001 when it finally ships. Chances are, either title will bring you more pigskin for your buck.", "date": "Sep 6, 2000"}
