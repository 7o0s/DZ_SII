Such a massive blast serves as the catalyst for the events of Secret Files: Tunguska, a recently released adventure title from Fusionsphere Systems. You play primarily as Nina Kalenkov, a young woman whose father gets nabbed by an unknown party, sparking her search. She's joined by Max Gruber, one of her father's coworkers. Starting off in their hometown of Berlin, Nina and Max follow a twisting series of leads across the globe, visiting pubs in Ireland, asylums in Cuba, and the Himalayas, among other locales. Though the story and characters aren't the strongest around, the game manages to stay entertaining thanks to a convenient interface and some interesting puzzles.   As a third-person point and click adventure game, Tunguska still manages to shake off the dust that often settles on this genre's gameplay. First, it's got a button that shows all the spots that can be inspected or manipulated onscreen. This isn't really anything new, we've seen other games with glowing items or sparkles or whatever, but it's definitely appreciated. You'll accumulate quite a few items while moving through each area's generally static screens, many of which can be combined. While it's fun to see what items fit together, combining them can occasionally feel more like random chance than an exercise in logic. For instance, who would have thought a wrench should be combined with a hollow street sign? Even though some combinations don't make a lot of sense, they're still easily accomplished by clicking through every item in your inventory.    For the most part, Tunguska's puzzles keep from becoming unnecessarily confusing, though there's an occasional oddball. Weights on the phonograph come to mind as a little of the ordinary, and the method for acquiring a safe combination in Cuba is truly bizarre. By far the most interesting part is the tandem puzzle solving between Max and Nina. Unfortunately, this only happens during one sequence where Nina is trying to escape captivity. There's another instance where players can switch between Max and Nina as they explore two different areas, but they'll never be able to directly aid each other like in the escape.   It's too bad Tunguska's characters weren't better. Nina's most prominent characteristic (aside from her jeans) is that she misses her father. Max's major trait is that he likes Nina. Eventually a few characters are revealed to have additional layers of personality, but they're never very deep or intriguing. There are also a few logistical issues that keep it from being really believable. First, it's never really made clear how Nina or Max are making all these trips across the world, or how Nina is capable of some of the monumental athletic feats she's able to perform. During one of the game's more interesting puzzle sequences, Nina is able to clamber across the top of a speedy train. Is that a move every researcher's daughter can expect to pull off when required? We're going to guess not.    In addition to a few informational gaps that trivialize parts of the game, too many plot revelations are withheld until right near the end. This means that through most of the game you're fed morsels of plot and progress largely on assumptions. Normally this might increase a gamer's hunger to reach the end, since they want to find out more more. The problem is, even though you will want to know what's really going on, you'll have no idea of its scope or severity of the issue at hand until the game's practically over. We know there are a number of furtive interest groups whirling about and are given hints about what could occur, but the world never really seems to be in danger. Even after the game ends, we found ourselves unsatisfied with how much information was divulged, particularly regarding the most interesting faction of the game.     Those gripes aside, there's nothing really wrong with the story, it just could have been much better. The general lack of strong personalities doesn't help. At no point does Nina really seem at the ragged fringe of her sphere of personality, but rather always in the content, sometimes sarcastic but generally optimistic center. If Nina isn't under much stress over her missing father, how are we supposed to empathize? Thankfully the puzzles pick up the slack. Sometimes requiring numerous items to be combined and utilized in various ways around the environments, like using a torture room in a mansion to forge a ring, the puzzles remain interesting and entertaining throughout the game's progression.   Helping to keep track of everything is a journal that updates with important plot points, which you can occasionally consult for puzzle tips. Other than that there isn't much else to the presentation. Each item and environmental point of interest can be examined and sometimes looted or operated. Whichever character you're controlling walks rather slowly around the fairly small map areas, though thankfully you can double click an exit to move quickly through. Visually Tunguska looks pretty good, though some areas like the train look far better than others. Character models animate rather stiffly, though that's offset by some cool environmental animations that all too rarely liven things up.    Plenty of voiced dialogue has been packed into Tunguska, but quite a bit of it isn't worth listening to. Nina's got a good voice as do a handful of supporting cast members, but some characters like Max and the main villain sound awkward and, in the latter's case, laughably cheesy. A few music tracks pop up across the environments, which are nice to hear. There are also some crisp, realistic ambient effects that take over the soundtrack when the music isn't bumping, quite capable of keeping your ears interested.It won't blow you away with its narrative or characters, but Secret Files: Tunguska can still entertain with some interesting puzzles and easy to use interface. There are a few standout sequences in the game such as uncovering the mysteries of a moving train and working with two lead characters to solve the same puzzle, but for the most part Secret Files feels pretty standard. That's not such a bad thing, however, as there are still lots of items to combine across some varied environments. It won't be long before you're absorbed into the game world, trying your best to properly utilize that plush teddy bear you just picked up. It's one of those games where you get the feeling that if few things were done differently, this one could have been really great. As it stands, Secret Files: Tunguska is a solid adventure game that does many things right and leaves plenty of room for improvement.", "date": "Dec 5, 2006"}
