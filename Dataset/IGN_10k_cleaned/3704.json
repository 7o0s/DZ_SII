But rather than offering new gameplay for all of the career tracks currently offered in the base game and the added expansions, Maxis has instead crafted three new fame-centered career tracks that require some significant adjustments to the basic strategies of running a home and meeting your Sims desires.   As such, The Sims: Superstar is easily the best expansion in terms of new gameplay. Where previous expansions focused on adding new objects, jobs or art, they fell somewhat short by only offering new forms of gameplay that were peripheral to the main point of the original game. Taking a vacation or going on a date or getting a pet were fun, to be sure, but none of those additions are as well integrated in to the overall experience of running a household to the extent that the new features in Superstar are.   Before we move on to judge the additions themselves, we should mention that Superstar, like all the other expansions before it, provides an experience that is seamlessly integrated in to the basic gameplay of The Sims. From the art to the music to the overall conception of the project, there's a strong sense of continuity with the rest of the series. There's a lot of humor and personality in the game and the sense of connection is strong enough that even the most ardent fans of the series will be hard pressed to tell where the other expansions end and Superstar begins.   But the main point of Superstar is clearly and almost immediately apparent. You'll be trying to advance your Sims through any of three new career tracks -- acting, music and fashion. And while the inclusion of the regular requirements for job advancement are still in place here, making your way to the top of the fame ladder is going to be much more difficult than reaching a similar level in any of the other professions.   Yeah, you'll still need to work on your charisma and creativity skills and it wouldn't hurt to get your body in to shape, but the fame careers also oblige you to build new and different friendships and require a fair amount of intuition and patience on the part of the player. There's where the challenge comes in.    Although the choices you make in the home certainly affect your potential to become a star, most of the real work will be done in Studio Town. This is an entirely new lot type available in Superstar. Analogous to the Downtown areas of Hot Date, the Studio Lots in Superstar give your famous Sims the chance to ply their trade at a variety of levels. Initially you'll just be able to visit the open mikes and karaoke stations around the lots. If you please the crowds, you'll get noticed and you'll soon be on the long, difficult road to stardom.   But to begin with, you'll be just another fan. In order to become a star you'll first have to get an agent. This is the proverbial foot in the door. Your agent grants you access to the most basic level of star stations. In other words, you can now act in commercials or sing jingles, but you still have a long way to go to reach the highest levels of your profession. (Every day a tabloid is delivered to your house along with the newspaper and mail. It lets you keep up to date on the top tier celebrities.)   A handy system of filters lets you see which studio lots offer the opportunities you seek. If you want to get involved in the world of fashion, simply click the fashion tab and see all the areas where you can participate. Even better, each lot has a unique style and serves a particular range within each career. Some are better suited to starting out while others operate closer to the high end of the career track. The brief descriptions that appear when you mouse over each lot should give you a pretty good indication of what to expect in terms of opportunities. Naturally, you can redesign any of the lots to accommodate your own needs. If you find for instance that there aren't enough modeling opportunities (which there aren't), you can easily design your own lots to add more fashion stations.   Success in the Studio Lot isn't just about building skills. It involves a bit of luck as well. When you perform for your director, choreographer, photographer, etc. you'll need to meet their expectations in terms of style as well as ability. For every role you take you'll have to make three choices from three overall moods. Each mood is played out before you with as much personality and life as the series has seen in a while. If your choices match the expectations of your boss, they'll be happy. If your choices don't match their expectations, they'll be upset. Watching their reaction to your performance gives you a chance to adjust your acting/singing/etc. for a second try.   If you do well enough, you gain fame and money. And though fame is central to your success, the chance to make a little money while in Studio Town is welcome. In fact, Studio Town offers just about everything a Sim could want, except for the chance to recover your energy. Consequently you'll still need to head back to your house to rest and recover before attempting another session in Studio Town. And the Sims are incredibly picky in their attitudes towards work, particularly if they've bottomed out in a particular area. And that's what makes Superstar so challenging -- the need to juggle all these new responsibilities while still maintaining the rest of your life.    To make your way up in the cutthroat world of entertainment, you'll need famous friends. Each new level of stardom requires that you have the requisite number of famous friends. Since fame is variable and considered cumulatively, having a few minor stars as friends is the same as having one superstar as a friend. In other words, knowing the whole Brat Pack is about as good as knowing Elizabeth Taylor. And since the star power of friends is only counted for individual Sims rather than whole families, you'll have to work even harder to maintain relationships. (No more making extra families to boost your friend numbers.) There are also two forms of relationships now, long term and daily so you'll have to make sure you maintain frequent contact with your most famous friends.   Being a star also carries other obligations. You'll need to maintain a regular presence in Studio Town to keep your star rating up. You'll also need to be nice to your fans or risk gaining an obsessed fan (stalker to you and me) who comes around and steals items from your house and goes through your garbage. Hiring a butler takes care of the symptoms of this problem (he'll smack your stalker and send him packing) but you'll need to spend more time with your adoring public if you want to avoid them altogether.   If you're not a star, there's still plenty to do in Studio Town but these new additions are more in keeping with the approach of previous expansions. In other words, the new Studio Town lots only offer non-famous Sims the same type of fulfillment found in other lots. Eat sushi, visit the spa and finish off with a nice smoothie and you'll be on your way to tasting all that Studio Town has in store for the hoi poloi. Both famous and non-famous Sims can still benefit from a range of new Studio Town objects, many of which can be purchased for your homes. Spa equipment and skydiving chambers can go a long way towards increasing your Sims' satisfaction with life in general.   While The Sims' graphics have stood the test of time better than those of most games, there's no escaping the fact that the technology running the visuals is now a bit dated. It still looks good and manages to convey a surprising range of emotion with fantastic animations and inventive designs. The studio lots look fantastic. I especially like the realism of the bare walls on some of the movie sets. The animations for the acting sequences are great as well. Seeing your characters dramatize every little situations is quite hysterical.    The sounds are even better. The new tracks that tie in to the music career are as good as they are varied -- which is to say a lot. The sing-song Simlish is almost funny and good enough to be appreciated outside of the game (although I think I'll wait to buy the soundtrack). There are even varying levels of quality to each so you can tell how good your Sim is getting at their job.   Still, even with all the things Superstar adds, it fails to relieve some of my basic frustrations with the series. Scrolling the screen is still a somewhat jerky and sluggish process. Load times are still long as well. Small pathfinding problems still arise, particularly in some of the more narrow areas of Studio Town but a bit of patience or a quick blueprint change can solve most of these issues. Most frustrating is the tendency of certain actions to drop out of your Sims' queue. While this need to resubmit actions is merely inconvenient when you're dealing with small families, having to reassign deleted actions in a large household can be quite irritating.   But since these are the same issues that have plagued the game since it was first released years ago, fans of the series are obviously willing to put up with them. Ultimately they're merely inconveniences rather than game-killers. The more sophisticated gameplay in the Superstar expansion go a long way towards making up for whatever small technical deficiencies are present in the base game.Another month, another Sims expansion. That seems to be the logic behind the series but given the sales numbers, it's hard to find fault with Maxis' reasoning. Fortunately Superstar manages to move the entire concept of The Sims forward rather than just tacking on more window-dressing. It's not that I'm against window-dressing per se, but most Sims expansions are more concerned with adding things to the fringes of the game rather than integrating them in to the entire experience.Superstar is at once both the most rewarding and most challenging of the expansion packs to date, at least in terms of gameplay. It's a confident step in a new direction and one that I hope indicates what we can expect from The Sims 2. Still, even when measured by the old standard of merely adding new toys and diversions, Superstar scores high. The previous expansions have sold like crazy almost entirely on the basis of new features that, while compelling, still merely served as a sideline to the gameplay that was offered in the original game. In the end, this expansion will be as desirable and enjoyable as any offered so far. Even so, each new expansion only makes us long for the true sequel even more. Until that comes along, Superstar is a great way to fill the days.", "date": "Jun 6, 2003"}
