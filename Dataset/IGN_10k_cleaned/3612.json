The folks at CDV (who have confusingly also published the Sudden Strike series) as well as the developers over at Nival have taken pains to differentiate this new title from the ones developed by Fireglow. Given the numerous and considerable superficial similarities between the two titles, the distinction is sometimes hard to see. But once you delve beneath the surface of both games, you'll find that Blitzkrieg deviates somewhat from the model set by its predecessor.  For those who haven't followed our preview coverage of the game, Blitzkrieg is a real-time strategy game set in the Second World War. Three campaigns allow you to fight as the Anglo-American, German or Soviet armies. (Strangely, though the game was developed in Russia, the use of the word ~Allies~ is here reserved strictly for the Yanks and Brits.) A range of single missions and a full-featured editor open up the possibilities even more.  Like Sudden Strike this new game features lots and lots of units. And when I say lots, I mean hundreds and hundreds. While there are a few missions that prompt you to make the best of a small group of units (on a slightly larger scale than Commandos and with fewer puzzle elements), most of the time, you'll be in charge of entire battalions of infantry and armor with all the accompanying support units.  And as this is more a wargame than a traditional Westwood/Blizzard-style RTS, you won't be worrying about gathering resources to buy or build new units. What you get is all you get and there's nary a harvester or barracks to be seen. There are plenty of opportunities for reinforcements but these are triggered once you achieve certain victory objectives rather than purchased outright when you need them.  Shepherding your forces through the various engagements is a high priority then and really helps to set the game apart from the more economy-driven RTS titles that we're familiar with. While there's strategy-a-plenty to find in those titles, Blitzkrieg pares the economy away leaving the player free to concentrate on the battles. There is a supply system in the game, which requires you to move a fleet of trucks around to keep your units repaired and stocked with ammo, but the game automates this to an extent.  Tactically, the game has a lot to offer. Most of the action takes place below the surface of the game but, as I said in the preview, can be intuited by anyone reasonably familiar with the hardware and doctrines of the era. Tanks are weaker in the rear than in the front. Scouts are able to see farther than other units. Artillery can fire on targets beyond their visual range. This type of modeling puts a greater emphasis on combining the strengths of several different types of units as well as focusing your attention on maneuver.   With about 200 vehicles and roughly 40 types of infantry, Blitzkrieg offers a much wider range of toys than other games. All the conventions of the genre are here -- from hotkey grouping to double-clicking to select units of a type. Like the upcoming Rise of Nations, Blitzkrieg lets you control infantry in groups rather than as individuals.  You'll be rewarded for taking care of your units and getting the most done with the least amount of resources -- not just in terms of proving that you're smarter than a $3000 computer, but also in terms of preserving and improving unit performance. While units aren't strictly carried over from one mission to the next, success in one mission can grant some of your units bonuses in the next mission.  Selecting which units to upgrade allows you to strengthen your armies in specific areas. If you're great with tanks, you may consider bumping them up a bit to gain even greater superiority over your enemies. Conversely you may want to bolster the weaker parts of your army, trusting in your own tactical abilities to maintain your current strengths. This sense of advancement is the justification for the campaigns' optional side missions as well. You needn't blast through the campaign if you don't want to. In fact, taking on a few extra missions between the core missions will put you in a position of advantage over your opponents.  A profile page also keeps you up to date on your own performance in the game. As you finish each mission, the game adjusts a series of ratings that should indicate what kind of commander you are. Keeping units in supply adds to your logistics rating, for instance, while holding back and playing defensively increases your caution ranking. Things like ~sense of duty~ and ~art of war~ seem a bit harder to quantify, but seeing the various ratings rise and fall in response to your decisions helps to tie the separate missions of the game together a bit more than in other games.  Compared to that other CDV game, Blitzkrieg offers an increased emphasis on historical accuracy throughout all the facets of the game. Even better, it makes more of a point of communicating that information within the game. The full catalog of units comes complete with exhaustive historical annotations as well as hard and fast performance data. While it's not a tool that you'll use to squeeze out every tactical advantage, taken as a whole it offers a great overview of the general trends of certain units.      But there are a few issues that hamper this sense of total realism. Some, like shorter weapon ranges and engagement distances are clever concessions to fun. Others seem more like oversights. The fact that wheeled vehicles seem to pass over slit trenches without slowing down seems wrong to me. Likewise, I've been informed that anti-tank guns won't fire on approaching armor because the enemy is outside of submachine gun range. Thankfully these incidents are few and the pace of the game carries you right past them without much fuss.  The mission objectives are spelled out in great detail and you can go back and review them at any time during the battle. Each listed objective expands in to a much fuller description that also offers a hint or two. Handy purple arrows show you each objective on your mini-map, so you won't have to worry about which of the two eastern bridges the game is asking you to take. I found a few instances where old, completed objectives would start appearing as new objectives. After the first few instances this was more irritating than confusing. Cycling through them a few times usually solved the problem.  Blitzkrieg is one of the prettier two-dimensional real-time strategy games to come along in a while. But it doesn't wow with flashy colors or outrageous designs. Instead it makes its point with realistic terrains and units. Trees and villages and roads look quite realistic and are laid out in a much more natural way than in most games.  But while the game comes in 2D clothing, there are a number of 3D elements within. The vehicles are all full 3D models which smoothes out the animations and rotations considerably. The terrain incorporates 3D height modeling but this bears more fruit in the field of tactics than visuals. Occasionally you'll get flat textures overlaying objects in ways that seem inconsistent with the game's emphasis on realism. Seeing craters straddle the ground and nearby bunkers without any break tends to kill the illusion.  Still, the explosions and tracers help communicate the intensity of the action, while the fully realized environments give you a strong sense of place. And this is only heightened by the scars that begin to appear on the environment. Craters are just the first part. Smoking hulks of vehicles and the bloody bodies of infantry lay where they fell (although the vehicles eventually fade away). Buildings come in various states of destruction and seeing your artillery blast a town to ruins in a real joy...particularly if you're a sick bastard like me.   What did you think of Blitzkrieg?  The only performance problems that we had cropped up in the larger missions once there was sufficient damage to start affecting the frame rate. The game automatically drops the overall speed of play down to compensate for this effect. Once some of the larger battles have been underway for a while, the game starts to move in slow motion. Still, you can set the point at which the game starts to slow things down and even adjust the game speed independently of these factors.The World War Two real-time strategy market is about to get a lot more crowded. Last year the field was limited to Sudden Strike and the now abandoned Close Combat series. Now that more publishers are exploring the setting in a real-time format, new titles will have to stand out in other ways. I think Blitzkrieg does this well enough with its greater emphasis on historical accuracy, a relatively convenient interface and a refreshingly transparent and intuitive game system.It still lacks the tactical focus and strange mix of contemplative planning and haphazard action that makes the Combat Mission series so compelling, but as a real-time game (as opposed to the hybrid real-time/turn-based nature of Combat Mission), it has a more direct sense of momentum and action. Ultimately, Blitzkrieg combines the features of a wargame with those of an RTS. This combination doesn't deliver the same experiences you'd get from Combat Mission or C&C Generals and may be harder to approach as a result. Nevertheless, it's a good attempt to bring us the best of both worlds, albeit with some sacrifices.", "date": "Apr 22, 2003"}
