Among them we've seen shooters and platformers, RPGs and adventures  all representing a fair variety of unique designs and gameplay concepts. And though some of these first 150 have been a bit thematically similar to one another, no two of the games have been exactly alike. Until now.   Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine are the same game. With different names. And different presentations, and music, and from different past console platforms  but, cutting through the surface layers to find out what's below, the two titles are essentially the very same experience. Both are U.S.-localized versions of a Japanese title called Puyo Puyo, a ~falling block~ competitive puzzle game that's based on lining up four like-colored blobs to eliminate them from play.    Only they're called beans to Robotnik, and Kirby calls them ghosts. The colorful creatures, whatever they are, fall onto the screen in pairs of two, where you can rotate them into either horizontal or vertical alignment before they settle on the stack below. The trick is to set up chains and combos of multiple matches  put a couple of blues on the bottom, layer some yellows on top, throw in some reds and greens and set it all off in a way that, one by one, the colors fall into place and clear each other out in a single massive move. Completing linked attacks like that will send garbage boulders across the screen to an ever-present opponent's space, and you win when he, she, or an AI-controlled it gets stacked up all the way to the top.     And that's how you play both Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, the striking similarities of which were created as a result of two companies having the same idea, at the same time, in the same era. It was during the 16-bit console war, when SEGA acquired the rights to produce a version of Puyo Puyo for the Genesis system and slapped the Sonic the Hedgehog license on it, while Nintendo also acquired the rights to produce a version of Puyo Puyo for the SNES and stuck the Kirby branding on the box instead.   So it's an odd historical happenstance that the very same game appeared in two different packages on two different platforms, and it's again reflected here now that both versions are available for Wii Shop download. The question for puzzle fans wanting to own either one or the other becomes, then, what differences actually are there? What would justify choosing one version over the other?   And the answer to that is, honestly, not much. As both Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine are priced at the same 800 Point level and offer similar single player and multiplayer features, you can't go wrong choosing one over the other. But there are a few minor points to address.   The first is in control  Robotnik's game supports just the Wiimote, while Kirby's game does not. You're forced to use a Classic or Cube Controller for the Avalanche edition, even though the game doesn't need nearly that many buttons.   The second is in presentation  though it's really a matter of specific fan taste for either license, Kirby's Avalanche does a better job at being a Kirby game than Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine does at being a Sonic game. Sonic the Hedgehog isn't even in MBM. You're left with just the mad doctor and an array of his mechanical minions from the early '90s Sonic cartoon show.   And the last is ... well, there's not really anything else. Beyond the surface level and method of interface, you're getting Puyo Puyo for either one or two players in both packages. And Puyo Puyo is a solid, memorable puzzle game design  so fans of the genre will want to invest in either one or the other.Kirby's Avalanche has arrived in the Wii Shop as we near the milestone of 150 different Virtual Console titles  and its debut comes with fairly little fanfare, as its other console clone, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, has been around since the first 15. It's really a matter of personal license preference between the two  whether you're more of a Kirby fan, or more of a Sonic one  because the gameplay of both titles is spot-on the same. We'd probably give Kirby the slight edge, overall, for puzzle fans who haven't yet downloaded either, but those who don't have access to two Classic Controllers for multiplayer play would be better served to choose Robotnik for its compatibility with solo Wiimotes.", "date": "Sep 27, 2007"}
