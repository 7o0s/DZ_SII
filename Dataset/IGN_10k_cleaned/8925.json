If you're the kind of gamer that has picked up on every scrap of information, read each preview and sourced facts from countless interviews and hands-on impressions, then you're going to buy the game out of sheer curiosity anyhow - the score is just a justification of your purchase. Those looking for a by-the-book, facts-only review of the hows and whos and whats should look elsewhere. Why spoil what makes the game fun? The game is about discovery. This review is all about the experience.    However, perhaps, in the case of BioShock (and other hugely-anticipated titles due soon) the review can serve another more important purpose - it can stifle the hype and cut through the overzealous first rounds of reviews. Hype, after all, is a game killer for a lot of players.    We absolutely adore BioShock. There is so much that is perfect and clever and right about playing it that it makes otherwise almost-imperceptible flaws stand out that much more. After playing through it, we think that it's easily the most interesting and inventive shooter since Half-life 2, and arguably one of the best games of the last 5 years, full-stop.    This is Rapture. An undersea dystopia, waiting to be explored.  The game is a shooter. You'll shoot a lot of stuff; you'll also electrocute, freeze, burn, lift and suspend, trick, manipulate, trap and befuddle the aggressive and deformed inhabitants of Rapture, the undersea dystopia created by billionaire genius and entrepreneur, Andrew Ryan. In that sense, like System Shock 2 or a game like Half-life, no amount of exploration or experimentation ever really draws too far outside the lines that the genre of the game isn't instantly apparent.    For all the inventiveness of the gameplay (which we'll delve into momentarily), those expecting a revelation or revolution in gaming concepts will surely be disappointed. This isn't the second coming - and you can thank too much hype for that kind of implanted notion.   One area that does, in fact, set new high watermarks (no pun) for gaming, is in BioShock's outstandingly realised setting. We've seen some amazing art direction, set pieces and detail before, but this is about the finest combination of artistry, true art deco aesthetic and horror fantasy values combined that we've ever seen.    The city is claustrophobic and beautiful, but dirty and frightening. Each level, which is effectively a themed area of the city, is similar enough to hold the art deco motif together without letting it constrain the sci-fi technology to be found, or limit the variety of the landscapes themselves.  Then, of course, there's the decrepit, rusty ambiance of a flooded, broken-down underwater city that screams Arthur C. Clark and Jules Verne. It's a rich vein of awesome. Water floats corpses down streams; it pools, trickles, oozes, drips and intrudes into every space in the game. You'll feel cold and wet after extended periods of play.   Big Daddies. You will fear them; they're not impossible to defeat, but you won't come out unharmed.   Some areas, such as the Arcadia hills, are defiantly lush and fertile. A simulated forest, complete with mossy hills, trees, trickling rivulets and gorgeous blooming roses, the Arcadia hills and farm area stands out as one of the most stiking areas in the game. It's a departure from the stark corporate offices, hotel rooms and medical facilities of earlier levels.    There's an ongoing debate in the community over whether or not linearity is a good thing in a game. This reviewer is a firm believer in flexible linearity - giving the players a chance to experiment and explore without having to break away from the central plotline. BioShock caters to this kind of preference. The story is a strictly linear affair; you can very easily follow the gold arrow indicator from one objective to the next and tromp through the whole game in a dozen hours. But you'd miss out on two thirds of the content - half of the pleasure of playing Bioshock is found in careful and thorough exploration. Irrational has crafted numerous subtle mini-stories into the rooms, crevices and dark corners of Rapture. Picking up the tape recordings of some of the inhabitants starts tales that are only resolved by listening to their conversations and exploring the world.    Some of the tales are as heartbreaking as they are amusing, too. Finding the mummified remains of a middle-aged couple in a barren hotel room - having overdosed on pills after their daughter's disappearance. Elsewhere a man drank himself to death under a bridge. Searching his body uncovers a stash of booze and packets of cigarettes.   The world is as compelling and lifelike as you want it to be. You can search most desks, crates, drawers, weapons, foes and environment. Or you can ignore the exploration and miss out on all the nifty plasmids that you don't necessarily need to complete the game, but are absolutely desirable and very, very cool.    Sandbox weaponry is the new lens flare. Half-life 2 kicked it off with the Gravity Gun, and BioShock is the next evolution. Injecting yourself with genetic-code-tweaking Plasmids or Tonics endow you with incredible powers - physical, mental, offensive, defensive. In practice, some are really intrinsic to the puzzles in the game; groups of enemies can be stunned or killed by igniting underfoot oil slicks or freezing them and blowing them apart with a blast of shotgun pellets. Elsewhere, some doors can only be activated with a surge of electricity, cameras and turrets of all manner can be momentarily disabled and then hacked with ice or electricity attacks.   Things get more complex when you start getting more obscure Tonics, such as being able to 'tag' enemies, so that hacked cameras automatically summon flying drone bots to take them down on sight. Or, you can trick Big Daddies into neglecting their duty and protecting you for a short time, which sends the Little Sisters scampering into their pipes and out of harm's way. The trick is to combine them - cast Enrage on a Splicer or Big Daddy and watch as it takes out everyone else in the room, providing a great distraction or simply twisted amusement.   The AI is roundly superb. Watching a group of Splicers interacting with corpses - hacking at them with shovels, or babbling to each other in fractured conversation - is just the start. In one of the more striking examples, we watched as a Splicer actually spotted some ammo up on a rafter (god knows how stuff like hypodermic needles, boxes of ammunition or packets of crisps end up way out of reach like that.) and started jumping for it, frantically waving her arms. We mercifully froze and shattered her with a swing from our wrench.   You might want to get that looked at by a medical professional.  Provided you're patient, being creative with your dispensations is worthwhile. Not only will you conserve precious ammunition, but more importantly, you're taking advantage of some priceless situations that the developer has concocted.    Of course, one of the downsides to flexibility is that many players might have an issue with overcomplicating something that can be dealt with using a handful of bullets instead. Why hack a machine and let it work for you when you can run and gun your way through most of the game on moderate difficulty? Rarely are you without ammo, thanks to munitions vending machines. U-Invent lets you create new kinds of ammunition, too - which just ups the temptation to go gun-crazy that little bit more.    That's the real tragedy of this kind of game design. More effort isn't always more rewarding for all players. Manipulating situations can be fun, but that novelty could potentially wear thin after a while, when players realise that it's sometimes more than effective just to blast your way through a situation than go invisible or send out a swarm of bees. It's brilliant, wonderful stuff - but we have a sinking feeling many mainstream players will never dabble in the depth the Plasmids and Tonics offer.   Then again, the weapons themselves offer a lot of invention. Each has three alternate munitions; some are armour-piercing or emit an electric charge; others are explosive or are specifically designed to take down fleshy targets. Upgrading and fashioning new weapons is a little limited - you find a Power to the People station and simply choose an upgrade; sourcing items like screws, tubes and glue is reserved for manufacturing auto-hacks and munitions alone.   Draining ADAM from Little Sisters can either free or kill them. However, the game reduces the impact of this moral choice.  Morality in games - it's one of those often-tried, rarely successfully implemented elements of game design. BioShock comes closer than many, but it's not the quantum leap that it wants desperately to be. In reality, the Big Daddy / Little Sister relationship is not nearly as complex as we were hoping. Sure, the Big Daddy will protect the little sister at all costs, and the Little Sister is potentially vulnerable without a Big Daddy to protect her. But this is all smoke and mirrors, since the gameplay doesn't match the moralistic judgement call. Basically, you can't shoot the Little Sister (of course, because that would have censors and watchdogs in an uproar of Hot Coffee proportions) - and that in itself basically means you can't kill them purely out of being a vindictive creep.    That, right there, breaks the illusion. They're invulnerable to damage, while the Big Daddy is not. Which makes the Big Daddy's involvement kind of a meaningless sacrifice. More than that, watching a Little Sister cry after taking down a Big Daddy is somewhat disturbing, but any emotional impact is undercut when you decide whether to harvest (kill) or save them. There is no physical action involved. It's just a button press one way or the other. That's a bad design decision that really removes complex conscious action from something that is supposed to be a profound moral dilemma. Physically extracting the Adam with a syringe or something similar, where the player must actually judge how much is being removed would've been more interesting and added to the gameplay.    But, of course, the gameplay is still utterly compelling and mostly very inventive. Even when the game occasionally falls into Doom 3-like traditions of respawning enemies and corridor shooting, there are a dozen sequences and scenarios that compel you to put the guns away and use the environment. Every time the controller vibrates with the footfalls of a Big Daddy, you will get a cold chill. You're free to get drunk, listen to tapes, play with faucets and toilets, ignoring the direction-indicator as you go. System Shock 2 laid the groundwork for this kind of gameplay years ago. Half-life 2 refined it. BioShock combined all the best elements of these games, added some fabulous narrative threads, a stirring score, pacing that shames most Hollywood horror films and an patently wondrous  40s-era art deco motif to give it a unique hook.   Again, our criticisms are mostly moot; there's so much to love that we feel bad that the game isn't perfect. Ragdoll-enabled bodies continue to wriggle and twitch after they've fallen. The number of health, ammo and security deactivation stations means you never feel like you're in a desperate or near-hopeless situation. The ability to save anywhere, while mostly a blessing, makes the respawns stations, known as Vita Chambers, a little pointless. The Pipe Dream-like hacking minigame, while good fun, is actually a little easy after a few Tonic upgrades slow the flow of the liquid and decrease the number of short-circuits you encounter.   No amount of criticism could convince us that BioShock is anything less than one of the best games of recent years.  But that's where the list peters out. You'll marvel at everything else - the way the levels open out at just the right moments; the poignant deaths and some astounding effects that we've never really seen in a game before, such as fingers writing on a steamed-up glass pane. The surround sound is used to maximum effect, too. The moan of the Big Daddy is chilling, and incidental noises are enough to make you jump. Thus, it's the sheer number of little details that show you how much care has gone into crafting the massive city of Rapture. The hype promised so much - and it really did deliver virtually all of it to some degree. This is a great game, indeed.   The worst part of Bioshock? It ends. You'll want more to see and do, just as you likely have in some of the best games of all time. And, like the game's maniacal entrepreneur himself loftily aimed, Irrational put art and intellect above and beyond schlock of the common game. They accomplished something wonderful.", "date": "Aug 20, 2007"}
