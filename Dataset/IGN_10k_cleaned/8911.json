It had good pick-up-and-play gameplay and it was free. Anyone who bought the premium 360 got to try the game; if it wasn't suited to a particular gamer's taste, no big deal, since no money was spent on the game itself. Hexic 2 not only dropped the ball in both of these crucial areas, it stabbed the ball, curb stomped the air out of it, and flushed it down a toilet. First and foremost, the price: 800 valuable Microsoft Points, which translates to $10. Ten bucks for a sequel to a free game? That's outrageous. Five dollars would have been understandable, if still slightly overpriced; but $10 simply crosses a line. Again, the first game was free. That kind of sets a precedent for any follow-up.   But, for argument's sake, let's say someone does decide to fork over a couple Lincolns for Hexic 2. It should be just as easy to pick up and play, right? It's a puzzle game, and therefore should be nice and shiny on the surface, yet slightly more complex and layered underneath. Oh, there are layers, but the learning curve required to grasp them is more burden than any puzzle gamer should have to carry. Simply put, there's just too much going on. Four different attack meters, a separate meter (with sub-meters of its own) that has to be filled in order to defeat the opposing player, two different types of bombs, a jewel that swaps pieces, and an 11-page instruction manual that serves as required reading. Eleven pages. Eleven.   Allow me to break everything down. The four attack meters, each of which has its own color--red, yellow, green, blue, all of which correspond to the colors of the game's gems--are filled by way of combining three of one color, thereby eliminating a ~cluster.~ Same thing as the original Hexic, so no big deal. Every time a cluster of a specific color is eliminated, that color's meter fills ever so slightly. When the meter's line is finally full, players can press the Y button to execute an attack, or wait a bit longer to fill another line, which levels up the attack.   Too much, WAY too much. But simply pressing the button doesn't execute the attack. No, players must wait for a group of icons, each representing a specific color and attack, to cycle at the top of the screen. If a player has stored up a red attack, which drops a time bomb in the other player's field, the player has to wait for the red icon to be displayed, at which point a ~Y~ will be displayed over the red meter. Players have no way of manually flipping through the attacks themselves; waiting for the attack to come up is the only option. Perhaps the icon order is green, green, blue, yellow, yellow, yellow, and then red. Unless a player is fortunate enough to have more than one attack meter ready for action, he will be forced to sit through the cycle until the red icon takes center stage. Waiting, eh? That must be the unknown ingredient lacking in all frantic puzzle games--until now.   Frantically flipping gems, filling attack meters, watching the icons scroll through a random order, filling the victory meter's sub meters, micromanaging the new jewel flipper, which allows two jewels to switch places, and working to turn back an opponent's variety of attacks is now available online in Hexic 2. Using one large playing field divided by a line down the center, players work to fill up their victory meter before their opponent. Too much busy work for me, but why micromanage all alone? Invite a friend.   Graphically, Hexic 2 just doesn't look that great. All of the gems have a fuzzy look, similar to how the entire world looks first thing in the morning. Unfortunately, Hexic 2's distortion can't be blinked or washed away. Maybe it's because the playing field is so much bigger than in the original Hexic, but whatever the reason, the distortion is there. A minor concern, especially in the larger scheme of things, but it's still there.  Despite my long list of complaints, Hexic 2 is still a decent puzzle game. I really don't fancy paying $10 for ~decent,~ though. The original Hexic was also an average game, but it was free. It was free, and it was simplistic enough for anyone to grasp right away. Chances are, the original Hexic is still hanging around on most gamers' hard drives. Yes, there is now a sequel, but the original is all anyone, even big fans, will ever need.", "date": "Aug 15, 2007"}
