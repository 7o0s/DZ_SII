It won't spur midnight lineups down at the local software store, and it hasn't exactly kept the online discussion forums hopping with the latest pre-release buzz. Still, it could be a nifty blend of education and entertainment -- a game where you must learn in order to win. It could be an adventure game of sorts, where you spend your time flitting amongst ruins and archeological digs in search ofsomething. It could, like the PR blurb on the back cover says, feature ~brilliant imagery,~ ~amazing effects & sounds,~ and ~intricate puzzles.~   But Lost Worlds does nothing of the sort. Indeed, it may be one of the driest, most uninspired, and most repetitive hunks of gaming software in recent memory. To better understand just what it's like to play the thing, let's put you in the driver's seat and take a gander at what you'll do.    You'll start by enduring the quick but shockingly forgettable Lost Worlds opening -- a static introductory screen and a couple of equally bland menu interfaces. No video, no narration, no glitz, no fun. From there, you'll select one of three worlds -- Mesoamerica, Rome, or Egypt. It doesn't really matter what you select at this point because the drill is the same throughout, and you can always come back and campaign the other two worlds after you've been dragged, sleepily, through the first.   Let's say for the sake of argument you've elected to ~explore~ Mesoamerica. This is precisely where the game could begin dazzling you with rare footage, brilliant photography, excited voice-overs, and awesome displays of CGI mastery. Instead, it underwhelms you with yet one more static photo and a paragraph or two of superimposed text.   If you choose to read that text, you'll learn something moderately interesting about the peoples that inhabited the Mesoamerica zone (roughly equivalent to today's Central America/southern Mexican region) 500 years ago. But you don't need to read or learn anything at all in order to progress successfully through the game. And that's one of the problems with Lost Worlds -- it isn't even a solid edutainment tool.    Regardless, you'll now move into the first of the gameplay interfaces. It is, like every other gameplay interface, based upon a static photograph and a puzzle format. In the first Mesoamerica puzzle, the developer has Photoshopped a given image to alter several details, then presented the original and the modified images side-by-side on the screen. It's your job to spot those differences and click upon the areas in question. ~Spot the Differences~ puzzles have been mainstays in the comics and classified sections of newspapers for decades now, but developer Canopy Games somehow sees fit to present it as one of the central cogs in a $20 computer game. Hmm...   If you do manage to spot all five alterations within the allotted time frame -- and even if you don't -- you merely move on to the second puzzle. There's no pageantry or visual/audible rewards -- just a tally of your score and a new interface.    As time goes on and you somehow jump into the game's other two environments before you visit la-la land, you'll realize Lost Worlds is comprised of four puzzle types. Apart from spotting the differences, you'll be asked to reassemble photographs jigsaw-style, find camouflaged items embedded within photographs, and answer occasional trivia questions. You'll never see a moving image, you'll never be thrust into the middle of the action (of course, there'd need to be action in order for that to happen), and you'll never, ever break free of the standard routine. That the images you do see are far from what is commonly considered high resolution, that the effects and sounds are the very antithesis of what the Lost Worlds PR campaign says is ~amazing,~ and that you'll soon feel you're on a slow-moving train to nowhere is somehow not surprising.    Granted, some of the puzzles are intriguing enough to keep you busy for a few moments, but there's nothing here that hasn't been done better in a gazillion other previously released puzzle games. Furthermore, because the puzzles don't teach or enlighten you as to the game's subject matter, and because the hard info on these ancient civilizations is presented in such a painfully dry manner, you'll inevitably experience a certain disconnect from the game's historical concept. And that leaves us asking why and how The History Channel approved the design in the first place.     On the upside, Lost Worlds demands very little of your system's resources. It's also very easy to play and very easy to navigate. It thusly could be considered a decent enough kid's game, if there weren't already so many other, superior, child-oriented games in this price range.   Lost Worlds would seem to make sense only if you find it in the closeout bin -- which is precisely where it'll end up. Better still, surf on over to the official website (www.lostworldsgamepage.com), where you can find a fully functional 30-minute freebie version. Take it for a spin, learn how hard it sucks, pay no money, and then forget about it.Effectively a series of tweaked, disassembled, or otherwise altered medium-grade photographs and illustrations, The History Channel: Lost Worlds is neither solid edutainment nor exciting entertainment. And it certainly doesn't live up to the fawning PR drool on the game box. It therefore isn't worth your time and certainly not your money.", "date": "Mar 4, 2008"}
