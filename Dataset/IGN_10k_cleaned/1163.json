{"name": "Ferrari F355 Challenge Passione Rossa", "name_review": "F355 Challenge (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/11/f355-challenge-import", "text": "Yu Suzuki likes cars. Fast cars. Fast, low-riding cars. And, oh yes ? they have to look their best when painted red. Needless to say, Big Daddy Yu has something of a Ferrari-fetish, proving that the Italian supercar is the official transport of top-ranking games designers (John Carmack and Yuji Naka both use them for their daily commutes, too). So the father of Virtua Fighter sat out to make the most realistic Ferrari simulation ever created ? and he succeeded with flying colors. However, due to the fact that this is a simulation as opposed to the standard racing game, F355 Challenge is not a game for everybody.  Clearly, F355 is an incredibly focused title. There's only one car in the garage, but that car has been digitally modeled with insane amounts of precision; when you buy F355, you're essentially getting your own customizable Ferrari and a plethora of real-life courses inside that little white box called the Dreamcast. In terms of staunch, unmitigated realism, F355 destroys pretty much every console racing game out there.  But you've got to remember that authentic physics doesn't necessarily ensure a good game ? Square's Driving Emotion Type S was also heralded as a bastion of realism, but the controls made the experience as enjoyable as being kicked in the head multiple times by Bill ~Superfoot~ Wallace. Hence, F355 acknowledges its true-to-life style of driving, and provides the player with copious options and tutorials. The first two modes, Arcade and Single Play, are recreations of the arcade game (Single Play removes the game's timer), and offer three different ways to drive: Training, Free Driving, or Racing.  Though it may seem trite, Training Mode is a must for anyone who wants to play the game seriously (read: in a non-sucky fashion). A red, optimal racing line is painted on the middle of the road, and your goal is to follow it to a T. Sega Rally-style warnings pop up on every corner and chicane, and the game instructs you when to speed up or slow down. The racing line becomes jaggy where you're required to brake, and your invisible mentor will tell you whether or not each turn was successful. I suggest taking going for a spin on the oval Motegi circuit to learn the basic science of driving, cornering, and braking ? you'll be a better person because of it.  Free Driving is essentially Time Attack mode, with other competitors removed from the track. But few things are as terrifying as the actual Race portion of things, where you're pitted against seven other AI drivers. Before you start, remember that this isn't Daytona USA -- all of the cars are F355s, and have similar performance specs; don't expect to blow by a half dozen slowpokes. Since your car is only slightly faster (and possibly slower) than most cars, you need to make up for it on the turns ? though you can remember all of the sneaky little driving optimizations from training mode, sometimes the other guys don't. Still, don't expect miraculous first-place victories within your first few days of training.  For novice drivers (and even some pros), F355 includes four driver-assist systems that can be turned on or off at any time. Stability control keeps your car from slipping in certain cornering circumstances, traction control makes it easier to stay on the road, antilock braking does exactly what you'd expect it to do, and the Intelligent Braking System slows you down for each turn. I'd recommend killing IBS as quickly as possible ? the game tends to brake very conservatively. After a week with the game, I began slowly turning off the assist systems, essentially removing the game's training wheels; my times have been improving ever since.  There's also some tweaking to be found in the car setup screen, where camber, ride height, and other subtle changes can be made. To be honest, I left these pretty much as-is ? if you don't know what you're doing, you can quickly reduce the game to an unplayable mess. Change the color and leave everything else alone, 'kay?   The tracks themselves look miraculous, offering the most realistic recreations of real-life raceways that you've ever seen. There's also a ton of them ? six courses are available from the start of the game, and five more are gradually unlocked after you race a set number of kilometers. It looks like AM2 has finally gone out of their way to beef up an arcade game's replay value, and I salute that effort. The game also offers a championship mode, where you pound through all of the courses and maintain your number-one ranking. I am not ashamed when I state that I have been unable to beat this mode ? it's one helluva challenge.  And if you're in the mood for even more humiliation, the game features a ~network race~ option from the main menu. This allows you to download ghost-car data from the internet or your buddies, and see how you fare against their performances. (Eventually, Sega will be uploading data from real Ferrari drivers ? that should be a lesson in humility.)  And then we have the graphics. Oh, sweet lord. The AM2 boys have pushed the visual envelope for racing games with this one ? the cars look magnificent (even when there are eight of them on screen at once), the tracks are packed with detail, and the texture work is extraordinary. There also is no pop-in whatsoever, and the game maintains 60fps with no slowdown. In the Long Beach course, you can see polygonal skyscrapers that are miles away, and the familiar Ferris Wheel and roller coaster track is visible from every point in the Suzuka Short track. And don't get me started when it comes to racing at sunset ? if only we could choose the ~Magic Weather~ before each race. This feat of graphics programming extends to the split-screen mode, which also holds a steady sixty frames for two-player enjoyment.  That's not to say that F355 is perfect. There are a few arcadey omissions, such as the lack of visible car damage, and colliding with cars and objects can yield odd results from time to time. I'm hoping that night driving or rainy weather will be added to the inevitable sequel ? along with a 3rd  person camera view, since some folks like to play from behind-the-car perspective.  There's also the musical soundtrack, which fits in perfectly with the Japanese fascination for Mr. Big -- yes, it's the return of 80's thrash rock, complete with an irritating DJ who blathers on about how ~The next song's full of velocity!~ This would be completely palatable if the same songs didn't play in the same order every time you played. Kill the BGM and turn on something else instead.  The bottom line? F355 Challenge is basically the driving-game equivalent to Virtua Fighter. The initial learning curve is pretty steep, and may turn off casual gamers who prefer the simplicity of, say, Wacky Races. However, if you're looking for a game that you can play the hell out of all summer long, you'll probably find your calling with F355. Import if you're impatient ? but I'd hold off for Acclaim's full US treatment. -- Colin ~Outrunna~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 11, 2000"}
