Major League Soccer has pulled off a coup to get affiliated with the best soccer video game franchise in the world. In addition to hundreds of international squads, you can now choose from 12 MLS teams to begin play. More than 250 MLS players ensure the distinct style of North American ~futbol~ for the first time in an EA Sports soccer game. Then again, people from Europe and Latin America would say this ~distinct style~ is a gentler term for ~boring.~  Gameplay Yes, international soccer may be more exciting to watch as a fan, but when it comes to playing on the virtual field, it's fun no matter what country you choose because you control their destiny. Prove the world wrong by winning an international tournament with the NY/NJ Metrostars.   Good games always provide tons of variety and remain appealing for quite some time. In FIFA 2000, you get up-to-date rosters from 15 of the world's top leagues, not to mention 40 more classic teams -- a first for the franchise. If you do the math, that's a lot of ballclubs and a ridiculous talent pool of players. Here are some of the timeless international squads in the game:   AC Milan 1988-1990 Argentina 1978 Barcelona 1989-1992 Bayern Munich 1974-1976 Denmark 1989-1992 Hamburg 1982-1983 Independiente 1972-1975 Liverpool 1977-1984 Manchester United 1968 NY Cosmos 1972-1975 Real Madrid 1950-1956   Pick two of the best teams in history or match a modern dynasty against an older one. You can even play an exhibition game between D.C. United of the MLS and the Brazilian national team from 1970. Simply put, there are almost no limits.   The AI is also better this time around. On advanced levels, opposing teams counter your moves if you use em too much. As a counter-attack, strikers can squeeze through defenders with the new shielding option. Press R1while you're moving to protect the ball from incoming tacklers or when you're about to receive a pass in a crowd. If you do it right, the only thing between you and the net is that goalie. Just deke him out and your team is on the board. If he deflects it out of bounds, set up the lob for a classic volley, bicycle kick or header. These are more advanced options, but very familiar to FIFA 99 aficionados. This game gives you plenty of ways to score- it's up to you to learn the different techniques.  Graphics When you talk about motion capture animation, EA Sports is easily the frontrunner in the industry. For FIFA 2000, developers called on numerous pros from Major League Soccer, including Eddie Pope and Roy Lassiter of the D.C. United, Steve Ralston of the Tampa Bay Mutiny, goalie Mark Dodd of the Dallas Burn and retired defender Cle Kooiman, formerly of the Miami Fusion.   The results are astounding, from goalies all the way to the refs. Before the match, you can watch players run onto the field and stretch. The realistic animation continues during the game as well. Attackers have little difficulty deking the opponent with spin moves, flickovers and double stepovers, while defenders show their love for physical contact by aggressively tackling opponents. You'll see giant collisions and players falling over sliding goalies. Even the post-goal celebrations are better than last year. In addition to their customary flips, teams also gather around the scorer and waddle like ducks -- a strange sight indeed.   The lighting, however, in this game can be a drawback. At night, players cast X-shaped shadows as a result of artificial light. While it may be accurate according to the laws of physics, the resulting shadows become major eye sores, just like the cardboard-cutout crowd in the backdrop. On the bright side, the shading during cut-scenes does accentuate the player's physique. Too bad it can't do anything for their faces. This isn't a cheap shot to futbol players across the globe. It's just that compared to what I've seen on the PC version, the 3D sculpted faces are less than stellar on the PS. That's all.  Sound ~Right about now... the Funk Soul Brother... Check it out now... the Funk Soul Brother.~ That's the famous refrain from Fatboy Slim's ~Rockafeller Skank,~ a song featured on the FIFA 99 soundtrack way before mainstream radio stations got a hold of it in the States. Fatboy's tune was one of many underground UK tracks featured in FIFA 99. It brought real international flavor to the game, and for the first time ever, I enjoyed the wait during those awful ~now loading~ screens to hear more music.  This year, the soundtrack is headlined by former Take That sensation and current European heartthrob, Robbie Williams. His song ~It's Only Us~ can be heard throughout the game. You'll also find performances by Reel Big Fish, Lunatic Calm, Elite Force and Sniper, as well as the appropriately titled ~Stop the Rock~ by Apollo Four Forty. Although most of the tracks kick butt, I still prefer music from FIFA 99. Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, just has more spunk than Robbie Williams, though he's a bad boy in his own right. (If you can't tell, I'm not into the ~boy band~ scene.)I vividly remember playing soccer games developed by EA Sports in the past. They were terrible on the PS console, until last year, when FIFA 99 came out of nowhere. This game is very similar to its predecessor, especially concerning gameplay. It's improved in the graphics department, which should make it better than FIFA 99, unless you're a fan of video game soundtracks. The compilation of music from last year's version was one of the best ever put together for a sports title. I think I've stressed that point already. Personally, I enjoy playing FIFA 99 for that reason, but it won't stop me from moving on to this one. I'm a huge proponent of updated rosters, and the addition of Major League Soccer, as well as classic teams, only helps expand the roster.Andy Bhatt", "date": "Nov 3, 1999"}
