{"name": "Atari Greatest Hits", "name_review": "Atari Greatest Hits", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/26/atari-greatest-hits", "text": "Time, like many concepts, is relative.  Nowhere is this fact more readily apparent than in the field of video games, an industry where most products become outclassed, outdated, and downright decrepit no later than a year after their initial release.  When it comes to software, we're not talking about something that's like a fine wine, which becomes more pleasing to the palate as the years pass.  Let's face it, compared to today's flagship titles, most 1980s arcade hits make the late King Tut (or George Burns for that matter) look like Britney Spears.  Just like our favorite jailbait turned teen fox, however, a few classics are worth hitting one more time, which would explain the explosive growth amongst the emulation community in recent years.  And while the widespread availability of arcade-perfect conversions of popular 80s titles via the Internet has all but stemmed the tide of retro craze inspired collections flowing to retail outlets, a few manage to trickle into stores now and again.    Such would be the case of Atari Greatest Hits, Hasbro's salute to the dawn of interactive gaming.  Created from the concept stage with collectors in mind, this package comes complete with twelve fondly remembered games, screen savers, desktop themes, interviews with Nolan Bushnell (Atari's founder), original artwork, obscure factoids, and excerpts from industry accounts.  Bearing this in mind, it becomes apparent that Hasbro isn't merely content to go head to head with the imitators and let them have the last laugh.  Rather than attempting to cash in on nostalgia value alone, the official corporate torch-bearer of the Atari license is fighting back by trying to sell us on something much more valuable than an emulator.  This time, they're hoping that we'll buy into a little piece of history.  Brush those sympathetic tears aside, because it's time to take a stroll down memory lane.  Playing classic button-mashers such as Asteroids, Tempest, Gravitar, Centipede, Millipede, or Asteroids Deluxe, it's hard not to have flashbacks to the days when Boy George and the Thompson Twins ruled the airwaves.  Who could forget working up a sweat at the local arcade as they pounded quarter after quarter into tests of hand-eye coordination such as Pong, Warlords, Super Breakout, or Missile Command?  Surely I'm not the only geek to have been pried off of a Crystal Castles or Battlezone machine by my mother while repeatedly chanting ~j-just...one...m-more...game.~  Despite their annoying tendency to run at a much faster speed than intended on high-end machines, each title is a flawless conversion from its original coin-op form, right down to every beep and boop.    What's more, the power to adjust the basic settings for all of the simulations is now in the player's hands.  The ability to grant extra lives, tweak memory values in order to determine when bonuses are awarded, and adjust difficulty settings is a thrill long-denied to those who weren't lucky enough to own the original coin-ops.  As an unexpected, but welcome twist, it's also possible to bestow ~enhanced graphics~ upon most of the games.  While such enhancements usually amount to little more than a minor boost in visual quality, including the addition of more varied colors and detailed sprites to the playing field, they're still a nice touch.  Even those with an eye for authenticity aren't likely to complain about the inclusion of backgrounds in Warlords or the marquees which border the screen during play time.  I also doubt they'll be any bitching from the peanut gallery when you fire up Asteroids Deluxe in 'trippy mode.'  Although one shouldn't be inclined to expect wonders in terms of the title's presentation, Atari Greatest Hits instantly comes off as one of the most professional and credible 80s collections ever produced.  Above and beyond the games themselves, there's a lot fascinating material to be found in this two-disc set by way of the Atari Archives.  Desktop themes, including wallpaper, sounds, cursors, icons, and more can be installed in ten seconds flat.  A simple, menu-based point and click system lets you sift through the dust of decades and uncover old Atari artwork, promotional materials, and information sheets.  Stories about the rise and fall of some of the biggest names in the business mingle with interviews, fact blurbs, and enough obscure Atari-related trivia to fill up an entire's week's worth of Jeopardy.  Alone, this fascinating mini-encyclopedia justifies the cost of your investment.  Given the sheer volume of material to be found in this set, serious collectors will be hard pressed to find an 80s compilation that's more satisfying than Atari Greatest Hits.  Although the selection of games offered straight out of the box is a bit limited, these classics remain as addictive as ever (and perhaps more so) thanks to an option which lets you save and upload high scores to Hasbro's website. Casual gamers are bound to find this piece of old fartware out of their league, but anyone that spent days on end trying to earn those @#*$! Atari sew-on patches owes it to themself to pick up a copy.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Apr 26, 2000"}
