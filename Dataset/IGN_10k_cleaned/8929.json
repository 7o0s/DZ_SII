So after the immensely playable console games became best seller, it was only fate that the franchise would trickle over to mobile. LEGO Star Wars II actually doesn't trail the original release in America by much time at all, but it definitely shows some improvement over the initial LEGO Star Wars.   LEGO Star Wars II unfolds during the timeline of the original trilogy, tracking Luke's rescue of Leia from the first Death Star. With the help of R2-D2, the pair of heroes braves wave after wave of squat stormtroopers and a healthy amount of block/brick-related puzzles. There is a good balance between shooting action and basic platformer puzzling spread across over fifteen stages. Each stage also has a collection of gold studs for picking up, giving LEGO Star Wars II a scavenger hunt element for players that didn't get enough of that game mechanic during the Nintendo 64 era.   The action scenes are the weakest part of the game. At no point did I ever feel any sort of threat. It's just too easy to get the drop on a stormtrooper and bag him while he's half a screen away. (Although, the animation of the helmet popping off after you score a hit never grew old.) And as soon as you rescue Leia, she serves as automatic back up while handling puzzle elements with Luke and R2.   The exploration and puzzle elements are more engaging. After you pick up R2, you can switch between the characters to manipulate blocks, traverse different surfaces, and access computer terminals. The puzzles aren't necessarily difficult, but they are satisfying to finish.   Developer Universomo smartly makes each stage just a few minutes long so you can jump in and out of LEGO Stars War II with ease. And with the scavenger hunt stuff, the player that loves to see 100% completion will get some additional mileage out of the game.   Much like the first LEGO Star Wars, the camera is pulled so far back from the action that the essence of the LEGO universe is essentially lost. The bird's eye view is great for seeing the entirety of a puzzle, but the characters just look itty-bitty instead of constructed out of LEGOs. Right there, that's half of the game's charm out the window.  LEGO Star Wars II is a decent little adventure with some good puzzle play but decidedly boring action elements. And even though the art shouldn't necessarily affect overall enjoyment, there's a certain amount of disappointment in a game billed LEGO Star Wars that hardly looks, well, LEGO-y. It's a decent download for the Star Wars devotee, but other mobile gamers can find better thrills elsewhere.", "date": "Aug 21, 2007"}
