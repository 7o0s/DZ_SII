Konami's produced two previous Frogger-esque adventures, a side-scrolling platformer, as well as a pixel-perfect port of the original Frogger arcade game in Arcade Advance...and we're not even mentioning the many times he's appeared on the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. And just like any successful franchise, the publisher's milking everything it can out of the poor frog, and Frogger's Journey: The Forgotten Relic is yet another traffic-avoiding game for the handheld, but this time the developers tie the 18 or so levels together in an RPG-style adventure game to extend the playtime. And that's what really kills the game, because the challenges require an enormous amount of tedious, and ultimately unnecessary, sequences that force players to wander the land and chat with characters in order to move onto the next challenge. Boring. Features 18 levels Collectable powers Cartridge save (three slots)  So, like the previous games in the Frogger series, the developers build upon the extremely vague background of Frogger by giving him an adventurous Grandfather. And in Frogger's Journey: The Forgotten Relic, the challenge is to find out what's happened to him after an expedition gone wrong. Players, as Frogger, must get to town and speak with the citizens, many of whom know of Frogger's grandfather and are willing to help out as the storyline progresses. Frogger will have to get through more than 18 different challenges using his jumping abilities without getting ~run over.~ Later in the game the puzzles become even more complex and utilize Frogger's newer abilities, like a super jump, a grappling hook, and a device that temporarily freezes things in place.  For those looking for a tried-and-true Frogger game, this one isn't it. The game doesn't even start out like a Frogger game, forcing players into hopping around the area to talk with the townsfolk in order to unfold the plotline of the game. The character designs are admittedly very cool, with each townfolk personified by a well-drawn humanized animal...it's almost as if Konami wants to branch out Frogger as an animated cartoon. But these portions artificially extend the playtime, and they're just so darn boring to do...Frogger has always been about action, and putting him in the role of an RPG hero just feels wrong.  Only when you actually follow the proper branches in the story will you actually gain access to the Frogger-style levels. And even here the game's broken somewhat. The game is still about the platform hopping and traffic avoiding in four different directions, but for this sequel Frogger now has a healthbar. It's no longer a one-hit death anymore, obviously an inclusion to make the game less frustrating for the younger crowd. Sure, there are places where you'll perish after taking one too many hits, but when health-recovering fruit is plentiful, scattered around the level in strategic locations, it reduces the challenge significantly.  There are some elements that increase the replay of Frogger's Journey: The Forgotten Relic, like the Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance inspired furniture collection and the multiple paths unlocked by using the increasing abilities of Frogger. But this game lacks some of the charm of the last Frogger game on the GBA, Frogger's Adventures 2: The Lost Wand: there's nothing beyond the main quest here, not even additional multiplayer challenges. As much as I liked the previous Frogger games released on the Game Boy Advance, Frogger's Journal takes a turn for the worse by adding too much nonsense and dumbing-down the classic Frogger gameplay. The level designs don't add any new ideas to what's already been done for the series. The game's takes a significant time to get through, but a lot of that is unneeded ~adventuring~ that just doesn't fit the Frogger brand. If the series is to come out on the GBA one more time, hopefully it won't follow the formula created for this one.", "date": "Nov 3, 2003"}
