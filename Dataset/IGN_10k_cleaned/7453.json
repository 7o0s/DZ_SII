Thankfully, it also goes beyond the generic conventions injected into the character and level designs. The adoption of a first-person perspective makes for a wholly absorbing experience, and the clever integration of several different skills trees and some unique gameplay features keeps Dark Messiah feeling fresh and genuinely exciting.   The story explores the well-trodden, 'recover the mystical artifact for your mentor who may not be all that he seems' scenario. The heroic player-character, Sareth, is an orphan raised by the mysterious Phenrig - tutor and magician. He fuses the now-young adult Sareth with a decidedly kinky guardian entity, Xana, and vests him with a mission to recover the Skull of Shadows.   Dispatching grunts with a bit of chop-socky action.  The Sareth/Xana love-hate relationship is pretty entertaining. She is effectively a jaded voice in Sareth's head, acting as an occasional hint-giver and keeping him on the path to his objectives. Beyond this, there's her oft-spoken allusions towards rewards of sexual gratification and her constant jealousy of Leanna - a butter-wouldn't-melt-in-her-mouth junior wizard (wizardess? Witch? Who knows) and an obvious love interest whom you'll be spending plenty of quality time with by the end of the game.   Menelag, Leanna's Uncle and ruler of the kingdom is obsessed with the Skull of Shadows, and yearns to unlock its secrets at any cost. You're out to stop him. But you're not sure why, exactly, he poses a threat, or why your mentor wants it for himself. Effectively, you're stealing from one despot to potentially give to another.   Developed by Arkane Studios, the team chose to base the game on a modified version of the Source engine - the famed engine that powered Half-Life 2 - and it shows. As much as the world of Ashan is fairly predictable fantasy fare, the game itself plays a lot like its predecessor. Physics-based environments are heavily emphasized - far more so than even Bethesda's recent opus Oblivion. The puzzles are far better implemented and occur much more often.   That said, beyond the physics, few other comparisons to Oblivion hold water. Unsurprisingly, Dark Messiah sticks to a fairly linear plotline. This is no bad thing since, in the space of twelve lengthy chapters, the pacing rarely wanes and you're never stuck pondering your next objective.    Puzzles-wise, many of the game's more thoughtful and interesting moments are cleverly scripted for moments of key tension and exhilaration. A rooftop chase sequence early in the game is fast and just precarious enough to be genuinely thrilling. In pursuing a scurrying Gollum-like creature in pursuit of a key quest item, you have mere moments to scramble across awnings and through open windows in a deft combination of platforming skills and problem-solving. Branching paths are minimal, however; you're more likely to find yourself taking a jump onto a board that splinters and send you plummeting to the unforgiving soil below, forcing a rethink of your approach and cautious footwork. Autosaving is very well implemented too - saving at key moments to avoid bouts of severe frustration at having to redo a load of do-or-die leaps of faith.     Interspersed throughout the levels are numerous side-quests and secrets, ranging in complexity from reading a note that leads to a new area or uncovering a secret switch that leads to a weapons cache or unique enchanted item. Endless quiver, anyone? Yes, please. Other side-quests ask you to take advantage of clever level design and a grappling hook-style 'rope-bow' to climb and jump from point to point.   There are no character classes as such in Dark Messiah. Instead, the game adopts a familiar ability-tree system that allows you to customise Sareth's abilities to your taste. Divided into three major skill areas, Strength, Magic and Stealth, you gain experience through slaying enemies and apply experience points into whatever branch you want to pursue.   Early levels allow for a varied approach to most situations. Though taking a few cues from the seminal Thief series of stealth gameplay and allowing first-strike sneak attacks, the AI prevents you from making silent takedowns. They holler for help and attack without mercy in packs.    Subtle lighting and some very cool spellcraft.   Combat is a balanced dance of mouse-directed swordplay, combined with parrying via the right mouse button and power attacks. These powerful lunges and slashes are activated by holding down the left mouse button hitting W, A, S or D and releasing. The result is a swing that deals extra damage and a successful strike builds your adrenaline bar.   The adrenaline bar acts as a power gauge that, once filled, unleashes an impressive slow-motion, one-hit-kill - we're talking disembowelment, dismemberment or beheading with lashes of gore all over the place. Such power strikes take practice to master and learning how to parry is an essential skill.   Also of critical importance is learning how to plant your foot into the chest of an oncoming orc or henchman. Utilising the Source Engine's physics code, you can send enemies stumbling backwards and through wooden walls, over ledges and into razor-sharp rows of spikes. Leaping down onto the heads of enemies will knock them on their rear. If a foe is knocked into the water, it spells instant death - kind of a cheap quirk and one that is easily exploited on latter levels set on docks, faced with the defense of a ship.   Magic, predictably dominated by mana usage, is a point and click affair. Hitting tab raises the inventory screen, where it's a simple enough task of assigning a shortcut key to your number keys for any spells or weapons you want, World of Warcraft style. You have almost 40 item slots to play with, and no weight limit, by the way, so you're rarely forced to sacrifice weapons or items for the sake of space.    The mix of brute force, spell casting and blade-work work well together. Combined with the ability to lift boxes, barrels, crates and a host of inanimate objects, you're never short of something to hurl or a clever way of inflicting pain. Jars of oil, when tossed to the floor, can be set alight, causing enemies to burst into flames on contact; characters that are frozen via magical means become solid blocks of ice that balance precariously on their feet. They're just begging to be kicked, and who are we to deny them of that?    It is possible to forge your own blades from bars of iron, steel and precious flamegold. Unlike the very basic crafting of most fantasy games, Dark Messiah ramps up the immersion by prodding players to physically place a bar of steel into a furnace and liquefy it, mold the blade, heat it and hammer it into shape. Then, place the blade to a hilt maker and wrap it in leather. The end result is a finely crafted weapon of superior strength, and a gameplay feature that is impressively well-implemented. A few more materials and some control over the design of the blade or hilt would be nice, however. Likewise, there is no simulated liquid effect when pouring the liquid into the mold - another little thing that would've been nice to see included.   Beautiful character designs feature throughout.  Although it's nice to see a first-person game that doesn't hammer us over the heads with bump-mapping ala Unreal Engine 3, the graphics provided by Source range from eye-popping to shockingly dated looking. The texturework varies greatly - characters are nicely rendered, particularly Leanna, who is a fox. Orcs and goblins look like they were ripped from The Two Towers and are nicely animated. But environmental detail is lacking in polygons - the trees look pitifully sparse and blocky, for instance.   Other strange little shortcuts appear, such as decidedly low-resolution sprite-based rope makes a poor argument for 'why use a polygon when a sprite will do?' Sure, it doesn't affect the gameplay, but it is definitely noticeable enough to players out of the experience. It dulls the sheen of the presentation and does an injustice to the art department's obvious skill.   Water effects, HDR lighting and full-body awareness of key characters are all impressive. The Pao Kai - a terrifically detailed species of dragon - are sequence steelers, and show how capable the art department is when they're clearly having some fun. Again, heavily inspired by Weta's Lord of the Rings school of design, but gorgeous and authentic nonetheless.   Sound design, oft-overlooked by players, is very nicely executed and is, more importantly, fundamental to the gameplay. With a good surround sound setup, environmental audio breathes life into the world. Tramping through the cobblestone streets of small townships, all manner of subtle aural details present themselves to the listener. Everything from the movement of air to the casual conversations and unobtrusive, situation-specific music to the crunch of bones underfoot and the squelchy stick of the webbed floor of a spider's den sound exactly as they should. Hearing the shrill squeal of a Pao Kai in the distance is enough to raise hairs.   32 player multiplayer, developed separately by Kuju entertainment, is also included - at time of testing, we were unable to play through this. Rest assured however, that we will definitely be tackling this aspect in an upcoming feature. As it stands, the game combines distinct classes absent from the single player and combines them with team-based, territory-capturing gameplay.   Dark Messiah of Might and Magic is an excellent blend of fantasy and hardcore action. The scripted sequences are some of the coolest weve witnessed this side of Half-Life 2, and its no surprise that the Source engine is responsible for generating some brilliant gravity-gun-free physics joy. The first time you hurtle a barrel at a pair of orcs, one in front of the other, and watch as they both get impaled against a wall of spikes, youll squeal your giddy buttocks off.It isnt perfect, and the graphical shortcuts and occasionally cheap gameplay mechanics prevent it from attaining the elusive instant classic status. But there is no denying that Dark Messiah is brilliant fun, beautiful and compelling with enough originality to warrant purchase by fans of the series and gamers looking for a more action-oriented RPG. Captivating stuff.", "date": "Oct 26, 2006"}
