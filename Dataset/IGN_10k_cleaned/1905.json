The American Civil War pretty much owns the nineteenth century wargames market in this country and, while a game about the Crimean or the Mexican War would be even more interesting, a game about Napoleon is a nice enough change of pace. For those of you who don't know, Antietam offered a superb real-time simulation of regimental warfare. Now that same method is being applied to the last of the Little Corporal's battles, Waterloo.  While this game is based on the Antietam engine (itself based on the Gettysburg engine), a lot of changes have been made to reflect the differences between Napoleonic and Civil War battles.  For one thing, the role of cavalry has been increased substantially to better reflect their historical importance. They are much more involved in the action than Civil War cavalry and must become a key factor in any of your tactical decisions. Napoleonic battles relied much more on a combination of different types of units -- cavalry would threaten infantry, infantry would respond by forming squares, these squares then become more vulnerable to artillery, etc. This rock-paper-scissors approach totally pays off here and the AI is really, really, really good at making it work. New formations have been added for this game including square, massed column, attack column or mixed order.   Waterloo preserves the strengths of the engine. First and foremost, the perception of battle as abstract geometry is strong here. While real generalship goes much deeper, this game is all about moving shapes of men against other shapes. Unit movement and formation control is just as simple and flexible as it could possibly be. A few new commands have been added to smooth the gameplay somewhat, but a lot more control has been added at the highest level of command. The fire cones, which were such a great feature of Antietam, are thankfully preserved here to give you an immediate indication of who's getting hit with what.   Waterloo isn't a great leap forward in terms of graphics. In fact, it doesn't look nearly as sharp as Antietam did when it was originally released. The unit sprites are small and indistinct but the attention to detail shown on the uniforms is nothing short of astounding. Students of the battle will be able to tell the difference between the Old Guard and the German Legion pretty easily. With each unit dressed in a distinct style, recognition becomes a little easier. This time around, smoke from volleys has been added to give the game an added sense of realism. On the sound side, the game won't knock you out. Battle sounds and unit acknowledgements are sharp (and delivered in the appropriate dialect) but the music is sorely lacking.  The landscape, while still kind of unsightly, contains all of the historical landmarks from the Chateau Hougoumont to the Planenoit Church. I would have liked to have seen a stronger contrast between the different elevations in the game; the perspective makes it hard to determine where the high ground is. There is a feature to emphasize the elevations, but it doesn't do that much good. Waterloo also adds buildings that your infantry can occupy. Infantry in a building suffer much less damage than infantry in the open.  A few other changes have been incorporated. The Order of Battle (OOB - a listing of all the units under your command) is constantly updated while the game is played. This way you can keep an eye on which of your units are suffering the highest number of casualties either in men or morale. It'd be great to jump to a particular unit from the OOB, but this feature wasn't included. An overall army morale status has been added to reflect high level motivation changes for your entire army. This seems a little much to me, since morale is rendered at the unit level as well. Furthermore, the decision to decrease overall morale in proportion to the number of active friendly units on the battlefield just seems counterintuitive to me.  You can square off as supreme commander of either the Grand Armee or The Army of the Low Countries in over 30 separate scenarios. And while the scenarios are fairly self-contained, they all simulate larger or smaller portions of the battle at Waterloo. Of course, the Iron Man mode recreates the entire battle of Waterloo from start to finish. With plenty of historical ~what-if?~ problems, there's very little risk that you'll grow tired of this one anytime soon. And with the accompanying editor and GameSpy assisted multiplayer, Waterloo has a lot of play options.  Without a significant facelift, this is probably the last time we'll be seeing this engine. It's already showing its age but, as if to prove the point about gameplay being more important than graphics, I've had a lot of fun with this one. Hopefully, the core of the engine will be used as the basis for further games. We might even be so lucky as to get a simulation of the Alamo or the Siege of Sevastopol or some other such ~Great Battle.~ Waterloo does a lot in the meantime to get you through until then but, on the whole, I think Antietam is still more fun.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
