I can say for myself that Risk is the game that taught me crush my opponents mercilessly and when I found out that MacSoft was bringing Hasbro's Risk II to the Mac, I was ecstatic. The last Mac computer version of Risk was okay, but nothing compared to tour de force that is Risk II. Not only did the game designers successfully translate the board game, they actually made improvements to this all time classic.    In the board game version of Risk, the only way to play is turn based. Risk II offers the best computer simulation of Classic Risk ever made. The game allows you to establish at the beginning what the game play rules are, which include a wide variety of victory conditions and play variables. To win, you can either take 60%, 80% or 100% of the map. You can also take and hold opponent capitals or achieve mission goals. For added variety, you can turn on a number of new countries on the map that create new gateways between continents. In the Americas, they've added Hawaii as a link to Asia and the Faulklan Islands as a gateway between South America and Africa. There is also a new gateway between South America and Australia, as well as a new connection between Africa and Asia. Turning on any number of these new countries and gateways dramatically changes the strategy of the game and adds a lot of new possibilities for long time players.   Placing and acquiring armies has also been ~augmented.~ Trading in cards can be done on either an escalating or set value schedule. The escalating value is the one that will be most familiar to players, as each successive set of cards traded in gives the player a higher number of armies. The set value schedule gives each player the same number of units per hand turned in. Placing armies can be done either randomly or players can choose their countries one at a time. New to the computer game is an Election placement mode. In Election, players bid on countries in an attempt to win over the population. Bidding on a country that borders one the player already owns lowers the cost of the winning bid. Election is a complex and time consuming way to start a game, but it adds a completely new level of strategy to the game.    While Classic Risk is definitely a fun way to play, Risk II introduces a new way, Same Time Risk. Each player makes decisions at the same time during each phase of the game, reinforcing, attacking, and tactical moves. The way it works, at the beginning of the game, each player occupies a number of countries that were either assigned randomly or chosen by the players. After country assignment, each player places their reinforcements without knowing where your opponents are placing theirs. After the initial placement of your armies, reinforcement is a little different. You can only place 1 army in a territory plus 1 army for each bordering territory you own. If you have two contiguous countries, you can place two armies in each. If you have one country with two friendly borders, that country can have three armies. At the end of the reinforcement round, each players decisions are revealed and you move on to attacking.   Attack mode is perhaps the most different from Classic Risk. First off, the dice are different. Each player gets a single die, but it is a 12 sided die. Depending on the number of armies you are attacking or defending with, there are more or less high numbers. For example, if you have less than 5 armies, you will play with a white die that mostly has 1s, 2s, and 3s. Six and up and you get the yellow die, that has more 2s, 3s, and 4s. There are several level of die going up to the very deadly black die that is almost all 5s and 6s. The higher the power of the die, the more armies it will kill when it wins. The second dice change is that in a tie, the attacker wins.    But wait, there's more! You can attack a single country from multiple territories at once. If you have three territories with 3 armies each that border a single territory with 5 armies, each of your three territories can attack that single country with two armies. The way it plays out, you will end up with a total of 6 armies to the defender's 5. You will also be playing with 3 dice, one for each attacking territory. If you roll a 5 a 4 and a 2, and the defender rolls a 2, the defender would lose 3 armies. If you had rolled a 1 instead of a 2, the defender would lose 2 armies and you wouldn't lose any. The downside is that if the defender had rolled a 6, each one of your attacking territories would have lost 1 army. In Same Time Risk, defenders are always at a disadvantage, because they lose in a tie. To negate that disadvantage, layers can engage in border disputes. If two bordering territories attack each other, it is a border clash and no one has the advantage. This is a good point to keep in mind when large forces are arrayed against you. As a defender, you will almost definitely lose, but in a border clash, you have a fighting change. Because each player plans their attacks at the same time, when an attacking army takes a territory, it can't attack any more territories, which is the exact opposite from Classic Risk. There is one exception, you can plan in the attack planning phase to use a single Surge Attack to make a second attack from one invaded territory. Surge Attacks often make a big difference in the flow of a game.    Risk, in any play mode, is at its core a multiplayer game. You can play over TCP/IP or AppleTalk networks or you can play against the computer. Network games are by far the least predictable, but if you don't have friends you can play against the computer has nearly a dozen unique AIs to play against. Some are harder than others and each one has a very distinct playing style. I have managed to win nearly every game against the computer, but there are three or four very aggressive AIs that are brutal to play against and are a definite challenge.   Ever since we got this game, the entire staff has been playing Risk II non-stop. There's no question that this is the best computer translation of the board game ever made. If you are a long time Risk player, there are enough new features packed in here to get your blood moving. If you've never played Risk before, Risk II makes it very easy learn the rules and get playing. Bottom line here is that MacSoft's Risk II is a winner.", "date": "Jun 10, 2002"}
