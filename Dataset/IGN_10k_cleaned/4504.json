Boldly striding where chickens fear to tread, the titular toad has been kicking around arcades and video game consoles for over twenty years. He has transcended vids -- Frogger has been on the receiving end of tribute songs, a ~Seinfeld~ episode, and a Saturday morning cartoon series. And now his plight comes to your wireless handset. Can you help this poor fella reach the other already?  Features:  Classic arcade game Two visual styles Full sounds Scoreboard  Konami has been squeezing the frog for all he's worth in recent years, plopping him in a series of disposable console games that sought to cash in on the sheer popularity of the name-brand. But Upstart Games and Konami bring the bugger back to his roots in this to-go portion of the grand arcade classic.  Everybody knows the pitiful tale of the toad. He must reach the other side of a busy freeway, navigate across treacherous waters, and nestled himself in one of five bogs at the top of the screen. (Forget all these psycho-babble discourses on the profound philosophical questions of ~The Matrix~ and ~The Sopranos~ -- Frogger Is the original existential piece of pop culture. )Should one pixel of his being come into to contact with his numerous hazards, all that remains is a grim skull.  Frogger is really the perfect game for a handset. It only requires the use of the touchpad. There are no ~Action~ buttons to worry about - just up, down, left, and right. Controls as simple as these are darn near impossible to screw up, and as expected from Upstart Games' amazing track record thus far, Frogger plays like a champ.  Recognizing that a great number of vidders have really only seen Frogger in his latter-day manifestations, Upstart and Konami wisely chose to include two visual schemes for the game. One bears a resemblance to the soft, rounder, more anthropomorphic frog that shares more in common with Kermit than those annoying Budweiser frogs. The other is pure classic arcade mode - which is the way it should be played.  Frogger had more of the more memorable themes in the arcade, which is faithfully recreated for this wireless version. Yes, the review for Frogger seems short, but by now, youre in one of two camps  those that like Frogger, and the pathetically lame. Fans of the frog that love the original will need to immediately lick this off their carriers servers, as it is arcade gaming at its purest: fun, fun, and simple.", "date": "Feb 29, 2004"}
