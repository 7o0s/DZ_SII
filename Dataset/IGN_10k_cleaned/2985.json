The latest rendition of this classic digging action-puzzle game has hit the Game Boy Advance in a decent package that continues the original design's charms while adding a few elements of its own. And the multiplayer mode isn't anything to scoff at, either. Features Sixty different levels Classic mode Link cable support for four players (single cartridge) Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance  Kemco's Vision Works team (Top Gear GT) has been working on this game for quite some time, and after a good year in development, Game Boy Advance owners can experience the taxing joy of the classic Boulder Dash game design. Boulder Dash EX lifts elements from the original game published by First Star Software (remember Spy vs. Spy?), and pushes it forward with a few new twists to make the puzzles even more challenging.  Like the original Boulder Dash, players tunnel themselves through several dozen different 2D puzzles, collecting enough gems to exit the level and move onto the next. Even though your character can move anywhere on the screen, boulders are affected by the forces of gravity; by removing dirt or items under boulders, you'll cause them to fall towards the bottom of the screen. If you or an enemy happen to get underneath a plummeting rock, it's squishville...bad if you're flattened, but definitely good if a bad guy goes splat. You can hold up a rock from falling by remaining under it before it falls...which is a skill you'll definitely have to learn since some of the later puzzles require this technique quite a lot.  The Game Boy Advance EX version takes this idea further with lots of new additions, including a cheesy story about a young anime cat and his kidnapped girlfriend. Your character (said anime cat) can now take more than one hit...and if you're lucky, you can replenish your power bar by picking up mushrooms sprinkled around specific levels. The GBA game features several different enemies, each with their own attack patterns; some work with gravity, some only move vertically, some only move horizontally...and some hug around the edges of the level's blocks. Players can pick up specific power-ups that do different things in the level: An arrow icon will rotate the level clockwise or counter-clockwise, changing the layout of the level...gravity is still pulling downward, so boulders and gems will topple and settle into their new position when this happens. Players can also utilize grapple arms and bombs as they find them in a level. With all of these new elements in place, there's a lot more thought involved in solving each of the levels in the game than the original Boulder Dash design. The first two dozen levels are pretty easy, but halfway through the game's 60 levels you'll find yourself stumped more times than you can count...luckily you have an unlimited amount of lives and tries during each level, and your progress is auto-saved to cartridge.  Also new to the game is a clever little multiplayer game that utilizes all of the established gameplay elements, but puts up to four players in the arena set out to drop rocks and bombs on each other. Kemco obviously didn't realize what it had here when the company shipped this game, because the documentation says that each system requires a copy of the game...but it fully supports single cartridge multiplayer. It makes perfect sense that the always-welcome multi-boot mode is supported, since the game's graphics are as basic as you can get on the Game Boy Advance. The colors are certainly vibrant, but the game only uses a dozen or so different tiles for the level layouts, and there are only a handful of different enemy sprites to face. The development team fleshed out the cartridge with really good artwork for the trading cards that you can collect by performing specific tasks, like squashing enemies with rocks.  And it wouldn't be a retrogaming revisit without the original game, and you get that in Boulder Dash EX, too. Vision Works recreated the 1984 PC classic in its entirety on the Game Boy Advance, right down to the nasty CGA graphics and tinny single-channel PC speaker sound. The gameplay is distinctly different from the Kemco remake, so you might find yourself in this mode longer than you expect...if you can stand the classic's irritating, choppy scrolling and non-existent animation. Don't get me wrong, it's  charming as heck to see the original running on the GBA, but we've come so far since then. The story and cutscenes are a little on the tacky side, and the graphics might not be the most elaborate seen on the GBA, but Boulder Dash EX is quite a fun, little surprise. You won't exactly cruise through the game's sixty levels, but it is only about five hours before it's all over. The classic version is another set of levels that'll keep you occupied, having enough replay value for those short pick-up-and-play gaming sessions. And the multiplayer mode, only requiring a single cartridge for up to four players, is another addition that makes the game worth a purchase.", "date": "Sep 27, 2002"}
