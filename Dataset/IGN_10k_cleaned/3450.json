{"name": "The Sum of All Fears", "name_review": "Sum of All Fears", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/02/21/sum-of-all-fears", "text": "One of Ubi Soft's first titles released for the Game Boy Advance was the company's 2001 Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear, a 2D-ized version of Red Storm's tactical action-strategy series that saw quite a bit of success on the PC and consoles. The game had its ups and downs, but ultimately it was a bit too far on the complicated side, especially for the Game Boy Advance and its limiting controls. For Sum of All Fears, Ubi Soft took what it created with Rogue Spear on the GBA, and ~dumbed~ it down for a more action-oriented game design. Unfortunately, with the game turning from its strategic design to a more sneak-and-shoot layout, Sum of All Fears becomes old and stale very quickly since there's no real variety in the missions. It's fun for what it is, but there really needs to be more stuff to do. Features 15 missions Campaign and Lone Wolf modes Link cable support for four players Cartridge save (five slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Sum of All Fears only shares the situation from the recent movie based upon a Tom Clancy novel, so don't expect to see Ben Affleck or Morgan Freeman to show up to pat yourself on the back after a job well done. Like the portable version of Rogue Spear (and to lesser effect, Rainbow Six on the Game Boy Color), players control a team of four operatives and take them into the heat of battle, taking out terrorists and rescuing hostages in a total of fifteen different missions. Each mission has a primary and secondary objective to complete, but if the first objective is met, the mission ends and moves on...which is slightly annoying, as players will have to finish the second objective first in order to complete both. Players will have to use a bit of strategy before heading into the action, as the choice of team members are completely up to them; some members are quicker, quieter, or more accurate than others, but if they die in the line of duty, they're gone for good. Bummer.  The game interface and engine is lifted right out of Rogue Spear, so players already familiar with the Rainbow Six game will be in recognizable territory in Sum of All Fears. However, a lot of functionality has been pulled out for Sum in order to make it more accessible to the casual gamer. This decision is both good and bad. In this game, players now won't be overwhelmed with the need to set strategies for each of the members of the team, which makes it a more inviting action game that doesn't intimidate with a whole lot of complex extras. However, without the extra goodies and functions of the previous game, it doesn't leave a whole lot for the gamer to do, other than run in each of the areas with guns blazing. And since players can't tell their other three members of the team to stay put, or do something else, these teammates have nothing better to do than to follow the leader along the path given to them by the lead soldier. And this causes some serious problems if the player happens to cluster the team together: there's no friendly fire in Sum, so if a teammate happens to get in the way when you're blasting away at an enemy, well, he's going to get hit by your weapon fire.  But even though the controls have been dumbed down from Rogue Spear there's a large amount of commands accessible to the player, which means certain functions have to share buttons. But some actions can't be used during other actions, which actually makes the controls a bit too clunky for their own good. If a player's holding down the L trigger to strafe, and want to manually aim a sniper weapon (L button and B button together), they have to let go of the L button, and repress it with the B button to activate it. Ick.  Because the engine is most likely lifted out of the Rogue Spear development, Sum of All Fears shares the same appearance as its semi-prequel. The character sprites may be small and lack color detail, but the animation is really well done; like when the soldiers pause to reload their weapon. The sound is much more impressive, as the digitize sound effects of weapon fire, or voice samples of the soldiers, hostages, and enemies belt out of the GBA speaker without any compression muffling. Very nice.   But you read it correctly above: there are only fifteen missions in the game, which won't take more than about three hours to go through. The replay incentive comes through unlocking the extra ~Lone Wolf~ campaign, which lets players go through the existing missions without any back-up. It's a lot tougher, but you also don't have to deal with the stupid intelligence of the other three soldiers getting in the way. And making a return is the cooperative and competitive link cable modes for multiple players (letting players separate the soldiers during the missions)...definitely adding to the lasting ability of Sum of All Fears. Rogue Spear on the Game Boy Advance was a little too complex for the casual gamer. Sum of All Fears isn't complex enough. The developers needed to hit that middle ground to find the successful design. As it is, Sum of All Fears is fun and challenging, but the missions are pretty much the same with almost no change in variety. The game looks good and sounds great, there just needs more stuff to do.", "date": "Feb 21, 2003"}
