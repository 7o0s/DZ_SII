Originating in 1998, Dragon Quest Monsters (Dragon Warrior Monsters, here in America) was Square's answer to the Pokemon craze.  Teaming its series characters with turn-based battle perfected for nearly a decade before, Dragon Quest Monsters seemed to have the best of both worlds, as it became an instant pocket classic.  Now nearly a decade - and a few Japan-only releases - later, Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker is making its return to the US, and it's a pretty decent homecoming indeed.   Monster collection games are never too story-intensive, and DQMJ doesn't break that mold too much.  You'll play as a young boy whose father belongs to a mysterious organization known as CELL.  After being imprisoned for your negligent behavior - more specifically, your want to join the world's most prestigious monster-battling league - your father releases you under one condition; you must participate in a secret mission for CELL, working within the league to carry out the syndicate's needs.  After some token RPG lecturing during the front end of the game, you hop on your neo-tech jet ski and head for unknown lands.   It's good to be 3D.  Doing battle.   The real question here isn't whether or not the RPG mechanics and gameplay work - it's Square, it's the Dragon Quest series, and it's nothing overly daunting for the team overall - but whether DQM keep the core experience of the DQM franchise during its move to DS, and how different it is from previous iterations or system competition.  For the most part DQM is exactly how you'll remember it, now with one hell of a face lift, a bit more depth overall, and a lack of randomly-generated dungeons.  Dragon Quest Monsters feels more like a legitimate Dragon Quest game that just so happens to be part of the Monsters series, rather than a scaled down, patchwork adventure.     Don't get us wrong, we loved DQM back in the day; it was just amazingly simple in context.  You'd jump into a dungeon, battle, capture new monsters, and use them to fight in a coliseum.  In Joker you feel like you're truly adventuring through new areas, interacting with a living world, fighting monsters that are actually there (due mostly to the fact that all battles can now be seen in the overworld, letting you ignore/seek them out as you see fit), and really going somewhere.  In short, DS's Dragon Quest Monsters experience is less about the level-to-level grind, and more about the reason for powering up your characters in the first place.  It's about battle, yes, but it's more adventure focused as well; something the series lacked before.    As far as the core mechanic goes though, the game is intact, and should definitely surprise some newcomers to the franchise in the sheer amount of depth and versatility it presents.  The game is inhabited with over 200 monsters, some of which are returning from the old games, and some of which are new.  You can carry up to three members in your team at any given time, each able to fully level up, skill up, and be equipped as if you've got full-fledged RPG characters rather than animal-like monsters in something like Pokemon.  The scouting system in DQMJ, which is basically a non-lethal form of combat used to try and persuade enemy monsters into joining your group, is an excellent system.      Rather than working on a tier-based system, scouting determines a percentage rate for the monster's conversion, and then simulates a dice roll.  This means a dedicated trainer - or a masochistic one - could sit in front of a nearly impossible monster at 2% scout rate and try over and over again to convert them.  Statistically, it would eventually happen.  For some this might seem like an odd decision, but there's something far more real about making it an actual chance-vs.-percentage situation, as you never get that ~Oh, the game creators don't want me getting this guy yet~ feeling that you normally would.   Joker is also extremely versatile in your overall strategy with the team.  You can focus specific monsters in different categories, breed them and pass on one of three skill sets into totally unique monsters, or even change the amount of control you have over battles.  This is a great addition to battles, as you can easily say ~Fight~ and watch them decimate smaller opponents, or narrow it down to specific strategies for each monster instead.  If you want to go as far as commanding exact moves to each monster every turn, that's also included.  The speed and overall ease of switching up strategies combines with the lack of random battles this time around, making DQM feel faster, more natural, and totally streamlined.   A killer team.  Time to breed it up!   We still have some gripes with the game though.  For starters, the 3D lends itself well to the DS, but it has its issues, specifically in the general control that comes with d-pad/3D gameplay, and in the system's technical limits.  Control can be a bit stiffer than other 3D games on the system, often including some odd collision in the world most-likely used for optimization.  We've found more than our fair share of invisible walls that stick too far out from modeled objects, and from time to time get caught up on weird geometry when trying to navigate tighter areas.  Along those same lines, level draw distance is pretty impressive, but characters and monsters often pop in without notice and with no fade in or general pattern of what calls when, it can be a bit odd.  You'll see one person obviously having a conversation, and then see the person he's talking to pop in a few seconds later.  This of course isn't a deal-breaker by any means, but it is a little weird to see.   Along those same lines much of the dual-screen aspects of the game aren't too impressive.  With the 3D action taking the top screen entirely, the bottom screen is used for some simple touch-based map controls and in-battle command menus.  Touch buttons in the game are generally small, though, so we suggest using classic controls rather than stylus, though it is an option.  In general the interface is also very simplistic, as the game's text and window presentation, but again these are hardly make-or-break aspects of a very impressive game.  More than anything this looks to us like a Monsters-based runthrough of the DQIX engine.  It's a blast to play, it's certainly a worthy successor to the DQM franchise, but it looks to be a stepping stone for Square Enix's true DQ adventure on DS.    Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker may not be a mind-blowing, innovative experience on DS, but it carries on the DQM lineage just the same.  Combining some impressive 3D work on the DS with over 200 collectable monsters, a lack of the somewhat irritating random dungeon generator, far more depth and production value overall, and impressive depth in a monster battler, Joker is a great chance for the more niche RPG gamers on DS to dive into the Monsters series for the first time and see for themselves what all the fuss is about.  Its far from perfect though, as the game is essentially more of the same for the series, and ends up cutting a few corners to squeeze it all in, specifically when looking at monster diversity (change the color palate, give it a new name), a somewhat basic interface, and some technical limits in 3D draw distance and world geometry.  Those expecting a product with the overall polish, scope, and grandeur of the Pokemon series may be let down. That being said, DQM is easily worth the cash for monster battlers that are looking for a new game to latch onto after Nintendos first party effort grows stale, as its more ambitious technically, has a stronger battle mechanic, and brings monster battle customization to whole new level on DS.", "date": "Nov 6, 2007"}
