Titles like Karaoke Revolution Party, DDR Ultramix 3, and Guitar Hero did almost everything right to give the dancing queens and living room rock stars everything they've been yearning for in a peripheral enhanced package and as these offerings gain in popularity its no surprise that copycats are showing up to the party. Enter Flow: Urban Dance Uprising, a version of DDR that exchanges J-Pop for Hip Hop and adds little else to the formula. We've never been quick to complain about too much of a good thing, but in this case things feel a little too familiar.    I'll provide a short informational review for those of you who've never graced a dance pad. Dance Dance Revolution originally appeared in the arcade as giant sized cabinet with a touch sensitive platform that let players hit directional buttons with their feet. With the volume cranked, it's difficult to think of an arcade game that creates more of a party atmosphere in what can be a very antisocial environment. The only major problem with DDR is that playing it in public can be intimidating for those of us who haven't been practicing for half of our lives. Shy-guys who still want to get their collective grooves on were blessed with a console version of the game back on PS1 and have since been treated to a huge number of sequels, remixes, and ultra-mixes.   Flow functions exactly like the games it was based on. Players hit a series of arrows in rhythm with the music to score points either against the computer or another player. Unlike Red Octane's In the Groove this game uses the same dance pad as DDR and will feel extremely familiar to any DDR veteran. There are a few additions worth mentioning although nothing that will drastically influence the genre as a whole.    For one, there are some slightly different visual cues. When players have to hit two arrows at the same time the icons are linked by a chain. This makes these difficult maneuvers more visible when they scroll towards the top of the screen. Players have the opportunity to ramp up the difficulty during a song by hitting Outside the Rhythm Arrows. These little suckers are great for extra points but don't necessarily ~flow~ with the song. There is also a Power Move mode that is initiated by hitting a lightning bolt icon. This makes the patterns more difficult but give players the chance to increase their overall score.     Flow's distinguishing characteristic is the style of music that pumps during the dance challenges. The soundtrack is one hundred percent Hip-Hop but hardly more recognizable than the majority of the electronic pop found in DDR games. The game includes a mix of indie, old-school, and unheard of artists but regardless of popularity, a majority of the tracks are enjoyable and provide the necessary beats for killing it on the dance floor. Unfortunately while the game makes a number of break dancing references it never encourages more than the typical fancy footwork. I was hoping that the game would suggest hitting the matt with hands, elbows, or even your head, but the challenges are pretty standard. You can always crank up the difficulty and invent your own challenges but that's about it for pop-lockin' and power moves.     Another where Flow shows untapped potential is the Eye Toy functionality. Players can use this peripheral to put themselves on screen behind the scrolling dance arrows. It's a shame that the camera isn't used to make players use their arms as well as their legs during the challenges. Flow would completely set itself apart from DDR with the addition of challenges players to touch objects around their bodies as a bonus. I can even imagine a scenario where players can ~serve~ each other by pulling off foot and hand combos. The possibilities are endless.    The visuals in dancing games have always been somewhat of a moot point. If you can see the arrows and there's a decent selection of characters then who cares what else is on the screen? Flow adds some flair with break dancing characters that battle and add more emotion to the versus mode. I only wish the game forced players to attempt some of the moves these onscreen characters pull off.While multiplayer mode and the workout options are nice inclusions, Flow doesnt offer anything beyond what youll find in the latest installment of DDR. Hardcore dancers will want to check out In The Groove, but if you already own a dance pad chances are youve already experienced everything Flow has to offer.", "date": "Dec 9, 2005"}
