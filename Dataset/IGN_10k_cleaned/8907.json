What, no? Oh, so the second banana guys from that painful sketch comedy series probably aren't familiar faces. Nickelodeon loves to reuse their pod children actors, so Drake and Josh got their own show, aptly (if not very originally) named Drake & Josh. They've been going strong for a few years, so it's high time the boys over at A2M made a game for them. Drake & Josh: Talent Showdown takes everything that made the show popular and throws it out the window. It instead replaces it with a bland waste of time that barely resembles the show it's based on.    For the majority of people over 15 that don't know who these schmucks are, here's the backstory. The premise of the show is simple enough. Drake and Josh are step brothers that have very little in common and now have to live with each other after their parents get married. It's like one-third of Step by Step (oh man, now there's a show worth remembering!). For the game, Drake and Josh are trying to enter the Teen American Talent competition, but their efforts are constantly road blocked by Travis and his jock friends. Putting aside their differences, Drake and Josh team up to trespass, sweet talk, and even fight their way to the competition, and hopefully stardom.    Right off the bat the game suffers from what many license titles do; it doesn't respect the source material. Okay, so it's a Nickelodeon sitcom aimed at pre-teens, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't actually resemble the source material. The character designs for the stars are crude and incongruent with the feel of the show. They don't even look much like Drake or Josh. All the other characters are weird androgynous teenagers that appear far too often and never get names. Players are constantly talking to some guy/girl in a purple shirt. It doesn't seem like it would have been hard to add even a couple more faces to the lineup.   All the whiney teenage action of Drake AND Josh! Since the game is played with a top-down camera view, faces are something players rarely see anyway. Only when Drake or Josh talks to a character and one of the drawings pop up on the top screen. The character models are pretty bland, and there aren't very many of them. Generic jocks fill the halls. Other characters, like the judges, are all the same guy with a different name five times. Drake and Josh are completely bland. Even the music is boring and repetitive, which is a real problem since a good portion of the title is a guitar playing minigame. Drake and Josh don't even do any voice acting for the game, nor are any screenshots or other actual likenesses used. They don't even look happy on the cover of the case, which is just a publicity shot from the show anyway.    The visual and auditory monotony is nothing compared to the tedium of the gameplay, though. Drake and Josh is one simple fetch quest, repeated dozens of times. Players guide the boys through a hallway, dodging or fighting jocks, then find a key and open a door. It takes about two minutes on average. Then players have to do it again, and again and again. It gets old well before the first level is over. It's not like the fetch quests are difficult, since Josh has a compass that always shows exactly where to go. Skill is never an issue in the game, so even the youngest of players is going to get bored from the lack of challenge. That's part of the problem too. Drake and Josh isn't a show for six-year-olds, and yet A2M has developed a game that is even simpler than some of their titles that are for that age bracket. Suite Life of Zack and Cody is harder than this game, and that doesn't make sense.    In between the levels are some guitar based minigames. Besides the music being less rocking than even the sappiest Death Cab for Cutie song, the presentation has some potential. Six strings stretch across the bottom screens and players have to tap or strum the notes as they scroll by, making sure to press the displayed button on the d-pad. It's a nice idea, but doesn't offer a lot of gameplay due to the simple style and lackluster songs. In addition to the music minigames, Josh can perform magic tricks using the DS touch screen. It's a matter of simply tracing a line with the stylus. Both games can be played outside of story mode, so players that are itching to trace lines dozens of times can finally get their fix! Why do the license games have to suck? Right the studios are putting pressure on the developers to make a game as quickly and cheaply as possible because they know that dumb kids and parents will buy anything with the brand name stamped on it. But besides that! Can't it be a rule that developers have to know something about the show before they make a whole game? That way half-baked, monotonous titles that do nothing for fans, like Drake and Josh won't keep getting made. Just stay away from this no talent title.", "date": "Aug 15, 2007"}
