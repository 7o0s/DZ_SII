I mean, there's nothing better than ancient landmarks, classical music or old-school baseball. Outdated videogames are another story. Sure, I appreciate my share of classics, whether it's Q-Bert, Spy Hunter or Kung Fu, but I haven't unearthed my Atari or 8-bit NES in some time to revel in the realm of forgotten lore. What if the glories of yesteryear returned to the PS? What would you do?Last August, Activision acquired the rights to Taito's best-selling hit Space Invaders. While bringing the game to multiple platforms, I was worried that Activision would dilute the original gameplay, translating it from 2D to 3D. Fortunately for traditionalists, there aren't any far-fetched gimmicks here. The PS version of Invaders is similar to the original coin-op, but with improved graphics and a smarter alien AI.Now, put yourself in my shoes. How can anyone review this game fairly? On one hand, we want to be mesmerized by stunning visuals, rich sounds and involved storyboards. We rarely settle for anything less. Sequels today must be better than its predecessor to be considered successful. On the other hand, how can you knock any game for maintaining its integrity, especially when the franchise succeeded for so many years. The developers have not raped this Space Invaders title. They've only revived it for a whole new generation.GameplayThink of what attracted you to Space Invaders in the past? It certainly wasn't killer graphics or sound effects. Gameplay has been and always will be its selling point. Even with a simple plot and ridiculously repetitive stages, it was addictive -- a narcotic, more appropriately, that kept us up for hours and ate tons of our hard-earned quarters. The objective: wipe out waves of aliens from your land-based vehicle, armed only with a laser cannon, while dodging enemy fire in coordinated attack formations. Simple in theory, yet so freakin difficult to accomplish.Twenty years later, the goal remains the same. The mission begins on Pluto and if you're lucky enough to survive the onslaught, you'll end up on Earth. In between, you'll encounter a slew of enemies, much smarter than before. Thirteen different alien species round out the roster, from your basic blue or yellow bugs to your more complex Blockers, Shifters, Kamikazes and Splitters. Don't expect them to quiver and die either. Some avoid your fire, some move out of their coordinated positions, and others try to damage your tank after being shot down. If that's not enough, you get to face a boss before moving on to another planet.Personally, I've always been ~Invader-challenged.~ The original Space Invaders was not my forte, and I couldn't stand losing to a bunch of moving targets. Well, my frustrations have carried over to this version. Beating the first boss on Pluto requires a lot of time, practice and patience. Unfortunately, I ran out of the latter too quickly. My only advice is to know thy enemy. Make sure you sacrifice yourself a few times to recognize the Crusher's patterns. Try to save your special weapon as well. It might come in handy when the boss bum rushes you from the side.That brings us to our next topic  weapons. On the upper right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the Heads Up Display, which indicates the overall score and your remaining lives. The power-up energy bar is also found on the HUD. How is any of this relevant? After shooting four aliens of the same color, the energy bar flashes and glows. At this point, you're awarded a power-up, which can be used by pressing the triangle button. In other words, destroy four of a kind and get some more juice. Red aliens, for instance, provide a vertical blast missile, annihilating anything in the vertical direction. Blocker aliens give you the appropriately titled fat laser, a two column-wide laser beam that rips through the opposition. And really, how can anyone resist mentioning a ~fat~ laser?Graphics & SoundThis is where my job gets a little tricky. Both the graphics and sound in the PS version of Space Invaders are better than the original 1978 coin-op. That's a no-brainer. However, compared to current space shoot-em-ups, this one's light years behind. Then again, I can't condemn Activision for staying as close to the original as possible. I'm sure they could have created a 3D environment filled with rich audio, a la modern versions of Pac-Man and Frogger, but what good would that do? This game doesn't have a strong plot anyway, so sacrificing gameplay for the sake of graphics, special effects and sounds seems ludicrous.The opening video montage is a definite bright spot. It shows you sitting inside your new hover tank, waiting for a practice run. As you pass by the army base, you see a sequestered junkyard, full of older, damaged tanks. Yup, the same vehicles that kicked alien butt 20 years ago, including the famous ~retired~ tank that eventually won the war. After a brief moment of reflection, the silence is broken by invading alien forces, and the game begins. It's easily my favorite scene in Space Invaders PS, bringing back lots of memories. Sniffle, sniff.This intro is the only feature carrying Activision's own stamp. All other aspects of this game are traditional, perhaps the way Taito wanted Space Invaders to be remembered. The sound suffers from the same dilemma of ~do we tweak it or leave it alone?~ In the end, developers made the right choice by maintaining and even enhancing Invaders' addictive gameplay. There's no point in worrying too much about presentation.I was skeptical. I'll be honest. There was no way Space Invaders 1999 could hold the jock strap of the original arcade and Atari versions. I kept repeating that statement to myself over and over, failing to realize how long I had been sitting in front of the TV. Four consecutive hours later, I had to change my tune. The franchise still has its grasp tightly around my neck. It offers something so simple, yet so entertaining and frustrating, all at the same time. I don't want to save the planet. In fact, I could care less. I just want to hone my shooting skills. I don't even have a good grasp of the plot. I mean, is there an army base on Pluto? If so, why are we there? Those are all moot points though. What matters is how much fun you can have playing this classic. I believe basic improvements, such as a smarter AI and a wider range of villains, are appropriate for the title. You must change with the times, while maintaining the game's integrity and playability. Go out and rent it if you can. Give it a good look, and if you're like most people who've played the original Space Invaders, you'll be hooked for hours.", "date": "Oct 22, 1999"}
