Earlier this week, I discussed how tricky it can be to bring an established console property to mobile, as you have to contend with consumer expectations and unscalable game mechanics. The secret to success is to deliver the proper essence of the traditional vid while accurately recreating the universe the game exists in. On these counts, SWAT Force succeeds.   Based on the SWAT PC franchise, which is enjoying a healthy new run thanks to a superlative PC entry last year, SWAT Force manages to faithfully deliver the essence of tactical police action to mobile. You control a two-man SWAT team consisting of a shooter and an explosives expert. Each member of the team has a few unique skills that come to bear during game play. The shooter, armed with rifles, can force criminals into submission and use flash bangs to disorient the bad guys. The explosives expert can diffuse bombs and traps, as well as arrest criminals. What's nice is that neither of these officers have excessive talents to keep track of (always good for mobile) nor that they compliment each other perfectly.   The action unfolds across seven situations that include bomb threats, hostage crises, and basic robberies. Many of these missions require you make criminals submit for arrest. You will certainly do some shooting, but I appreciated that the game actually focused on how police would mostly rather make arrests than fill body bags. There is a meter that tracks criminal awareness. The more you shoot, the more the criminals are keen to your arrival. This prevents you from always going in with guns blazing. The fact that bombs and traps are also hidden around each level also keeps this from degenerating into a simple run-and-gun affair. You must also keep both officers alive to succeed during each crisis situation. If one falls, you must restart.   My main complaint about SWAT Force? It's over too soon. Even though some of the missions can be tough to complete, the game still winds down after a little over an hour of play. Granted, I didn't play it all in one sitting -- but if you did have a spare couple hours at an airport and plenty of battery, you might find yourself downloading another game to fill the time.   SWAT Force looks good for a PC-to-mobile port. The officer sprites are good sized and feature some nice detail and animations. The levels are also solidly detailed. The game doesn't look all cartoon-y, too, which I found somewhat refreshing -- even though I have no beef against googly eyes and day-glo graphics.  SWAT Force is one of the better PC-to-mobile games I have played. The game delivers the tactical mechanics of the PC game, but scales back on the number of talents, tools, and objectives without sacrificing the general essence of the series. I think fans of the franchise should give this game a look, as well as any mobile gamers that might be a bit puzzle game'd out for the moment.", "date": "Apr 1, 2006"}
