The next one is The Sims 2: Seasons, which should ship to stores today.   Until now, we've only had two core Sims games on the PC: The Sims and The Sims 2. The Sims: Life Stories is a new, stand-alone game, and brand, that does not interact in any way with either of the other core games. The question, of course, is whether you need this one if you've got the others?   Life Stories is billed as ~PC Laptop Friendly~ on the front cover of the case. Indeed, The Sims has historically been one of the worst resource hogs outside of first-person shooters, especially when you throw in all the aforementioned expansion packs. The idea here is that Life Stories can be played on laptops and under-the-gaming-curve PCs, which ordinarily would be unable to handle the game.    Largely, this is true. We tried the game on a couple low-caliber machines, one laptop and one desktop, that barely met the minimum requirements. Even with full graphics options enabled, the game ran well, with only a few hitches here and there when many Sims were on the screen at once. This still holds even if you want to run the game in windowed mode (which is actually the default), allowing you to play the game while doing anything else on your computer, such as using instant messaging programs or writing something in MS Word (not that we'd ever encourage blowing off homework or office work for a game, of course).   Life Stories was built on the Sims 2 engine, which means a major performance boost is no small feat. Every object and character in the game is three-dimensional, unlike The Sims 1, where only the Sims themselves were three-dimensional (everything else was a two-dimensional sprite). Lighting has color to it, and emanates from the sources they should; that is, lamps seem to give off light, rather than rooms being magically bright just because a lamp object is there. Mirrors can reflect what's actually in the room, and shadows are more than serviceable. Free Will, the option that turns on artificial intelligence for your own Sims, actually seems improved over the core game. Yet, no slow down.    Gameplay wise, this the same Sims 2 you know and love. You'll control your Sims' every action, from washing dishes and watching TV to going to work and going to the toilet when appropriate. Adult Sims can have kids, and all Sims age, grow, and eventually die. You can trigger all sorts of nasty things to them in the process, with fires and the like, if your tendencies are more destructive than constructive. There is an array of objects and decorations to buy, and you can build your Sims' houses with a variety of wallpaper and carpet options. In this, nothing has changed between Life Stories and the core titles.   So far, so good. Once you get into the game itself and explore its depths, however, you'll notice the price paid for the performance boost. You can only have the default ~Four Corners~ neighborhood, whereas in The Sims 2, you can have literally infinite neighborhoods. The Four Corners neighborhood is quite a bit smaller than anything in The Sims 2, and the house lots are significantly smaller as well. (The largest Life Stories lot is roughly one-fourth the size of the largest Sims 2 lot.) You also only have a maximum of four family members, which is half the cap in Sims 2.    Options in Buy Mode and Build Mode are also limited. There is a selection of beds, tables, chairs, and so on that you can buy, but you'll run through them pretty quickly. It's tougher to make distinctive styles, and nearly impossible to open community lots (shops and parks) that have any variety in them whatsoever.   Life Stories derives its name from the fact that it features a mode similar to the console versions of The Sims. There are two ~Life Stories,~ where you'll be in control of a single Sim and guide him or her through their time in Four Corners. Their stories are pulled right out of a typical afternoon soap opera; whether that's good or bad is up to you, but both have their share of plot twists and humor.    These stories function as extended tutorials, teaching you how to play by giving you simple goals. For example, as you control Riley in the first life story, you'll start by being told to get a job and start dating some of the guys around town. Eventually, you'll find that one of the guys has an ulterior motive; this leads to heartbreak and reconciliation, and eventually a husband with whom a child is brought into the Sim world. Along the way, the game will be there to advise you on how to complete goals; i.e., it will tell you to raise the relationship meter if you want to be able to successfully give a kiss to someone.   The stories are all right and function correctly. However, while they prove to be a nice distraction (and will take you the better part of a weekend to finish), there's just something intangible missing from the fact that you aren't making your own stories with your own characters. This means the Freeform play is definitely the main draw, but again, with the limited family and house sizes, it feels lacking.   The sounds of the game, from the trademark ~Simlish~ voices of the characters to the music on the radio, is the same as you've heard all along. If you have some MP3s on you computer, you can have the game play those instead. While the sounds are sufficient, you'll be wanting your own collection pretty quickly.    All in all, while Life Stories does indeed give that performance boost and makes the game playable on low-end machines, what it loses in the process is just too much. We concede that, perhaps, the problem lies in the fact that weve played obscene numbers of hours in The Sims 1 and The Sims 2 with all their expansion packs. Playing Life Stories just seems like a step backwards.Life Stories is really made only for a very select group of people: those with PCs or laptops who want to play The Sims, but are unable to due to the minimum requirements. If you have a PC capable of running The Sims 2 and its expansion packs, get that instead. Though you give up the goal-based story mode, what you gain is much, much greater. Hopefully, EA will eventually put the story mode in an expansion pack to The Sims 2, giving PC users with powerful machines the best of both worlds.", "date": "Mar 1, 2007"}
