{"name": "Mayday: Conflict Earth", "name_review": "Mayday", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/02/17/mayday", "text": "Warning: Mayday was released in Europe in 1998 under the exact same name and in the exact same condition it was released in the U.S. a few weeks ago. For all intents and purposes this game is almost three years old. Mayday is dated and it shows.  In 2051, the Earth's environmental resources have been depleted and catastrophic natural disasters are rampant.  Instead of uniting as a human race, the world breaks into three separate factions to claim global supremacy and basically kick-start World War III. The three factions formed are the technologically efficient UCA (United Continents of America), the research handy ASF (Asian Federation), and the lascivious, smugglers of the SBL (Southern Block). Europe somehow escapes becoming involved in the conflict other than as researchers and agents of espionage for the factions. Go figure.  Anyone who has played an isometric, 2D real-time strategy game like Red Alert 2 or Starcraft should be able to jump right into Mayday. After being given a mission goal, you explore a map filled with black fog, and eventually destroy everything in sight. You build, research, and build some more until your army is unstoppable. It's not brain surgery and it's about as original as scrambled eggs, but for some reason these games keep getting made.     Though Mayday appears to be your typical Command and Conquer clone, it actually tries a few interesting things.  First of all, there is no resource harvesting or structure building in Mayday. All of the buildings you possess either need to be assigned or found in the field. On the one hand, this helps you focus on the strategy of defense and offense instead of trying to remember what buildings you have to manufacture to bump to the next point on your technology tree. On the other hand, you'll hate it if you're only assigned one infantry plant in the beginning of the game. You've got to run around the map, trying to find an enemy vehicle plant to take over before you can even hope to hit the helicopters that have been slaughtering your men for the past twenty-minutes.   And the lack of a mineral/plant/animal to harvest for money may seem a godsend at first, but the two bucks Mayday gives you every second take a long time to add up.  Even though you get a certain amount of money each time you conquer an enemy building or recycle a charred vehicle, a Counter-Strike ~destroy-and-get-paid~ system would have been a welcome alternative to watching your budget slowly creep up over time.  The graphics of Mayday are severely out dated. The game looks best in 1024 x 768 resolution, though unless you have a 21~ monitor your units will be too tiny to navigate comfortably. Some of the buildings and units are directly lifted from old school RTS games and even look suspect in the battlefield view. And though the game totes the use of varied droids (instead of humans) as soldiers, you really can't tell the difference between any of the infantry units.  The multiplayer component of Mayday is seriously lacking as well. Because any infantry unit can invade an enemy structure and convert it, the game just becomes a rehash of the frustrating engineer-wars from C&C. Add to this the fact that there is no online component and only a max of four people on a LAN line, and you'll be screaming for Red Alert 2 or Shogun in no time    Mayday does, however, do a good job of implementing a 3D level and slope design that works nicely in creating different layers on the battlefield. The higher level ground your units reach, the farther they can see and fire their weapons. This feature leads to some tense situations where your units race the enemy to take the high ground. These moments are few and far between, however, as most of the maps are flat as a day old Dr. Pepper.  Though it's often hard to understand what the obviously European actors are trying to say in the FMV sequences, they add an international flavor to the game that meshes nicely with the World War III theme. The techno-pop soundtrack is invigorating without bordering on annoying. The droid infantry units respond to clicking with somewhat charming robo-attitude such as ~I need some oil!~ and the ever illustrious ~Bend Over!~   If Mayday sounds like an okay game so far, let me hit you with the clincher: the AI and unit selection is atrocious to point of being unforgivable. You'll be clicking for days to select your units. On numerous occasions, you can't even select certain vehicles. You have to leave the straggler in the dust and send your forces forward to attack. Imagine the frustration in finding you can't even select the enemy units you're attacking! And even though the unit AI should automatically attack the enemy, it doesn't. As enemy units approach, your forces will freeze in indecision and bite it in a matter of seconds. Perhaps the droids are evolving into pacifists, but I doubt it.  -- Scott Humphries      Want to share your opinions with the world?
