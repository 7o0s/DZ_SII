Since we first saw the game back at 1998's Tokyo Game Show the standard set of four arrows hasn't budged. That's more than nine years of playing what is essentially the very same game. Sure, there are new modes and songs to be found within each (or at least most) of the new renditions, but when you get down to the basics of DDR you realize that things have been the same for far too long.    Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2 comes packed to the gills with every type of mode that a DDR fanatic could ever want from a dance game but that doesn't necessarily mean that we're happy with its total lack of progression.   Complete insanity.  Because this form of ~dance revolution~ has been around for so long, the gameplay in this newest edition is relatively inaccessible for newcomers, something that has been a sort of pitfall in these last two DDR titles. While there is the Basic Edition that teaches you the fundamentals of playing, the difficulty gradient gets steep in a hurry once you enter Master Edition with some songs being too difficult even on the easy setting. Tone it down to beginner and you feel like you belong on the short bus, but leave it on basic and frustration will quickly set in. There's no real sweet spot to be found.   If you do possess the fine-tuned command of your bottom half, then there actually is a solid offering of game modes within the Master Edition. You'll find the always popular Party Mode and its assortment of options. It brings the standard endurance songs that sound all too similar to what we saw from the first Universe game. There's Game Mode which is nothing more than the standard arcade mode that we all know and love, minus the quarter of course. Challenge Mode will keep some busy for awhile, but its length is largely determined by your skill or lack thereof. Some will be able to make it to the upper-echelon, and that's where the real fun lies, but most will likely be confined to the easier set of challenges. Thankfully there's more to it than clearing songs (you'll have to link jump moves together or avoid getting ~bad~ on a single beat) but that doesn't stop the challenges from feeling hackneyed.   The Quest Mode is DDR's attempt at giving player's a true videogame experience but it falls apart at the seams. First of all there's no over-arching story. While that may seem like an unrealistic demand for Dance Dance Revolution it feels as though the creators were heading in that direction but never quite got there. There are characters in the world with distinct personalities but you never get to know them beyond their avatar saying, ~You're worth paying to see!~ or something negative if you fail. You get challenges from different clubs around your area and there is the overall goal of having to build up money, but for what main purpose? Why am I doing this beyond being able to buy new garments (which do absolutely nothing) for my created character? You never get the feeling that your avatar inhabits a fully realized DDR Universe, even though the name of the game would suggest otherwise. Thus the Quest Mode never feels like anything more than an ill-conceived distraction (complete with horrific map navigation).   Don't stop a-rockin'.  Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2 also touts itself as being the first DDR on Xbox 360 to include the Freestyle Mode, but none can be found on the main menu. To access the new addition you'll need to click on Party Mode then scroll through a few of the options and select Free. Once we did locate the mode it became clear why it's hidden. While toddlers will have fun slamming on the pad any way that they'd like, rest assured that there's nothing more to be found.   If there's one saving grace of DDR Universe 2 it's the online play. The attack mode is as fun as ever though that hinges on whether you can find an opponent. It took us upwards of a half an hour to find any sort of match. Thankfully our online experience performed well without any signs of lag. Since online play is reasonably new for the series it was still able to hold our attention for a little while, but not long enough to warrant a purchase.   The list of songs boasts that it fits all eras and spans from the '70s, '80s, '90s and all the way up through present day but chances are American dance freaks won't know a single track beyond the ones mentioned on the back of the box. Universe 2 also alienates its J-Pop roots a bit more than some will like and instead goes with a more European flavor. The tracks obviously play the same as they did previously, but DDR vets might be disappointed with some of the choices.  The stake through the heart of Dance Dance Revolution Universe 2 is its refusal to adapt new gameplay mechanics or inventive modes. Weve been playing the same DDR for the last ten years and its high time that gamers stood up and demanded an overhaul of the formula. Its ludicrous for people to continue to pay full price when all theyre really getting is an updated song list. Two games; sure, three games; fine, but nearly ten years of the same game has got to be stopped.", "date": "Dec 18, 2007"}
