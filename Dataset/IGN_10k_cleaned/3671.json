Aside from people who had never played games before getting into titles such as Driver and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, SCEA saw fit to dive into the kids market, and with the help of THQ and a number of other publishers, they grabbed a healthy portion of the under 10 market and stayed there.   For the most part, SCEA made the gaming market a better one. But when it came to kids games, the definition of a kids game, once defined by Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers and Capcom's Ghosts and Goblins -- which were challenging games -- was redefined. They weren't easy by any means. But games such as Rugrats and the like were. These kids game were incredibly easy, casually designed games that didn't offer clever game elements, secret challenges or intelligent replay aspects. They were dumbed-down versions of their ancestors, offering copycat designs, limp graphics and were more part of a marketing campaign than an actual game project.    Finding Nemo doesn't entirely break the mold, but it's intelligent, good-looking, and challenging, giving players a near-perfect blend of movie cutscenes and swimmingly good gameplay to tie it all up in a lovely little bow. I had to replay a few levels to get them right, and I did a double take. I thought I would easily breeze through this game. Luckily, it's simply but not entirely easy. Also, I enjoyed the characters, several of the level designs and the puzzles brought it all home.   Gameplay  Based on the Pixar Studios movie of the same name, Finding Nemo takes the library of tried-and-true platform elements and descends underwater. If you were a pudgy little plumber on land in the standard platformer, in Travellers' Tales Finding Nemo, you are a squirrelly little Clown Fish trying to navigate the enormity of the world's oceans in search for your lost son, Nemo.   Using a combination of 2D and 2D style techniques, players get the chance to play as little Nemo, his father Marlin, and a friendly, memory-free friendly fish by the name of Dory who helps you out along the way. If you have played the movie-licensed game Tarzan or any of the Crash Bandicoot games, you will instantly feel comfortable playing this. The early levels are filled with training missions that smoothly transition to standard non-training missions without a hitch. Speaking of hitch-less gameplay, aside from some moderate load times (15-30 seconds on PS2), the transition from game to movie is technically fluid, while there are almost no visual differences between the two at all. The result is an unending string of events blending happily from game to movie and back again, creating a believable underwater world.    Head-to-Head Available!

Read It Now | Having played far too many THQ kids games, this one comes with a happy little star(fish) by its side. While the game presents players with familiar platform concepts, the hitch is that it's all done in the guise of a fish, which alters the course a bit and provides Travellers' Tales with a slightly different pallet of tools to with which to work. If you like the movie and have a kid, this is an entirely recommended game to play. It's colorful and good looking, provides a good healthy level of anti-stupid puzzles and gameplay techniques and it's funny and enjoyable to boot. Not a brilliant game but a nonetheless good, solid one.", "date": "May 28, 2003"}
