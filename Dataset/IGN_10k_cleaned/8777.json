Among the first is Golden Axe, SEGA's popular arcade beat-em-up that offers a slower, more strategic pace compared to most side-scrolling brawlers. Other than a few shortcomings that have been present in the game's code since its original release in 1989, Golden Axe manages to maintain its longevity and should be a presence felt on all Xbox 360 hard drives.   Golden Axe tells the tale of three heroes struggling against Death Adder, who is--judging only by name, here--one big, evil guy. The three selectable characters contain one obvious contrast, that being their magical proficiency: the dwarf's maximum magic level is very small, the barbarian is somewhat skilled, and the Amazon has the greatest ability. Otherwise, the characters are pretty equal in terms of damage dealing and how much abuse each is able to survive.   Like most side-scrolling beat-em-ups, Golden Axe's greatest boon is its multiplayer mode. Available over Xbox Live or on a single Xbox 360, players can team up to combat Death Adder's forces as a team. Dampening the experience ever so slightly is the lack of a Friendly Fire option, overtly absent over the game's other customization options such as choosing the size of each player's health bar and how many lives each may have. The possibility of harming a player's buddy adds some strategy to the game, as players will have to use more communication than in most beat-em-ups to ensure that each stays out of the other's way. While it might be part of the original design, an option with which to turn Friendly Fire on and off would have been appreciated. It's still annoying to end up knocking your comrade off a cliff instead of an intended enemy, or to mistakenly lob a fiery projectile into a friend instead of a boss.    Though some have always questioned Golden Axe's decision to only allow two-player simultaneous play when there are three protagonists available, the game's pace renders this decision an appropriate one. Slower in terms of pace than other arcade titles such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Golden Axe chooses to place a smaller amount of powerful enemies onscreen, rather than crowding the playing field with hundreds of weaker foes. Allowing three players would almost assuredly have caused the game to be too easy to complete; as it stands, the adventure is plenty challenging with two players, let alone a brave soul who decides to solo-play the adventure.   Another gripe is Golden Axe's magic system. Players collect magical pots by way of kicking squirrel-like NPCs in the face and subsequently picking up the magic they drop. Each pot contributes to the overall power of the player's magical attack. Instead of implementing a system whereby players can ration out the magic by holding a button to choose the level of magic they wish to invoke--such a system exists in Golden Axe II--players are forced to use all of their magic at once. This means that teaming up with some individuals who don't know when best to use their magic can make some Xbox Live expeditions harder than necessary; some players can also be rather greedy when it comes to sharing dropped magic pots. Don't bogart the pot, we say.   Golden Axe holds its own as one of Xbox Live Arcade's prettier titles. While not of the caliber of last month's Prince of Persia Classic, the smoother graphics--an option selectable in the game's settings menu--gives the game a slightly prettier, more modern face than its jaggy original look. The game's soundtrack still holds up flawlessly, with musical cues such as a change in tone before a boss fight--usually in tandem with the sun setting, which was always a cool flare enjoyed by many in the arcades of old--adding quite a bit to the feel of the game. Some of the sound effects, particularly death screeches, are grating, though mercifully not drawn out.  The first legendary adventure of Gilius Thunderhead, Ax Battler, and Tyris Flare is one that is still fun today. Co-op play over Xbox Live greatly extends the game's lifeline, and its emphasis on using a degree of strategy and communication over much more frantic titles such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles provides a nice change of pace. Its charm will probably wear off after two or three times. You could venture onto another console and purchase a SEGA Genesis collection for a much better deal, but this is really your only option to play Golden Axe on Xbox 360. And for that, 400 Microsoft Points (US$5) is not a bad deal.", "date": "Jul 17, 2007"}
