That is, if you can get through the cheesy full-motion video mission briefings (yes, you're um, ~treated~ to real actors delivering objectives before each of the nine campaigns). The most striking difference when compared to other games of the genre is the fully 3D graphics engine, and the move from turn-based gameplay like we saw in Jagged Alliance 2, to full real-time action. We'll take aim at these attributes in a few after we cover the essentials...   In Shadow Company, the gamer takes control of a group of highly-specialized mercenaries who were ~left for dead~ by their employers, the Granite Corporation, during a heated mission. Fortunately for you, another shady firm with deep pockets [no, not Microsoft] has taken interest in your elite force and asks for you to continue on with your mission. Before you know it, you're knee-deep in a huge global conspiracy. For each of the varied missions  such as infiltration, destroying key buildings or assassinating a potential threat to the ~cause~, to name a few  you must choose from a pool of sixteen unique mercenaries, each with varying skills. Make sure not to blow all your coin too fast on these mercenaries  proper equipment must be purchased for the job, too. And as a nice touch to the gameplay, your MERCs will gain experience over time. Another role-playing game addition is the inventory system - characters have limited space for weapons and supplies (health packs, wire cutters, ammo, etc.). When your troupe isn't sneaking around on the ground scouting some baddies or using a sniper and silencer to peg one of them off, they have access to vehicles needed later on in the game such as boats, Hummers, tanks and snowmobiles.   Gameplay is fairly rich, with nine campaigns housing many linear missions and some occasional plot turns, to boot. The selected group (up to eight per mission) is dropped at an predetermined way point and by using your map, tools, weapons and some tactical savoir-faire, the gang must either split up or work together to accomplish the goal, whether it's to scurry behind buildings and trees to ambush a group of soldiers or to steal a boat and sneak up to an ocean liner transporting tanks.   Graphically, the game is nothing short of striking. As with Bungie's revolutionary Myth series, the terrain is in true 3D, allowing the gamers to play with the controllable cameras to rotate around the environments or zoom in and out at will. The rolling terrain isn't just for good looks either  gameplay is affected by this modeling of real-world physics  MERCs travel fast when going downhill, enemies may be obstructed by objects and boats will cause ripples on water that vary in size depending on the speed of travel. In fact, a 4MB 3D accelerator card is required to the play the game, which may hurt sales some, but after the first look at Shadow Company's resolutions, that top 1600 x 1200 in 16- or 32-bit color, you'll know that it's worth the hardware to get the game running.   So, with good gameplay and incredible graphics, why the luke-warm score of 7.4? (C'mon, we know you read the score first from the main review page so who ya kiddin'?). For all it has going for it, Shadow Company suffers from some serious shortcomings that, depending on what kind of gamer you are, may frustrate you to the point of searching for the dreaded ~uninstall~ option.   First off, the enemy AI in the game is completely unrealistic. If there are two soldiers standing no more than three feet of each other and you take one out with a pistol, in most cases, the other just stands there as if nothing happened. The same thing goes for an enemy who walks into a pile of dead comrades. Gee, you'd think he would take cover by hiding in somewhere, but alas, chances are he will not stray from his patrol route. This also makes it pretty much useless to pick up a body and hide it somewhere else  a feature offered in the game  as the enemy AI rarely acts any different either way.  Second, there are some control and camera issues that should've been ironed out prior to release. While the mouse sensitivity can be tuned somewhat, it's annoyingly hard to maneuver the camera to view the action (while holding down the right-mouse button). It's not quite a Blair Witch cam, but it can get dizzyingly difficult to use this feature properly.   Finally, the game offers multiplayer support but it's cooperative only (Deathmatch, or rather, SneakMatch would've been great), it's quite laggy (even on a cable modem) and it's available only via a LAN (most gamers don't have one) or TCP/IP, so you must know the opponents IP address. Folks  this is late 1999  if we want to reduce the barriers of entry so that more people find it easier to play games, we have to include simple programs that list hosted servers that we can click on with the mouse instead of doing these back-flips just to start a multiplayer game. Learn from Diablo or Half-Life, please.  There are also a few other random anomalies in the game: clipping problems, getting stuck on an object, some vehicles are hard to control, and being forced to pixel-hunt in order to pick up inventory found on the ground, just to name a few.  As should be evident by this review, Shadow Company is a good game that could've been a great one. While it offers fresh real-time gameplay, jaw-dropping visuals and challenging missions, players will have to decide for themselves if its failings are annoying enough to ruin the overall experience. For me, it wound up being an experience that was sometimes tolerable, sometimes not, but overall surprisingly entertaining. The final call? Shadow Company is a solid  if unpolished  diversion for both strategy and action fans alike.   -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Nov 6, 1999"}
