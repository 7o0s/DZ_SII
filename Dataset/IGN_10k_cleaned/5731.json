Last weekend, Sony's ~xXx: State of the Union~ crashed into theaters with a wet thud, landing at third place -- but don't let the film's lackluster performance deter you from making this download if you like action gaming. xXx: State of the Union is an easy-breezy shooter complete with platforming elements and one-liners. It's not the deepest game you'll ever play, but it's good summer mobile gaming.   You are Darius Stone, a former Navy SEAL brought back into service as the new xXx because of your great skills. (Bow hunting skills, computer hacking skills...) Apparently, a senator is funding an arms smuggling ring on the black market in an effort to stage a coup on Capitol Hill. Your mission is to bring the arms dealers and the Senator down, which unfolds over five levels that range from a Cuban warehouse to NSA headquarters to the steps of Capitol Hill.   xXx: State of the Union is a total side-scroller, straight outta 1994. You will run from left to right a lot, shooting bad guys off perches and flipping switches. Mercifully, you have a little auto-aim feature that simplifies the action when a bad guy rushes on-screen. If you can shoot at the bad guy from your position -- no obstacles are between you and the enemy -- a green target will appear on the enemy. So, if you are on the floor and a bad guy stands on top of a pile of crates, the target will appear if you stand back far enough. Pressing the action button fires, and a few taps will bring the fella to his knees. On a console, this auto-fire feature would be irritating, but it works in xXx: State of the Union because it keeps the action moving briskly. You don't have to struggle with jumping around and squinting to line up perfect shots.   Darius does have a little back-up. Toby is back at NSA, helping Darius get through doors or hack computers. A good portion of the game is spent hitting the right switches to open doors, (de)activate machines, and start elevators. Because the individual scenes within each level are so manageable, these requirements don't feel like too much of a chore. Sure, we're all starting to get tired of matching key cards with doors, but at least there is no significant backtracking like you used to find in, say, a Resident Evil title.   Toby isn't you're only help. There is a lot of firepower in xXx: State of the Union, and no shortage of ammo. Darius will usually have a pistol, but eventually shotguns, AK47s (today was a good day...), rocket launchers, and plastic explosives come into the picture.   We tested xXx: State of the Union on an LG VX8000. The visuals were bright and crisp. While you couldn't see Darius' face -- no Cube for you! -- his little on-screen avatar did have some decent detail and animation. When an enemy is in range, Darius automatically brings up his gun and aims in the proper direction. Even better is when he pops a bad guy and a tiny one-liner appears over his head. These happen more than they probably should, but it's still good fun. As mentioned, xXx: State of the Union isn't exactly innovative gaming, but it's solid gaming -- and for a few bucks, you deserve nothing less. The auto-fire feature really helps smooth out the gameplay and keeps things moving at a reasonable clip. There is no shortage of bad guys to shoot, yet it never gets overwhelming. Good, breezy stuff that doesn't attempt to re-invent the wheel, but not every game has to.", "date": "May 3, 2005"}
