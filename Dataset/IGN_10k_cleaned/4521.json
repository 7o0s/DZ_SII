After moderate success as the console's first well-received platformer, Gex quickly made the jump to more powerful hardware including the likes of Sega's Saturn and Sony PlayStation. Last year Crystal Dynamics released Gex: Enter the Gecko for PlayStation and in doing so dragged the reptile kicking and screaming into the realm of 3D. Despite some poor camera issues, Gex ~3D~ remains one of the best platformers for PlayStation. Unfortunately, what would have been an average platformer by Nintendo 64 standards is turned into a sub-par frustration model thanks to a shoddily executed port.  ~It's tail time,~ proclaims Crystal Dynamics' trademark gecko upon booting Gex 64: Enter the Gecko. The above greeting transpires via an opening 3D animation in real-time. The reptile runs out onto a blank blue background, spits out his tongue in an impressive display of poor animation, moves his lips perfectly out of synch with the said speech and then flops off the screen revealing the game's opening title. The attention to detail and precision is nonexistent. This is only the beginning...  The Facts 24 movie and television theme levels. Full 3D control.  More than 125 moves including whip-crackling, tail attacks, tongue grabbing, flying karate kicks and climbing up walls. The voice of comedian Dana Gould as Gex.  Controller Pak required.   Gameplay Gex 64: Enter the Gecko strictly follows the platformer formula. Players explore 3D levels with full freedom of direction, collecting various items and thwarting enemies. Each level exhibits its own theme and design, thus affecting what the slippery gecko collects at any given time. For example, in one world very reminiscent of a Looney Tunes cartoon, Gex picks up carrots for extra men and hidden bonuses and must avoid enemies that look eerily similar to Elmer Fudd. In another level, the haunted mansion, the gecko collects tombstones and skulls to unlock hidden extras and must keep a lookout for walking zombies, ghosts and the likes. Additionally, Gex must accomplish specific pre-set objectives for each level. For example, in one level the sticky-tongued reptile might have to dispose of all the Elmer Fudd look-alikes to activate a remote, the gateway to new worlds. It all works very similar to Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, with the addition of Gex's clingy, suction-cup-like feet, which allow the gecko to walk on certain walls. This added option opens up a whole new level of playability and freedom, which we wish had been more thoroughly explored. As it stands, only select scenarios really put Gex's unique ability to the test, which is a shame because it's arguably the most fun aspect of the game. The wiry lizard can also snap his tail at enemies, use his tail as a spring to reach higher elevations, swim and jump. When compared to Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64 though, the game controls awkwardly, stiff, and can be downright frustrating at times.  Graphics Gex 64 is perfect example of a rushed port. The PlayStation version of the game, released more than a year ago, looks and runs much better. There's no fog in the PlayStation version. There's Turok-scale fog in Gex 64. There's hardly any slowdown in the PlayStation version. Gex 64, on the other hand, is constantly slowing down around corners, in new rooms, around specific enemies  all over the place. Not only that, but the Gex for PlayStation boasts more detail than Gex 64. C'mon, is this what more powerful hardware does to games? We don't think so.  Sound Dana Gould's stand-up comedy is often hilarious. That said, Dana Gould's one-liners throughout the Gex franchise are terrible and Gex 64 proves to be no exception. Really, are we supposed to laugh at ~Forget about it!~ and ~Has anyone seen Fox Mulder's sister?~ or ~Don't take career advice from Joe Piscopo.~ Not only are these comments thrown out in totally random order, they are often repeated 10 times during a level in the N64 version due to speech limitations. And if all of the above weren't bad enough, the game's music sometimes comes to a complete stop in mid-level and manages to take any ambience the world had with it.  Gex 64 isn't a terrible game, but it's definitely not in the same league as Nintendo 64's Banjo-Kazooie or Super Mario 64. In fact, Bomberman 64 is probably the better game. It's really a shame, too, because Gex for PlayStation was actually a commendable attempt at a 3D platformer that pushed the console's hardware. On the Nintendo 64 though, Gex has been watered down, fogged in and ultimately sloppily ported. This could have been a much better game. And given its competition, it should have been.", "date": "Sep 11, 1998"}
