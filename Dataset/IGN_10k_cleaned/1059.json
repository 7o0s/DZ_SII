Playing a computer simulation can never really give you the feeling of actually swinging the club, and sometimes (if not often) leaves much to be desired.  PGA Golf 2000 changes that.  Implementing crisp graphics, smooth animations, and a wonderful ~True Swing~ mode, your perception of golf games on the PC may change.   The option to have a ~quick start~ is a welcome feature to golf games, which can often be hard to get into.  For the more customizable fans out there, believe me, there is plenty to tweak.  First choose a golfer, from a long list of player models.  After that, you can choose from many different faces.  Now comes the best part...dressing him!  You can pick from all sorts of hats, hair types, shirts, pants, shoes, and trims.  Now that you have your styling golfer, head on over to the type of game you want to engage in.  You can start a season on either the pro or amateur circuit, where you can tour all the courses included with the game.  If you think that your long shot needs a little help, there is a wonderful driving range at your disposal.  You can also practice chipping and putting.   Or, just get into a quick game in normal play mode.  Within the normal play mode there are 12 different types including:  Medal, match, stableford, skins, best ryder ball cup, best ball greensome, best ball bloodsome, two player scramble, four player scramble, four ball medal, four ball match, four ball stableford.  Personally, my favorite was stableford.  Each shot is awarded a specific point value.  The object here is to obtain the highest score, deviating from traditional golf rules.  Making par will yield zero points, while one stroke under par will give you two points, two strokes under five points, and three stokes under a whopping eight points.  When you start shooting over par, penalties are given--negative one for one over par, and negative two for two over par.  This is especially interesting while playing on the Internet, because you can no longer rely on your opponent to do as poorly as you, if you make a mistake.  Now, any mistake made will result in points lost.  Along with these general game options, there are ~side games~.  Side games are small objectives that you can accomplish while abiding by your current game mode.    Also adjustable are weather conditions and green conditions.  The green can be made wet, moist, dry, very dry etc.  And the wind can be adjusted from still to strong, where they warn you to ~batten down the hatches.~  I prefer no wind at all, but that's just me.  The rough length can also be changed from short to long.  Onto the course!   Once in the game, you'll notice that the interface is still similar to most golf games (nothing terribly innovative) like distance, lie, wind speed, clubs etc.  For those of you that are familiar with the standard tri-click method of golfing, here is a chance to expand your horizons.  Implementing the ~True Swing~ feature that was used in PGA Golf '99, a much more realistic golf swing can be portrayed.  Simply click the mouse button, and then slide it back to gain power, and slide it forward for your shot.  Moving the mouse slightly to the left or right can determine whether you draw, hook, fade, or slice.  It even registers your tempo and pace, making your shot that much more realistic.  Also implemented is the new ~SmartSwing~ that learns how you as an individual, swing the club, and then adjusts itself to your style.  If you find that this is too much for you to handle, the standard tri-click method is still available for you to use...but it's not as fun!  One thing that I found most enlightening was the attention paid to detail for this feature.  If you move the mouse too far to the left, your golfer will lose his balance, and proceed to fall flat on his back.  If you move the mouse too far to the right, he will do a face plant, and become a little more acquainted with the grass.    One incredibly annoying issue is the commentary.  It is painfully obvious where parts of speech are cut off to blend with others.  They are nowhere near as smooth as games such as NHL 2000 and NBA Live 2000.  Once the commentator gives you his brief (and I mean really brief) description of the hole, you are free to take a swing.  However, once the ball is in mid-flight, the computer freezes for a second, so it can switch its view of the ball so it looks as if it is coming towards you. Even after painstakingly navigating the menus for over 10 minutes, I was unable to find a place where I could disable the camera feature.  Not only does this slow down gameplay, but the commentator tells you exactly what's going to happen as well:  ~Uh Oh, is this one going to catch the rough?~ and when he says that, you know that it will.  On a good note, there are plenty of different camera angles at your disposal, and you can have several different views open at once.    Some of the greatest things about PGA 2000 are its graphics and sound.  The music is quite relaxing, and each course carries its own theme.  The golfer sounds are satisfactory, but not enough is heard from the surroundings, like the crowd and ambient sounds.  As far as the visuals are concerned, the pre-rendered backgrounds are breathtaking, but are extremely ugly when you get up close.  My favorite parts about the graphical aspect of the game are the actual fairways and greens.  They are very detailed, and give you the impression that it is freshly cut grass. The ball physics, and overall feel of the game are excellent.    If it weren't for the confusing WON interface, connecting to a multiplayer game couldn't get any easier.  Once you master WON's confusing menus, you can hop right into a game online.  Normally online golf games are fairly slow.  Sometimes it's due to lag, but most of the time it's because it just takes so long for players to take their respective shots.  Now, PGA Golf boasts ~ReadyPlay,~ which enables you to play your ball independent from your opponents.  This yields faster, better, and more realistic gameplay.  For example, if I were to be taking my second shot, I might be able to see my opponent landing his ball on the green, all in real time.  This is a brilliant addition to the game, and makes multiplayer experiences that much more enjoyable.    If the courses that came with the game are starting to bore you (considering there are only 5 new ones, 8 are from last year), then head on over to the course architect, where you can unleash your creative side.  Included is a wizard that will aid you in your course design, but even with this it is still somewhat difficult to get a course built.  But who said level design was easy?  It pales in comparison to making a level for Unreal Tournament (trust me, I've tried).  However, it could still be easier than it is.  25 pages of the manual cover the different aspects of the course editor.  Only the hardcore aficionados are going to take the time on this.  The interface is comprehensive, but there are too many options.  It is not for the faint of heart, and I think I'm going to leave it to the pros on this one.  All in all, PGA Championship Golf 2000 is a great mix of beautiful graphics and entertaining gameplay.  For everything it tries to do, it does it well.  A worthy successor to PGA '99, and a must have for golfers.    -- Mark Birnbaum", "date": "Jun 27, 2000"}
