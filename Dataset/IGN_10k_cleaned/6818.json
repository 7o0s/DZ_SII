Crime Stories is a point and click adventure developed by Artematica and published by The Adventure Company.  Players are cast as Martin Mystere, a professor (not sure of what) who is called in by the police to investigate the murder of another renowned professor.  The game has a somewhat interesting story that does take a great turn near the end, but it's a case of too little, too late.  Crime Stories is plagued by dozens upon dozens of problems before you can get to that redeeming point.  It certainly isn't going to help stave off the rumors of the genre's demise.     The story starts off generically.  Martin gets out of bed and the phone is ringing.  (Why do so many adventure titles start off this way?)  After answering the phone, there is a note on the wardrobe that our lovely wife has taken the key to it, so we cannot get dressed.  So, shocker, we must figure out how to find the key.  In addition, the car is in the shop.  Martin wrote down the mechanic's number somewhere.  On a piece of paper.  That has been ripped in two.  Where's the other half?  Do we not have a yellow pages?  Guess not.  After starting with three of the most generic conventions used in nearly every single adventure title, my hopes had dramatically dimmed.    Meet the protagonist, Martin Mystere Besides the gameplay, the story is also pretty generic at the beginning.  It's never clear what is so special about Professor Mystere that the police call him in on special assignments.  It's also not very believable all the way throughout that a professor would be given so much leeway by the police to proceed with the investigation without police help or guidance.  Martin Mystere is basically investigating the mysterious death of Professor Eulemberg, who was shot in his bed.  This investigation will take players to different locales, from Eulemberg's extravagant Villa to Martin's humble house and from the Blue Rose club (strip joint) to the exotic jungles of Mexico.  The story goes from believable to fantastical very early on, which is actually a plus.  Crime Stories becomes interesting, even capturing interest for a short time, because of those absurd elements.   As for the puzzles, there are no real stumpers.  That's a good thing.  Most of the puzzles make perfect sense in the context of the game.  Listening closely to the dialog (or reading Martin's explanations) is critical to solving many of the puzzles, as the answers are often given there.  Need a code to the safe?  Where did the person you eavesdropped on say that was?  Oh right, the van.  Let me find that - there sure are a lot of numbers on this paper, let me think this through.  Thinking it through is all that is necessary.  However, there aren't really all that many puzzles in the game.  While it is nice they didn't put puzzles in that didn't make any sense to the story just for the sake of adding them, there IS an Aztec temple in the game that could have really lent itself to some serious puzzling.     The majority of gameplay is spent figuring out what objects can be picked up and what to do with them once they are in the inventory.  None of this ever gets too complicated.   However, a major problem the title suffers from is the filler content.  In reality, Crime Stories is a pretty short adventure game.  But, if everything that can be interacted with in the world is clicked, it turns into a much longer game.  Unfortunately, a good portion of interactable objects have no bearing on the story or the gameplay.  Fortunately, after about ten minutes, it's mostly obvious what objects those are, so they can be skipped.  However . . . and here's where it gets tricky . . . sometimes Martin does need those objects that one would think otherwise are unnecessary, so it is pretty easy to get stuck if he doesn't examine every object.  Thankfully, there's no real pixel hunting as most objects are obvious and have large hot zones.  There were a couple instances where what I was looking for was hard to find, but it was rare.   Did I mention the strip club? The system of controls gets the job done.  The menu is simple and has some very nice blurring effects.  Subtitles can be turned on or off.  Right clicking cycles through the three options for interaction (look, use, and talk).  I'm guessing that's the definition of the three options, however, as the manual never does explain them. Dialog and what qualifies as cutscenes can be clicked thru.  They can't be skipped altogether, but being able to click-thru works well enough.  Movement is basic, click and Martin goes there.  A special icon for moving to a different screen appears when that is possible.  The only thing that annoyed me about movement was Martin moves really slowly and in some rooms, this can be frustrating.  Inventory manipulation is standard; objects can be combined, examined or used.   The graphics are pretty good for standard point and click adventures.  The characters and environments are cartoon-like and well-drawn.  The animations, the few there are, are generally above-average for point and clickers.  There are even well-done shadow effects, something we really don't see much of in these types of games.  Now that I've been kind, I'm going to nitpick.  There were many, many, many typos.  It felt like no one ever bothered to read over the dialog scripts before this game went out.  It could have benefited greatly from a cheap payment to a proofreader.  The reason I feel this is an issue is that people who play point and click adventures tend to be extremely literate, and this type of problem would annoy that target audience.  There are also some inconsistencies with dialog.  For example, near the beginning, after we learn the Professor was shot, Martin observes that he doesn't believe it was natural causes. . . .  Right.  Dialog like that really sticks out in a story driven game.   Sound is even more frustrating than the gameplay and graphics issues.  At the end of every subtitle line, the dialog pauses, even if it wouldn't naturally pause.  For example, say I put a period where it doesn't.  Belong in this sentence.  That's what the speaking dialog sounds like.  This is incredibly annoying and occurs even if sub-titles are off.  The music is also odd.  Sometimes there would be a crescendo when entering a room - where nothing would happen.  It felt extremely out of place.Crime Stories is a game that bunts, but is still tagged out at first.  It has some good elements, particularly the later chapters of the game, but it misses in major ways.  Annoyances with the graphics and sound almost drive any interest in seeing the conclusion of the game away.  The gameplay is extremely generic.  The puzzles are easy to figure out, but there aren't very many in the game and some challenge would have been nice.  If a theory of death according the ancient Aztecs sounds interesting to you - this game might worth picking up.  But as far as adventure titles go, there's much better ones out there.", "date": "Apr 10, 2006"}
