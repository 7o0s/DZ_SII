I mean, they actually like it for some reason that you just can't understand. That's kind of like my sick fascination with the Extreme series of games. As bad as they are, I just love to play them. And since my fetish hasn't been tickled since Extreme PaintBrawl 2, imagine the giddy prance I did when Extreme PaintBrawl 4 arrived in the office earlier this week. This totally took me by surprise, and I had feared that my reviews of days past had caused the Extreme series to die quietly, with dignity and poise. But that's not the Extreme style! You have to keep on going, no matter how bad it may be!  Something struck me as odd, though. Given my intense curiosity with the Extreme titles, you would think I would have heard of Extreme PaintBrawl 3 in the two years between 2 and 4, but after doing extensive research on the Internet, I can't find anything that mentions the missing third part of the series. I think it was a secret ploy to keep me away from the Extreme games. They figured if they didn't release Extreme PaintBrawl 3, there's no way I'd expect an Extreme PaintBrawl 4. Well they don't know me! And if you happen to know anything about the whereabouts of number three, please do us all a favor and let me know. Anyway, enough about my secret pain...on to the review!  Installing Extreme PaintBrawl 4 brought back memories of the horrid Extreme games of yore -- and then the install program informed me that I would need at least 400MB of hard drive space to continue installation. There I was thinking, ~Wow! 400 megabytes of hard drive space! This is gonna be good!~ Of course, I have a way of setting myself up for disappointment.  After breezing around the menu system, which is actually fairly slick and well-organized for a budget title, I proceeded to create my own All-Star paintball team -- The Tinklers -- all the while knowing the team from Lou's Dinner would be shaking in their padded chest-plates as Hugh Jass, Dick Gazinya, Amanda Hugginkiz, I.P. Frehley, and crackshot Ben Dover took the field to trade a little paint. This is actually one of the cooler elements of Extreme PaintBrawl 4: in tournament mode you start with $1500 to recruit your team and equip them with guns (aka ~markers~ in paintball terminology), ammo, and cool shirts. As you progress through the game and win more matches, you can buy bigger and better guns and upgrade your teammates' stats. This new feature does add a bit of an RPG element to the paintball experience, but it certainly can't save this title.  Visually Extreme PaintBrawl 4 is a mess. From the low-res textures to the featureless levels to the blocky models to the choppy performance to the...oh hell, it's all bad. Although there are a dozen environments to play in this time around -- ranging from a snowy winterscape to a theatre to an abandoned prison -- everything is really flat, generic and bland. On a high note, you can now play in resolutions up to 1024x768, but why would you want to?  As bad as it looks, where Extreme PaintBrawl 4 ultimately fails is the same place where all of the previous titles have. One of the biggest downfalls of the Extreme PaintBrawl series has always been the AI, or lack thereof, and the fourth installment is no exception. Instead of Artificial Intelligence, it seems as if the programmers have actually utilized Artificial Retardation in Extreme PaintBrawl 4. While it's not nearly as bad as in the previous two iterations (remember, the whereabouts of the third Extreme PaintBrawl is still a mystery), sometimes your enemies will continuously spin 'round and 'round in an attempt to ~evade~ your incoming shots. It's also easy to set up an ambush point to pick off the entire opposing team because they all follow the same routes through each map. There's simply no challenge to it.  Game types include capture the flag, eliminate, gauntlet, and center flag (which is CTF with one flag in the middle), but there's nothing really all that exciting. This reminds me...all of this stiff, boring action is accompanied by this ghastly repetitive speed metal. As a matter of fact, I've never played a game that's as exciting as the music wants to be. Although there are six or so tracks, they pretty much all sound the same, and the game is mired by slow-down whenever a new track loads.   What did you think of Extreme PaintBrawl 4?  While it's got longer legs than its cousins, Extreme PaintBrawl 4 won't keep your attention for long, and you'll be done with this one before you can say ~shoot me in the face with a ball full of paint.~ Online play won't keep you coming back for more, either. Although the ~manual~ (read: pamphlet) says ~finding a game on the net should be easy,~ much to my chagrin, and I mean that since I was really looking forward to sharing my Extreme fascination with someone else, I could never find anyone else playing the game.Extreme PaintBrawl 4 isn't good, but thankfully it isn't horribly, painfully, horrifically, dreadfully, eye-gougingly, crotch-burningly bad like the rest of the PaintBrawl games. It's just pitifully substandard, so at least it's a step in the right direction for the Extreme series. While this was one of the better Extreme games, it's still far from approaching ~fun~ or ~enjoyable.~ It's just a damn shame that this is the exact kind of game that some poor kid is going to get for his or her birthday because Uncle Joe is going to see it in the store and think, ~You know, l'il Timmy likes the paintball.~ It's like my granpappy always used to say, ~Get me a beer, boy. And leave them chickens be!~ But perhaps another one of his phrases is more appropriate in this instance: ~If you bronze a turd, all you have is a shiny piece of crap.~ He was a very prolific man like that.-- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jun 12, 2002"}
