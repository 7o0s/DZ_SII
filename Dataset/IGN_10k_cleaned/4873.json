The latest getting ready for release? None other than the PlayStation's one-time mascot, Crash Bandicoot, which is taking his racing adventure to Nokia's revised -- and revitalized -- handset.   Crash Nitro Kart debuted on consoles last holiday season, where it quickly faded from sight. The uninspiring racing didn't hold a candle against Mario Kart Double Dash!! on the GameCube, and XBox and PlayStation 2 owners were obviously elsewhere with other games.   But that doesn't mean Crash Nitro Kart is a bad game. It was just on the wrong systems. A simplistic little karting game (and that's what Crash Nitro Kart is) seems to be a much better fit on the QD, what with the smaller screen and tighter game play scope. On the Xbox, well, you expect a little more than collecting fruit and firing off homing missiles toward characters that another console made famous. Besides, it's not like the cast members of Crash, outside the titular character, were ever a real household name.   If we had to level a complaint at Crash Nitro Kart, it's that the characters are just too big for the N-Gage screen. They could probably stand to be scaled down a bit so you have a good view of the track, rather than the back of Crash's noggin. So when you race in a pack, the joint gets crowded. As a result, it's sometimes hard to tell where to go until you have a track memorized. And if you're not a fan, you're not going to be playing long enough for that.   Control is pretty decent. Cornering works well (combining brakes with turning) -- it reveals one of the better things about gaming with the N-Gage versus a regular handset. You can actually press more than one input button at a time, namely the control pad and a face button. On regular cellphone games, you're stuck tapping keys individually, which really limits control options.   Crash Nitro Kart supports four-player Bluetooth racing so you can actually jam with several nearby gamers. This is the kind of feature that all future QD games need, and it's good to see it popping up in more games. There are two multiplayer games -- Race and Battle Mode -- so you can either try for times or just duke it out with your karts. Battle Mode is by far the preferable choice if you have enough people with Crash Nitro Kart chips around. You can race against regular ol' bandicoots anytime on your own. You can also upload shadows of your best runs on the N-Gage Arena, but we seriously question how many people are going to bother with that.   As for the looks? Crash Nitro Kart looks slightly better than the original karting game on the PSone, and definitely better than the Game Boy Advance chapter. Sure, the polys have some jagginess, but there is little tearing -- and that's the kind of flaw that really stands out. The colors are incredibly bright and come off quite well on the QD's brighter screen. Animation is nicely detailed -- as well as it needs to be for the game. The framerate is very solid when compared to other N-Gage titles; this is a step up from the recently released Ashen.  Crash Nitro Kart is probably one of the better games in the N-Gage library, and a great title to launch alongside the QD upgrade. If you're looking to pick up a chip with your QD purchase, this one is a solid choice. With all eighteen racers, a slew of tracks, and several gameplay modes, you're going to get some serious mileage out of the game. If the QD was looking to put a good foot to put forward, Crash Nitro Kart is the kind of socks it needs to wear. Bless stretched metaphors.", "date": "Jul 31, 2004"}
