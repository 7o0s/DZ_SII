From the brilliance of Pony Canyon's PC masterpiece Alone in the Dark to the terrible failure that was Infogrames' psychological mess known as The Ring, it's been an interesting ride to say the least -- and one that has seen all manner of premises, backdrops, and unexpected story twists. Amazingly enough one angle that hasn't been tried is to move away from the horror aspect of the genre altogether, and focus on the survival segment alone. That is, until now.   Originally known as Zettai Zetsumei Toshi in Japan and to be called S.O.S. Escape when it's released in Europe, Irem's Disaster Report is the type of project that says a lot about its designers. Innovative, creative, complex, and overly ambitious, D-Report has the makings of something that could end up becoming quite the special dish. And though it borrows the familiar ~deserted island~ ideal from older inspirations like Blue Stinger and Code: Veronica, all other remaining comparisons can stop right there. As this time around your hero isn't protecting himself from rabid flesh-eating zombies or oversized wasp creatures -- not at all. It's Mother Nature who has your number in this installment. And a series of powerful, destructive earthquakes the means by which she seeks to destroy you.   Unfortunately the game has other enemies out to destroy you as well: it's just too bad they're all unintentional. Poor play mechanics and dreadful visual presentation can upstage even the greatest of ideas after all, and with the competition tossing out its elaborate scare-fests left and right (re: Capcom and Konami), it's going to take a lot more than a few interesting approaches to win the hands of thousands of dedicated gamers.   Gameplay  Disaster Report has been tagged as a combination of ICO and Blue Stinger, and in all fairness, that's a pretty good comparison (though it's definitely closer to the former in terms of concept). Encouraging the player to move in unison with your companion Karen while traveling from place to place, your main goal is to survive each section without killing yourself or your partner. You can press the ~shout~ button for instance, in order to remind her to follow you or find other people while picking up items and keys as you go along. It's all pretty familiar really, and to say that Disaster Report gives the player a distinct feeling of dj vu is quite the understatement.    How the developers have tried to make the experience a little bit different, however, is what makes the game stand out above everything else. To begin with, your main character is given two meters instead of the usual one. The standard health bar chimes in as one of them obviously, but the second is an innovative number called the thirst gauge. Depleted as your character expends energy and dashes from place to place, the thirst gauge can only be replenished by drinking water before you run out. Get lazy and allow your character to lose his hydration, and your character can no longer sprint and will slowly lose health until he drinks again. It's a cool idea and one that is sure to catch on in various other forms from now on.    Another interesting addition is the ability to form your own tools out of rogue equipment. In one section of the game for instance, you'll need to build a raft in order to traverse the waterway. Collect a rope, bench wood, oil drum, and a few other specific items and you can assemble them for a makeshift boat. Keep in mind, this is only one example of the types of things you can create throughout your adventure, but you get the general idea. The designers definitely deserve a pat on the back for that one.   Unfortunately Disaster Report is riddled with problems and reasons to get angry. Amazingly sluggish and unresponsive, Keith moves around as though he were bumping into invisible walls. Even when engaged in a full sprint, turning another direction or hopping over a small obstacle stops your model immediately as it slowly moves through its transition animation. Once the animation has finished, your character will surprisingly start running again as though nothing had ever happened -- and if sounds bizarre to imagine while playing, it feels about the same way on your Dual Shock. In fact, the only moment where Disaster Report even comes close to paying attention to what you're doing on the controller is when you have to catch yourself from falling; only then does it react with lightning-fast reflexes. Performing every day activities like walking back and forth, turning to your right and left, or stopping to grab an item mid-stride proves far too taxing for the game to handle at a normal speed. Reality-based interaction is apparently too intense for the engine to handle.   Other big problems center on the game's difficulty; easily beaten in just a few hours, the simplistic puzzles and obvious solutions to each dilemma don't do much in discouraging you from keeping this as a rental only. Even when played in hard mode Disaster Report is nothing more than your basic exercise in trial and error mind challenges that allows you to continue almost immediately where you left off. Why even need to save the game if you can just go ahead and pick up where you died regardless of the circumstances? Come to think of it, why are there so many save spots to begin with? Giving the player no penalty at all for an overuse of saves and far too generous in terms of memory cars spots, there's no need to worry about saving your game at all -- especially since the game can be defeated in the span of a short afternoon. We can only imagine that it's because of the multiple story paths and seven varied endings, but even then, is there reason enough to play through this sucker seven different times? Once or twice through sure, but more than that and the control scheme could frustrate you into suicidal tendencies.    Graphics  To put it as delicately as possible the visuals in Disaster Report are borderline terrible. Washed out in a sea of stone color and gray undertones, the pale, almost soupy graphics dissolve away in comparison to just about every single survival horror game out there. If you're familiar with the original PSX version of Silent Hill for instance, you might find some semblance of reference; but even in that last-generation effort, there was at least an attempt at changing the palette to avoid the monochromatic merry-go-round that you'll find here.    The culprits of course are the terribly realized polygonal models. Horrifically basic and detailed with fewer textures than first-generation Saturn games, the characters in Disaster Report are incredibly bad; as are the animations they're presented with. Running at just one notch above slow motion, the lackadaisical movements of the main protagonists are so labored that I often wondered if there was a problem with the PlayStation 2. But to no surprise, it wasn't.   The first-person camera also posed somewhat of a problem. Needed to find some of the more difficult items and hidden goodies throughout the debris, it's an indispensable asset when it comes to locating some of the better tool pieces. Sadly, it's hard to aim it in the direction you'd most like to explore and makes the poor texture work even more apparent at close range. Speaking of cameras, the third-person version isn't too hot either -- as it will frequently get caught behind obstacles, tilt the wrong way, and display a good number of bothersome glitches.   Sound  There isn't much to speak of in this department as the soundtrack is practically non-existent with almost no music to accompany the player. Understandably it's a clever design choice to emphasize the lonely surroundings of our heroes Keith and Karen, and it's a move I approve of whole-heartedly. Gamers who can't stand uncomfortable silences, however, may not like it in the least.   Vocals on the other hand are downright awful and hearken back to the days of the Sega CD and its invasion of B-level narration. Repetitive and simple, the vocal iterations that we're treated to can be counted with less than all ten fingers, and other than radio broadcasts and a few story-related cut scenes, offer up very little in terms of character direction. Disaster Report is a quiet, quiet game my friends. But at least the ambient special effects and frequent rumbling sounds great.What could have been one of the most refreshing titles on the PlayStation 2 ultimately ends up becoming one of its most disappointing. While it's visuals give new meaning to the words eyesore and the mechanics leave a lot to be desired, it's still feasible that fans of the genre will get into it (even after discovering all of its shortcomings I was still intrigued by it somehow), and the multiple story paths and seven endings should help a lot too (which it needs, since the game only offers around four hours of exploration or so).What it all boils down to, though, is that Disaster Report is a premise unrealized; Clunky, ugly, and yet bizarrely progressive, Irem's latest survival attempt earns a couple of points for ingenuity and a handful of legitimate thrill-ride type moments. What it doesn't earn, however, is my recommendation. I just pray that Irem doesn't give up on the idea and goes back to fix D-Report's shortcomings in a sequel. -- Because if there was ever a title that deserved a second chance in this crazy videogame world of ours, it's definitely this one.", "date": "Feb 20, 2003"}
