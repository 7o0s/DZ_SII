And in Godai Elemental force 3DO's newest ~ninja~ action game the five big refers to the five ancient elements of earth, wind, fire, water and... void.  Void?  Hey, if you don't remember that one, don't worry neither do I.  In the still of the night, the Queen lays her newborn son in his crib as a shadow steals past the window.  She looks up and sees... nothing.  Suddenly ninjas crash through the windows attacking the Queen.  The King arrives just in time to have his wife die in his arms.  He fends off the ninjas from taking his son until, Akunin, the lord of the Void Ninjas slaughters the King.  Akunin reaches for the crib and realizes the baby is nowhere to be seen.  Master Sho runs from the castle baby in hand.  The young prince Hiro, is safe for now.    20 years later Hiro is training with Master Sho in the ancient art of Sukoto Taijutsu and the magic of the elements.  Upon Master Sho's deathbed Hiro learns the truth of his past, and the threat of Akunin.  Now it's up to Hiro to master the magic of the elements, Godai and stop Akunin from ruling the world.  Gameplay You start off in the elemental garden.  The only level open is the gate of wind.  Defeating this world, unlocks the gates of fire, water, and earth.  Each gate contains three levels, and upon reaching the end of the third level a boss appears.  After killing the boss, Godai rewards you with the elemental magic of the stage.  Wind magic forms a wind barrier around you, water heals you gradually over time, fire increases your attack, and earth gives you armor.    Casting magic requires you to have your magic bar full.  You slowly regain magic as time passes.  Switching magic requires you to press the access inventory button and the magic button to cycle through the different spells.  This is the same way you change weapons and sub-weapons (Throwing stars, smoke bombs, etc.).  Now this tended to get me in trouble, because the access inventory was in real time.  The game does not pause while you cycle through your stuff.  I would find myself on countless occasions trying to switch spells to heal and during this time the enemy would take advantage and send a barrage of throwing stars in my general direction while skeleton warriors barbecued me at point blank.  There are a wide variety of weapons in Godai.  You start off with nothing.  No sword, no magic, nothing.  Breaking pots and defeating enemies produce weapons.  Weapons you can use to break more pots and kill more enemies... it's an endless cycle!  But at least you have a lot to choose from, spears, swords, sais, and double swords.  Having two swords is cool, but it seemed like it was more of a cosmetic change.  (The swords did more damage than punching, of course.)  Wow I've got two swords now, but I'm doing the same amount of damage as if I had one.  I didn't realize weapons dealt different amounts of damage until I reached the first boss.  I was actually having a lot of trouble with the Wind Boss, until I replayed the level and found a hidden weapon that I used to completely thrash that stupid Wind Boss into oblivion.    Weapons take damage.  Different weapons have varying weapon points.  Collecting an anvil icon replenishes the weapon points of the particular weapon in hand.  This causes another opportunity for the access inventory button to make life very uncomfortable.  Let's say the weapons in your arsenal are all about to break, so you decide to go commando and take out those ninjas with your bare knuckles.  In the midst of battle you come across an anvil.  Cool, I don't have to deal squat damage anymore, I'll just switch up to sword and... oh wait, in the midst of changing weapons three ninjas (Not the ones at mega mountain)  just decided to gang up on me and give me the beat down.  I'm dead.  Sucks doesn't it?  A lot of the background can be destroyed.  Not all of it, but a lot.  Pots, boxes, statues, even the strange steam spewing concrete towers can be smashed.  It's not a huge leap in video game programming, but it's still neat.  I love it when games have backgrounds to smash like the star shooting pagodas and dried up corpses.  Godai has the strangest looking jump I have ever seen in my life.  Granted it's not listed as jump, it's listed as glide and that's essentially what you do, glide.  Pressing the glide button once causes Hiro to leap into the air, produce a white cloud, (You tell me what you think he's doing.), and hover slowly to the ground.  Pressing glide while gliding cancels the glide sending you crashing to the ground.  This was fun for the first hour or so, but then it just got silly and not silly good, but silly bad.  I want my normal jump.  The hover jump should have been a feature, where if you held the button down the character would hover, not hover then hit glide to stop hovering.    The other problem I had with the ~glide~ button is the fact I couldn't jump when I was next to a wall.  Let me explain, I could jump, but if I pressed towards the wall when I jumped, I couldn't.  I assume the game thought, ~Oh he's trying to jump into the wall. You can't do that silly boy.~  This wouldn't have been a problem if I was actually trying to jump into walls, but when I came across large rocks or columns I wanted to leap onto, Hiro would just stand there vibrating slightly.  I would have to back off, press glide, and then move the character onto the top of the platform.  The game seemed to have a life of its own sometimes.  Not only did the game crash, (Yes I was playing a finished copy.), but weird stuff would happen constantly.  I would be navigating my way through a series of rooms, defeating all the enemies in the room would open the door to the next.  But sometimes, just sometimes the door would creak open just a third of the way.  Enough room for me to exit, but weird nonetheless.  I don't know if it was programmed that way because all the other doors opened fine.    The other strange instance was a little more annoying than the first.  I came across a magma lake with a small island in the middle.  On the island was a button.  I ~glided~ to the island and pressed the button causing a cut sequence to occur showing me the next place to go.  Now you're thinking, ~Okay, so that's pretty normal.~.  But right before the cut scene, this ninja knocks me off the island into the magma.  As the game shows me the next place to go I can hear Hiro screaming and sounds of him getting barbecued.  The sequence ends and 2/3 of my health are gone!  I had a full bar!  What's up with that?  I thought it might be part of that cut scene, (Actually I had a feeling it wasn't.) so I reset and tried again.  This time I maneuvered my way around the ninja, pressed the button, the sequence ended, and I came out unscathed.  Weird.  Godai supports a two player ~Ninja Duel~ mode.  In this mode, you can go one on one with one of your friends and fight to the death.  It reminds me of Power Stone without the guns and cool turrets you could jump into.  There are however various pots to break and weapons to collect.  I played this mode for about five minutes until I realized I wasn't having any fun at all.  You're trapped in a very confined space with another ninja who's either throwing stars at you or poking you with a spear.  One cool feature is every time you defeat a boss you unlock a new character for the Ninja Duel.  And the unlocked character is not the boss as you might think, no, it's a ninja with the boss' element.  The strange thing was that when I picked the fire ninja, he started off with water magic.  Fire ninjas should not have water magic, it's just not natural.  Fire ninja with water magic, that's an oxymoron, like jumbo shrimp or Microsoft Works.  Graphics This game looks pretty bad.  The character designs are awful.  Who came up with Hiro's hairstyle?  Where does this game take place?  Japan?  China?  And if it is one of those countries I weep for that culture.  The framerate is really low and is really noticeable when you cast magic.  The game slows down and the camera spins around the character, while he wigs out casting his spell.  I can hear the excuse right now, ~We wanted it to look like that!~.  Sure you did.  The camera seems to have a mind of it's own.  I would be running away form an enemy and the camera would move into a position where it would just shake causing me to suffer motion sickness.  Sometimes while walking against a wall the camera would go inside the wall, so I couldn't see anything until I moved in a different direction.  Other times the camera would take to the skies and I'd be left with an angle that made me feel like I was playing Grand Theft Auto 2.  The most annoying camera move is the zoom out.  For no reason whatsoever the camera would zoom out leaving you a speck on the screen while you duke it out with other specks, eliminating such features as depth perception, the ability to determine where I was, and fun.    Sound The music is great.  It's this nice ancient Asian theme music that's not too intrusive.  And the best part is it's not that stereotypical offensive oriental beat (You know, like Tajiri's WWF intro music.).    The voices on the other hand are horrendous.  I couldn't even tell if Hiro was speaking English, half the time.  ~Koreda!~ which translates to ~this is it~ in Japanese, was the closest I could come to what Hiro says when he enters a level. This game is bad.  It looks bad, plays bad, and sounds bad.  I know I said the music is great, but the voices are so annoying I had to turn off the sound.  Godai is also one of the worst representations of the Japanese culture I have ever witnessed.  It's not even funny bad, like Big Trouble in Little China, I realize this is not Japanese but you get the idea.  Granted the game might not be trying to be Japanese (yeah right.) but if it is, the game shouldn't have items such as sushi that regains your health.  Sushi replenishing health?  That's just poor.  The game feels like they asked some guy who knew nothing about the Japanese culture to make a game with ninjas.  ~Ninjas are cool, I watched all three Ninja Turtles movies and they were awesome!~  I highly recommend against buying this game, if you must rent it first.  And like everybody in the office has said to me at one point while I was playing Godai, ~I wish this game would Go Die!~", "date": "Feb 7, 2002"}
