Capcom's Street Fighter II wasn't the first game in its genre, but its gameplay refined and defined what one-on-one character combat was all about  unforgettable foes, uncounterable combos and unbelievable special moves. Unfortunate, though, will be gamers seeking a fully-featured street fight here. This Virtual Console version is as limited an edition of the game as was ever made, an emulation of Street Fighter II's clean and basic SNES debut.    It was 1991, and the arcade scene had long been dormant. American gamers' love affair with coin-op cabinets had faded years earlier, most players having happily adopted a console or computer to continue their habit at home. Those games that were still arriving in quarter slot form were evolving, building up the brawler as the new most popular arcade genre. Capcom was a major player in fueling that evolution, slowly rousing the sleeping scene with titles like Final Fight and the first Street Fighter in the late '80s  but it wasn't until the release of the sequel, Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, that the arcade craze was truly reawakened.   Street Fighter II was made for competition. A one-on-one fighting game, it encouraged two players to throw down against one another, challenging each other for pride, bragging rights and control of the machine. Few games hold more satisfaction for the winner than Street Fighter II. It's incredibly gratifying to be playing the game, have some random fool walk up and drop a quarter in to challenge you, and then absolutely destroy him with your superior level of skill. Maybe you give him just a slight grin as he retreats from the controls, defeated, his tail between his legs. Maybe you act like you never saw him at all.    Such is the appeal of the Fight, and it's player vs. player interactions like that that led SFII to become one of the most popular fighters of all time. The game presents an array of selectable characters with a variety of looks and abilities, from traditional martial artists Ryu and Ken to the sumo wrestler E. Honda. There's Guile, an American Army man. There's Zangief, the Russian, pile-driving powerhouse. There's high-flying Chun Li and arm-stretching Dhalsim, and Blanka, the electric Oompa-Loompa.  Every Street Fighter player finds a favorite, and seeks to master their signature moves.   Button combinations call upon these secret techniques, more powerful and more flashy than the game's otherwise basic punches and kicks. Guile can throw a spinning crescent of energy called the Sonic Boom, activated by holding back on the joystick for two seconds and then hitting forward and punch simultaneously. E. Honda can strike his enemies with a 100-Hand Slap, triggered by repeated mashing of any punch button. Dhalsim can breathe balls of fire, and so on and so forth. It took both conversation with other players and dedicated practice to learn about each characters' maneuvers, and thousands of gamers emptied millions of rolls of quarters trying to master Ryu's quarter-rolls.   When it became obvious that they had a hit on their hands, Capcom capitalized in two ways  the first was to port their product to a home machine, the Super NES, and the second was to release a vast array of upgraded Street Fighter II versions into the arcades. The later editions of the game made playable more characters, added new moves, and enhanced the balance between the different fighters. But those were the later editions. This VC release isn't them.   This is an emulation of that first-ever port, the July 1992 release that makes available only the first eight fighters. It was a huge boost to the SNES game library to receive this first home conversion of Street Fighter II then, 15 years ago, and gamers of the day flocked to its faithful re-creation of the arcade experience. But in the 15 years since, Street Fighter has evolved. Fighter fans are used to having more now  more characters, more stages, more options. This first version of SFII feels restricted. It's nostalgic, but limited. You'll want more.   More enhancements, more bells and whistles. More features, like online play. Like the Xbox Live Arcade version. True, the edition of Street Fighter II currently being enjoyed by 360 gamers isn't perfect, plagued as it is by lag and other frustrating failings. And true, a direct comparison is difficult to make  the Virtual Console has made no promises of enhancing or upgrading its classic games. But Street Fighter II will be a comparison point regardless, especially considering its equivalency in pricepoint. The Xbox download costs 800 Microsoft Points. The Nintendo version, 800 Wii Points. There are even rumors circulating now that the game will come to the PS3, through the PlayStation Store. It seems we may be seeing the beginning of a new resurgence, where a flood of Street Fighters will arrive to once again claim the time and money of nostalgic players. Don't be washed away.  Wait and save your Points for better, more fully-featured versions of this game. Street Fighter II Turbo, Super Street Fighter II and Street Fighter Alpha 2 could all potentially come to the service in the future, and that's just from the SNES back catalog. Any of them would be more worth your while, as you'd likely enjoy playing this version, but would quickly tire of its restricted scope and roster of only the eight original fighters. Street Fighter II: The World Warrior revolutionized the fighting genre and brought arcades back from the dead in the early '90s  but there are better ways to re-experience that era than this particular download.", "date": "Jan 17, 2007"}
