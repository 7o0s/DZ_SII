It's already one of the best selling titles for the PlayStation, and with good reason. Never has a game combined excellent graphics with heart-stopping action and a great story in such a way as to create an almost cinematic adventure. You really do feel like you're participating in a movie. It's amazing.  At the heart of Resident Evil lies its basic, graphic-adventure premise. Zombies have come alive, and you (as one of two story-specific characters) must investigate the freaky goings on. The graphics are gorgeous, combining polygon-modeled characters with prerendered backgrounds. Camera angles are limited, but allow for a greater degree of detail on the characters. You really do identify with the protagonists, something lacking in many games.  The game moves along at a brisk pace, with enough action sequences to balance out the relatively easy puzzles. Resident Evil is a masterpiece, and one game no one should be without.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
