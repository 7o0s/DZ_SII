The original arcade game had been spectacular: a fantasy-themed, two-player brawler with great graphics and sound. The home console port to the Genesis had to be cut down a bit, but that was okay -- any compromise in look would surely be fixed by the time SEGA got around to the sequel, right? Sadly, Golden Axe II just didn't meet fans' expectations.   It was more of the same. The same watered-down visuals, the same stilted sound. The same three characters to choose from, same play style... the list goes on. Golden Axe II didn't innovate in any way, and it's not surprising, in retrospect, that the disappointment surrounding this game caused Golden Axe III to stay a SEGA Channel exclusive.    Once again, the kingdom is at war. Having met and defeated the villainous Death Adder in battle years ago, the three heroes Ax Battler, Tyris Flare and Gilius Thunderhead thought their fighting days were done -- until the rise of a new evil foe, Dark Guld. Guld has managed to claim the power of the legendary Golden Axe, and it's up to Ax, Tyris and Gilius to hack and slash their way through his minions, take him on, and recapture the stolen weapon.   See, even the story's a rehash. The fighters have changed just a bit in the few years since the first game's conclusion, with each one now having access to a slightly upgraded moveset. But the basics are the same right down to their control and animations. Double-tapping the D-Pad starts a charge; the B Button swings their weapon, the C Button leaps (buttons being changed depending on your choice of gamepad, of course, but an in-game menu allows you to assign them wherever you'd like).   The only alteration in control scheme is with magic. In the first Golden Axe, collecting dropped potions filled up your character's magic meter -- more potions meant more powerful spell attacks, but all of your gathered vials would be drained away when you hit the magic attack button. This time, you've got more of a choice: you can opt to spend every bit of the meter at once for a massive strike, or you can dispense your sorcery bit by bit with lesser, but more frequent, magical attacks.   Hard to call those magic system upgrades an innovation, of course. That change is more of a fix for something that should have been in the first title, which again, leaves Golden Axe II wanting for something distinct, some feature to call its own. It doesn't really find it.Though the game has its merits and can be fun to play with a friend, there just isn't anything noteworthy about Golden Axe II that would set it above its own predecessor. It's like a rerun of the scene from 1989. If you haven't played either game and want to, then this sequel gets the very slight nod on the merits of its minor improvements, like the upgraded magic attack system. But only the most nostalgic of SEGA fans should consider owning both, because it's like having the same game twice.", "date": "Jun 11, 2007"}
