Super Fruitfall is a puzzle game that involves spinning around the playfield in order to combine and erase pieces of fruit. It's fun and deceptively-strategic, but the game has a few issues with unsolvable situations and lack of mode variation that may drive away casual gamers.    With each puzzle, the player is given a floating, enclosed area filled with tiny fruit pieces and asked to rotate the playfield until the same fruits are touching, at which point, in typical puzzle game fashion, they vanish. It would seem that having only three moves available to the player  flip left, flip right, and rotate 180 degrees  would limit the possibilities of the game, with most puzzles solvable by rotating at random. While this might be true for earlier levels, later ones are filled with so many nooks that the fruits must be spun in a very particular order in order to accomplish anything.    The majority of the puzzles in the game can be beaten in about a minute, which helps the portability of the game. Unfortunately, there's very little in this package beyond that one, fun gameplay mechanic. There are three game modes available, but each plays pretty identically. In Arcade Mode, the player builds up time by completing puzzles and plays through as many levels as possible until the accrued time runs out. In Time Trial Mode, the player attempts to set a best time per puzzle and then, upon subsequent playthroughs, beat it. In Practice Mode, the player can access any previously-reached level and play through it without any timer considerations.    If these modes don't sound all that interesting, it's because they're not. While the core gameplay is solid, turning a clock on and off to stretch the experience into three selectable modes feels pretty weak. The developers should have offered more genuine variation, such as limiting a puzzle by number of available moves, or requiring fruit to be disposed of in a particular order. Instead, regardless of which mode is selected, the player will be doing basically the same thing over and over.    Another minor complaint is that later on in the game, many puzzles have uneven numbers of fruit pieces. So while three oranges touching always forms a combo, a level may have four oranges, requiring that all pieces combo at once or else the game ends prematurely. This feels like such a departure from the rest of the game, where rotating can usually be done without consequence. I think if the developers had separated these failure-inducing puzzles into a separate mode, it would have work better and been less frustrating for players that just want to spin without taking chess-like moments of consideration before each move.    Rotate fruit and make them fall.   Even on levels where the fruit counts are even, it's still possible to get stuck. If the remaining pieces are organized so that no fruits are able to combo, and the level borders are wide enough to never split the fruit up, creating a combo will be impossible. The same thing happens when only a few fruits remain, but keep getting caught in the same corners of the playfield with each spin. This doesn't happen too often but when it does occur, it feels like a cheat since there's nothing to do at that point except spin the fruit idly until time runs out. The developers should have made sure every level design was free of these sloppy possibilities before throwing them in the game.    There's a single-DS two-player mode available where each player holds one half of the DS, with the same puzzle displayed on both screens. Players then compete, one using the control pad and one using the four face buttons, to solve the puzzle before their opponent. It works surprisingly well and kids will probably appreciate the fact that a second DS isn't required, let alone a second copy of the game. A gamesharing mode is also available that streams a sample of the game to an empty DS for friends to give a whirl. It's a shame there isn't a full two-player wireless mode available, but both these alternatives help lessen the blow.    Art in the game is consistently plain, although flashy graphics probably wouldn't have added too much to a game like this. There's little variation in fruit level to level, but the art for the playfields change every few puzzles, as do the backgrounds. Thankfully every piece of fruit is vividly-colored and easily distinguishable. Menus are lively and bouncy, and the interface is intuitive and engaging. Music and sound effects are a little soft, but match the feel of the game. At its core, Super Fruitfall has a strong core gameplay mechanic. But the lack of any real mode variations and impressive visuals scream budget title. Sloppy execution of some of the puzzles also allows players to get stuck, something a good puzzle game should never do. Puzzle addicts who enjoy the simplicity of games like Tetris might be able justify spending twenty bucks, in spite of the games flaws. But casual gamers would do better to start with one of Nintendo's own puzzle games first.", "date": "Dec 5, 2007"}
