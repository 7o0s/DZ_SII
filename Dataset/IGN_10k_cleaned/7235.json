With that out of the way, we're free to talk about the many inventive ways that developer Dartmoor has managed to cram an entire oil spill into a box and charge twenty bucks for it. Hey, at least it's easier to wipe off your hard drive than it is to clean a puffin with a toothbrush and a bottle of Palmolive.  The current world situation, both here in the US and abroad, suggests that a tycoon game about the oil industry would be a hot commodity. The entire industry is very prominent now and regardless of your personal views of the commercial, political, technological or environmental agenda of these companies, it's a safe bet that you'd like to actually learn more about how the industry works. Big Oil has nothing to do with any of those issues.   Throughout its fifteen scenarios (and in the free play mode), Big Oil basically boils down to a production race between you and your rivals. You pay for rights, find an oil field, set up your oil towers and storage tanks and then ship the black gold off to a refinery. There are other components to the game but they're merely sideshows to the main event. There are some historical events sprinkled here and there, but they seem to have little effect on the game except to change the price of oil.  While it costs money to get your oil business up and running, it's remarkably difficult to go broke in this game. Sure, you can find yourself in the negative if your spending gets out of hand but there's really no challenge here in terms of managing the finances. In most scenarios you'll just have to sit back and wait until you've earned enough money to win.  On easy mode, you'll be paired up with an advisor who constantly interrupts you to alert you to the various opportunities and shortcomings in your empire. While it's nice to have someone looking out for you, the fact that he is constantly making suggestions means you can play the game on autopilot. ~Want to drill? Want to build a tower? How about a tanker? Some pipeline?~ Ugh! Enough already! What's worse is that the advisor will frequently remind you to do things you've already done! Yes, I know I need a refinery! I've already built one! Oh, it needs to be connected? That's odd; the pipeline has been in place for four days!   Sadly, graduating to the more difficult mode ramps up the management to an insane degree and leaves you to figure it all out yourself. (There is no tutorial and the manual is poorly organized and incomplete.) It's almost as if the developers forgot to include a few mid-range difficulty levels in between these two. The micromanagement of workers, ships and even the components of your refineries may add more gameplay to Big Oil but it certainly doesn't make it any more comprehensible or fun.  The only way the rival companies have any real interaction with each other is by buying and selling stock. As far as I can tell the stock market is basically just a bank. Companies sell stock to raise money and buy it as an investment in the future. While some might argue that that's the way stocks are supposed to work, Big Oil never really takes it farther than that. I've yet to see one company buy a controlling interest in another  Big Oil really takes a turn for the bizarre when players are suddenly tasked with maintaining social services that seem more in line with SimCity than an oil tycoon game. Sure, I know the Rockefellers and Mellons of the world built their share of hospitals and universities but the fact that the player is the only one responsible for maintaining the health and education levels in refinery towns seems like a desperate attempt to add complexity to the game without considering whether or not it made any sense. In any case, no one should expect oil barons to build ice skating rinks when they're broke.      The interface is nearly impenetrable at either difficulty setting. It requires much searching to find the information you need and, even if you find it, there's no guarantee that it will be in a format that you can even understand. The various graphics, charts and spreadsheets in the game are so poorly laid out that they serve only to confuse the player. Issuing commands is also much more of a chore than it needs to be. Setting build orders or creating routes for your tankers has a very high mouse click-to-result ratio. Since the whole game boils down to building towers, pipelines and storage tanks, those options should be right up front the whole time.  The tanker system by which you transport oil to a city that has a refinery is broken. Assuming you get the route set up correctly, tankers will stop to pick up oil where it's being collected. Rather than waiting at the docks until they get a full load, the tankers will collect what's there and then sail away for a  few days and come back when they can top off. Dumber still, these tankers will travel for days at a time in a completely random direction before finally deciding to go where you told them to.    The game includes a rather sizable tech tree but most of the techs are pointless except as prerequisites to the handful of genuinely useful techs on the tree. Having to research something like ten different technologies just to build refineries is ridiculous. Why not just lump them all together and keep the player from having to jump back and forth to the tech labs every few weeks? Hell, at least let players queue up these useless techs so they're not distracting us every few minutes with unnecessary research requests.  Should you find another player willing to take you on (and you just happen to know his IP) Big Oil is theoretically playable online. We're not even going to talk about that.  We're also not going to talk much about the game's frequent bugs. Let's just say I had a game where the oil I sold took money out of my bank account. Guh?   Graphically, Big Oil is a mess. The cities are boring and chunky. Smoke from the factories and cars on the roads give a good imitation of life, but the cities have absolutely no personality. The environments are even more featureless. Sure, you'll get the odd tree here and there but the whole earth is divided into only two climate zones -- green and yellow. I like being able to zoom out and see the whole world and get a view of all my interests at once but that's just not a perspective you can play the game from.There's nothing wrong with the basic concept of Big Oil but the actual execution leaves a lot to be desired, even considering the twenty-dollar price tag. The player is thrown into the fray with little explanation of how things work. That's okay because things don't make much sense in this game anyway. I'd still love to see a game that actually dealt with the complex issues oil companies have faced in the last 100 years, but Big Oil definitely isn't it.", "date": "Sep 14, 2006"}
