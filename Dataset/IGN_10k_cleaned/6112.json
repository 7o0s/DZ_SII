It's everyone's favorite elephant in the bedroom, a fount of endless speculation about everything from grand strategic military operations like Operation Barbarossa and controversial political programs such as Lend-Lease, right down to the tactical merits of war doctrines like blitzkrieg (~lightning war~) and tank-fighting dogs.  While it took first-person shooters like Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, Battlefield 2, and Brothers in Arms to finally crack open the era to a new crop of 3D-besotted gamers, the strategic nuances that among other things had a hand in kick-starting the gaming genre decades ago have all but vanished - relegated to low-production ~boutique~ offerings from developers who cater to a niche fan base.    Nival Interactive's Blitzkrieg 2 aims to change at least some of that by marrying the vocabulary and tactical rudiments of yesteryear's austere turn-based World War 2 bean counters with the relentless, frenetic pacing of a real-time strategy click-a-thon.  The original Blitzkrieg was a fast-paced ground combat game that combined some light historical dressing with accurately represented artillery, tanks, trucks, and infantry units.  While it was sort-of-kind-of based around actual World War II battles, the crux of what it did well and with at least a sniff of innovation were the unit-to-unit combat mechanics, which grafted esoteric turn-based concepts more or less successfully onto a traditional battalion-scale real-time system.  If you think somewhere between the creeping fidelity of Atomic's Close Combat games and the relaxed historicity of Fireglow's Sudden Strike series, you're not far from the mark.  Blitzkrieg was far from perfect, though, and its shortcomings included an awkward user interface, a dated 2D game engine, and a slew of localization issues that made the presentation seem half-baked and stylistically lackluster.   Blitzkrieg 2 goes a long way toward solving some of those issues by fork-lifting in a nifty 3D engine, cleaning up the information panel, and making better use of context-sensitive information.  This is one of those games with scads of information to chew on, and where the original already had around 200 units, this one bumps things up to 250, including new tanks, artillery, planes, naval ships, and 60 types of infantry.  Each unit is a rolling trove of data, from the historical annotations in the encyclopedia to the numerous in-game statistics such as historically relative ratings for front, side, and rear vehicle armor.  The mini-map in the lower-left-hand corner of the screen is now flat instead of isometric, greatly improving distance gauging, and instead of several smallish buttons crammed together, the bottom panel now looks a lot more like something you'd find in a Blizzard or Westwood Studios game.  A slick 3D micro-view aside the mini-map quickly displays the relevant statistics of a highlighted unit, a wide middle panel lists currently selected units by type and group, and the actions panel is a blissfully simplified and enlarged 4 x 3 grid of buttons, many of which don't appear until the requisite unit-specific command points have been spent.   As in Blitzkrieg, resource gathering is non-existent, and the focus in each mission is instead on harmonizing unit actions to achieve either offensive or defensive goals before running short of reinforcements.  The game is divided into three campaigns: the United States just after the Pearl Harbor attack at the end of 1941, Germany on the march through Russia in 1941, and the Soviet Union on the defensive in 1941.  Each campaign is subdivided into four chronological chapters which comprise a frontline operation in a given theater, and there are four difficulty levels which determine the size of enemy forces and the firing accuracy of individual units.  Your role as the commander in each campaign is to use combined-arms tactics to complete a refreshingly diverse array of mission types, including assaults on strategic points, capturing townships, escorting special units, seizing enemy bases, and defending fortified locations.  Completion of a mission yields promotion points which in turn allow you to appoint commanders to improve reinforcement options and rank up unit abilities.  Common infantry will eventually get grenade clusters, aircraft will be able to fly in bad weather, tanks will be able to fire on the move, and so on, giving the game a modest RPG feel.  There's a final apocalyptic slug-out in each chapter that can only be played once a certain number of the lesser preliminary missions are completed.    The historical scenarios this time around include big guns like Stalingrad, Iwo Jima, Tobruk, Moscow, and the Battle of the Bulge, but we're talking loose outlines only.  As with any battalion level click-and-fling-into-the-breach RTS, scripting the events to resemble actual history is probably a fool's errand, and we're talking history-through-ambience here, as opposed to something as literal as a Combat Mission scenario.  But if the demographics of the historical battles only generally resemble actual historical events, it's the modeling of the units themselves with all their varied abilities that makes Blitzkrieg 2 more than just another quasi-complex RTS.  Infantry will toss grenades at tanks if they get up close and personal; engineers can dig trenches, repair damaged units and bridges, and set or disarm mines; supply trucks can carry ammo from supply depots to field units, haul artillery units, and transport slow-moving infantry quickly around the battlefield; reconnaissance aircraft can help adjust artillery fire, but lack weapons making them sitting ducks for enemy fighters; tanks come in three sizes that make them more or less effective against different types of hard and soft targets, and functionally useless in certain terrain types.  The game is literally brimming with units like these, not a single one the same, and every one uniquely necessary for a given tactical situation.  I'm not diehard enough about the war to tell you whether they've got the precise power relationship between, say, a Panzer IV Ausfhrung E and an M4A3 General Sherman bang on, but it's a huge relief to discover that yes, in fact, a heavy machine gunner is not going to be taking down either of these beasts anytime soon, as he lacks an appropriate caliber weapon.  As in real life, tanks are well plated on the front and sides, but anemic in the rear.  If you've ever played games from Talonsoft or HPS Simulations you'll be right at home with wargame concepts such as entrenchment, armor slope and penetration characteristics, and armored vehicle facing, and while you can argue it's not terribly innovative, Nival deserves credit for doing it in a World War II venue better than anyone else to date.    The AI behind the curtain does a nice job of peppering you with things to react to, while keeping it tactically interesting.  Its one shortcoming -- the bane of all RTS games -- is its pathfinding system.  In open spaces, everything behaves, but try hauling a dozen tanks across a bridge and once the bridge is packed with six of them, you'll find the other half turning around to find another crossing point.  This has been, and continues to be a problem for most RTS games -- it's past time for someone to fix this once and for all.   Aircraft, which were previously automated, can now be controlled directly, though this brings up another of the game's problems.  Fighters are launched from the reinforcements panel and appear instantly, circling and strafing the battlefield.  You can zoom and pitch the map, but to a much lesser degree than other games of similar scale, and it just so happens that the maximum zoom level seems to be only a dozen or so feet higher than the cruising altitude of your aircraft, which tend in any case to blot out the entire screen if you manage to get the camera right over them.  Selection of aircraft can thus be a serious challenge during large scale engagements, and there were times I was completely unable to locate my aircraft on-screen, despite tracking their pirouetting shadows on the ground below.  Increasing the zoom level would fix this, though the new 3D engine has some performance issues that probably account for Nival's unwillingness to pull back the camera further.   Reinforcements can be called a given number of times per mission depending upon the mission's difficulty and there's still a supply system for replenishing mines, defense materials, spare parts, and ammo.  While this hasn't changed much from the first game, it remains a welcome respite from ~gamey~ resource gathering and lets you instead focus on pure tactics, such as calling in bombers to pound a fortified position, assigning engineers to mine a defensive position, using scouting vehicles ahead of an assault force to avoid unnecessary losses in an ambush, or just augmenting your infantry and armor battalions.  As with most military operations, Blitzkrieg 2 is about succeeding with what you have at the outset, not rushing to max some arbitrary population cap before sending your Mongolian horde off to swarm some unlucky player's base.  It's difficult to convey just how nice it is to play an RTS that's managed to foil silly RTS shortcomings like the dreaded ever-irksome tank rush.    Visually the game has been completely overhauled and now looks much better in terms of what it's attempting to model.  Tank explosions and bomber drops in particular rock the house in terms of lighting and particle effects, and many of the benefits of a full 3D engine have been implemented to improve ballistic fidelity, such as realistic line-of-sight between objects, which makes forest sniping from beyond the ~fog-of-war~ radius a special pleasure, unless you're on the receiving end in which case using scouting or spotting units effectively is key.  Battlefield topography has also been significantly retouched, allowing terrain nuances the previous game was incapable of.  Tanks will now topple trees and level houses, vehicle tracks can be broken or thrown, hulking wrecks will litter the battlefield and block unit access, and roads, rivers, fields, and bridges all have richer physics supporting their underlying impact on combat.  Beauty has its price, and this one is no exception.  Despite its deceptively low system requirements, Blitzkrieg 2 is a ravenous little monster, drawing even a system with an Nvidia 7800GTX card into the frame-rate teens when air and ground combat is occurring simultaneously.  The game looks good, but not good enough to warrant the performance hit, especially with better looking games on the market that run without these performance hiccups.    Multiplayer has been revamped to include a ladder system and allows up to eight players to butt heads in either regular or ranked games.  As in the solo game, you can play as the U.S., Germany, or Soviet Union at one of four technology levels, and players that join on the same side are automatically allied once the game begins.  The reinforcement system works similar to the single-player game, and each player has a supply depot in their corner of the map that serves as their reinforcement hub.  Interestingly, there is no reinforcement limit in multiplayer mode, though there is a stringent time limit imposed between reinforcement requests.  This makes for rather awe-inspiring skirmishes if you have several defensive players that like to castle-up.  Even here, blindly bombarding your opponents is a sure way to lose if your opponents are practicing appropriate defensive combined arms tactics.   As an aside, I have a minor quibble with the manual.  A relatively simple RTS like Warcraft III gets a 150+ page manual detailing among other things all units in the game, while a complex RTS like Blitzkrieg 2 gets less than half that page count and expects you to plug the in-game encyclopedia if you're looking for more than broad overviews of gameplay concepts.  And while the localization is better this time around, there's still an unacceptable number of typos in the game itself (the manual, to its credit, is free of these).The only thing more repetitive than World War II as perhaps the quintessential gaming oeuvre is a journalist that can't stop complaining about it, so I'll surrender now and acknowledge Blitzkrieg 2 as one of those unanticipated anomalies I wasn't expecting to be this good.  Looking at wargame market share, it's not exactly roses and puppy dogs these days, with gamers craving quicker fixes and less mental gymnastics.  Blitzkrieg 2 isn't so much an act of defiance as an attempt to bridge the divide.  Most games that try to do this end of up being lackluster in both areas, but not this one.Personally -- and this is going to land me in hot water with my grognard friends -- I think the future of wargaming hinges on precisely this sort of gradual shift away from the artificial, unrealistic sterility of the turn-based paradigm.  Ask any military commander when the last time was they radioed the opposition and said ~It's your turn now, go ahead!~  The trick, of course, is getting the real-time interface to match the scale of the wargame, something that I think Blitzkrieg 2 does admirably.  Sure, it has a few blemishes, like an air control system that's a pain in the backside to manage and the usual pathfinding suspects, but the overall experience of deploying hundreds of different units, then winning or losing on the merits of tactical cleverness alone, is sure to put a smile on even the most jaded turn-based aficionado's grumpy mug.", "date": "Oct 3, 2005"}
