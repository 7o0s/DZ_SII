Taking many cues from the Nintendo classic Duck Hunt, you are put in the role of a hunter on the prowl for fowl.  With all of the hunting games out there, though, does MacPlay score a hit with this entry?Gameplay in Birdie Shoot is about as simple as it gets.  Move the sights with the mouse, click to shoot, and reload with the spacebar.  A variety of birds, along with other special items such as airplanes and UFOs, will stream across the screen into your domain.  There are a handful of levels to play through which will impact the game through scenery changes.  For instance, in forested areas the birds will fly behind trees.  The game isnt especially deep, but it definitely excels in its ability to be picked up and played immediately.  Within a few clicks youll be transported from your desktop to the great outdoors to test your aim.  One interesting addition to the hunting environments is the ability to pan through the scenery.  By placing your cursor flush against the right or left side of the screen, your view will move in that direction.  This allows you to catch up with birds or find a spot with a clear view.  Aside from this addition, though, the gameplay appears similar to other titles in the genre.The graphics in Birdie Shoot are a departure from recent games such as Deer Hunter.  Instead of the realistic visuals, it favors a cartoonish approach that works well.  It allows the artists to make the various types of birds look more distinct.  The graphics  won't blow you away, but they are effective and require modest hardware to run well.Sound is obviously not a crucial element to the game, but what is there is solid.  There is no background music, but the environmental sounds give it an appropriately feel for the cartoony outdoor setting.  The sound effects for actually firing the gun are also just fine.  The sound  won't really draw your attention, and thats just fine, because that means it isnt doing anything poorly.Birdie Shoot is one of MacPlays Value Series games that retail for just under $20.  For those of you who love any and all hunting games or enjoy them but havent yet purchased one, this is a worthy addition to your collection.  The Mac OS X compatibility will attrract many gamers as well.  But, for those of you who already own a hunting game, there is probably not enough difference here to warrant another purchase.  Its a quality product overall, its just not breaking much new ground.", "date": "Jul 9, 2002"}
