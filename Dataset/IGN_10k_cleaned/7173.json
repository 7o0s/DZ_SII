{"name": "Safecracker: The Ultimate Puzzle Adventure", "name_review": "Safecracker Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/08/30/safecracker-review", "text": "For gamers out there who can't turn down a good puzzle, it's worth taking a look at Kheops Studio's Safecracker. It's an extremely straightforward puzzle-adventure game, so those who require lush story or sprawling environments may want to stay clear. Despite its minimalistic presentation, it's got some good puzzles. Safecracker doesn't pad itself with unnecessary gimmicks designed to prolong gameplay hours. Its puzzles are varied, challenging and satisfying to conquer for the most part. Beyond that there isn't much, but for pure puzzle crunching entertainment, Safecracker is a good choice.   The game's limited storyline takes place entirely within the Miami-based mansion of recently deceased safe fanatic Duncan Walter Adams. It seems the man struck it rich before retiring to his abode during his final days. After he passed into the afterlife, his relatives were distressed to learn he'd hidden his will in his house, trapped behind an intricate series of interlocking puzzle structures. They hire you, a safe specialist, to investigate the residence and recover the will.    Starting in the foyer of the late Adams' house, you're put up against the first puzzle right away. Though the puzzles prove progressively more difficult, there's little challenge to learning the game controls. Safecracker is a point and click affair. You move yourself around between predetermined positions by left clicking the mouse. Right clicking brings up your inventory, letting you pick up keys to open doors and check clues. Clicking puzzle areas brings you to a close up of the device so you can poke at its more intricate parts. Generally the only things in the house that can be interacted with are the actual puzzles. There's no need in Safecracker to hunt around searching for a hidden item under a planter or above a fridge. In fact, we only found one puzzle much later in the game that required any sort of environmental scrutinizing outside the close-up puzzle screen. All the key items necessary to solve puzzles are locked within the safes. This way, when you open a safe and clean it out, you can be sure you've got all the items you're supposed to.   Strewn about the house are a few sheets of paper; usually letters from family members or diary pages that help fill in miniscule pieces of the threadbare storyline. They're not used in solving the puzzles, so it doesn't matter if you pass by without reading. As for the actual puzzles, they're tough, but make sense after a while. For the most part, all the necessary information is either in your inventory or visible somewhere on the puzzle screen. When no tools are required, solving the challenge is sometimes a matter of trial and error. For some, like a broken lock puzzle in the Workshop, you might want to bust out a pen and paper to take some notes. Others, like the Polybius square-type puzzles, chromatic laser safe, and Sudoku-type challenges keep things entertaining by balancing entertainment value and time required to pierce the rind of challenge and reach the meaty core of success. Eventually they all make sense. I know I slapped my forehead a few times after realizing what I'd missed.    While they can all be solved with patience, a keen eye, and an open mind, one or two of them seem unnecessarily obscure. The colored wires in a keypad and snooker table puzzles come to mind. Aside from that, there are few annoyances to impede gamers' progress toward the game's underwhelming finale. Mostly that's because there's so little in the game aside from the puzzles. The Adams residence has two main floors, a small basement area and loft section. Never do players get to roam outside or do any exploration aside from what's critical to progression. Graphics are easy on the eyes, but don't really animate unless you're moving around a puzzle. Lighted computer screens and water in a fountain are a few exceptions. The game provides no options for altering resolution or other graphical tweaks, so players are stuck with the default. Despite the simple graphics, we still noticed some flickering and aberrations.   In terms of sound, the game offers a few clips to entertain your ears. An electronic ambient melody plays during your travels through Adams' house, there are a few voice clips, and a few sounds associated with manipulating puzzles. Other than that, there isn't much.It's a good thing Safecracker has a number of entertaining puzzles, because it has little else. The graphics are decent, though confined entirely to the Adams residence.  Sounds are limited to a repeating ambient track and a few snippets of voice acting, and the plot won't capture anyone's imagination. Despite the lack of presentation, the puzzles and challenges are varied, require patience and contemplation, and are fun to solve. For adventure fans who love puzzles, or anyone looking to prick their brain in new ways, Safecracker is a good choice. It's a short game, it took us around six hours to beat, but it manages to remain entertaining by providing engaging puzzles instead of illogical challenges.", "date": "Aug 30, 2006"}
