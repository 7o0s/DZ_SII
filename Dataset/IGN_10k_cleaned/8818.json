As some of the Big N's top franchise ready for release gamers are finally starting to see an onslaught of solid presentation, true Wii-esque graphics, and innovative, immersive control.  Still, the system isn't without its lesser additions, and while games like SEGA's Alien Syndrome show an obvious effort on the console, they'll quickly pale in comparison to some of the second generation Wii projects gamers are already getting excited for, and show the true difference between top-tier games and lesser efforts.  Alien Syndrome attempts to revitalize a classic franchise and bring innovative IR control to a newly-designed ~Shooter RPG~ system, and while some of the mechanics work, the final product still feels all too freshman from top to bottom.   You've undoubtedly seen coverage of Alien Syndrome on our site, as the developer has posted blogs, provided us with hands-on builds, and shared a ton of info on the game, but for those late to the party Alien Syndrome can still be summed up fairly simply.  Take one part Smash TV and mix it with the isometric view and RPG system of something like Diablo and you've got Syndrome's offering pretty much down.  Players can either trek through the game in single player mode, or opt to have up to four players engage in co-operative multiplayer throughout the entire adventure, and in that aspect Alien Syndrome is a solid offering.      Selecting from one of five different ~classes~ will start each player with their own custom stats and proficiencies, and as the game progresses both increase in stride.  Along the way you'll have full access to a mobile turret/weapon shop known as the SCARAB, which can provide everything from new weaponry or armor to simple necessities like additional ammo for specific guns or health packs.  If at any time you find yourself carrying too much weight or in need of extra cash, just ~scrap~ items and your SCARAB unit will turn them into more currency.  This ~on the fly upgrade~ system is a huge high point of Alien Syndrome, and it ensures that the game offers non-stop action while still having the depth of a classic town-based action-RPG.  Once you take to the battlefield it's all about blasting baddies with your Wii IR control, beating them down with a wide array of Wii-mote motions for heavy attacks, stabs, circular clear-all sweeps, smashes, and finishing maneuvers.  Each motion works well, but suffers from slow overall melee combo linking, so you'll feel an odd lag in the attacks until you up your character's actual hand-to-hand speed proficiency.   For the most part the general combat works fine, and players who are craving a more in-depth four player experience may take some joy out of working together and beating the ever-loving-tar out of a few space mutants.  In the end, however, you're going to find that for every entertaining concept or option in Alien Syndrome there's one or two annoying ones in its place.  For starters, the game's visual presentation is - if at all - a small step above its PSP counterpart.  It's obvious this one was designed for PSP, and then ~re-designed~ along the way for Wii implementation.  The motions and IR work great, but the visuals tell a story as well, as characters are about as low-poly and unimpressive as a top-tier PSX game or low-quality PS2 effort.   If you can get over the extremely weak graphical offering and bland, two-tone interface some of the odder gameplay issues will undoubtedly frustrate you.  For starters, the aforementioned melee lag makes using anything but firearms a serious trial of patience, as enemies close in on you and hack away while you wait for your player to attack, waggling the Wii-mote all the while.  The IR aiming works extremely well for this type of game, but factor in a few odd mobility choices and that too can be a pain at times.  When moving, the player will actually change running speed based on where your torso is pointing, so if you swing the remote behind your character, she'll slow down due to an awkward shot attempt.     That's fine, but what isn't forgivable is the full pause that happens when whipping the IR 180 degrees or more, actually stopping your character whenever you move the cursor around her body.  Unlike previous shooters like Smash TV or Total Carnage, free 360 degree aiming can take a toll on mobility; part of it is by design, but the frequent ~pauses~ the character makes when simply moving the IR about is certainly an overlooked gameplay issue, and it makes simply getting around in Alien Syndrome a bit of a chore.   Along those same lines, camera control is somewhat unreliable, assigned to the nunchuk controller's left and right tilt similar to Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.  Engaging the turn can be a bit sketchy, and it often requires you to turn your left hand 90 degrees to get it to work; not exactly quick and intuitive.  There's a control option in the game's interface, but unfortunately it only changes which button (A or B) is used for primary/secondary fire, and doesn't allow you to map camera movement or item usage to different areas.Anyone who can get past the more annoying nuances of the games design and execution, however, may still find some fun in Alien Syndrome.  The game offers over 100 different enemies, but rehashes some of its more minor bosses in an attempt to add longevity.  At the same time, powering up your character is relatively deep for a simple run-n-gun game, and we got some simple enjoyment out of powering up our weaponry or making use of class-specific skills such as increased critical rates or outstanding melee power.  If this game would have been on Wii during release at a $29.99 price tag (or $39.99 at the most) we might have endorsed it a bit more, but seeing as its release couples a $50 price point with a pre-fall shelf date (the Wii software rush is coming) its hard for us to get too excited about Alien Syndrome.  For fans of classic action-RPGs or multiplayer addicts Alien Syndrome would be a solid weekend rental or bargain bin purchase, but given the lack of polish throughout, the overall PSP-ness of the games graphical presentation, and the $50 price tag weve got to put SEGAs latest Wii effort in the just skip it category.  There are far better games on Wiis horizon.", "date": "Jul 26, 2007"}
