{"name": "X-Men Legends 2", "name_review": "X-Men Legends II", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/14/x-men-legends-ii", "text": "Activision released X-Men Legends II for consoles earlier this season to a solid amount of fanfare, and now MFORMA is following up on the momentum with a pocket-sized companion. X-Men Legends II is only a mobile sequel in theory, as there was no actual X-Men Legends for your handset. Unlike the console game, which is a top-down action-RPG, X-Men Legends II for cellphones is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up with some solid RPG trimmings. It was a wise design choice, as after playing X-Men Legends II on the Xbox, I doubt the formula would have made a competent mobile game.   Beat-'em-ups are such temperamental games -- there's a sweet spot that you either hit or you don't. If one element if off -- control, enemy frequency, available moves -- the whole things come crashing down like a house built on the side of a dirt hill. Fortunately, X-Men Legends II seems to have its proverbial ducks situated in the correct proverbial row. The controls are simple enough that some of the more elaborate moves (which are unlocked through a purchase system -- but we'll get to that in a sec) are still fairly easy to pull off. And there is certainly no shortage of bugaboos to smack around, but you never get overwhelmed to the point you wanna flip the clamshell up and search out the ~unsubscribe~ button.   In X-Men Legends II, you control a duo of X-Men or Brotherhood characters. The conceit of the storyline has both the X-Men and the bad mutants under Magneto's charge teaming up to battle Apocalypse, a fearsome foe that could wipe out both of them. There are five mutants to choose from; Wolverine, Cyclops, Magneto, Juggernaught, and Storm. Each mutant has their own individual powers. You begin the game with a basic attack, such as Wolverine's claws, but more can be purchased as you defeat enemies.   This is where X-Men Legends II's RPG stuff comes into play. Experience points, collected by smashing enemies, gives way to gaining levels. With experience, you can upgrade move sets and unlock some high-powered slaps. This system is a little on the ~lite~ side, but that's likely best for a mobile game, which benefits from capturing the essence of console game functionality, rather than a complete recreation. Diving five screens deep into customization on an LG VX7000 doesn't smack of a good time to the likes of me, at least. Maybe you enjoy hours of squinting.   Not that you'll need to squint during the battles and bruisings. The playfield takes up the majority of the screen, and the character sprites are of a good size. Each character is nicely proportioned and detailed, with different attack animations. There are multiple ~planes~ you must duke it out with enemies on, so count on much up and down movement, as well as side to side. (Hey now.)   During my play session, I settled in with Wolverine and Magneto. (Sorry, Halle Berry has just sorta soured me on Storm.) They are a good compliment to each other, as Wolverine deals with melee attacks and Magneto uses his, well, magnetism to force enemies into submission. You can try all sorts of combinations with X-Men Legends II, which gives the game a solid amount of replay value. Maybe next time I'll try Cyclops and Juggernaught. Or Cyclops and Wolverine. The world is my oyster like that.  X-Men Legends II is a brawler with good depth. The ability to pick from five different characters with individual move sets (but with commands that aren't wildly different that you cannot memorize combos), and the action is enjoyable enough that you may want to play through it a second time with unused mutants/ I like that the RPG trimmings from the console edition are present, but not overwhelming; you power up some stats and moves, but there's no worry of custom changes or item-equipping. If you like the X-Men or stomping monsters -- and I bet these two audiences have some serious overlap -- then X-Men Legends II is a needed download.", "date": "Nov 14, 2005"}
