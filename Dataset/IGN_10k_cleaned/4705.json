This week, Spider-Man 2 Pinball launched, and we immediately downloaded it. Question is now, should you?   Features:   Two-screen table  Alfred Molina!   Sony's Spider-Man 2 Pinball, sorry to say, is not the world's best pinball game to go. Which is a shame, because the license is hot and the game itself looks fantastic -- especially that sweet pic of Alfred Molina on the top half of the table.   But looks mean little when it comes to pinball -- these games live or die by their physics models, and that's where the webslinger runs out of juice. You see, at few points during the game will you ever feel like the ball went exactly where you wanted it to. And it's not just on your first or second game, but the tenth and eleventh, when you should have a good feel for the board.   Instead, the ball just kinda blasts up the screen, maybe hits a few targets, then plummets back down. Rarely are you able to send the ball into the top half of the screen. Not only because the haphazard physics, but also because the space between the top set of flippers -- essentially the gateway to the top half -- is too small to negotiate with said physics.   All this is a pity, because like we said, the game looks great. The board is all spiders -- from Space Invader-ish arachnids that crawl across the lower half, to the big, colorful grab of Spider-Man himself beneath the table. While we haven't seen the movie yet, we suspect it will be loud. Spider-Man 2 Pinball, however, is not.Spider-Man 2 Pinball is a step above some of the worse movie tie-in vids we've played on our handsets. But those goofy physics just torpedo the game. You smack the ball and it advances up the screen in what feels like pre-ordained patterns. No fun. If you're looking for a good pinballer, we recommend Ren & Stimpy Pinball or Pinball Dragon.", "date": "May 17, 2004"}
