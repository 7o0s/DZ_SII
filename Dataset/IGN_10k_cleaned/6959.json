As the title suggests, Armored Fury puts an emphasis on tank combat but that doesn't mean that there's not plenty of fun to be had by grunts and flyboys. Armored Fury isn't quite as massive a pack as last year's Special Forces but its new maps and new vehicles (not to mention its ten-dollar price tag) make it a very attractive proposition for Battlefield 2 players.  The new booster pack finally brings the fight to the United States. After fighting in far-flung lands, the US Marine Corps find themselves defending America from a two-pronged attack. The Chinese have landed in Alaska and are preparing to seize an important port complete with its oil pipeline. Meanwhile, the MEC have landed on the East Coast where they're struggling to gain control of the rivers and highways that will lead them to Washington, DC.   There are three new maps here, each of which depicts a unique area in the conflict. While it would have been nice to see fights taking place in familiar locations like San Francisco or Washington, DC, the maps in the booster pack make for some intense fighting in familiar surroundings.  In Operation Midnight Sun, players take part in a nighttime invasion of an Alaskan port. The Chinese have established a beachhead at Valdez and are now pushing inland. After securing a nearby town, the Chinese have to push across a wide river to seize positions held by the US Marines. While planning their own assault across the river, the Marines will also have to consider how to defend the massive pipeline and oil refineries near their starting location.  Operation Harvest sees the MEC pushing through Pennsylvania Dutch country. The fight will rage across vast wheat fields, amid quaint farmhouses and silos and even a grain loading operation near a railroad line. Visually, it's the best level of the bunch, perfectly capturing the feeling that you're fighting for land that is undeniably American. As an added treat, there are some massive storm clouds overhead. Though it doesn't affect the gameplay, it adds tons to the flavor of the level.   Things are very intense in Operation Road Rage. Here the MEC and the USMC are fighting over a crucial highway that grants access to a number of important targets on the East Coast. The whole map is dominated by a massive cloverleaf intersection and a long stretch of highway. The flag in the middle is on an elevated section of highway making it very hard to sneak your way onto it. As long as the defender can defend in both directions, you're basically stuck with gaining the objective through sheer weight of numbers. Though that's the main objective, fighting is sure to spill over into a number of surrounding areas, from the crowded strip mall to a pleasant suburb development.   Over the last few days EA has been hosting matches for industry types. From our experience in those matches, these new maps are just as balanced and exciting as the existing ones. We had many back and forth matches where the winning side only had a handful of tickets left. There are bound to be small imbalances that appear once thousands and thousands of people start playing but, so far, the new maps seem very even.  Though Armored Fury is a tank-focused game, that doesn't mean that infantry can't be effective. Sure, they still can't go toe-to-toe with a T90, but with a little forethought and a little caution, there's no reason an infantry soldier can't stay alive long enough to make a difference on the battlefield. The designers have made it easy on the poor infantry by providing lots and lots of cover at each flag point.      The various buildings, fences, trees and such make parking your tank near a flag a very risky proposition. Troops armed with AT rockets and C4 packs have a number of places to hide in these maps, so the second you hear that little lock alarm go off, you're probably better off just bailing and looking for the enemy on foot. Some of the more open areas, like the strip mall entrance in Road Rage or the wheat fields in Harvest, definitely give tankers a little more security, but also put them at risk for aerial attack.  Getting stuck between buildings and silos and such can provide a little more protection from the planes flying overhead and there are even a few areas where creative players can actually hide from aerial attack. Parking under garages, awnings and so forth won't necessarily save you from complete destruction if you're up against a persistent pilot, but it can definitely give you more of a fighting chance.   Unfortunately, the new booster pack includes three new ground-support jets that aren't balanced out by a similar increase in anti-air weapons. It's true that each map has vehicles and emplacements designed to ward off aerial attacks, and the slower speed of the jets gives you a greater chance of taking them down, but for the most part Armored Fury maintains the helpless feeling drivers get when they hear the whine of airplane engines.  It's not even as if the jets will be fighting each other. Nevermind the average BF2 pilots complete disregard of his counterpart on the other side (they'd far rather pick on the easier ground targets), the three new jets' weapons and slower speed make them ideal for tank-busting. Ironically, the cramped areas that protect tanks from attack also make it a little more difficult for you to get your vehicle-mounted anti-air weapons ready in time to take out a passing plane.  There are also three new scout choppers in the game, one for each of the combatants. Each one is equipped with pilot-fired cannons but the choppers are far too weak and fragile to serve as effective combat vehicles. Instead, they tend to serve as rapid transport vehicles, getting their passengers in and out of combat before the enemy has a chance to react. Each chopper is also equipped with a small radar that can give the commander important information about nearby enemies.   The recent 1.3 patch (required to play the booster pack) includes cooperative play. While it's nice to be able to play with friends against computer-controlled bots, the AI just doesn't put up enough of a challenge. This makes cooperative play an attractive alternative for newcomers who can't quite seem to keep up on the multiplayer-only servers or for a team of coordinated veterans who want to be sure of an easy win.Three new maps, three new jets and three new helicopters isn't a lot of new content. We'd love to have seen a wider variety of maps, some new ground vehicles and maybe even a new kit. Still, the strength of the maps alone is enough to make this booster pack a sure thing for more Battlefield 2 players. The new planes still aren't balanced but this isn't anything that veteran Battlefield 2 players haven't already put up with.While expansion packs and boosters are designed to increase the enjoyment of a game among existing fans, the new cooperative mode might just bring a few new players into the fold. By presenting a slightly less intense version of the game, the cooperative mode makes it easier for less experienced players to jump in and see what all the fuss is about.At ten bucks, you can hardly complain.", "date": "Jun 5, 2006"}
