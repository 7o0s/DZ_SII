The game received quite a bit of attention due to its spectacular graphic effects, as it was one of the first Xbox games to really show off what the system was capable of. Wreckless also featured plenty of destructive driving through a large city filled with tons of pedestrians, traffic, and random objects to smash through, and now it's finally being brought to PlayStation 2.   Though the game is minus most of the graphical ~Wow~ factor that made the Xbox version so popular, the game has plenty of new additions to keep it from feeling like a cheap port. This new version adds many extra cars to unlock, ranging from a cab to a chicken truck. There are also plenty of cheats, bonus missions, and a multiplayer mode.   Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions allows you to take on the role of either a couple of spies or an elite police unit known as the Dragons. Both groups are after the Yakuza, who seem to always be causing some sort of trouble in town. The basic idea is to drive around a nicely populated town, stop the Yakuza from causing more havoc, and have a little fun running stuff over on the side.   Gameplay  Wreckless is broken up into two story sections, one where you follow two spies, and the other where you follow the Dragons. Each story set has 10 standard missions and 10 bonus missions. Most standard missions usually have the same sort of objective, where the idea is to destroy a group of Yakuza cars or defend something from them. Some other missions include finding a set of bombs in a limited amount of time, or taking photographs for evidence. Each mission has an easy and hard difficulty setting, and it also has a certain goal to complete to obtain a medal. Simply finishing the mission will get you a bronze, but finishing the mission faster, for example, will earn you silver or gold.   The main focus in Wreckess is destruction. Sure, it's a driving game, but the point of driving is so that you can tear the city apart. Well, you're actually only supposed to be taking out the Yakuza, but the game is fun because of the amount of chaotic destruction that you'll cause as you chase the Yakuza cars down. The city is littered with plenty of random stuff and pedestrians to hit during missions. Yes, the new version allows you to actually hit pedestrians, something that the Xbox version didn't allow. Hitting them isn't all that violent though; they just sort of bounce off your hood if you can manage to nail them.   Along with the citizens who are enjoying a nice day in the sun or just going for a stroll, the city is replete with fences, tables and chairs, trees, benches and tons of other stuff to run over, not to mention the pretty dense traffic. Driving down the sidewalk will cause all sorts of things to start flying off the hood of your car, and that's where this game is fun. The basic act of running anything and everything over while causing as much of a mess as possible is good fun. Although this version lacks the Xbox's neat visual effects, there are just as many objects littering the city, so don't worry about not having anything to smash into.   The game uses the standard steering, gas, brake and handbrake controls of practically every driving game in existence. You also have an adrenaline boost available that will slow down time enough to dodge through traffic. The control is generally tight, although the cars feel much different than most driving games. Most of the cars don't feel like they have a realistic amount of weight to them, so it feels a bit weird at first. As light as they feel, they don't wreck in the manner that you'd assume. You'll mostly come to a complete stop when you hit the side of a building, rather than go spinning down the street like it would seem you should. It makes the crashing a little more forgiving in this way, though, for better or for worse. The center of gravity also seems a bit odd, since your car will teeter up a bit around practically every turn. You'll get used to the physics pretty fast, but they do feel odd at first.   Once you get used to the physics, the cars handle pretty well and act responsively. The turning radius for most cars is pretty tight even at high speeds, so careening from alley to alley is pretty easy. Acceleration is pretty quick on most of the cars, which is nice since you'll be running into stuff constantly. The one thing that's a little odd is the top speed of even the fastest sports cars. They'll top out at about 90 mph normally, though you can get them up to around 120 mph or so with one of the unlockable cheats. It would be nice to be able to hit closer to 140 mph or more with the fastest cars, since this would make the game even more chaotic and fun.   One new feature is that cars can now fire rockets to take down the Yakuza. The rockets are a cool addition, although they don't make much sense on many of the cars. It's a little odd to see a buggy fire a missile out of its grill, but hey, it's a videogame. The rockets aren't as powerful as you might assume though, which would have thrown off the balance of the game. They're most useful when catching up to a car to smash it, rather than just hanging back and pelting it with missiles. They do a bit of damage, but your supply is limited and they aren't powerful enough to make them a prime source of destruction.   Another new feature that wasn't in the Xbox version is the inclusion of bonus missions. By completing a standard mission on the hard difficulty, you'll unlock its bonus mission. The bonus missions are generally a little different than the regular missions. They range from having to destroy a bunch of Yakuza cars in an arena to searching the town for hidden objects within a certain time limit. Some of the bonus missions are of the same sort as the regular missions, like having to protect a van, but it's nice to see some of the more off-the-wall objectives.   The bonus missions can unlock a large set of cheats, with a total of 20 cheats that may be unlocked. Every time you obtain a Gold on one of the bonus missions, a new cheat will be available. The cheat list is available from the start, so you'll be able to see which bonuses you'll need to complete in order to obtain certain cheats. Some of the cheats include a high and low friction setting, high and low gravity, no traffic, super steering, and unlimited time.    The problem with the cheats is that it brings up a matter of the game becoming highly unbalanced if you choose to use them. Cheating is, of course, either supposed to make things easier, or sometimes just cause odd and interesting effects, though you usually don't unlock any good cheats until you've finished the game at least once. The problem here though is that unlocking one of the better cheats is pretty quick and easy, and once you have one decent cheat, obtaining more becomes easier and easier. Once you have a few in your arsenal, almost every mission in the game becomes a joke. Of course, there are things called restraint and self-control, and if you can muster the strength to use them, none of this is really a problem.   While it's entertaining to destroy the city for a while, the fun wears off fairly fast. Even though the missions have different objectives, they're all mostly based on destroying cars or getting to objects as fast as possible. After you've destroyed the Yakuza cars for the fifth time, and gotten tired of collecting bombs or whichever icon represents checkpoints at any given time, you'll realize that there isn't much to this game at all. It's a simple drive and mash game, without a whole lot of skill or depth involved. There are a fair bit of missions, but the game won't take too long to play through. There's a decent amount of stuff to unlock, but most of the extra vehicles aren't any more fun to drive than the standard cars.   The game includes a 2-player mode, but it's a huge waste of time, and only entertaining to laugh at. There's a decent selection of game types, so on the box the multiplayer mode might look nice, but the 2-player mode isn't played in split-screen. That's right, both cars are driving from one viewpoint. If one player gets far enough away from the other, then both cars are reset and you begin racing again. The mode can also be entirely unfair since you keep restarting. For example, when playing the mode where one player is out to destroy the other, the victim car always starts ahead of the attacking car. If the attacking car is faster and has better acceleration, it'll hit the victim car every time off the start, and there's no way to get away. If the victim car actually manages to dodge it and get away, it just resets you anyway. All of the modes play out in this sort of fashion, so they're all hardly worth plugging in a second controller to even check out.   Graphics  First things first: this game does not look anywhere near as good as the Xbox version. The Xbox version was filled to the brim with tons of effects and eye candy, of which almost none carried over to this version. That's not to say that the game looks terribly bad, but don't expect a miracle.   The graphics in Wreckless are decent, if you take into consideration everything that's going on. From a simple screenshot, the game looks a little bland. Many other driving games are miles ahead in a purely visual manner, but where Wreckless shines is in the shear amount of stuff that populates the city. As mentioned before, the city is filled to the brim with pedestrians, random objects and traffic. The city is fairly large, there's nary a bit of popup, and the framerate is generally rock solid.   The cars all look decent, but not great by any means. They'll shine a bit as you drive around, but they lack all the pizzazz that made the original version look so nice. The city is reasonably well designed, and it's pretty large to boot. There are distinctly styled areas that you can drive through, and there are plenty of areas for jumping and crashing through tons of stuff.   Sound  The sound in Wreckless is pretty good for the most part. Crashing through stuff provides a vast assortment of breaking sounds, and smashing into cars comes with some decent metal-on-metal sounds. When you're piling through metal barrier after metal barrier, the dings that they emit when bashing off the hood of your car sounds pretty much right on. That's not to say that the game has the most realistic sound effects ever, but they fit the game's overblown style just right.  Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions can be a relatively fun game for a little while, if solely based on the fact that a good time is always had by breaking tons of stuff. The fun wears off pretty soon though, and you'll soon realize that this game is as deep at a kiddy pool. The missions are all varied types of the same couple of themes, so they just feel like a new coat of paint on the same old car.The game also has a few questionable features, like the jokingly bad multiplayer mode. Wreckless might provide a short bit of mindless crashing fun for a bit, but it gets boring and repetitive pretty quick.", "date": "Nov 12, 2002"}
