The year was 1993, and the industry was walking on eggshells as September approached; September, the scheduled release month for Mortal Kombat. The fighter was a sensationalized spectacle of violence, going over the top in its realistic graphical depictions of gore and blood. It had gained a following in arcades since the previous year, and both SEGA and Nintendo knew that its homecoming to consoles meant big sales and a big outcry. Nintendo consented only to allow a censored version on the SNES. SEGA, though, let the blood fly freely.   The Genesis' defense was simple -- not all games are violent. SEGA let its version of Mortal Kombat keep its signature gore, trusting that any outrage could be diffused by pointing to other games in the catalog. Games like Ecco the Dolphin. Strategically released less than two months before Mortal Monday, Ecco was in place to be SEGA's non-violent, kid-friendly poster child when the time of tension hit its peak.           Ironically, Ecco's only friendly on the surface. Diving deeper into the title, players found a dark and remarkably difficult game design. The title is a side-scrolling swimmer, players placed in the role of a porpoise separated from his pod by a sudden, brutal storm. Finding, rescuing and reuniting the group of dolphins is Ecco's goal, and achieving it means exploration.   Stages in Ecco the Dolphin are large and open, and navigating through them is a much different play experience than other side-scrollers. This is owed to Ecco's unique style of free movement, swimming horizontally, vertically and diagonally without any platform jumping in sight. Ecco controls fluidly, the feel of commanding a dolphin in water far different from that of a running hedgehog or jumping plumber. He can charge forward at high speed to attack enemies. He can swim quickly and leap from the water to clear barriers of land. And he can use sonar waves to communicate with friendly characters, call up a map of his surroundings and, later in the game, befuddle his foes.   Ecco's adventure is simply searching the sea floor at first, but quickly gets more complicated. The plot is off-putting and more than slightly ridiculous, calling for Ecco to use a time machine developed by the lost civilization of Atlantis to travel to the past and stop aliens from harvesting food (his pod pals) from Earth's oceans. You'd think that by 1993 the storylines in games would have started making more sense. And you'd be wrong.Playing Ecco now, 13 years later, is still enjoyable... it's just not remarkable. The game inspired several ports, spin-offs and sequels, but hasn't gone down as a true classic. It's a notable, interesting and challenging release, but it shouldn't take your money before other, worthier choices. Ecco helped diffuse a time of tension, but that time's long since past. This porpoise has served his purpose, and can be safely passed.", "date": "Dec 13, 2006"}
