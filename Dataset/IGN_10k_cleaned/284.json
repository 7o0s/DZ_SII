There's nothing we like more here in the IGNPC offices than motorcycles. Or chaps.  I can't tell you how much a tassel-emblazoned faux-leather package and a hint at petrol-induced rabble-rousing can get me excited about a game. If Homeworld would have just had some tassles on the side of the box, or at the very least been on fire, I would have instantly have given it a ten, quit my job, and begun selling Amway the very next day. After receiving the box in question last week, I had been watching it sitting there on my desk intently, working on other projects while staring at its boxy features in the hopes of getting a grasp on either the fullness of America or the majesty of Harley Davidson. I felt a little hungry. I took this to mean interest. I'm a little wary about any game that comes with a paper casing for the CD-ROM, but I figured that Wizard Works was just cutting the necessary corners in order to provide we, the consumers, with the best possible gaming experience at the lowest price.   The first thing -- and this may be the killer -- you've got to deal with is the configuration screen, which is confusing enough to thwart most casual (AKA budget) gamers with its lists, menu systems, and options. Make sure you know the difference between emulation and 3D acceleration, and you should be fine. Then, it's time for the rock! Guitar swells over midi-packed drums like a musical version of Pabst Blue Ribbon, and a simple menu screen readies you for your new digital life as the antithesis of Touched by an Angel -- groped by a biker.   You can do a practice race on a selection of courses, or do a country tour which gives you a chance to race across the United States to your mecca and mine, Sturgis. You've got a selection of bikes to choose from, as well as a few brands of human to give yourself the persona of -- I chose ~big biker with tattoos and leather Harley jacket #5,~ and thought he'd want a hot pink bike. Since he is trying to win a race, what better way to motivate slick driving skills than by having mobs of Harley Davidson bikers chasing him and shouting angrily? Once you've chosen your bike you can select your set of courses to race over -- though there are nine courses total to choose from, tour mode separates them into groups of three, with the final race being Sturgis. As you progress through the game, you'll be able to see states like Arizona, Colorado, Utah, California, Wisconsin and South Dakota on your trip, and pass some of the more minor landmarks on the way. Anyone ready for the Corn Palace? We thought so. Beat races, and you'll be able to use your prize money to purchase upgrades for your bikes, bringing up the top speed, acceleration, and fuel economy levels to Easy Rider levels.  Graphically the game floats somewhere between the Extreme series and the newest Deer Hunter game. The textures are fairly nice, and the environments are sparse but clean -- definitely enough to make you feel solid about cruising across the countryside. Unfortunately, most of the landmarks that you see promoted in the selection screens never appear in the game itself. I can understand not wanting to render Mt. Rushmore, but if you've got a picture of covered bridges in New England, shouldn't you feel a little tinge of guilt about not putting them in the level itself? Besides, I know my bikers, and my bikers love themselves some covered bridgin'.  Harleys in the game, it seem, guzzle gas like water. Unless you have a souped-up bike with some carb upgrades, you'll have to stop at every gas station along the way, or else you'll find yourself puttering down the highway on a glorified ten-speed. It begins to feel like a real road trip after a while -- cruise down the highway, stop for gas. Highway, gas. Highway. Gas. Each level begins to blend into the next, and while the countryside changes, the road structure or gameplay seldom does. You rarely get the impression that you're actually on a bike, and most of the time when you do, it's in a bad way. Where's the radio? I couldn't even put a Slurpee on one of these things, and besides, at least with a Geo Metro I could drive for over five minutes without having to stop for gas. Why can't I turn a corner without having to slam on my brakes? Where's the ~easy ride~ feel of Harleys, the cruise-ability that lets you lean through turns and take on the nastiest roads in America? Why can't I pick up hitchhikers and have them ride on the back while screaming out the lyrics to Kansas songs?   The designers love Harleys. They revere them. They love them so much that to show one of them breaking, or even falling would have been disrespectful. But no worries here -- the designers make sure that when you hit a truck at 120 mph, the bike will stop with a polite thunk against the nearest piece of metal. The same goes for gravel, which seems to flow like flypaper around America these days -- the minute, the very second your tire touches gravel, your driver immediately slows to crawl, and won't get up to any sort of high speed until you touch pavement once again. In real life, this would seem completely unrealistic, but once you've played a game with bikes that drive like trucks, it wasn't too hard to convince me that maybe these special lead bikes could hit a billboard at full speed and not even get a bent fender. Add to this the bizarre AI, and the game gets even messier. Feel free to blow by cops at 120mph -- they don't seem to mind these days, or at least they didn't in Colorado, but maybe that was just the high altitudes bubbling hydrogen into their brains. Sure, this is about cruising, about riding easy through America -- but I wanted my competitors to feel my exhaust as I laid hot tracks over by their sulking bodies. But no, they were much too busy in their own little worlds, entertaining themselves with the ~scenery~ and the ~love vibes~ of a country tour to try to cut me off, or at least curse when I snuck in behind them and gave them a taste of failure.  Fortunately, the sounds kept me satisfied where the morose AI and silky sheen brand of road construction did not. The great part about Harley Davidson: Race Across America is that it uses the real sounds of Harleys, peppering the thundering rumbles everywhere. The shuddering sound of tailpipes will be rolling around in your head by the time you've finished playing a game -- which shouldn't be that long, considering that an average race is only four tracks long. The 80's rock soundtrack made me very, very happy (I'd like to particularly thank budget titles in general for ~turnin' it up~ when the competition has gone all electronic -- keep on rocking, free world), especially how it slipped out when I exited from a game.   And yes, budget has gone multiplayer -- sort of. There's an opportunity to play other gamers over LAN or modem, but only through a hand-made server connection using IP addresses. Bikers, I've heard, like their gaming simple, and their online gaming even simpler -- for a multiplayer option to be used in the budget arena, it's got to be Half-Life or Tribes easy, or it won't get used.  No, this game isn't extreme. It isn't even dangerous. You may be riding a Harley, but you're playing the gaming version of Solitaire, revving through state after state of calm, serene scenery. With a standard racing backdrop to build from, Harley Davidson: Race Across America doesn't fall as hard as some of its brothers and sisters -- but it also refuses to excel. Bad game. Your job is to make me happy. I won't even get lazy on you and say ~if you like games of this genre, then you'll love...~ -- you won't love this one. I know you like Harleys. I know you go to Sturgis every year -- but until a good representation of your beer-ingesting, road-racing lifestyle is represented on the 3D accelerated screen, I would recommend that you turn down the sound on Powerslide and rock the roads with a little CCR.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Oct 4, 1999"}
