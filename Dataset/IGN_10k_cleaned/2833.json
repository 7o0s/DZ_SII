{"name": "Red Asphalt", "name_review": "Red Asphalt", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/01/15/red-asphalt-2", "text": "Most games can be divided into two basic categories: those that innovate, and those that follow. Psygnosis' Wipeout is a perfect example of a game that innovates. Although it's a racer, it's taken that genre and blown it wide open, making it into something new. Red Asphalt, Interplay's new title, is also a racer, but is complacent to exist in the second category.  As the involved backstory illustrates, Red Asphalt takes place in a future where aliens have invaded earth. Drivers of differing species are forced to compete in violent death match races, where weapons play as much a part of the contest as driving. The races take place across numerous planets (well, three actually) with six ground-based vehicles jostling for first place at any given time. If it sounds like Wipeout, you're not far off. In fact, Red Asphalt is so much like Wipeout (minus the hovering cars) it's not really funny.  Unlike Wipeout, each car has built in weapons. Your ground racer is equipped      with guns and mines to take out your      opponents, and kills count towards your total      points. Finish the races in the lead, and you'll      win cash to upgrade your vehicle, adding things like better weapons and tougher armor.  All of this is well and good, but how does it play? Well, this is the part that isn't like Wipeout: it isn't very much fun. The control of the vehicles is a little testy, especially in the cheaper suspensions, and often results in your car spinning out for the mere fact that you took your finger off the acceleration to go around a corner.  The graphics are pretty lack luster as well. While it's not ugly per se, it does have a rushed, sloppy look, with polygon clipping aplenty. When the car in front of you tends to blink on and off, you know you're in the presence of a rushed game. Add to this some unspectacular weapons effects, and you've got your self a pretty mediocre game.  Perhaps the most frustrating part of the game, though, is the interface. Never have I seen a more unnecessarily complex front end. The editors from the other sites gathered around to see if I could actually get the game to start, having been through this little Hellraiser cube puzzle the day before. Sorry to say, I had to ask for help just to get the game started. Come on!   With uninspired track design, limited graphics appeal, and an interface that would confuse Rubick himself, Red Asphalt leaves little to recommend it. Even when you're winning, it's boring.
