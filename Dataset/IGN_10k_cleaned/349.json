{"name": "Beauty and the Beast: Board Game", "name_review": "Beauty and the Beast", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/26/beauty-and-the-beast", "text": "Nintendo recently signed a deal with Disney that enables the company to produce a whole slew of products featuring Disney characters for the Game Boy. Beauty and the Beast is one of the first titles from this deal, and from start to finish (a quick trip), this game feels like a rush job to meet a quota. Features One to Four Players Eleven mini-games Battery save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Beauty and the Beast is the weaker, Disney little brother of the N64 game Mario Party. In Beauty and the Beast, you play a board game with 14 different squares -- four players take turns rolling dice, advancing on the board. Land on one of the ten mini-game spots, and your challenge is to beat the game. When you do, you're awarded extra spaces to advance on your next roll of the die. Each mini game also has a bonus star or two -- collect three of these and you advance onto a bonus mini-game (a spitting contest featuring Gaston). The first person to get to the finish space on the board wins the game.  If you have multiple human players in the game you'll have to pass the system from one person to the next -- the game, for some reason, doesn't feature link cable support. In the standard game, you can set yourself up against computer AI opponents, but you never see them play the mini-games to keep the game moving. The other game's challenge, the Story Mode, is the same boardgame style gameplay, but it's you against Gaston in a race to get to the castle. If Gaston gets to the finish on each of the boards before you do, it's game over.  The mini-games are extremely basic and there's nothing here that you haven't seen before. In fact, many of the games are just Disney-ized versions of the Game & Watch titles released by Nintendo. Others are the usual ~concentration,~ ~cup and ball,~ and ~Simon Says~ variety. There are only ten of these games, so chances of hitting two of the games in a row are very good -- and annoyingly common.  The graphics are rather good, and it's what's expected of a Disney game. The animation during the mini-games is well done, but that quality doesn't translate on the game board where these characters slide around like cardboard cutouts on ice.  The reason why this game just can't hold a candle to Mario Party is simple: there's really no variety in Beauty and the Beast. Play the game twice through and you've played all you can in the game. The game isn't bad, and it's obviously aimed at the young girl gamer,  but if only Left Field Productions could have added just a few more games to keep the action up. Slightly above average.", "date": "Oct 26, 1999"}
