On one hand, a handful of gamers and critics alike praised Touch Detective for its bold attempt at a revitalization of the point-and-click genre, looking over some of the game's flaws and embracing the quirky crime drama title fully.  On the flipside, however, others - us included - saw Touch Detective as somewhat of a nonsensical attempt at a game design that has been done infinitely better across other systems years ago.  Now a year later, Touch Detective 2 1/2 heads to DS, and while a few of the decisions this time around have helped the overall product, Touch Detective remains to be the same general experience it was last time around.   With 2 1/2, however, we had a more positive experience overall.  The game follows the same young detective girl Mackenzie and her sidekick Funghi (a wonderful mushroom man) as they investigate the town, gathering information and solving cases that are as brain-bending as they are obscure in nature.  This time around, however, the game seems to be a bit more straightforward in its puzzle layout.  You'll generally know what items you're looking for (or at least what type of item), and always have at least one or two places you can fall back on to get information or hints if needed.  In the first chapter, for example, the local fortune teller was especially useful, as she essentially works as an ever-available status report on our chapter progress, giving hints or updating us as we progressed.        And while the content is still insanely obscure, the puzzle items are a bit more apparent this time around.  You'll still do a ton of random poking on screens should your leads dry up, but for the most part you can hop from section to section of the town and know what you need to be looking for.  There are still the occasional issues with triggers, however, as you can talk to the same person ten times and find nothing, only to have that 11th time work because of some random item you touched or interacted with.  For the most part these momentum-killing moments have been taken care of, but it'll still happen.  One instance had us chatting with Penelope (one of Mackenzie's friends) over and over again, only to realize that we hadn't touched everything in the room around her, and thus were still looking for leads.  In reality we'd already scoured the entire town for clues, only to go back and poke around her room one more time.  If the trigger would have been on the door (assuming the player would have searched everything and been ready to move on) we could have saved a half hour or so of gameplay.   That same ~trigger-to-trigger~ gameplay is felt throughout the rest of the game as well, with simple dialogue and very specific steps needed to initiate the next stream of events; something that Touch Detective would do well to work out.  Rather than putting an emphasis on item collection and the combination/usage of those items, Touch Detective is more about ~tapping the right thing~ to kick start the next chunk of story.  It's a more intuitive experience than it was last year, but it still lacks the true player-vs.-puzzle feel that really challenges gamers to press on.   A certain amount of this ~trial/error~ gameplay is to be expected in games like Touch Detective though, so while the game won't be for everyone - and is still far from point/click greatness as far as we're concerned - it'll still be a solid product for those pocket gamers that hark back to the days of Monkey Island and Grim Fandango.  This year's game is also far more appealing overall due to its continued graphical style, now teaming it with a more robust and open world.  You still never get a fully free experience, as each chapter will have you working within a few specific sections of the world, but there's far more to see this time around, including a superbly designed haunted house, as well as a few more ~out of this world~ environments that we'll keep from spoiling.   And just like the previous game, Touch Detective 2 1/2 makes use of an extremely unique audio/visual presentation, mixing a primarily 2D world with a 3D layout, allowing tons of space to move about the environments while keeping a charming visual style along the way.  The music - some new, some taken from the previous game - is funky and smooth, setting a tone for the characters and world nicely.  The game may be unrelenting in its classic, hardcore nature, but for gamers that can stomach the difficult puzzles they'll be rewarded with one of the most unique audio/visual efforts on DS yet.  As an overall series, Touch Detective has a lot going for it.  The game design is innovative for the hardcore, yet still very traditional, the style is moody and pleasing to the eye, the musical composition and audio experience gives off a great feel, and the characters are unique.  What Touch Detective is still missing, however, is the ability to really connect with the gamer, as puzzles  while better this time around than last year  still rely more on hitting a specific event trigger than actually figuring out direct, challenging puzzles.  Touch Detective is all about obscurity and over-the-top situations, but theres a fine line between quirky storytelling and clumsy gameplay, and unfortunately Touch Detective still sits somewhere in the middle.  The experience can be very entertaining at times, but then instantly shift to become a chore of a game, as youll switch from manipulating AI or piecing together items and treasures to desperate clicking of any/every possible object in the world in an attempt to activate whatever event it is you need to progress the game.  Its a step in the right direction, but Touch Detective 2 1/2 still has a ways to go in achieving classic point-and-click status.", "date": "Oct 23, 2007"}
