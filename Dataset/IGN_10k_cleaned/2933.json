They've tried their hardest to beef a game originally designed for the SNES to 32-bit level, but success was limited.An RPG is all about presentation. Combat, graphics, sound, music, and dialogue are more important than innovation. Until recently, RPGs have been doing fine with sprite based graphics and killer stories.Music is great, with a soundtrack evocative of Panzer Dragoon and classic RPGs. Dialogue is excellent as usual with Working Designs, and meshes well with the animation and character design. Story is good, if a bit drawn out, but the climax is still as exciting as the classics.Unfortunately, technical details bog down what would otherwise be a perfectly playable RPG. The graphics are dated, the small sprites and minimal animation betraying its 16-bit heritage, and the programming code that got ported over to the Saturn has resulted in massive slowdown, which Working Designs has minimized, but not eliminated. It may not seem bad at first, but the more battles and fights you get into, the more the delays hammer into your brain until you could break the CD in half.Pick up Albert Odyssey after you've finished Shining the Holy Ark, because it's pretty good. However, think long and hard if you're impatient, because an odyssey is a long trip, and if you're traveling by rowboat, it seems even longer.", "date": "Jan 29, 1998"}
