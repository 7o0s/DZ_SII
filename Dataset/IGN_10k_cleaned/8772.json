From watching movies to viewing pictures to listening to music, the PSP has long been intended as an all-in-one media playback device. But with Traxxpad, the system's capabilities are expanded to not only allow for prerecorded content, but to create your own music as well.   Traxxpad is not a game, but rather an application. Its competition lies not on the PSP but rather the PC (or Mac). Even something like Electroplankton on the DS, which also lets you create music, doesn't even come close in terms of both style and functionality. Traxxpad truly is a full-featured music composition program designed at creating your own beats.   Tiny dots could form together to top the Billboard charts. It's intended at creating tracks for genres like hip-hop, techno, electronica or even industrial music, but with creative use of its massive library of sounds coupled with the ability to record your own samples, you could create pretty much anything you wanted. Given that you can only record samples a few seconds long you would have to get really creative to utilize a standard vocal track, but pretty much everything else can be done right in Traxxpad.   Basic music creation is done via a number of different screens. In the R.T.I.S.T editor, you record small sequences of music either by recording them via button presses in realtime or placing them note-by-note by hand, or both. After placing notes in the R.T.I.S.T., you can optionally head to the MeLOD editor to change the pitch, sustain and so forth of notes. Once you have a few sequences set up and finalized, you can go into the S.T.A.C. editor and place them in any order you want, and even combine them. So for instance, you could create a ~base~ sequence which has drums, and then a ~lead~ sequence which has other instruments, and then lay the lead sequence over the base sequence in S.T.A.C., or use another sequence as an intro and lead into them. And finally, once you're finished you can save the song for later editing or export the track as an MP3, allowing you to listen to it outside of the program or even take it into another application for additional editing and mixing.   The number of editing options you have is somewhat amazing, given the platform it's on. From changing the pitch and sustain length of notes to being able to perform some clip editing, like changing the gain or reversing a sample, you're given a nice amount of power over the sounds. Its scope is of course limited when compared to full computer programs, like the lack of effects like reverb and chorus, but what's here is great.   It doesn't look like much, but it sounds great. Of course, all of this power means that there are necessarily a lot of screens to manage everything, and so there is a rather big learning curve to overcome, especially if you've never been involved in music creation before. A very nice and simple tutorial included in the manual will drastically speed up your introduction time, and it's almost a necessity that you go through it before diving into the rest of the program. Traxxpad includes a very robust set of help screens, but there are so many that you won't really know where to start unless you already have a grip on the basics.   When you do become comfortable with the interface, you'll find that its power can actually highlight a few of its shortcomings. For instance, you can customize single notes all you want, but aside from the ability to clone notes when you change a sequence length, you can't actually copy-and-paste notes. This can make the creation of repeated parts something of a pain. Also, because of the limited real estate on the screen, there's not as much information in some places as we'd like. For instance, the S.T.A.C. editor only displays sequences as red blocks and doesn't display their saved names, which can make complicated tunes even more so.   For those of you who just want to hop in and jam, the MyXxer is the place to be. It's essentially a stripped-down version of the R.T.I.S.T. editor that lets you assign sounds and play them, but gets rid of all the complicated recording aspects. This is actually a great way to try out all of the sounds and experiment with all of the included samples, and can get you itchy for some actual recording.   Closing Comments  Traxxpad is a very interesting release as it's not a game but rather a full-fledged music production program. It's extremely powerful for what it is, but that also means it's complicated and not as user-friendly as a computer-based equivalent. Folks who have never dabbled in music creation before will find this a fantastic (and relatively cheap) introduction into the art, though you'll need a bit of patience and the will to learn to be able to take full advantage of it.", "date": "Jul 7, 2007"}
