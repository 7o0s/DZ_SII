Once again it proves to be the best in its field, but it still needs a lot of fine-tuning in order for it to gain the same legendary status as EA's NHL and NFL games.   Gameplay As we've all come to expect from EA Sports games, this game has it all. Live 2000 is loaded with gameplay features that will undoubtedly make any die-hard basketball fan wobbly in the knees. The normal stuff like the exhibition mode, season mode, and playoffs are all here. Plus, extras like a 1-on-1 mode, 3 Point Shootout, Practice mode, and NBA Legends mode are also present.   The 1-on-1 mode is the newest addition to the NBA Live series. It enables you to pit NBA stars in a 1-on-1 match-up on an outdoor court. Players can use any of their favorite current NBA stars, plus past all-stars from the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, and '90s. This enables players to setup match-ups like Dr. J versus Michael Jordan or Larry Bird versus Magic Johnson. The gameplay in this mode is pretty basic and isn't too deep, but it is fun to play around in and is a blast to mess around with against other human opponents.   There is also an Arcade mode. In this mode, the action is 5-on-5 but takes an NBA Jam style approach. There are no rules, you can knock down players, go out of bounds and perform some out-of-this world dunks.   While it's fun to mess around in the arcade, 1-on-1, Legends, and 3 Point Shootout modes, the most significant play mode is undeniably the season mode with the simulation setting. This puts the player in a real NBA season with all the rules and the most realistic gameplay available. It's the closest that most of us can get to playing in the NBA.   For the most part, EA Sports has successfully created a complete NBA basketball simulation. As usual, you have complete control over the players and they respond instantly to your button presses. The game player has total control over what the on-court character does. Everything from the fade-aways, dunks, spin moves, crossovers, steals, and hand-checks are completely in your control.   The computer's artificial intelligence is the best that you'll see in any PlayStation hoops game. On the All-star and Superstar difficulty settings, the CPU will respond in a fairly realistic manner. However, there still are plenty of instances where the CPU will pass up easy drives or easy shots.   Another problem is that the difficulty isn't really handled that well. The computer does get a little better on the higher settings, but most of the difficulty changes only affect the human player. Instead of it getting harder to stop the CPU opponent as the difficulty increases, it instead seems to just get harder to make shots.    While playing on the Superstar difficulty setting, there wasn't a single game played in simulation mode over a total of about 20 games that the computer had a field goal percentage over 40%. Most games saw the computer shoot well under 30% from the floor. The games still proved to be challenging because the computer was very good at getting offensive rebounds.   This brings up another grievance. The computer-controlled teammates seemed to have a weaker AI than the opponents that were controlled by the CPU. On most rebounds, the CPU teammates would jump up and towards the rim, only to have the rebound go over their heads and right into the hands of the opponent.  Even with the gameplay set to crash the boards, it was fairly common for the CPU opponent to dominate the offensive boards.   Graphics Live 2000 is among the elite when it comes to basketball games on the PlayStation. The game starts out with an excellent FMV introduction that's by far the best I've seen for any sports videogame. It features a brilliant collection of dunks, exciting plays and some fine NBA cheerleaders all spliced together in an exciting intro.   The gameplay graphics are also top-notch, yet far from perfect. The player motion is generally really smooth and the game features some of the best-animated basketball players you'll find on the PS. For instance, when watching the action on the court, you'll notice little things like players turning their heads to look toward the man that they're supposed to be covering.   There are also numerous signature moves for he NBA stars, plus little extras like knuckle touches and extra free throw animations. In some cases, the players will look a lot like their real-life counterparts, but for the most part, they only slightly resemble them. Players vary in height and size, but they still don't really represent the real NBA players as accurately as they should. For instance, Shaq doesn't quite stand out as much in Live 2000 because of his size like he does in the NBA.   The game's biggest problem in the graphics department is its horrible framerate. The framerate is really choppy during the game and it worsens when one of the auto-replays begins. While this is a problem that needs to be remedied, it actually doesn't hinder the gameplay at all.   Sound The play-by-play is handled by Don Poier (Vancouver Grizzlies), with color commentary by two-time NBA All-Star Reggie Theus. In general, the color commentary that is provided lacks emotion and seems pretty dry, but the play-by-play is much more enthusiastic. It's still nothing special and it won't impress anyone.   All the in-game sounds are there, with excellent noises for the ball bouncing, shoes squeaking, and balls slamming off the rim or backboard. The crowd cheers and noises are good and help add to the game's enjoyment. Lastly, the music that's included with Live 2000 is the best you'll find in any console basketball videogame.NBA Live 2000 is undeniably the best basketball game currently on the PlayStation. It's jam-packed with all the features that any die-hard hoops fan would want in a basketball game. And with all of the Legends, it's bound to attract fans of previous generations. Personally, I grew up with players like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Dr. J, so playing around with the '80s team was especially pleasurable. Whilst the game is loaded with features and does so many things right, I found a lot of flaws in it. The AI of your teammates could use a lot of improvement and so many things need to be done to the game to make it more realistic. All of this brings me to my dilemma: Live 2000 is the best basketball game on the system, it's better than the previous games in the series, and last year's version was given a 9.0. Conversely, the game has a lot of flaws and doesn't deserve any sort of legendary status. So, how should it be rated? Should I go with strictly how I think the game should be and rate it on that solely? Or should I rate it solely on how it compares to other games in its genre? After a lot of thought, I decided to take both things into consideration when giving it the 8.8. It's better than Live '99 and Shootout '97 even though each of those received 9.0s. However, neither of the games deserves to be rated that high, nor does Live 2000. It's a very good game and the best on the system, but I think that things can be better. In fact, they can be much better. PlayStation basketball fans that have been pleased with the Live series will buy this game and will most likely be pleased with the game and their purchase. I personally expect a LOT from my sports games, more so than any other genre.  EA Sports has managed to meet my expectations with its NHL series and Madden NFL series. Live doesn't reach my lofty expectations. Though, it's still a solid and enjoyable gaming experience and I recommend it for any PlayStation owner looking to buy an NBA basketball game.", "date": "Dec 7, 1999"}
