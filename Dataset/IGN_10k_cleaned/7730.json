It's campaign is more akin to that of Apple's iPod in conquering mass-market penetration through form and function, rather than latest and greatest hardware. One of the most effective ways of reaching this broader market, affectionately referred to in Nintendo-business-speak as Blue Ocean, has been through the carefully plotted release of Wii Play, coming bundled with a wiimote.   Why is this shrewd? The answer is clear - surely this 'game' won't shift units based on inherent gameplay, particularly when stacked up against higher-profile games that burn much more brightly in the public eye. So, instead of whacking a bargain price on this disc and calling it a day, Nintendo has assembled a 'training package' of sorts - a kind of beginners' guide to the wonders of the wiimote, if you will.   Like Wii Sports, the pack-in sports game compilation, Wii Play aims to demonstrate the range of functions the Wii is capable of, while teaching-through-playing, rather than reading a manual. Included are 9 games that immediately struck us as somewhat familiar. Several of these titles, in more basic forms, were how Nintendo originally introduced the press to the motion-controlled concepts behind Wii. Only makes sense that Nintendo included a couple of these, nicely reworked, in Wii Play.   Eventually, you'll reach skeet shooting and duck hunting stages. So ye olde schoole!  Starting with the basics of pointing and clicking, the first game you'll tackle is the shooting range. Graphically simple, the gameplay is a throwback to Duck Hunt, with a little bit of Point Blank thrown in there for good measure. The idea is to shoot the targets as they pop up, one after the other. It isn't rocket science. With two players, however, vying for a sole target can be a bit of fun - particularly when the pace picks up.   Upon completing this first training game, you'll likely be awarded a medal (bronze, silver, gold) based on your performance. Herein lays the core competitive aspect to the game. By utilising your console's Mii characters, you can track high scores, personal bests and medals awarded. It isn't incredibly extensive, but it's nice to be able to compare your stats against other Miis in your Wii's memory. A little message will also pop up in your message board when you obtain a new award.   Next up is Find Mii - another pointer skills game. This time, however, you're vested the task of finding a specific Mii character in a shuffling crowd of Miis. After highlighting the character with your cursor, hitting A will select him or her. If you nailed the selection, your time will be extended and the game continues on. If you mess up, you eat into your time and have to choose again. In two-player mode, it's a case of the first player to find the Mii gets the points, and messing up decreases your score.    Things start to get a little more interesting with Table Tennis, the third game in the sequence. Played by simply swinging the wiimote left and right while pointing at the screen, there isn't a whole lot of depth to the gameplay. In fact, it's almost a polar opposite to Wii Sport's Tennis, where the movement is automatic, but the swing of the racquet is literally in your hands. In the case of Table Tennis, your paddle will automatically swing for you - removing the tactics of fore- or backhand play, as well as power control. In real terms, what this means is that your volleys will become enormous - like a speedy game of (unsurprisingly) Pong. It's good fun, and the sheer simplicity and responsiveness of the paddle movement means that when you miss a shot, it's human error at work, and not unreliable controls. It's also the first game in the line-up that you'll likely want to play more than one round of - there is a definite addictive quality to the 'pure' gameplay that hasn't changed since the late 70s.   Things take a turn for the complex by stage four's Pose Mii. Initially simple, the wiimote's ability to sense twisting left and right, in addition to X and Y axis motions, is put to the test. Your on-screen indicator becomes a little asexual stick figure that can be shifted and rotated around the screen with a flick of the wrist. By pressing A or B, you can choose cycle through different poses for the figure to take on, with the ultimate goal to create an exact match of a silhouette on the screen.   By sliding the character over the top, rotating and shifting poses, you'll match the pose and you can move onto the next shape. All the while, however, the silhouette is descending from the top of the screen to the bottom with good speed, Tetris-style. If it hits the base of the screen, you lose a life. Miss three and it's good night, New Hampshire.   The longer your game, the more fans gather to watch the rally.  It's tricky with one player, but downright frantic with two. Competing for poses and racing against the endless torrent of silhouettes is maddening and fun, but a little short-lived. For a rapid-fire puzzler of sorts, its inclusion is nothing to sniff at, though.    Stage five is a combination of the skills from Table Tennis and Pose Mii - that is, lots of pointing and twisting in a game called Laser Hockey. And it's gold. With an artistic style reminiscent of minimalist-wire frame shooter, Geometry Wars, and a neon colour-scheme that would make Tron proud, it's possibly our pick of the litter.   The game, on first appearance, is a simple variation of Pong yet again - however, the Wiimote's flexibility adds heretofore-unseen depth to the mix. Firstly, your hockey paddle can be moved around your half of the 'court' freely and smoothly. Second, it can be rotated for careful aiming by twisting the wiimote. Third, the harder you swing the wiimote towards the puck, the faster it goes. Finally, by hitting A and B buttons at the same time before the game commences, you can change the shape of your paddle to mix things up a bit.   The pace is relentless and forces you to make the most of the twist-action of the wiimote in order to deflect pucks that have been bounced diagonally at your goal off of walls. When playing in two-player mode, the 8-point game limit goes by pretty quickly, which is perfect for pass-the-controller parties. Really, it's a crowd-pleaser due to the pick-up-and-play simplicity, rather than flashy effects. Again, this is Nintendo's current philosophy in a nutshell.     Billiards, that staple component of any good mini-game collection, sits at stage six. Using the wiimote like a cue comes naturally, since the elongated shape caters for that kind of grip nicely. By holding down B and aiming the reticule at the screen, you can swing the camera around the pool table in order to line up the best possible shot. Once you're satisfied, pressing B again brings up a cue. Aiming at specific parts of the cue ball allows you to apply top or backspin.   Holding down B and pulling the wiimote towards you allows you to pull the virtual cue backwards, in preparation for your shot. As soon as you're happy you have the right amount of power for the shot, release B and move the wiimote forwards. And that's it. Usual pub rules apply - pocket the balls in order, from lowest number to highest.    It's a deep billiards simulator with enough precision to the control scheme to emulate the actual game to some degree. The physics of the ball movement across the table seems just a little feathery, however. But it certainly isn't dramatic enough to detract from the experience. That said, if you've played snooker, billiards or pool games before, this ends up feeling a little derivative rather than exciting. We can completely understand the inclusion, but we'd definitely have preferred something a little more original to demonstrate the wiimote's abilities - perhaps that model airplane flight-simulator originally demonstrated in the Wii's fledgling days.   Stage seven is an X/Y/Z axis challenge: Fishing. A small pond and a school of fish with different point values is your playground. By shifting the position of the wiimote in space, you can move the on-screen fishing rod around, and by luring the fish to the floating bobber, a flick of the wiimote's nose upwards propels the hooked fish into the air where you collect the associated point value.   Like a cross between a flourescent tubing display and Geometry Wars, with great physics to boot.  If you wait too long, the fish will get away - however, the subtle vibration of a hooked fish is all you need to feel in order to flick up your catch. With two players, things get a little crazy - if you hook the same fish at the same time, the first player to flick it out of the water gets the points. Accusations of 'fish-camping' began to fly after a couple heated rounds, too.    Eight stages in, and the wiimote finally gets turned on its side, NES pad-style. The aim in Charge! is to race your cow against your competitors bovine by tilting the pad left and right to steer, forwards to accelerate and backwards to ease off the cow-cellerator. While your beast is charging on, you'll occasionally have to jump gates and other hazards - to do so, you just raise the whole controller upwards for a second. Simple. During the race, you'll also have to run down lines of scarecrows to build up your score - so, although you might win the race, the person with the highest score can take that victory away from you.   The steering mechanic is a little hit-and-miss - sometimes you'll feel like your cow is drastically understeering, and other times the analogue nature of the tilt seems downright unresponsive. This can't be blamed on the sensor bar, which we understand is unrelated to the tilt-mechanics of the wiimote. So instead, it comes down to more of a personal preference issue. Heck, we've never ridden a cow before - maybe they do steer like a 56 Chevy.    Finally, the ninth stage is the culmination of all the skills you've learned up to this point. It also marks the only game in the line-up that caters for nunchuk and control stick use - although, both players will need to have the attachment connected in order to play with this control setup.   Tanks! is the name of this game, and the gameplay is a challenging mix of steering your tank, aiming with the wiimote and onscreen reticule and using the A and B buttons to fire shells and drop mines respectively.    The game features multiple levels where up to four tanks battle it out, with shells that bounce off walls, mines that detonate when approached (or left untouched for too long) and clever level design. However, the two player mode is annoyingly short-sighted. The first player to kill the opposing tank wins, and the round is over. The next map loads and the same rules apply. There isn't an option for a head-to-head, first-to-30-kills mode, for instance.    Actually, the lack of options for any of the mini-games really limits the lifespan of Wii Play dramatically. Beyond conquering the medals table, the appeal of multiplayer will wear thin sooner rather than later. We would've liked to see some flexible settings included to extend the lifespan of the game a little bit more.    The fishing game is lovingly rendered in a cute papercraft-and-crayon 2D setting.  Also unfortunate is that all of the games only allow for a maximum of two players. While this is by no means a massive failure by any stretch, it is a noticeable shortcoming - particularly since some of the included games already cater to four characters on screen at once - Tanks! - We're looking at you here.   Production values are fair; each game has a distinct look to proceedings. The fishing game in particular, with its child-like paper-and-crayon setting is very striking, if not a graphical showcase of effects. The games are colourful and clean, running with clarity even at 480i. The entire game sits somewhere in line with the graphical and aural quality of Wii Sports.   It's hard to be critical of a game that is effectively being sold at AU$10 on top of the cost of a wiimote. It is definitely more of a training disc for first-time Wii gamers; the fact that Nintendo have gone to this length is heartening to see. Clearly, the company understands that the Wii's controller is a unique interface and releasing Wii Play, a training disc under the guise of a fully-fledged game, is a slick move. There definitely isn't enough gameplay here to threaten the multiplayer goodness of a game like Rayman Raving Rabbids, for instance, but for an extra tenner, you really can't go wrong. It's not a full-release game but then, it doesn't try to be. As a training game, it succeeds completely.", "date": "Dec 2, 2006"}
