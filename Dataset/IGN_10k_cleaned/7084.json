It's Namco Bandai's second such release on the Live Arcade this summer, the first being Frogger two weeks ago. In terms of how Galaga fares on the XBLA, it's not the best port to be released. It misses out on some opportunities for expanded gameplay by omitting alternating co-operative play offline and on. Still, it remains entertaining.   The game is simple. By moving the ship left and right, players can blast out two shots at a time. Enemies spiral onscreen and take up positions at its top, after which they dive bomb the player's ship. Once all enemies onscreen are defeated, players advance to the next stage. Peppered in between are several bonus stages where players can grab points without the worry of enemy fire. Aside from that, Galaga's gameplay centers on acquiring the elusive double ship upgrade, the greatest secret in all of videogames. (Not really...)   While Frogger gave gamers the opportunity to play with two players, Galaga offers no such feature. The gameplay is strictly single player, though it does provide online leaderboards. Why the multiplayer aspects of Galaga present in the arcade version were omitted from the Xbox Live Arcade release is strange. Nevertheless, Galaga's core gameplay remains intact.    Galaga provides gamers with little to no extra features. There are no options in Galaga to overlay enhanced graphics or sound. On an HD set the area of play takes up about a third of the screen. The other two thirds are filled with static Galaga art that mimics an arcade unit. The play area retains an aspect ratio with more vertical affinity than horizontal. Should players desire to alter its size, there's an option to do so. While the screen size can be manipulated, it will always maintain the same proportions, so players will never see any sprite stretching.   With the Xbox 360 controller, Galaga handles fairly well. The thumbstick works fine for craft control, but the controller button just can't quite measure up to an arcade button. Slamming the A button with a thumb to fire feels awkward compared to smashing an entire hand on the fire button at an arcade unit. The game attempts to rectify this to a degree by offering an option for a rapid shot. By pressing and holding the B button, the ship fires as quickly as possible. This means the maximum of two bullets at a time will more rapidly be dispensed into the field of play. Unfortunately, this takes away from the excitement of the old arcade version, which involved madly hammering away at the fire button. This way, players could make sure another shot was fired as soon as one hit an enemy or traveled offscreen. There is something very un-Galaga, if you'll permit such a term to be used, about simply holding a button and watching the screen.    One new feature provided, aside from the online leaderboards and rapid fire button, is the way continues work. Instead of just hitting continue as soon as you die, the game gives you the ability to start fresh from any stage reached. Though this may help for unlocking some of the achievements that challenge players to reach stages 20 and 30, players will still be missing out on the points they would have acquired during the earlier levels. For Galaga fans, this 400 Microsoft Point ($5 USD) title is pretty much a must have with its online leaderboards. As of this article being published, the high scores are already astronomical, proving the hardcore community has already adopted.   For those who've never delved into Galaga's repetitive madness, it's worth the investment even if this isn't the best version available. Still, a co-operative mode would have been much appreciated, online or off.", "date": "Jul 26, 2006"}
