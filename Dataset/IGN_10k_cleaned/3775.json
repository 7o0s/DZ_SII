In fact, the most you can hope for is a goofy, mindless diversion starring fluffy farm animals that will amuse you while you wait for the ever-late subway.   Features: Fast-paced puzzler Plentiful barnyard SFX  Small hopes can sometimes deliver.  Barnyard Bouncin' is just what we described, a single-minded piece of entertainment that allows you to put your mind on 'numb' and just enjoy a few feverish minutes of silly gameplay.  You are a farmer that has ordered a bunch of new animals for your farm, but instead of being trucked in, the fuzzies are being dropshipped in.  You must scurry across the bottom of the screen, keeping those animals up in the air, aiming them at three repositories on screen: barn, hayloft, and chicken coop.  As you you clear screen after screen, more and more animals will appear, and you'll need to drive specific livestock to their respective homes.  For example, the chicken go in the henhouse, cows in the barn, and dogs in the hayloft.  Barnyard Bouncin' is as simple as you can get, but for a cheapie action/puzzler, it works.  Helping the proceedings is a great soundtrack.  Sure, there's no downhome banjo-pluckin' farmhouse jams, but each of the animals has a plaintive squeal as they bounce of your arms.  The cows 'moo' appropriate, kitties 'meow,' piggies 'oink,' and chickens do that 'baaaaahk' sound they do.  This may not sound like much, but consider how many other games manage to botch up sound effects.  Of course, Barnyard Bouncin' isn't much to look at.  Sure the colors are bright and the the animals are decently detailed, but the the whole thing is pretty plain compared to some of the other games currently available of Verizon's Get-It-Now service.   (We tested Barnyard Bouncin' on a Motorola T7720.)  What your probably wondering at this point is whether or not you should even bother with this DL.  Well, if you want just a goofball puzzler that makes lots -- and we mean lots -- of noise, then give up a few bucks for Barnyard Bouncin'.  It's certainly a better investment than Universal's ugly Hulk puzzler.If you enjoyed SEGA Mobile's animal-themed Baku Baku, then there's a good chance you'll get a kick out of Head First's Barnyard Bouncin'.  And also consider it a good thing to have on your phone if a small child in your family wants to goof around with your cellphone and you don't want your almost-cleared game of Splinter Cell to get toasted.", "date": "Jul 14, 2003"}
