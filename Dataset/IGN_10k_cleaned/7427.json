It's just one of those things. So when a game comes along promising to shoot sci-fi fans into the cosmos, and in the captain's chair of the Enterprise no less, it's exciting news. Having said that, very few games have done much with the Star Trek License. Developers have exploited the show's aesthetic and characters, sometimes a little of that Federation atmosphere, but rarely have videogames done the franchise justice.   Sadly, Star Trek: Encounters does little to change the trend. On the contrary, it has the same intrinsic faults that have plagued a majority of older Trek games. Making matters worse, it has its own unique set of problems that shouldn't appear in any game, regardless of genre or theme. Encounters won't shatter the bank account, since it's only 20 bucks, but it offers nothing to set itself apart as an actual Trek game, let alone a worthy budget purchase. A total shame, really, because if there's anything worse than a bad sci-fi game, it's a bad Start Trek game. That just hurts. And it's been hurting a long time now.   For all the above negativity, Encounters has a promising setup. It highlights a series of episodes from every show in the franchise, from the recent Enterprise to Star Trek Voyager and beyond. Each show only has a handful of episodes available, none of which take very long to finish, and still ~playing~ through the Star Trek timeline is an undeniably cool concept. But that's enough to keep Encounters cruising peacefully. During the very first episode, players will encounter most of what's wrong with the game, specifically how it controls and how each starship interacts with objects in space. And as a side note, Encounters is a very linear game that forces a player to go in chronological order. Fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation will need to finish episodes in Enterprise and the original Trek show first, and then move to their favorites.   Players control various starships with the left analog stick and aim their weapons using the right. The game plays out in the third-person, so would-be captains will never see the inside of the ships. There's no ordering of crewman, either, and the same goes for day-to-day interactions with Starfleet personal. What's worse, the actual ships don't handle like massive, capital-class vessels. Instead, they turn rather easily and can even u-turn without much trouble. The camera also hangs back pretty far from the action, so it never feels like controlling enormous starships. It feels much closer to playing a videogame about radio-controlled cars, only with a Star Trek skin. Sure, Encounters has phasers, sensors and photon torpedoes, and they even sound and look like their TV counterparts, but combat is less than riveting.    Speaking of combat, that's about all there is to Encounters. Which would be fine, if it were a little closer to a game like Bridge Commander, but it lacks the strategy and flexibility required. Instead, players go through episode after episode of blasting asteroids, ho-hum enemies and mines. Strangely enough, most of the game plays out in three plans of levitation, so players need to adjust their height by using the shoulder buttons. Thing is, the default elevation lies in the middle, so even after lowering or raising elevation to blast a ship, the Enterprise (or whichever vessel) eventually goes back.   This makes combat, and everything else in the game, feel awkward. Throw in some funky ship controls, and most of the game simply doesn't play that well. Not only that, certain sections of the game force players to hunt warp signatures by finding green energy trails. After passing through one trail, the next one illuminates, and so on. Thing is, it feels entirely random. It's easy to pass through one without subsequent signals ever showing up. And since the whole affair is timed, it forces players to restart. This sucks. A lot.   Encounters suffers from a dire lack of Star Trek. There's very little point in using the Star Trek license without exploiting its greatest assets. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happens here. Take away the name and there's little here that resembles the long-running franchise at all. And while playing through different eras of the Trek timeline is a great concept, and definitely has its appeal, the actual gameplay doesn't do it justice. It's a bargain title, but even gamers strapped for cash need to know Encounters is Star Trek only in name, not in function.", "date": "Oct 24, 2006"}
