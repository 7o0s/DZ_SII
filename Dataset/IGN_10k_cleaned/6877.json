He--and 90% of the time he is a he--opens the box, boldly emblazoned with the NASCAR logo. It's a pinball game! And not just a pinball game, but a NASCAR pinball game!  Within is a CD, a 20-page manual tucked in the jewel case, while from out the denuded box tumbles a series of cardboard advertisements, hawking further wares.  Flat out baffled by the use of the word ~Ultra~ in the title, and somewhat unsure what the term ~3D~ actually means in the context of a prone 2D pinball game, our gamer nonetheless installs the game, all 50 megabytes. And what does he find? Little pinball tables dressed up like NASCAR garages and tracks, as if this were some sort of racing game.  Using the Windows palette and a few audio clips from TV, 3D Ultra NASCAR Pinball tries to recreate the Big Race, hopes to capture the essence of sitting in the grandstands under a hot, beating sun with thousands of shirtless fans swigging Old Milwaukee, cheering the logo-plastered cars as they whip by, lap after lap; the cars vibrating the very molecules of the air with the constant hum of their high performance engines, tingeing the fan's sweat with their reek of scorched tires and gasoline; and the fans, paper cups in hand, the reek of fuel oil in their nostrils, watch the race in beery somnolence, but secretly, secretly they wish for a spectacular end-over-end crash that sends tires flying and flames leaping in a fiery paroxysm of death and destruction; a primal carnage of twisted steel and crushed bodies...  Well there is none of that here. This is a barebones pinball game with a bankable license. You get the logos of NASCAR, its drivers and its corporate sponsors, but nothing of its striving and thunder.  One of the more deplorable trends in the game industry today (one of only many deplorable trends in the game industry today) is a pernicious little virus called cross marketing. This means to take a license, any license, and graft it upon something else, however inappropriate. This game performs this feat twice over. Once, by crossing pinball with stock cars. Twice, by letting the crass commercialism of stock car racing bleed over to the computer screen.  NASCAR drivers must support their expensive hobby with blatant commercial advertisements, so that some of the most advanced cars on the planet are painted up likes boxes of McDonald's French Fries. And because this is a NASCAR game, Sierra saw fit to include the ~authentic~ NASCAR details, right down to odious advertisements for Corn Flakes and hamburgers.  I am reminded of nothing so much as that old game show ~The Price is Right~, where commercial products like cake mix and car wax become the stars of the show. So next time, why should Sierra even bother with the trappings of the NASCAR drivers? Why not make a pinball game that is simply a series of corporate advertisements--begin by exploring the McDonald land table, advance to the bowl of Corn Flakes, finish up in Nike Town?  But anyway.  When stripped of its cross marketing trappings, when judged solely as a pinball game, 3-D Ultra NASCAR Pinball reveals itself as a mediocre, sub-par affair. But that's true of most pinball games on the market. Pinball, though but a little niche in the many-cornered world of PC gaming, is entirely owned by Empire's peerless Pro Pinball series. These wild-eyed fanatics know more of the history, physics, and appeal of pinball than anyone I've ever met. I had one of them talk to me about pinball until I was politely backing away, seeking an exit. To them, pinball is not some crude antecedent to videogames proper, an outdated telegraph to today's eventual telephone, but rather a cunning, crafty art in and of itself.  None of that obsessive, passionate attention to detail manifests in Sierra's line of pinball games, and never has: like most of the other also-rans in pinball, the series is known for its mushy physics, flat presentation, fuzzy detail, and its failure to even employ basic tactics, like scrolling the screen.  Picture a real pinball table in your mind. It is three or four times as long as it is wide! To recreate this on the computer screen, which is wider than it is tall, you must scroll the table! Otherwise, if you cram the whole table on one screen, you force the gamer to squint, as if he was playing pinball from twenty feet across the room.  Certainly the ball mechanics, resolution, and customizability of the controls has been improved this time around, as this is the series' fourth outing, but overall the thing is still more reminiscent of some aging piece of shareware than something from one of the larger game publishers.  Is there anything to like? Dated technology and nefarious ploys aside, the actual design itself is clever. First, you play a table in your ~garage~, where you must hit the ball against some particular spots in order to simulate ~fixing your brakes~ or ~inflating your tires~. Then you advance to the ~qualifying lap~; the better you do the better your pole position in the ensuing big race. During the race, you are adjured to make certain plays--knock the ball into the First Lap gate, then sequentially into the Second Lap gate, etc., in order to move your ~car~ further up in the standings. This is mildly entertaining for a little while, but ends up feeling linear and restrictive.   Not that it's bad to play with the design of pinball--certainly in a computer recreation, slavish simulation of something as essentially uninteresting as pinball is hardly mandatory; in fact it is good that the designer tries to have other, interesting things going on.   But this particular game is too pat and timid, and its backbone--its physics and graphics--are so dated, that the entire outing drifts quickly out of memory. Cheapen the mix further with McMarketing, and the whole thing crumbles. It's certainly not worth $20, or your attention.   --Jason Bates", "date": "Jan 28, 1999"}
