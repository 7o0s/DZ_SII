Don't take this the wrong way; this series is, and always has been, a fun action-platform romp...it's just challenging as bloody hell and not for the easily irritated. Features Original SNES version New Rearrange Mode Cartridge save (two slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts on the Game Boy Advance is a damn-close port of the game released on the Super NES back in 1991, but with a lot more added to the product. Players take control of our hero in armor Arthur, set out to rescue his babe-in-waiting Princess Guinevere...a damsel-in-distress that's been put in that situation by yet-another undead beast. Players must get Arthur through eight of the most devious platform challenges ever conceived in a videogame. He'll have to run, jump, and shoot his way through pure evil areas like graveyards, haunted shipyards and castles. Take a hit, and our hero runs around the area in his boxers...a second hit will kill him off and it's back to the beginning of the level. Throughout the levels you'll activate hidden trigger points that will cause treasure chests to rise from the ground. The more awkward the placement of the triggerpoint, the better the treasure...and this is where you'll find the coveted Magic Armor that'll give your character a bit more of an edge. Even with these enhancements, this game's difficulty goes all the way up to eleven...even when it's set on ~Easy~ in the options menu.  What makes this game so dang hard is the untraditional way Arthur moves. Like all platform heroes, Arthur can run and jump along his side-scrolling terrain...and in the Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts series, Capcom designers gave this guy a double jump. But unlike most action heroes, players cannot control Arthur's jump in the air...once he vaults airborne, you can't change his trajectory until he's got both feet back on the ground. Sure, it's more realistic this way, but man...the gameplay issues that arise from this simple idea in character control is just insane. This is completely intentional, and it's obvious that the level designers got off on making some of the most difficult platform layouts ever conceived. You have to learn how far and how high Arthur will go with a single or double jump, otherwise you'll find yourself bumping into evil caskets, zombies, ghosts, and other undead threats. The only way to get through each of the levels in the game is to mentally map out the patterns the enemies move and attack...you honestly have zero chance running through a level the first time successfully. No freakin' way.  Along with the original set of difficulty insanity from the Super NES days, Capcom also created a brand new ~remix~ mode that rearranges the Super NES levels with sprinklings from levels in the past games of the series...most notably the Genesis/arcade version of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Not to add anymore pressure to the already intense gameplay or anything, but if you complete a level in Remix Mode wearing magic armor, you can choose a separate path in the level structure. Complete the level wearing the uber-armor and you can chose a third, even more difficult area in the level structure. This task is incredibly harsh, since you'll have to locate the hidden triggerpoints that'll net you not only the magic armor and the super magic armor...but you'll also have to hold onto the armor without taking a hit during the tough boss battles. Did I mention how crazy difficult this game is?  Luckily, though, the Game Boy Advance version is the first game in the series with cartridge save. At any point during the normal or rearranged modes, you can pause the game and save your stats...the game will record your continues (which you can earn by picking up bags of gold), as well as the current weapon in-hand.  This does weigh the game a bit more in the player's favor, especially since all of the games in the series required players to get through the game in one sitting.  And even though the game is insanely hard, the game has that ~just one more time~ feel to its design, because it really is about learning the levels, seeing the gaps in attacks, and figuring out how the enemies respond to your weaponry. Once the pattern's been learned, it's all about implementing the attack plan by your skillful thumbs.  The conversion isn't flawless, but neither were the games that it's based upon. The original Super NES game was plagued with that ever-familiar first-generation slowdown, and while the GBA version cleans up most of that, there are still pockets of it throughout the game's levels. But believe it or not, the slowdown sometimes helps, because the crawling pace actually assists in showing players the gaps they can jump through...even if they're leaping in slowmotion towards their imminent death. The game does feature some nifty graphical effects, like the trip up the tower, or rotating windmills. The soundtrack is actually as good as the SNES, and the Genesis levels sound way better on the GBA. I kid you not...this game is the most difficult game ever made. But what's interesting is that as frustrating as it is, the game is still fun to play. I do believe that the game should lighten up on gamers, at least in the first level, because there are some places that are just way too unfair to those just starting out.  But even with the difficulty breaking the ~expert~ scale, this is a keeper...and it'll take you quite a few times through to see everything. Thankfully the game offers that necessary cartridge save...it could have used sleep mode as well, but that's picking nits.This game is definitely recommended...but take some stress pills before you boot up the cartridge.", "date": "Sep 26, 2002"}
