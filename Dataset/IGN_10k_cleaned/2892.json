A strategy and action fanatic to be sure, I would have thought going in that talking about a simple hybrid of the two genres would have been a walk in the park. After all, I've been doing this for quite some time now, and weighing the good aspects with the bad has slowly become a natural process I undertake the second I play anything -- regardless of its beginnings.   But with the long overdue console unveiling of hardcore PC favorite Commandos 2: Men of Courage on the PlayStation 2, I'm left with the distinct feeling of an impossibility to judge; an almost indistinguishable gray area that leaves me scratching my head in wonderment and disbelief. As much as I played through the game's many missions and daunting scenarios, I couldn't quite figure out if I liked the Pyro Studios-developed action-clicker, or just kept going for the end in a bout of pure determination.   Eventually, I figured out exactly what I needed to know (the answers are much clearer when you're not swearing at your television set in a dubious rage) and the responsibility of fulfilling my duties as an editor to help out our curious readers was a proposition I could honestly tackle. Might I add however, that it was a revelation that didn't come without its own modest share of perilous adventure and numbingly anxious bouts of reloading.   Premise  The idea behind Commandos 2: Men of Courage is pretty straight forward. After a rather convincing full motion video showing actual footage of World War II, Hitler, and the British Special Forces, it's established that you are Sergeant ~Tiny~ McHale, leader of the European commandos and one of the only offensive weapons that the early allies have against the Third Reich and its Japanese ally.   Putting you in control of a plethora of Dirty Dozen type characters, the paper-thin storyline really only serves as a near-transparent bridge between the different stages and its locations, and the objectives are just as simple: Be it victory through hostage rescue, enemy elimination, or another method best left to the imagination, your squad has to swim, climb, run, shoot, steal, and crawl their way through a dozen massive scenarios that tell a not-so public story of World War II. Break out your thumb sticks and thinking caps, and it's off to the show!    Gameplay  I'm a huge fan of just about any tactical strategy game. So passionate about the genre in fact, that I'll even attempt the most anally reflective product the subset can manufacture. X-Com, Fallout Tactics, General Chaos, The Master of Monsters and a slew of other popular and forgotten entries litter my experience like mines on the beach of Normandy. To be quite frank, I love the idea of being able to control the tides of a battle guerilla style. Take multiple paths every time I play, and figure out the most effective method possible to become the biggest and baddest soldier on the planet. Luckily, Commandos 2 allows me to do that for as long as I see fit, but not without a laundry-sized list of frustrations.   An issue already mentioned with the far superior PC version released late last year, the incredibly complex control scheme will take some getting used to. And when I say getting used to, I'm talking about investing several hours of trial and error blunder sessions that could see 90% of PS2 gamers pulling their hair out by the roots.    Not designed in any way to be a ~pick up and go~ type of offering, Men of Courage is assuredly aimed at dedicated strategy fans only. If you just so happen to dabble in the genre every now and then or plan on busting through a line of nazis with machine guns blazing, I can tell you right now -- you're not going to like this game. Commandos 2 is a slow, methodical, exercise in patience and resolve, leaving you in plenty of situations that can find you loading your save-game over and over again (possibly even hundreds of times) before reaching the conclusion. This game is absurdly difficult, and personally I like it that way.   Spread out over twelve scenarios (two of which are extra-long training missions), Men of Courage puts you in control of several different types of personalities. Whether you're a Green Beret, a Thief, a Demolitions Expert, or some other type of hardened grunt, constructing the best way to use each of these characters skill is the key to gaining victory for your challenges. While it may be a good idea to use your Green Beret to stealth a lazy guard with a dagger before stealing his clothes and blending in, it may be an even better maneuver to send your explosives guy near the underside of a bridge to limit enemy movement, and make it easier to move around your space. The possibilities aren't quite as endless as they sound, but do offer up a legitimate variety in the approaches you can take when completing a task, and for this Commandos 2 should be revered.   Something that can't receive quite as many accolades though, is the aforementioned control setup. While the programmers have done a fairly decent job of porting the difficult keyboard and mouse controls of the PC game to the Dual Analog controller, it'll prove to be way too much for the under-coordinated. Utilizing almost every possible button and directional combination you can think of, players have to switch between ~Look~ and ~Interaction~ modes, use two buttons simultaneously to fire at opponents while still moving around with the analog stick, and keep control of multi-man parties all at the same time. It's a seriously daunting task, and with no A.I. to speak of for your supporting characters, one that needs to be mastered if you wish to survive.   After several hours of practice (and one hell of a learning curve), the flexibility of so many choices will finally begin to reveal itself, and before you know it your allies will be cracking necks, hog-tying opponents, and finding interesting ways to infiltrate aircraft carriers and other such locales. It is a true strategy fan's playground, but one that cannot be truly experienced unless you're a veteran of such titles or your will is made of tempered steel.    And that's the real snag that will probably keep most players away: the challenge. An already difficult prospect even without the complex layout and similarly zonky button commands, the added frustration of trying to get your soldiers to do what you want them to could prove too much for Ritalin-deficient audiences. And that's just on the normal level; the other two resistance settings are absolutely nightmarish.   Unfortunately, I can't help but think that Pyro Studios did the best it could with the transition to console. Perhaps too complex for the non-PC world, Commandos 2 can't live up to its true potential without the aid of a keyboard and mouse (which sadly is not supported here).    Graphics  Commandos 2 is one of those common types of games that appears better in screenshots than when seen in motion. A lush, detail-heavy landscape party on the PC, the console version of  Men of Courage is just a step below. And while the backgrounds and surrounding objects are still above average in terms of quality and realism, the visual score is severely deflated by two distinct players: The camera and the characters.   Washed out and sometimes invisible, the flea-like human antagonists in the game are almost constantly camouflaged in outdoor arenas. So while they're easy to spot in doors or when underwater, the leafy green surroundings of a jungle can hide one of your alter egos from you better than it can the computer. Which means you'll be busy looking for one of your soldiers as the sharp Artificial Intelligence picks you off in the distance, tough breaks.   Additionally, the moveable camera can never decide if it wants to be smooth or if it wants to suddenly appear in its new direction. Unable to pinpoint exact situations that make the difference, holding R2 and pushing the right analog stick will sometimes effortlessly glide the view in a silky 360 rotation, while other times jerking along in a split second to a completely different 90 degree perspective. Odd and disorienting (especially in fire fights), the schizophrenic camera could have used some work.    Sound  Composer Mateo Pascual and his team have done a fabulous job of capturing the great military buddy feel from modern pictures like The Rock and Black Hawk Down. Piano heavy with a lot of beat, the thumping soundtrack is a real standout for those of us who like our military simulations with a hint of Hollywood.   The voices and sound effects match up pretty well, with the only real gripe falling in line with the same issue that PC reviewer Dan Adams had; the confirmation sounds. Repetitive and low on the variety, there's only so many times you can hear your guy say ~yes~ and ~hmm~ before scrambling for the mute button. Complaint aside, Men of Courage still sports a healthy dose of other sounds and vocals (complete with accents and personal touches), and does enough right to allow for an easy forgiveness with our only audible problem.Limited as it is with its controller-based input and lack of multiplayer functionality (an extra incentive for windows users last year), Commandos 2 still manages to stack up as a decent tactical strategy title. Nowhere near the level of quality the PC version offers in every major category, console-specific gamers who never experienced Men of Courage's older brother could be none the wiser.If you've played the Windows-based edition release last year however, or have a low tolerance for clunky control setups and incredibly challenging scenarios, then it'll probably be an easy task to look for entertainment elsewhere. A good solid ride for the brave and bold, but recommended only for true genre fans and non-PC gamers at that.", "date": "Sep 4, 2002"}
