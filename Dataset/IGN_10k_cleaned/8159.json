The law of averages suggests quite strongly that, whether by design or through sheer, ill-considered whoopsie-daisy, there'd be a good 3D Sonic game eventually. So, if you're one of the poor unfortunates that endured Sonic the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 - and, if you forked fifty quid out for you, we don't blame your dogged attempts at feeling like less of a plum - rejoice: your salvation is here.   Back-tracking slightly though, here's a quick history of Sonic the Hedgehog in three dimensions. Well, actually, let's just stick to Sonic Adventure on Dreamcast and pretend that none of the other unmitigated polygonal atrocities ever happened. It's no coincidence that Sonic's first high-speed 3D jaunt across tropical blue waters, careening through rock-carved hoops and dodging gigantic blue whales is firmly, joyously lodged in the memory banks of any gamer around at the time. That first level promised so much - a genuinely faithful transition from the sprites of yore into a new technological age, magnificently capturing the fast-paced, blistering excitement of the hedgehog's early MegaDrive appearances.    To this day, it's still a mystery then how Sonic Team managed to convince itself that those tedious fetch-quests hampering the rest of Sonic Adventure should be the bed-rock of all future Sonic games. It happened though - culminating, quite spectacularly, in one of the blandest, downright awful games ever to pop out of SEGA's sphincter. Yes, hello Sonic Xbox 360 and PS3.   Key to the success of Sonic and the Secret Rings is its development team understood what Sonic Adventure got so right all those years back and - cannily - designed an entire game around those singular, basic principles: speed and spectacle. As you're no doubt already aware, Secret Rings eschews the hackneyed, kitchen-sink approach to game design favoured in recent 3D Sonic titles, pairing the action right back to the hedgehog's roots. With the camera, finally, lodged firmly behind Sonic, Secret Rings is almost entirely an on-rails experience. At its simplest, you're given freedom to weave Sonic left and right as he careens along each level's set path, with jump and attack abilities thrown in to navigate obstacles and annihilate enemies.    Control-wise, Secret Rings plays a lot like Excite Truck. Holding the Wii Remote in horizontal position, tilting the controller left and right steers Sonic, while '2' performs a jump and '1' brings him to a screeching halt. In fact, similarities in set-up belie just how much closer to a racer Secret Rings plays, than a traditional platformer. A sensible move really, given that both racing and Sonic are all about speed, assessing and reacting to the route ahead and, obviously, reaching the finish line as fast as possible.   Initially, at least, that's all you're tasked with doing in Secret Rings. Each of the eight unlockable levels (including a boring but reluctantly useful tutorial), starts off with a frantic bout of sightseeing, designed to familiarise you with your surroundings and general layout of the course. Here, your goal is to get to the end as quickly as possible, experimenting with your various abilities in order to shave as many precious seconds off as possible. From there on in, you're constantly asked to return to each level to perform a range of different tasks - some easy, like killing 10 enemies, some hard, like racing against an AI opponent for first place - in order to progress though the game. While this might sound tedious, monotony is averted through some brilliant track design.     Areas are amazingly diverse, including Arabian sand dunes, prehistoric jungles and even pirate galleons in a raging sea storm. Best of all though, each is packed with minor details and character - sure, the Wii mightn't have the technical wizardy of its next-gen counterparts under its hood, but for our money Secret Rings wipes the floor with Sonic the Hedgehog on Xbox 360 and PS3 visually. What's more, each level is always expansive enough to accommodate a variety of routes. This means that although you might be asked to revisit each level multiple times, each challenge manages to spin familiar proceedings into something different enough to feel fresh every time. What's more, there's plenty of impetus to test your mettle in each tasks, thanks to an incredibly welcome levelling system.   Each successfully completed challenge earns you experience points, unlocking new tasks and abilities. In the latter case, there're almost one hundred moves to embellish Sonic's basic powers. Whether a quicker sidestep, speed boost or even an increased bolster from standing jump, each has a dramatic effect on the ease with which you can complete a level. In fact, certain abilities are absolute prerequisites if you're not going to get stuck midway through an area. Prior to undertaking a new challenge, you can equip one of four rings with a selection of these abilities - once you've purchased them with experience points. It's a brilliant way to increase your sense of achievement as you progress through the game, with Sonic gradually becoming a real force to be reckoned with.    Unfortunately, the downside to this is that, initially at least, proceedings are somewhat underwhelming, with little in the way of Sonic's trademark speed and agility to offer that traditional adrenaline hook. Sadly, that's not the only misstep that Secret Rings makes either. Levels, for all their brilliant touches - some of the set-pieces really have to be seen to be believed - occasionally fall foul of some appalling design idiocy.   Mostly, this can be attributed to the camera set-up which, admittedly very rarely, doesn't always give you the best view of upcoming obstacles. In these instances, you'll find yourself grinding to a complete standstill as you crash into a solid obstacle or, worse, plowing straight to your doom at the hands of an unseen enemy or hazard.    Occasionally too, it's possible to completely overshoot an opponent or trigger essential for progression. If this happens, you're left grappling with the clumsy back-step mechanic, slowly reversing into the camera in a bid to rectify your mistake and progress.   As a result, there's perhaps a little too much reliance on trial and error in Secret Rings and the resulting frustration factor might prove too much for some players. Although far from a deal breaker in our eyes, we're admittedly disappointed. With a little more attention during development, these minor issues could have been fixed, elevating Secret Rings from a good game to a great one. It's a shame when you consider how very close Sonic Team has gotten to finally encapsulating that old Sonic spirit in a 3D game this time around.These issues aside  well gloss over the appallingly incongruous angst-rock soundtrack and half-hearted multiplayer party game mode, largely out of generosity  theres no doubt that SEGAs almost nailed it with Sonic and the Secret Rings. By taking the hedgehog back to his routes  with emphasis now firmly on speed and skill, as it should have been all along - Secret Rings is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable Sonic titles to grace consoles since sprites were the height of fashion. Despite some frustrating flaws, rearing their heads a little too often, Wii owners are in for a fast, fun treat. Here's hoping SEGA's taking notes for Sonic's inevitable next outing.", "date": "Mar 2, 2007"}
