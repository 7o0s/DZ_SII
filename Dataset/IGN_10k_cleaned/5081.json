Pirates! is only now coming in for a much needed revamp. However if you can't wait for Sid Meier and his mates to get the sequel sorted then Port Royale 2 is a reasonably seaworthy alternative which is another Pirates! in all but official name, as the main elements of the original game design are here.  Indeed the first Port Royale also did its best to emulate the brilliance of Pirates!, but somehow missed the mark with a few interface and design issues seeing the game confined to quarters until a few remedies could be found. Port Royale 2 is a much better balanced effort. The game is an evolutionary step forward with a few new elements and tweaks here and there.  In technology terms, Port Royale 2 is more 98 Oldsmobile than brand spanking new Acura sports coupe, as the visuals are effective but very spartan. The bulk of the game is presented using isometric 'pseudo 3D', with sprites and not a mind boggling level of detail. The ships are presented in 3D though, even if each boat boasts very few polygons.  There is plenty of color splashed about on screen and when you are in town each of the key characters you meet pops up in an animated window in the bottom right of the screen.  That said, this is never the sort of game you are going to want to use to show off your new graphics card to your friends. However, Port Royale 2 does still have the right stuff to keep more than a few of you stuck in front of your machine absorbed in the Machiavellian machinations of colonial politics and the struggle for economic dominance.   There is a lot you can do in this game and in sandbox mode the options are delightfully open indeed. You can engage in a little piracy, bounty hunting or in the simple processes of economic growth, trading, buying properties and setting up businesses. This latter option is actually the most involving, complex and challenging part of the game, as getting a handle on the various trading menus can take a little time.  That said, the trading system is quite elegant, even if it is also reasonably complex. You can buy units (in this case I presume they are tons) of various cargo types and you are given a reminder of what you paid for them with a figure which pops up on the margin of the trading table as you begin to buy or sell. Prices go up as you buy out a settlement's stockpile and you have to be careful not to purchase goods at too high a price.  Thankfully the system aggregates your purchase price, lowering or rasing your break-even price point depending on whether the cargo you are adding is more or less expensive than that of the same kind you already have on board. This makes trading quite easy as you sail into a port and check their buying price against your cargo cost. If it is higher, then matey boy it is time to make a deal with the land lubbers. If it is lower, then it is time to slink back out to sea like the scurvy dog you are.  Trading prices fluctuate a lot and you will also be able to keep tabs on critical shortages in settlements as the symbol of a particular item in dangerously short supply will pop up over a town's map icon from time to time. You can also have a real impact on pricing yourself, sending the price of a good up if you buy lots of it regularly, so you have to be judicious if you don't want to make things too expensive to resell. That said you can also drive prices up cornering the market so that you can make a killing with goods you produce. The trading menus are decent, but a 'sell all' button would have made it easier to move goods at times.  It would have also made sense if a cursor or arrow system was implemented that highlighted the instances when a profitable trade was on the cards when visiting a port. Instead you have to check the figures every time, which can get laborious.      Owning business is more a part of the game too, as you can own several businesses in different towns. You can even now have more than one convoy, which means you can go as nuts as you like when it comes to trading on the high seas. This makes the game far busier than the original, but owning several convoys can be a bit too involved at times. That said it is useful as you might have a more heavily armed convoy for dangerous jobs and then maintain a fleet of ships for less stressful missions too.  Fitting out your ships is really simple too, as you throw different cannon shot aboard as well as the cannon themselves and even small arms and cutlasses. There are three types of cannon shot, each with their own unique tactical advantages. The most basic big heavy balls are designed to sink ships by puncturing the hull, pure and simple. However sometimes you might wish to immobilise a ship first, rendering it helpless. The best ammunition for this is the chained shot which is really effective at tearing down sails and rigging. Finally you might want to capture a ship by boarding. This can be done by crashing into a ship any time during a battle, but it is wise to soften up your target first by firing grapeshot at the enemy vessel, as this form of ammunition kills crewmembers, while leaving the hostile vessel relatively unharmed. You can then capture a ship by boarding and sometimes you will just win with superior numbers and on other occasions you might have to challenge the captain to a duel.  The duelling system is pretty simple so don't expect Soul Calibur, but it works reasonably well all of the same. You just have to use the cursor to target your opponent and it is easier to strike successfully if you vary your regions of attack.   Naval combat is presented using an overhead 3D view and it works well all but for one minor issue. You can only elect to use one ship at a time as your convoy 'escort' even though you will be battling several enemy vessels. It doesn't matter that you have a fleet of twenty ships all armed to the teeth; you can only use them one at a time, while your enemy isn't constrained this way. This is annoying, even if it is understandable that the designers would have been struggling to put together a system for mass battles which saw you controlling several ships.  Either way naval warfare feels a little unbalanced for this reason, even if you can usually prevail by picking a reasonably manoeuvrable ship and by keeping upwind and crossing the bow of your enemy firing all of the way. The best sort of ship to use in this circumstance is a tooled up sloop or barque. The smallest and fastest ship, the pinnace, can also be very good at staying away from the enemy, but it is very small and easily taken down if your foe does get a few shots in.  Port Royale 2 offers more than a few missions as well as the free play mode and you will find the game is mighty absorbing, especially when a number of different nations begin to appear in the Caribbean. The game has a comprehensive tutorial too, although it is sometimes easy to break the script and find you have to start again because you didn't do what was asked of you in exactly the right order.  Port Royale 2 has a real '4am factor' to it as you continue to make one more voyage as you look to trade your goods to nearby towns for really solid profit. There are numerous distractions in town too, with an inn, the church and Governor's residence to visit. You can also do a spot of gambling, empty your warehouse, hit the treasurer up for a loan or even get married.   Port Royale 2 isn't the easiest of games to get into at first. Despite the low tech nature of the gameworld, the menus are many and complex, and sometimes everything isn't that well explained by the tutorial or the manual. Instead you just have to nut it out. That said, peaceful pursuits like trading, developing production facilities and keeping your allies well supplied and happy can take up a lot of time.  Like a carbuncle on the underside of your pinnace, this game grows on you the more you play it. This is a solid if unremarkable game. You will get a lot of out Port Royale 2 as long as you have a good eye for menus and details and plenty of patience. Port Royale 2 is engaging as it delivers a complex gameworld where your course of action is very open, giving the game good replay value as you can take different career paths each time you play.", "date": "Oct 6, 2004"}
