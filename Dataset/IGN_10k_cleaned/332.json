{"name": "Tom & Jerry", "name_review": "Tom & Jerry", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/20/tom-jerry", "text": "Majesco keeps cranking out those color ports of existing black-and-white games  this time, bringing the Hanna-Barbera  cat-and-mouse duo Tom and Jerry to the Game Boy Color in their more accurate hues. This is nothing more than a generic platform game, and a pretty redundant one at that. Features Ten levels One or two players (alternating) For Game Boy or Game Boy Color  It's not like you should be expecting anything special from a platform game starring licensed characters, but you really hope it would be something a little more ~special.~ In Tom and Jerry, you take control of Jerry the mouse and make him run from left to right collecting cheese, soda, and heart icons. Nowhere in the game does it say why you're doing this (the manual finally reveals that you're trying to find your cousin Tuffy), which is a good indication on the generic mechanics that await you in this game.  Jerry can run and jump, and if he collects a blue ball he can throw them at the dangerous obstacles. Tom makes an appearance throughout each of the game's levels, but he's usually just hiding in a trash can and pounces out when you get near it. The real threats are the spiked floors or the bottomless pits that you have to leap over and avoid.  What most makes this game annoying is the tediousness of the design  if you die, you start all the way back at the beginning of the level. And if you want to earn a password, you have to go through three entire levels before you're awarded the first one. This is kid friendly???  It took me four or five tries to get to the end of the first level and I was ready to call it quits. Just imagine what it'll take someone with less gaming experience, like a six year old (the obvious market for this game). Once you make it through all ten levels, you've finished the game  but I honestly can't see too many kids performing this task.  As far as generic platform games go, this one's a real stinker. The graphics are nice, the animation smooth...but the design just wasn't well thought-out. I can see kids throwing this one in a drawer after a day of play, wishing they got something else instead. Forget this game, gang. Pick up something a bit more worthwhile if you're into the whole running and jumping thing   like Super Mario DX.", "date": "Oct 20, 1999"}
