After stunning the world with last year's Tomb Raider, the two companies have been busy working on three new games, Tomb Raider 2, Ninja, and Fighting Force. Taking its cues from arcade titles like Final        Fight and Double Dragon, Fighting Force        is a 3D update of the classic 2D beat-em-up genre. However, like any game from this genre, it can get a little repetitious.         Take control of one of four characters -- Mace        Daniels, Hawk Mason, Ben (Smasher)        Jackson, or Alana McKendrick -- and pummel        your way through 25 3D polygonal worlds. Each sub-level serves as a fighting arena of sorts, and closes off until all of your opponents are killed. The most impressive aspect of these arenas is the level of interactivity you have with your surroundings. Pretty much everything not nailed down can be used as a weapon, from ash trays to boxes to car tires.  Fighting Force's strength, however, lies in the control. Most 3D games of this type so far have been near impossible to control -- even getting your character to face the adversary was an exercise in frustration. Not so with Fighting Force, as control is as basic and intuitive as it gets. The majority of the action is made up of punching and kicking, although combos and throws are also popular.  Fighting Force's major drawback, however, is its lack of variety. After a few levels of repeatedly punching and kicking the same villains, it does get a little tired. The two-player cooperative mode does alleviate this some, but still doesn't change the fact that you can only attack one opponent at a time, unless you use the character's super move, but this drains your health.  With solid graphics, impeccable control, yet almost zero innovation or variety, Fighting Force is a rmixed bag. If in doubt, rent before you buy.", "date": "Nov 4, 1997"}
