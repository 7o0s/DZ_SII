That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.  Myst is the best selling computer game ever.  Everyone has heard of it.  Even your grandma in Wisconsin has heard of it.  If you try to talk to a stranger sitting beside you on an airplane about Bungie's real time strategy game, Myth, the stranger will nod as if he knows what you're talking about because he thinks you mean Myst.    I, however, had never played Myst.  I am an adventure game fan and I had played Riven.  I used to think I was the gaming world equivalent of a movie critic who has seen The Godfather II without having seen The Godfather.  But then I played Myst, which is no Godfather, and realized it's not an appropriate metaphor.    I'm sure Myst was mind blowing when it came out.  Adventure gamers were grateful to have something more colorful than an Infocom text parser, so they were enjoying Al Lowe's penis jokes and Roberta Williams' cartoon princesses.  All of a sudden here comes this eerie but relaxed romp through a place that looked realistic except for the fact that it's surreal.  Somewhere along the way Myst and CD-ROMs forged a symbiotic relationship: Myst was the killer app that sold CD-ROMs and CD-ROMs were the only way you could play this weird new game you were hearing about.  But going back to Myst now is kind of like watching hit TV shows from the 70s.  ~People watched that?,~ you wonder in horror.  But then you realize that Happy Days and Mork & Mindy were all they had back then.  After a decade of stuff like The Larry Sanders Show, The Simpsons, and Frasier, of course 70s sitcoms look insipid.  So it is with Myst.  Up against the sort of adventure games you can play today -- Grim Fandango, The Last Express, Sanitarium, even the Gabriel Knight series -- Myst really doesn't hold up very well.  The technology is a big part of the problem.  8-bit static artwork at 640x480 resolution does not look good these days on anything bigger than a 14~ monitor (don't be fooled by the screenshots).  Games like Diablo and Majesty can get away with coarse resolutions because they have deeper color depth and lively character animation.  But it really limits how much Cyan can do with the scenery, which is 90% of what you're staring at when you're playing Myst.  Unless you intend to have a sky with the texture of sandpaper, you really can't use the words ~photo-realism~ and ~8-bit~ in the same sentence anymore.    This is not to say Myst isn't gorgeous.  It is.  Cyan has a phenomenal artistic vision that is equal parts Victorian London, South Seas tropical paradise, Yes album cover, and Leonardo DaVinci's workshop.  But decade-old graphics technology doesn't do it justice.  The alien worlds in titles like Battlezone 2, Outcast, and MDK2 certainly don't have the creative splendor of Myst, but they look better by virtue of how quickly we've come so far with computer game graphics.  The sound in Myst deserves special mention because it's a rare example of how less is more.  The ambient noise won't grate on your nerves when you get stuck on a puzzle and have to listen to it over and over.  It also stays sufficiently in the background so that when something happens -- a tower rotates, a page is added to a linking book, or a cave floods -- you'll know it.  The music is just an occasional new age-y riff, but it works because it's haunting without being overbearing.  It's actually catchy in a Yanni meets Tangerine Dream kind of way.  Another instance of how less is more is the way Cyan used video clips.  They were, of course, limited by relatively primitive computer support for video playback, but this ends up being one of Myst's inadvertent strengths.  Over the course of the game, you discover two brothers trapped inside separate books.  Through windows the size of postage stamps, you catch glimpses of their faces fading in and out through static.  You can hear fragments of what they're saying, as if you're trying to tune a short-wave radio, but can't quite hit the right frequency.  As you recover missing pages for each book, they start coming in clearer.  It's eerie hearing these voices, especially since Myst is set in a bright and often cheery isolated world without people; you are alone in the sun, until you flip back the cover of one of a book and suddenly someone strange fellow is talking at you.  The creators of the game, brothers Rand and Robyn Miller, play the brothers in the game.  Rand Miller is especially amusing as the sniveling and twitchy Achenar.  Robyn Miller isn't awful until the endgame movie, at which point he is positively cringe inducing.  But when the game finally winds down and the video is played without interference, it makes for an incredibly disappointing conclusion.  One of Myst's endings has you trapped for all of eternity with an unresponsive video clip; apparently Hell is digitized video of other people who won't talk to you.  A final act that should have assumed the proportions of Greek tragedy is reduced to a resigned sigh.  But these video clips early in the game serve their purpose admirably.  You slog through the contrived puzzles to hear more about who these strange people are and why they're trapped.  It's almost a compelling incentive to solve the game.  Almost.  Unfortunately, those damn puzzles are in the way.  While I appreciate Cyan's artistic vision, I hope no one lets them make any more puzzles.  I would almost rather fumble through a Jane Jensen puzzle involving mimes or cat fur and syrup than face the equivalent of that friggin' tone matching puzzle in the space ship.  If you've played Myst, you know the one I mean.  In the history of bad ideas, it deserves a place alongside a stronger Germany military, New Coke, and solo Yoko Ono albums.  This is by far the game's worst puzzle -- it requires listening to a specific tone, then clicking across a couple of screens and reproducing it exactly from a spectrum of about 40 musical notes.  Do this for each tone in a five tone series until you get it exactly right.  When you don't get it exactly right, you have no way of knowing which tone you got wrong.  If you don't have perfect pitch and neurosurgical precision with the mouse, expect to be staring at this screen at least through next Christmas.  There are other puzzles almost as bad.  There's a tedious repetitive underground maze, secret doors that are virtually impossible to find unless you happen to click on them, and areas that you would have no idea you could reach.  Since it's not always clear how much the fixed perspective is moving when you turn, it's difficult to tell where you're going in places like Channelwood or the forest on Myst Island.  Have you spun 180 degrees or are you just looking a little to the left?  It makes it almost impossible to follow a map, much less make one.  The structure of Myst is such that you begin the game faced with nearly a half dozen puzzles to solve in any order you want.  It offers a great opportunity to explore and play with devices at your leisure until clues start falling together.  Unfortunately, some of the puzzles shunt you off into another world, where you're stuck with no idea of what to do.  The hub of Myst is crammed with clues and doo-dads, but the four Ages that run like spokes from Myst Island usually bring the game to a screeching halt.  There's no more sense of the playful exploration you enjoyed on Myst Island.  You can't bring the clues with you and you can't jump back and forth between them because of the way games are saved.  There is no ingame provision to record important information or diagrams, so you have to take notes and copy pictures, all of which are kept in one library rather than doled out over the course of the game.  Instead, you get to spend an hour or so sitting in the library wading through stilted prose and playing scribe whenever you come across a diagram.  It's like being in school again.  And this is ultimately why Myst isn't as good as I hoped it would be.  Ten years ago, game designers had a lot to learn about that difficult line between fun and frustration, the elusive fulcrum on which you balance the desire to throw the game out the window and the ennui of clicking through the motions.  Cyan hadn't quite gotten it right.    -- Tom ChickComment on this story Presentation  An excellent bleed-in intro leads to one of the most seamless interfaces ever.  Your mouse pointer is your hand.  Period.  That's the whole interface.   8.0  Graphics  Beautiful artwork betrayed by old technology.  It's very sad, actually.    5.0  Sound  Sound designers should take a cue from Myst's muted conservation of sound.  Every noise and musical note is rare and precious.   9.0  Gameplay  The few truly excellent puzzles are ruined by the few truly awful puzzles.  And you remember the awful puzzles because you spent more time on them.   3.0  Lasting Appeal  Myst is a one-time experience, although the nature of the game forces you to play through each Age twice if you want to see all the possible conclusions.   2.0  Should I Go Back and Play It?  There are far better adventure games to spend your time on.   NO  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   5.0 Myst may be the best selling game ever, but try asking the next person who has heard of Myst whether he finished it and here's what you're likely to hear: ~You know, I never did get past that one really hard part, so I stopped playing~.  Would that I could say the same.", "date": "Aug 1, 2000"}
