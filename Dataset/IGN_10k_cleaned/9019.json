This month, Electronic Arts is presenting Tony Hawk with his biggest challenge yet, the simply-named Skate. And naturally, EA Mobile has prepped a mobile edition to support your boarding habit on-the-go.   Skate follows your career as a no-name skater wanting to reach the big leagues, represented here as the cover of Thrasher magazine. On your quest to be the cover boy, you must impress other skaters, photographers, and pick up sponsors. Each objective is met by completing a set of small, bite-sized missions, such as scoring a certain number of points, picking up an item lost in an area, or stringing together a line of tricks or grinds.   So far, this doesn't sound all that different from Tony Hawk, right? The control scheme and level design makes all the difference here. Skate employs essentially a one-thumb approach, allowing players with a casual bent to get into the game. By pressing left or right, you start moving your skater through the level. Holding and releasing OK ollies into the air. In the air, you can either drop down on a rail and grind or perform amid-air trick, like a 360. To string tricks together, you press left or right quickly to start what's called a ~manual.~ Manuals keep a trick line going, even if you're not near a grind or jump. You just have to remember to keep your balance.   Skate takes plan in a fictional metropolis that is full of rails, pipes, benches, and walls. There is no shortage of things to jump off of or grind along. The levels stretch horizontally and vertically. While skating along, you'll spot the edge of a jump or a wall in the corner of the screen, cueing you to investigate further. I really liked this element of exploration, especially since finding additional spots in each level usually lead to discovering better routes to line up tricks.   I also really liked the pacing -- no mission in Skate takes more than a couple of minutes to complete. This is great mobile design, allowing you to pop in and out of the game at your leisure. The learning curve is also good. You're eased into the trick system before the game starts asking for bigger things, like heavy point totals.   Skate looked great on my LG VX8600 (Verizon). It's a 2D game with solid animation and good color choices. The overall presentation is nice, thanks to smart menus that make it a breeze to get in, get out, and keep moving. The music is fine and I liked the sound effects -- it sounds like EA Mobile sampled some real skateboarding and put it in the game.It's strange -- even though Skate focuses on a slightly more realistic skating experience than the Tony Hawk mobile games, it's actually a more accessible game. Save for activating your slo-mo footie time, it's pretty much a one-thumb game. Complete with lots of challenges, some big environments to explore, and great visuals, Skate is the best mobile skateboarder on the decks right now.", "date": "Sep 12, 2007"}
