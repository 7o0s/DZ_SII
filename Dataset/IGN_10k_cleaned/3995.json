Countless gamers have been enslaved by its simple and addictive bubble-popping action. This addiction hits home here at the IGN office, as many of us have had to intervene in the lives of friends and family members, in order to slowly wean them from the claws of that seemingly innocent green dinosaur.   Now as the N-Gage version of the classic puzzle game is released, a new threat rises. But will this (shuttering at the thought of Puzzle Bobble junkies roaming the streets like zombies with N-Gages in front of their faces) mobile version of Puzzle Bobble have the same potency as the arcade and home console versions had to keep puzzle fans hooked? Read on.  Features  one or two players BlueTooth support Bubble popping action   Gameplay Those concerned by the thought of a loved-one carelessly wandering the streets with Puzzle Bobble VS in hand should be less concerned about their gaming addition and more concerned about the their eyesight. While it may seem difficult to ruin the simple gameplay of Puzzle Bobble, the N-Gage version has lost almost all of the redeeming attributes that we have come to expect from the series.   First and foremost, certain bubbles in Puzzle Bobble VS are virtually indistinguishable from one another. Blue, dark green, purple, and black bubbles are only separated after much eye straining and squinting. What is the point in playing a game where the goal is to match up bubbles of the same color if you can't tell them apart?  Puzzle Bobble VS' second flaw is its maddeningly slow pace. Maybe the intention was to slow gameplay down just enough to give players time to labor over distinguishing colors. Puzzle Bobble was meant to be played as fast as the player could think, but with Puzzle Bobble VS the game moves so slow that by the time the bubble reaches its target and a new one is loaded, you would have wasted the time you should have used to load another game into your N-Gage.   The one redeeming quality (if you can get past the glaring problems) in Puzzle Bobble VS is, you guessed it, the versus mode. Gameplay doesn't magically improve, and the bubble colors don't suddenly take on a higher contrast, but you can challenge a friend to a slow and methodical versus match. Again this only applies if you have super human vision and timeless patience.  Graphics The Puzzle Bobble series has never produced graphical showpieces, and the N-Gage version follows in suit. Besides from the maddeningly similar bubble colors, Puzzle Bobble VS has all the overly cute characters, serene backgrounds, and colorful world map (complete with numerous rainbows) we've come to expect. Strangely enough, Puzzle Bobble VS features short 3D animations of the characters between levels. Whether it was to tease us with the N-Gage's 3D capabilities, or to shock us by adding something good (yes, we actually used the word ~good~ in the review) remains to be seen.  Sound Puzzle Bobble VS scrapes the bottom of the barrel in the sound department. Only a few simple tinny sound effects punctuate the bubble popping, and music is virtually non-existent. It's time to start taking advantage of the ability to listen to the radio while playing games on the N-Gage.It's a shame that Puzzle Bobble VS turned out the way it did, because it would have been a great addition to the N-Gage library if it had resembled the popular arcade version. In the end, we can't bring ourselves to even recommend it as a rental; it's much too frustrating (and eye-straining) to subject others to its blur of near identical bubbles, and snore-inducing pace. Stay away, for your optometrist's sake.", "date": "Oct 9, 2003"}
