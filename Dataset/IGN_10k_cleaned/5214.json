That said, I have yet to see any physical program called ~Tak~ on the cable station despite his appearance in not just one, but now two original, Nickelodeon-branded videogames from THQ. This witchdoctor-like character must have a hidden following to justify a second go-round on the Game Boy Advance, because his original outing last year was, to be blunt, bland and forgettable. His recently released portable sequel had a bit more attention paid to its design, but once again this guy's GBA outing just lacks any sort of creative spark and barely does anything to set itself apart as a unique platformer. Features Nine environments Cartridge save (one slot)  For the sequel to last year's Tak and the Power of Juju, THQ hit up its GBA developer Helix to update what it created for last year's game. At the very least, the team didn't cheap out like in several GBA sequels; Tak 2 is a completely original game developed from the ground up. It's a much more fleshed out design with far more levels and techniques than there were in the original Tak, but there's so many gaps in the game's layout that the structure is nearly ruined in the process. So, while it's safe to say that it's better than the original, the bar was already set pretty low with Tak and doesn't really shoot much higher. Tak 2 is, once again a very routine, uninspired and ~safe~ action platformer design that looks nice but plays very ho-hum. Many ideas that gamers take for granted in most every platformer out there have been restricted as limited special abilities in Tak 2 Players have to manage a Juju meter in order to perform skills that would be the standard techniques in other action games. A double jump or a ground stomp, typical moves that are a dime a dozen in other titles, annoyingly requires a significant amount of Juju power, and they can't be pulled off if the player doesn't have any stored up. Early on this management is a real drag since it's never made clear where the heck Juju can be regularly collected. But once players figure the techniques to replenish the meter, it's not all that hard to keep the Juju meter brimming.  The level designers attempt to create a sense of exploration with the Dream Energy element, but even here there's really no point. The idea is to locate little speckles of pixiedust-like particles hovering in the air, which indicate ~hidden~ platforms that will either take players to the next part of the world, or lead a trail to some previously inaccessible orbs that can be collected for goods outside of the game. But once players figure out that there's a readily available mini-game that's incredibly easy to exploit to win dozens of these orbs in a single shot, there's really no point in straying from the level's standard path to collect these orbs. Which turns Tak 2 levels into a mindless Point A to B challenge that's definitely lacks the ~challenging~ part.  The balance of difficulty is also all over the place. On the one hand, an enemy hit on Tak barely takes a scraping off the power-bar, which makes it pretty easy to keep Tak in tip-top fighting condition. Even when he gets low on energy, replenishment is only a icon pick-up away...or players can keep him stocked up in the optional inventory by spending some orbs for potions on the level select screen. But then, these guys throw in instant-death elements that are incredibly frustrating; most individual levels are three or four ~sublevels~ big, but when players die in the very last portion of the level, it's right back to the start. And that's where the instant-death issues seem entirely unfair and downright irritating. The overall game experience does have some merit, with some tricky ~puzzle~ elements that require more than the standard jump-and-run gameplay. So it's not all terrible. But Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams does nothing to stick its head out higher than the rest of the platform crowd beyond giving players another ~Tak~-branded Game Boy Advance game. But since I can't recall anything but Tak-branded games, I can't imagine he's all that coveted a property to begin with.", "date": "Nov 4, 2004"}
