What do you do about it today?   Answer: Make a videogame, of course!   Most gamers are unlikely to have seen The Great Escape (unless there are more Steve McQueen fans than we thought), so the appeal of the movie license may have little to no impact at all for the game. But having seen the movie is not necessarily a requirement since the movie's plot is delivered through FMVs and by your in-game actions. But is The Great Escape a game worthy of not only its movie license, but of the fabulous Steve McQueen? Well, that all depends on how much you like The Great Escape film.  Stealth is the name of the game, most of the time. A typical mission consists of sneaking around, reaching an objective point, then heading to a new objective point. Sometimes these objectives are hidden under a mask of details to make them seem more exciting than they are, but it's plainly obvious that the gameplay rarely changes. One of the biggest problems with the stealth aspects of The Great Escape is the fact that there's no explicit way to determine how hidden you are. Hiding in the shadows is supposed to help, as does keeping your distance from enemies, but oftentimes when you think you are in the clear, enemies spot you. Maybe it's more realistic, but this is a game, and certain measures need to be taken to ensure that the gameplay is balanced and fun.  But the entire game is not stealth-based. There are some more action-like scenes, as well as instances that involve vehicular transportation. Whenever the situation calls for shooting and blowing things up, the game is a bit more bearable, but the surface enjoyment quickly fades. As for driving trucks or motorcycles, or even manning a gun in an airplane, the controls come in and ruin the day. The feel behind the wheels just doesn't feel right and maneuvering around becomes an exercise in frustration. This makes recreating some of the more exciting scenes from the movie a lot less, um, exciting.  The way each mission begins is with an FMV cinema. Certain plot elements are revealed, and it's your job to complete the goals at hand. And while stealing an ID from a guard, getting it copied, and then returning it may sound tense and adventurous, those feelings are never there. The pacing of each mission feels off, and being a game based on a movie, you'd think some attention would be paid to how each mission plays out. A good movie is logically and evenly paced, a game, movie license or not, should capture that same balance. Unfortunately, The Great Escape does not.  Then there comes the AI. With a game structure and design like the one in The Great Escape, a good AI system should be implemented. While you're sneaking around camps, stealing vehicles, and infiltrating depots, if the enemies are either too stupid or inhumanly smart, what's the point, right? There is a situation in the game where you can sneak up behind a guard and strangle him. Walking clearly in his peripheral vision was not a problem. Then, punching, and then missing, did nothing to alert the guard to our presence. Other times, the extreme opposite would be true. Not good. Not good at all.   So is the The Great Escape a terrible game? Well, it definitely has its share of problems. But, it does have certain features going for it, namely the movie license and the scenarios in general. Big fans of the movie may get a kick out of the game and might be able to look past its more glaring issues. Also, for that group of gamers that always wanted to play P.O.W. but didn't have the chance, The Great Escape offers up similar gameplay.   Now here's a game with an odd look to it; the character models look almost like caricatures of their real life counterparts, complete with awkward animations. The lifeless stares, bulky bodies, and seamed joints only add to the character's ventriloquist doll-like appearances. Still, the look may appeal to some, especially those fond of the original film. There is some humor to be found in it, anyway. Aside from the slightly clumsy models and animations, textures and lighting are relatively decent, though far from spectacular.   Being based on a movie, you'd be correct to assume that there are quite a bit of voiced cinemas. Fortunately, the quality of the voice acting is better than a good number of games. We're not talking Oscar-worthy performances, but the lines are delivered with just enough confidence and camp that they help to increase immersion, rather than become a distracting nuisance.   The music in The Great Escape is on the same page as the voice acting; it's good enough to affect the game in beneficial ways rather than negative ones. From patriotic anthems to bouncy, ~sneaking~ music, The Great Escape features a competent soundtrack, spatial positioning and all. Don't expect to be blown away, but at least you won't have to worry about your hearing the next day. The Great Escape feels unfinished and thrown together. Some more time and thought could have made this game great, but as is, it's just not enough. A shame too since the movie license has so much potential as a videogame. Fans of the movie may find something to like here, but that's about it.", "date": "Aug 5, 2003"}
