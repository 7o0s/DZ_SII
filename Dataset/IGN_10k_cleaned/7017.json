Though it's hardly poised to overtake World War 2 as the industry's most overused setting, we're seeing more and more games based on our Latin-speaking ancestors. This year alone, there are three different city building games based on the Eternal City -- Tilted Mill's Caesar IV, Firaxis and Firefly's CivCity: Rome and Haemimont's Glory of the Roman Empire.  Haemimont's game is first out of the gate with a very traditional design that's relatively free of both complexity and challenge. Built on the same principles as games like SimCity, Settlers and the Impressions city games, Glory of the Roman Empire tasks players with a variety of city planning missions throughout the Empire, from Cartagena to Londonium, from Cologne to Syracuse.   Each city offers unique challenges -- some provide bonus resources, some are susceptible to plagues or barbarian attacks -- so you'll learn how to manage a variety of situations. Completing certain missions in a city will open up challenges in other cities so, while the game is relatively linear, there are plenty of opportunities to shuffle the missions around a bit.  Since you'll find yourself coming back to certain cities to complete new objectives, you're encouraged to build balanced settlements rather than simply rushing towards the goal at the expense of your city's overall well-being. One particularly notable sequence of missions has you running back and forth completing competing projects in neighboring cities. One builds a theater, so the other has to build an academy, then the first city responds by building a coliseum. It's a great way to build a player's connection in their work while still giving them a bit of variety.  In addition to the 30-mission campaign, there are a variety of sandbox maps, of varying levels of difficulty. The truly ambitious player can undertake a special four-mission challenge offered by Caesar himself. There's no multiplayer to speak of here beyond a simple online score comparison, but the replayability of the missions should encourage players to undertake the same challenges in new ways.   Everything in the game revolves around the houses. Without enough houses, your industries have no employees. The citizens serve as the basis of your workforce and you'll need to make sure they're close to the places they work and are served by a variety of services. You'll need to balance out the citizens by purchasing an equivalent number of slaves. While the freemen work in your city's businesses, the slaves will be put to work carting resources around and constructing new buildings.  Managing the placement of buildings so that they have access to all the necessary services is one of the main goals of the game. Each building has an area of influence that will determine how far the building's residents or employees are willing to travel to collect and deliver goods. Your butcher shops need to be close enough to your pig farms, for instance, to collect the meat required to make sausages. Your citizens' houses need to be close enough to a butcher shop in order to get food for their families. When you place or select a building, you'll see the radius that it influences, so you'll be able to understand why things are or aren't working. You can extend the influence of some buildings by building certain supporting structure. Slaves can transfer goods from one warehouse to another, while taverns and marketplaces let you redistribute food to your people.      Still, though you can use the warehouses and taverns to redistribute certain resources, you'll have to design most of your neighborhoods as self-sufficient units. At a minimum they'll all need taverns, prefectures, altars and wells. That's just for the bare subsistence level, which simply isn't going to cut it in the game's later stages. Eventually you'll need to supplement your neighborhoods with butchers, bakers, tailors as well as buildings that support the status and recreation of the upper class. Trying to pack in temples, gardens, statues, theaters and the like creates a real problem of space, particularly when you start to try to get the influence rings matched up. Since houses provide the labor for your industries, you'll find that every area you build in has to have some sort of residential support.   There's also a slight military element to the game. Players will have to fend off attacks by placing watchtowers along their borders and can even create limited army units from barracks. While it adds another dimension to the game, it's very peripheral to the overall experience and doesn't even start to appear until the final third of the campaign. Even then, the fighting is largely out of your hands, much as it was in the Impressions games.   While the basic challenge of the game is easy to appreciate, the level of challenge seems a bit low. Only once did I find myself failing badly enough to restart a particular mission and that was more through some mismanaged experimentation than from any pressure within the game's design. As such, the missions in Glory of the Roman Empire seem a bit easier to manage than those in other city-building games. Players looking for a serious challenge will likely be put off by the straightforward goals here, but casual players may find it to be the perfect introduction to the more difficult concepts the genre is known for.  Veterans are likely to be disappointed that there's so little interplay and complexity between the various structures and commodities in the game. Sure, it's nice that wheat can feed slaves and be sent to the baker to be made into bread to feed your citizens, that's the whole story for wheat. Some resources are even simpler. Gold doesn't come from taxing your citizens but is simply mined or, much later in the game, generated by marketplaces and taverns. Just build an olive or grape orchard and you'll start producing oil and wine. Sure, it's nice not to have to worry about fitting olive presses and wineries into your plan, but it makes the game feel a bit unimaginative.   Worse still, besides the fact that fire departments are called prefectures, the Roman flavor of the game seems a bit bland. The togas and baths and aqueducts keep the game from being totally generic but I really wish the game had included more Roman-themed structures. The addition of things like forums and gladiator schools would go a long way towards reminding the player that the game is supposed to simulate life in a Roman city. On the plus side, I'm really happy that the game doesn't shy away from including slaves as part of the city's infrastructure.  The interface is remarkably convenient but it still doesn't allow for completely free designs. The game uses the mouse both to control the camera and to access a radial menu for building, so you can play the game without ever touching the keyboard. Camera controls are intuitive and the building groupings make it easy to access whatever buildings you desire with a minimum of clicks.      The menu shows you what resources are required to build your structures so you won't have to guess whether or not you're prepared to undertake a project. Unlike most city games, you won't pay for buildings upfront. Placing the plan on the ground is completely free. At that point, your slaves will begin bringing in the materials needed to finish the building. You'll be able to see how many resources are on site already and how many are stored throughout your city. Many of these resources are actually required for regular maintenance of your buildings as well, so you can't just shut down your clay pits because you're done building new structures and need to employ the clay workers elsewhere.   Unfortunately, everything in the game can only be rotated in increments of 45 degrees. While it makes for some regimented, orderly city plans, it lacks the more open feeling of the villages in games like Black & White 2. Being able to design with curves would definitely make it easier to utilize your space more efficiently, particularly where roads and aqueducts are concerned. Being locked into the 45-degree scheme means you'll be stuck with a bit of wasted space and some awkward intersections.  The graphics certainly look good though. The buildings have a slightly stylized look to them that adds a lot of character to the game. Some might prefer more realistic graphics but there's so much more charm and personality here, both in the designs and color choices. It can take a while before you're used to identifying buildings by appearance alone but the different designs are pleasant and stand up to close inspection. Lights start to burn in the windows as day turns in to night.   There's not much variety among your citizens but it is nice to see some specific animations. Watching your people ply their various trades or worship at the temple definitely adds a bit of life to the game. Your citizens will break rocks at the quarry, clamor for bread at the warehouses, and the sick ones will even pause in the middle of their errands and start coughing in the streets.  All the charm of the visuals is supported by the game's sound design. The music is nicely understated, lying comfortably in the background and never demanding your attention. The various effects in the game add lots of life. Birds chirp in the trees, water laps at the shores and fire crackles as it spreads from building to building. Overall, the sound design is very convincing.Glory of the Roman Empire isn't quite as glorious as its name implies. The slightly generic nature of the design and the lack of challenge here make the game ideal for beginners but it doesn't quite satisfy players who are looking for the type of satisfaction they can only get from tougher challenges. In that way, it's the perfect game to introduce players to the genre but one they'll quickly outgrow.Veterans who stick with the game will definitely be rewarded with some charming and memorable moments but they may be better off holding out to see how the other Roman city games shape up later this year.", "date": "Jun 22, 2006"}
