There's a reason why it was so wide-spread in its distribution, aside from the fact that software piracy was spreading quicker than a fire over a pile of Halloween costumes  it was an absolute blast to play. It mixed small puzzle elements in a basic platform type game that predated Mario on the NES by a couple of years. And if you missed out on the game more than a decade and a half ago, you can get a decent idea of what the game was like in a remake from Take 2 titled Montezuma's Return. It's not a direct translation, but the essence is still here  and the game can still hold its own, especially in the Game Boy Color line-up. Features 150 screens Password save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   To bring this classic back to life on the Game Boy Color, Take 2 recruited the help of its stand-by Game Boy developer, Tarantula Studios. Now, Tarantula has had their fair share of stinkers in the past (Evel Kneivel and Grand Theft Auto are defining stinkers in the Game Boy library), but the team's job on this classic is top-notch. The group took the elements of the original game, built around them and created a game that feels both new and classic at the same time.  The game is built off the original design where you're a simple Aztec explorer out to uncover some serious booty. The only skills you've got are your wits and a jumping ability  the rest are acquired along the way. The game is split into 150 screens where you'll have to find keys to unlock doors that access the deeper chambers. Each screen is really a simple puzzle where you have to figure a way to grab the treasure and get the heck out before the nasty bad guys get you. Rolling skulls, spikes, ancient Aztec guards, spiders, snakes, and scorpions have been strategically placed to make getting through each chamber not an easy task. Levels have been constructed of platforms (both solid and periodically disappearing), ropes, ladders, and fireman poles, and you'll have to learn how your character reacts to each of these things in order to go from one chamber to the next.  You've only got five lives to get through to the save point (a password option is offered in certain points of the game), so dying really isn't an option. To help you along the way, you'll pick up power-ups that will let you walk through enemies or touch one to destroy it. Problem is, your guy is kind of a glass jaw  if he falls from too high a point (meaning higher than his height), touches an enemy, spikes or fire, he's dead. The game is definitely not easy, and it borders on nearly-frustrating since you'll have to pull off a few trial-and-error moves to figure out if your character can make the fall from one point to the next.  And if you're looking for a direct translation of the classic game, you're not going to get it  while some levels are fully designed exactly around the original 8-bit version of Montezuma's Revenge, most are unique levels structured unlike anything in the first game. The designers also zoomed the camera in so you can see more detail, forcing the game into a scrolling interface. The original game featured no scrolling, and each chamber fit on the full screen  I'd much rather have it the original way, since you can see how the level is arranged up front, instead of going into each chamber blindly.  I'm impressed with how well the remake has come out on the Game Boy Color, considering the source of the game's track record on the system. It seems that a classic can really shine on the trusty Nintendo handheld, even when it's been designed a bit different than the original. It's a great game that has a few gameplay issues, but all in all I'm very satisfied with how the conversion came out. It'll last you quite a while from start to finish.", "date": "Mar 21, 2000"}
