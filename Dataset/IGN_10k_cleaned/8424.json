Starring in yearly sequels, each one finding more new fans than the last. Capcom had found a winning formula, taking its blue-suited robot hero with a blaster for an arm and simply giving him new sets of foes to fight, again and again. And, by 1991, other companies were finally taking notice.   Shockman is one of those other companies' responses. Published in '91 on the TurboGrafx, it's a side-scrolling platformer/shooter that takes clear and liberal inspiration from Capcom's successful Mega Man series  but misses out on all the fun. This may be a close knock-off of the original Blue Bomber, but you'd be better off just waiting for the real thing to arrive on the VC. Shockman is a bust.        It's not for lack of trying.  Shockman puts you in the shoes of one of two selectable heroes, Arnold or Sonya. They're both young, school-age, happy-go-lucky kids who happen to be cyborgs and moonlight as robotic superheroes. From the start, then, there's something distinct here  Capcom never let you select to play as Mega Woman, after all  and there's the added ability to play two-player co-op, with you and a friend controlling both Arnold and Sonya simultaneously.   But that's about it for the positives. The promise of a Mega Man-esque action experience with two players active at once is intriguing, but quickly drowned out by a lack of creativity in each of the game's other areas. Enemy design is boring, or derivative  you face off against faceless foes with little personality, or random, organic alien things that don't mesh with their low-level mechanical minions. Arnold and Sonya's abilities are warmed over  just like Mega Man, they can fire small shots or charge their arm cannons to release larger bursts. And play control is poor, and frustrating to handle. Gamers who love this genre live and die by their ability to precisely guide the on-screen hero  here, it's not nearly as smooth as it should be.   Shockman tries to mix things up by altering the play style every couple of levels, transforming the hero into a kind of starship and recasting the whole experience as a forced-scrolling shooter. The Wii VC is already vastly overpopulated with games of this ilk, though, and by comparison these diversions in Shockman just can't compete.Shockman came to the US out of context. It was originally a game called Kaizou Choujin Schbibinman 2 in Japan, the sequel to a much more original and interesting 1989 Turbo title. The first Schbibinman had the same two-player co-op that this follow-up features, but also had better action. The characters had swords instead of blasters. The stages were laid out on a map screen, letting you choose your own order of progression from level to level. The presentation was much more humorous, and didn't take itself so seriously. Shockman lost all of that. This is an example of a game that lost its way, because it tried to copy the success of another company's franchise instead of continuing to build on its own, established, unique qualities. What resulted is a bust, a game that is just plain boring and not worth your 600 Points at all. Shockman serves one purpose  to make us wonder when the real Blue Bomber will arrive here on the Virtual Console. Save your money and wait for that day. You're not missing anything here.", "date": "May 1, 2007"}
