In fact, the best strategy games tend to reduce the variety of real life factors down to a few key concepts that capture the essence of battle. But there's a risk of oversimplifying things to the point that the action of the game seems to have nothing to do with reality. Lords of the Realm 3 dances on this line, offering a nice range of features but presenting them in a format that crosses from the realm of refined essentials to the realm of the arbitrary and overly abstract.    As such, it's best understood as an arcade-like answer to Activision's Medieval Total War. It offers the high-level strategic game where you manage your entire realm-- appointing knights, priests, burghers and serfs as the stewards of your various parcels of land. Directly or indirectly, these vassals provide the resources that you need to run your war machine. The other half of the game involves leading your armies on the fields of battle. A real-time, simultaneous format adds a bit of pressure here as you switch back and forth between separate battles and maintain control of your kingdom.   Being a king, you'll have to have enough armies to protect your kingdom and, hopefully, to expand into neighboring territories. But those armies have to eat, so each parcel that provides an army will have to be balanced by a province that produces food. Parcels that are worked by priests and bishops offer production bonuses to other nearby parcels. Parcels worked by burghers become towns and produce gold that can be used to hire mercenaries and other specialists. The parcels are grouped into regions with control of each region determined by ownership of a special estate parcel. These estate parcels are the ones you need to grab in order to gain land.   You can pause the game to review the situation, but you can't issue any orders while the game is paused. Though things get complicated from time to time, you'll rarely feel as if the game is more than you can handle. In fact, you may even start lamenting the lack of any time scaling controls for the periods where not much is going on. In fact, there's not even any sort of clock apparent anywhere in the game. Even if the developers aren't willing to offer a standard where one minute of game time equals a month or a year in the game, they should at least offer some sort of seasonal effects to the map to mark the passage of time.   As a king you're supposed to be able to rely on your knights to lead your forces on the battlefield. And while you honestly can rely on them to obtain plenty of minor victories, there are some significant shortcomings with the tactical AI that will require you to jump in if you want to win decisively or quickly. The AI takes far too long to commit to battle, even in situations where your forces outnumber the enemy by four to one. Knowing that my knights' forces are simply standing in ranks while their morale drops and fresh enemy forces are rushing to the battlefield is simply infuriating.   The one bright spot to this system is that you'll have a minute or two to jump in and take charge before your knights actually commit your forces to battle. A better system, though, would be to include a pop-up window announcing the battle and asking if you'd like to take command.    It becomes even more irritating because you can't place one of your vassals in a conquered territory if any enemy troops are present. You'll find that the AI relies on a trickle strategy to keep you from taking control of their lands. Beat the garrison at the estate and you'll be faced with a nearly endless series of battles against single companies fielded by the AI. When you eliminate an enemy knight, your opponent can start raising fresh troops again and send them right back to contest the estate. This makes the dalliance of your forces particularly aggravating.   When you take personal charge of a battle, you'll find that the fights almost always eventually degenerate into one big clump of men fighting with another big clump of men. Formations become hopelessly entangled the instant your forces are committed and, even if you do try some fancy maneuvering to get your troops into position, they attack the center of the enemy company, making flank attacks kind of pointless. I've been able to add a bit more sophistication by keeping some forces in reserve and moving them around the edges of the main fight but once you've issued an attack order, you might as well head back to the strategic view because there's not too much you can do beyond that point.    The 18 or so units that you can call on here are grouped into companies. So, instead of managing a motley collection of pikemen, cavalry and archers, you'll simply have three large companies of each unit type that are each treated as single units for the purposes of command. Formation and facing commands are relatively easy to execute as well, further lessening the burden. There are also siege engines to be managed here, but they have such a limited range that they can't take their place in the rear of your armies. Your own knights will run the siege weapons right up to the enemy walls.   The tutorial does a good job of explaining the mechanics of the interface but fails to provide any insight into key concepts of the game. Want to build siege engines? That's not explained at all. Want to actually capture enemy estates? You'll have to start browsing the manual. Hell, the tutorial never even bothers to explain how armies are created in the first place. You can find this info in the manual but what's the point of the tutorial, then?   Anyway, there are four campaigns here. One offers a single mission as you try to unify Ireland. From here you move on to increasingly difficult and complicated scenarios as the English, French and Germans. There's no real open-ended sandbox mode where you can try to conquer all of Europe; each of these missions is limited in terms of geographical scope and you'll rarely be facing more than a handful of enemies at a time. The diplomacy options here are well chosen but the game could do a better job of letting you know that you have proposals pending. I hate missing out on an alliance because I was too busy managing other aspects of my empire. Presumably, as a king, I'd be paying someone to tap me on the shoulder when a country I'm at war with is asking for peace.   The 15 one-off battles are a nice diversion, but they're far too short. If it takes you longer than five minutes to win any of them, you're taking far too long. The battlefields are relatively small, and the forces involved rarely equal the size of the largest armies from the campaign game. Though the basic gist of the battles comes through here, the forces involved and the geography don't always match the actual circumstances of the historical battle. Now I'm not asking for a separate Flemish foot unit here but I'd like to see a bit more adherence to the basics. The two forests flanking the armies at Agincourt, for instance, are pretty much non-existent, making the march through the marsh kind of pointless.     Once you're done with that, you can try the scenarios from each campaign in multiplayer. Though there's no real map editor, there is a castle editor that allows you to set the specific architecture of a given fortress. You're fairly limited in terms of piece selection here, opting basically for walls or towers or gates, but it's a nice addition that fans of the game will appreciate.   You can tell from the visuals that the game has a unique art style. The sort of story-book illustration meets boardgame meets traditional RTS actually works here. The art assets read very well individually, but there ought to be more variation among the various castle and unit types here. Why not have large armies kick up lots of dust, for instance? The clouds drifting across the land are a nice touch but, again, I'd love to see some sort of seasonal touches. Armies trampling fields to rubble as they march across the map let you see where the crossroads of war are. Battle animations are nice; I quite like the siege weapon loading animations.    This title's saving grace is its $20 asking price. Even so, there's no guarantee that the relatively simple mechanics won't start to wear on you. They sure did on me. Without offering a little more depth to either the tactical or strategic aspects of the game, we're left with two experiences that are integrated well enough but leave us wanting more.For $20, Lords of the Realm 3 offers a nice diversion and a pleasant change of pace from more top-heavy RTS games, but you'll soon be missing the sophistication found in games like Medieval Total War, which is also $20 now.", "date": "Mar 30, 2004"}
