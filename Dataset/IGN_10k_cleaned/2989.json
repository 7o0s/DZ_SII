SNK 2: EO for GameCube. The title comes to the console as a port of a port of a port of a port of a port, or something like that -- all based on a classic 2D brawler originally premiered in the arcades. As such, the game is definitely on the dated side from a technical standpoint, but the selection of characters and the fighting mechanics still hold true. The problem, quite a big one, is that the game, requiring precise manipulation on a digital front, just doesn't flourish with Nintendo's GCN controller.  The Facts  Traditional 2D fighter A wide selection of 44 different Capcom and SNK fighters to choose from Six different play styles / grooves Classic fight stages with polygonal-ized backgrounds New GameCube specific control scheme Requires nine memory blocks to save Two-player simultaneous play No progressive scan or DPLII support   Gameplay Capcom's Street Fighter franchise has starred in the arcades for so many years that it's hard to keep track, with something approaching a billion different half-updates and alterations to the same formula. GameCube's Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO is the latest. It combines classic Capcom and SNK characters, different grooves and game styles, hordes of fighters on each side, and then douses everything with an endless supply of brawler moves and combos. For traditionalists, it's one of the most complete fighting packages around.  The play mechanics are ripped right out of the old school book of fighters: lots of high-flying punch and kick combinations, more over-the-top special moves, and a wide wealth of projectile opportunities in between. Counters? Nah. This isn't Tekken. Gamers who played through Street Fighter II will be happy to know that Ryu and Ken are back (along with 42 other fighters), virtually unchanged, and still charged with powerful uppercuts, gravity-defying roundhouses, and more. With its no-holds-barred, arcade play style, one that's much more easily learned than some of the other fighters on the market, there's still quite a lot of satisfaction to be had from EO regardless of whether or not any of it's new or refreshing, which it most certainly is not.    Some partnerships are meant to be and others have to work at it. Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO and the GameCube controller fall into the latter half, and this is quite honestly our biggest gripe with the fighting experience. It's not a flaw or oversight that can be blamed on Capcom, but rather Nintendo's inability to provide a workable D-Pad solution on its controller. The truth is that this is the type of fighter that requires digital precision -- the analog stick simply doesn't get the job done, and Nintendo's D-Pad is both small and placed uncomfortably, which makes the process frustrating. Even after gamers come to grips with it (pun), though, there are other hurdles, specifically that the L and R buttons are also both being utilized as digital solutions, and they do so clumsily. We won't go so far as to suggest the relationship ruins the game -- that's an exaggeration that's simply not true. We've been able to deal with and, after some practice, master the setup, despite its drawbacks, and the end experience is still a fun one. But is the GameCube controller the worst possible one on the market for this game? Yes. Unfortunately, it's not a problem corrected with a Capcom-created alternate control scheme (GC style) that uses both analog sticks for all moves. The variation makes the fights too easy and somewhat pointless.   Capcom Vs. SNK 2: EO on GCN Graphics Beautiful. For the early 90s. By today's standards, though, Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO is anciently out of date from a technical standpoint. The title's 2D art style is one thing -- the characters are as inspired and well designed as ever and there's so much variation its commendable. From classic Ryu to Amazonian Blanka, a colorful beast that can encapsulate himself in electricity, the fighters have immeasurable amounts of character and they're almost all as likable as ever. But one would think that if Capcom is going to continue with the 2D art approach, it might at least add some frames of animation to the characters' movements. It hasn't, and so the brawlers severely lack smooth motions, especially when compared to the fluid scrolling polygonal background locales, of which there is also a superb selection. It's not a pretty mixture.  Sound The audio portion of the game is perhaps best summed up in one word: arcade. Everything is exaggerated -- an assault on the ears, full of high-pitched shouts, punches, kicks, and general thump noises. It works. When a character connects, players will feel it and that's due in large to the sound effects. On the other hand, though, the music is overblown in a bad way, a mix of 80s throw-aways and noisy guitar riffs. There are bound to be gamers who won't mind this, the same types who have gigantic posters of half naked anime characters on the bedroom walls, but not us.Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO is a solid 2D fighter on GameCube. It's the type of game that won't win any benchmarks in any single department, but its presence fills a gap -- one that would have been felt for sure without it. The game itself is outdated; a rehash of Capcom's Street Fighter II with truckloads of options and dusty 2D graphics, but it's nonetheless still fun and addictive.I think gamers who have in the past liked Capcom's fighters will find this GameCube update a fine one. There is the issue of the controller to contend with. It's possibly the worst pad for this type of game, that's undeniable, and it's bound to turn some players away in a hurry. But it's a hurdle that can be overcome -- really. After some practice I could pull off all of the moves I used to be able to do in the old games and it feels second nature to me now.Recommended for hardcore fighting fans. Others may want to go with the version on PS2's console -- the controller is definitely better.", "date": "Sep 27, 2002"}
