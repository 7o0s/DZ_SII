Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride is THQ and developer Graphic State's attempt to reproduce the exact gameplay of the Dreamcast (and PS2 and GameCube). And while the team certainly captured the essence of the original design with its wild and fast driving gameplay, it's the GBA hardware itself that keeps this arcade conversion from reaching its potential. Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride is definitely a fun GBA game, but you have to work through the game's blocky graphics and very inconsistent, chuggy framerate. Features Two cities (one unlockable) Four playable characters Nine Crazy Box challenges Cartridge save (two slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  For those who've never hit the streets in the original Crazy Taxi: the game design is a wild trip where players head off into a huge city picking up fares and delivering them to their location within a certain time. Accomplish this task and you'll be rewarded by not only the cost of the fare, but how much you made the trip ~fun~ for your passenger; hitting jumps, driving close to traffic, and drifting around the turns are definitely the keys to earning tips during your trek to your passenger's destination, and the more wild the ride, the more cash you'll earn. The game ends when the game clock hits zero, but picking up new passengers will add seconds to the timer...idly driving around without a fare is no way to play this game. There's not a whole lot of depth in the Crazy Taxi design, but it's definitely one of those games where you keep playing just to best your last top score.  The game design was originally made on Dreamcast hardware for the arcade and the console port; the Dreamcast was a powerful 3D system at the time (and still is to this day, believe it or not), and one of the charms of the game design was just how fast and furious the game was portrayed. The 3D hardware could handle not only the adrenaline-inducing wreckless speed, but also convey that speed in the television's maximum 60 frames per second rate. And while the GBA game developers managed to convert the gameplay over to the handheld hardware, the game just can't compare to the original because of the extremely choppy 3D engine used for the portable version.  See, the Game Boy Advance was never designed for 3D. Ever. Ambitious game developers have always pushed the GBA in directions it was never meant to go, and as we get into the system's third year of life many programmers are starting to milk true 3D engines out of the hardware. In Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride, Graphic State managed to create a full 3D representation of both of the cities used in the Dreamcast game, complete with texture-mapped buildings and, occasionally, street surfaces as well. The roads are peppered with sprite traffic -- about a dozen different vehicles drawn in several camera positions -- as well as sprite pedestrians and obstacles. The taxis players drive around the streets are also 2D representations, redrawn at several angles to give off the illusion of a 3D object. The game even tilts the sprite as it goes up or downhill, or banks around a curve, showing off how well the engine handles sprites in a physics model.     However, it's painfully obvious that the hardware just was never meant to push so much. The GBA can barely keep up with what the developers are throwing at the hardware, which is made clear by the chuggy framerate displayed on the GBA screen. In most cases it's acceptable and certainly playable, but when the player reaches a point where the taxi's bobbing wildly down a crowded part of town, with loads of pedestrians, vehicles, and textured surfaces, the animation can cut down to a range that has to be around five frames per second. It's when this happens that thoughts of wishing Crazy Taxi on the GBA was a 2D rendition can (and probably will) enter your mind.   But the framerate is quite possibly the only real bad mark against Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride. It's a huge problem for this type of game, sure, but it's clear that the developers of the GBA version were fans of the series and made sure they could make their game as close to the original as technically possible on the handheld. The GBA design features the same two cities, scaled down from the original Dreamcast game (and without the licensed locations like KFC, Levi's, and Tower Records), as well as the same four crazy taxi drivers each with their own vehicle. The music was always a staple of the Crazy Taxi brand, which utilized licensed music from The Offspring among others; while the same music doesn't make the cut here in the GBA version (licensing issues), the soundtrack is powerful and energetic in its own right, and fit the action pretty well.   The gameplay, while also scaled back to work on the GBA hardware, has been converted really well and is excellent fun when you learn how to Crazy Boost and Crazy Drift. Crazy Boost is simply a power boost to get the car moving from a stand-still (or raise the top speed a bit). Crazy Drifting allows players to powerslide into curves to save time or to increase the amount of tip to the fare; the riders absolutely love the Crazy Drift, and will throw money left or right when players put it to use. The Crazy Drift is a lot easier to manipulate and capitalize on in the GBA version since players can simply keep the drift going almost as long as they can keep the car moving down the road. But since each passenger has its own personal time to get to their location, players can't just continue to Crazy Drift down a straightaway since the car doesn't move all that fast when a Crazy Drift is happening. Crazy Drift is also important to get your car facing in the direction of a sharp turn without losing forward momentum...and if done successfully, players can Crazy Boost out of a Crazy Drift and save all sorts of time.  To learn the Crazy Drift and Crazy Boost elements, the developers incorporated several of the same Crazy Box mini-game challenges from the Dreamcast game. Unfortunately, Crazy Bowling didn't make the cut. But these games don't exactly teach the players how to pull off these moves; the manual might show players how the Crazy Drift and Crazy Boost work, but it would have been nice had the developers incorporate a bit of how-to training into the ~hints~ mode of the Crazy Box challenges. And it's just a little disappointing to discover that nothing unlocks after completing all nine Crazy Box challenges.   As accurate as the Crazy Taxi gameplay appears to be on the handheld, there are some little wonky elements that happen during the main game. The collision detection between taxi and traffic is pretty accurate, but there are times where a near miss will register contact with the opposing vehicle...and other times you'll drive right through. Zooming closely past vehicles is usually a sure-fire way of scoring tips from your passenger, but there are definitely spots where these situations won't register with the passenger at all. But these problems are few and can be worked through, as long as you're still playing after sneering at the framerate.  Don't be turned off by the game's framerate. It is the game's stigma, and it's a huge one, but it's pretty much the game's only problem. Look past the choppiness and you'll notice how accurate the game plays to the arcade and Dreamcast versions. The developers managed to get a whole bunch into the GBA game, including the two large city maps, a generous amount of sound samples, all four taxi drivers, nine Crazy Box challenges, and cartridge save. It's also a lot of fun, but it definitely wants to make me go back and play the original game on the systems it was made for: hardware that can handle 3D a thousand times better than the GBA currently does.", "date": "Apr 8, 2003"}
