It's most recent push was sealing a deal to publish a few games on Verizon's Get-It-Now service. One of those games is Flicky, a cat-and-bird romp that enjoyed a pop back in the 80s.  But like most things from that decade, save for Duran Duran, Flicky has not aged well.  Features:  High score board  Flicky is a very simple little game -- you are a bluebird that must rescue its chicks from a mincing mouser named Meow. You must hop and glide to different platforms, rescuing your feathered friends with the cat in hot pursuit.  We've said here many times that simple usually works best for cellphone games, but somehow Flicky ended up making us as happy as a wet cat. Not only is the control pretty lousy, but the game itself looks like bad leftovers. You must run from left to right, pressing up to ~jump~ to the next platform. Jumping, though, is never precise and you often find yourself slamming into the platform or missing it altogether. Everything is so floaty, its hard to get a bead on the exact timing of jumps.  There are items stationed on the platforms, like flower pots, that can be budged off the edge on to the cats below. But, again, thanks to the off control, timing these drops just right seems to rarely work out.  Back to Flicky looking awful -- really, considering some of the things SEGA Mobile has pulled off, like their slick re-do of Fantasy Zone, this is embarrassing. The bright green background threatens to wash everything out. The cat and bird sprites are rudimentary at best. Homage to the era? Hardly. Flickylooks like it was programmed in the morning, approved at noon, and out the door by quitting time -- all in the same day.  And anybody who owns a cat or bird knows they can be noisy little beasts. Not so with these furry and feathery folk. The games is, dare we say it, quiet as the cat that swallowed the canary. Hmmm. SEGA Mobile does its rep no service by porting this baby over the Verizon, one of the nation's largest carriers. Why risk turning off such an expanded audience with this lame game? Bring over Fantasy Zone or Monkey Ball, and leave this turd -- er, bird in the past.", "date": "Mar 5, 2004"}
