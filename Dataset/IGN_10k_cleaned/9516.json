Those five words clear up years of speculation and misinformation. Unless you have an SLI setup with at least two 8800GTX video cards, do not expect Crysis to look like the oil paintings that EA has been passing off as in-game screenshots for the last 18 months. Well, to be totally truthful, the game can look this gorgeous on a single video card if you prefer your framerate to run at a pace that makes the Lambert Glacier look hasty.    During your first days with Crysis, you'll spend more time staring at the advanced graphics options menu and various tweak guides on the Net (which are going to see some amazing traffic spikes when Crysis hits shelves) than the lush jungles within the game. I know I did - every time I managed to get a playable frame rate, I'd dick around with the options to try and get more eye candy without sacrificing frame rate. Which never happened.   This poor performance is a massive slap to the face with a reality trout, and one that we should have known was coming given the game's poor performance in the beta and demo. Our test machine is by no means a slouch - with a Core 2 Duo processor overclocked to 3.3GHz, 2GB of DDRII-800 memory, a GeForce 8800GTX and 680i SLI motherboard, this ninja cuts through every other game like a ninjato through decomposing manatee flesh. Yet in Crysis, this machine is lucky to get 25 frames a second with all settings on medium, a resolution of 1680 x 1050 and no anti-aliasing (which, by the way, appears to be incompatible with the game's higher level shaders). A crafty motion blur effect goes some way to hide the sloth-like framerate, making turning seem much smoother than it is, but it won't fool anybody after a short while.    If you want to see how good this game can look on a PC that you can't afford, check out our Video Review.  If you've been putting up with Vista's quirks, annoying alerts and rubbish sound support in the hopes that Crysis will make all of this pain worthwhile, I've got even worse news for you. To get a decent framerate, I had to disable all DX10 effects and revert to DX9. And even then, I had to lower the shader level to medium to get a playable framerate - which disables most of the cool DX9 effects. The end result is a game that looks like a heavily revamped Far Cry engine, with a bit more detail and longer draw distances. That is to say it's impressive but it's nowhere near the massive leap ahead that Far Cry delivered when it was released. The engine also has some serious issues, with plenty of pop-up, stiff character animations and some of the most simplistic building designs we've seen since our recent holiday to the shanty towns of Sao Paulo.    However, if you've got SLI on your PC, thanks to the grant left to you by your oil magnate grandfather, you're in for a treat. According to those in the know, you'll be able to run everything on Very High settings, in DX10, at a high resolution - the result is a game that is better looking than anything you've seen before. The result is a totally different gaming experience than us lesser beings will see - you'll be so dazzled by the jaw-dropping vistas that you won't notice the game's problems.   This is what the game looks like... on your rich drug dealer's computer.  I'm sorry to begin a game review with such a rant about visuals, but Crysis is all about the graphics. Let's be honest now - who of you gave a crap about the game's storyline, character design or even the cool new nanosuit's super powers? Nope, all it took to get us PC gamers whipping out our wallets for a hardware upgrade was the promise of near-photorealistic visuals, delivered courtesy of dozens of jaw-dropping screenshots.    While I'm totally screwing with the usual order of reviews, I should probably mention the audio experience. There isn't one. Other than the cool, yet repetitive, voice calls of your enemies, the soundscape in Crysis is a totally forgettable affair. I vaguely remember some dinky tunes during the time I played the game, and the 3D positioning is solid, but that's about all there is to it.    So the graphics are disappointing unless your PC is powered by a North Korean nuclear reactor, and the sounds could have been produced on a Commodore 64. Why then would you consider shelling out the hundred Aussie bucks that Crysis costs? It's quite simple really - like Far Cry, Crysis offers an open-ended, multi-path approach that is still extremely rare in the genre.    Like the few other sandbox shooters around, you're plonked into a massive environment, and it's up to you as to how you'll achieve your objectives. Sadly, nine times out of ten the objective is to hack a computer, but thankfully you have dozens of ways of doing it. So while the actual objectives are extremely repetitive, the means of achieving them never are.    Do you choose to take the stealthy approach, utilising your nanosuit's cloaking ability to get close to enough to those nasty North Koreans that you can snatch the copy of Kim Jong II's autobiography out of their back pocket? Or do you enable the suit's armour power, allowing you to storm through the front gates, all guns blazing in a firestorm of technology-fuelled American patriotism? Perhaps you'd rather mimic the Hulk's super-bounce, activating power mode, enabling you to soar over minefields and barbed wire fences like an over-powered pogo stick?    Considering all the hoo hah about the frozen environments, they play quite a small part in the game.  Thanks to some solid enemy AI, you'll need to utilise a mixture of these approaches to make it through the game with a minimum of F5ing. Spot a bad guy on his own, and you'd better take him down swiftly and silently. Screw up and he'll yell for help, retreating to get aid from his commie comrades, and sometimes even shooting a flare gun to call for heavy backup in the form of jeeps, tanks and choppers. You'll learn to loathe those f$!cking choppers, as they have the annoying habit of being able to see through dense foliage, following you continually until you can find a rocket launcher to despatch them to a fiery death.    Other times you'll square off against roving patrols, who display adept team tactics in the form of flanking and covering fire. Then there are the aliens, who are tough sonuvabitches. They're especially adept at flanking manoeuvres when you're in their zero gravity environment, and their high velocity allow them to rush you to great effect.    Given the huge size of the environment, you really don't want to have to trek across the countryside, even when you've enabled the suit's high speed mode. This is where the game's vehicles prove most useful - you'll have access to jeeps, tanks and boats, each of which handles wonderfully, demonstrating the game's deep physics system. The most impressive physics relate to the game's extensive foliage though - you can cut down trees and shrubs with machine gun fire in ways that would give tree-huggers a nightmare. If only the game included a chain-gun, we'd all be living the Predator dream. The detailed physics also extend to explosions, with many of the game's buildings being destructible if served with enough hellfire. Strangely though, the destructibility is a bit of a mixed bag. You can raze a sandbag-stacked machinegun emplacement with a well aimed grenade, yet a thin metal fence can withstand a direct hit from a whopping tank shell. Weird.    Like Far Cry, the sandbox nature of Crysis is both its biggest strength and its biggest flaw. It allows the player to approach the relatively repetitive situations in a massive variety of ways, but at the same time makes it hard to include cinematic, scripted moments to flesh out a compelling storyline. It sounds very harsh, but compared to the likes of Call of Duty 4, HL2: Episode 2 and BioShock, Crysis feels a bit like a soulless tech demo. Don't get me wrong - it's a fun soulless tech demo, but at no time did it grab me by the balls in the same way the aforementioned titles did. There are a few key storytelling moments, but for the most part it's you on an island, following GPS points to the next enemy/alien base. Cue intense battle scene for ten minutes, followed by a trek to the next battle. The result was zero emotional attachment to my character, any of the friendly characters, and I gave even less of a shit about my foes. Still, the variety of ways that I could send them to their doom meant I surprisingly didn't get bored.    A cool feature is the ability to grab enemy soldiers by the throat. Personally, I never used it, preferring to shoot them from afar.  Unlike Far Cry, Crysis has a multiplayer mode that is, gasp, playable! The crazy lag and connectivity issues of Far Cry have been put to bed, and the immense scale and lush foliage of the jungle maps means it's a very different experience to most other shooters. In fact, the maps are a little too big for standard deathmatch and team deathmatch, but they're just right for the new Power Struggle mode. This is very reminiscent of Quake Wars: Enemy Territory, with each team having to capture multiple objectives, purchase weapons and making heavy use of vehicles. Like QW:ET, it's also very complicated, but a brilliant tutorial mode explains the intricacies of this mode. However, at the risk of sounding like a scratched record, due to the extreme system requirements of the game I can't see the servers being populated anywhere near as much as rivals such as COD4 and QW:ET. For the 0.2% of the PC market that has an SLI system, Crysis is the shiznit. For these lucky few, mind-blowing graphics elevate what would otherwise be just another solid shooter into the realm of must-have gaming. Sadly, for those of us without golden toothbrushes, private jets and PCs from the future, it remains just a solid shooter, that isnt in quite the same league as other recent triple A releases.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
