With support for up to 10 players and classic 2D maps and playability, the game was one of the most enjoyable on the platform and was arguably the best of the series (many will argue that Super Bomberman 2 on SNES gets the honor of being called the system's best).   The various Bomberman games that were released for the Nintendo 64 weren't necessarily horrible games, but they were a disgrace to what the series has stood for and the first PlayStation version, titled Bomberman World, stayed true to the style of the old-school Bomberman games, lost a lot of its appeal because it used a lame isometric viewpoint and didn't really have the balance of previous releases in the series. While it has taken way too long, the PlayStation has finally received a game that does the series some justice and stays true to its roots in the form of Vatical's Bomberman Party Edition.    Gameplay Bomberman Party Edition brings the series back to an old-school 2D playfield that takes away all of the control and viewpoint problems that seemed to interfere with the raw playability in the 3D and isometric versions of the series that were released previously. As far as play modes are concerned, Party Edition has basically everything that a fan of the series would be interested in. Even though the single player game has never been that adored, it's still here and has two different gameplay modes: Modern and Classic. Both modes are pretty much the same except that the Modern mode features more current graphics, while the Classic gives you very old-school 2D Bomberman graphics.   Whether you play with the new or old graphics, it doesn't really matter that much, though, as the game is really lacking as a single player game. Bomberman shouldn't really be played solitaire and most people will only play this game by themselves if that's the only option possible. The way that the game should be played is in Battle Mode, against CPU and/or human controlled opponents, with the latter being the best way to play.   In the Battle Mode, up to five human controlled players can compete with the use of a MultiTap and this is really where things get heated up. The game allows for complete customization in terms of what power-ups are used, the types of power-ups used and other features including having Hyper Bombers on or off and Super Bomber Cart on or off. The ability to fully customize the Battle Mode really makes it easy to make sure that the game is a bit more balanced and diverse.   With all of the different settings, Battle Modes, various monsters and playable characters, and the game's raw fun, Bomberman Party Edition stands as one of the best party games that you'll get on PlayStation. On the other hand, it doesn't quite match up with the series' two stars, Saturn Bomberman and Super Bomberman 2. For one, the limit of five players pales in comparison to the fun that can be had with six or more in Saturn Bomberman. While the screen was a bit small with 10 players, the two times that I was able to get 10-player Bomberman going on Saturn have been the best multiplayer experiences that I've ever engaged in. And in comparison to Super Bomberman 2 on SNES, Party Edition doesn't quite have the same level of balance in its non-customized levels and lacks the same amount of charm.   Graphics  One of the reasons that Party Edition is a bit less charming than its early predecessors is that its graphics are a bit cluttered and overly crowded. In an effort to beef things up too much, the developers have just added to much to what's seen on the screen and it basically gets in the way of what's most important -- the action of the game. What's more, the artistic style of the characters and backgrounds just don't seem to have the same visual flair that we saw in Saturn Bomberman, which was completely 2D and sprite based. The game's not that bad looking, it's just doesn't look good in a way that helps with the game's playability and just doesn't have that much in the way of visual appeal.   Sound  If you've played any of the other Bomberman games, you'll know what to expect with Bomberman Party Edition in terms of sound -- lots of cutesy speech, irritating music and an overly bright and cheerful style. The game's music or sound isn't bad, per se, but it doesn't really generate good feelings despite the fact that it's so chipper. Turn it down if you're playing by yourself and make sure you and your friends yell and scream a lot when playing multiplayer to ensure that the sound is drowned out when playing it in a party atmosphere.  The Bomberman series is the king of multiplayer party games and Bomberman Party Edition is the best of the series that has seen the light of day on PlayStation. While it's a great party game and fun will be had when playing it, there's just no denying the fact that it's just not quite as good as either Saturn Bomberman on Sega Saturn or Super Bomberman 2 on SNES. Given that just about nobody bought the Saturn and most people probably don't have their Super Nintendo's hooked up anymore, then this might be your only chance to get a classic Bomberman fix this side of your PC. If that's the case, then check out this title, as you won't be letdown by its brilliant multiplayer action. However, if you still have access to those other Bomberman games mentioned, then there's really no reason to check this one out.", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
