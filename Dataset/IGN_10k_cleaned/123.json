There's only so many Mountain Bike Adrenalines that one can take before it starts to take its toll. An unexpected upside, however, is that a game that by all rights should be crap can sometimes end up being a pleasant surprise.    El Tigre is saddled with the unholy trifecta of being a kids game positioned at a budget price and based on a cartoon license. The sheer number of games that sport one of those descriptors that end up being crap -- much less all three -- is pretty much the reason why I have a job here at IGN. There's a reason why licensed games are often met with woeful groans whenever they come in: they are almost universally horrible, paper-thin wastes of ones and zeroes burned onto a disc. El Tigre, on the other hand sticks firmly to basic platforming and comes out largely unscathed as a result.   Right from the start, the game manages to elevate itself above the usual licensed schlock by not only controlling every bit as smoothly and precisely as a 2D platformer should, but it actually looks impressive, too. Titular star Manny Rivera, along with freely-swappable friends Frieda and Black Cuervo, move with a silky, bouncy gait, and the whole game sports a look and feel that's remarkably close to the cartoon (a 10 minute episode of which is tossed onto the disc and available from the main menu before you even jump into the first level).     By eschewing all but the most streamlined approach to moving from left to right, the game manages to cull decades of classic game design into something that looks downright pretty at times. Sure, it's just a series of double-jumps off floating platforms and spring-loaded pads, but doing that while dodging flaming skulls or skeletal birds is where the challenge lies. In truth, the game is probably a little bit on the tough side for most younger gamers -- particularly the last stage and the excruciatingly difficult bonus stages -- but with unlimited lives and no penalty for dying, El Tigre is definitely more forgiving than the old 8-bit platformers that inspired it.    The game also manages to recycle a basic set of moves -- double-jumps, bouncing platforms, jumps from moving mine carts or floating platforms, and the odd bit of vertical climbing -- just enough to keep it all interesting until the end. Unfortunately, that end comes in just a few hours (we're talking count-'em-on-one-hand short), but while it lasts, the game manages to mix up the challenge. Levels alternate between constant pushes of progress to odd bits of carefully-timed jumps, to throw off what would otherwise be a straight dash from Point A to Point B.   There are sections of the game that actually force you to sprint as quickly as possible to a piata while a clock ticks down (picking up tacos for extra time), but save for the last few segments, they're not especially difficult and are really just there to mix up the speed at which you tear through the game's four main levels. With the exception of the imposed time limit, these sections stick firmly to the same mix of avoiding things like spinning blades and using well-timed double-jumps to snatch a precious few extra feet of air time to make it to the next platform.    Cute platforming. I know it sounds like I'm rattling off a list of platforming clichs and in all honesty, that's all El Tigre is; a pure hop-n-bop platformer that offers only the smallest bit of actual depth to the otherwise 2D paths (you can move a few steps into the foreground and background, but it's a largely pointless ~feature~). Like the old-school games that came before it, however, this platformer manages to work because it's simply a very well done take on making one leap after another. No, it doesn't do anything new, but when the old stuff works this well, it doesn't need to.    Another thing to note is that the music is fantastic stuff. It occupies a little more of the aural spectrum than an electric guitar, basic crunchy electronica loops and a wailing trumpet. The mlange swings from driving action bits to more melodic guitar solos and even a rockin' version of the Mexican Hat Dance, and every bit of it is great stuff. Given that it's the focus, it actually ends up lending more to the game's cartoony flavor.Developer Blue Tongue deserves some serious kudos for sticking to a basic concept and executing it perfectly. Yeah, it's really just jumping from one perch to the next while avoiding stuff -- all while collecting coins (sorry, sorry, ~Macho Points~) to unlock stuff like bonus levels and costumes -- but doing so is actually fun. And that's kind of the idea of videogames to begin with. It sounds like a no-brainer, but the piles of licensed shovelware prove that it's not as simple to duplicate as it sounds. Which is exactly why El Tigre is absolutely worth picking up.", "date": "Apr 2, 2008"}
