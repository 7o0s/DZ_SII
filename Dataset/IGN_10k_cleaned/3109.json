It doesn't have the high impact thrills of football, nor does it feature the competitive back-and-forth mechanics of basketball. It is a one-man show, a game defined by skill, strategy and patience, and as such it's also a sporting genre that has always made the transition to videogames very well. Over the years there have been countless golf titles -- some flawed, some good and some great, but few that could be called the true Madden of golf with any validity. Leave it to publisher Electronic Arts, though, to change that.  Enter Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003. The title, developed internally at EA, wraps real and fantasy courses and golfers, a wide selection of mini-games and challenges and  more, around what has to be one of the most solid 3D engines in a console golf game. The franchise still isn't quite perfect --there are a couple of omissions and oversights that we'd have preferred were addressed-- but it's easily and without doubt the best golf videogame experience in years, and one deserving to be thought of in the same light that Madden is to football.  The Facts  Completely 3D game engine offers up rolling courses and modeled-to-scale golfers True-to-life physics brings the thrill of golf into your living room Play 12 different courses, including real-life recreations and fantasy; adds up to a total of 216 different holes Tiger Challenge mode features varied single-player gameplay that lets you face off against 15 PGA Tour pros in addition to over a dozen fantasy golfers Pro golfers include Tiger Woods, Ty Tryon, Charles Howell III, Notah Begay III, Brad Faxon, Mark O'Meara for starters Create your own courses and players based on those available in the game Precision control over your golf club with the analog stick; slice or draw by how you retract the club My Tour mode lets you collect trophy balls, PGA tour trophies, scenario medals, and much more New SkillZone mode mini-game lets you earn money to improve your golfers skills Buy new equipment and wear with the cash you earn Play Now mode features over 50 pre-set scenarios Golf commentators David Fegerty and Bill Macatee talk to you, the player, about your game Online passcode system will allow gamers to participate in global tournaments and be placed in rankings Save your created golfer to a memory card and pit him against your friends for bragging rights Does not run in progressive scan or support DPLII  Gameplay With most games, whether they're sports or otherwise,  mixing strong sim and arcade elements is usually a recipe for disaster, but Tiger Woods 2003 manages to pull off this most difficult stunt with plenty of attention to detail.  The title mixes in particles of both and then solidifies the pieces into one big package that works very well for people who want one golf game that does it all. This double-catered appeal seems to stretch its fingers to nearly every facet of the game, from the selection of courses to the characters available, the play styles, and more. The result, a thoroughly balanced golf game, is also one that might have too many arcade elements for the aspiring student of the sport, and perhaps too many simulation elements for those who associate windmills and go-carts with competitive golf.    Tiger Woods comes complete with 12 different courses, including derivatives of Pebble Beach Golf Links, Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, The Royal Birkdale, Princeville, Torrey Pines, Poppy Hills, Spyglass Hill, and Tournament Players Club at Scottsdale. The selection, still impressive, lacks some of the other hallowed pro courses featured in hardcore sim golf titles, but EA has attempted to make up for this by including additional fantasy holes. These, of which there are three, range from The Predator, which is set to the backdrop of a South American jungle, to The Highlands, a tribute to Scotland complete with castle and clouds in the distance. With 18 holes each, gamers aren't likely to grow tired of the straight forward links play, and there are so many addictive challenges and mini-games in between that we'd need a digital scroll to list them. Fabulous work.  EA's latest update isn't the same old golf game. The title features a unique analog swing control scheme, one that is more intuitively designed and functional with the sport than any other. Gone are the meters of previous golf experiences. Gone are the taps of buttons timed to power swings. Instead, strokes are leveled exclusively by the analog stick, and with a sense of precision more polished than ever before. Players simply pull back (down on the analog stick) their golfer's club with the stick and then push forward (up) to swing; the more ~weight~ behind the stroke mixed with the timing of delivery determines the end power. The system makes the backswing of the stroke as important as the downswing since leaning the left analog stick slightly to the left or right during the analog swing motion will put fade and draw on the struck ball. This is the simulation side of Tiger Woods 2003 in all its glory and it's superbly implemented.  Of course, there are other control attributes that complete the configuration, all of them designed to offer gamers a deep, engaging experience without breaking from the recreation. On tee and approach shots, A button raises the camera to different views of the course, X switches stroke style (flop, full, punch, approach), Right and Left triggers cycle clubs, and B makes the camera trace where the ball might land when hit. Players will notice that there are no measurement grids when putting, few line of sights to holes -- no real cheats. Instead, gamers must observe; look at the environment around them, hit away from obtrusive objects, and knock balls in based, for the most part, on their own calculations. It's very simulation-like in that respect, and it works remarkably well. Also, there is a heightened sense of satisfaction gained having sunk a hole almost entirely on one's own. That's not to say that there are no hints -- the distance of each shot is still calculated by the CPU, and a marker still shows gamers the general area of where there ball may land when hit with the different clubs. But the information isn't overbearing. And that's refreshing.    The simple process of adding a power boost to swings is nicely executed. A small, circular meter on the lower screen measures power, and it starts to fill red as players quickly tap the white button while pulling back on a shot with the analog stick. This is one of the rare instances where we found the original fatty Xbox controller's white button more user friendly than the S controller.  The trick is to tap fast enough to reach full power before the character reaches the top of the backswing so that he can apply all the extra juice in his follow through. When you hit it right, this simple function can add massive yardage to drives and there is enough skill involved in the process that it feels right. We love it, but we realize that simulation junkies may not; the good news is that it can be turned off.    The most obvious arcade touch as far as the swing is concerned is the option to put spin on a struck ball while it's in mid-flight. Tapping the black button and leaning the analog stick will put spin on the ball in the desired direction --if only Vijay Singh had it like that. We have no qualms with the process -- it's intuitive and works very well but we just know that simulationists bent on a perfect re-creation of golf will  probably take issue with such an impossible manuever. EA has at least included the option to remove the function from play, but when that's done there is no replacement -- spins are just gone, a disappointment. The other sim-arcade clash relates to putting. At points, the holes themselves seem slightly magnetized; they very occasionally reach out and suck balls in when they have no business being sunk. At the very least, this is an arcade intrusion and at the very most it's a glitch. Either way, it's infrequent, but there will be points when players question just how forgiving the game is willing to be.  Despite our minor issues, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 still plays like a dream. Meanwhile, the modes are plentiful, varied, and the artificial intelligence a noteworthy foe. The AI matches in the game's main mode, Tiger Challenge, are riveting. We've gone through 18 holes neck-in-neck with our opponents, who are not dumbed down, but very skilled, and come away with shortened fingernails and an overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Each Tiger Match won grants gamers mega dollars to upgrade their character's statistics -- everything from power, accuracy and recovery to putting, approach, spin and, yes, even luck. Fully accomplishing one's character is no easy task, but it's an enjoyable one, and there is a clear indication of advancement in-play for these upgrades. More still, various new levels are unlocked having beat Tiger Mode matches, as are access to various gear, from clubs to gloves and more. It's an extremely complete undertaking in this regard.  Gamers can jump into Speed Golf to compete in head-to-head matches -- the first to reach the hole and sink their shot wins. There is what EA calls a Skill Zone, a series of fantasy levels filled with targets and surrounded by dangers, scenario matches and regular stroke play for up to four gamers. Each area seems a virtual rabbit hole, deep with individual offerings. Gamers can even create their own course, in a sense: 18 holes nabbed from all of the available parks in the title. However, the effort serves up no real course designer, which is an oversight we think, and likewise there is no character creator, a definite shortcoming considering that the feature rests snugly in most of EA's other sports entries.     Probably the biggest disappointment, though, is that there is no real official tour in PGA Tour, so to speak. Rather, there are a series of one-on-one matches and the ability to play against three other AI opponents. These are not bad -- but they aren't tours with dozens of player in the field of competition and the pressure that comes with making the cut. It's almost as bad as Madden 2003 shipping without the ability to play in the Super Bowl.  Graphics Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003 is the prettiest golf game on any home console to date. The presentation, from the animated menus with Tiger and other characters moving about in the background to the quick load times and transitions between interfaces, is exceptional. Meanwhile, EA has developed a super slick 3D engine that renders the courses in real-time. From a purely technical standpoint, the engine is miles ahead of those powering competing golf games. Not only are the environments, filled with geometry and subtle additions such as spectator crowds, seemingly larger, but they are drawn without a hitch as the framerate hardly ever stutters. There is also no pop-up.  The holes are varied with all sorts of different texture sets, creating a wide selection of colorful, unique locales to play in. The courses are large, stretching hundreds of yards into the distance. Cinematic camera fly-bys and angles shoot the action from dozens of different angles and zoom in on the characters themselves as they move through the courses. It looks absolutely fantastic. All of the models in the game are exquisitely detailed. It's amazing how lifelike Tiger Woods looks and animates. When the athlete sinks a hole in one, he jumps up in down with hands in the air -- silky smooth motion-capture -- and the celebration is doused by a series of camera sweeps and close-ups. Original animation sets are used for each other character, too, right down to the way they swing their club. EA has even utilized a complex facial animation system so that Tiger and other golfers blink, look around and show various emotions, from happiness to disappointment and anger. Power shots are complemented by a host of different cinematic presentations, from revolving cameras to blur filters and slow-motion enhancements. Again, it's all brilliantly applied.  Maps are well lit and overflowing with subtle effects, from the way trees in the background sway with the wind to how the sun reflects in the camera lens, or distorts the visibility in the immediate line of a player's sight. The golfers, meanwhile, cast real shadows, there is a wide selection of particle effects, reflective and transparent water, and more.   On the downside, some of the textures in the game fail to match the quality of the rest, there is the very occasional slow down (mostly limited to putting, strangely) and, sadly, there is no progressive scan support. These graphic shortcomings are very, very short indeed, however.  Sound What do you get when you mix a cast of colorful golf commentaries with professional quality sound effects and hip, youthful music? Why, the audio portion of Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003, of course. EA, as always, has done a fairly solid job with the aural experience in its game. The title puts EA Sports Trax music to good use so that such bands as Saliva, Boy Sets Fire, 12 Stones, Paul Oakenfold, Ash and Silverchair provide contributions. The tracks, as it were, are for the most part very good -- a little light rocky, but as catchy and appropriate as any of the other EA Sports Trax in other EA Sports games. Rock music glued to golf is initially unsettling, but after that's hurdled it works quite well. Then there are the sound effects, which are rich and deep, from the thick whooping of the golf swing to the bang of smacking a ball into a metal post in one of the fantasy locales, it's all well done. This is all topped off by color commentary, a selection of humorous fellows who provide very little in the way of analysis other than to announce that the player has really smacked it good this time, or that they think the ball's going in for sure.  Like the real life superstar, this Tiger Woods really doesn't have much worthwhile competition either. But Electronic Arts has nonetheless put together a very satisfying golf game to go with what has to be one of the most precious licenses around.  EA has just about perfected the practice of blending simulation and arcade elements into one satisfying sports game and golf is no exception. I love the simple fact that you have to learn serious ball-striking skills to be successful in Tiger Woods 2003 but that you'll get plenty of wacky eye candy and payoff whether you're successful or not. Authentic sports mechanics in a fun and exciting environment is formula that so many other companies ruin. Either that or they don't even attempt to serve two masters so you end up with over-the-top games like Outlaw Golf. That Simon and Schuster title is a decent game, but unless you have an affinity for seeing strippers in golf videogame, you're better served picking up TW03 because it will solve pretty much all of your golfing needs.", "date": "Oct 25, 2002"}
