{"name": "Urban Chaos", "name_review": "Urban Chaos: Riot Response", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/13/urban-chaos-riot-response", "text": "The clamor of over violence in videogames spiked back in January 2006 when Eidos' 25 To Life was protested by police groups angry that gamers could, without consequence, shoot police in the game. The general media, as usual, saw an emotionally charged topic and reacted with typical aggression by feeding on the general public's overreactions. But few journalists followed that story beyond the normal trappings, and if they did, they would be honing in on Urban Chaos: Riot Response, the new PS2 and Xbox first-person shooter from the relatively new development team, Rocksteady Games.   Urban Chaos: Riot Response is an interesting and worthwhile effort -- and, like Rogue Trooper, it's a better game than it might initially seem. While graphically it won't wow you, partially because next-gen games are here and we're already used to their high resolution look, the fundamental game is solid and likeable, and the extras, especially the game's localized New York vibe, give it a feel-good tone and a unique spin on the heavily overcrowded FPS genre (at least on Xbox).     Not to knock in 25 To Life, but Urban Chaos is its antithesis. While there is violence and some seriously foul language used, you work hand-in-hand with multiple governmental departments to bring down widespread gangs trying to take over New York. You'll work with Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), firemen, and the police to solve physical puzzles, save civilians from death, and arrest gang leaders to interrogate later on. Rocksteady's game provides a palpable sense of local community and teamwork as you pursue the malevolent city gangs and bring back a sense of morality and civility to the city. There is no doubt the game, in a very real sense, is a subtle ode to the September 11 plane crashes, but it's handled with a sense of flair, color and personality that's unusual in videogames, and in a way, it's very moving. I mean, why aren't there more games like this? And why isn't the mainstream press covering games like this? If Eidos was being the bad boy with 25 To Life, which it was, isn't it fair and, dare I say, ~balanced~ to give Urban Chaos a fair shake?    Stepping off the soapbox a tier or two, Rocksteady's game puts players in charge of T-Zero, a local government special task force specially trained in fighting terrorist forces. As Nick Mason, the muscle behind the squad, you single-handedly enter into tough situations, dish out a goody bag of face-blasting, and take in the ringleaders one by one. You'll find the game sports an unusual selection of perfectly mood-fitting rock songs, the lead theme being especially apt, which are oddly countered by a blaring, over-the-top announcer who figuratively smashes you in the face with rewards. ~YOU WON THE RIOT GRENADES!~ -- blast the menu screens. We know. We know. On the other hand, many of the non-player characters are kind of colorful. One warehouse owner, who you save, actually says, ~Hey, I guess my tax dollars were worth it after all. Thanks.~    Aside from the cockamamie announcer, Urban Chaos follows a basic formula: enter level, blast stuff, complete level, and earn rewards. Only there are lots of little things that separate this from the standard no-name action-shooter riffraff that, unfortunately, Eidos has become well known for. Rocksteady has built into the formula several unusual elements. First, the game mixes well done FMV newscasts with in-game footage, going for a touch of the RoboCop/Paul Verhoeven feel. Second, in the 11 normal and seven bonus missions, the missions are structured to unlock all sorts of items, extra missions, upgrades, you name it. It's not unusual to unlock stuff in games. But Urban Chaos specializes in it. By setting up an easy-to-get-to laundry list of objectives to complete a level, as well as special objectives, players find themselves digging deeper into each level knowing that simply finishing it isn't always enough. Regularly occurring objectives include headshots, arrests, detective goals, and survivor goals. By progressing through the title, the number of headshots required to earn upgrades increases, from say five or 10 early in the game to 25 or 30 later in the game. Arrests require players to shock and detain, not kill, an enemy, using a taser device. Detective goals require searching and collecting, meaning you'll have to scour the game to collect masks. And Survivor goals are met by playing through a level without having to use the check points.     None of these goals need to be met to beat a mission, mind you, but, by achieving them, players unlock oodles of stuff. Players also earn rewards for capturing bosses alive instead of killing them. From unlocking additional weapons such as smoke and riot grenades, to sniper rifles and enhancements for them, to upgraded riot shields, players are consistently rewarded and encouraged by going the extra mile. Likewise, there are seven unlockable bonus missions that, when beat, increase your weapon arsenal. The game gradually scales up in difficulty smartly so that the balance between upgraded weapons and increased enemy AI toughness is met. Players also can pick up enemy weapons, such as butcher knives, Molotov Cocktails, nailguns, and smartly, a big fat chainsaw. Nothing quite like a chainsaw.   Urban Chaos does something else well. It gives players a riot shield, which is the main mechanic in the game. It's a nearly indestructible shield that prevents players from being harmed, be it by rifle shots, Molotov Cocktails or shotgun blasts. From a visual perspective, the shield is great. It registers bullets with cracks and dents, and later on in the game when enemies volley off dozens of machine gun blasts your way, it transforms from a perfect windshield into a severely riddled Jackson Pollack art piece in various shades of white. The mechanic also works smartly. It's quick and easy to use, and instead of being a detriment, gamers will regularly wield it. On either the PS2 or Xbox, the left shoulder button or left trigger quickly pulls it up or puts it down. Finally, the shield adds just enough differentiation in gameplay that, along with the many objectives and the co-op play with NPCs and hostage situations, it creates depth where there seemingly wasn't any. Rocksteady also works out a pretty nifty weapon selection mechanic, in which face buttons scroll through each weapon class, done while the shield is up or down. You can also reload while the shield is up.    Lastly, the non-player character levels are a little better than the normal sludge of its kind. You'll work with the police, firemen, EMTs even civilians to beat a level. The D-pad serves as a second set of commands to control these helpful civil servants. These characters can take cover, regroup, provide health, or break open doors or chop through debris. Firemen often warn players about back drafts, which can be seen by fumes drifting from underneath doors and fiery colors seeable in the cracks of the doors. Players even get a breather mask, useable in smoke-filled buildings.   Aside from the healthy, well thought out single-player missions, the multiplayer missions are all well and fine. You'll find a handful of objective based missions with up to eight players online, and they do a decent job of keeping this game alive well after the single-player missions are over.    The main problems found in Urban Chaos are that, aside from the likeable local NY tone of civil servants working together, it's not got a whole lot of style or individualistic feel. Eidos' FPS is likely to be easily overlooked because it's got no recognizable or standout main character, no real story that develops that character, and no real consistent art direction that gives Urban Chaos a visual distinction. Despite their occasional colorful personalities, all of the characters are totally forgettable. In other words, they're all distinctly bland looking, even generic. The object is to feel like you're relating to them, but no character development actually takes place, and since cops and firemen all essentially look alike, you don't relate to them on a visual basis either. Oh yeah, and the load times are exceptionally slow on Xbox.If you can get past the ordinary textures, bland character designs, and strange presentation of Urban Chaos: Riot Response, you'll find a technically capable game that offers a lovely little surfeit of gameplay touches that make it very worthwhile. While there is violence in this game -- headshots, blood, gore, and some conversations with the enemies that can get real nasty -- one theme stands out above the rest, and that's cooperation with civils servants for the better good of the community. Perhaps I'm reading too deeply into this game. But I don't think so. Aside from Urban Chaos being a workmanlike FPS packed with a great assortment of weapons and unlockables, and despite its rough art direction, the gameplay is solid, the mechanics are good, and the game is varied and fun.", "date": "Jun 13, 2006"}
