After playing One Must Fall: Battlegrounds, I'm not so sure it shouldn't stay there. I've often thought that an online fighting game would be a good idea and actually still do, but Battlegrounds misses in some key areas that make fighting games on the consoles so much fast paced fun. The balancing between competitors is decent, but it lacks the depth and style to sustain interest. That and it's boring. If I wasn't so busy cussing due to the lag and crappy animations, I might have fallen asleep.   One Must Fall 2097 was one of the last original fighting games for the PC that was worth remembering. It came out back in 1993. That's a long time for any platform to go without a worthy entry into the fighting genre. 2097 was a Street Fighter-like 2D fighter that pit different super fighting robots up against each other. One Must Fall: Battleground does the same thing, except this time, it does it in full 3D and does it online for up to 16 players. While I may not have ended up liking the game (at all, really), I have to give the developers props for even trying such a thing.   One Must Fall: Battlegrounds is a futuristic sport that pits giant robots against each other for the enjoyment of sporting fans around the globe. Players will have to pick both a pilot and a robot type before they can step into the ring and throw some punches. Pilots have different ratings for power, agility, toughness, and focus. These all affect different areas of combat just as you might imagine them to. They certainly make a difference once you're in the ring, but the bigger choice comes down to the type of robot. Each robot comes with different special moves and styles of play. I have to say though, I'm a bit confused as to why they set things up this way. In my estimation, the robots themselves should actually govern agility, speed, and power and the pilots should have governed the special moves. Maybe a combination of the pilot and the robot together could create the different fighting styles to create that much more depth and variety.     In any case, the character design for both the pilots and the robots isn't really enthralling. Pilots are cheesy, not only in their art style, but their seriously limited personalities and dialogue. Even in games like Dead or Alive 3 where the stories for each of the characters were bizarre and sometimes unintelligible, each of them had a certain presence that projected an undeniable sense of character into the experience. The robots and pilots in Battlegrounds are goofy, unimpressive, and in some cases, downright dull. The biggest disappointment probably comes from the lack of scale represented in the actual arenas. These are giant robots, but you never really realize this until you win a tournament and see a screen where tiny people are working on them. There should have been spectator stands, destructible objects, or... something to indicate size. Even the sounds for the fights are light and fluffy compared to the tonnage of metal that would have gone into these beasts. Thunderous footsteps, deep booming crashes, and satisfying explosions are all missing as well creating an overall effect that's much weaker than it should have been.   Of course, much of the dull and frustrating nature of these fighters is thanks to the sloppy animations for each of the robots, regardless of their design. Even walking and running looks silly. The worst part of this all is the fact that good animation is a key component in a successful fighting game. Being able to see moves happening from the beginning to the end in order to counter them, being able to see your own moves in a fluid way so that you know what's happening... well, it's important.    OMF:BG is a clunky fighter at best, thanks in part to what makes it so unique, the 3D environment. Getting used to the controls will be your first challenge if you're using a keyboard. Mouselook is not an option for those that might want to take advantage of it, so movement keys and attack keys will have to be configured to fit your fingers properly. Controls themselves are pretty easy. You'll have right and left punch, right and left kick, dodge, and jump. Each of them causes a different attack and can be combined for more attacks when used with movement keys as well. There are a variety of moves, but nothing near the epic proportions that you find in a Dead or Alive, Soul Calibur, or Virtua Fighter. Maybe it's rotten for me to be comparing them, but that's what I play all the time. Just the fact that these are giant robots seems to me that the array of special moves should be much greater than it is.    Once you've figured out the controls, you'll be able to pull off most moves without too much of a problem. Most of the finesse is in figuring out what kind of moves can be strung together for the most effective combos. There aren't really preset combos here like you would find in other fighting games, but if you time things right, you can deal a good amount of damage, especially if you can manage to hit your opponent up into the air and do a little juggling.    Actually getting your bearings and keeping track of the multiple fighters in the ring can be the hard part. First off, there's no lock on feature for targeting a particular opponent so it can be hard to aim at times for your bigger attacks, especially if you're using the keyboard. A lock on feature, something akin to Zelda's fighting style, would have been good. It's usually a cinch to lock and unlock from enemies in that kind of an arena and would have been appreciated here. If nothing else, a jump turn to get turned the right direction would have been good as you'll find yourself with your back turned to your opponent fairly frequently.   Navigating the arenas isn't very complicated at least. There are only a few of them that really use the 3D engine to create different playing levels, and even those are easy to find your way around. The actual design of these levels is pretty simple, although traps and triggered weapons will make things a bit more interesting. Still, as I mentioned before, it would have been cool to have some destructible objects in the arena, especially if they could have been used for weapons, a bit like War of the Monsters did for the PS2. There are some useable weapon objects found in arenas, but none of them are as interesting as clubbing your buddy with a chunk out of a building or some such thing. In its favor, the single player portion will throw some extra dangers into some of the levels that aren't usually there to mix with the dangers that are always there, which can be both interesting and annoying.     I'm guessing the relative lack of interactive features in the environments is partially to keep lag in Internet play down, which is one of Battlegrounds best features. It isn't often that you can sink into a 3D fight with 7 other robots and beat each other up. Internet play for a fighter is a great idea. Keeping the lag down in an arena that requires good reflexes, precise timing, and coordination is key. Unfortunately, in games over 6 players (the game supports up to 16) lag plays the spoiler. It's not fun seeing enemies disappear in front of you only to appear several feet away. It's also not fun to be hit and smacked around when no one is near (and I'm not talking about Chronos's warp ability or projectile attacks). However, you can certainly get the idea that online fighting games will eventually be something that we'll all enjoy once Internet speeds can match the experience.   Unfortunately for this feature, there are not a lot of people playing the game online. I saw 10 people at most split over two servers during my time playing the game. Considering Internet play was supposed to be one of the selling points of Battlegrounds, this doesn't bode well for its future.  It's really too bad that One Must Fall: Battlegrounds didn't turn out to be the PC's answer to the great console fighters of today. It obviously didn't have the budget that it should have as is evidenced by the less than glorious design elements and production values. I've never seen a fighter with such boring menu systems and loading screens.Basically, if you have a console, stick with it, you aren't going to find anything here of use. Go get Soul Calibur II, Dead or Alive 3, or Virtua Fighter 4. If you don't have a console and desperately want a fighting game, go out and buy a console and one of those games. If you don't have the money for that, then you can consider this an alternative, especially since it's really your only one on the PC.This is a disappointing fighter that lacks the personality, depth, and grace that console fighters bring in droves.", "date": "Jan 9, 2004"}
