But it doesn't need it. Everything you need to know is right there in the subtitle  this game's about a ninja master, and he's returning. He's back. To kick more evil ninja butt than ever before.   His name is Joe Musashi, and he's a modern day ninja who's trying to take down a villainous criminal organization known as Neo Zeed. He does so by using both standard and specialized ninja techniques, all somehow crammed into the functionality of three simple buttons.   The shuriken is your standard strike. As you side-scroll through Shinobi III's several stages, Joe can throw the flying knives one at a time, or in a barrage of several at once as he leaps through the air. And that  leaping  he can do with skill as well, as he's mastered the art of the double jump and wall-jump.     Joe can also jumpkick his foes, rebounding back off of their bodies a bit after making contact, and getting in close to enemies automatically triggers a contextual switch in the attack button that causes Joe to wield his sword, slicing bad guys and deflecting enemy fire.   It's worth it to go through such a listing of Joe's normal abilities to call attention to the great flow and control of Shinobi III. While taken alone, the fact that your hero can jump twice in the air or hurl ninja stars isn't too impressive. But when you're running across the screen, striking, leaping, spinning, killing and acting like a real flippin' killer ninja in one smooth, fluidic motion, you'll understand that the core of the Shinobi experience is all about the near perfection executed in the simple stuff.   And that the core of the experience doesn't have much chance to get stale on you, as the game additionally mixes up the standard action with some alternate playstyle sequences partway through the quest. There's a surfing level that plays like similar stages you might have previously seen in TMNT III: The Manhattan Project or Mega Man 5, and there's a level played on horseback that, impressively, features enemy characters who appear first in the background and then leap to confront you in the foreground head-on.   Rounding out Joe's fighting style is his handful of ninjutsu techniques  including major attacks that can do big damage all at once, like his summoning of several dragon-headed columns of flame, or his calling down of a bolt of lightning that electrifies his body. Most unique, though, has to be his self-sacrificing explosion move. It's a technique that actually causes Joe's body to explode. It does huge damage, but it makes you lose one of your lives in reserve every time you try it. That's pretty hardcore. That's what being a ninja is about.   But, luckily, if you're not all that hardcore yourself, you can still enjoy the Shinobi experience by taking advantage of the game's included difficulty selector. Putting it on Easy mode and giving yourself a larger stock of shuriken to begin with makes getting through to the end considerably less difficult, and it's far more forgiving than a game like Ninja Gaiden. Though it is a bit odd to start off the series on the VC with Shinobi III, it's probably better for gamers that this installment in SEGA's old-school ninja franchise came first. It's arguably the best in its series, after all, and the smooth feeling of its gameplay only came about as a result of improving upon the stiffer controls of its predecessors. There are now several different ninja action games to choose from in the Wii Shop, as Shinobi III takes its place alongside titles like Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Spirit  and, luckily, you can't really go wrong with any of them. It's 800 Wii Points for this one, and you know you want to see a ninja ride a horse and go surfing.", "date": "Oct 16, 2007"}
