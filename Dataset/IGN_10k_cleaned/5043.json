This is more difficult than it sounds. Often these attempts will excel at simulation, but will fall drastically short on gameplay. Or vice versa. This is especially true of sports games, where a high level of realism is tantamount to the sports fans' enjoyment. Formula 1 has succeeded at melding thorough realism and thrilling gameplay into one amazing package.  Although no strangers to fast paced racers, Formula 1 is Psygnosis' first attempt at a true driving game. All of their others (WipeOut, Destruction Derby) have put a twist on the genre, usually involving some kind of combat. This time, Psygnosis has chosen to focus its attention on the race itself, creating a racing experience that's almost as real as climbing behind the wheel of an actual Formula 1 car.  The sim aspects of Formula 1 are especially impressive. There are 18 actual tracks from around the world, and a variety of teams and drivers to choosefrom. Weather can be affected, as can the length of the race. Your car can also be modified according to how realistic you want to get. Steering and brake assist are also optional.  The cars handle much like a high-performance racing car should; extremely fast and extremely touchy. Each car handles differently; the Renault is easier to drive than the powerful Ferrari, although the Ferrari has its advantages in the straight-aways. Turning can also be something of a bitch. Because the turning radius on Formula 1's is so short, and all the power in the back, it's easy to spin out of control going around those high-speed turns. But mastering the control is ultimately very rewarding. Once you've tamed those exhaust-spewing beasts you'll be flying around the corners, no problem.  Formula 1's only fault lies in its graphics. While they're not awful by any stretch of the imagination, they don't stand up to Ridge Racer or even Andretti Racing. However, the graphics get the job done, and pop-up is kept to a minimum. These are minor quibbles though. Formula 1 is a solid, exciting racing sim that delivers in almost every category.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
