{"name": "Sudden Strike: Forever", "name_review": "Sudden Strike: Forever", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/30/sudden-strike-forever", "text": "The original Sudden Strike impressed me in two big ways -- it offered battles of a truly epic scale and it did so without cluttering up the process with base construction or resource harvesting. In Sudden Strike you were assigned a task force automatically. It was up to you to use them to get the job done. Well now developer FireFly and publisher CDV have decided to lengthen the war with a brand new add-on, Sudden Strike Forever.  The game adds four new campaigns -- one for the US in the forests of Western Europe, one for the German in the snowy fields of Russia and one for the Russians in Eastern Europe. There's also a new British campaign that simulates the battles of North Africa. Sadly, each ~campaign~ is composed of only three missions. While the missions of Sudden Strike are usually much larger than those of other games of its type, three missions per campaign seems pretty cheap. Rather than having four half-assed campaigns, I would much rather have seen a whole British campaign of twelve missions.  Seven new single scenarios are included that, to my thinking, could've easily been added to the campaigns themselves. Still it's nice to take more of a short-term focus from time to time (short-term in this case meaning a few hours). The new multiplayer maps are wonderful and come in a variety of locations and landscapes. What they don't come in is a variety of sizes. I would've loved to have seen some smaller maps for some more intimate battles.  You can, if you're willing, try to create these battles yourself using the map editor. It's not the friendliest thing I've ever used but it does have a tremendous range of options for you to tinker with. In fact, it's supposedly the very same tool used by the developers to sculpt the missions in the game. It runs in a Windows-like environment and offers you more than just the chance to create maps -- you can also set AI and effectiveness levels for the various units you place.  The new terrain sets for the desert are a trifle monotonous but still really impressive. I suppose there's only so much you can do with brown. But the awesome details and thoughtful level design more than make up for the monotony here. Building and terrain tiles are just as good as they were in the original game with an equally impressive set of visual damage states. There's nothing like seeing a whole town devastated by an armor battle.  The few gameplay changes that have been made are welcome. The task of mine-laying (and clearing) has been refined a bit. Repairing bridges is a lot less click-intensive than in used to be. Both activities used to require you to place the appropriate unit next to the area or mine-field before you gave them orders. Now you can just click on the spot you'd like to lay mines or the bridge you'd like to repair and the unit will move to the location and then carry out the order. Much nicer.  The dozens of new units are integrated pretty well into the balance and style of the previous group of units. While lots of new units have been added, the addition of officers and medics is probably most significant. Officers can now impart bonuses to nearby troops and medics can heal infantry. A new reverse option is available for vehicles that need to maintain a forward orientation to the enemy even when they're running the hell away from the fight. Sadly, the old problem of unit identification and selection rears its ugly head once again. It's really only possible to pick specific units out of a group at the very lowest resolution.  The straightforward interface has been preserved (as have the troop management frustrations). Thankfully there's now also three levels of difficulty in the game. The medium level of difficulty here is equivalent to the fixed difficulty level of the old game -- a level I like to call ~hard.~ Think of the new levels as hard, harder and ridiculous. The balancing and AI of the previous game seems to have been preserved here, meaning that you'll have to give each mission a couple of tries before you can really get going.  Ultimately a fan of the original game will take any opportunity to get their hands on even more Sudden Strike. But while there a few new things here, the developers didn't go nearly far enough towards either improving the original game model or adding a significantly sized new campaign. In the end it just feels like more of the same. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's also not enough to justify a significant investment of time. Sudden Strike Forever won't last nearly as long as it's name implies.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
