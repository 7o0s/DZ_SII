{"name": "Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol", "name_review": "Spec Ops", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/03/spec-ops", "text": "Ripcord's Spec Ops has always been the poor man's Rainbow Six, a less intelligent, plotless jungle romp with a squad of witless Joes on the readyline. Take 2's conversion of Spec Ops takes that a step further by officially putting a 'poor man' sticker price of ten bucks for this brand new game. Generally, bargain bin releases mean gamers are in for a rough time in a very bad part of town. However, Take 2's new approach is a little different -- Grudge Warriors wasn't exactly the worst thing I'd ever set my hands on, and both Martian Gothic and Darkstone are based on credited PC counterparts. The problem with the PlayStation Spec Ops isn't that Take 2 hacked the budget or developer Runecraft pinched too many pennies in the process. The problem with this Spec Ops is that it's Spec Ops.  Gameplay As a chosen profession, being a member of the US Special Operations Ranger Corps seems a foolhardy endeavor. You could get shot, a whole bunch of times, in places you wouldn't want to be shot. However, that kind of gig is perfect for a videogame, because getting whiffled with bullet holes doesn't hurt nearly so bad.  Or, at least, it didn't before Spec Ops. Unfortunately, the design behind this game (just like the exasperating PC version) is realism to a fault and then some. Every effort has been made to make sure that anything a player needs to do requires every effort on their part as well. For instance, though the game includes a GPS and Compass to guide rangers to their goals, enemies and obstacles rarely show up. Finding an enemy in the bush is pure luck, and they have just as much chance of spotting you as you have against them. Fair enough, that's sort of how it really is in the field (and skill and practice will help the coin find your side easier), but going out armed with only a 50/50 chance in any encounter means you'll lose half the battles. Multiply that exponentially against the thousands of Charlie's gunning for you in this game, and suddenly you'll find yourself wanting to call in air support and just carpet bomb the whole field. Screw the Ranger Creed, F' the hostages.  And that's just the problem with spotting them. Once a firefight begins, gurd' your loins because your in for some pain. Ducking and taking cover seems to be a logical first step to survival when you're being shot at, but not here. Stray fire will find you out with the quick-style. And if the bullets don't cut you down, the strewn grenades, mines, and booby traps surely will shred the rest of your meat.   If at least exacting justice after numerous deaths were worth the effort, I'd go at those bastards again. But the enemy AI is either notoriously cheap or oppositely brainless. When the AI is on, its too good. The enemies don't want to be shot. Makes sense, but I want to shoot them. Their ducking, hiding, and outmaneuvering would be brilliant in a less difficult game, but when you're dealing with highly inaccurate and unrealistic weapons (shot guns and machine guns often work just as nicely as rifles for sniping) and relentless crossfire, trying to find some guy's vitals through two layers of shrubbery at 300 paces on your knees while running-and-gunning isn't exactly fun. Then all of the sudden an enemy will pop up and sit there until you smoke him. You almost expect a sound effect to go with those moments -- ~Hey bro, you seem to be having a tough go of it, and I have to tell you, it's gonna' get worse. So you know what, you can just kill me if it'll make you feel better. Seriously, I'm just one guy, nobody in this army will miss me.~  The core of the gameplay is management of a two-man unit of rangers. Your buddy can take point or play tag-a-long in the rear, hold his ground or open up a can of whup-ass on anything that breathes. Switching between the two is a simple operation (and a brief load depending on how distant the two teammates are), and the design is fundamentally sound. The trouble is, of course, that the AI is funky in how it handles operations, meaning even on simple ~Hold your ground~ calls, you'll mostly have to do all of the work yourself.  Graphics On the PC, Spec Ops barely chugged along with a P3 and Voodoo seven-billion card phalanx pushing it along. On the PlayStation, you can chug all of that without bearing that high price tag. Framerates aren't at all problematic as one would expect from the PC edition, especially for a bargain title. The game runs smoothly, with a long draw distance for sniping fun. And with quality explosions, big fields, rolling hills, and smooth environments, the game's engine is light years ahead of Rebellion's sadsack Rainbow Six for the PlayStation.  It's still butt-ugly, of course. No matter how nicely the game runs or how much better it is than a bad Rainbow Six conversion, it's still unsightly. The textures are far beyond first-generation, with big objects like generators and cars recognizable only at a far, far distance, like a postage-stamp texture had been stretched and wrapped around a building. Interaction with the environment shows in chintzy effects and texture-swaps. And the background and playfield are drawn in a sort of wide-angle lens world where the horizon seems just as far away as your own two feet. The actual battleground is too sparse to substitute for a jungle, with pixel-thin sprite trees and a horrid lack of vegetation (save for, of course, the grass textures). This war just seems to take place in a big open nowhere.  Sound Low resolution audio always peeves me, and the audio workout in this game is grating. Even the opening FMV is crackly and sharp from mistreatment. Sound effects in the game are slighted by poor programming. Only when within a foot or two of a generator will you be able to hear it hum, and if you jiggle the controller enough standing right next to the machine, the sound will kick on and off from proximity detection failure. Call to the buddy to give a command of what to do, and you're treated to a terribly faux voice sample by some average schlub in a sound studio -- never hurried, with no command or fear, and never more than a few feet away.         Supposedly this version of Spec Ops had been lost in development hell almost since the PC game hit, floating around and begging for release for some time now, and just didn't have a place in the world with a potential publisher. That was, until Take 2 needed a few kamikazes for its budget game line-up. This is a well-intentioned game, but Spec Ops is an armless midget on a NBA basketball court with a bear trap on both legs.", "date": "Jun 3, 2000"}
