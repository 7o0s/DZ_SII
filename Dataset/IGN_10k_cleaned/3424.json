Though Daredevil hits theaters a week from this writing, game publisher Encore's getting a jump on things with a Game Boy Advance game that capitalizes on the rising popularity of the film. The design that the company produced (with the help of GBA developer Griptonite) is a little too bland and generic for a superhero with such unique qualities, and in certain places the game's just downright sloppy. Features 23 different levels Forty different extras to unlock Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Daredevil for the Game Boy Advance is your basic punch-kick-jump action platformer featuring Marvel's more unlikely superhero, a blind lawyer with enhanced abilities and senses. Though the game's marketed as a tie-in with the February 14th release of the Daredevil film, the GBA title is more based upon a less realistic, comic book design with bright and vibrant colors and the occasional ~Pow!~ and ~Bif!~ when knocking out opponents. Some levels cut across rooftops, others over vehicles in traffic; some go in buildings and underground. As players get through the different levels, they'll uncover the game's original plot through comic book-style cutscenes.  The challenge in this GBA rendition is to move Daredevil through the several enemy-infested levels using the hero's surprisingly limited fighting moves. This guy can only punch and kick enemies, as well as swipe his baton for a more powerful hit; but for a comic book hero he doesn't have a whole massive set of combos to pull off. Because of the limited attacks, the action gets a little redundant since you'll end up just punch-punch-punching your way through the different levels. Which wouldn't be so bad if the enemy collision detection wasn't so wonky in this game; some hits connect while others don't for no apparent reason. Sure, some enemies can block with a visual cue, but there are many areas where punches and kicks will just go unregistered.  While it definitely has potential if implemented well, the whole ~radar~ sense design idea doesn't seem to be well thought out in this game design...it's really just a gimmick to hide the extras and power-ups. As players move Daredevil through the levels, players are cued by little action lines spiraling out of the hero's head, which indicates that he's near an item (a health power-up or Daredevil icon) that can only be seen and grabbed by turning on the supersense. Lame. Although one boss battle is very clever in its use of Daredevil's supersense: players fight on top of a train that goes through the darkness of tunnels every so often, and players have the upper-hand since they can trigger Daredevil's radar to ~see~ the boss, who can't see you. Great idea, but it's not used nearly enough during the rest of the game.  Easily the most irritating aspect of Daredevil is its absolutely sloppy and chaotic boss battles. Fighting Elektra and Kirigi, for example, are two of the most annoying levels in the game because these characters have terrible patterns in their attack. They're nearly impossible to read since they jump around and nail Daredevil unfairly in their assaults. It's basically about getting lucky and finding that Achilles heel in the AI where players can just wail on the boss in that one area where he or she can't reach you. Bad, bad design.  The game features a whole lot of extras to unlock by defeating bosses or collecting the hidden DD icons, which does add to the replay value of Daredevil. It also adds to the amount of characters players have to jot down in the yucky password engine, since this password not only keeps track of the extras, it notes the level the player's currently in as well as the amount of lives he has in his queue. But the developers just didn't realize that some text characters look way too similar on the LCD screen, like 5 and S, or Y and V. So writing down the wrong password is stupidly easy to do.   Daredevil could have used a lot more flair in its design...as well as a lot more tweaking in the gameplay department. Graphically and sound-wise it's pretty decent, but the rest of the game design needs a whole lot of work. While it's not an overall terrible production, it's tough to turn a blind eye on all of the issues this game has.", "date": "Feb 7, 2003"}
