Spyro may look like a cute little thing, but this purple, four-footed, winged creature packs a mean punch.  The story in a nutshell  the dragons of the land have been turned into giant crystals by the evil Gnasty, 'cept for our little hero Spyro. By finding the lizards-gone-rock, you turn them back to normal and learn a little about your ~destiny.~ But I think I've said too much.  The whole game revolves around you (Spyro) traversing the land, collecting precious jewels and saving your buddy dragons. Since Spyro's a dragon, he can breath fire (naturally), glide (and in some special circumstances, fly), and headbutt enemies. Some levels can only be accessed after rescuing a given amount of dragons or a certain amount of gems  each level has a designated amount of both, so it's best to find everything before leaving a level. There's also a handful of bonus levels that test Spyro's dragon abilities  but you'll have to find them first.  Gems are hidden throughout the world, some are just thrown about and others are hidden in chests, rocks and such that need to be opened somehow. Use your abilities and get those stones! Amazing. I haven't had so much fun with a 3D platform on the PlayStation since Crash Bandicoot. I was a little weary, since the style is very cute and cuddly  but then again, I think the style actually enhances the game experience.The 3D engine is extremely solid and colorful  the animation is clean and smooth. The camera is the only real problem here, since it doesn't follow the character with tight precision; it tends to float around on a loose tether. I especially like the animation given to all the dragons when they're speaking to you. The realistic human movements give these beasts incredible personality.It isn't overly difficult, but there are a few points in the game where -- though it wasn't necessary to perform the task  I needed to ask for help. And that's not something that I do often. But it just shows how much I was encouraged to keep playing the game. I think that speaks well for Spyro the Dragon, don't you?A pleasant surprise was the bonus level where you have to fly Spyro through rings and arches, and light torches in a given time. This, too, wasn't an easy thing to do, but it was a blast to try to complete.I'm going to beat this game, even if it kills me. Two claws up. Way up.", "date": "Sep 10, 1998"}
