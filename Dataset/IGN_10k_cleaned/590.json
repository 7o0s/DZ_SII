Finally I use the tried and true method of solving this brain-twisting puzzle.  I crack it open with a screwdriver, put it back together, and Voila! I'm proved to be the genius I always knew I was.  If this was your experience with Rubik's cube then know that I feel your pain.  But now there is a brand new Rubik's cube game and although it's similar to the original, you get four new games that are even more fun than the frustrating colored cube.  The original cube is here just like you remembered -- in addition to its backward cousin the 2x2 Mini Cube and the super-evolved 5x5 Giant Cube.  The controls are set up so that you can move the cube around in all directions, of course, and manipulate its rings.  It even has a feature that allows you to color your virtual cube with the same pattern that your real (non-virtual) cube has and will show you how to solve it.  This requires a bit of digging through your closet to find the dust covered and rather beat up cube you once had so many hours of fun with, but it's worth the effort to solve it without the use of your father's tool box. It's in the box with the vintage checkerboard Vans and a 45 of ~Ebony and Ivory.~  In addition to the original multi-colored cube, Rubik's Games includes a number of never before seen puzzlers such as Zigthough.  This is a Tetris-style game where you guide a string of five colored blocks down an incline to get to the finish box at the bottom corner of the board.  The trick is to get at least three blocks of a color together. Once three blocks are touching, they disappear. The blocks come in a color order that you can cycle through so that the block color you want will be where you want it. In this way you break through the intervening blocks to reach your goal.  It takes a bit of practice to get the controls down but after that it's just a matter of quick thinking and fast hands.   Next you have Rubik's Playground.  This is a game where object is to get a given number of balls, which come in four varieties -- rubber, plastic, iron, and bomb -- into a exit hole.  This sounds easy but there are many obstacles that keep it from being so.  There are spikes that pop the rubber balls, magnets that grab the iron balls, and the bombs will blow up if they touch almost anything. To top it off, the courses get more difficult and varied as you go.  This game is more fun than a Saturady night fish fry, and it will keep you busy for hours.  It reminds me a lot of the old Mousetrap board game.  You set things in motion and then watch the physic's based madness unreel before your eyes.  Then there's Cover-Up, a game in which you unstack towers of, you guessed it, multi-colored tiles, so that they cover the entire board.  The catch is that you can only lay the tiles out in straight lines from the stacks.  Like all things in life, Cover-Up leaves the figuring out up to you. It takes some time to get the hang of this game but there are helpful features built in to the game that smooth the learning curve.      And lastly we have Paint War, a turn based strategy game where you are trying to paint half the 42 squares on the board or destroy all your opponents game pieces.  You each start out with six pieces that range in value from zero to five.  The higher value pieces can paint more spaces on the board but the smaller the pieces are stronger.  So that a piece with a strength of one can destroy any strength two (or higher) piece simply by moving onto the same square.  So the strength five piece is the most valuable, in that it can paint the most spaces, but the also the most vulnerable, because any piece under five can destroy it.  This is also an Internet compatible game so you can play a fellow Rubik's friend, or enemy.  All in all this game is a lot of clean, non-violent, weaponless, fun.  The graphics are sharp and colorful, the games are well designed and challenging, and, with five different games, there's a lot here to keep you busy.  If you like puzzle games then this should be your cup of tea ... or coffee, beer, well whatever your poison. Note to kids: don't drink poison.  -- Duncan Turner", "date": "Jan 4, 2000"}
