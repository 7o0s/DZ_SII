Capcom, through Activision's PR department, issued an industry-wide Devil May Cry 4 Restrictions document that basically prevents us from discussing certain key elements in the game until after the embargo lifts  or sometimes not at all. As such, we're going to spill our guts as much as we're allowed to, but our hands are still bound, so keep that in mind. Now back to the review.   A long time back now, when the PS2 was in its prime and Sony's successes and popularity were assured, Capcom released Devil May Cry  and it just about reset the action-platformer genre. The speed of the combat, the quality and fluidity of the animation and cutscenes and the excellent storyline with likeable rogue Dante in the lead set the first game in the series ahead of its imitators  of which there have been many subsequently, including God of War.   Skip ahead, and the series has had a couple of ups and downs, but largely the name still rings clearly and sweetly to fans and casual gamers alike. Devil May Cry 4 returns to those highs with an entry that gives long-time fans more of the same, while adding a few key elements and big twists to the otherwise formulaic DMC experience. The most obvious and influential change is the decision to relinquish control of Dante, instead replaced with a look alike called Nero. It's not a permanent swap-out, as you may have guessed, but you'll be spending plenty of time in Nero's boots  and that's no bad thing.     Nero, you see, is your younger and less street-wise anti-hero to Dante's seasoned and casual reappearance at the start of the game. His love interest, the sing-songy Kyrie, gets caught in the middle of a religious movement gone awry, and Dante is on the run for starting the whole debacle. Nero ends up pursuing Dante for a fair chunk of the game, while Kyrie is held captive and we, as players, slowly try to piece together the story (a continuation of Devil May Cry 2). For what it's worth, the PS3 version allows you to install a large portion of the game onto the hard drive, during which you'll be entertained with a decent looping recap of the story. Handy.   The next twenty or so chapters, each taking between 20 minutes and an hour to traverse, take you through mines, jungles, sprawling castles and mansions, city streets and somewhat irritatingly, back again. While the first half of the game keeps the pace balanced between exploration and platforming, there are already hints that there's going to be a fair amount of backtracking involved. You'll be tasked with trekking into, through and back out of all sorts of environments, usually with an alternate way out that still criss-crosses the same pathways and locations.   I can't believe it's not butter Dante!  Nero's combat moves are similar in nature to Dante's. You still wield a pistol (the Blue Rose) and a slick demon-ending blade (the Red Queen). The Red Queen is a gas-powered sword that responds to revving, like an engine. You can pump the L2 trigger to rev the blade up, and by striking and revving, you can execute more damage and with greater and greater speed.    The slower rate of the Blue Rose's fire takes a little time to adjust to, but it can be powered up gradually though using an experience system based around a new form of orb awarded at the end of each level. These experience orbs can be accumulated, spent, refunded and reassigned at your discretion, allowing you to pour your earned experience into as few powerful moves or as many generic ones as you prefer. While this new system feels more flexible and interesting than past iterations, the most interesting new inclusion is Nero's demonic arm, the Devil Bringer.    Assigned by default to the Circle button, the Devil Bringer is effectively a grapple button. With it, you can grab and throw enemies, grapple from special points, and it's the key to many significant moments in the game. It also makes DMC4 a much more aerial-oriented experience, with Nero able to leap into the air, pull an enemy over from the far side of the room and grapple with him in mid-air. This move also forms the foundation of a few puzzles in the game. Nero actually floats from point to point a little like Mario does in Super Mario Galaxy as a point of reference.    Actually, if you needed a good example of the cyclic nature of games development these days, take a long and discerning look at DMC4. It's actually possible to pick the other games in the market that clearly had a direct influence on the game design. Specifically, we're pointing the finger at The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess' puzzles and temple designs, Shadow of the Colossus' texture work and fantasy, and shockingly, the teacher has become the pupil it seems, as God of War II's scale and use of towering animated statues plays a significant part in the adventure.   That's not to say that Capcom hasn't stamped DMC4 with its own personality  which is has in spades  but there's an eerie feeling of familiarity about the whole experience. Where DMC4 does its best work is in the combat  feeling as solid and entertaining to execute as it ever has, and more so with the inclusion of the Devil Bringer arm and its grappling and throwing abilities.   All up, however, the experience draws much more heavily from the feel of the first game in the series, rather than 2 and 3, which were arguably lesser entries. You'll still be fighting hordes of Scarecrows, collecting red orbs to be exchanged for items that improve your health and special power bar, as well as refilling both gauges. Saving can be performed at any time, but you'll have to contend with replaying the whole stage from the start, since there's no mid-level respawn point if you quit.    The Frosts from early in the adventure. They're cold like your ex-girlfriend.  It's also bitterly hard on the default difficulty setting, which should come as no surprise to veterans of the series. Capcom just makes hard games. Suck it up. Stop complaining  there's an easy option that brings it back down to near-human levels of reaction time and skill. If anything, this is a game that's meant to be hard; you should learn to play with Nero's less button-mash-friendly combos and reduced speed. On the flipside, the game does favour breaking up each level into what is essentially one fighting arena after another; though there's a design quirk here at its heart. The game loses some of the hard-fought flow and pace, since you constantly have to break from the running and platforming mindset to tackle an unexpectedly difficult encounter.   Mostly, you'll have just enough health to get you through these kinds of instance-encounters, where the room will seal itself up. You'll survive  but you'll really need to take advantage of opportunities to stock up on items and tweak your assigned abilities and weapon functions. Otherwise, after accidentally falling over an edge and plummeting back to earth, you'll find yourself tackling a throng of Scarecrows, Angel Knights, Frosts, robotic sharks and other Hell Gate spawn on an empty tank. And that's not fun, since respawning enemies truly are the devil's spawn. We hate them. Hate, hate, hate them. Seriously, it's a good thing the combat's so delightfully delicate and near-perfect, because you'll be re-killing your way out of a lot of rooms you've already cleared.    The game's influences can be felt in level designs (Lost Forest? Straight from Zelda) and in some monster encounters.  Given that's it's pretty much common knowledge that Dante is eventually playable, we're going to spend the next portion of the review talking about why his segment actually ends up being more fun to play. It's the 'Solid Snake/Raiden' scenario all over again. On one hand, there's nothing wrong with using Nero  he's pretty agile, has some fantastic counter moves, aerial techniques and he even gets to flip Dante the bird in one of the most entertaining moments of the whole game. But for all the red and black leather, he's not Dante, and as soon as you do start playing as Dante, you'll feel the differences between the two characters immediately.    Dante is definitely faster on the trigger, thanks to his side-arms, Ebony and Ivory. But he's also more agile now, thanks to a new combat system that is exclusively his to utilise. The D-pad is now used to switch between four different combat styles  Trickster, Royal Guard, Gunslinger and Sword Master  each creating a variation on the complexity of the sword and gunplay, while also tweaking the purpose of the Circle button on the fly. For instance, in Sword Master mode, Dante uses Circle to fan his sword in front of him like a windmill, while in Royal Guard mode, he blocks front-on attacks.    Given that Devil May Cry has been one of Sony's key third-party franchises since the PS2, the fact that DMC4 is also being released on the Xbox 360 probably comes as a bit of a slap in the face. The reality is, however, that development costs on these two platforms are just too high to stay financially viable for most companies. Thankfully, the PS3 version is an outstanding looking piece of work. It's easily one of the most impressive games on the system from a visual standpoint  Capcom's trademark excellent character design tradition continues. Dante looks older and more unkempt  a little like Tom Cruise in Collateral. The faces are well animated and lip-synched in English, which goes a long way in counteracting the slightly stodgy translation.     Still, for all the gorgeous HDR lighting, impeccable textures and motion-captured animations, epic encounters, sweeping sunset vistas over the sea and so on, the shadows look almost second-rate. There's an unnerving level of flicker, edges are strangely jagged and don't smoothly transition into darkness, instead looking pixellated. It's a little distracting, given the rest of the game is lovely to behold. We're guessing it's the product of outdated techniques that were good enough a year ago, but a year is a long time in an industry like this.   The music still retains the same high-energy mix of electronica and hard metal, fusing to create a soundtrack that has as much attitude and bravado as the charismatic lead characters themselves. Like it or not, energetic electrometal keeps pace with the combat, and it makes the orchestral and choral interludes a little more poignant. The voice acting remains in the high-end of quality at all times; sure, the central enemy chews through his dialogue with about as much conviction as an television soap star, but Dante and Nero make the most of it, delivering some entertaining one-liners and keeping their characters memorable beyond almost all of the others in the game  arguably as it should be.   It's got its share of rough edges, but DMC4 is gorgous and fun.  Aside from the issues mentioned throughout the review, a few more also keep Devil May Cry on the frowny-face side of a nine. Though cinematic camera angles do wonders for effect and atmosphere, by reversing the camera's position on the other side of a doorway, transitions can be jarring. It means you'll be running in one direction for a while just for the camera to position itself on the opposite side and flip itself, so you end up running back into the room you came from. In a best-case scenario, it's irksome. In the worst-case, you'll get a room full of monsters to fight all over again. Manual camera control is also only used sporadically, and you'll be thankful for it when it's allowed. No first-person mode is a hassle too  particularly when judging jumps, which segues nicely into our next issue.   Jumping still remains a problem, as it has since the first game. Nero and Dante both have a tremendous vertical jump, but very little in the way of forward leap. The lack of arcing forward movement means that landing on a platform that is moving can be incredibly frustrating, and no amount of learning to compensate can make up for the unforgiving precision needed in certain areas (room of rotating blades, we're looking at you).   The Exceed System, the system behind revving Nero's sword, can be ignored almost completely. By the point where you take up control of Dante, it's almost an afterthought alone, since there are plenty of superior abilities at your disposal.   And that's it. Devil May Cry 4 is still excellent stuff  thoroughly entertaining, mostly well paced, despite the on-off-on battles. While there are definitely some issues to be worked through if there's a DMC5 on the cards (and come on, this probably isn't the end), the storytelling is worth the trip, the combat remains fun, and there are two major features that we can't even mention that also go a good way towards making you want to replay each level and try for the best letter ranking possible. Nero, Dante, swords, guns, jiggling breasts and a whole lot of fun in between; dig in.", "date": "Feb 1, 2008"}
