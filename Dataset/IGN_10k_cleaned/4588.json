Already considered by many to be the most receptive and open development group in existence, the Japanese historical simulation king routinely improves its sequels with unmatched focus and precision. In the last few years alone, players have consistently been treated to several advancements in their favorite company franchises, with games like Dynasty Tactics, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Dynasty Warriors accumulating nearly every requested addition. And with KOEI's list of SKUs increasing with every passing financial period, that trend doesn't appear to be disappearing.   Perhaps the best example of this is the company's latest attempt at progress, Crimson Sea 2. Originally conceived as an Xbox title (which admittedly received less than blockbuster sales numbers), this PlayStation 2-exclusive does almost everything that a follow-up should. Not only is it a bigger, prettier, faster, and more streamlined experience than it was before, it also fixes nearly all the problems associated with its predecessor. The end result is an action/adventure title of such surprising quality that we can't help but find ourselves incredibly addicted to its simplistic but enthralling hack and shoot philosophy.   Story  One of Crimson Sea 2's strongest aspects is the fact that it boasts one of the most intriguing and compelling storylines in the action genre. Though producer Kou Shibusawa had already established a plot-heavy tone in the first title, it never seemed to gel with the gameplay as effectively as it does this time. The frequent, sometimes awkward cut scene pauses that interrupted the flow of the action so blatantly in the Xbox original are now almost completely a thing of the past. And while there are still a couple of cinematic bits and pieces in the midst of heated battles, the sequel's story presentation lends itself more to that of a bookend approach rather than a tapestry.    For those looking for specifics, Crimson Sea 2 picks up two years after the events the original; with returning hero and Vipa super warrior Sho still struggling with his role as protector of the universe. Though he overcame the odds and put a stop to the menace that threatened humankind's existence several revolutions ago, he's still haunted by personal ghosts and unanswered questions about his powers. Unfortunately those emotions get an even stronger workout when an all-new threat invades the Theophilus Star System and drives humanity to the brink of extinction. Things look undeniably grim and it's only with the aid of his fellow IAG agents and a new playable character named Feanay that Sho is able to answer the call of battle a second time.   Now on the outside, Crimson Sea 2's premise may sound a little familiar to longtime fans of science fiction and fantasy-based videogames -- but that's where the similarities stop. Rather than go down a tested black and white path that most other installments typically do, Crimson Sea 2 not only explores its characters' several shades of gray, it also changes their motives, kills off main protagonists, and unveils an ample number of surprises. Sure it isn't Shakespeare, but for an action game set in the future, it's a damn fine fairy tale.    Gameplay  Where Crimson Sea 2 really excels, though, is with its vastly improved mechanics. As most returning players may remember, the original version on Xbox suffered from that classic Resident Evil-type 'slow turn' maneuver and a stiffly-controlled camera. The result was often disastrous in narrow passageways and when surrounded by enemies -- making it difficult to navigate speed or damage-related missions in a fast and efficient manner. Crimson Sea 2, on the other hand, throws all that out the window by giving its user an entirely smooth 3D control scheme and a free roaming camera controlled entirely by the right analog stick. And while there are still a number of perspective issues that can cost you hit points in cramped or hectic environments, the problem with seeing straight is nowhere near as bad as it was before. In fact, between the enhanced control response and better camera work, this new installment feels like an entirely different experience.   Of course, one of the key reasons for that difference is the fact that players can now take control of the female whip-ass artist Feanay in addition to that of Sho. Though Sho comes across as more of a powerhouse with a tendency to move rather slowly, Feanay offers an alternative approach that favors speed and tactics over brawn. And while it's true that both characters will play almost exactly the same at their base level, their powers and abilities are so strongly contrasted that it doesn't really feel that way.   Regardless of which characters players choose, though, it's the depth of their combat choices that really powers the action forward. When up close, users are given the ability to unleash their blade weapon for combination attacks, melee chains, or precursors to more intricate special maneuvers. At a distance, they can unleash four different types of artillery of varying power levels and absolutely decimate whatever gets in front of them. If players are particularly skilled they can use their power gauge at the bottom of the screen for a series of different special attacks and link-combos; with techniques like NeoPsionics (which are essentially magic spells), Overdrives (supercharged projectile strikes), Gravity Blades (powered-up melee attacks), and Time Extends (slows enemy movement for increased combat chains) to help them out. Best of all, all of these methods are easy to learn and fun to use -- turning even an average player into a bona fide commando in a matter of moments.    Another big addition to Crimson Sea 2 is the increased overall difficulty. Though the A.I. rarely strays from that of a typical mindless attack drone, there is a relentless wave upon wave of incredibly ruthless insectoid creatures constantly overwhelming your character. Players can typically find themselves face-to-face with as many as three to four hundred different monster targets at once, with certain areas of the stage even re-spawning new and different kinds of foes after you've met specific objectives. Adding even more challenge to the pot are the boss fights, which are both epic and enormous (the first honcho alone is more than three screens big with constant and multiple methods of aggression) and are some of the most entertaining we've experienced lately. Though we'd be remiss to say that we wish there were a greater selection of enemies and maybe four or five more boss battles to participate in.    Adding even more life to the experience is the ability to modify your character's combat skills. If, for example, the constant flow of monster teeth is too much for you in the beginning, you can always return to stages you've already played and collect experience items known as origins to upgrade. More intuitively put together than the advancement method from the first game (you no longer have to assemble various weapon part combinations for different effects), the promotion screen is as simple as assigning points to whatever weapon attribute you want to improve -- it's that easy. There is also a couple of special armor-related and reincarnation items too, and gamers can even earn general experience points towards the growth of their health meter. Depth is not an issue here.   Unfortunately there are still a couple of additional issues that keep Crimson Sea 2 from reaching the upper echelon of PlayStation 2 action titles. Granted, the inclusion of three different kinds of multiplayer modes and triple the amount of missions found in the original was a nice touch, but their focus is all too similar. For the most part, your solitary goal is to find and fetch whatever event item you need or to protect some half-witted NPC from danger in a stretched-out escort quest. And as fun as the combat engine and constant flow of enemies may be for Dynasty Warriors junkies, by the time players reach the 50th and 60th missions, things will definitely be rather repetitive. The lack of environmental interactivity was a bit of a bummer too (you can break occasional walls and crates, but that's about it) and the puzzle elements are so basic they make the first Resident Evil look like a Rubik's Cube.    Graphics  KOEI has done an amazing job with the Crimson Sea 2 engine and has actually pulled off the seemingly unheard of task of making the PlayStation 2 version look better than the Xbox original. While not as high-res as the Microsoft installment before it, the PS2 edition of Sho and friends offers a much larger variety of textures with more vibrant colors and effects. Character models in particular look incredibly good and easily eclipse KOEI's other action-oriented franchises like Dynasty Warriors and Mystic Heroes in terms of intricacy and animation. Best of all, the framerate is top notch with very few instances of slowdown that aren't intentional (re: Time Extends).   Artistically the game is just a strong with obvious influences from Square Enix character designers Tetsuya Nomura (The Bouncer) and Tatsu Tsukamoto (Final Fantasy X-2). In fact, Crimson Sea 2 looks very much like a mid-level Square Enix project in several ways -- as not only are the CG cut scenes exceedingly well put together and stages carefully detailed, but the futuristic setting also exudes a distinct level of personality through its selection of lighting, shadow, and background objects. The only real detriment is the occasional camera issue mentioned earlier in the gameplay section. That's not a bad visual resume in the least.   Sound  Sometimes we wonder if the Crimson Sea series was originally meant to be a collection of RPGs, as not only is the story consistently interesting with plenty of character development but the soundtracks are always epic and magnificently scored. Mixing classical-style orchestrated pieces with jumping space junkie techno, it definitely has a fitting personality with several handfuls of memorable tracks. Composer Yoshihiro Ike (Blood: The Last Vampire) should definitely get his props for this one and we can only hope to see an official album release in retail outlets rather soon.    Vocally, Crimson Sea 2's actors aren't quite as powerful but they definitely get the job done. At the very least it's better than the first game's which had several lines of unintentionally funny dialogue and delivery. There seems to be a lot more speech this time around as well, with dubbed reactions to every CG movie in the game. Like the enemies and mission variety, however, the sound effects could have used a lot more variety. But at least they've been recorded in Dolby Pro Logic II (5.1 for cut scnenes) and that's always worth mentioning.Though Crimson Sea 2 is aimed primarily at fans of titles like Dynasty Warriors, Shinobi, and the like, the game is so easy to get into and so deep with its gameplay conventions that we can definitely see this one appealing to just about anyone who gives it the chance. Sure it can get a little repetitive and yes its mission structure may be a bit on the bland side, but does that keep it from being an overly enjoyable experience? Definitely not! In fact, Crimson Sea 2 is one of the most enjoyable games we've played in 2004 so far and that's no exaggeration.But with more than 60 different missions to choose from, two diverse and very playable characters, three kinds of multiplayer modes, a deep and compelling storyline, and the entire cinematic library from the original game to catch new players up to speed, why wouldn't it be? We're already trying to imagine what one more shot at a sequel could actually bring us; as a couple of tweaks to the camera system, a larger and more diverse enemy list, a possible online mode, and some improvements to the mission design could truly catapult this series into AAA status (because as fun as it is, it isn't quite there yet).Unfortunately we don't expect public awareness for Crimson Sea 2 to be very high -- as KOEI's vault of action games outside of Dynasty Warriors is traditionally rather secluded; giving us the impression that the chances of it reaching the level of success it deserves are rather slim. But for those of you lucky enough to give it a shot, we're confident that you'll find it just as endearing as we did. Flawed but fun, Crimson Sea 2 may be mindless but at least it has a soul.", "date": "Mar 26, 2004"}
