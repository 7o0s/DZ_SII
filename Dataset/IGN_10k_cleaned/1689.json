Broke it right in half.  There is so much that I absolutely love about Kengo, the heir in spirit to their Bushido Blade swordsmanship simulators, that it hurts me terribly to have to knock it the way I'm about to.  But there is also so much about this game that is just badly broken - each intensely cool element of its setting and presentation is countered by a dagger in the back of Bushido Blade's innovative gameplay.  I've always been a fan of samurai drama, ever since my father brought home a copy of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai from the library and made me watch it.  Or at any rate, he made me watch about the first ten minutes or so.  The rest I stuck with on my own.  Kengo perfectly replicates the kind of flavor I've loved about samurai film and manga.  Lightweight has canned the hokey modern-day setting of the Bushido Blades in favor of a proper 18th-century world - now you're a proper Tokugawa-era kenshi, instead of some weird cartoon character in basketball shorts.  But dammit, they put life bars in this game.  Life bars, silly death-blow attacks, strange camera shifts, shrunken arenas...didn't the creators realize what solid gold they'd struck with the original Bushido Blade?  Perhaps not.  Presentation  I'll begin, though, with what I love the most about Kengo, the setting and structure of its single-player mode.  There's a tournament mode if you want to get straight into the thick of things, but the real rewards available are found by taking a novice student and training him to become a master swordsman.  After picking one of three characters, each with a different balance of abilities, you then get to select your dojo, the school of the sword where you'll study.  There are about a dozen different schools, and depending on which one you'll pick, you learn different attacks as you progress.  Some schools are slow and defensive, some focus on combination attacks, others emphasize concentration on a single stroke - your style will evolve accordingly.  The training sequences that follow might equal the Gran Turismo license tests in terms of aggravation, if they weren't so freaking cool.  The tests that actually raise your attributes fall victim to some of the problems in the proper swordfighting system (more on that later), but the mini-game training sequences that raise your stat maximums are seriously addictive.  Each one raises a particular stat, save for the Illusion game, which gives a little boost to everything.  Break down a thick wooden pole with Dance Dance Revolution button-presses to kick up your attack power; slice down a forest of bamboo to gain agility; stand naked under a waterfall mashing buttons to build your spirit; time button presses to snuff out a circle of candles in the aforementioned Illusion game; and, finally, Zen meditation.  Yes, Zazen.  The little twitch element is a balance meter - you have to sit perfectly straight while in the midst of contemplation, or the monk behind you wallops you upside the head and you don't gain any insight points.  The rhythm of the training mode, from mini-games to actual tests and back, is very absorbing, even when you get to some of the more frustrating later tests - I hate that bloody beat-ten-enemies-in-a-row test.  As you take each trial, though, you gain more attacks and improve your skills, so practice does help you eventually overcome the tests.  And even if you do have a hard time, it's still fun to just drink in the atmosphere, both of the training mode and your later trials against real opponents.  The period flavor of the dojo, the tournaments, the impromptu duels in the streets, and formal combat against opposing schools is always well-executed and very absorbing.  Graphics  The forests, training halls, and streets are all rendered very well in 3D, as are the wide variety of competing duelists - if only they'd just made a Bushido Blade that looked this good.  Kengo is actually not at the forefront of PS2 games, especially when it comes to handling aliasing and interlace flicker, but the character models are pretty realistic, and there are spots of brilliance amid the generally above-average animation.  The response animations for parries and blocks often correspond surprisingly well to the attacks they're deflecting, and there are wonderful bits of cinematic animation in the training sequences and other interludes.  Watching a student sit down in the Zazen mini-game makes me wonder how much time Lightweight spent modeling all the sharp, precise movements.  The combat sequences aren't so fluid - you can see a little chop in many transitions - but the number of animations is still remarkable.  As in Bushido Blade, you have a great many attacks depending on your sword school, stance, and different button/D-pad combinations, and Kengo adds several special parry and counterattack animations - one school, for example, has a nifty maneuver where the fighter ties up his opponent's sword and swiftly kicks him in the gut.  The environments, though, are a sticking point, simply because they aren't very big.  Kengo takes place in free-roaming 3D environments, but they're not part of the expansive, continuous world Bushido Blade had - instead, they're about as big as Soul Calibur's.  The modeling and lighting effects are nicely spare, but given the power of the system this game is running on, it stands to reason that recreating Bushido Blade's environments wouldn't have been too difficult.  Sound  At least the traditional soundtrack is preserved.  All the music is suitable for the period (koto, samisen, shakuhachi, everything that you'd expect), and the clash of swords mixed with shouted kiai makes for perfect accentuation.  Crave, thankfully, has chosen not to repeat the mistake made with the second Bushido Blade, and left all of the spoken dialogue in the original Japanese.  It makes perfect sense, given that this is a thoroughly Japanese game set in Japan, but after Kessen, it seems as if you can't assume too much.  Gameplay  For example, you can't assume anyone recognizes a great idea even when they come up with it themselves, for here is where the trouble begins.  Bushido Blade was genuinely innovative in several ways.  It had unprecedentedly large and complex arenas, it allowed considerable freedom of movement around them, and most of all, it did away with life bars.  That last one had a drastic effect on gameplay, both the mechanics and psychological effect thereof - you could kill or be killed at any time, which was as realistic a concept in fighting games as there ever had been.  Bushido Blade was not perfect, certainly.  Chief among its problems was the difficulty of reconciling precise and responsive character facing with the freedom of movement the areas and the run system afforded.  It was often hard to quickly move around in 3D and then re-orient yourself to attack your opponent while they were still vulnerable, resulting in that classic tactic against the computer where you would simply run around them in circles slashing at random until an attack landed.  What Kengo has done, for reasons I can't begin to fathom, is remove the positive, innovative qualities from Bushido Blade and actually accentuate some of its serious failings.  Life bars have been introduced, and the facing problem is made even worse by some peculiarities of control and a new camera system that changes the movement and attack controls at the drop of a hat.  I just can't figure out why they should decide to change all these things - to break what was not broken, and break the broken stuff even further.  The life bar issue, admittedly, could be argued either way.  Much of the effect of the lack of life bars in the first game was psychological, after all.  That element was a signifier of the fact that you could die in one stroke, which was the real issue in gameplay.  Kengo, though, along with the addition of life bars, seems to have changed the damage balance to eliminate the one-hit kills.  The damage balance now reminds me of one of the more lethal Samurai Spirits games, perhaps III.  There are still attacks that will do a significant amount of damage, more than half your life bar, but you can score a hit that looks like it should cleave your opponent in twain and they'll still be coming back for more.  This steals the individuality that made Bushido Blade what it was - Kengo seems to be moving closer to the realm of ~really clumsy traditional fighting game,~ which is not where it ought to be.  Furthermore, the issue of camera control and movement is inarguable.  Thanks to the smaller arenas - indoor halls and limited outdoor clearings - the camera doesn't have a fixed perspective.  At times, it will frame the action with both characters on either side, while in others, it will pull up to a kind of over-the-shoulder view.  When the camera shifts like that, the directional controls are suddenly rotated 90 degrees, for both the D-pad and analog stick.  To have to adjust to that change in the middle of the fight is extremely aggravating, since getting your character to face properly, especially against a moving opponent, is far too clumsy an affair.  What does Kengo do right?  Well, there's certainly potential in its evolution of the stance system in Bushido Blade.  Your swordsman has four different stances, each corresponding to one shoulder button and the three-stroke combination that's the central attack in that particular stance.  As you develop a character in the single-player mode, they learn a wider variety of strokes that you can build into custom combinations, one for each stance.  This is an interesting system, giving you a lot of opportunities to tinker with different attacks and create a varied offense, but some of its potential is stolen by the facing problems.  Thrusts and downward slashes so often miss by this much, because your character won't track their opponent properly.  Fights often devolve into a sort of Keystone Kops affair of fighters comboing past each other like ships in the night.  The traditional combat is irritating enough that the special attacks, while problematic, almost seem like an afterthought on the list of problems with Kengo.  It is worth noting, though, that big silly motion-blurring insta-kill attacks should not appear in a fighting game that wants to be taken seriously.  They don't appear half as often as they did in the early demo versions of the game that we played (thank God), but they shouldn't be here at all. Here's a question to ponder, though - view Kengo in a vacuum, separate from the heritage I expect it to live up to, and what then?  I, of course, am singularly ill-equipped to provide a worthwhile answer for this question.  But the way I look at it, I envision people reacting to this game in two ways.  They will want a fighting game, and they will be disappointed by what moves Kengo outside the realm of faster, more traditional one-on-one fighters, or they will want the king of serious simulator that Bushido Blade was, and they will be disappointed about the changes that move the game back towards the mainstream.  It's as if Kengo's creators have tried to walk the line between audiences, and wound up pleasing neither.It's a heartbreaker, because a game that looked like this, included these kinds of presentation and scenario elements, and played like Bushido Blade would receive my highest recommendation.  I'd play it to death. What might have been is not what is, though.  Perhaps I'll go back for another few sessions under the waterfall, but most of the rest of Kengo I'll have to write off as a loss.", "date": "Dec 23, 2000"}
