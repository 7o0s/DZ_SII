Unfortunately, it was somewhat overshadowed by some of the more established franchises in its genre, namely Warlords and Heroes of Might and Magic. As a result, fan support was light, and without a whole lot of cool user-created scenarios to overcome the lack of a random map generator, the game ultimately dropped from view.   Well as the title of this article would suggest, the folks over at Triumph Studios have completed a sequel, Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne, and done a pretty good job with it too. So what's new? Is this a vast leap forward, the next thing in strategy gaming?    Not really. There are some major new features -- and we'll get to those -- but for the most part AoW II is just more of the same. Almost everything you do here is something you've already done before, be it in Master of Magic, HOMM, or even Age of Wonders I. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not the way to win awards, either.    Getting Started  Anyway for those of you unfamiliar with the basic premise of the game, here's the gist of it. You are a Wizard. You choose one of seven magical Spheres to specialize in -- Life, Death, Air, Water, Fire, Earth and Carl Sagan's favorite, the Cosmos Sphere. Each Sphere (except Cosmos) has its own kind of attack, summon, and other spells, and you also choose a couple of Master of Magic-type special abilities or disadvantages, such as +20% population growth in all your towns, or an extra ten casting points per round (probably one of the better ones). The Cosmos Sphere works a little differently, but the details are too dull to get into here.   Next you choose a race to play: elves, dwarves, men or whatever -- there are twelve races in all. The Lizard Men and Azracs from the first game have vanished, replaced by Draconians, Archons, and Tigrans. As you might expect, the Draconians are Dragon Men, while the Archons are a weird mix of the Roman Empire and Angelic Seraphim. And not surprisingly Tigrans are anthropomorphic cat people. In other words they're Furries. Ugh.    Once you've chosen a race of people, you start off in your city, cranking out basic military units and trying to build up your magic, gold, and armies. In the early going, you'll split your troops up and fan out all over the map, grabbing important resource points like mines and power nodes that add to your incomes. Along the way, you'll recruit and summon Heroes to lead your armies, equip them with magic items, and send them on quests to get more. Ultimately though what it comes down to is shoving stacks of high-powered units into your enemy's towns and burning them to the ground.   So far, doesn't sound all that much different from many other fantasy strategy games you've played. So what's new?    What's New  Well one thing is the individual combat units are absolutely loaded with special abilities, immunities, and other little nuances that make playing each race's armies quite a different experience indeed. Elven troops race through the forest twice as fast as the others, Dwarves clamber freely over mountains, and some of the Undead troops spring back to life in the middle of battle, just to name a few. This means you have to pay a lot more attention to your units' advantages and tailor your forces towards your enemy's weaknesses. You might even wait to fight a battle until it can be fought on terrain favorable to you, since some units fight better in deserts, or have penalties in snowdrifts. Your army may consist of the greatest swordsmen in the world, but if you can't hit the flying, fire-breathing dragon, fat lot of good it does you.    On the other hand, the actual cities and city improvements themselves are identical from race to race, even if a city is underground as opposed to being above the earth, surrounded by lava or built out on the ice. Walls, it seems, are walls, whether built by Elves, Dwarves, or Cat People. Somehow, that doesn't seem to add up.   Another new feature in the sequel is the ability to create Pioneer units, who can then be sent out to found new Outposts (level one cities), ala Civilization or Master of Magic. This is an intriguing new element, but the AI players don't seem to take advantage of it much, and generally the way the scenarios are set up, for the most part you're not going to bother with Pioneers either -- there are too many neutral cities on the map, and it's quicker and more cost-efficient to merely grab those and then migrate your own player race in, if their alignment is radically different than yours.    That's because it only takes a few turns to completely replace the existing population with your own kind, something you'll want to do because otherwise people tend to rebel unless they're the same alignment as you, or you heavily garrison a city.   In fact, pretty much the only reason you might not choose to replace a conquered city's population with your own as soon as possible would be to get access to some of their special units.    And this isn't a game that favors sitting back collecting garrisons. You have to constantly have your troops out in the move, preferably deep in enemy territory, seizing and even razing their towns and income centers. You can even destroy their manna nodes, really creating an economic squeeze.     But other than that, combat isn't really all that different from Age of Wonders I. The biggest change in the tactical mini-game seems to be the ability for any unit to attack a wall or a gate and bring it down. Not the most elegant solution in the world for what was a big problem in the first game (the AI would attack your walled towns with adequate siege weapons quite a bit), but at least it works.    The Domain  Probably the biggest new feature this game introduces is the concept of a Wizard's Domain. The Domain is defined as those hexagons that your Wizard can cast his overland spells in. This area increases with the number and quality of Wizard Towers you build, and the number of Magic Relays you possess. It shows up on the map as regions of territory surrounded by colored borders.   The problem with the whole concept of Domains is that it makes the game feel less like some massive, fantasy epic, and more like some sort of electrical power grid management simulation. You're forced to game the map from a more strategic point of view, paying attention to the little colored borders that mark the edges of the Domains. Well, this causes several problems. For one thing, the borders fluctuate from round to round, as Magic Relays change hands, NPCs move, and improvements are made. Furthermore, the borders overlap.    And to make matters worse, you don't hit F7 or something to get a different map that has just the colored overlays representing each Wizard's zone of control. Instead there's a zoom in/zoom out feature that doesn't do much except show you just how ugly sprites look when they're not displayed at the correct resolution. The interface simply doesn't do a good job at showing the borders.   Also disappointing -- and this was a factor in the first game too -- is the near uselessness of the diplomacy screen. It seems like it doesn't make any difference what you do, or how Good you are, as soon as you run into an enemy Wizard, they declare war on you. The lack of any kind of meaningful diplomatic model makes the whole point of trying to be Good somewhat moot. If the Domain boundaries had any sort of relation to diplomatic model, then both might have been more appealing. Theoretically, you could be warned against sending your    But in virtually every game I played, my troops were constantly crossing over into other Wizards' domains (knowingly or suddenly finding themselves in there by accident), and it never really seemed to matter. I was almost always at war with everyone anyway.   That's not to say Domains have no game effect at all, because that's not true. They mark the bounds of your magical influence, so any creatures you summon can be dropped anywhere in your domain, and the overland Mastery spells are bound by these artificial boundaries. Still, it feels like a tacked on concept that doesn't add much more than another layer of abstraction onto the existing game.     The Rest  Scenario design seems to have slipped a bit this time out, too. Many of the scenarios are far too rigid in forcing the player to play as a particular race on a particular map, and the manual warns you against customizing your wizard and race too much if you want to play particular scenarios. I was particularly miffed at the inability to customize your own wizard in many cases, because they came up with some real duds for names. Uh oh, it's Nekron, take a guess what his specialty? Do you think Arctica might be good with frost powers? You can't even customize the names of conquered towns or the new Heroes that answer your call. BORING.   So while overall the art direction of the game does the fantasy world justice, little nitpicky problems like keep popping up and destroying the illusion, constantly reminding you that what you're playing is some sort of super-elaborate strategic wargame with a lot of computer dice-rolling and stat-tracking. Sure, strategy games are in one sense just math problems, but they should be fun math problems, with flavor and story and all the rest of it.   Anyway, continuing on with art direction. The sound effects get a little repetitive, particularly the movement acknowledgement cues for the low-level minions. I almost stopped playing as the Goblins altogether, just to stop that little guy from barking in my ear every ten seconds. And if you play as the Elves, the Nymph sound cues are too funny for words.    One the flip side, music is handled very considerately. The actual number of MP3s shipped with the game aren't that many (there aren't even race specific tunes, just Sphere songs), but you can use the game's built in player to play any MP3 in the music directory. Let me tell you, any fantasy game sounds a whole lot better with the Fellowship of the Rings soundtrack running in the background. For people sick and tired of inadequate game soundtracks, that's reason enough to pick up this game.    The game's graphics can be a lot of fun too. One of the coolest things in the original game was the Frost Witch, who actually transformed the terrain type of the hexagons she passed through. There's a new Undead unit who can now do this too, and it's fun to transform the happy, fuzzy forest into the blasted depths of Mordor.   But there are plenty of annoyances too. While they look decent (and can support the truly gigantic screen resolutions), they're not all that different in overall appearance from the first game, which came out a couple years ago. More to the point, the map occasionally gets too busy and crowded, so much so that for the first few hours of the game, you will be constantly clicking guys into the wrong hex. Yes, you can hit F4 to toggle grid on and off (a fact omitted from the manual), but you shouldn't really have to. Things simply have to be more clear.   I also didn't like how sometimes you could right click on things to get information, and other times you couldn't, and there really isn't any well to learn the rhyme or reason. So overall, the interface could use some work.    In Conclusion  So like I said in the beginning, Age of Wonders II: The Wizard's Throne is a good game, and it'll be better after it gets patched -- but there simply isn't enough new stuff here to make you feel like you haven't already played this game before, and what new stuff there is (settlers, Domains), feel either tacked on or messy.   What do I mean by new stuff? Well take the whole Underground-Aboveground thing. The previous game actually had two different subterranean levels as well as a surface lair. This time, we're actually reduced to one subterranean level, presumably because it was getting tedious to be marching guys across three separate different 2D planes. So they took one level out.   Well that's not a very innovative solution, is it? Maybe a new kind of unit that actually opened up new tunnels from the underground to the aboveground would've been more interesting. Maybe a 3D engine with rotating terrain would do a better job at conveying the three-dimensionality of the subterranean world. It certainly would help if the player could zoom in and rotate around some of those cities, to figure exactly what hex our parties our landing in.   Now that's just an example, and probably not a very good one. But the point stands -- show me something new. Don't leave me feeling like I've already played this game.  Age of Wonders II is a good, solid game, and if you're new to the turn-based, fantasy strategy genre, you should have a lot of fun with it. But if you've been playing the handful of games that come out in this genre every year, you're going to be hit with a disappointing sense of dj vu.", "date": "Jun 24, 2002"}
