I suspect the answer would differ a great deal depending on the respondent, but personally, I really think of three broad styles of music. First up, new romantic. I'm talking Spandau Ballet, Duran Duran and Adam & The Ants. The 80s was a decade of atrocious clothing and garish colours, and these kinds of bands were at the forefront of teen and young adult culture. Hell, when I think of the quintessential 80s films, it's The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles and Pretty in Pink that spring to mind, all of which had soundtracks chock full of this kind of synthesised pop, and which helped make new romantic emblematic of the decade. The other two broad styles of music that spring to mind are metal, in particular the likes of Iron Maiden, Twisted Sister and Judas Priest, and hip hop.   Now, we can obviously strike hip hop from the record, because aside from some heavy guitar riffs on the Beastie Boys' Licensed to Ill and on Run DMC records, it's not exactly a genre suited to Guitar Hero. Metal, on the other hand, is perfect for GH and is represented in abundance in Rocks the 80s (with all three of the bands mentioned with tracks in the game), as it has been in previous Guitar Hero games. Sadly though, new romantic is very poorly represented, and the end result is a game that just isn't iconic enough in its 80s-ness. In short, this could almost be any Guitar Hero game - where are the nasal male vocals, weedy sampled drums and synthesisers that so characterised the decade? It's not even like I particularly like new romantic, but at the very least, including some of the signature tracks would give the game more personality.     It's a negative introduction certainly, but it seems bizarre that this game would focus on rock and metal to the exclusion of such archetypal 80s music. You may argue that the more synth-orientated tunes wouldn't work so well, but we'd be willing to take the gamble, simply because the line-up in Rocks the 80s is the weakest yet. For our money, the original Guitar Hero still has the best selection of tracks, with classics like More Than a Feeling, Godzilla, Symphony of Destruction and Ziggy Stardust, while Guitar Hero II was a little weaker, but still memorable, especially for the likes of Monkey Wrench, Free Bird, Strutter and in its 360 incarnation, Possum Kingdom. Even so, both had way more hits than misses, and you'd keep coming back to those classic tracks over and over again, because they were just so much fun to play.   That simply isn't the case here. The tracks that I restarted after completing them, just for the hell of it, are few and far between, and despite the focus on rock and metal, there aren't many tracks based around blazing solos, unlike earlier releases. Perhaps some Joe Satriani or Yngwie Malmsteen would have helped fill the void? In any case, even if there are few true standouts, there are still a number of solid and fun tracks to play, and while there isn't much in the way of new romantic (although Flock of Seagulls' ~I Ran (So Far Away)~ and Oingo Boingo's ~Only a Lad~ do make it in, the latter being a bit of a disappointment), there's definitely still a good helping of 80s cheese, such as Scorpions' ~No One Likes You~, Asia's ~Heat of the Moment~ and The Vapours' ~Turning Japanese~. Other genres represented are '80s wuss rock', including Scandal's ~The Warrior~ and .38 Special's ~Hold on Loosely~, poppy tracks like The Go Gos' ~We Got the Beat~ and The Romantics' ~What I Like About You~ and catchy rock, such as The Police's ~Synchronicity II~. And let's not forget Radar Love, as made famous by The Simpsons, and ~Ballroom Blitz~, as made famous by Wayne's World. It's the harder tunes which are both the highlight and some of the weakest content. It's cool playing the Dead Kennedys' ~Police Truck~ and Anthrax's ~Caught in a Mosh~, while the driving bassline and lead-focused guitar work on Iron Maiden's ~Wrathchild~ is a definite highlight, but then Twisted Sister's ~I Wanna Rock~, which is such an anthemic track, just falls flat when you actually play it, as does Dio's ~Holy Diver~.     It's a mixed bag, let down further by the fact that there are only 30 tracks, with no bonus tracks to purchase - far less than on Guitar Hero II. We also have to say that only four master recordings out of 30 just isn't good enough any more, and the fact that a lot of the covers are quite weak just rubs salt into the wounds. Another issue for Guitar Hero fans is the fact that the difficulty curve takes a long time to ramp up. You'll cruise through the vast majority of the game without any real problems, which leaves long term fans wanting more, while newcomers would still be better off getting their hands on one of the earlier releases.   The presentation of the game is basically a carbon copy of Guitar Hero II - the look of the venues and characters have been given a bit of an 80s overhaul, but not enough to make it feel distinct. The gameplay, also, is identical - not that this is a bad thing, but with Guitar Hero III around the corner, complete with power-ups and the like, this release just feels like treading water.For all our whinging, Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s is still worth a look for fans desperate for some new tunes to sink their fingers into. Its just not as iconic as we would have expected, nor is it as compelling. The RRP of AU $69.95 is also just on the edge of too much for this release. At AU $49.95 it would have been good value, but as it is, $69.95 is a lot to pay for a somewhat vanilla expansion pack.", "date": "Jul 26, 2007"}
