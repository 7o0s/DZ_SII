And it looks great.  Unfortunately, this is about as far as the game gets in terms of innovation. While the animation does look great, it tends to slow down the on-court action, throwing off the control and frustrating all who experience it. In its defense, Shoot Out has included lots of simulation options, like a season mode, and a full roster of realistic players who perform close to their actual abilities.  While Shoot Out has made a valiant effort to improve upon the basketball game, NBA Live '96 still holds the crown for the best basketball game around. A good try though.
