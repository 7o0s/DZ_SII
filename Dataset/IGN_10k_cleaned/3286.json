{"name": "Minority Report", "name_review": "Minority Report: Everybody Runs", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/27/minority-report-everybody-runs", "text": "Earlier this year, Steven Spielberg released a smashing sci-fi movie featuring Tom Cruise.  In a world where violent crime is predicted by three psychics (pre-cogs) before it happens, there has not been a murder in over five years.  When one of Precrime's own, John Anderton, is convicted of committing a future murder, the tenets of precrime are shaken.  Anderton, like every other convicted pre-criminal, runs and the Precrime Division gives chase.  Sounds like a promising video game premise.  Unfortunately, Treyarch's Minority Report fails to capture the marvel of its movie counterpart, and even worse, doesn't offer many thrills in yet another failed movie-turned-video-game endeavor.  Features  Loosely follows movie plot, offering it's own twists and turns Dozens of combo moves Buy attack upgrades and weapons on the black market Awesome effects look just like the movie Clancy Brown (of Highlander fame) voices John Anderton   Gameplay Without the rights to Tom Cruise's likeness, Treyarch made a unique version of John Anderton, one a bit more reminiscent of Splinter Cell's Sam Fischer than the young and spry Mr. Cruise.  The story takes many elements of the movie, but tries to tell its own tale.  It succeeds for the most part in telling a slightly different tale than the one told for the movie, but the telling of this tale is quite poor.  If you've never seen or heard of the movie, you may be completely lost, since there's no explanation about pre-cogs or precrime.  Action happens and you've got to follow.  The rest of the cut-scenes follow in a similar fashion of offering little real information or story elements.  That's fine for an action game, since it's the gameplay that really matters, but it would have been nice to see such a solid movie storyline given at least some attention.  The fascinating near-future, Precrime, and anything that might be mistaken for a moral are ignored.  Minority Report boasts 40 levels, but in all honesty, you can finish the game in under 10-hours.  Yes, the levels are often that short.  Taking the tag line ~everybody runs~ to heart, Minority Report offers many levels where you can simply run past Precrime officers and head for the exit.  That's actually a good thing, because hey, Anderton doesn't want to fight these people, he wants answers.  But the level-design in these ~go ahead and run instead of fighting~ levels aren't done right.  They are often very small arenas and your opposition can easily be avoided with a slide or jump.  Some levels can be finished in under a minute this way.  Then at other times, particularly later in the game, you will have no choice but to fight.  That's fine too, but it would be nice to see more levels designed where the idea is to get away, not kick everybody's ass.  If nothing other than to offer something different than your typical action boxing match and to fit more in the mold of the movie.    Fortunately the fighting engine is entertaining.  Using a system similar to one found in Spider-Man, players have a variety of available combos.  You can jump (Y), strong attack (B), quick attack (A), and grab/block (X).  You can grab baddies and beat them up or throw them about; crashing them through glass windows and other destructible objects feels great. Combos are of the three-button variety and a number of new ones can be bought on the black market with money you collect in each level. Money is often hid in ~secret~ rooms, where you might have to bust a window to access it. So, this helps extend the gameplay a little.     Rarely will you fight one man (or robot or mechanical spider) at a time.  Instead you are quite often surrounded, hit from all sides.  This is the one thing that makes battles tough (actually, getting shot at from long range doesn't make it any easier).  However, there's a very simple cheat to fights that works, unfortunately, the majority of the time.  Squeeze the left trigger as you run and you will slide.  You can knock down several adversaries this way and continue to slide into them as they try to get up off the ground.  You can generally get through a majority of battles with this technique.  It's cheap, it's easy, and it's a sign of a fighting engine not properly balanced. It reminds us a lot of how clunky old 2D NES games were, actually. The whole game for that matter seems rather obvious and, often,   While you will often fight humans in the form of thugs or Precrime officers, you'll also have to contend with the mechanical spiders who, in the movie, were there to scan your retina for an ID, but in the game jump onto you and electrocute you (or explode).  And then there are the big bad robot guards who can't be knocked over with the slide tackle and can barely be hurt with punches and kicks.  For these, you need your weapons arsenal.  Minority Report doesn't offer a large variety of guns, but there's enough there (about a half-dozen) to keep things interesting.  Guns often aren't easy to come by, so conserving shots is necessary.  Many guns are from the movie; the ones with the cool effects that knock people backwards, the rocket launchers, and even a machine pistol to dispense of your pursuers.  Switching weapons is easy with a press of the D-Pad and aiming requires holding down the right trigger.  You can switch targets by pressing the C-stick, which doesn't always make for the best way to cycle through targets.  Still, guns are easy to use, effective, and certainly an enjoyable change from all the kicking and punching. Overall, however, the mechanics just feel a bit too stuff.  There are also some issues with the presentation. As we noted previously, you can cheat the system and beat many of your adversaries with the slide tackle. But, there's an even easier way to dispense of troublesome humans.  Grab a stunned opponent (or slide tackle and grab a fallen opponent) and throw them off a rooftop or down a flight of stairs.  This is instant death and goes against the entire premise of Minority Report.  Game or movie, this is the story of a guy trying to prove his future-innocence.  With the exception of a single, potential turncoat, no one in Precrime is doing anything wrong -- they are doing their job.  But here, you toss people off roofs like they are useless, evil beings.  You kill often and you kill indiscriminately and there is no penalty or change in the story.  It's almost like this was originally intended to be a different game and suddenly the Minority Report license was obtained and a new skin was thrown over another story.  It's inconsistent, not just with the movie, but with the game's storyline as well.  As for the AI, it's decent but mostly troubling.  Enemies will certainly surround you and an enemy with a gun will try and keep his distance and take you out before you can reach him.  Usually enemies don't stand around waiting on you, they move to meet you.  However, there are many times where you will run past an enemy and rather than give chase, they will turn their back to you and act as if they are suddenly on guard duty.  But that's nothing compared to the sudden ruthless nature of the Precrime Division.  Precrime officers with guns are constantly shooting their own men in the back.  There's a boss-battle with one of the hover copters where the vehicle mows down several friendlies just to get poor John Anderton.    One interesting, but poorly implemented, idea is the black market.  Like the movie, the black market plays a role in Minority Report.  By finding cash hidden throughout each level you can purchase health boosts, weapons, fighting combos, and even temporary power-ups.  But rather than having a true black market integrated into gameplay, where you perhaps have to find people who can sell you stuff in the back of alleys, you simply need pause the game and purchase something instantly from the black market.  Need some armor?  Pause, buy, and there it is.  Not a big deal since this is clearly not meant as some genre-breaking action title, but there seem to be several better ways to handle a black market buy than something this quick and uninteresting.  But that's the problem with Minority Report, it takes the quick and easy way far too often.  In the end, Minority Report: Everybody Runs isn't nearly as cerebral as the Spielberg directed movie. With a hazy storyline and simple, formulaic gameplay, the experience is something that few will want to stick with to the end. It's worth checking out at the local rental store, but whether you're a fan of the movie or just looking for some action it's not a recommended buy.    Graphics Minority Report: Everybody Runs is somewhat unbalanced in the graphics department. The levels are fairly confined and uninteresting in design, but there are a number of effects that dazzle.  The concussion rifle and riot impact shotgun effects look like they were ripped straight from the movie.  They can be a little too much at times, but the distortion of the world around the huge blasts has a nice effect. You'll see other particles like smoke that work equally well. The problem is that most of the rest of the game isn't very attractive at all.  The textures are blotchy, the framerate frequently drags, and there's quite a bit of noticeable clipping.  In fact, the spectacular effects make the rest of the game look even more inferior. The two don't match.   More visual candy comes in the form of the ~ragdoll effect~. Basically when you toss bodies or knock them away with concussive blasts, they will go completely limp. It's meant to not look as awkward or lethargic as stiff bodies falling over. Unfortunately, it's completely overboard. It's on the completely opposite side of the spectrum from being stiff, and the boneless goons look more like they're caught in a vacuum, flopping around in a very ridiculous fashion. It happens to you (John Anderton) in the middle of fights. So you'll be punching some guy, and he'll thrust you backward, which causes your body to go limp, legs flailing and all. It's just a clumsily implemented effect.  Like the rest of the game, despite all the shiny windows and the light-bending tricks, Minority Report's visuals are rushed and uneven.   Sound It's the same story with the sound; a barely present soundtrack and shoddy effects don't mix. On the one hand, Clancy Brown does a fine job stepping in for Tom Cruise, offering the much more hard-nosed smack-you-in-the-face agent John Anderton.  He's the strongest voice talent in the game by far, with the rest of the cast sounding like the same old so-so talent found in every other action game on the market.    As for the sound effects and score, though, they are very minimal.  In fact, you'll have to wonder if much of any budget was spent on sound it's so sparse.  It would have been nice to hear some music kick up during intense fight scenes, but instead things stay calm and quiet.  The best sound in the whole game is the unabashedly cheesy screams enemies offer when thrown off a building or to a lower level of a building.  ~I'm faaaaaalling!~   It does seemingly support Dolby Pro Logic II pretty well. As we rotated the free roaming camera it was very clear where certain sounds were coming from. Minority Report is a great movie and definitely a license that could have become a fantastic game.  Perhaps the first mistake was trying to find a balance between the movie and doing something new.  Treyarch should probably have decided to either do a near-direct translation of the movie or done a wholly different story, one that borrowed the context of the world but not many of the plot elements of the movie.  Instead, they did a bit of this and that and the result is a weak story and overall mediocre level design.  There's certainly some nice potential in Minority Report, but the game is essentially half good and half bad with little in the middle.  The fighting engine seems decent enough, entirely reminiscent of Spider-Man, and the guns are pretty cool, but then the presentation is sparser than many other action games and ideas like the black market aren't implemented well at all.  The graphics are the same with some outstanding weapon effects and destructible objects but the floppy rag doll bodies are horrible, the textures blotchy, and the slowdown unattractive.  A mixed-bag, but not worth your hard-earned cash.  A weekend rental, but not one for your collection.", "date": "Nov 27, 2002"}
