The latest entrant into Konami's ever-expanding library of rhythm-based games is Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Channel Edition. Boot up the game and you'll find 20 songs from an array of Disney movies and shows -- along with three Konami tracks -- and have the opportunity to play in a plethora of modes with goals such as losing weight, unlocking outfits and finding more songs. When all is said and done, there are 40 songs on this disc.     What's that? You've been in a coma since 1970, woke up four months ago, have only been watching Disney Channel and are clueless as to what DDR is? Well, you poor bastard, Dance Dance Revolution is the arcade hit come home that challenges you to rest your thumbs and freak your feet. See, arrows scroll up on your TV screen and you have to tap a corresponding arrow icon on the gigantic mat you're standing on. Your moves appear on screen, and the game gives you points -- as well as visual clues such as ~Boo~ and ~Great~ -- for how in tune your stomps are with the beat. Make it through the whole song -- a groove meter on the screen lets you know how close you are to failing out -- and your score is broken down.    So, yeah. If you know DDR, it's the same basic control scheme that's launched a million dance-offs. Thankfully, this Disney version of the game isn't dumbed down for the obviously younger crowd when it comes to gameplay. There are still frantic arrow switches, moves where you'll need to hold the note and all the other DDR standbys you'd expect.   What is new to the Disney version of this game besides the 14 characters such as Kim from Kim Possible, Gabriella from High School Musical and an assortment of other basic cable stars reppin' shows such as Hannah Montana, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, That's so Raven and the Cheetah Girls? That'd be Magic Mode.   My eyes! Basically a single-player career option, Magic Mode has you choose your favorite Disney dancer and challenge another Disney icon. You'll get three songs and if you beat the computerized opponent, you'll unlock that person's special outfit. However, this mode is also where combo effects come into play.   The groove meter is on any game screen you're going to see while playing DDR, but Magic Mode adds a combo meter. Step on a bunch of arrows without getting a ~Good~ or worse, and both meters get a boost. Now, while all this is happening, there's a countdown in the lower portion of the screen. If that number hits zero (it's counting down from ten) and your combo meter is full, one of several combo effects -- stuff such as speeding the steps up or rotating the arrows -- will be deployed on your opponent.    Mu-ha-ha! Take that, 11-year-old Hannah Montana fan!    The good times don't end with Magic Mode though. Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Channel Edition also packs a free play mode where you can choose your desired track and difficulty to take on the computer or a friend, a training mode to practice songs at different speeds and the mass media-attention-grabbing workout mode that has you enter your weight and play for as long as you want, until you burn a user-set amount of calories or until a specific amount of times passes.    There's also an advanced mode where you can either play through a preset course of songs, play for as long as you can with only four continues, play only as long as you can keep a combo going or play until the dance meter runs out.     Thankfully, Konami recognized that there's probably going to be a bunch of DDR virgins demanding mom and dad buy this game and tossed a 24-part lesson mode in that will teach non-believers the way of DDR -- this is a tool that wasn't even included in the last PS2 DDR, SuperNova2.   It's obvious that if your cable box is constantly tuned to Disney and you're hankering to bounce around your living room, this game is probably right up your alley -- but like the decision to put anyone related to Britney Spears in a starring role, there are problems beneath the surface.   To begin with, this version of DDR is not attractive. The characters are jaggy, cel-shaded versions of their TV counterparts similar to High School Musical: Sing It!. While that isn't terrible by itself, the models are then placed on top of a similarly colored background where they prance around as retina-burning colors and images -- I'm talking about zooms and pans on images of Corbin Bleu -- move across the screen, arrows scroll and meters fill.    It's neon overload and can make focusing on the gameplay difficult.   My next complaint is all about the game's music. Now, I don't mean song selection -- if you like Disney music, that's awesome and the tracks here sound perfect. I'm talking about the number of tracks. DDR SuperNova2 featured 70 songs for you to get your groove on with, and that makes the 40 found here rather disappointing. Isn't singing all they do in High School Musical? Couldn't we have put a few more tracks on here?   Mmmm, pea soup! SuperNova2 also out performs this Disney edition when it comes to an online mode  namely because SuperNova2 has an online mode and the Disney edition doesn't. Now, I understand that this edition is aimed at the young ones and having them chat it up with some guy who's been on a recent episode of Dateline isn't the best idea, but I have to imagine that the current online infrastructure for SuperNova2 could have been neutered -- like the song library -- to meet the desire of kids who want to play kids.Even though Dance Dance Revolution: Disney Edition outperforms its latest predecessor -- DDR SuperNova 2 -- by offering a training mode, it still falls short of the traditional DDR standard in terms of song selection, online play and visual flair. It's not a bad game -- jumping around the mat and trying to pull off insane combos is as fun as ever -- but the product is clearly a DDR starter pack. That isn't a bad thing but charging as much as a full-fledged, tricked-out DDR is.", "date": "Jan 15, 2008"}
