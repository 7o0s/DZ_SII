We don't have that answer for you. It remains one of life's great mysteries. What we do know is that Eets is the star of a new puzzle game for Xbox Live Arcade and he loves marshmallows. We also have an affinity for marshmallows, so things are off to a good start.    If you've played Lemmings before, you have a good idea of what to expect out of Eets. Like the game that clearly inspired it, the goal is to guide Eets to the end of a stage, avoiding pits, traps, and other obstacles. Each map has a unique puzzle as well as an assortment of items that perform various functions for you to position around the screen. Once you start Eets walking, you can't control him and it is up to your clever placement and use of the items you're given to guide Eets to safety. As the game progresses, new tools are put at your disposal alongside more difficult level design so that the end stages are significantly harder than the opening ones.    Eets does several things exceptionally well. The first is the cartoony look and crazy items put at your disposal. The prankster whale will suck up objects when activated and spit them out through its blow hole. The choco cloud can be used as a small platform, or with an attached nozzle can spit out chocolate chips which can be used in a variety of ways. Marshmallows can make Eets frightened enough to avoid walking off of ledges or hyper active enough to jump great distances depending upon their color. It's all a bit insane, but that also adds to the fun.    Guide Eets to the puzzle piece to complete the stage. There is one way to pass each puzzle that the designers originally intended players to use. In fact, you can pause the game at any time and ask to see that solution. This in itself is a bit odd as you can just ask the computer to solve all 123 puzzles and waltz though collecting Achievements. Thankfully, there is more than one way to skin a cat. In fact, some of the better Achievements in Eets were created to take advantage of this. Though you have a certain number of items to use in solving each puzzle, not all of them are actually required. Several of the achievements involve completing a number of puzzles with one, two, or even three pieces left in your toolbox. This, along with leaderboard score which is based partly on time taken to complete stages, provides a great reason to avoid having the computer solve every puzzle for you. If you do anything that you know is amazing, you can even save the replay to show others, though you can't share it through Xbox Live. The smart puzzle and tool design allow for some innovative solutions that are sure to give you a sense of accomplishment for thinking outside of the box.   With the good comes the bad. Eets: Chowdown is just a simple puzzle game. Although there are 123 stages built across six themed lands, there really isn't a lot to differentiate one stage from the next when you look at the big picture. This tends to make the experience drag when everything blends together. Even later in the game, when the puzzles are more difficult and require more user action, it still doesn't take away from this feeling.   Perhaps the biggest reason the game drags is that it is not very involved. Thinking and planning rule the roost here, which is usually a good thing in puzzle games. However, once you've laid out your solution, you only need to push a few buttons to activate tools once Eets is walking along. The game winds up being a bit passive, even for a puzzler. More involved puzzles come later in the game, but the game doesn't move beyond timed presses of a couple of buttons in sequence.   Eets has previously made an appearance on the PC with the full download priced the same as the Xbox 360 version. The rules of the game are the same, though the levels and layout are a bit different. The one big omission in the Xbox 360 iteration that was present on the PC is a level editor. On your home computer, you can create and share your own puzzles and even download other user created levels from the official website. All of this would have been cool on Xbox Live, but it didn't make the transition. It's a shame that more community features like this haven't shown up on Xbox Live. A puzzle game like this would have been a good small scale testing ground.   Everyone loves multipliers, especially in Marsho Madness As a replacement of sorts for the missing editor, a new multiplayer mode has been created called Marsho Madness. This game is only playable offline with anywhere from 1-4 players taking part in the action. The point of the game is to push the correct sequence of buttons to zap enemies as they swarm towards your home base at the center of the screen. As the game progresses, more complicated enemies appear and in greater number to create a constantly building sense of tension. This game works as a side distraction, though it should have been made playable through Xbox Live.    Despite the simple game design and 2D visuals, Eets: Chowdown has an attractive look to it thanks to some nice and imaginative style. Think Alien Homind HD here, though not quite as flashy or quirky. There's nothing mind blowing though, and the fact that each puzzle is made from cookie cutter pieces does tend to make the whole experience blur together with few memorable moments.    The music in Eets is just as low budget as the visuals, but it doesn't work nearly as well. What toes the passable line in a PC flash game just comes off as lazy on the Xbox Live Arcade. That's not to say the sound work is terrible, but the elevator music is pretty generic and the sound effects are sparse and uninspired.   Even with the few places Eets could have been made better, the game is still a solid choice for anyone looking to get the brain juices flowing. Eets: Chowdown isn't as active and immediately engaging as many of the other Xbox Live Arcade titles, but it succeeds in delivering an entertaining puzzle game that is well worth a look.", "date": "Apr 27, 2007"}
