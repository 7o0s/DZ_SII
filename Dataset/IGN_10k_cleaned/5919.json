From the onset the game was extremely ambitious. It was to be the first installment in a three part sci-fi epic with story elements contributed by famed science fiction author Orson Scott Card. The gameplay would blend third-person shooting mechanics with god-like super powers.However, when the game was playable At E3 in 2004 it suffered from a horrendous framerate and iffy controls. It looked as though GlyphX had overshot its capabilities and Advent Rising would slide into the dark valley of games brimming with potential, but lacking follow-through. When released on Xbox Advent mixed elements one expects from a big-budget project with lingering technical shortcomings that fans hoped would be addressed with the PC release. After another brief delay the game has arrived for second time and while it solves some of the problems from the Xbox version, it also has its own PC specific shortcomings. In a Galaxy Far Far Away...Nowadays, it's not enough for a game to implement tight mechanics and flashy visuals, it must also contain a compelling storyline with an arc that leaves players with a satisfied sense of accomplishment. Just look at the backlash to the Halo 2 cliff-hanger. With Orson Scott Card attached to the project, (he co-wrote the dialog) it was a comfortable assumption early on that Advent Rising would contain a compelling narrative. In this category, the game does not disappoint. Set in the distant future, humans are capable of interplanetary travel and have colonized new worlds. The game begins when first contact is made with not one, but two alien races. The first visitors are a benevolent group of fish-people that refer to humans as the ~exulted ones.~ It turns out that the human race is the basis of a far-reaching galactic religion that believes the mythic creatures will usher in a new age of galactic harmony. On the flip side of that coin, another race called the Seekers are in the process of roaming space looking for humans and exterminating them. They are also converging on Gideon's planet. The arrival of the Seekers sets off a series of catastrophic events that puts the main character at constant risk of joining the rest of the humans in their untimely death. There are plot twists, back stabbings, and a smattering of political intrigue that make Advent Rising feel like it was adapted from a classic science fiction novel. In fact, this is the first time I've really wanted a game to be transformed into a feature length film. Heck, the plot is ten times better than Chronicles of Riddick although I'm sure people who think atmosphere is generated by using the ~F~ word will disagree.   There is a well-rounded story arc that transcends a basic ~kill the bad dudes~ mentality. Yes, the game is the first part of a series, but it feels like a complete episode and closes out the plot points raised in the beginning of the story. The main character, Gideon, isn't your typical gun-toting lug. He's a rookie pilot with strong ties to his war-hero brother and a beautiful  fianc. The systematic extermination of the human race rips away everything dear to Giddeon and provides plenty of motivation to take the battle back to the Seekers. Gideon PayneGideon has an impressive range of combat techniques including dual wielding 11 different guns, a melee attack, grenades, and an eventual arsenal of six different super powers. On top of this, he has the ability to perform a slow motion dodge jump with Max Payne mechanics. The dodge not only avoids damage, it focuses the targeting reticule to an enemy's weak point increasing the power of Gideon's assault. The right and left mouse buttons are mapped to each hand and the dodge can be activated by holding down a shift (by default) or double tapping a directional key. The slo-mo dodge isn't unlocked immediately, but is earned just like every other ability. A major aspect discussed in the Xbox version of Advent Rising was an aiming system called Flick Targettting. Essentially this allowed players to quickly lock onto targets, leaving buttons open on the control pad to handle dual wielding, dodging, and super powers. A mouse and keyboard accommodate all of these actions and the flick targeting system has been almost completely done away with. The only artifact left from the feature is that the mouse wheel moves a targeting reticule over enemies on the right or left when rolled either up or down. This feature comes in handy once in awhile, but often feels like a failed attempt to incorporate a gameplay mechanic that is unnecessary on PC. Also, for a power like ~Lift~ it is necessary to lock onto a target and the mouse wheel just doesn't feel like the best way to accomplish this. Players may find themselves fiddling with the control setup for awhile before finding something more intuitive.     The game also still plays by a few console rules that just don't translate well to the PC. For example, the plasma weapons and rockets have slow moving projectiles and Gideon's actions often feel floaty.  If you're willing to deal with a slower pace of combat this isn't such a large problem, but twitch gamers are almost guaranteed to become frustrated. A Smoother RideGamers who were originally interested in the Xbox release of Advent Rising will immediately want to know if the frame rate issues persist on the PC. Thankfully, the game now runs smoothly without slowdown even on a densely populated battlefield. My Radeon 9800 pro easily pushed the game along at even the higher settings. Effects like the way space is warped around Gideon's surge attack and the fiery sparks of explosions are impressive visual additions. However, due to the increased capability and higher expectations on the PC, this doesn't automatically bump up our rating of the graphics. The visuals are decent but never stunning and in some areas feel dated. Also, the game possesses texture work that is bland on a television and even duller on the higher resolution of a monitor.   Advent possesses a strange character design that will not sit well with some people. The human figure has been elongated to produce a strange take on anime. Unfortunately this stylistic decision doesn't extend itself past a character's height, and human faces are left looking flat and bland. The aliens stand in sharp contrast to the humans, with extremely detailed anatomy that stand on their own without borrowing too heavily from other games or movies. The game is packed with cut scenes that have a somewhat under-stylized cartoon approach that is less effective than attempted realism and too understated to compete with anime. However, they are well directed and only display a few awkward moments that ruin the immersion. There are a few areas in Advent Rising where scripted events refused to play out and I was forced to restart the level. There were also some sporadic problems with AI patterns and characters becoming stuck behind or inside of objects. These technical issues were by no means common occurrences, but should be noted for gamers who like to wander off of the set path. Epic SoundAdvent Rising has not one, but two Emmy Award winners contributing to its soundtrack. The score was performed by a 70-piece orchestra and an operative choir with a lengthy post-production process. Not only is the music moving but it includes the dramatic ~punch~ found in most Hollywood productions. This isn't just music that complements the gameplay, it's a soundtrack that will send you searching for the mp3s.    The sound effects and voice acting are held to the same high standards. Rocket explosions and weapon discharges are accentuated with punchy blasts and rumbling bass. If you have a 5.1 setup, this is an excellent game to crank. The human and alien characters are well acted and thankfully they lack the emotionless drone that pervades the voices in so many games with dramatic dialogue. Maybe my brain is still scarred from the near demented dialogue in Star Wars: Episode III, but the script for Advent Rising puts that movie to shame. The next movie-to-game translation should look to Advent Rising for its audio cues.I said it before and I'll say it again, Advent Rising is a perfect example of a game that falls into our 7 range. It has some first-rate elements along with some glaring flaws, but looking at the score alone does not do this title justice. It has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay, story, and sound. The PC is a tough arena for a shooter and in no way does this game compete against the heavy hitters. Instead, it brings original ideas and a good dose of personality to a genre that often focuses too much on just shooting people in the face. If you are able to ignore some technical shortcomings and enjoy cut-scenes and character development, this title is worth a look. Also, fans of the game who have been looking to the PC to clear up the problems with the Xbox version will find that the PC version is a much smoother ride. I very much wanted this game to reach the eights and it is a slight improvement from the console iteration. Hopefully, Advent Rising is the first installment of a series that will improve upon some very good ideas.", "date": "Aug 9, 2005"}
