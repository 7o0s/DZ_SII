There's the sci-fi sector that has been used and abused over the last couple of years, the fantasy genre, which hasn't been quite as abused as sci-fi, and historical, which hasn't really been abused. The thing with that sector is that almost all of the historical RTSs that have made it to shelves have been based on western history. So I'm pretty happy when I get to play an RTS that not only is historical, but is also set in a culture different than my own. With a smile on my face, I loaded up Fate of the Dragon, based on the Three Kingdoms period of 2nd century China. So where'd my smile go? Well, I guess it's not totally gone or anything... it's just not as big. I want the big one back. Oh well. Unfortunately Fate of the Dragon found itself on my computer with some really great ideas and features but sadly  fell short in a few areas that really could have made it shine.  For those that don't know the history of the game, you need to read the previews cause I'm not going over it again for your lazy asses. Because my lazy ass is lazier. But in short, it takes place in a very complicated and messy period of history in China when the land was split into Three Kingdoms while everyone was trying to grab the throne.  So I jump into the game. It worked well minus a couple of bugs that have been fixed in a patch already. I then immediately jumped into the single player campaigns hoping for the best because I had some good expectations. There are some really nice features in the game that make this something that big RTS fans may want to check out.  The campaign missions in the game are divided into the three different heroes and their role in history. For the most part, they are just about taking this city and that city or wiping out everyone on the map that isn't you. That's not all bad, but it can get repetitive. But there are enough cool things to keep you interested for a while.  One feature in particular made me really happy. I've always looked for something like this in an RTS and I really hope that more developers take note and start thinking about doing the same thing. This great feature I'm talking about is the separation of city and overland maps. It's done very smoothly for easy transitions and works really well for a first attempt. The interface has two map windows on the bottom of the screen. The right is dedicated to the overland map where you can find county towns (more on that in a sec) and the entrances to other cities as well as mines and forests.  Moving from city to city (you can own more than one) is easy as pie with the interface. All you need to do is click on the city icon next to the city map on the bottom left of the interface and your view will transfer there. That along with the pause feature allows for easy management of cities. Inside the city maps you'll find a wall with a gate surrounding the working parts of the city for defense. The gate can be locked and the walls can be manned for defense of the city. This creates what could be some really great situations for sieges in order to capture a city.  Unfortunately, it also creates the problem of making it necessary to build a huge force to go out and crush your opponent. So basically the game sinks back into the old massing of armies tactics that we've all gotten a bit sick of. It's a bit more interesting in mulitplayer, but even that will degenerate down to attrition if you're playing a game where you have to capture a city. My biggest gripe with this system is that there is no form of organized fighting. NO FORMATIONS. Ach. When you're dealing with the number of troops that are necessary for taking over a city, some kind of organization would have been appreciated. Instead, all of your units just run ahead in a blob trying to get to the target.  On the other hand, sieges often did degrade to just rushing the walls in a mad frenzy to gain some sort of foothold. But then there are also siege engines that will help you get over the walls. There are ladders for your troops to run up, catapults to take out archers in big groups on the walls and other contraptions to get your units to the other side. But once they get on the walls, get over the walls, or get through the gate, the scene quickly desolves into a pretty chaotic mess. Troops will run all over the place, orders will be hard to give, so you'll pretty much have to cross your fingers and hope for the best.  And things can go bad very quickly if you haven't kept your troops' strength up. This is another neat feature in the game that was a really good idea, but ends up not being as cool as it could have been. Troops have to have food, which is no problem if they are in a city where the food is being produced, but they also need food when they are out fighting in the overland map and in different cities. If they aren't supplied with that via camps and supply trains, their strength will disappear, they won't attack as fast, and will generally be food for the wood chipper against rested and fed troops. I really do like the idea, but its just really hard to manage all of your cities direct troops to different areas of the map, research new technologies, take care of disasters, train troops, and then keep your troops fed in camps all at the same time. It just gets to be a bit much, especially when you are in multiplayer and you can't pause.  The other pretty cool idea that was introduced was the idea of county towns. They are little cash cows sitting around the overland map that can be captured to add to your tax flow. It's actually pretty fun trying to steal these counties from your enemies and keep them, but for some reason, you can't garrison them. That presents a problem when you are trying to keep them. In order to protect them, you'll need to build a camp out next to it and garrison some troops in there as well as set up a supply line there as well which just makes it totally not worth the effort. But chances are, your opponent won't find it in his or her best interest to protect the towns full time either so they'll just end up trading hands a whole lot because you'll need the extra income for upgrades and training.  Gold isn't the only resource you'll need to worry about in the game though. You'll also need to build farms to make grain and pork, mine metal, cut wood, and make food and wine. All of this makes a pretty complicated economic model that is actually kind of fun to set up and get running. You'll need to do that in every city that own though because resources are not shared across your cities. If one of them needs some more supplies, you need to assign a worker to grab some horses and lug some goods over that way.  One point of contention I have with the game is the lack of AI in the game. There doesn't seem to be any real kind of thought to the computer's attacks. It mainly consists of increasingly large numbers of units thrown against your walls without much thought. Only once did I ever see a computer opponent try and sneak through a gap in my defenses via a scaling ladder. They almost always just threw themselves headlong at the gate and tried to knock it down even on hard.  My other major problem was with the way they decided to handle the fog of war. It doesn't ruin the game or anything, but it's really annoying. Instead of the transparent fog of war that encroaches after you've explored an area of the map, the black opaque fog of war moved back in to block everything that you've seen after a while. So unless you have a really good memory, or turn off the fog of war (which I don't like to do), you won't be able to remember the layout of the terrain to know where to send your troops. Not that they'd be able to make it there in a timely fashion anyway as the pathfinding isn't top shape.   Other than that, there's a decent game underneath. There isn't a lot of variety in the units (just slight adjustments depending on your warlord), the graphics aren't the best you'll ever see, and the sound is hit and miss, but if you are looking to try something with some cool new features, this may be for you.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
