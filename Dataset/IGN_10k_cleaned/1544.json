This year, other polygonal hockey games have been making their presence known, which may melt this year's version of the ground-breaking game. NHL Powerplay '98 features all the in-rink options you would expect from a hockey game. Updated stats and rosters, official NHL logos, awesome looking stadiums - the list goes on and on. Trust us, you can do just about everything.  Graphics are also one of the many strong points here. On-rink polygonal characters move exceptionally well and possess some realistic animations, including high-sticking swings and great checking shots. However, the players move just a little too slowly for our taste.  If you look pass the great graphics and options, you'll notice that the game has a few flaws in the gameplay. The game moves noticeably slow when compared to other hockey games. And even though sprite-based games are slowly going out of style, they still play faster than most polygonal sports games.  The link between polygons and gameplay has yet to be made, but NHL Powerplay '98 makes a nice attempt. If you really want a hockey game for your PlayStation, this one is probably your best bet for now.  PSX Staff", "date": "Aug 29, 1997"}
