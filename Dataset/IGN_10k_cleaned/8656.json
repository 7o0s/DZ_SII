First released in 1992, this TurboGrafx title initially coincided with the playing of the Games in Barcelona that summer, and its selection of events is drawn from that source  meaning what you're getting here is a whole array of fair-weather, sports-themed mini-games that play out quickly in rapid-fire, button-mashing bursts. If you were a fan of other fast-on-the-trigger sports titles like Konami's Track & Field or Epyx's Summer Games in years long past, you may want to give this overlooked Competition a glance.        There's no official Olympic license in World Sports Competition, so the ~World~ part is more left to you and your friends' imaginations. You, and your friends, because WSC has a definite multiplayer focus  up to five players can play at once, competing in any of 18 different events. Differentiating your competitor from your friends' men is achieved through simply alternating skin tone and uniform color, which is unfortunate  even with no actual Olympic rings logo on the package, Hudson still could have used the different national flags of the globe.   The 18 events come in six different categories  track, field, swimming, rowing, shooting and archery  and they're a mixed bag of varied designs. All of them are playable with up to five human competitors, with some playing out as head-to-head simultaneous challenges and others alternating, one player at a time. Some of them are button-mashers, relying on your skill at quick, repetitive, back-and-forth trigger strikes to find success, while others demand more precision and timing. And some of them really seem to be just slightly altered clones of others, copying off the playstyle of the event that came before it  so, overall, a mixed bag.   It's not difficult to guess which games line up with which styles. The running events like the 100-Meter Dash are the pure button-mashers, as you jab 1 and 2, then 1, then 2, back and forth again and again to make your athlete sprint his heart out (using the sideways Wiimote control option). The hit-the-target shooting events pair a targeting cursor with a power gauge, to line up your shot and fire for the bulls-eye. Most of them are remarkably simple, then, though there's a bit of depth in the designs that make you monitor your Olympian's exerted oxygen level at the same time as you're pulling your thumb muscles trying to gain just a bit of extra speed.   And World Sports isn't easy  finding success in many of the events really is something of a strain, as it can be difficult to perform well enough to keep from being disqualified and sent back to the Continue/Give Up selection screen. It's worth your while to spend some time pulling up and reading the virtual instruction manual for this one, as the controls aren't immediately obvious for each event.  With no Olympic license, its left to your own mental visualizations to picture that your runner really is representing the glory of Sri Lanka.  But World Sports Competition is an artifact of a bygone age when sports games could just be sports games, without the need for trademarked logos or celebrity endorsements. Its quick, simple style of play and fair variety of mini-games, along with its support for up to five simultaneous players, combine to make it worth a look for fans of this old genre  but players looking for more depth and more creativity in gameplay control would probably be better off saving the six bucks and putting it toward the upcoming Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games instead.", "date": "Jun 19, 2007"}
