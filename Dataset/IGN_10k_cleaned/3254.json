No 3D platformer, from Mario 64 to Klonoa has been able to offer the precise control or field of view that a 2D Mega Man or even Sonic the Hedgehog can offer. All the more surprising, then that Pitfall is almost as fun to play in three dimensions as it was in two.  The original Pitfall was one of the founding fathers of the platforming genre, introducing such concepts as continue points, vine-swinging, pit-jumping, and multi-screen levels on the venerable Atari 2600. Pitfall 3D designers took that formula and successfully transplanted it into the 32-bit era.  You're going to be taking Pitfall Harry (as voiced competently by Army of Darkness star Bruce Campbell) across levels built using the classic Pitfall formula, with signature items like the swinging vines, evil scorpions, gold bars, and lots and lots of jumping action. They're placed well in new surroundings, but some conventions, like the chest-beating Tarzan swinging action are still pretty fresh among the new platformers.  Even though the levels are clearly polygonal, Activision has tried purposefully to keep the action as two-dimensional as possible, either as homage to the original, or simply to make it easier to play. Most of the time, players will only travel horizontall or vertically. This may seem strange when slogging through uncharted jungles or lost cities, but believe me, it's better to jump onto a vine going just left and right rather than one swing in an awkward diagonal manner. While it may not have the freedom Croc or Gex had, the gameplay and the puzzles are cleverly designed around the character's limitations, although it does employ some of the hoarier devices like the floating platforms to make things more interesting.  Still and all, Pitfall falls victim to the problems nobody's really managed to solve in a 3D platformer. The camera, in order to keep the action as 2D as possible, will shift angles automatically, depending on the set of obstacles to be run. Occasionally, it will change at precicisely the wrong moment, making players twitch mid-jump as the camera turns the moving platform 90 degress. Overall, it works competently, but it's too close in, and you're going to find platforms and traps floating abruptly in and out of the screen. You're limited to solving only one small piece of the puzzle at a time.  Control is responsive, although jumping action is sluggish. This is forgiveable because the levels are generally wider spaced than some other platformers, giving players more room to react. There's a tendency to die too easy by falling off an edge, but death is rarely very dodgy, and you'll be able to see where you went wrong. Pitfall 3D is a well-designed game, and a good update to the first Pitfall (which is also included in the game as a bonus). There are still a couple issues that we wish Activision had worked on, but it takes a different direction from other 3D platforms and one that bears further investigation. If you're a fan of the original, or even if you're not, it's worth checking out.", "date": "Mar 28, 1998"}
