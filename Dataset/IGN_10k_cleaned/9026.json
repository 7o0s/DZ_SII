Over three separate releases covering three different theaters of World War II, the series managed to offer some of the most accurate and intense tactical experiences we've ever seen. So when it was announced that the team would be creating an entirely new engine and focusing on a more modern war for Combat Mission: Shock Force, we were definitely excited.  Unfortunately, while Shock Force manages to capture the high level of realism found in previous games in the series, the poor interface design and lack of a flexible or responsive AI makes it difficult to appreciate the things that the game gets right. Moreover, the graphics, though capable of displaying great until detail in extreme close-ups, don't scale very well and don't run very well at any setting.   The game represents a hypothetical, future conflict between the US and Syria, which bears some unsettling but nevertheless intriguing similarities to current US engagements in the real world. The relevance of the game to our own world has certainly deepened over the past few years of development, but the campaign and mission design wisely focuses on the action without adding on layers of political or moral context. We might have liked a bit more of a narrative here, at least as far as the military progress of the war as a whole, but the individual missions are compelling enough to stand by themselves.  Each mission presents an intriguing tactical challenge, mostly concerned with securing objectives and eliminating a certain fraction of the enemy force. More interesting objectives will ask you to discover intelligence or destroy enemy buildings. Success here is measured in degrees and it's very refreshing that the game lets you continue on to the next mission even when you fail. Most missions however are structured to take quite a bit longer than necessary so there's plenty of downtime.  As with the other Combat Mission games, there are plenty of individual missions you can play outside of the campaign. Scripted missions, a mission generator and a full editor give you more than enough options to extend your enjoyment of the game beyond the campaign. It would have been nice to see a little more variety in terms of the random maps' geography but what really disappoints is the inability to create your own forces for these random battles. You can select general unit types to include, but it would still be preferable to assemble your army by hand.   Each of the units in the game seems to have been modeled in exacting detail, taking note of things like the armor slope and thickness of the vehicles in the game as well as the ammo levels of each and every infantry weapon. Improving over the pattern established by previous Combat Mission games, Shock Force actually renders each individual member of a fire team, so you'll be able to see specifically where each of your soldiers are on the battlefield.      The US makes use of Strykers and Abrams tanks and a range of infantry units. They'll also often have the option to call in off map support in the form of artillery or air strikes. We particularly like the option to set a linear target for this fire; it comes in very handy when trying to bust up trenches. The demands of accuracy mean that the Syrian forces are quite a bit less powerful than the US troops but they do have some interesting units -- technicals, IEDs, RPGs -- that can give them a slight edge.  Shock Force offers up the standard turn-based modes of the previous games, but also introduces a full real-time mode as well. It's exciting to play Combat Mission in real time but it doesn't include the standard RTS conventions, like creating hot groups, creating formations, or drag selecting mixed groups of units. As a result, you'll have to micromanage things a bit too much. On the plus side, you can issue orders in paused mode to get things the way you want them.   Shock Force does away with the convenient right-click menu of previous games in the series and instead relies on a wide range of hotkeys. It's easy enough once you get used to the shortcuts, but being able to draw up an order menu right on the game map would have been much more convenient. Likewise, there are no tooltips at all in the game, which means you'll be referring back to the manual to discover just where all your commands are.  The real killer here with regard to the missions is that the red force AI isn't very active. The missions are designed to hide this by forcing the player to assault fixed positions, but even so, you'll eventually discover that the AI just isn't inclined to move to retake objectives or flank advancing forces. We've blasted through roadblocks and never been pursued; we've left small forces at objectives that were never assaulted by nearby enemies; we've called in artillery strikes on enemies that never even tried to find cover.  This deficiency can be hidden a bit when the player is assaulting fixed defenders but it's really apparent during meeting engagements. Most of the time, the player will be free to march right up to the objective, take it, and then shoot any enemies that he can see from there. An after-action review of the map will reveal enemy infantry and vehicles just sitting idle.   On the friendly side, the AI does a bit better but still benefits from some handholding, particularly with regard to responding to enemy threats while on the move. In most cases, your own units will ignore enemy fire while moving to their objective. It's true that your forces will often fire back and discovered enemies, but they just don't do enough to seek cover when surprised by enemy fire. This lack of self-preservation is especially troubling when you're not paying attention to the units when they come under attack. Vehicle pathfinding presents a number of problems as well when trying to navigate groups of vehicles through narrow city streets.       The levels are very well designed with plenty of tactically significant locations. Crossroads, fortified barracks, narrow defiles and such all make for some interesting playgrounds. On the downside, the game seems married to a very monotonous desert theme and an endless succession of bland, boxy buildings. Perhaps the worst aspect of the maps is that they just give out at the edges and float over a huge sandy texture. We much prefer the way that the battle areas in Theatre of War blended in with more realistic horizons.  Animations and unit detail are really fantastic up close. Infantry outfits and vehicle detailing are very high, so you can definitely get lost in the action when viewing things from ground level. The animations of soldiers running or tanks rocking back and forth after firing their guns definitely adds to the realism here. The interface doesn't really work at this scale, however, so you'll have to bounce back and forth between this and the more traditional high-level view. As you move out, the graphics get scaled way back; textures get blocky and animations for some of the units disappear altogether.   Line of sight and line of fire seems to matter a great deal in the game but it doesn't always match the geometry of the level. So while you might not be able to trace an unobstructed line directly from one unit to another, that doesn't mean that they can't see and fire on each other. Given the scale of the game, it's not a surprise that there's some abstraction going on here, but it can be very disappointing to get your units behind cover only to discover that they can still be shot at by nearby enemies.  The high system requirements for Shock Force are out of line with the quality of the graphics and the game's overall performance. There's apparently an issue with nVidia cards that cause significant stuttering, which can make issuing commands and moving the camera more difficult than it should be, requiring you to pause the game just to get your orders right.Battlefront can be commended for their speedy patches but that doesn't excuse the sorry state of the game when it was released or make it any easier to endure the problems that still exist, particularly with regard to the apathetic AI, gummy interface, or poor overall performance. There are undoubtedly a small number of CM fans out there who can look past these issues in anticipation of future fixes but for the rest of us life is just too short to allow for these sorts of compromises.The title still scores high in terms of the interesting setting and the accuracy of the unit and combat modeling. Players who are looking for a realistic simulation of a war that's not unlike what our own troops are undergoing right now can definitely find it in Shock Force. Unfortunately, the Syrians aren't nearly as daunting an enemy as the deficiencies in the game's overall design.", "date": "Sep 12, 2007"}
