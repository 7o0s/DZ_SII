But that didn't stop THQ from trying again -- instead of handing the sequel over to the original GBC design team, the company went with Japanese developer Natsume. And instead of a traditional platformer, the design team created an overhead action/adventure title -- this time, the game works rather well. Features 12 levels Unlimited continues Password save Only for Game Boy Color   While playing on the beach one day, Croc stumbles upon a bottle with a note -- from his mother. What are the odds? Seems the reptile's parents are looking for the little guy, so Croc begins his journey to find his long lost family. Unfortunately, Baron Dante's going to make Croc's life a living hell by throwing obstacles in his way -- so you'll have to traverse the foreign land and defeat the bad guys.  The Game Boy Color game more mimics the console editions of Croc than the last version that hit the handheld, and that's a good thing -- the PlayStation and Saturn games were 3D platformers with tons of puzzle elements to keep the title from getting stale. And that's exactly what the Game Boy Color sequel is: an adventure game where you can maneuver in a pseudo-3D in an overhead perspective. Croc can walk, run, and jump in eight directions, and the levels themselves staircase up and down for a decent sense of the third dimension...at least in the gameplay sense.   Similar gameplay elements from the original Croc are employed in the sequel, which means collecting items and tail-whipping enemies are still a heavy focus of the gameplay. But there's much more puzzle solving this time around, and it's this that makes Croc 2 much more enjoyable. In several instances, you'll have to push huge boulders in places so you'll be able to activate switches or reach higher ledges. In one clever level, you have to race a globule of water flowing through a pipe network, hitting switches to alter its course in order to access the treasure hidden inside the pipe. These puzzles are few and far between, but when you find them they really bring out the charm of this fun little sequel.  The game isn't terribly huge or complex, though some of the levels can get a bit confusing simply because they're broken into several sections -- you'll have to memorize where the level goes, because sometimes the terrain goes so high that you won't be able to access portions from the most convenient locations. The game design really needs a map that you can pull up within a level so you can see where you are and where you've been.  The graphics are charming, but the perspective isn't drawn as well as it should have -- Croc looks downright stupid when he's looking up and down the screen, having a beak larger than Jamie Farr's. It's also difficult to visually tell how high a certain ledge is -- it's mostly trial and error to figure out if a ledge is low enough to jump on.   As a sequel, Croc 2 blows away the original effort produced by the development company responsible for giving the little guy life. Handing the game over to Natsume was a great move by THQ as the development team produced a title that's not exactly clich or formula -- at least on the Game Boy Color. Natsume produced a decent adventure for the cute reptile, so don't let his first outing on the handheld taint your purchase decision -- this game is a good one.", "date": "Feb 3, 2001"}
