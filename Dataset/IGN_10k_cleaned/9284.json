Yes, it's a budget title, and yes it apparently took publisher XS Games or Italian developer Milestone (the same folks behind the Superbike and Screamer series) all of about six seconds to actually come up with the title, but for what it is, SPU isn't exactly a horrible game. It's not a great game either, it's just... well, it's just there.   Supposedly Super Truck racing is all the rage overseas, and if nothing else, Milestone has culled some of their considerable talent at making a solid racer into something that has the trappings of a sim-like experience, yet eventually shifts into a turbo-heavy, powerslide-rich arcade racer, and that's fine by me.    The whole progression system uses cash earned from doing things like drafting, leading laps, finishing in first, overtaking cars, conserving turbo, and so on, in order to unlock upgrades to the car's brakes, engine, endurance and other attributes. This dynamic is meant to give you the feeling of going somewhere, but with the exception of some of the speedier cars and more technical tracks, what you've seen after the first 15 minutes or so holds true throughout the game.    Things start off promising enough, where you select a team from a basic list that offers specific point multipliers for everything from racing clean to overtaking cars to placing first. It's a novel enough concept, but given that the unlockables in the game tend to flow in pretty regularly, going with one team over another is really just a matter of picking someone to match your particular play style, which by the end of the game will likely just mean mashing the turbo and powersliding around hairpins.    If not for the fact that there are a handful of challenges that test your ability to use the brake sparingly (you have a set number of seconds of total brake time before it's game over), haul ass through a course in a time trial, stick to a racing line, use turbo and so on, the game would be wafer thin on actual variety. As it stands, nearly every challenge boils down to just mashing the turbo and steering, but at least the challenges give you something different from the career races.    The three-track divisions force you to pick between front-, rear- and four-wheel drive trucks in street and circuit varieties, but for the first few hours, you'll be racing around the same three or four tracks ad nauseum. Sure, there are a whopping two variations to each course, but it's not enough to make them feel different and keep it interesting for longer than perhaps your first run through the career mode races (once you complete the four different classes, you can graduate to a new set and pick a different team with new bonuses).    What's truly frustrating is that the core game is decent enough to have had something major heaped upon it; the controls are tight while still remaining arcadey and easy to understand (in fact, it may have just been me, but I swear I noticed little things like the tires heating up after a lap or so and becoming more sticky), and had the challenges been a little more varied, they would have been more than just a distraction. Then again, having to sit through a good 20+ seconds of loading for each race/challenge adds up to a whole lot of staring at loading screens, so maybe it's for the best.   It doesn't help that the game looks and sounds like a budget title too -- all that loading apparently isn't going toward the visuals, as the game is modestly textured (you can even see the skybox seam at times), uses the barest of special effects in the form of a little motion blur during turbo boosts, but at least the game sports a solid framerate. The truck models are only superficially different and with the exception of sagging bumpers and some cracked glass textures, don't really respond to damage realistically. The music, a mish-mash of generic sounding, slightly-twangy guitars, might work with the NASCAR crowd, but it was little more than filler for my ears.It all adds up to a game that just intrinsically feels like a budget title, like something that's literally meant to fill shelf space in the hopes that some clueless grandma, come Christmas time, will see trucks on the cover and pick up a sweet deal for little Jimmy. In that regard, it's not exactly a rip-off, but for those looking for anything more than a shallow racer with solid controls, it's best to just keep looking.", "date": "Oct 20, 2007"}
