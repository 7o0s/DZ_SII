Last year's version was a surprisingly good action title considering the rather unfavorable critical response the series has received on other systems. 3DO obviously didn't want to break was wasn't already broken, and for the sequel we get more of the same, but in a new environment: the real world. Features Two campaigns, 40+ missions Password save Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color   Last year's edition put the Green army against the Tan army in a fantasy war-torn world. In this edition, these guys are now where you'd expect to see plastic soldiers -- tiny and lost somewhere under your feet. Flowerbeds, kitchen tables, and workbenches are the Army Men world of battle, and these guys take it all in stride.  You're literally a one-man army, or rather, the Green Army's whipping boy. Command HQ is constantly telling you to clean out the tan army from a given location so they can move in on the territory, but you'll get absolutely no backup in assistance. Luckily, you can pick up weapons like a flamethrower, mortar and grenades to even the odds, as well as hop into a jeep or tank to run down a few lazy tan guys.  If you've played the first one, not much has changed this time around. General tweaks in the code here and there, and overall improvements in the game's speed (last year's version puttered along at a pace that just begged to be upped). The interface is identical, which is both good and bad -- side-stepping is still a chore since you have to move the D-pad while holding down the B button, a key that's also used for switching weapons and dropping down on your belly. Vehicle missions are thankfully more plentiful and show up earlier in this edition -- tanks and jeeps were in last year's model but these missions were extremely rare. And most every object in the game can be blown up...now that's cool.   The main issue many gamers had with Army Men was its wonky controls, and while they're here in the second one, it's really not as bad as one might think since you need as much directional control and aim as possible. Instead of the up, down, left and right controls to maneuver in the battlefield, you're offered more of a control scheme that's similar to a first-person shooter. But since you're looking down at a scrolling playfield the controls are a little less intuitive than you might expect. The traditional controls are offered in a secondary scheme, but there's a reason why Digital Eclipse picked the first control scheme as the default -- learn it and use it.  New to the series is the addition of link-cable support -- hooray! Two options are here, a deathmatch and a capture the flag challenge. Both games are rudimentary, and don't really have an addictive quality since you're only up against the other person (no drones). I would have liked to have seen some cooperative missions for players to compete. But it's always great to see the extra time put into a game for multiplayer action -- and it adds just a bit more playability to an already good game.  But all Army Men 2 really adds is new missions in a new environment with last year's gameplay -- the design was a great surprise a year ago, but now it's the same ol' thing. It's still a great game, but we're just not fans of quick rehashes and shouldn't encourage this habit.   Even though the series is pretty crap on other systems, Army Men has turned out good not just once, but twice on the Game Boy Color. The addition of the link cable is definitely welcome, but it could've used a bit more in the design. We're just knocking a point off from last year's score because it's just not that big of a leap or that huge of a design change to justify a must-have purchase.", "date": "Nov 9, 2000"}
