The license is rich in background and fan base. The genre is one of the most popular around. The game is boring and badly executed. What could have been a winner in all kinds of respects just turned out to be yet another RTS. And the even sadder part is that Star Trek: New Worlds turned out to be just another RTS that has a whole lot of problems and is missing a whole lot of components that we've come to expect in real time strategy games.  Let's first get into the story a bit, which for the record is actually pretty decent. You get thrown right into the middle of a story that takes place right after that awful Star Trek V: The Final Frontier movie (oddly fitting) in the year 2292 and quickly find yourself at home in the diplomatic flavor of this particular period of Star Trek history. The Romulans are doing what they do best and are breaking the rules again in the neutral zone. They trigger a new weapon in space that not only destroys a Klingon ship but also triggers a reaction that brings a dense system of stars out of nowhere into our space. After all is said and done, the planets in the anomaly star system known as the Tabula Rasa are found to have incredible riches and all of the superpowers are suddenly rushing to claim them as their own. The Romulans, Klingons, and Federation all stake a little claim and begin a little struggle to capture enough wealth to gain an advantage over each other. Caught in the middle of all of this is a race known as the Taubat whom worship dilithium and power conversion. The Federation takes steps to secure them as allies through peace and negotiation, the Romulans try to win them through negotiation and trickery, and the Klingons just kick them in the teeth.   This all sets up the impending ground battles that take place on the various worlds of the Tabula Rasa. Why ground battles? Why not just raze the occupants out of the planet? Well that actually does happen in specific parts of the game out of your control, but according to the story and documentation, there just aren't enough star ships in each of the empires to really make doing that often a feasible option. So it's left to those sad little pandas that wear the red shirts in the shows to take the brunt of the growing conflict. And I, for one, thought that this was a pretty cool idea. I always wanted to see some of those ground battles and assaults that you hear about in the shows. Well unfortunately, the idea is about where it stops being fun or cool. The game is just boring. I'll admit it, I'm a geek, I like Star Trek, but the game bored me. The only thing that kept me going was my interest in hearing the rest of the story. But not only was it boring, it was also put together with the grace of a thousand drunken Tribbles.  The gameplay itself and missions do hold various tasks, but unfortunately much of the time you will be forced to hunt everything not of your own species to extinction which is perhaps one of the most annoying objectives in any RTS game, especially when the units are on the move all of the time. The use of the scout vehicles in the game makes this a little quicker, but there is also a problem with that which will be explained in a second. Other than that, mission objectives involve building your base up to a certain point which pretty much is how every game has to start if you have any hope of surviving. Once that is done, you may have to scan a building using a science vehicle or mine a certain amount of dilithium or capture a building. Whatever the mission, and whatever other objectives are given, they almost always seem to involve building up a force that can wipe out everything on the map.  Each of the races have fourteen different missions that will involve these kinds of objectives and more. Unfortunately, there aren't many noticeable differences in the races. Sure they have different art but they have almost identical buildings and units. The differences come down to strength, rate, and speed of fire. The Klingons are the best in this department with disruptors that fire fast bolts of energy. The Federation's phasers move a little slower so that units can evade the shots if they are moving at all, and the Romulans fire even slower but are balanced with excellent sensors. The artillery for each side is pretty much the same as well. There are a couple of unique units per race such as the mobile shield generator for the Federation, but for the most part, there just isn't enough difference here to keep interest for long periods of time. Boring... Maybe I've been spoiled by games like Starcraft, but I expect a lot from a game in an overcrowded RTS market nowadays in order to recommend it for purchase.   After playing real time strategy games dating all of the way back to the almighty Dune 2, there are some things that I've come to expect over the years to make my game enjoyable, or at the very least, passable. However, Interplay and 14 Degrees East seem to have missed almost every single one of those little features that make RTS games manageable. The first and most important of all of these features in the in game save. Why, oh why, does anyone think this is a good idea? You can't leave the game to do other things if you have to. You can't go back just a little bit in the game if a bug occurs to keep you from winning after an hour and a half of playing. But what you can do is rip the game out of your computer and shove it into the garbage disposal when you spend a Saturday playing the game only to have that very thing happen twice. So after four hours, you've gotten nowhere. Fun? Oh yeah, really fun. So fun in fact, that you may need to take a break and just scream for a little while.   There is also a noticeable lack of battle stances (passive, neutral, aggressive), cancellations when constructing units or buildings, formations, force attack, assignable rally points (the default one is usually behind your base away from the battles), and double clicking to select units. I may have missed some things, but that is what I have written down so there you go. All of those things seem like forgone conclusions in the genre nowadays and would have made the game more enjoyable and easy to manage. Watching your troops all travel in a single file line or let enemies fly by them into your base and not follow them gets a bit frustrating.  If you can get past all of that nonsense, then you'll probably also find yourself at odds with the camera control system. While it is useable, it is very frustrating at times and takes a lot of getting used to. There is a default setting of an isometric view for those players that have trouble with the camera, but it doesn't allow you to zoom out a long ways from the action to monitor your troops better. The free camera mode is what I found myself using most of the time and for the most part it was okay. But there was no double click on the mini map to move the camera somewhere fast, and the double click on a unit actually centers the camera on the unit along the ground so that you have to reset the camera in free mode again and raise the camera up (very slow process by the way) and re-tilt the camera to get it back to being useable. So if you accidentally double click on a unit in battle, you may find yourself out of control of the fight for a few second while you figure out the camera. When changing between the various modes of camera, the angle of the camera will also change so you'll find yourself facing away from the action all of the sudden, which can also cause major problems in a fight. Of course if you are really having trouble with the camera, you could conceivably play the game entirely with the full screen tricorder map, which is actually done fairly well. A bit more detail and information would have been nice, but even without it, the map worked.  Some of the camera problems might have been forgiven if the graphics were incredible, ala Dark Reign 2, but that just isn't the case here. The buildings are blocky and ugly and so are most of the units. The animations make it look as though every vehicle pilot in the future is having trouble taking those twelve steps to recovery. They weeble and they wobble but they don't fall down. There were a couple of little touches that were neat, such as the away teams in the armored personnel carriers running into the building that they want to capture, the little moving parts on the tiny construction bees, and the weapons fire, but for the most part, the graphics are, once again, boring.  The sound was another matter altogether. The music was really quite good and added great Star Trekish atmosphere. The in game sounds could have used a bit more variety as the same sound bites do start to wear on your nerves after a while, but that seems to happen often in these kinds of games. The mission briefings also sounded quite good with some great voice over work. It's really too bad that was all that was good about the briefings. I mentioned it in my first impressions, but I have to again as they are so god-awful. The graphics were terrible when not using the in-game engine (see media below) and were sickening when they were. Somebody decided that making gamers dizzy and maybe even a little sick before a mission would add to the challenge. Well, it worked. I had to shut my eyes and just listen to the briefings so that I wouldn't throw up on my keyboard and cause more problems.  The game does have a multiplayer component so that you can fight amongst yourselves, but only allows up to three players to compete. While I can see the point of keep one person to each race, the point should have been scrapped in the name of fun. When I checked onto Mplayer today to see if any more people had showed up to play the game, I found all of zero people playing the game online if that tells you anything.  What it comes down to is this; if this game didn't have the power of the Star Trek license behind it, nobody would give one whit about it. If you are a die hard Star Trek fan, you may find it interesting enough to wade through all of the problems, but if you aren't, save your money.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
