Reduced to catching black and white war movies on late-night TV, the war is a distant non-memory. In their Medal of Honor series, EA has been bringing history to life with their historically accurate first-person shooters. After doing plenty of damage in Europe, EA brings the series to the Pacific Theater of War with Medal of Honor: Rising Sun.   After Pearl Harbor, the ~sleeping giant~ of America jumps full force into the war effort. General MacArthur fought the Japanese all over the Pacific, fighting from island to island. Bringing this variety of action to the PS2, EA gives us a whizbang tour of the battles that's perfect for a Saturday afternoon.   Gameplay  Just like the previous titles in this series, Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is a first-person shooter with a tightly scripted storyline. It can often feel like it's on a rigid track that never strays off course or even allows you to, but the controlled environments can allow for some interesting events.   Medal of Honor: Rising Sun starts out with a big bang, the invasion of Pearl Harbor. As Joseph Griffin, you are awoken from your slumber in a carrier as torpedoes start hitting the ships in the harbor. What follows is one of the coolest ten minutes of gaming action.    The first priority of the game is just to get to the top deck, getting past the rampant fires and dead bodies in the hallways. Once on top, the true scope of the situation becomes apparent. Planes are dive-bombing the boats and the marines are doing whatever they can to fire back. Jumping on an AA gun lets you sling some metal into the skies until the ship takes one too many hits and you're thrown into the water.     A gunboat picks you up from the ocean and off you go, manning their gun as you cruise around the sinking boats in the harbor. After shooting down some planes and protecting the remaining ships, it's time to lick your wounds and get down to work, entering the new war.   After such a stunning beginning, the business side of Medal of Honor: Rising Sun shows itself as a fairly simple first-person shooter. Missions are often based on moving through a set path of terrain or rooms and killing everyone along the way. With the exception of one open area per level, it's very obvious what the next task is because there's absolutely nowhere else to go. Sometimes there would be an option to go off the main path, but it comes back again very quickly. Succeeding is a matter of moving from place to place and killing as many Japanese as you can. There were only a couple of times that I wandered around a bit to find the next direction.   Missions have a variety of objectives, but they'll never get in the way of finishing the game. In the course of getting through each mission, the path will take you to every object you need to find or destroy so it becomes almost a formality.   Interspersed in several of the levels are gun encampments. After taking out the gunners, I jumped behind the machine gun and always triggered an onslaught of Japanese soldiers. It was meant to enhance the drama of the game, but became almost comedic. I would clear the whole area of any living being, I would've shot the birds if there were any, and then I would jump behind the machine gun and Japanese would still run out to be slaughtered.      So some of the more dramatic elements of the game can be a bit goofy, but others worked much better. Mixing up the action from the regular shooting, a few missions throw you on the back of a truck or even on top of an elephant with the task of clearing out all nearby hostiles as you move by.    Hidden in two of the levels are a machete and a shovel. Unlock these items and a return visit to the levels unlock a few different paths. Hacking through some trees and a new path emerges which gives an excellent vantage point on a machine gun outpost that would have normally given you quite a bit more hassle if you had stumbled on it headfirst as the level usually leads you to.   Instead of opening up the maps and offering more open-ended missions, Medal of Honor: Rising Sun focuses on the storyline. In doing what must have been a tremendous amount of research, EA has created a list of historically accurate missions. No, there was no Joseph Griffin, but all of the assignments take place in real locations, the uniforms are accurate and the guns act just like they did back in the '40s.   The missions follow the events surrounding the Japanese effort to secure gold from its Asian neighbors and use it to help fund the war. Getting that gold back to the island homeland during a war requires several different lines of transport and a refinery and , Medal of Honor: Rising Sun tracks Griffin's task in making sure this doesn't happen.   One mission, set in Singapore, is a stealth game set in the '40s. Instead of a silenced 9mm, the weapon of choice here is a Welrod, a quiet weapon that is slow to reload but packs a deadly wallop. The best part is that it looks like a rusty pipe with a glued on handle. With only one bullet fitting in the chamber, it's essential that the first shot hit its mark.    Aside from the Welrod, there's a large collection of guns to shoot with. A shotgun does some close damage, while machine guns and a sniper rifle fill out the bill. All of them have their own kick and feel and advantages. I found it useful to experiment and often switched weapons, depending on the situation. The one black sheep of the family was the grenade. It was almost impossible to guess where it would land and quickly becomes a measure of last-resort than a helpful aide.   Just like in Singapore, the rest of Medal of Honor: Rising Sun has a new emphasis on stealth. It's a help to be quiet about killing off the Japanese soldiers so as to avoid attracting any unwanted attention. Singapore had the best use of this, using a foggy dock environment and providing only a single-shot silent handgun for a weapon. Elsewhere in the game, sneaking around corners often catches the soldiers unawares, making a quick shot or head butt with a rifle a fast end to a dangerous situation.     Even though the stealth aspect has been increased with Medal of Honor: Rising Sun, there is still an option to run and gun for most of the game, at least on normal mode. Playing through the game on the normal setting, as I usually do to see where the developer is aiming for, I found that the majority of the game was surprisingly easy. There were a few scenarios that required some forethought, but it was largely about moving forward and shooting. The enemy characters weren't even all that strong. At one point, I found myself standing still and casually reloading as a soldier stood five feet away and shot at me. I wasn't trying to show off or prove a point, I had just figured out that most of the guys will miss and their bullets weren't too powerful.   Take the game on the hard setting and it's another story. Stealth is much more of an issue and the sniper rifle becomes a godsend. Many more situations require finesse and some planning. It became a serious game where the other settings are more about a casual romp through an Indiana Jones style adventure.    After everything is said and done, Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is a historical action adventure. The game is forced to accommodate the script that history provides and puts the gamer on a straight chute all the way to the end. While the harder setting provides a more difficult game, the regular mode is geared more for a mainstream audience. It's entertaining in its own way of making history interactive and killing plenty of Japanese along the way, but it's not a thoroughly engaging or ground-breaking title.    Graphics  With such a large amount of time spent on research for Medal of Honor: Rising Sun, the graphics department seems to have slipped by the wayside. The engine sometimes has problems rendering even indoor locations, dropping the framerate down to choppy proportions. Quick turns are made a little more difficult with this in the way. It never hindered any of the action and to be honest I only noticed it when I was just walking around without a battle raging.   While the characters themselves have an accurate feeling with the appropriate uniforms, the environments themselves suffer from being a little too basic. With the slowdown I just mentioned this might be a result of the limitations of the graphics engine. Either way, aside from the Pearl Harbor missions, the rest of the game feels a bit rushed, graphically. The overall feel of the game is like a Turok sequel, only a little less refined. Some sections show some visual flair, but large stretches leave a lot to the imagination.     Instead of a smooth system, the focus has been placed once again on the historical accuracy. The Philippines, Guadalcanal, and Singapore all provide a feeling of distinct locations and make each mission feel unique. The Pearl Harbor missions truly did their job in getting the feeling of being in the attack. At the end of these levels the sense of accomplishment at shooting down the planes is balanced by a slow pan across the view of burning ships.    Sound  If Medal of Honor: Rising Sun has some negative issues with the graphics, the sound is drop-dead gorgeous. Juiced up with THX sound, it was a pleasure to hear the different sounds coming from each weapon. It's well worth it to hook up the stereo and crank it up to get yourself into the action.    Backing up the sound is a score of Asian influenced cinematic music. The Philippines have drums banging in the background and Singapore has wooden flutes whispering as you sneak from guard to guard, silently killing along the way. With an attention to detail, the music is matched up the action appropriately. Every big gun battle is amped up with plenty of backing music that's sure to get you excited and do something you hadn't quite planned.   Like a good Saturday afternoon movie, Medal of Honor: Rising Sun provides a good amount of kicks and thrills for a quick gaming session. It has some interesting story elements ripped straight from the history books and makes history live on in a first-person shooter. While a lot of work has been done to make this an accurate experience that feels and sounds right, the gameplay itself lacks the upgrade that it needs. The Medal of Honor series has built itself up on the premise of making games from World War II and has developed its own research and sound talents. Now, it needs to also work on making the war come alive by giving the player more options and having a true effect on the destiny of the game. While Medal of Honor: Rising Sun is on par with others in the series, it has let itself get in too much of a rut by not taking a good hard look at making the experience more of a game.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
