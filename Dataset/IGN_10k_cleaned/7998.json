Thanks to rose-tinted glasses, the halcyon days of gaming years gone by can often seem like a magical, wonderful world full of brilliance, rainbows and constant joy. Take the original New Zealand Story for exmaple: the briefest mention of its name in some circles is enough provoke excited whispers of glee. So, with a combination of fear - that it would be a tragically ill-conceived update - and joy - it's New Zealand Story, after all - we set about giving Dreams' latest a run for its money.   Firstly, you've got to give developer Dreams kudos for trying to stick to the original game's distinctive style. After its previous DS effort, Bubble Bobble Revolution, there were definite concerns the developer would insist on some horrific makeover for Tiki's new outing. Luckily its makeover is limited and side-by-side it's difficult to tell the difference between the two. The level layouts, enemies, power-ups and bosses will be instantly familiar to those that played the first New Zealand Story, even if Tiki does seem a little fatter and, bizarrely, sadder.   For those who haven't played the original, you play as Tiki the kiwi, a brightly yellow bird tasked with rescuing fellow kiwis who, oddly, have been kidnapped by an evil seal. Oh '80s story-telling, how we've missed you. Anyway, travelling around New Zealand with your trusty bow and arrow, the aim is to recapture your little buddies, by shooting bad guys, jumping from one platform to another and, because our yellow friend can't fly, grabbing hold of balloons to sail across the bigger, more dangerous gaps.       Surprisingly, the simple gameplay has managed to survive the ravages of time, plus Dreams has introduced some modern staples of the platform genre, including a double jump and an powerful attack you charge up. But apart from these changes New Zealand Story Revolution is a game straight out of the Eighties and, as a result, unlike many newer 2D platform games, it's surprisingly tough. Enemies constantly respawn around you, there are tricky jumps that must be negotiated while under fire, spikes which kill you in an instant and tough underwater sections that spell game over if you run out of air.   Despite this, the traditional element of the game is challenging and fun, although Dreams' attempts to include touchscreen updates results in the fun factor falling on its face. For the majority of play the bottom screen displays a haphazard radar that loosely marks the locations of exits and keys. However, now and again, an 'event' occurs that requires you to tap or stroke the stylus across the screen to help Tiki out.     These events have been poorly implemented in the game and don't gel with the rest of the game at all. What's more, they take you out of the action at crucial points, like when you're timing a difficult jump. That goes double for the spot the difference sections, in which you must pick out slight changes between the top and bottom screens while you're negotiating tough platforming sections. Ridiculous.   Rather than wasting time on these pointless additions it would've been far wiser to spend time honing the game's often sluggish controls, which are too unresponsive to properly get the most out of the game. Tiki's jumping is unwieldy, making the controls feel heavy compared to, say, New Super Mario Bros.     Likewise, the graphics, although nice, are certainly nothing special. Don't get us wrong, we're thankful Dreams didn't go the route of Bubble Bobble Revolution and change it completely, but the game would've defniitely benefited from cleaning up. For example, there are times when dangerous spikes hard to spot so you end up dying through no fault of your own. And while retro fans will be pleased with the game's almost-identical graphics, the eye-burningly bright graphics might put some people off.And that is really the main issue with New Zealand Story Revolution. For those who remember the original it's a faithful retreading of the classic with some ill-advised touchscreen elements tacked on. But for DS audiences who never experienced the original or, God forbid, weren't even born when it was released, then it all feels a bit dated. With a little more thought about level design and a more thorough graphics overhaul, Revolution could have easily stood its ground alongside New Super Mario Bros. As it is stands Tiki's deserves to go the same way as another famous flightless bird - the dodo.", "date": "Feb 2, 2007"}
