Considered a cool thing to be in the 80s and 90s, my early existence as a Skywalker supporter was a lot of fun. It was the ~in~ thing to be in those days after all, and for anyone born between 1960 and 1980 Star Wars was the glue that bound us all together. It was more than just a motion picture; it was a cultural phenomenon.   And then The Phantom Menace came out. Suddenly the world had quite the distaste for the Lucasfilm super franchise, and enjoying movies with Stormtroopers and Wookies in them wasn't so cool anymore. The videogame spin-off market faired just as poorly, with a slew of poorly conceived games flooding the stores while trying to capitalize on the Star Wars name brand. It was a dark time for Empire fans, and the powerhouse that was Vader had apparently run its course.   But the true fans hung in there and for those of us who did, we're being treated to resurgence in the quality of the movies and the games that represent the franchise. Episode II was a whole lot better than the previous installment, and LucasArts' last Star Wars game Bounty Hunter has reached new heights in terms of stage design and complexity of the puzzles. The future too, looks pretty bright; with games like Knights of the Old Republic and An Empire Divided exciting fans in anticipation of their release early next year. Yes fans, Star Wars is on its way to making a comeback, and with LucasArts and Pandemic's new action/shooter The Clone Wars, the proof is in the pudding.   Features  LucasArts has been making a conscience effort lately to pack its games with more content than your typical action title. Star Wars Bounty Hunter was a good example of such a practice, with an excess of Easter Eggs, hidden bonuses, and alternate missions that players could partake in when they weren't participating in the game's main quest. The Clone Wars follows a similar pattern with an expansive campaign mode made up of 16 primary challenges and an abundance of secondary objectives in each stage. The action takes place across six different planets including Geonosis (the location of the final battle in Episode II) and the Wookie homeworld of Kashyyyk among others, and makes for a very distinct type of experience on each world.    The secondary missions themselves are not only entertaining, they're challenging too. In the stage ~Ambush Among The Wreckage~ for instance, the player's primary goal is to get to an ambush point to surprise an enemy convoy and destroy every single unit. Once you've managed to do this, the challenge is over and it's off to the next level. Should you want to prove what a bad ass you truly are however, you can tackle the bonus objectives of locating and destroying three communication outposts, keeping all of your squad mates alive, and accomplishing everything in under six minutes. Should you do that, you'll truly defeat the stage and have bragging rights all over your neighborhood. The system works very well, and is a smart way to please patient and impatient gamers alike.   To further reward the player for being good at a particular level, you can earn special bonuses accessed in the options menu with the number of objectives you've uncovered. Extra arenas for multiplayer mode, a three-dimensional unit viewer, a ~making of~ video, a CD Player, and a sketchbook are just a few of the many unlockable goodies waiting to be discovered by attentive and determined gamers. The excellently conceived and super-fun multiplayer survival mode known as Jedi Academy is accessed through this system as well, and could be one of the best reasons to own the game (especially when playing through as Yoda and the Wookie; that's comedy folks!). But that could be said of any multiplayer option really --as the split-screen highly intensive battles can keep you and a friend glued to your television set for hours (just wait until you give the strategy feature known as Conquest a try; you can build your very own Star Wars base!). In short, LucasArts and Pandemic have done a terrific job of giving us an incentive to keep coming back to their game, and should be applauded for doing so.   Gameplay  Frequent gamers may recognize The Clone Wars as a somewhat similar game to Midway's retro remake of Defender. Or at least, at first glance it appears to be. Played from either a third or first-person point of view, you can pilot all manner of vehicles on your quest to stop the separatist movement, and whether you're on the ground as a tank or in the air with a gunship, the missions ahead of you are extremely challenging.    Made up almost exclusively of ~destroy everything~ types of missions, The Clone Wars is at its heart, an action/shooter game in a Star Wars suit. Around 90% of the time the way to defeat a mission is as simple as defending or attacking a certain group of weaponry and calling it a day. Every now and then, however, the missions will vary slightly in execution with a ~pick up and drop off~ mentality or lightsaber battles that take place outside the cockpit of your vehicle where you must, you guessed it, destroy everything. And then of course, you have the secondary missions I mentioned earlier in 'Features' that expand the challenge parameters beyond the usual straightforward destruction. Somehow the basic setup finds a way to not be repetitive, and flying through each area with guns blazing is a great deal of fun regardless of which difficulty setting you're playing on.   It's not all wine and roses though, as the lightsaber missions leave a lot to be desired. Overly forgiving collision and stiff character movement is the best way to describe the remedial lightsaber challenges on their best day, and length and the lack of difficulty in that perspective is definitely on the low end. It's almost as though the mode was added in as an afterthought, and it may have been a wiser choice to include a few more vehicle stages instead of the chance to play as Windu, Skywalker, or Kenobi. Besides, none of those three characters play differently from one another anyway, so what does it matter?   Assuming control of your various craft is something else entirely. Responsive and unique, each of the different vehicles has their own manipulation schematics and allows you a multitude of actions. Strafing, turbo boosts, primary and secondary weapons, and other such actions will change from ship to ship as your progress, but for the most part your driving experience should be intuitive and unhampered. That is until the latter levels when there's so much activity the framerate makes it difficult to steer. In ~Anakin's Escape~ in particular, your race through the forest is difficult not because of the guard towers and mobile batteries attacking you, but as a result of the near 20-FPS performance of the screen.    There are a few other strange little anomalies that get in the way of making the game run as smoothly as it should as well. Like the fact that larger enemy and ally vehicles floating above your craft still find a way to keep you from advancing forward. Or should I say, they create an invisible wall that you can't penetrate simply because they're occupying that space -- regardless of how high they are. If you're keeping score, that isn't a good thing. There's also a high ratio of low damage bumps when you run into things accidentally. Supposedly moving at high speed in a craft that contains a huge amount of energy, it doesn't make any sense that you can bounce off a tree or rock several times without accruing any sort of real damage. I think that once Pandemic realized that the framerate problems made it difficult to navigate through certain obstacles, they turned the damage flags down extremely low to compensate. I don't know that for a fact mind, it's just a theory.   Despite those problems The Clone Wars is still very playable. When cranked all the way up to the highest difficulty setting, the action gets pretty intense and truly feels like you're playing through your very own Star Wars movie. For fans of the franchise, it's going to drive you wild.   Graphics  The Clone Wars is beautiful and tragic at the same time. Possessing a number of highly detailed, universe-inspired structures and some very impressive vehicle models, Star Wars is terrific looking at first glance. Resembling the same CG-created tanks and ships that we saw in the finale of the second film, the futuristic war machines move and react just as you would expect them to, and fans of the series will be pleased at how well represented these spacecraft really are (though the textures from the GameCube version have an additional crispness and richness of color that the PS2 rendition clearly does not, and the draw-in can get quite bad at times).   The special effects as well, are spot on and remain consistent with the standards set in previous films and games over the last couple of decades. And when seen in conjunction with the vast amount of particles populating the screen at any one time, the resulting effect is quite remarkable. Smoking scorched earth burns in various places on the map, while hundreds of independent units battle each other around the action. Almost everything is destructible, be it enemy, ally, vehicle, or structure, and with the exception of mountains and other natural obstacles, the landscape can change dramatically over the course of the war. It all adds up to a game that conveys an interstellar space battle the likes of which can only be matched by the pre-release demo we've played of Battle Engine Aquilla; which for those of you who don't know, is pretty impressive.    Unfortunately, as we mentioned earlier, the frame rate is pretty terrible. Already bad on the Nintendo GameCube, the PlayStation 2 version is as choppy as the come and chugs along at an almost slide show pace. This lack of speed in the animation really detracts from the visuals more often than it should, and every now and then, can alter the accuracy of your vehicle's steering. Fine and dandy when the game is running smooth, your airships will suddenly start bumping into things into mountains and artificial towers the moment the screen begins to hiccup. Had the developers optimized this aspect just a little bit more, The Clone Wars could have been in the running for one of the best looking PS2 games this year, but instead will have to settle somewhere in the above-average category.   Oh and one more thing; the character models could use some serious work. Resembling stick figures with painted suits of armor, human beings and similar creatures are about as believable as the Easter Bunny. The only way I'd buy that the clone troopers in The Clone Wars were somewhat realistic, is if you proved to me somehow that Jack Skellington replaced Jango Fett as the prototype for the soldiers -- Yes, they're that goofy looking.   Sound  John Williams is easily on par with the great Danny Elfman as one of the top composers in motion pictures today. Considered by many to be his greatest work ever, the Williams-produced Star Wars music is one of the most recognizable sets in existence, and his with the exception of the stellar soundtrack of The Empire Strikes Back, Episode II could be the best in the series. The Clone Wars producers appeared to have agreed and have lifted the soundtrack from the motion picture almost exactly. Designed rather effectively by Skywalker Sound, each song fits individual situations perfectly. Although it would have been cool had the soundtrack been more dynamic and change on the fly based on the type of trouble you're in.    The support effects are just as snazzy, with explosions and laser blasts sourced directly from the movies series. Every boom, hiss, and the like will spark a familiar chord with Star Wars fans the moment they hear them, with the only detracting factor falling under the banner of ~been there, done that~ (after all, how many times have we heard these laser shrieks in a game before anyway?). Vocally, Anakin, Mace, and Obi-Wan are portrayed by sound-alike actors rather than the original stars in the film and for the most part do a pretty good job of capturing their traits and mannerisms. Though it's obvious that these aren't the originals.Sometimes your game doesn't have to be perfect to be fun. Hampered by a serious framerate issue, collision detection problems, and various other tidbits, Star Wars: The Clone Wars still manages to shine through as a solid science fiction blaster. Sure it's better on GameCube, but who cares? It's still a game that'll be appreciated on a higher level by fans of the movie franchise (like myself) and casual fans as well. Technically flawed but spiritually powerful, Clone Wars is worth a look.", "date": "Dec 13, 2002"}
