The game includes a vast assortment of colleges to choose from, so as long as you didn't attend Timbuktu State, you should be able to find your Alma Mater and attempt to win them a national title. NCAA Final Four 2003 also includes a nice selection of different types of season and dynasty modes, so if length and depth is your thing, this game has options for you.   For the most part though, the game is very similar to last year's effort. There have been a few enhancements and adjustments, although the game hasn't gone through as many changes as one would have hoped.   Gameplay  Just like last year, NCAA Final Four 2003 has plenty of game modes to keep you occupied through the college basketball season, and then some. There's the standard Quick Start, which lets you jump into a game with two randomly selected teams, or you can play in Exhibition mode or start a tournament. For those who want a longer and deeper experience, there are the Season, Dynasty and Career modes.    Season mode lets you take a school through a single season, while Dynasty will let you control a college through the course of many seasons. The Career mode lets you follow the path of a coach, where you start as a Graduate Assistant at a small college, and try and work your way up to a Head Coach position at a top college. Your record for each season will determine whether you get to keep your current job, and whether any new positions are offered to you. In both the Dynasty and Career modes, you'll be able to recruit new players, and watch seniors retire.   The Dynasty and Career modes play the same for the most part, with the exception that Career has you follow a coach through multiple jobs, rather than a single school though part of its history. The recruitment aspect of both modes is done OK, but it can be improved upon. Each year you'll be given a certain number of recruitment visits you can spend, depending on your position at the school. You'll then be able to pick a state, view its top prospects, and try and woo them to attend your school. It sounds nice on paper, but all it really boils down to is picking a player and clicking a button. If he wasn't already interested in attending your school, there isn't much you can do to help him change his mind. It also would be nice to be able to follow a player for an extended time, especially while he's still active so that things could change as far as stats and numbers go while you follow him, but this isn't the case.   One cool feature is being able to change the workout regime for your players. You'll see a weekly chart with hours assigned to it, and a slew of practice types, including laps, shooting, free throws, etc. You can change how many hours per day you want your team to train, and which areas they should focus on. If you've got a bunch of strong guys who can't shoot, ignore the weights and have them practice shooting the rock. If you've got a bunch of scrawny guys who can make shots from practically anywhere, but tire easily, have them do plenty of laps.   This year, the game allows players to perform moves that'll let you drive to the basket, so it's a bit easier to move up the paint than last year. By pressing the right analog stick to the side, your players will try and side step the defense. For the most part, though, the defense will still act like walls, and these juke moves are only really effective if you're right near the basket, and immediately follow the move with a shot. Trying to spin around a player from near the 3-point line is usually ineffective. At least it's easier to drive to the basket from underneath, which is a welcome improvement.   The game still uses the Touch Passing, which has been tweaked a little for the better, but there are still some balancing issues. For those unfamiliar with Touch Shooting, it's a shot meter that determines whether you make the basket or not. Stats still play a part in things, such as how far your player is able to shoot from, and how much you're able to miss a perfect alignment and still make the basket, but the meter still heavily relies on timing skill. The Touch Passing meter looks like a rectangle with a circle on top. When you press Circle to shoot, a basketball icon starts moving from the bottom of the rectangle up to the circle. The goal is to release Circle when the ball is in the circlular area, and you'll make the shot.   The meter moves faster than last year, so it's a bit harder to sink every basket, but it's still easy to have an extremely high 3-point shot percentage with a decent shooter. It's also still odd how shots are determined whether they're made or not with the meter. You can misalign the meter by shooting early and line the ball up low in the meter, but still make the shot. But if you shoot just too late and line the meter up a little high, you'll miss most every time. How you align the meter also has no bearing on how the ball is shot, either. Missing high on the meter should cause the ball to be shot too far, resulting in the ball going off the backboard, and shooting early should result in a short shot, or even an air ball. Unfortunately neither of these happen, and the resulting miss is randomly placed. Even missing the shot as much as possible won't result in an air ball, unless your player was fouled while they were shooting. When using the meter, you'll also never see a shot that goes off the backboard and in. The only time that anyone uses the backboard is during a lay-up.   Attempting to shoot the ball while under the basket will sometimes result in shots that aren't expected. For instance, you might think your player should dunk the ball, but he'll go for a lay-up instead. This isn't so bad, since you still get the two points and only miss out on a more humiliating scoring animation, but it gets annoying when the Touch Shooting meter appears when you didn't expect it to. Sometimes when you might expect a dunk, your player will take a normal shot, and the shot meter will appear. If you're not ready for it, you'll likely miss. It's a pretty sad thing when players miss a reasonable percentage of their shots from right under the basket.    The AI still needs some serious work. The computer-controlled players still hardly move on offense unless you call a specific play. When playing against the computer, its offense will often times become completely inactive. There are plenty of moments where one of its players will have the ball, and the rest of its team will just stand around, and not bother to try and get open. After dribbling the ball aimlessly in place for five seconds or so, one player will pass to another, that player will stand around for a while, and so on until someone finally takes a shot. Sometimes if the computer is alone under the net with the ball, he won't even bother to take a shot. He'll sometimes just move away from the basket, and then attempt to drive in again. Or what's even better is when he just passes it out again, and wastes an easy basket.   The game's AI is also sometimes clueless as to what's going on around it. You can pass the ball all the way down court, and none of the players will react to the incoming ball until your player takes possession. You can pressure the offense when they're getting ready to inbound the ball, and they'll still pass to their players as if you aren't there. Even after they get the ball, they'll take their sweet time moving up court, completely ignoring the fact that you are continuously trying to strip the ball from their possession. They won't bother trying to pass the ball away to prevent you from stealing it.   There are some other fairly annoying issues with the AI. Sometimes when getting ready to pass the ball inbounds, your target player will stand out of bounds. You'll have to bring up the icon passing to get it to someone who's actually in bounds, like where any normal basketball player will usually try and stand.   Graphics  The game looks a little different than last year, but it's not really all that much prettier. This year, the engine makes use of specular lighting to add a shine to players' shorts, jerseys and skin. The result is nice and somewhat noticeable, but it's not as dynamic as 989 would probably have hoped. Instead of it looking like the light is shining as players move around, the shine mostly looks painted on. It actually is changing as players move, but it's not noticeable enough to produce any sort of ~wow~ factor. If this is tweaked a little more for next year, it might provide a nice graphical improvement.   Player models look about as good as they did last year, which is to say that they look decent, but not great. They contain a reasonable amount of detail, but the players aren't varied enough to give any sort of unique look to each model. Muscular and facial detail is fairly nice, ball all the players are of the same build. It would be nice to see some really skinny guys, and a couple of gargantuan monsters at center.   The game still suffers a bit from lackluster animation. Everything works, I suppose, but the animation is bland enough to make the game look a little boring. The dunks aren't very exciting, and there aren't many cool shot animations. There's nothing about the animation that really hurts the game, but there also isn't anything good enough to help draw you into the action.   Sound  The sound is much like the graphics in that it works, but there's nothing great to speak of. Missed shots, dunks, dribbling and everything else sound all right, and they get the job done. Don't be expecting to show off your new surround-sound system with this game, though. There really isn't much to the sound effects that isn't expected.    The commentary is OK, but it can get a bit repetitive. If you shoot a lot of 3-pointers, be prepared to here something about a ~home-run ball~ time and time again. For the most part, though, the commentary works reasonably well, and they don't make too many glaring mistakes.  NCAA Final Four 2003 plays very similar to last year's Final Four, and that wasn't exactly the best college basketball game on the market. The game still has plenty of modes to take a school through, but there are still too many problems with the AI to make the game worth playing for an extended career.There are also still balancing issues with the Touch Shooting, in that it's too easy to score once you master the timing. You can turn it off, but then the only unique gameplay feature you're left with is the clueless AI.", "date": "Nov 11, 2002"}
