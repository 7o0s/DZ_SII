It's certainly a lot cooler than American fighting, unless that American is Chuck Norris, or maybe Guile from Street Fighter. So a game based on a cartoon, about martial arts should be cool right? What if it captures the look of the show, and features voicework from very main character, and then some? Throw in multiplayer minigames and this game should be awesome. So it's a little puzzling that Razorback Development's Xiaolin Showdown is such a letdown, for gamers and fans of the series.    Fans of the show should already be familiar with the premise, but for those that haven't dedicated themselves to Xiaolin (pronounced Shaolin), here's the scoop. Omi, Kimiko, Clay, and Raimundo are all monks in training. Together they must try to collect the Shen Gong Wu, mystical power-filled talismans, before evil forces do. Omi and the other monks travel all over the world, finding the Shen Gong Wu. When two or more people come upon a Shen Gong Wu at the same time, a Xiaolin Showdown occurs. It seems a little complicated, but the plot is pretty formulaic. Good guys travel somewhere, find a talisman, battle the bad guy, somebody wins. Repeat as necessary.    With a title based around the premise of beating stuff up, it's no surprise that Xiaolin Showdown is a, that's right, beat-em-up game. Players control one of the four main characters, battling their way through level after level of bad guys. It's all been done before, but Xiaolin Showdown tries to add in a few things to make the experience a little more unique.    Combos in the game are earned through a combo tree system and tokens found in the levels. At first, all the character has is a basic punch, kick, and elemental attack. By collecting the tokens hidden in the levels, players can by moves for the combos, allowing them to string the attacks together. It's a neat idea in theory, but a lot of it is really useless. Most of the time players won't have an opportunity to use the bigger combos. A couple characters have combo trees consisting of all punches or all kicks, and those seem to work well. But it turns the game into a button masher, which gets tedious pretty quickly.    The main problem with the combo system has nothing to do with the combos themselves, but with the enemies. The isometric view allows for a near 3D playing field, but attacks are really limited to one direction at a time. The bad guys will all charge the player at once, often attacking from multiple angles. Sometimes players will be lucky to get two hits off before they get punched in the back of the head by some weird green monster or a robot cheerleader. There aren't a lot of moves that can attack multiple enemies, besides the elemental attack (which takes a little bit to start up, often getting interrupted before it can finish) and some of the Shen Gong Wu. Both of them take Chi energy to perform, which requires beating up enemies. It's a vicious cycle! The whole enemy AI system is wonky, and it makes the game either frustrating, or ridiculously easy. Players will either find themselves getting gang raped by baddies, or watch as enemies run themselves into the level traps or accidentally attack each other.    The annoying enemies become a nuisance, since this game has a lot of them, of all different types, for each level. The levels are pretty long, and varied, but it would have been nice to have a bit more story between them. For instance, at one point Omi and crew must travel inside their dragon friend, but players are never really given an explanation as to how this occurred. Seems like a nitpick, sure, but for fans of the show, story means a lot, and this game just doesn't have any.    It's a shame that the game is weak in the story department, because it looks fantastic. The cell shaded characters and environments capture the feel of the show very well, and all of the Shen Gong Wu attacks are varied and pretty cool to see. Before each level, there's a clip taken directly from the cartoon (in place of where story would be), and although it doesn't inform much, it's still kind of a neat addition, especially on a handheld.       Even the sound is mildly impressive for the game. The voice actors lend their talents in certain parts, mostly to yell out the names of their elemental attacks, or Shen Gong Wu names. The music is just sort of there, nothing too noticeable, but it doesn't get too annoying either, which is good. Some of the Xiaolin Showdown games need the sound on though.    Surprisingly, there are actually four multiplayer minigames included in Xiaolin Showdown. They're all Xiaolin themed arcade style games. Air hockey, Breakout, bowling, and a bizarre bumper ball game. Air Hockey and Breakout use both screen, but the game doesn't account for the gap, so it makes it awkward to play. The controls on Air Hockey are nearly broken too, which makes it an almost worthless game. Shame too, since a DS air hockey game is a great idea. The bumper balls game, dubbed Water Warriors, is actually a lot of fun. Players have to stretch their character using the touch screen and then roll into the other monks, trying to knock them into water. Xiaolin Showdown is not a very good game. It looks and sounds great, but that's not enough to recommend it. Maybe with an original story for the game, fans of the show could overlook the mediocre at best gameplay and just button mash their way through it. The minigames are actually more fun than the game itself, and that's sad, since half of the minigames suck pretty bad.
