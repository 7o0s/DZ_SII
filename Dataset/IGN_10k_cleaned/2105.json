EA Sports has already released what's considered by many to be the best football videogame ever made and by the end of the year the system will have no less than six different titles for people to choose from if you include the college games. One of these six titles, and the third overall and second NFL title to make it to the market for this upcoming season, is Acclaim's NFL QB Club 2002, the latest release in the company's famed franchise that saw most of its glory on the Nintendo 64.    Play Modes The biggest selling point of this game is that it features the exclusive NFL Quarterback Club license and because of this is the only game in town that has the Quarterback Challenge. However, while the Quarterback Challenge, which features all four real events (Speed and Mobility, Accuracy Event, Long Distance Throw, and Read and Recognition), can be pretty fun when played with a group of friends and even all alone, it's obviously far from something that anyone would buy a game for.   It's a nice gameplay mode nonetheless and if you had two games that were completely equal and one had the QB Challenge and the other didn't, it'd definitely make the decision of which game to buy an easy one. That just isn't the case here, as what NFL QB Club 2002 brings to the table is a far cry from what you can find elsewhere, even with the Challenge.   While the game does have all of the now-basic play modes like Exhibition, Season, Practice, Playoffs, and Simulation (which lets you setup gameplay situations any way that you'd like it), it's missing the all-important franchise mode. Even though this probably doesn't matter to the casual fan, diehard football gamers have come expect this in their games. Without it, the game doesn't have the depth or long term play value that you're going to be able to get elsewhere, and the QB Challenge doesn't come close to making up for this.  Player Control There are basically two types of control types that you'll get in a football videogame on a console -- simulation and arcade. Even though it arguably has a lot of arcade aspects, the Madden control where player momentum won't allow you to make cuts on a dime without losing speed is what's generally considered simulation. Likewise, the player control in the NFL 2K and GameDay series, where sharp cuts can be made without loss of speed, is what's typically considered arcade control. For better or worse, depending completely on your personal tastes, the control here in NFL QB Club 2002 falls more in line with the GameDays and NFL 2Ks than it does with the Maddens of the world.  Player movement is really tight and the onscreen athletes react quickly and precisely with your controller movements. Cuts can be made often and without any loss in speed and you can do wacky 360 moves to try and avoid tackles and not worry about things like momentum and physics. If this is the way you like your football games to play, then continue on, but if you completely object to this kind of a game, then you might as well stop right now.  As a ~football simulation with arcade controls~, QB Club 2002 isn't all that bad. With the ball you can do stiff arms, spins and jukes, but they seem to be a lot less effective than just using your skills with the control stick (you know, them old-school jukes where you actually move the player and not have a button do it for you). The control is very responsive and you'll rarely be put into a situation where you'll feel that the onscreen player did something that you didn't want him to do.  Gameplay & AI Even though the control is good, things start to fall apart to some extents when you start to delve deeper into the little nuisances of the game. Even though the defensive play calling is pretty advanced, as you can pick the formation, coverage and play instead of just the formation and play, the play calling in general is hampered a bit by a poor setup.   It only allows you to see only one play on both offense and defense at a time, so even though you have the names of three plays onscreen, you can only actually see one of them. This is okay once you've gotten to know your play book through and through, but isn't as efficient as it ought to be.  Furthermore, there's not really a noticeable difference in the offensive plays that you're able to use when you go from team to team, as you won't find the plays for a team that runs a West Coast offense to be any different from one that doesn't.   There are also a lot of seemingly trivial problems with the AI that proved to be a bigger problem when taken on the whole. While the blocking schemes of the lineman start off realistically enough during the beginning of the plays and it correctly following the blocks is very important, it all breaks down sometimes after the initial routes. After the normal blocking routine is completed, you'll encounter some plays where the offensive lineman, whether in front of you or behind you, will move in conjunction with the cuts of your back. Subsequently, running on these plays becomes of art of using your ball carrier's movements to position the lineman in front of him for blocks instead of reading what's down field.   The worst thing, though, is that the AI just doesn't prove to be all that challenging even on the game's highest level. Whether using the running game, the passing game or a fine mixture, it's simply far too easy to move the ball on the defense, even on the highest difficulty setting and with a bad offensive team against a team like the Ravens. Games will be challenging at times, but it's usually because of some freak interceptions or random plays where the defense completely runs over your lineman. The game just lacks balance and needs a lot more polish.   Graphics Even though some people like to say that graphics don't mean anything, that's just not the truth. If it were true, we wouldn't see new consoles released every three to five years and 3D graphics cards on the PC wouldn't be upgraded every six months. Graphics do matter and it's here where NFL QB Club 2002 suffers the most.  When you see this game in motion, you will not think of the ~power of PlayStation 2~ or any advanced next-generation console. The animation is second-rate and while the player models and environments are decently textured, the framerate can be appalling at times and the game simply doesn't look like it belongs on powerful gaming console like the PlayStation 2, or even something a little less powerful like the Dreamcast.  The game is supposed to feature more than 1,500 all-new motion-captured animations, and while this may be true, the problem isn't with the number of animations but the quality of them. Player movement is generally choppy and the transition between movements is almost completely non-existent. For example, there's not an animation for the transitional movement from an offensive lineman being in his stance and taking his pull step on a trap play. Instead, what you'll see is just the lineman rotate around while still motionless and in his original stance and then run forward for the trap block.  And it's like this in many other facets of the game, so the player is constantly reminded that this is only a videogame and not a very good looking one at that. It might not have been as much of a problem back in the days of the PlayStation and Nintendo 64, but ever since Sega released NFL 2K on Dreamcast, the stakes have been raised.   The player models are also a bit ~off~. They're acceptable for the most part and the game does offer a nice variety of player shapes and sizes, but some of the proportions aren't quite right on some of them. Some players will have triceps that bulge out twice as much as the player's biceps. And while the triceps are what make an arm look fuller, the bulge isn't as large as what one will see in the biceps. The player numbers on the jerseys also seem somewhat stretched out, almost as if they started with one texture size for a player of a certain height and decided to make them taller at a later stage in development while not changing the texture.   The largest problem, though, is the framerate. There's a lot of slowdown here and it happens mostly during the gameplay, which just isn't acceptable. You'll see most of it as you drop the quarterback back on passing plays, but it also occurs at numerous other spots during the play -- mostly when the camera pans quickly.   It's not all bad here, though. The developers have scanned the faces of more than 350 starting NFL players and most of them accurately depict their real-life counterparts. There are also a lot of nice little touches like blinking eyes, emotion shown by the players through their facial expressions, cool footprints that will fade away in the snow, and helmets that will get knocked off (happens a bit too much, though). Likewise, the lighting for the different times of the day are good and the stadiums are highly detailed and there are 3D objects and players that populate the sidelines.   Sound The game's play-by-play is handled by Kevin Harlan the color commentary work is performed by Bill Maas, who happened to be the first to break the news of Jimmy Johnson's planned retirement after the 1998 season for those interested. Even though their voices do show some enthusiasm and you'll here an occasional whimsical comment here and there, what you're getting here is pretty average stuff and what's said will often not necessarily reflect what just happened on the field. Harlan will sometimes comment on a great play by the defensive back when what really happened was a wide open received dropped a pass.  As far as the sound effects are concerned, it's quite reminiscent of what you'd hear in an old Madden game on the 16-bit systems. The crunches and hits have a very arcade-ish smack sound to them and the general football noises aren't something that one would describe as being realistic. The crowd noises are, again, standard with what you'd expect from a football game. Nothing obnoxiously bad, but nothing really special that makes it stand out or improve upon this area in comparison to past games.

With live chats, real-time audio and interactive polls, you can experience NFL action like never before. The biggest problem with NFL QB Club 2002 is that it's up against some big-time competition. The recently released Madden NFL 2002 from EA Sports is arguably the greatest game that we've ever seen and unlike other genres where it's common to buy, play and enjoy several different games at one time, it's not typically the case with something as specific as ~NFL football~. What's more, NFL QB Club 2002 isn't even in the same league as Madden. It's not a horrible playing game by any means and there's enough good that can be seen in the gameplay department that makes us believe that Acclaim does have some strong football minds working on the project, but it lacks the polish and completeness that's available elsewhere. The bottom line is that we can't think of a legitimate reason to go out and buy this game. The Quarterback Challenge is admittedly enjoyable, but it doesn't add enough value to the game to make it worthwhile purchase. All this said, if Acclaim is able to keep this team together and allow them the resources to make the improvements needed, the NFL QB Club franchise might be a contender one or two years down the road.", "date": "Sep 7, 2001"}
