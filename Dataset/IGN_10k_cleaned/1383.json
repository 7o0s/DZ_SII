{"name": "Kessen", "name_review": "Kessen", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/24/kessen", "text": "One of the few intelligent things I managed to say off the cuff in six years of post-secondary education was in a junior history seminar, when the professor, by way of getting everyone to introduce themselves, asked us to explain why we had decided to study history.  When my turn came around, for some reason (although it probably had something to do with the amount of Bad Religion I listened to at the time), I said ~Because truth is not only stranger than fiction, it is usually far more entertaining.~  It's funny because it's true, and if you disagree, you can shut up and borrow my copy of The Twelve Caesars or Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.  What real personalities wind up doing in the course of real events handily outmatches most creations of the imagination when it comes to holding my interest.  That's one of the coolest things about Koei's Kessen, because despite the highly fanciful visual presentation, this game is actually about real people, and its cinematic presentation brings them to life in a way that makes the strategy gameplay much more exciting.  It helps, of course, that Kessen is one of the best-looking PS2 launch titles, and was produced by some of the most experienced masters of simulation game design.  This is a major leap forward for Koei, to produce such a different take on the type of game that has been their core business for so long, but it's a gamble that's paid off, and with Kessen II already in the works and looking amazing, I wouldn't be surprised if the ascendance of PS2 also marks their step out of the niche that they've remained in for so long.  History  Allow me my little conceit.  Although I can assure you that nobody in feudal Japan wore armor that looked quite this silly, the people, places, and events in Kessen are for the most part entirely real, and a short history lesson might help some players appreciate the game a bit more.  ~Kessen~ is Japanese for ~decisive battle~ - an appropriate title, because the events of the game are built around the most decisive conflict in Japanese history.  When you first play the game, you take on the role of Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of the most powerful warlords in the period of turmoil that preceded the long peace of the Edo period.  After the decline in the power of the emperor and the Ashikaga shoguns in the 15th and 16th centuries, Japan was essentially under the control of daimyo, local lords who exerted great influence in a small area - like Germany after the fall of the Holy Roman Emperors, or Italy during the Renaissance.  Warlords attempted to unify the country, the most famous and almost successful campaign being waged by Nobunaga Oda in the latter half of the 16th century (the inspiration, of course, for the Nobunaga's Ambition games), but the first man to actually retake total control of Japan was Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who picked up where Nobunaga left off after his assassination.    Toyotomi ruled the country with an iron fist from 1590 until his death in 1598, at which point turmoil arose over who would succeed him.  In theory, it was to be his son Hideyori, but Hideyori's weakness (he was a baby at the time) gave rise to a challenge from Tokugawa, one of Hideyoshi's generals.  Tokugawa raised an army to fight against the Toyotomi loyalists, and at the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he defeated the western army of Ishida Mitsunari, destroying the last meaningful opposition to his eventual appointment as shogun.  Gameplay  Sekigahara is the decisive battle of the title, where you mass your forces, gather your generals, and fight a running campaign to eventually defeat Ishida (or Tokugawa, in the unlockable alternate campaign).  The battle, the events leading up to it, and all the personalities and side-stories that had an influence on the larger picture are all presented as part of a vast cinematic tableau - it may sound like I have a touch of the hyperbole in me, but this game has a genuinely epic feel to it.  It's a little hard to nail down the fundamental idea behind Kessen, but I think it's intended to be Koei for people who don't like Koei.  If you have no idea what Koei is, and that's a possibility, let me backtrack a little bit.  For twenty years, Koei has been producing historical strategy games for PCs and consoles, the Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms series.  Turn-based war simulations set, respectively, in feudal Japan and third-century China, these games have, over the years, refined and developed their formula down to a proverbial science.  That's all well and good if you happen to like that particular formula, but it's one that's been tailored to suit the preference of a small fanbase, one that's continually diminished (at least on this side of the water) until hardly anyone remembers those games anymore, let alone avidly follows them.    Kessen, then, takes the idea of historical simulation and updates in a format that's more accessible to a new audience.  In addition to its flashy new graphical presentation, Kessen moves away from the total war simulation of Koei's other games into a somewhat more focused realm.  It's basically just a combat simulation, with most of the logistic and political elements removed.  The only affairs you'll take care of when you're off the battlefield are rudimentary matters of officer development and enemy recruitment - the lion's share of your time will be spent directing your armies across the battlefield, organizing their movement, managing their morale and special attacks, and keeping an eye out for whatever dirty tricks the other side is trying to pull.  Battles move in real time, but not at the pace or on the scale of most PC RTS games - command and control in Kessen doesn't require nearly as much frantic micromanagement as something like StarCraft or Command & Conquer.  You can survey most of the battlefield at any given time, via the most distant viewpoint or the inset mini-map, and you don't usually have so many units that you can't keep track of them all.  The heads-up display (which is well-designed once you adjust to how small some of the indicators are) gives you a handy icon-based rundown of the generals under your command, with color-coded indications of their basic status, and you can use the shoulder buttons or the D-pad to shuffle through them and see what they're doing at any given time.  Select one, and then you can pick from among the options available to that unit - movement, attack, defense, and special maneuevers are the commands you'll use most often.  Special maneuvers are the most interesting option, extra-powerful attacks that certain units can use at certain times.  Depending on what type of troops a general commands (archers, arquebusiers, cavalry, spearmen), he can a given special maneuver, and his proficience at that maneuver develops over time.  As a unit gains experience, its existing maneuvers get stronger and it can learn new ones.  When the unit's morale rating rises over a given level - morale being affected by the flow and events of battle - their icon on the HUD flashes, and you can unleash their attack on an enemy within range.  A special cutscene unfolds, and you'll do extra damage to the opponent, or your unit will gain some sort of advantage.  You can't build your entire strategy around flashy tricks, though - you still need to learn basic wargame techniques like how to attack in concert, when to commit your reserves, the effects of terrain and fortifications, and so on.  This is where the game may grow repetitive in the eyes of some, but the feeling of scale and scope holds up thanks to the fairly quick pace of battles.  If you feel like being impressed, you can always zip down into the squad-level micromanagement mode, where you see all your little polygonal troops arrayed in combat across a particular part of the battlefield.  Graphics  That was what impressed us about Kessen back in the early days of PS2, and the same holds true now - there are a lot of troops on that battlefield, they all look good, and they're all active, running around doing different things.  After seeing things like Kessen II's tornado sequence in person, I can't help but think occasionally about the advances being made over the original Kessen's realtime battles, but the 100 troops Kessen fits into any given scene is still quite a feat.  When you see something like a massed cavalry charge, or a barrage by three ranks of muskets, the effect is impressive both on a large scale and thanks to small details, like particle effects for dirt kicked up by horses and smoke from explosions.  Outside battle, Kessen includes both realtime and pre-rendered cutscenes, but you may not be able to immediately tell the difference until you note the interlace flicker in the former sequences.  Now that I've brought up the subject, though, I'll note that those sorts of graphical glitches are rarely an issue in this game.  The character models are remarkably lifelike, thanks especially to the detailed and realistic facial animation, and the sequences are very well-directed, including some exciting one-on-one duels and confrontations.  It's too bad that the cutscene animation shows up the spontaneous animations in the regular battles so much (the characters in the squad-level view tend to move rather stiffly), but such is life at this point in technological development.  Sound  Continuing the tale of Kessen's many and varieed cutscenes, which build the cinematic framework that gives meaning to the mechanical battle sequences, Koei giveth, and Electronic Arts taketh away.  I applaud EA's decision to pick up Kessen for publication in the states, since that means the game will get a far stronger marketing push than it otherwise would have (and I love the shiny American logo), but I have a question to ask of their localization staff.  Here we have a game that is Japanese.  It is set in Japan, in a real time and place, with real historical figures, all Japanese.  Why are these characters not allowed to speak Japanese?  I mean, logic dictates that they would speak Japanese, since the only foreign incursions at this point in Japan's history were by the Portuguese, if memory serves.  But no, they all speak English, and badly-dubbed English to boot.  I can feel all you little thugs rushing to e-mail me, and I don't want to hear it.  Would you pay the price of an art-house ticket and make the time to see the one-week-only re-release of Ran if it had a lousy dub?  No, you wouldn't - anybody with any respect for film would be disgusted by something like that.  But this is a game, so nobody cares.  Is there some sort of edict out of SCEA saying ~Thou shalt have naught but crummy English voice acting in thy games~?  Maybe that would explain this, and DOA2 to boot.  Enough of my rancid geek bile.  Aside from the voices, Kessen has an amazing soundtrack - the music has an Epic (yes, Epic, not just ~epic~) feel that adds even more impact to the battles and cutscenes.  Even without music, the clash of swords and spears when you zoom in on a battle is a powerful accompaniment, as is the thunder of hooves during an engagement between horsemen.   Though whoever commissioned the dub will be smitten at the last by the hammer of justice, Kessen is a great game otherwise, one of the best-looking, and more than that the most accessible console strategy title to come down the pike in a long while.  The cinematic presentation lends an immediacy and significance to each battle, which is something that's missing from the long, repetitive campaigns of their older strategy titles.  The graphics tarts who'll be drawn in by the flashy cutscenes might claim to have been bait-and-switched once they discover exactly what they've bought, but they can go rot - there's substance beneath Kessen's style to give it staying power for serious gamers, including an entire new campaign (where you play the role of Ishida).If you know you don't want to play this sort of game, feel free to give it a pass - it's still pretty strongly rooted in the old Koei strategy tradition, which will never have entirely universal appeal.  If you've never given historical strategy a go, though, Kessen is a great introduction for beginners, and if it hooks you, there's much more waiting for you in the genre.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
