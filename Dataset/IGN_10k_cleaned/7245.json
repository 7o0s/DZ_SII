Not necessarily because it's fun to play, but rather because it takes forever to get through a round. The game fuses a three-click golf system with RPG character building elements in an online environment, free of monthly subscription charges. Offered are a variety of courses both realistic and fantastical, plenty of item upgrades, consumable power ups, tournaments, and a guild system. While it's great to play golf online against people instead of boring computer A.I., Shot-Online has numerous problems.   You start the game as a lowly level one, and are treated to a quick tutorial as you first log in to the game world. The shot system works well, but then again it's nothing really new. Click once to start a swing, click again to set power, then again to set accuracy. Depending on how close you are to the accuracy bar, your shot's trajectory is affected dramatically. Too early or too late a click can either slightly cause a slice or hook, or an embarrassing duff if you're too far off. It's actually a challenging click system that takes a while to get used to, which is a good thing. In addition to the hooks and slices, it's possible to specify where on the ball you want to hit it, causing backspin, topspin, draw, or fade. Again, it's functional, but fairly standard.    Actually hitting the ball takes a lot of guesswork when you first start out, especially since you need to consider lie, weather conditions, and foot angle. The game lets you know where the wind is coming from and where your ball will theoretically land, but it's up to the player to get a feel for their power to judge impact strength. This become more of an issue on greens, where there's very little information regarding how far your putt will travel at a given power level. Instead, a significant amount of guesswork is required to read the imprecise slope displays. Eventually you get a general feel for it, but the slopes never seem to affect the ball consistently.   As your level and statistics increase, properly smacking the ball becomes more of an important affair. For instance, with a low level power statistic, the ball's going to struggle to get near 200 yards on your longest drive, so it's not as big a deal if you're a little off center with your shot. However, if you're driving the ball 300 yards or more every time, it's obviously more of an issue if you're imprecise since you'll be landing 100 or so yards off course. This goes for the other statistics of stamina, impact, and skill. At higher levels, they'll dramatically influence your ability to spin, draw, and fade the ball, meaning you'll have to be more careful.    One annoyance in the game is the fatigue system. In an attempt to mimic golfers getting tired as they play, a fatigue meter builds the longer you're on the course. If it gets too high, it can adversely affect your shots. This isn't much of a problem at first since you level up pretty quickly, which resets the fatigue bar each time. However, if you've actually built up a significant amount of rest you need to either consume an item to get rid of it, or sit on a bench. Fatigue doesn't deplete quickly, either, so you'll need to sit on a bench for upwards of 15 minutes before you're back to normal. It's not exactly fun.   These fatigue restoring benches are located in the game's town area where players spend their hours off the course. Dotting the blocky and sparsely detailed community are NPC vendors offering clubs, clothes, balls, gloves, shoes, a bank, and guild creation. The clothing options are dull, as many pieces look quite similar. It's possible to buy different colored balls for tinted flight streaks on the course, and better clubs with enhanced statistics. It's too bad the graphics weren't better, since the visual differences your purchases makes aren't all that interesting.    Though there is a guild system, it's not very exciting. By joining up, players get portions of their accumulated experience on the course siphoned into the guild. As the guild levels, more and more communication and administrative functions become available. What's confusing is many features you'd assume would be standard, like kicking people out, aren't available until you've leveled the guild a few times. Requiring players to sacrifice their own experience to acquire seemingly basic guild functionality makes leveling more of a hassle than an enjoyable process.     Once in an online lobby, players can choose a bunch of different modes like scratch, skins, match, and four-ball match. Pretty much everyone online is playing stroke, though. Getting good scores and hitting accurate shots nets you money and experience. By playing with higher level golfers on some of the harder courses, you'll get even bigger bonuses. Playing by yourself is pointless, since the money and experience yield is so low. The game basically forces you to play with other to make any progress, which leads to my biggest complaint: there's far too much downtime.   Ideally you want to end up in a four person match, since you get bigger bonuses. Unfortunately, you have to watch everyone else playing take their shots, which takes an incredibly long time. Even playing nine holes can take over an hour if you've got a slow party. Though it's understandable the game wanted to recreate a real golfing experience, I have a hard time seeing how spending 75 percent of gameplay doing absolutely nothing is entertaining. There really needs to be some way to get around the waiting times. Give players an option to simultaneously play through a hole. Have ghost models of opponents visible while playing so you can see their progress. Anything but make us watch each other take every shot.    The graphics won't impress anyone. Awkward, blocky character models populate sparsely detailed courses with at times strikingly low resolution textures. The shot animations are decent, however. In some cases the camera glitches out, preventing you from seeing where you're standing. Obviously that can cause some problems. Even the more fantastical courses are boring to look at.   Imagine yourself watching a particularly awful advertisement for a retirement community during the 1980s. Concentrate on the music playing. That's Shot-Online's soundtrack. Ambient sounds on the course are laughably repetitive and harshly unrealistic. The only reason your speakers should stay turned up in this game is for the beep that sounds when it's your turn to go. It's a good thing it's in there too, otherwise we never would have woken up to play.Though players may initially be obsessed with leveling as quickly as possible, that drive soon fades. As soon as leveling becomes an extended, lengthy process, the blandness of Shot-Online comes screaming to the surface. There are plenty of ways to customize your poorly drawn avatar, but none are particularly attractive. The game's got an online store for the lazier players to exchange real cash for items, but that doesn't make the game any better. The three click shot system works fine, but doesn't create any interesting swing possibilities. Though some may appreciate how the game forces players into groups to make any kind of substantial gains in experience and money, there's far too much downtime. While some may call it an opportunity for social interaction, I call it boring. Any game where reading a book, cooking a meal, and watching television are viable concurrent activities while playing is doing something wrong.", "date": "Sep 15, 2006"}
