Originally released by Taito in 1988, it was most notable for its zany premise: players control a kiwi bird named Tiki who must rescue his buddies from an evil walrus (is there any other kind?).  Tiki is armed with a bow and arrow and must make his way through a series of platform levels while spearing enemies, eating the fruit they leave behind, and utilizing several different methods of transportation.  The game is very cute and the old-school gamer in me really wants to like it, but there are too many annoying gameplay relics that should be left in the past.   New Zealand Story hasn't been given a modern makeover for Revolution.  If you know the arcade original you'll immediately recognize this DS version.  It looks dated, but there are plenty of gamers (myself included) who appreciate the classic look of a colorful, 2D platformer.  The same levels and bosses have been kept intact.  Each non-linear stage consists of a search for a key to release a friend, and then a search for your friend.  Environments are laid out horizontally and vertically, and wrap around themselves like a maze.  Action plays out on the top screen while the bottom displays the general location of important items.   The inventive boss battles are one of New Zealand's few major attractions. The challenge is in trying to navigate the dangerous environments (much of New Zealand is lined with spikes, apparently) and dealing with endlessly re-spawning enemies constantly getting in your way.  Really, I thought we had solved the problem of re-spawning bad guys back in 1990.  When a new foe pops up to take the place of anyone you slay it prevents the player from feeling a sense of accomplishment.  It doesn't feel like you're making progress.  Maybe the developers wanted to maintain an authentic New Zealand Story experience, but this was a chance to tweak the gameplay and make it more relevant to modern gamers.   The controls aren't very tight.  This means extra aggravation trying to make tricky jumps and avoid traps.  When the primary gameplay mechanic is to jump around, it had better be pretty fun to do so.  Here, it's more exasperating than anything else.   Since you're given an inexact location of the key and cage, it's easy to miss the key and have to backtrack.  But that means you have to deal with all the enemies again.  Some levels even prevent you from backtracking, so you're just stuck and have to call it a loss.  But you're forced to either kill yourself or turn off your system because you can't quit to the title screen while in a game, bizarrely enough.   There are brief moments where you'll need to use the stylus to open a door or catch Tiki from falling off a ledge.  A message appears on the bottom screen in these instances, but since your eyes are fixed on the top screen 99 percent of the time it's easy to miss these.  You will be expected to perform this mundane task while still dealing with any current enemies or obstacles.  Plus, I think it's bothersome to have to keep your stylus in hand for a game that doesn't use it most of the time.   The music is bouncy and playful, very well-suited to the gameplay.  Some of the sound effects are a little strange in that they don't seem to quite fit the action, but I've a feeling that was a choice by the developers to go along with the quirky feel of the game.New Zealand Story superfans will probably be pleased with this Revolution.  But how many superfans are out there?  If you never played the original you'll likely wonder why it warranted a remake.  And if you're a younger gamer who missed the arcade heyday this will probably just reaffirm your belief that games used to be pretty crappy.  I'm on board with New Zealand's graphics and sound, but there are too many games available these days to waste time dealing with enemy re-spawns and clunky platform controls.", "date": "Mar 6, 2008"}
