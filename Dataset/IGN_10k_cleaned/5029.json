Bandai Wireless weighs in this week with Magical Drop 2, a port of the hugely popular arcade puzzle series that has enjoyed many appearances on many platforms.   Features:   Challenging puzzle game  Match colors to clear screen   At first glance, Magical Drop 2 looks remarkably like Bust-A-Move. The concepts are certainly similar. The screen fills with colored ball, and you must clear them by matching three or more like colors. However, in Magical Drop 2 you must ~grab~ individual balls from the ceiling and then throw them back into a group of same colored balls to clear them away.   And that's it.   Such a simple game works well on handsets. The screen is small, but full of color. The controls are easy and effortless. There's even a little jingle that plays while you burst bubbles.If you're digging puzzlers, Magical Drop 2 is a natural fit. The game is simple at first, but as you clear screens the difficulty really ramps up. Several screens in, you'll find yourself addicted to the ~action.~ At least, I did. But, then again, I like puzzle games. Your mileage may vary.", "date": "Sep 25, 2004"}
