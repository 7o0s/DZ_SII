{"name": "Fighter Destiny 2", "name_review": "Fighter Destiny 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/06/20/fighter-destiny-2", "text": "When it was released in the US more than two years ago, the Imagineer developed Fighters Destiny 2 was a solid brawler for Nintendo 64. The fighting action, up close and person, could be likened more to the mechanics of today's wrestling games than it could to Capcom's Street Fighter franchise. It featured an original point system that allowed for reversals and throw-downs. And the visuals, for the time, were surprisingly well put together for a Nintendo 64 game.  Now comes Fighter Destiny 2 (publisher SouthPeak Interactive has dropped the 's' for copyright reasons), the sequel to Imagineer's original effort. This time around players can look forward to a few new characters to have a go with, new arenas, a training mode and a Mario-Party-like board mode by which new moves can be acquired. Unfortunately, what Nintendo 64 fighting fans can't look forward to in this sequel is an updated visual look over the aged original, a wealth of new characters and arenas, or an advanced fighting mechanic. In fact, there really isn't much that has changed in Fighter Destiny 2 and sadly the franchise's outdated style and sluggish feel is more noticeable than ever.  Features  Same engine and look as the original Fighters Destiny for N64 Five modes of gameplay Advance spaces on a board by defeating computer opponents, gathering new moves, skills and bonuses for each victory Training - Players hone their skills and learn how to fight 11 characters to choose from - plus five hidden bonus opponents - each with varied skills, strengths and stamina Each character has a unique personality and a large number of offensive, defensive, and special moves Adjustable scoring system, ring size and difficulty Two-player ready Rumble Pak support Save characters on Memory Pak Developed by Imagineer   Gameplay Fighter Destiny 2 plays identically to the original game. Battles take place atop raised square arenas and the objective is to either knock out or knock off opponents. The game utilizes a point system and depending on what route a player chooses, different amounts of points are awarded. For example, throwing an opponent out of the ring and onto the ground below results in one point and is generally only suggested if there are no other options. Meanwhile, reversals, which can be executed by pressing and A and B at the same time, award three points, and special moves dish out four. The system itself is, again, a perfect copy of the one utilized in Fighters Destiny so there are no real surprises here. With that said, it all works just as well as it did two and a half years ago.  On the same note, since the engine powering Fighter Destiny 2 is also unchanged the control mechanic -- characters move comparatively slow and sluggishly -- is also familiar. The D-Pad is serves to manipulate characters around the 3D arenas (though the analog stick can be configured) while A and B act as punch and kick, and L and R evade and crouch. Not exactly the deepest control scheme the fighting genre has ever witnessed, but it gets the job done. Players start out with only a few moves readily available to each character, but can unlock more by defeating various modes of gameplay. Nintendo 64 owners who have played the original Fighters Destiny will probably have trouble finding inspiration, though, as the fighting engine and new moves presented are so unimpressive now that it's difficult to stick with the title.  Basic Gameplay modes as follows:   Vs. Com: Your standard ~beat them all~ fighting mode. Vs. Battle: Just like last year's game. Whenever you win against another character, you acquire the fighting skills and strengths of the defeated opponent. You can save your favorite character to a Memory Pak and continue to build him or her up -- until your buddy kicks your butt so many times that your fighter is rendered powerless, and gets erased. Record Attack: In this mode, you can select from three different sub-modes: Survival Mode forces you to fight 100 battles in order to win (you can save anytime). Fastest Mode is like what Time Attack is to racing games. Try to beat your best records and save your initials and times to the Memory Pak.  And finally, the game's wackiest feature: Rodeo. Take on a strange cow character named Ushi (Japanese for cow) and try to survive as long as possible. Sugoroku: Roll the dice and your character moves on a 3D board, similar to Nintendo's Mario Party. Depending on what field you land, you'll have to battle with different fighters.  Training: Tell Robert the robot what you would like to learn, and he will show you. For example, if you want to practice blocking throws, he will continuously attack you with throws only. A handy, well-executed feature.   As you can see, the gameplay modes offered are relatively standard. Replay value is extended through design; the more fighters and modes successfully beaten, the more new moves and characters unlocked. The roulette mode featured in the original game has been replaced by Sugoroku, basically the same thing with a new interface; players progress through a Mario Party style board battling opponents until they face the Master, who, after bested, grants gamers a new move.   Character Information  Adriana - Brazil Adriana learned her skills dancing in the Brazilian Carnival.  She brings a colorful Samba dance style into the ring, converting flashy dance moves into punishing Judo techniques.  Opponents beware her special attack throws, ~You and I and the Burning Summer~ and ~Sun's Hug.~ The last thing they remember is beautiful dance.  Abdul - Mongolia Abdul comes from a long line of Mongolian Warriors dating back to the great Kubla Khan.  Don't underestimate him because of his rounded body shape.  He is skilled in strange and obscure moves developed in contemplation of Heaven, Hell and the creeping creatures on the Earth.  Among Abdul's strange powers are the ability to throw fireballs and a deadly head-butt or Reel called ~Trepang Heaven.~  Saeki -  Japan This young warrior seeks someday to be a Master.  One look at his upper body shows that he has dedicated himself to strength training.  He has also worked hard to develop quickness and agility.  In fact, many of his attacks, like ~Mach Hook,~ ~Mach Punch~ and the devastating special attack, ~Mach Buster ~are named after Mach 1, the speed of sound.  Federico - Italy This Scientific Genius has cooked up some deadly moves in his fight laboratory. In his research into inflicting pain he has developed an impressive catalog of punishing moves.  He takes his opponents to school with his ~Dragon Riser~ Knock Down skill and his electrical special skill, ~Plasma Heel Break.~  D- Dog - United States D- Dog is a funky-fresh Basketball Star who was banned from the sport for unnecessary roughness in the extreme.  His most vicious moves include the ~Blasphemy Chop,~ the ~Stomp~ and the dreaded ~Hammer Knuckle.~ D- Dog uses his height, speed and power to slam-dunk his opponents.  Ninja - Japan The Ninja warrior has dedicated his very soul to becoming human fighting machine.  Like any Ninja, he is cloaked in dark mystery and possessed of secret powers.  His Knock Down skills are the mysterious explosive ~Mine Palm~ and the powerful ~Tsumuji.~ By using the startling magic of ~The Art of Transform~ he can instantly switch positions with his opponent.  Ziege - Germany Part man, part machine, this hulking brute is a blue mountain of destructive power.  Ziege is not the quickest fighter, but his blows land with incredible force.  He enjoys pummeling his opponents into the Piyori State so he can give them a ride to dreamland with his ~Giant Swing~ Special technique.  Pierre - France Pierre loves to freak out his opponents.  He trained as circus tumbler, but he prefers making other people tumble.  He surprises his opponents with acrobatic spins, flips and somersaults and with crazy attacks.  Pierre's ~Transform ~ Technique (LL or ZZ) inflates his nose and increases his attack power.  If he uses ~Transform~ six times, his nose explodes and his power drops down to normal.  Dixon - Great Britain This British street punk doesn't need a reason to fight.  He just likes it. Anger is the energy behind his vicious Knock Down skills, ~I'm a Negative Creep~ and ~Angry Fist.~  His Special attack, ~Heal a Million, Kill a Million,~ is a merciless skull-cracking display of pure rage.  Meiling - China Meiling is a polite China girl who has crafted delicate skills of crushing power.  With the grace of a swan and the speed of a hummingbird, she teaches her opponents a lesson in good manners.  Meiling shows off her swiftness and grace with Knock Down skills like the beautiful ~Spiral Jump~ and the lightning-fast ~Tenkakuhosho.~  Kate - Great Britain Bored with the life of a super-model, Kate has taken to the ring with a Stunning style.  She mixes a mean cocktail blend of upper and lower attacks.  Try the ~Spinning Cocktail~ Counter technique or the ~Earth Cocktail~ Knock Down to give your opponent a permanent hangover.  Additional fighters appear throughout the game to challenge you.  You can earn the right to assume the identity of each of these special characters from the Character Select screen. But first you have to prove yourself worthy by completing certain difficult ordeals for each.  Mou Mou is a cool-headed milk-gulping cow who will test your endurance.  Cherry This trashy flashy fighter is no lady.  Master The Master oversees your development as a fighter.  Samurai The Samurai is a tough and ruthless fighter.  Fabien Fabien is a French Medieval knight with elegant fencing-style fighting techniques.  Several of the characters like Pierre and Ninja are regurgitated from the original game and feature the same characteristics and moves.  At the end of the day, the gameplay environment of Fighter Destiny 2 is so close to the original in design and feel that it's damn near hard to ascertain a difference. And two years ago that perhaps wouldn't have necessarily been a bad thing. After all, the game controls well enough, and offers up a number of unique features from a point system to raised battle environments, and all with a decent fluidity. But in the end it's all just a rehash of a two-year old game and in the year 2000 -- at the golden age of N64's life -- it feels positively ancient.  Graphics Were SouthPeak Interactive to set up a Pepsi Challenge-like comparison between Fighters Destiny and Fighter Destiny 2 we're confident that gamers would have difficulty trying to tell the difference. The visual look of the two games is extremely similar and first-generation to the very core -- a fact all the more noticeable by today's standards.  Character models are generally well designed, with a variety of body styles -- big and chunky to slim and short. Animation is fluid and varied, dishing out everything from spinning moves to flips, kicks, uppercuts and lock-up reversals with no trouble. And the background environments aren't too bad looking on occasion. That's the good. The bad, on the other hand, is that the polygon models are not soft-skinned and therefore overlap at the joints a la WWF Wrestlemania fame, the texturing and coloring patterns are often downright hideous, the backgrounds can be blurry and simple, and the framerate does take a hit now and again. Mortal Kombat 4, a game that has been available forever, looks significantly better in every respect and still moves with a blazing fast framerate.  Sound Yes, there is sound in this game. A standard selection of monotone grunts, thumps and crap crowd noises mixed with indifferent announcer commentary that spits out lines like, ~Fighters, take your positions.~ There is nothing particularly interesting going on here and therefore we won't waste your time by dwelling on it. Our strapline raised the question, ~Is Fighter Destiny 2 destined to take the spot for best N64 fighter?~ Sadly, the answer is an undeniable no. This sequel, while the extension of a solid fighter for its time -- two years ago -- can be summed up as too little and too late. Too little of an improvement and far too late in the life cycle of N64 to impress anybody with its simplistic, arguably shallow mechanics and positively boring graphic look. This is not to say that Fighter Destiny 2 won't provide starved fighting fans with some amusement during the long wait for Dolphin to finally deliver the goods. In fact, if the Nintendo 64 is the only system you own, this is one of the best fighters available to you (and that's really sad, by the way). But don't expect to be overly impressed by any single aspect of this mediocre effort in today's market.Worth a rental.", "date": "Jun 20, 2000"}
