If you have a little one nearby that is always reaching for your cellphone, Tom & Jerry: Food Fight is a good game to keep them occupied.   They get to play as little Jerry, who must use a cube of gelatin to bounce food out of the fridge and into his own private stash. Whiskers, the little white mouse, is standing at the top of the ice box, throwing out fruit, cheese, cookies, and other goodies for Jerry to juggle. The little guy seems to be blissfully unaware of Jerry's plight, because he just keeps on keepin' on.   The big trick to the game is that there are three bounces to get food into Jerry's basket, but not everything falls at the same rate. Bouncing slows things down, so it's not a matter of carrying one cherry across the screen. While carrying that cherry, Whiskers may throw out some cheese and a cookie. The cookie will tumble down quickly since it has not yet been bounced. So, With the cherry in the air, you have to bounce the cookie to slow it down, then get back under the cherry, then bounce the cheese as it falls, then back to the cookie, etc. For a kid's game, it can get kinda tough -- but a challenge is good.   There is a mini-game within the rather large mini-game where you take Whisker's position and start tossing the food yourself. There is a circle in the middle of the screen with two yellow zones. You have to press the ~OK~ button as a cursor enters the yellow zone to get the food out of the fridge and across the screen. As the cursor speeds up, this can get exceedingly frantic.   And if all this wasn't enough of a problem, mean ol' Tom shows up and throws bombs. At Jerry.  Tom & Jerry: Food Fight is just a simple, but smart, game aimed for younger players. I really liked the juggling mechanics, because even I had a problem keeping it all sorted out at later levels. And the Tom and Jerry sprites are expertly detailed -- kids will really enjoy that the characters are recognizable. While it's not exactly for the more traditional mobile gamer, Tom & Jerry: Food Fight is a good pick-up to hand off to younger players.", "date": "Sep 2, 2005"}
