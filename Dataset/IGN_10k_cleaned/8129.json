Its creators, veterans of the original EverQuest, hyped the game as the next generation in massively multiplayer online gaming. With Verant safely absorbed by Sony Online Entertainment, Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler established a new company and set out to come up with a more modern online game that built on the lessons learned from EQ and other MMOs, and based on a newer technology.   And it looks like McQuaid and company learned their lessons. Vanguard is, at least in the two weeks we've played it, a game built on experience and lessons learned and thoroughly enjoyable, with some caveats.   Starting Off    The biggest issue at this point remains the state of the game. Apparently Sigil wanted three more months to test it but they ran out of money in early January. Left with no choice but to ship the $49.99 game, they did. Well, Sigil should be back in milk and cookies now that the game has racked up 120,000 subscribers in its first month, despite its unfinished state.   As a result, there are some problems, most notably broken quests and plenty of other bugs. There are also performance issues. On my computer, a Core 2 Duo E6400 with 2GB of DDR2 RAM and an ATI Radeon X1800, it still gets clunky and jerky, while Half-Life 2 is smooth as glass. Considering the quality of the visuals, it shouldn't be as big a problem as it is.   That's due in part to the way it loads. Unlike EQ and more like World of Warcraft, there are no hard zone lines. This is nice because it eliminates the rude surprise of zoning in to an area and having a bunch of mobs on top of you, for the most part.  However, as you move into a new zone, it has to start loading zone information in the background, and this leads to some really bad pauses. Players refer to this as ~chunking.~ Thus far, that has been one the most aggravating aspects of the game. For the first two weeks after launch, Sigil was patching the game darn near daily, although that has slowed up recently.    On the good side, you can choose from 20 races from three groups. Thestrans are the oldest of races, and are made up of Dwarf, Lesser Giants, Vulmane, Halfling, High Elves and Varanjar. The Qualia is the home of the more villainous races, such as Qualiathari, Mordebi, Dark Elves, Varathari, Gnome and Kurashasa. Finally, there are the woodland creatures on Kojan, the Wood Elf, Half Elf, Raki, Orc, Goblin and Kojani.    From these races, you can choose from the following adventurers: Paladin, Warrior, Dreadknight, Shaman, Cleric, Blood Mage, Ranger, Bard, Monk, Rogue, Necromancer, Psionicist, Sorcerer and Druid. There was rumored to be a class called Inquisitor, a cross between the Psionicist (Enchanter) and Warrior that sounded intriguing but never made it to the final product.   One of the things I love about Vanguard is that races have clear strengths. High Elves, for example, will boost the mana pool of the members of their group and balance it out, so no one goes out of mana while others are full. Dwarves have the ability to turn their skin to stone, mitigating 25% of damage and increasing their poison resistance. Small races have a bonus to damage evasion while large races have a bonus to damage mitigation, and every race has a unique racial ability. All of this must go into deciding your race and class combination. Character creation is done in reverse order from EQ or WoW. You make your character first, and then pick your home server.     Progression   The early quests are very well balanced but nothing new. Kill X number of these creatures, loot X number of drops from mobs, and return to the quest giver. This will all sound very familiar to any MMO veteran. The quests make you cover a growing expanse of your home, and by the time you exhaust all of the quests, the last one you get sends you off to another region, where the cycle starts over.   The quests given are mostly for cash, but some are for gear. Some areas are better off than others. In building my wood elf ranger, I was given a number of quests that resulted in my ranger being reasonably armored by level 7. My psionicist has had no such luck. At level 9 he was still darn near naked. My dwarf paladin was given numerous lucrative quests that paid a fair amount of copper and silver, but again, the psionicist was given the short shrift. Paladin quests started out paying 60 copper, psionicist quests started out at 10 copper.    However, it cannot be denied that quests pay off in other big ways, namely, lots of experience. One of the ironies of EverQuest is that quests didn't give you diddlysquat for experience, but you could do them over and over again to make up for it. Vanguard, like WoW, won't let you do a quest again, but since you're given a decent reward for it at the start, there's little need.   As you move to new areas, you will find trainers in the area to teach you new skills. They are acquired similar to WoW, in that you are taught the skill rather than buying a scroll and memorizing it. What's nice is you learn your spells/skill from one source. One of the things that drove me insane in EQ was that spells for priests and casters were often spread over numerous vendors in different zones, and some of them were difficult to reach, if not impossible for certain classes.   Tradeskilling is a major part of the game. You get to pick a primary and secondary, and can harvest the materials while adventuring. This means chopping down trees or mining metals or skinning dead animals. I've seen some high-end player made gear and the stats are insane. In a nice touch, player made items have the name of the player that made them. This could be a good way for a master craftsman to earn a reputation.    On the down side, you also don't get much for the first ten levels. You get two new spells every even level. Still, they are often quite good, and you get at least one very powerful spell every four levels or so. As you level, you get adventure points to put toward your six attributes. In a nice touch, if you mouse over the attributes, it will show your current standing. For example, mouse over strength and it will tell you what kind of damage you do and your chances to land a critical hit. Under intelligence, it shows your spell damage and abilities to learn and recognize enemy spells.   Friends who have hit level 20+ say they haven't found high end raiding content yet. The fact people haven't hit level 50 in the first month of release is fine with me. I don't want the game to be too easy. The fact is, each individual level makes a notable difference. Even if it's an odd numbered level with no new spells, fighting the same creatures becomes a whole lot easier just making one level which isn't the case in some other MMOs.   Grouping   While you can solo effectively for a short while, eventually you will have to group. This isn't World of Warcraft where you can essentially solo to 60 with almost any class. Sigil makes you earn every level. The game moves along fairly quickly for the first 10 levels, and then you hit a wall. The fights become more difficult, especially for unprotected casters.   This basically makes grouping a necessity. The grouping experience is very different from EQ, and in many cases, gives you features that were normally available only at high levels with lots of alternative abilities. Your group members are listed on the upper left. First off, the icon on the left side tells you what classes you have. No more joining a group and saying ~What classes do we have,~ just look at the icons. It also has their levels.    Second, it shows not only your party members hit points but their mana and endurance. Also, on the right side is a small compass that points to where that person is in relation to you and their distance. The image in the upper right corner is the mob you are fighting, and the icons below its hit points are all of the dots and effects your party has cast on the mob. So you will see when your spell wears off.   Experience moves a little slower in groups, but you kill faster, so it comes out in the wash. Thus far I have not found many ~camps.~ There's no one place where five people sit and wait for a rare monster spawn. Every grouping experience I've had has been run and gun, killing as you go.    That's because the respawn rate is ridiculously fast. This cuts both ways. In one example, I had a quest where I had to retrieve six items from a dungeon. I found two boxes with the items and just went back and forth between the two because they respawned so fast. Likewise, a friend had to release six slaves in the same dungeon. We just went back and forth between two close spawns because once one was freed, another repopped almost immediately.   On the down side, that means no dawdling. You have to keep moving or mobs will respawn right on top of you, and if you are fighting that means trouble. Vanguard does have a nifty feature in that the list of mobs hitting you scroll down the right side of your screen, opposite where your group list would be. If you get trained, well, that list can be pretty long.   When you die, you respawn at the nearest shrine where you're presented with three options. You can be resurrected by a cleric, run back and get your corpse, or summon at the altar. If you run back, you'll get some experience back. If you summon, you get none of your experience back. It's up to you to decide when it's best to run to the corpse and when you should just summon.    From a visual standpoint Vanguard stands pretty mixed. Player character and style in general is pretty uninspired. Sigil was going for the look of an oil painting and in some cases came close with mountain ranges, but it other cases, it's bland, including most architecture. Textures in general are pretty weak compared to many games today leaving even more question about performance issues. It's not that the game is ugly, it's just not as beautiful as it should be given the requirements to play the game at higher settings.    It's funny because one of the huge bonuses this game provides to many players that like to explore is that this world is monstrous. It takes a long time to cross portions of it which is why mounts are available so early and both flying mounts and boats are available later in the game. Thestrans, Qualians, and Kojans all have their own continent and each is gigantic. What's good about this is that in some cases, the vistas provided by elevated plateaus can be pretty stunning. There are certainly some lovely areas in the game that deserve recognition, but all told, the final visual package is decent, but never spectacular. While the game looks better in motion than it does in the screens, they're a fair representation of the game world.   Sound is not a strong point either. The atmospheric music is very anemic and tepid. Most of it is just synthesizers. Combat sounds are also primitive crunching, grunting, and occasional reactions from the monster. Quest characters greet you with a basic greeting and say next to nothing when you leave. Once again, it's not bad, but there could have been more.Sigil hasn't shaken up the MMO experience. It's an evolutionary game, from what I've seen. The fact that it's a bit early out of the gate has caused it to have a number of launch issues, most of which are fairly common to the genre. The slower progression, group focus and huge world all set the game apart from the current MMO behemoth, World of Warcraft. Whether those differences are positive or negative is largely a matter of taste. For now, it's a nice evolution, learning from the smart decisions and mistakes of the MMOs that came before it. Once all of the bugs and other issues get hammered out, Vanguard could end up being a loveable game.", "date": "Feb 27, 2007"}
