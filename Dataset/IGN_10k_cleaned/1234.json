With Micro Machine's fast action, smooth animation, and tight gameplay, it's hard to see that anyone can do this style better than what THQ has offered. But that certainly doesn't stop companies from trying -- Metro3D takes its existing Dreamcast namesake Armada and expands it into a overhead racing game for the portable. But here's the difference -- his game's terrible. Features Six alien races and tracks Differing alien terrain Hidden Survival Mode Battery save Only for Game Boy Color   It's not that Metro's a bad developer -- they've already produced three high-quality games for the Game Boy Color in the form of Bubble Bobble Classic, Chase HQ (both developed by Taito), and Puzzle Master (the company's only internally developed game prior to this one).  But something went seriously wrong with Armada F/X Racers, because it looks and feels like an amateur production.  The game is based on the universe that was created for the Dreamcast in the form of Armada. All the alien races are portrayed from that game as vehicle drivers in Armada F/X racers. But that's the only thing this game has in common with that decent shooter. That game is fun and maniacal. This racer is just downright annoying and irritating to play and watch.  Since it's a top-down racer, it takes advantage of the layout by allowing 360 degree driving (meaning you can maneuver in any direction). But the artists failed to render the car in multiple positions -- this gives the animation a very chunky look when you watch your car turn clockwise and snap into position in, at most, eight locations. And even though the car might be moving in a direction, it's not portrayed that way graphically -- it could be facing straight upwards and moving in a diagonal direction. On top of this, the scrolling engine is very choppy -- only regaining its framerate in the Boss battles when the track has two cars on it.  Graphics aside, even the gameplay feels rushed -- it's not really the most imaginative design in the world, but some of the original elements are a little on the annoying side. Not only do you have to race three other vehicles on the track, but you have to avoid pace ~tornadoes~ (I'd call them by their real name, but the paltry manual doesn't even mention them) that get in your way. These tornadoes don't need to be in there simply because it's a challenge just trying to work the track without smacking into off-track obstacles that slow you to a halt most of the time. The camera also focuses more on the backside of the track instead of what's ahead of you, making the track predictions a lot more difficult.   And speaking of the manual, the damage and power-up portions aren't even mentioned -- I figured out the further along you go without slowing down, the more the power gauge increases, and when it fills your car flashes. But why? Faster speed? Stronger armor? I'm not sure. It's obvious that the more damage you take, the worse off you are until you explode -- but don't you think this is an important thing to mention in the manual?  And do me a favor -- if you do play this game, turn the speakers down. Every turn you take you'll hear the same digitized ~tire squeal~ sample that'll drive you bonkers within the first race.  Sorry folks, but Armada F/X Racers is one of the worst top-down racing games I've played on the Game Boy Color (or any system for that matter). There's not a single element here worth playing the game for -- if you need an overhead fix, you really need to go out and pick up Micro Machines. Blast this one into orbit.", "date": "Sep 12, 2000"}
