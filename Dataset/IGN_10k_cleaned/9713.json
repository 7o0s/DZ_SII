With each ill-timed bounce, the robot flies apart until nothing is left but a tin head, rolling until it reaches rest. And after you're done smiling at this goofball android, you set it up and start allover again, see how the robot fares on the next slope.   It's this kind of singular idea that Digital Chocolate knows how to execute, and Kamikaze Robots serves as yet another reminder that these good people really know how to make excellent mobile games.   The game builds on the very basics of the publisher's greatest game to date -- Tornado Mania -- which remains my absolute favorite mobile title yet created. (I even booted it up this morning to again verify the tenacity of such a claim. Mission accomplished.) You use a lone button to help rotate a robot as it rattles down rugged, jagged ramps so that its feet always touch down at the end of each bounce. As long as the robot lands on its feet, it bounces back into the air en route to the finish line at the bottom of the slope. If you miss a landing, the robot takes major damage and eventually starts losing limbs. Should the robot incur too many boo-boos, it falls apart and you're forced to start the roll again.   Unless...   You can exercise a desperation move close to the bottom of the mountain. By purposefully smashing a limbless robot into the ground with its head pointed toward the finish line, you can send that skull flying over the goal to eek out a last-ditch victory.   There are 29 ramps to conquer and if the game was only about making a robot land on its feet, Kamikaze Robots would lose its charm around level ten. The ever-changing ramps, certainly keep things interesting. There is also a racing element to the game, as there are a handful of other self-flagellating machines bounding down the mountainside behind you. (They appear as shadows, an effect that looks great.)   You also earn chips while racing by completing certain goals beyond just finishing in first place, such as nailing a specific bounce height. Each stage in the tournament has four chips. Between stages, you cash these chips at an upgrade room. Customize your robot by increasing its different skills via earned points. You can adjust your robot's spin, the amount of damage it can take before it rattles apart, its jumping skills, and the force behind the explosion that sends its head flying. These upgrades really affect performance, so if you are struggling with a particular race, go back to previous races and try to bank all of the chips.   Kamikaze Robots is a cute little game, thanks to the big-eyed hero you're putting through so much pain. The robots bounce about colorful levels depending on the power of your handset. The music in Kamikaze Robots is a true standout feature, too. The themes in the game are fantastic -- they perfectly match the game's silly spirit.Kamikaze Robots is a smart mash-up of Tornado Mania and Johnny Crash, one of Digital Chocolate's earlier games. The simple, one-button controls are an excellent gateway to a game that becomes surprisingly engrossing as you dig deeper. When DChoc nails a concept, they are practically unequalled, and Kamikaze Robots is just one of those successes. If you're looking for a great casual game that doesn't involve gems, blocks, or cards, say hello to these robots.", "date": "Dec 7, 2007"}
