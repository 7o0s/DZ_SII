Some are a little pixelly, some are a little framey, but so far, they're all fast and intense, and much more impressive than you ever expected them to be. The opening salvo is Backtrack, and the fast-paced game already proves that the genre is prefectly viable on the little handheld. But with all of these FPSes coming within a few weeks of each other, the real question isn't who's first or who pulls off the most novelty tricks -- they'll all bicker and battle about who can do textured ceilings and floors, which has the fastest framerate, which can do dynamic lighting, who has real transparencies or just dithered graphics, etc. As long as we see performance of at least this level, the bottom line is going to be really simple -- is the game a good game?   Features Twelve levels Nine weapons Link cable support for multiplayer action Only for Game Boy Advance  So, is Backtrack a good game? It certainly is very playable. The fast-paced gameplay is exactly what you demand from a shooter, and the GBA keeps clip well. Easy controls keep it simple and direct -- Quake'ers and even Doom-mongers may be looking for the controls to duck, jump, or aim up and down, but by keeping it to the basics, the focus is on running and gunning. It's a shooter much more in the vein of Castle Wolfenstein, and in many ways, the basics are all this genre needs. You need bullets, and you need enemies to sink them into.  As far as the graphics engine, it's got its stumblings, but it mostly manages to keep running. Not that it needs comparing to the competition, but for stat trackers, it does push textured floors (but no ceilings) and it runs somewhere in the middle of the competition as far as consistent framerate and game speed. The bummer of the engine is that the draw distance is far too shallow, giving only a few feet before the background fades into nothing. However, enemies do draw in a little farther than walls, and can be seen at enough distance that you can fight them from afar without shrouds of fog destroying the game (there's a cheat for pros where enemies can get caught in the draw fog before they can shoot back -- not exactly what the programmers want to be said about the game engine, but it's only a slight quibble, it works out for the player, and it's a mistake-in-your-favor that may be hearken back to yesteryear for old-school gamers).   It should also be noted that the engine is a solid performer. It's not boasting the best framerate of the GBA shooters, but nothing can stop it when it's running. Pile enemies in a room, scatter bullets and power-ups behind them, and the game will still keep pace. I did see it hitch at least once, but the difference was basically nothing, with a smattering of scrapped robots catching the game engine just slightly. Basically, except for the draw distance and lack of ceilings (which you hardly notice are missing on GBA), the game engine doesn't cause the game any real problems. The GBA is ready for shooters.  Sounds good this far. So, are there any problems with the game. Just one, and it's a biggie. The problem with Backtrack is Backtrack. The game you see on the GBA was originally a sad-sack effort on the PC that failed to overwhelm with very little to offer. And now it's on GBA. Granted, the littler system brings smaller expectations, but I've played the PC effort, and it's so bad that the draw distance on a modern PC is just as bad as this little Game Boy. This wasn't the best of games to start with for a GBA project. The very best they could hope for was port that didn't chug, and that's all they got.  Looking at the GBA version on its own, the game is enjoyable for its intensity, but hardly much else. Its essentially the least ambitious of the GBA shooters (or first-person shooters in general), being based more off the elementary Wolfenstein design of square blocks for stages and simple flat stages. That's incredibly limiting for the game, as it's all big blocky worlds of right angles. The designers did the best they could with it all -- there's even a cleverly laid out stage that reveals itself on the map to be skull-shaped -- but there was only so far they could take it. Surprisingly, the game designers didn't take advantage of the smooth game engine to fill it with sprites of tables, chairs, flags, or other landmarks that would have filled up rooms and given them purpose -- instead, it's just corridor after corridor to splatter replicants in.  How bad is the game design? Think about this -- the storyline is the very last thing anybody cares about in a shooter, and yet even the storytelling gets in the way. There's this inane sense of ~humor~ that tries to sully into the thick of battle, and it just doesn't work. When Jim Track picks up a Bubble Gun (that needs Bubble Gum to fire) on his journey to eradicate the evil forces from the ashes of project BSBODSOM (Build Secret Base On Dark Side Of Moon), it's kind of stupid. When you start battling baddies with a Vacuum Cleaner, it's a little stupider. When you need Vacuum Powder to fuel the Vacuum, it's just dumb. There's a bunch of bad Looney Tunes jokes tacked on to the game, but for other portions, the game is so dead-serious it's boring. The atmosphere just never works. Some games get away with the sly sense of humor in the middle of carnage, but the degree that it's in here is groan-worthy.   It's frustrating the number of bad decisions that went into this game. For instance, while I've said a few times that the control is good, that's mainly because shooters are fun to play -- the actual control of Backtrack has a glaring flaw that some guns take whole seconds to fire (and fires long after you let your hands off the button, discharging rounds without another button pressed even after reload sequences). A few guns, you can understand it from the gun design, and a few others, you can adjust to, but you shouldn't have to adjust. The bad gun timing also opens you up to all kinds of cheap hits that would be manageable by strafing if the guns could be counted on while strafing, which of course they can't. If I pull the trigger, I expect the gun to go off. Also frustrating is the level/puzzle design. Hidden secret walls, which should be the path to bonuses (at least early on) instead become the main ~puzzles~ of the game by the second floor, completely without indication that the game's engine can even handle secret moving walls, much less where to find them (except for the few that are slightly off-color, but the game's lighting and draw-in problems make them seem ordinary). There are some great elevator/drop floor puzzles at the very end, but there's not nearly enough of those, and far too many necessary secret walls. By the game's end, you'll be crawling every wall in a stage searching for that one hidden stone that'll lead elsewhere. You spend just as much time facing the walls as you do facing baddies. Just no fun.  The Single Player structure is almost more like a Survival Horror game than a FPS, since the whole game is just one big world. Resources are sometimes scarce, and the stages are scattered, so remembering where the nearest health kit is in the world may be impossible. With the bad save structure, that can be a big problem -- there are no general 'recharging stations', and your health isn't restored in between stages because it's all one big stage. You can put yourself in a bad state if you save at the wrong time, blowing all the progress you've made so far. One stage even had a password puzzle where a dying man tells you the codeword -- forget the password or lose the paper you wrote it down on, and you'll have to play the whole game through again to meet the dying man a second time once you've saved after his death. The designers even recognizes that this would be a problem and tried to get around it with the  Temporary Save -- you can save without actually saving over your game save, then, once you know for sure that you won't be totally #&@%'ed if you save, save to the real save. The Temp Save doesn't actually save, of course, it just saves your progress only while the game system is on. Thank the Lloyd the game doesn't have a Hot Save...Shareware efforts at full price? Not something I'm looking forward to in GBA's future. Aside from the spooky sound voices whispering ~Join us...~, production values are pretty low throughout Backtrack. From the minute you see the cheesy menus, you get a feeling of dread that this game isn't going to live up to its effects. And with a cheesy story and cheesy design leave that feeling hovering all through the game. Even Multiplayer, which usually heats up a game, is only mild here. The delay of the guns kills some of the fun, the inability to tune the difficulty of the bots makes more disappointment, and the bad character design gets in the way too (the ninny who thought it would be fun to limit the ammo in a Deathmatch should be put in a cage with the goober who figured a sword would be a great weapon and forced to fight to the death, or at least they get the idea of what's fun in a Deathmatch.) But it's really just the mindless gameplay and lack of options or complications in battle that make the Multiplayer no fun. Backtrack is a mess of those kinds of design flaws. It still manages to be a slightly enjoyable romp because the fundamentals of shooting are fun. Never mind that there are a whole slew of others coming just like Backtrack, because from what I've seen and played, they all have different qualities and styles. You could conceivably want them all, and if Backtrack had the right stuff from the beginning, it'd be worth having too. But they rushed it to be first, and they never had the backing game to make it memorable as the one to set that landmark. In the hurry to become the answer to the trivia question of which was the GBA's first shooter, they made a trivial game.", "date": "Nov 2, 2001"}
