Bam! Entertainment attempts to one-up Majesco's car combat game with a more dedicated stunt driver of their own.  Chase: Hollywood Stunt Driver puts you in the skin of sexy Chase Corrada, stunt woman extraordinaire.  Race around five different movie sets, each broken into four separate scenes.  Complete a variety of goals as you progress further into the game.  And, if you're fortunate, have fun doing it.  Only Chase can pull off these crazy stunts and make the perfect action scene.  Features A variety of different vehicles to drive including dune buggies and motorcycles Pull off crazy stunts to wow the audience Watch replays of your best runs in the Replay Theatre Take on up to three friends in Multiplayer mode 4.0 Surround Sound  Gameplay Chase's main mode of play is the Career Mode, where you'll have to work through almost two-dozen scenes.  Each scene has you driving a different vehicle (though the controls for each remain the same) and completing different objectives.  At first, there will only be a few objectives, but after the first movie set, which is there to get you familiar with the game, there will be around ten objectives for each scene.  The objectives are always similar and include things like picking up every slate icon in the scene, destroying a certain amount of objects, or pulling off a particular stunt.  You rarely can clear all objectives in one run, so you'll need to replay each scene several times.  The objectives are a bit too easy.  Some, like doing a 20-meter power slide are made even easier by the game's odd convention.  You don't have to do a single 20-meter power slide, which would have made sense and been a challenge, but instead must simple do enough power slides to total 20-meters in distance.  So if you do one 10-meter slide and three 4-meter slides later, you still complete the objective.  Hard to do?  Nope.  In fact, many of the objectives you do without even trying.  The game isn't so much about challenging gamers as it is forcing them to run through the same level several times.  Nothing in the game makes you go ~that's impossible, it'll take me forever to do that.~  A few runs through any scene will have you looking like a pro.  Though you are a stunt driver, you don't necessarily do many stunts.  There are ramps to jump in every level and things to crash into, but stunts themselves come in only a few varieties.  There are ground stunts and air stunts and both are pulled off with the X button.  In four-wheeled cars, driving on two wheels requires you hold down the X button once you're going at least 38 kph.  You can't steer while propped up, which makes it a tough challenge except on long straightaways.  It also makes it less enjoyable.  In a motorcycle, you can do a wheelie in the same way, but again, you can't turn.  Air tricks are also pulled with the X button.  Press left, right, up, or down to do a flip or a 360 spin.  And thus ends the fascinating tricks.  Limited?  Yes.  And that hurts Chase, because it really needs a bit more complexity to make it worthwhile.  On the plus side, each vehicle handles differently.  It's a bit exaggerated (or perhaps too realistic) so it's sometimes a pain to control.  So many times while playing I had memories of Wreckless and Chase made me appreciate Activision's smash-up even more.  The controls are stubborn and the action is too slow, with the environments too plain.  There's not enough happening and in almost every level you are essentially on rails, so that lack of spontaneity in the environment makes the game get stale rather fast.  Don't lose the Ramen!  The levels have some decent variety.  You'll drive through suburbia, the mall, and the docks among other places.  But the levels still manage to feel the same.  There's plenty to bash into and jump over, but (with a few exceptions) the levels seem identical minus different skins.  That's not to say the routes are identical, but there's an immediate ~been there, done that~ feel to just about every level.  In order to progress through the game, you'll need to earn reputation points by completing the tasks in each level.  Often this means you'll have to complete almost every objective before moving to the next scene.  You can go back and retry any scene at any time to pass new objectives, or if you just feel like racing that train again.  Outside of Career Mode, Chase offers a Challenge Mode, Multiplayer, and a Replay Theatre.  The Challenge Mode comes with only three different games.  The first, which is open from the start of the game, is just a bus hop.  Granted, there is a moving ramp and giant balls swinging around, but it's not terribly thrilling.  All it requires it timing your run and you'll jump buses till the cows come home.  The other two can be unlocked through superior gameplay and offer more of a challenge.  You'll come here and play these once you've beaten the game, and after spending a few minutes with them, the game will likely be placed nicely in a drawer somewhere and forgotten about.  Multiplayer isn't worth the time.  It just seems poorly planned.  For example, one of the three games involves playing tag.  One person is it and they do their best to tag the other.  Up to four people can play at once on split-screen using any of the unlocked vehicles.  Problem is, the arena, filled with loop-the-loops and ramps, is way too big.  It's hard to run anyone down and with no radar.  It's sometimes hard to even know which direction to go in.  Worse yet, there's no point to the game.  You can set it for 1-5 minutes, but it doesn't track how long someone is It.  So, when time's up, there is no winner.  It just ends and asks if you'd like to play again.  Answer: No thanks.    Graphics While not an ugly game, Chase lacks the Xbox punch.  Spared from a lot of jaggies and aliasing problems, the game has some pretty poor textures and the framerate drops now and then.  The effects are more PS2 than Xbox as well.  Bam! tries to cheat a few effects like light trails from tail lights, but it just doesn't work.  Some scenes, driving around smashing into things, I was homesick for the beauty of Wreckless.  Sure, graphics aren't everything, except when it comes to the graphics section of a review.  The replays are really poor, which is what hurts the game more than anything else.  What makes Stuntman for PS2 so cool is that the replays of the scene look great.  Here, though, the camera angles are pedantic and you truly see how empty the backgrounds are.  And the close-ups of Chase show her looking less human and more like a blow-up doll (not that I know what one of those looks like).  Passable graphics, but certainly nothing special on the X.  Sound The 4-channel surround isn't bad.  It's actually done properly, at least, with cars chasing you coming from the rear speakers.  But the sound effects themselves are really toned down.  Explosions should rock the room, but they barely peak above the sound of other car engines.  The lack of 5.1 makes this, yet again, feel like something that could have (or should have) been done on another system.  Whenever people scatter as you approach, you hear the same shrill scream.  It's incredibly annoying and obnoxious.  Even the guys scream like that.  It's not like IGNCube editor Fran Mirabella III is out there in traffic.  Oy.  So life-like. Chase lacks ingenuity, vive, and excitement.  There are no tense moments, no times where you will throw down your controller over the difficulty of a situation, and no real reason to play it all the way through.  It lacks passion.  I can't say I had fun playing the game, but for some reason I kept playing.  Maybe it was just to see if it would get better.  Probably because it wasn't a terrrible game and it was hard to believe how lifeless it felt.  Chase might be a rental, but certainly isn't worth the price of admission.  With so many games coming this Holiday, save your $50 for a more worthy offering.", "date": "Sep 12, 2002"}
