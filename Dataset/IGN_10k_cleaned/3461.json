Not only has 3DO already released the aging but valiant High Heat Baseball 2004 to a legion of adoring fans, but Sony, Sega, and Electronic Arts are fast on its heels with excellent offerings of their own. The next contender in a year of hardball greatness, however, is Acclaim Austin's returning favorite All-Star Baseball 2004. And while it's possible that this version could boast the most features of any title in the category this season, it shares quite a few threads with High Heat in the fact that it's beginning to reveal some geriatrics (though in an entirely different light than Double H).   That doesn't mean that All-Star is remiss of the terrific qualities that's been associated with it for the last several years. In fact, this is the biggest edition of ASB in the history of the franchise so far, and returning patrons will most likely break into conniptions because of it. Improved in just about every aspect, the game is definitely enough to power the Austin-based development crew to several high-fives and mutually congratulatory conversations. But with the baseball market such a rough customer this year will it be enough to claim victory over its competitors?   To make matters even more clouded is the fact that there's been plenty of skepticism surrounding the PlayStation 2 version of the game in particular. A victim of several bugs and frame rate issues in comparison to its GameCube and Xbox counterparts, the PS2 offering of High Heat forced several of our IGN's readers into a state of paranoia. Would All-Star Baseball 2004 fall victim to the same fate?   Features  In terms of bonuses, ASB 2004 has all the typical amenities that one would expect in today's age of realistic sports sims. Exhibition matches and home run derbies have made the cut as they do every year and the player cards that were so popular in last year's edition have made a comeback too. Earned by fulfilling predetermined challenges and performing well in any given contest, the points needed to buy player cards range in difficulty from routine (retire the side) to nigh-impossible (throw a perfect game). However well you perform, there's always an incentive to do well no matter which game you're participating in; as the results could earn you the extra cards you've been waiting for.    Another new edition this year is what's called the Pickup Game. Taking place on a schoolyard baseball diamond, Pickup randomly generates a pool of players before every match. Once the players have been determined, gamers can select their team members in a round-robin draft until everyone has been picked for both sides. It's a pretty cool little option that adds an extra spin on the typical exhibition match, and it shows an admirable thread of creativity. Once on the field, the rules aren't any different from a regular game with the exception of the attire that each character is wearing. Clad in denim jeans and sweaty tee shirts, the schoolyard contest is very much like the weekend competitions that real-life friends have been enjoying together for over a hundred years.   There are other cool additions worth mentioning as well. The scenario mode, for instance, allows you to relive or alter famous situations from 2002 (recreated exactly as they happened) while the Multimedia section provides interviews with cover boy Derek Jeter, Cal Ripken Jr., and our personal favorite, the legendary Buck O'Neil. A terrific source for stories and opinions, the Multimedia department is an awesome time waster and one of the better features on the disc. Remaining extras like the panoramic stadium tour, beginner's tutorial, and specialized rosters based on legendary Hall of Famers and Negro League All-Stars do nothing but add extra points. There's even an option to download the latest lineups and player transactions via the Broadband Adapter.    Of course, the real star in the features category is the elaborate Franchise option. Expanded upon from last year, the new version of franchise has just about everything you could imagine. Not only can you sign free agents, release players, or develop them in a make believe minor league system, you can also create your very own expansion team as well! Selectable from a pre-created list of major cities and areas (in addition to a list of pre-made team names and mascots), gamers can assemble their own team from the ground up. You can even select the stadium they play in and hold an expansion draft before the start of the season.   Unfortunately navigating your way through a typical season isn't as easy as it should be. Lost in a sea of menus and a poorly constructed interface, making your team's decisions can become a greater exercise than the ballgame itself. As cool as the old-style theme may be it should have been streamlined to allow for faster navigation and more immediate results (there are tons of pauses between screen transitions). Bothersome as that may be, it's hard not to appreciate the remaining elements that franchise has to offer; A full Spring Training Schedule, All-Star festivities, an amateur draft, and the ability to pick up players through waivers are but a few of the added elements that nab points for realism. You can even have arbitration hearings at the end of the season or allot more budget points to different coaching categories to shape your team.   Strangely though, the game still tells you about a lack of space on the memory card for game data even if you've already saved your data to it and have nothing else on the card. This was a bizarre quirk in last year's version as well, and one that doesn't seem to want to go away.    Gameplay  All-Star Baseball tries really hard to appeal to as many markets as possible. Feature-trove notwithstanding, ASB offers four different types of batter interfaces for different levels of players. Unlike other games in the genre, though, ASB's four different styles actually change the type of game you'll experience and can mean the difference between a good baseball engine and a poor one. The easy setting, for example, was most obviously created for beginners and fans of the 8-bit school of doing things; requiring the player to do nothing other than time the swing of their bat with the arrival of an incoming pitch. Unfortunately this simple mode of attack provides little excitement and more frequent bouts of pop-ups and fly-outs than other options.   Zone batting on the other hand, borrows from the philosophy from the oft mentioned High Heat 2004 and expands beyond the usual timing issue with the addition of directional pushes. If a pitcher throws you a fastball low and inside, press the analog stick to the lower left for maximum effectiveness. A curveball high and outside means you'll need to push up and right and so on. You can, however, push different directions than the location of the pitch -- it's a way to alter the type of hit you can pull off. Though it's not as effective here as it is some of the other modes.   The classic option is a little more advanced and presents you with a cursor that can be used as a targeting device. The closer towards the center of the target, the more accurate and powerful your shot will become; Surprisingly, this particular system seems to work in the most realistic manner of all the selections, and while it isn't as advanced as the fourth and final ~normal~ setting, the level of interactivity and adjustability of the swing is perfect when matched up against CPU pitching. Of course, you can always go with the default ~normal~ selection and have the added option to tilt the direction of your swing, but with the frequency of change-ups and curveballs that CPU opponents throw, adjusting your swing with the junk pitches in this mode isn't very intuitive. Regardless of which style you choose, though, hitting is definitely All-Star's best gameplay attribute.    Not so lucky is the remedial pitching engine. Boasting a standard setup that emulates most of yesterday's popular baseball games, ASB doesn't offer much in terms of pitching options. This year's edition of High Heat far eclipses as far as pitching selection goes and reacts more realistically to the throws you select. One edge that All-Star has over every other baseball game, however, is that it's actually possible to strike out CPU batters (a rarity in console games on any system). Come to think of it, you can draw walks when at the plate as well; and it's a good thing too; because the game's most obvious problem is found when out in the field and rounding the bases.   In terms of priority the game's defensive players are probably our biggest nitpick. Incredibly fast in the infield yet unbelievably slow in the outs, it never truly feels as though you're in control of your team; there are plenty of instances per session that see your fielders giving up outfield singles that should have easily been caught. The reason this happens is because the moment a ball is hit towards the outfield, the Dual Shock turns stupid with a one-second delay after you've given your character their command. The lack of a turbo button hurts the fielding too; especially since the ball physics are so accurate (meaning that the speed and bounce of the ball zip along faster than your character can get to them). To make things even more embarrassing, the CPU controlled fielders are super quick, and seeming catch every ball hit to them -- not to mention the fact that they can gun you out from anywhere on the field. Good luck getting doubles or triples in this one.   When playing in the infield, the opposite reactions ring true. Fielders zip around the diamond like nobody's business and seem to move at two to three times the speed of the guys in the outer positions. Meanwhile, the opposing team's runners sluggishly trot from base to base and, much like the outfield defensive players, react a split second after you command them to advance or return to a base.    For the most part, these defensive issues and Baserunning problems don't happen frequently enough to warrant uproar. On the other hand, they're definitely common enough to detract from the over all experience. What ASB really needs is an overhaul of its priorities: Speed up the reaction/adjustment time on the bats, slow down the speed of incoming pitches, and rethink the abilities of the outfielders. Too bad you can't alter these attributes via a slider bar: would have been extremely helpful.   Graphics  An anomaly if there ever was one, All-Star Baseball's visual presentation is the perfect example of hit and miss. The character faces, for instance, are terrific; and minute little details like Barry Bonds' dangling earring or Mike Piazza's quasi-mullet are all part of their personalities as they step up to the plate. Other character-specific touches like varying body types, signature batting stances, and limb-accurate body armor go a long way in convincing us that Acclaim went that extra mile towards making their game as realistic as possible.   But then you have the dark side of character models and the robotic way in which they walk and move. Silky smooth during throw animations, the rest of the player's movements are as stiff as they are small. Diminutive in comparison to every other game on the market this year, the smaller players also lack the pizzazz we'd hoped they'd have after last year's somewhat bare bones detail, and are entirely too slow when navigating the outfield.    And yet, the uniforms themselves look terrific  --especially when viewed in the batter's box. Varied and accurate, they sport all the proper team insignias and marks while trying to boast as many shadows and other tricks as it can muster. Unfortunately, the low-res quality of the visuals give everything a somewhat muddy appearance and make it difficult to appreciate ASB's visual plusses. At leas the stadiums are accurate and there's plenty of crowd-specific wardrobe to liven things up.   Sound  Acclaim definitely went all out as far as licensed music is concerned; nabbing the theme song from the classic Robert Redford movie The Natural the soundtrack to ASB 2004 oozes the spirit of baseball from the moment you plug it in. Other well known tracks (like Smash Mouth's poppy ~All-Star~ and House of Pain's old-school ~Jump Around~) accompany players as they walk to the plate, and the 40-plus organ tunes add a lot to the game's overall presentation.   Not so impressive is the commentary by Thom Brennamen and Steve Lyons. Stand-up guys and quality announcers in real life, their commentary doesn't flow very well in comparison to other baseball games. The problem lies in the fact that all of their voice clips are spliced together in a way that doesn't sound very natural. So while other titles like World Series 2K3 and EA's MVP appear to have actual conversations taking place between its broadcast crew, the squad in ASB comes across as forced and mechanical. We'll admit that the player recognition for created characters and Spanish announce option is a nice touch though.   The rest of the audio falls in around the slightly above average mark. Sound effects do a good enough job and the occasional cat calling from the crowd is pretty neat, but there's nothing in this area that truly stands out. It was also pretty disappointing to learn that forward thinking technology like Dolby Pro Logic wasn't used to enhance the experience (though there is rather standard surround sound support).With five PS2 baseball games headed for the stores this year, the big question on everyone's mind is ~which one should I run out and buy?~ Unfortunately, the answer isn't as clear as it's been for the last couple of years. The truth is that there's such an abundance of great features and gameplay options in every title, that it makes it difficult to pick just one. Does All-Star Baseball 2004 do the best job of capturing all the elements? No; probably not.What ASB does have though, is six hundred pounds of appeal for franchise and stat junkies. A running hall of fame, new stadiums for your team if you do well enough to earn them, and tons of other subtleties guarantee returning fans nothing but good times. It's just too bad that ASB trails behind in terms of fielding and baserunning, as it has some of the best batting options around. All in all, Acclaim Austin's latest is a solid, if not flawed exercise in diamond mechanics.", "date": "Feb 27, 2003"}
