BatttleTanx has been moved from N64 to PlayStation, and now to the Game Boy Color. And while it's fun to blow stuff up in this version, the game feels just as hollow as the hundreds of buildings you have to destroy in it.FeaturesFifteen missions Five locations Password Save Only for Game Boy Color~The year is 2001. The United States has fallen into chaos from...~  Blah, blah, blah. All you really need to know is that you've got some butt-kicking to do, and you've got powerful tanks to do said butt-kicking. BattleTanx's levels are broken into scenarios where you have to do one of four different things: destroy all the enemy tanks, collect all the coins, reach point B from Point A, or a capture the flag style where you locate a crown icon and zoom it back to base. Depending on the level you're in, you're offered one type of tank out of an available three: The Mototank is quick but weak, the M1A1 is midsize and nicely armed, and the Goliath...slow and powerful. You're stuck with what you're given at the beginning of the level, so you better take it and like it, if you know what's good for you. You can also pick up limited power-ups like bouncing missiles and stealth capabilities that'll make being on the offensive a lot easier...and a lot more fun.  Even though each of the missions have different tasks, the revolving gameplay is exactly the same -- maneuver through the streets (or Las Vegas desert) locating and destroying enemy vehicles and turrets. What's cool is a lot of roadside obstacles can be destroyed -- cars and traffic lights can be run over, buildings can be blown up. Problem is, it's very selective in what can be taken out and what cannot -- while massive blue buildings can be taken out with relative ease, little knee-high pylons in the middle of the road can't even be touched. Obviously this is to block off certain areas and to reroute your attack path, but it could have been done with more graphical relevance to the situation. Like a massive hole blown in the ground, perhaps?  Graphics are nice, but perspective obviously wasn't followed here. Your tank can't drive behind objects at any point in the game. You can forgive this little ~feature~ in the city, where the tops of buildings line the streets ~above~ them, but wait until you get to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco -- the foreground bridge supports actually block your way. You just have to see it in action to understand what I'm talking about, but trust me -- it just looks stupid.  The other problem -- the game is incredibly easy. There are so many shield power-ups and extra lives to earn, the only reason to jot down the password at the end of each level is to give your eyes a break. You can easily beat the game in one sitting. A slap to the head of 3DO for forcing Lucky Chicken to pull the link-cable out of the game -- BattleTanx would have benefited greatly from the support, because the single player mode is just too darn short to recommend by itself. The game needs a lot more.  Still, it was a decent (albeit repetitive) hour and a half from start to finish. Thirty bucks for less than two hours. Hey, it's cheaper than a therapist, and here you get to blow stuff up. Picture Combat on the 2600, or Armor Attack on the Intellivision, and you've got a decent idea of BattleTanx on the Game Boy Color. It's an all right single player game, but you can see the potential of link-cable support. If only the game made it to market with the link-cable support intact, it would have brought this short, average game up a few notches.", "date": "Apr 11, 2000"}
