We're in a Battlefield generation, all fixed on cinematic realism and historical settings, massive online recreations of famous wars and battles, and the slower, more determined game play that this implies.  Even more action-focused titles like Call of Duty rely on realistic weapons and some play at historical accuracy.  These days, fragging online is as much about feeling the vintage uniform on your skin as it is getting in a high kill count.  Twitch-fest?  But I'm taking time to reload my authentic German MP40!   Well, kids, things are about to change.  Unreal is back, and you'd better get ready to feel the explosion.   Unreal Tournament 2004 is set to make a thunderous impact as big as (or bigger) than the one caused by the original Unreal Tournament.  It's as pretty as anything else out there (at least, until the first wave of DirectX 9 games hits).  It's got new game play depth that goes way beyond Deathmatch.  And best of all, it brings back the easy-to-pick-up, tough-to-put-down feel of the first Unreal Tournament.  Long-time fans know that's a high compliment indeed.   This game is good.  You probably already suspected that.  In fact, most of you have already checked out the fantastic demo that's been around for a month or so, so you have a pretty good idea of how much fun this game is.  Fine.  We'll take that as understood.  What we want to do here is talk about how the full version of UT2004 fares, and about just what kind of fun you'll be having.   Starting with Unreal Tournament 2003, Atari and Epic positioned the Unreal series as something of a sports franchise, with the implication that every year or two, a new edition of the game would appear, presumably offering new maps, modes, and ongoing improvements.  It's an iffy notion on paper, but Unreal Tournament 2004 makes a good case for the idea, as there's no doubt that this is a bigger, tighter, better game than the last.  Best of all, UT2004 isn't simply a refinement of UT2003 with new maps; two new game modes, the returning Assault and the brand-new Onslaught, are alone more than enough to justify the new title.   The new Tournament actually ships with all the maps included in UT2003, plus more new maps than the full number included in UT2003.  That's a generous package, and even if there were no new modes, the new maps and refined game play would make UT2004 worth considering.    Before we cover the new game modes, vehicles, and other goodies which are (rightly) getting the most attention, it's important to point out that along with the new content, UT2004 features a feel that's much closer to the first Unreal Tournament than UT2003's more deliberate pace.  It's hard to specify exactly why this is the case, but a few minutes with the new game and you'll instinctively feel it: the accessible, responsive, and blazingly fast game play of Unreal Tournament is back.  It's as if UT2003 did the work of overhauling the game's presentation with the new (and still stunning) Unreal engine, while UT2004 takes that as given and brings back the classic UT feel we loved so much in the first place.  You'll probably hear this from various people, but in almost every respect, UT2004 delivers on what UT2003 should have been.  Even the game's menu system and settings have been greatly improved.  The whole thing radiates polish.   Unreal Tournament 2004 ships with ten game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Invasion, Mutant, Capture the Flag, Bombing Run, Last Man Standing, Double Domination, Assault, and Onslaught (along with a generous selection of mutators).  We've gone into detail on the new modes in our various previews and hands-on, but now we can finally talk about how they actually play.   The Deathmatch modes are essentially unchanged from previous games: these are still the purest form of fragging free-for-all, all twitch and little deep thought (though the best Deathmatch players know plenty of dope tricks).  UT2004 ships with more Deathmatch maps than ever, including a new collection of maps designed specifically for 1-on-1 matches.  All the maps we've tried have the refined run-and-gun flow that the UT series is known for, with plenty of room for maneuvering but enough corners and vulnerable zones to keep things interesting.    Last Man Standing, Invasion, and Mutant are variations on conventional Deathmatches, and use the same maps.  Last Man Standing has all players start with a full arsenal and a limited number of lives, and features a ~camping warning~ if a player stands in place too long.  Mutant is largely a glorified mutator:  the first player to kill becomes a super-fast, all-weaponed Mutant, who is also the only player who can be harmed.  It then becomes a matter of pursuing the Mutant for the privilege of killing him and taking the title for yourself -- a nice change from the usual deathmatch.  Finally, Invasion pits all players against increasingly challenging waves of alien critters.  It's an interesting mode in concept, and the aliens eventually put up a good fight, but we can't help chuckling at how silly they look.  Their design and primitive animation make us feel like we're being attacked by characters from Space Invaders.   Capture the Flag and Double Domination change little in UT2004, though of course now there are a whole new selection of maps to choose from, in addition to older classics.  One seemingly small new feature, though, actually makes a big impact.  Pressing N or M now invokes a bright, comet-like indicator which races across the map and shows you the way to the red or blue base, respectively (or, in the case of Assault, the path to the next objective).  The feature is incredibly useful in Capture the Flag, Bombing Run, Assault, and Onslaught modes, where staying oriented can at times get a bit tricky.  Once you discover it, the path-finding will be a very welcome part of your repertoire.   Bombing Run also makes a return, and frankly we think it's a mode that deserves more props than it gets.  As before, each team is vying for control of a ball.  Pass the ball through the other team's goal, score a point.  Of course, the trick is that while you're carrying the ball, you are effectively defenseless, as pressing fire throws the ball.  Ball-tossing also opens up the possibility of passing the ball to a teammate, which can lead to some pretty savvy tactics which we still haven't seen too many people using.  Still, Bombing Run promises plenty to those willing to learn its nuances.   Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination -- these are all well and good (and we really do mean good).  But then, these are games we've been playing for a years now, and while it's fun to go for the simpler fragging now and then, we really can't lie to you here: most of your time is going to be spent on two modes, the shining jewels of UT2004: Assault and the game's megaton, Onslaught.  Believe us, vehicles are just the start here.   But first things first.  Assault, in which one team must accomplish a series of objectives while the other team tries to stop them, originally appeared in Unreal Tournament, but was depressingly absent in UT2003.  Well, Assault makes its return here, and it's better than ever.    Epic has gone out of their way to address complaints leveled at UT's original Assault -- confusion about objectives, disorientation on the map -- by adding a number of helpful guides and indicators.  First, the first time you load up an Assault map, a narrated intro movie explains the different objectives while the camera provides a fly-through to each one on the map.  Very helpful.  In game, an arrow on your HUD points in the absolute direction of the next objective, and the path-finding sprite (the N and M keys) are available to get you going the right way.  In other words, it's now difficult to get lost playing Assault, meaning you can put all your attention on the action at hand.   Along with Onslaught, the new Assault mode is where UT2004's much-anticipated vehicles come into play.  We'll go into detail on the vehicles in a bit here, but in the context of Assault, they add wonderful variety to level objectives.  One Assault map, for instance, centers on the acquisition and use of a massive tank with which the attack team needs to escape in order to succeed.  Even more impressive, another map starts with both teams piloting spacecraft for a Wing Commander-style dogfight, the attacking team attempting to board a giant Skaarj mothership.  Once the ship is boarded, the action switches on-foot.   Assault and Onslaught also include stationary turrets.  While some of the turrets in Assault are automatic, most turrets must be manned.  As with vehicles, a quick press of the Use key and you're in the seat, ready to lay on the damage.  Conventional turrets are plenty useful, but some maps feature Link Turrets, which, like the similar Link Gun, can chain together to create incredibly damaging fire.  Like the vehicles, they're very fun to use.    We've had a lot of fun with the new Assault.  The maps all seem well paced, with some objectives being easier or tougher than others.  This, along with the inclusion of vehicles, turrets, and changing pathways, add real variety to the rounds.  There are many ways to approach or defend each objective, and taking the time to learn each map and coordinate as a team can pay off very well, especially given that each map has strengths and vulnerabilities which aren't immediately apparent.  The only complaint, really, is that we're already eager for even more maps.  Not that the selection here is paltry -- the included maps can keep you busy for months, if not longer -- but more that it's easy to see the possibilities with this mode, and we can't wait to see what new maps appear.   Beating out all the other modes in variety, depth, and pure unrelenting addictiveness, though, is Onslaught.  If you've played the demo, or read anything at all about the game, you're already familiar with how this mode works.  But just as quick review: two teams try to take control of nodes scattered throughout the map, ultimately forming a link between their power base and their enemy's, at which point the enemy power base can be attacked and hopefully destroyed.  Oh, and there are vehicles.  Many of them.   As it looks on paper, Onslaught could be really tedious or really clumsy.  But anyone who's spent plenty of time with the Onslaught map included in the demo already knows that the mode is anything but clumsy.  Vehicles race to grab a new node.  One central, critical node becomes a hotbed of fire, both teams fighting to hold it down while sending the rest of their forces on a power base assault.  Suddenly a Goliath tank comes rolling in to crush a node (along with two or three players), only to be taken out by a lithe Raptor flying above.  The red team's dominance of all the nodes suddenly crumbles after some quick guerilla tactics and a well-placed Redeemer explosion.  The proceedings always change, the tactical possibilities are endless.   Given all that's going on in an Onslaught round, it could seemingly degenerate into total chaos.  The nature of forming a path using nodes, however, creates a natural battlefront that moves forward or back across the map, providing foci for battle and a direction for team coordination even if players aren't talking to each other.  A node being constructed or attacked is immediately evident on the overhead map, so it's easy to find where the action is.  Further, the links between nodes, which are customizable, have a dramatic effect on the tactics and pacing of the round.  A single Onslaught map can feel like three different games given three different node configurations.  Also interesting is how much the length of rounds varies.  One match can last for twenty minutes, both teams bringing the game down to a tense struggle over a crucial node, or the round can play out in just a few minutes, with a path to the enemy power base leaping across the map like lightning.  It all depends on the skill and choices of the teams involved.    While they make an appearance in Assault, it's in Onslaught where UT2004's vehicles take a starring role.  As you likely know by now, they work very well.  Speeding through a canyon on a Manta, decapitating a few guys on the way, is thoroughly satisfying.  As is taking out a node in three hits of a Goliath's fire.  Vehicle controls are accessible, but still offer enough nuance to allow for skill development, including a few features that are left for players to discover.  A few of the vehicles, like the Goliath or the Hellbender, become fierce when several players hop aboard.  Have we seen much of this before in games like Halo?  Sure, but that doesn't keep it from being just as fun here.  And Halo offers nothing even close to the Leviathan, a massive tank-like vehicle you'll find in a few of the maps.  It's slow-moving, but features four turret positions and heat-seaking fire.  Even better, when stationary, it can transform into something far more sinister, revealing a potent, doom-slinging ion cannon.  Think Redeemer on wheels.   Even more than the vehicles and sheer size of its maps, perhaps the most impressive thing about Onslaught is how much depth it introduces into the action-heavy Unreal Tournament formula.  If there's some question as to how a shamelessly twitch-heavy sci-fi themed title like UT2004 could fare in a time of Battlefield 1942, Onslaught is a big part of the answer.  How do you add complexity and depth to the classic frag-fest?  Nodes and vehicles, baby.  Another way to put it: if UT2004 were nothing but Onslaught, it would be well worth your time.    The weapons of Unreal Tournament 2004 are a mix of old classics and a group of new additions, many of which show up in support of Onslaught's new game play.  Old favorites like the Shock Rifle, Flak Cannon, Link Gun, and Rocket Launcher are here of course, and remain largely unchanged.  The Assault Rifle gets a bit more beef with both its grenade-launching secondary fire and the ability to double fist with two Assault Rifles at once (yes, that's as cool as it sounds).  Another nice change is in the Sniper Rifle, which now leaves a puff of smoke after discharging, making the shooter's location more conspicuous.  Other changes are minor, such as the Translocator firing rate being adjusted to make it harder to spam the field, and there are some cool, undocumented techniques to discover with many of the weapons, but long-time UT players will feel at home with the core arsenal.  What's worked this well for this long doesn't need much tweaking, and the core weapons are as tight and balanced as ever (though we leave opinion on the Bio-rifle open).   With Onslaught's powerful vehicles comes a roster of new weapons which provide balance for those players left on foot.  The most obvious is the AVRiL, a hand-held anti-vehicular missile launcher which can take down most vehicles in one or two shots.  Firing an AVRiL missile isn't enough, though, as the missile only homes in as long as you remain focused on your target, giving vehicles a chance to dodge out of the way.  Still, being armed with an AVRiL means you can hold your own on the ground when a Manta or two come at you with decapitating intentions.   You'll also have access to two forms of explosives: the Grenade Launcher and the Mine Layer.  The former discharges sticky grenades which cling to enemy vehicles, structures, or directly to players.  Better yet, the grenades explode at your command, using the secondary fire key, making for some very tasty guerrilla tactics (wait for a few players to cluster around your mine-laden node, then POW!: sweet multi-kill).  The Mine Layer offers an even more impressive variation: it launches spider mines which are programmed to maliciously crawl after and detonate into any nearby enemy player or vehicle.  The mines are flexible: leave them in wait as protection around a node, or use secondary fire to activate a laser pointer, and the mines will run to where it's pointing.  The mines can be destroyed, but it's actually kind of terrifying when a mob of the little bastards come chasing after you.    Along with these basic tactical tools come the big guns, which join the Redeemer in their hard-to-find but oh-so-sweet qualities.  The Ion Painter marks a target for a satellite-born heavy explosion, and the Target Painter calls in a dramatic air strike from an orbiting unmanned aircraft.  These are important, as they also provide good balance against the vehicles.  And yes, big bangs really do mean big fun.  Unless you're in the middle of one.   The new vehicles and weapons could have been a disaster if they didn't work so well together.  The game play in UT2004 is tuned to a fine point, bringing the new modes into the tradition of Unreal polish.  The most powerful vehicles are the slowest, or the toughest to control, for instance.  The biggest guns are the toughest to get to.  And just as you think you've mastered some unanswerable weapon or attack, someone else finds its weakness, and the process starts over.   That leads to another element that emerges in playing a lot of UT2004: given the various vehicles, weapons, guerrilla tactics, turrets, and spawn points, the tactical possibilities of Assault and Onslaught games are limitless.  Particularly in Onslaught, the unexpected often happens.  Two players jump onto the wings of a Manta for a ride, for instance, or a Goliath tank is sabotaged by a player dropping from a Raptor above.  The grenades and spider mines alone allow for all sorts of nasty tricks, which we won't go into here, because we'd like to dominate in matches as long as we can before the secrets get out.   But that learning curve, and the number of things possible in the game, give the new modes in UT2004 a very real depth, beyond just tactical considerations or basic fragging skill.  That Epic has introduced such complexity into the game without betraying its twitch-shooter roots is perhaps the greatest accomplishment of UT2004.  The game offers an easy in -- anyone can learn to shoot and frag -- but pays off in the long run as its subtleties reveal themselves.  We've been playing the heck out of Onslaught, and we're only just beginning to master some of the elements of the game.    It's worth mentioning, too, that while UT2004, like its predecessors, has multiplayer as its raison d'etre, there's plenty of fun to be found playing solo as well.  UT2004 offers the same sort of ladder-based single-player campaign that UT2003 had, which is fun enough on its own.  Better, though, is that the bots in UT2004 are smarter than they ever have been.  Even at Experienced, which is only midway up their available skill levels, the AI in the game will give you a real challenge, even in Onslaught.  Set it much higher, and you'll start sweating.   Visually, the new Unreal Tournament is just as pretty as you'd expect.  The engine hasn't changed much, at least on the surface, from the great leap forward we saw in UT2003.  With detail and texture levels cranked up high, this is still one of the best-looking PC games around, even if it isn't using all the DirectX 9 bells and whistles that have been hyped so much lately.  Reflective surfaces, dynamic weapon lighting, character shadows, particle effects, complex outdoor levels -- all the important goodies are here.  There's plenty of attention paid to details, as well.  Elements like falling snow or shafts of light breaking through sunset-stained clouds are things you might not notice much in the high action of a firefight, but the overall effect is quite impressive.  Weapon effects are appropriately dramatic, as Link Gun lines leap across the screen and glowing flak bounces dangerously around a dark corridor.  Epic has also paid good attention to the player models, which are as detailed as they need to be for a game as quick-moving as this.  Also, they've made team color part of the full player skin, rather than the glowing shoulder orbs of old, making team identification much easier.   But the visual impact isn't just in the power of the engine or small details.  The art direction in general deserves applause.  Many of the maps are beautifully designed.  The vastness of the Onslaught maps allow for gorgeous canyons and dramatic towers.  A Deathmatch map takes place in a castle made entirely of ice, its halls glimmering as you run through them.  One Capture the Flag map features two bases separated by a lush green canyon, the whole map dotted with Chinese lanterns and a subtle Asian motif.  It's truly breathtaking.   There is a cost involved, however: despite the humble specs on the box, you'll want a fairly current hardware set-up to see UT2004 properly, or even smoothly enough that aiming doesn't become tough when too much action fills the screen, taxing lesser video cards and processors.  Low frame rates do not a fun shooter make.  Still, even with a more humble set-up, settings can be tweaked to get smooth performance -- you just might not be running at a high resolution with all the bells and whistles turned on.    It's a little disappointing that the sound in UT2004 doesn't quite match the splendor of its visuals.  Some of the music is actually quite good -- especially for the Onslaught maps -- but plenty of it is the same rather generic techno stuff we've heard since the first Unreal Tournament.  Sound effects are appropriately quick and violent, and localize well if you've got a full digital surround setup.  Unfortunately, the male announcer, Captain Obnoxious himself, makes a comeback.  He can still be switched to one of the more-pleasant female voices, but you'll still have to hear the similarly tacky player taunts (~Die bitch!~ and ~My house!~ got really old years ago).  As we mentioned in our UT2003 review, it would be nice to hear some creativity and variety here, but at this point, it's the same old collection of sophomoric jibes.   New in UT2004, however, is a feature which lets you add your own much more clever taunts, as well as important team communication to the game, and that's voice-over-IP support.  Plug a USB headset into your PC and you'll be able to talk to your teammates live, working out tactics or just trash talking.  The voice actually works fairly well, as long as you're working with a low ping, but it's still not at the level of always-on clarity offered in Xbox Live.  Still, it works, and makes team coordination much, much easier.  Woe to those facing a team fully armed with headsets.Given that Epic had already reached a sweet, sweet point with the original Unreal Tournament, and some would argue with UT2003, it was fair to wonder what more they could do with the next iteration of the series.  Well, it's easy to say they've delivered, and then some.  A huge selection of new maps, gorgeous graphics, improved game play, and the return of Assault are generous enough.  But the addition of Onslaught, with its powerful vehicles and tactical variety, makes UT2004 into a multiplayer behemoth, offering enough action, depth, and expansion possibilities (just think of the mods here, people), to justify keeping UT2004 on your hard drive for a long, long time.  Has Epic provided an alternative to a glut of military-themed shooters?  Hell yes they have.  That, and then some.", "date": "Mar 12, 2004"}
