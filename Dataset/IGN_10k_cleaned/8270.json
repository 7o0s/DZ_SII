Movie Edition Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/23/scene-it-movie-edition-review", "text": "Board games are enjoying a renaissance period and one of the biggest beneficiaries of the renewed goodwill toward the living room sport is Scene It. Namco Networks recognizing the enormous popularity and fortunate that network speeds are finally fast enough to make over-the-air video clips possible, brought the Movie Edition of Scene It? to mobile gamers. But does this movie-themed pop culture trivia game make a successful transition to handsets?   Players compete is timed trivia contests by watching video clips and looking at photos as well as answering regular text questions. The categories are taken straight from the original board game, such as Invisibles. Player check out a disassembled movie still or publicity photo and try to ID the subject as pieces fade into view. The faster to get the answer, the more points you bank. Points are used in lieu of progressing across the physical board. It's a fair trade off since there's a really good chance you're going to play alone even thought he game does offer a stab at multiplayer. The game has a few mobile-centric modes, such as Weekly Dozen challenges.   Technically, Scene it? impresses. I tested the game on an LG Fusic (on Sprint) and found the video clips and photo to be of excellent quality. The catch is waiting for downloads. Mercifully, Sprint offers an all-you-can-eat data package, because some video clips took a minute or so to download. The wait may trouble some gamers that are truly pressed for time, but since video is only one part of the overall package, it's not a big deal. What's important is that the video is very watch-able.   What matters most is if Namco Networks properly emulated the popular DVD board game -- and having played the game on multiple occasions, I can tell you that they indeed have. Sure, you're missing the board part of it, but the spirit of the game is intact. And I suspect that's what is most important to fans -- watching the videos, peeking at the pictures, and trying to answer a question as fast as possible. The social atmosphere is still possible through pass-and-play, but via an online leaderboard, you can compare your scores to other fans.   My only real complaint is actually one coming strictly from the movie snob side of me: The game is too mired in the low hanging fruit of pop culture. When the game refers to ~The Pink Panther,~ it's talking about the Steve Martin remake. It asks you to identify ~Ghostbusters.~ I'm sorry there is no difficulty setting that juices the game with questions about Woody Allen movies, film noir, or westerns. I like ~The Terminator~ as much as the next person -- seriously, I do -- but the game is too much of a breeze for anybody with more than a slight passing knowledge of movies.  Namco Network's first Scene It? is a smartly translated edition of the popular DVD board game. The quality of photos and video is quite good, which is the likely trade off for some occasionally longer-than-expected loading times. I found the game to be entirely too easy, but I'm an admitted movie snob. (If Namco released a Sports Edition, I'd be sunk.) If you like Scene It? or breezy trivia games, there's some good fun to be had here.", "date": "Mar 23, 2007"}
