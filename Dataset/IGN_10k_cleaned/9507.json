So it's disappointing that publisher DSI's Nintendo DS game of the same name features none of the name boxers that have appeared on that program, and little of its polish and excitement either. Showtime Championship Boxing from developer Nikitova Games is a game that at a glance (and perhaps in screenshots) looks like a solid 3D sports title, but upon closer inspection is a sloppy mess that wouldn't be allowed to step foot in the ring.    The game offers seventeen fictional boxers such as Lazy Lorenzo and Punchbag Pat to select from, although in most modes the player can only select from about six fighters. There are no stats per boxer, but in the Boxer Profiles section of the game, strengths and weaknesses for each character are described. The player fights through (and unlocks) five different boxing modes, each essentially the same as the last but with an extra boxer or two to face before being awarded the belt.    The game uses the four face buttons to block high, low, left or right. Tapping the L or R button while holding one of these buttons throws a punch. It may sound odd to use the same buttons for blocking and punching, but the L and R system makes it very easy to alternate between attack and defense, as well as land any punch without having to remember complicated button combinations. Looking beyond its decent controls however, the game begins to fall apart.    There are serious discrepancies between scoring and visual feedback. In my first round, I delivered upward of a hundred visibly clean jabs to my opponent's face, yet it barely dented his energy. My boxer, on the other hand, was struck maybe a dozen times and quickly knocked down. I can understand playing down the effectiveness of certain types of punches, but this has to be reinforced visually to let the player know it isn't working. If an enemy has been wobbling his head from basic punches for 3 straight minutes, he shouldn't be standing.    When a boxer goes down, there is no button mashing or gameplay mechanic to build up energy. In fact, pressing any button during this time, or before and after a fight, skips the cutscene completely. This can be jarring as a slip of the button can take the player from their last punch to the main menu in about two seconds.    A common problem with bad sports games is allowing the player to exploit their opponent's AI and play the game in a way that's unrealistic. This game is so unbalanced that almost any opponent can be beaten to pieces by using the same punch over and over. I found that by performing a left hook with the Y and L buttons over and over until my boxer ran out of stamina, blocking with the X button until my stamina returned and then repeating, I could take down most opponents in a matter of seconds, often resulting in a first round TKO. In fact, picking one punch and exploiting it is so reliable that fights can really be played by only looking at the top screen HUD, because what the 3D boxers are doing down on the bottom screen has little bearing on the outcome.    Boxers do become more difficult as the game progresses, in both punch strength and frequency. However, their AI is simple enough that they always, reliably dodge one punch by leaning in the opposite direction. So if the player throws a body shot with the right hand and it's blocked, they can immediately throw a series of left hooks that will almost always connect. By selecting two opposite punches, alternating between them and blocking every time stamina bottoms out, even the toughest fighters can often be TKO'd in the first few rounds. Because of this, all five game modes can be completed in an hour or so.    So why doesn't this game get a 1 out of 10? Because in spite of its laundry list of flaws, it's still inexplicably fun. Bobbing around the ring and pummeling on a guy seems to be a universally enjoyable experience, as long as the controls are responsive (which they are). While the game is severely unbalanced and far too easy to excel at, the 3D fighters are handled well enough to keep things amusing.    The game is mostly 3D and like the programming, has its share of good and bad. On the good side, the 3D boxer models are well detailed and textured, substantially higher in their polycounts than most 3D characters on the DS. The 3D rings look good and the pre- and post-fight cinematics, although playing at a very low frame rate, add character to the events. On the bad side there's, well, everything else. The crowd is made out of flat billboard images (think Doom), thrown together so lazily that the seams between each chunk of people is visible. Couple that with the fact that the 2D crowd is angled back, and it looks like someone printed out posters of fans and laid them out over an arena of empty seats. The top screen displays a pixel-animated crowd, but they look muddy and barely animate.    The boxers also animate poorly, which is a shame because standing still they look pretty good. Their movements are jerky and lack any anticipation or follow through. Sometimes they walk and sometimes they glide without moving their feet at all. Each time a blow is landed on an opponent, his head wobbles violently like a real-life bobble-head. The head seems to wobble regardless of where a boxer is hit, even in the gut. The characters are rigged poorly, which refers to how their polygons are set up to bend as they move. So when a boxer blocks for example, his shoulders get stuck in an unnatural triangle shape, essentially breaking the model. When fat boxers hunch over, their stomachs deflate into an L shape. It ain't pretty.    In addition to the seventeen sometimes-selectable boxers, there are four different arenas and the player can adjust round count, weight class (welterweight and heavyweight only) and shorts color. Only the Single Fight mode is initially available. Once the player beats that, the Amateur Belt unlocks, then the Contender Belt, the Showtime Belt and finally King of the Ring mode, where every boxer must be beat in a row without round times. Cut scenes and sound can be turned off, and the game offers information on controls, hints and tips, and boxer profiles that reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each character. A two-player local wireless mode is available, although it requires two copies of the game.  Showtime Championship Boxing is a bad game because it lacks depth, is ugly and easy to exploit. At the same time, I couldnt help but enjoy myself as I beat down fighter after fighter. The 3D boxers look great, even if they move awkwardly, and in spite of its overwhelming flaws the game does have a charm to it. I cant really recommend the game to anyone in light of its many problems, but boxing fans willing to overlook serious gameplay issues in favor of some quick and dirty pummeling might actually enjoy themselves.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
