Of course, when you're working with a property as revered as the movie Reservoir Dogs, any developer's going to have its work cut out to please the movie's legion of rabid fans.   Things seemed to start off on the right foot though, with Reservoir Dogs courting the same kind of controversy the movie enjoyed fourteen years ago. Rumours of the game's extreme content managed to furrow all the right eyebrows, and it even managed to get banned over in Australia. Now that we've got the final game in our hands, does it do justice to Quentin Tarantino's seminal debut?   In a nutshell, not really. The main problem is that Reservoir Dogs the movie wasn't ideal material to base an action-focused game on. Given that the majority of the film is about a bunch of men nattering in a warehouse, developer Volatile Games had to take more than a few liberties with its source material - and the end result isn't exactly what you'd call faithful to its roots.    Sure, all the characters are there (even if Mr. Blonde's the only recognizable character, with Michael Madsen providing his voice and likeness - unlike the movie's other stars) and you'll spot plenty of the movie's more memorable scenes. However, to 'action' things up a bit, Volatile's fleshed out some of the unseen side-stories preceding the bank heist, plot point merely alluded to in the movie. For example, you'll follow Mr. Blue as he escapes the chaos of the failed heist, Mr. Pink as he returns to retrieve his stashed diamonds and Mr. Blonde as he visits the mall.   Reservoir Dogs features two distinct styles of gameplay - driving and third-person on-foot sections. Driving sections are fairly straightforward affairs, tasking you with simple objectives like hitting checkpoints within the time limit or keeping above a certain speed while you shake the cops on your tail. However, despite the inclusion of a Burnout-style boost awarded for classy driving and some occasional high-speed chase thrills, belting along in your car rarely approaches anything above functional.   Things fair better on-foot though, with Volatile adding a few neat tricks to the proceedings. Despite the furor over the game's content (for the record, aside from the occasional blood squirt and occasional off-camera maiming, there's very little here that'd make your granny gasp), Reservoir Dogs is as much about coercing your opponents into surrendering as it is blowing their faces off. Alongside your usual roster of familiar weapons, like pistols and machine guns, you've also got the ability to capture hostages and threaten your enemies.     Once you've got a hostage in your grip, you can bellow a few choice words at your opponents in a bid to make them lay down arms. Enemies come in three varieties - security guards, cops and SWAT members - and each requires a little more coercion to break their steely resolve. Security guards will drop weapons instantly following a threat to kill your captive, while cops and SWAT members are made of sterner stuff. To show them you mean business you'll have to pistol-whip your hostage before they'll drop their weapons. When opponents are disarmed, you can target them individually and use the right thumb stick to move them around. They can either perform useful tasks like opening a safe, or you can order them to get on their knees, neutralizing them as a threat - unless they see you open fire on anyone else.   Each playable character also has a special signature move - a particularly nasty way of dispatching someone which causes everyone in the vicinity to lay down arms, presumably in disgust. Mr. Blonde is fond of a bit of ear-severance, while Mr. Pink happily stoves a man's face in with the butt of his gun - all off-camera of course, mother. There's also the option to unleash a Bullet Festival - an avalanche of slow-mo shooting - once you've notched up aggro by gunning down your opponents.     Essentially you're given free reign on how you tackle a level, leaving as few or as many fatalities as you like. Play it like the gentleman and the game ranks you as a Professional, kill too many people though and you slide from Career Criminal to Psycho, meaning you're a morally reprehensible loon. Well done!   Truthfully though, on-foot missions tend to be pretty uninspiring affairs in practice, with the game simply demanding you get from point A to B in order to progress. Aside from occasionally shooting the lock off a door, there's literally nothing in the way of puzzles or obstacles to spice things up - you'll be swiping hostages and neutralizing cops from beginning to end. Miraculously though, things never start to feel repetitive, thanks largely to the regular distraction offered by the driving segments - levels never outstay their welcome and Volatile's unique spin on third-person shooting keep things engaging.  For all its gloss (the inclusion of the movie's entire iconic soundtrack gets two thumbs up) and flashes of inspiration, Reservoir Dogs never really rises above average.It does have enough neat tricks up its sleeve to make the game's relatively swift playtime enjoyable. If you're looking for something to pass the time on a rainy weekend, there's enough here to warrant a rental. Ultimately it's all just a little too ho-hum as a game and unfortunately so far removed from its celluloid counterpart in terms of atmosphere, style and story that it's unlikely to do much for fans of the movie either.", "date": "Sep 1, 2006"}
