I suppose this review has been rather longer than most people can be bothered to read, so if you made it this far, good for you. I guess the bottom line is this -- everything I loved and appreciated about Hot Date I love and appreciate in Vacation. I love being able to have Sims leave the house, go somewhere else, meet new people, buy new things, and have new things to do. But by the same token, the things that annoyed me about Hot Date -- fixed behavior and appearances for the worker NPCs, no death or danger or passing out, limited access to your object collection in build mode -- annoys the heck out of me here too.But probably the biggest disappointment I have with Vacation is that it only does what Hot Date did and no more -- there's no quantum step forward in terms of interaction or exploration. There's no school or workplace. There's no SimCity street to walk down and get mugged on. There's no new skills, no new interests, no new job tracks, no duties, no dangers, no excitement, nothing more serious than a bad flu. Heck, there's not even a slide projector for your Sims to show off their lousy vacation pics to their bored neighbors.All my complaints though, I know, could be addressed were Electronic Arts willing to actually invest in Maxis and give them the resources and the time to expand the line, instead of canceling Sims games and laying people off. How ironic is that? The Sims -- a game the EA didn't even want to release -- has made more money for the company than most of the rest of their fare?So Vacation is still a must for any serious Sims fan, and you'll end up having fun with it. I know I did. Still, I can only hope that future expansion packs and sequels get away from the tongue-in-cheek parodying of materialist society and back to the business of the entertaining simulation of a broad-range of human behavior, with as much power in the users' hands as the engine can possibly allow.That, after all, is why we're playing The Sims and not Myst.", "date": "Oct 12, 2004"}
