Now, Gauntlet has never been an elaborate game by any stretch of the imagination, but the lack of any multiplayer support completely takes away from the original's design intention: this hack 'n slash absolutely requires additional players to squeeze out any fun to be had. It also doesn't help in the least that the level designs in this GBA game are unimaginative, repetitive and take way too long to complete. Features Four playable characiters 27 levels Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Pocket Studios, the developer of past GBA games such as Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring and Army Men: Operation Green are set to the task of recreating the 3D Gauntlet remake in the arcade and on the consoles for the Game Boy Advance hardware. Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is essentially a mindless action game where players, as one of four different classes of warriors, run through a maze of 27 different locations, shooting and slashing a seemingly endless supply of enemy creatures all the while picking up keys to unlock doors, and scoring food for health and potions for magic attacks. That's pretty much the whole shebang.  The team at Pocket Studios continues its past trend of isometric game design by building an angled perspective to mimic the 3D style of the console and arcade game. But you know what? It just doesn't work. The original game featured a top-down viewpoint so that players can easily target enemies from far away, something that isn't possible in this angled perspective. The designers obviously realized this gameplay limitation, so it added an ~auto-aiming~ feature that, essentially, makes the game even more mindless and bland because players don't need to do any skillful targetting to eliminate enemies. It's just simply a game where players hold down the action button and let the game do all the work. The engine doesn't even feature shadows for the sprites, which pretty much ruins the 3D effect the developers were trying to go for.  The absolute travesty about Gauntlet: Dark Legacy isn't its dark and muddy graphics, bland gameplay repetitive audio soundtrack, or overall lack of any sort of creativity in its level design. No, it's the fact that someone at Midway greenlighted the development team to build the GBA game as a single-player title. Every version of Gauntlet has been a multiplayer, co-operative action game for a reason, and eliminating this gameplay mode from the Game Boy Advance, a system that's made to be networked, just shows that the individuals responsible for this game didn't care about the franchise at all. At least Midway threw some money into the project by including a cartridge EEPROM to save the character's progress, but the development team didn't take advantage of this feature; the levels are absolutely massive, and for a handheld game, the game absolutely needs the ability to save the game anywhere during the action. As it is, players can only save the game at the overworld, which takes an agonizingly long time to get to if you're in the middle of a level. If I had been in charge of the Gauntlet project, I would have canned the whole Dark Legacy port. Instead, I would have put the team to work on reproducing the 1985 original on the Game Boy Advance hardware, with emphasis on getting the engine to fit in a multi-boot file so that anyone with a GBA system could jump in and connect for four player connectivity. It could have been done, and it should have been done...and probably would have taken less time than attempting a ground-up GBA recreation of an arcade and console sequel that wasn't that great to begin with.", "date": "Jan 14, 2003"}
