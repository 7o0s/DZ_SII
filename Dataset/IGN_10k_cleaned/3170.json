The video amphibian kicked off his GBA career earlier this year in Frogger's Adventures: Temple of the Frog, with a conversion of the original Frogger arcade game in Konami's Arcade Classics a few weeks later. Vicarious Visions updated the little guy further with a traditional platformer in the form of Frogger Advance: The Great Quest a few months after that. And now, appearance number four is Frogger's Adventures 2: The Lost Wand, a revisit to the first Frogger GBA title that's honestly just a bunch of new levels in the already established gameplay. But since the first Frogger's Adventures was a charming and fun set of levels, we're not complaining about more of the same...especially when the development team went in and added single-cartridge multiplayer challenges and time trial modes.  Features Five worlds 15 different levels Cartridge save (three slots) Link cable support for four players (single and multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  Poor, bored Frogger wants to go on another adventure. That's pretty darn convenient considering the swamp's started going all crazy with magic. Apparently the Eternity Wand has shattered into five pieces (videogame cliche #12), and it's up to Frogger to get back all of the shards before the whole world's overrun by chaotic magic.  Five shards, five different areas to hop through. Basically, each of the game's areas are broken down into two levels of Frogger action, already established in the first Frogger's Adventures. Instead of hopping through traffic and over a river as the original arcade game was designed, Frogger must now leap through scrolling areas of different hazards, from suspended mazes to expansive land areas with wandering enemy characters patrolling in a set pattern. In each of these levels, players can snag these tear-drop looking things that will award an extra life after 20 have been collected. Each level also has four ~hidden~ cards that will unlock a secret area if players find them all. After beating both levels in an area, it's a challenge against a specific boss to snag the wand shard that he holds in his possession.   To be honest, there hasn't been much added to the gameplay that Konami introduced last year in Frogger's Adventures: The Temple of the Frog. The Lost Wand is pretty much just an upgrade; 15 new levels and slightly enhanced graphics within the already established engine. The challenges are slightly harder this time around, but these levels alone aren't worth the price of admission alone. Thankfully, that's not all you're getting in the sequel.  For Frogger's Adventures 2, the designers produced a few welcome additions. Most notably, players can now link up to four Game Boy Advance systems and take advantage of three pretty cool multiplayer levels. Reverse Tag challenges players to be ~it~ for 30 seconds, hopping away from opponents in the arena. In Balloon, players hop to the center point of the arena and try to carry back all four different colored balloons to their corner. And in Race, it's a ~simple~ Frogger challenge where players have to hop through the standard hazards laid out in front of them. Reverse Tag and Balloon aren't a whole lot of fun with only two players, but Race is great for however many you can get in the network. And for the solitaire player, any of the completed levels can be replayed in the Time Trial challenges, where the three top times per round are recorded right to the cartridge. This was a feature that was requested in our review of the original Frogger's Adventures, so we're very pleased the developers listened. Though Frogger's Adventures 2 is more of the same, it's more of the stuff that made the original game a lot of fun to play. That, on top of the new multiplayer modes (all of which support single cartridge link) and time trial modes, make the sequel a much better package.", "date": "Nov 11, 2002"}
