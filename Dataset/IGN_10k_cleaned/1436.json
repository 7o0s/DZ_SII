When my parents came to visit, I made them dig the sucker out of storage, pack it up and bring it with them on the plane. I carefully unwrapped the mighty board from its temporary place in the army duffle and gazed at it with wonder.   The bottom is so scarred from attempted grinds that none of the bottom graphics can be seen. The hot pink grip tape (don't ask) is a mess, worn and caked with dirt. The trucks are gouged; the wheels have seen better days. But I took that bad boy out on the street, hoping to relive some of the glory years... You know, those times back in high school when Powell Peralta was calling every day, Gatorade was contacting my agent about endorsement deals, and nubile professional tennis players were at my beck and call. The years before the accident.  Luckily, although I never fully recaptured my skating skills (when I actually took my board out, I could barely ollie, sniff, sniff), I have been able to nurture a surrogate skating existence through the magic of computer entertainment. Tony Hawk Pro Skater did for me a year ago. This year, it's Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2, a masterful version of the best skateboarding game around.  Activision and Treyarch sustain the groove with this amazing offering. In addition to the same addictive gameplay and improved graphics, THPS2 offers a whole slew of new features designed to satiate even the most hardcore Tony gamer.  The best of these are the ability to customize your gaming experience via Create Skater and Park Editor modes. It is unbelievable what this will do for the replay value of a title. Anyone who complains about too few levels will be squelched. In addition to the eight Career levels and two Secret levels, THPS2 offers 60 pre-made parks available for sessioning in the Free Skate, Two-Player and Single Session modes.   If this isn't enough for you, the game allows you to become a course designer, giving you all the tools you need to build a dope park. Choose from all of the pieces found in the game: from funboxes to quarterpipes to shrubberies. Set a theme to give your course a School, Industrial, Warehouse or Outdoor theme, then go skate! The interface is extremely easy to use; there's no wading through the instruction manual to figure out how to use the editor. Everything is intuitive, which is how it should be. I'd rather sink my thought into how the pieces will fit to make for the most sessioning potential than how to manipulate the pieces on the board. The only drawback to the course feature is that you're limited by space because of memory concerns. This is a bummer, but you can still make pretty phat parks based on what you're given.  The Create Skater mode allows you to personalize the game. Do you absolutely need to skate as Calvin Coolidge? Then create a skater for the former president. Wanna take yourself inside the game and shred the pro circuit? Now you can. There are plenty of head options (including mullet) and clothing styles, but no female skaters are offered yet. This is a little wonky, as Elissa Steamer is one of the best skaters in the game. Even so, Create Skater is ultra-cool, and a wonderful secret makes it even better. If you beat the game 100% with your created skater, Spider-Man is unlocked and fully playable in the Career course. The webslinger comes strapped with his own slate of decks and secret moves as well. Sweet!  Uniformly, the secrets in this game are beefy. Each time you earn three gold medals in Career Mode, you unlock a new cheat. Examples include Moon Physics, Wireframe Mode, Infinite Balance and Officer Dick. Getting gaps is virtually fetishized in the game. There is a list of all gaps in the game (easily four times the amount in TH1) contained in the Options menu, so you can track your progress. If you get all of the gaps in the game, you'll unlock the ultra-slutty Private Carrera, who comes complete with a lingerie costume.  Career mode has changed slightly, but for the better. Instead of competing for tapes, you are skating for money. The cumulative money you collect goes toward unlocking courses. However, you also get to use the money as cash, deciding to spend it on more Stats, a better deck, new Tricks, etc. There are about twice as many objectives per level, so there is plenty of opportunity to rack up the coin. This system works well. You feel in control of your destiny. If you need more air to reach a Secret Tape, you can buy it after completing some of the other objectives. Great game design.  The new levels are massive, reflecting the large number of objectives needed to complete each. There are eight Career courses and two secret courses that are unlocked by completing the game with all of the skaters. As in the original, these places are based on real skate locations. In the case of School II, it is a combination of many different So Cal schools. Philadelphia is a mix of Franklin Park and Phillyside. Skatestreet in Ventura appears as is. If you are good enough, you can unlock Skate Heaven, an ethereal ride in the heavens in which God and Satan vie for your skating soul. This level is worth all of the unlocking, as it is a skater's dream. Famous skate spots (like Tony's back yard) are recreated alongside twisting tunnels and Escher buildings. All of it is floating in space.    Of course, what really set the original apart from every skateboarding game that preceded it was the gameplay. Every environment was completely playable. Every surface could be skated, every high rail reached, every ramp transferred. The smooth-as-silk engine made you feel in total control of your rider's actions. If you needed to air into a nosegrind, you could do that at the last second. This game picks up where the last one left off, except that it adds a few key elements to boost control and enjoyment even more.  There are tons of new tricks in this one. Not only have the basic tricks been beefed up to include multiple button presses, but each skater now has three special moves. In addition, each skater can pick up more tricks by purchasing them with money earned in Career Mode.  Some basic moves have also been added that contribute significantly to the gameplay. Wallriding is easier to pull off (and more integral in gameplay), the boneless and no comply have been added to the ollie tricks. Then, there is the manual, probably the greatest addition of all. A manual is basically a skateboard wheelie, and it allows your skater to link tricks across flat surfaces. You know what that means: massive strings of tricks and unbelievable scores. The manual has revolutionized an already revolutionary game. Can it get any better than this? THPS3 will be interesting, to be sure.  In addition to the stellar gameplay, the game looks beautiful and runs smoothly. The textures have improved considerably, not only over the PC and PSX versions, but last year's TH Dreamcast offering as well. Just make a side-by-side comparison of the texture on the Marseille bowl from the PC and DC version. It's not even a contest. The Dreamcast version is pure butta. While last year's Hawk had a twinge of pop-up and fog, this one is crystal clear. In addition, there is virtually no drop in framerate. Bottom line, this game is smoooooth.   The most amazing aspect of the graphics, however, is the lighting. The shadows are crisp and accurate and the light is specific to environment. The Marseilles Bowl Jam takes place at dusk, in a hazy sunset. School II and Venice Beach are skated in the harsh light of Southern California. New York's a night course, and the pools of light cast by the street lamps are beautiful. More great attention to detail makes this a seriously pretty game.  Skater animations are also nice, but this is the area where the graphics have improved the least. That's not to say they aren't still awesome. There aren't as many polys in the riders' models than in, say, Soul Calibur, but they get the job done. The ollying and grind animations are pretty much the same, but the bails have changed. Try hanging on to a grind too long, and you'll pay the price in family jewels.   Although it seems impossible, Activision has assembled an even better selection of music than in the first game. Rage Against the Machine, Naughty By Nature, Powerman 5000 and Bad Religion headline a stellar group of punk-pop and hip hop acts. The cycle of songs is a bit longer this time, so it is tougher to get sick of the music. Even after beating the game with five skaters, I wasn't tired of these tracks. Highlights include ~Cyclone~ by the Dub Pistols and ~Bring the Noise~ by Anthrax/Public Enemy.   The sound effects are excellent as well. When you're skating on masonite, the wheels whirr. When you're grinding concrete, it is a gritty noise indeed. Rails sound perfectly metallic and bails are as visceral as ever. You can even hear the wheels spinning as you grab big air. This attention to detail is outstanding.   In addition, each individual environment has its own ambient noises. In New York, cabbies squawk at you as you veer in front of them. In the distance, you can hear gun shots and screaming. While these aren't the most PC sound effects out there, they help give this game a little attitude. During the Marseilles competition, the announcer speaks in French while the apathetic crowd gives you half-hearted support. Venice Beach is host to ill-mannered bums who curse as you ollie them, and   My only complaint is that in competition levels, the crowd seems to cut in and out rather abruptly. In a game that so accurately captures most everything else, this sticks out a bit. Minor, to be sure, but worth mentioning.  Of course, what it all boils down to is the almighty dollar. Will you get your fifty dollars' worth out of this game? The answer goes a little something like this: ~Hell yeah!~ This is one of the most infinitely replayable games out there. There are plenty of courses to session, plenty of riders to choose. Tons of secret stuff will have you questing to complete the game with every character there is. In addition, this time if you get sick of the pre-made stuff, you can create your own skaters and parks.  This is a true sequel to an already amazing game. It is as sequels should be: more of the things that made the original good, coupled with a bushel basket of extra features that make the game even better. If you were a fan of the first one, drop whatever you're doing and run to the store. If you didn't take a look at Tony Hawk I, now is your chance to experience one of the best games of all time. There, I've said it.  Chris Carle, IGN.com I actually was so addicted to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater that I bought a Dreamcast when it was released for Sega's little swirl-branded box. I figured I'd bite the bullet (knowing a price drop would come) and finally pick the system up. THPS2 played like a dream (pun intended), and was absolutely one of the best pieces of software on the market at the time. Above all, it was a stellar game among all ever created -- yes, it's that good. You'll notice I continue to say ~was,~ which is past tense. Does that mean it's not good a year later? Absolutely not, but Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, which promises to deliver a lot of new features, will be on the market in a few months. The truth is die-hard fans are better off buying a next-generation console than plopping down $60 for an N64 game. You can buy GameCube for another $140 dollars or another next-generation console and invest in the future. And if you get an Xbox you can have Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2X, which is an amazing version of the game. The sad fact is that the Nintendo 64 is history. However, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a game you should no go without, especially if you enjoyed the original. If you don't own a Dreamcast, and you're not purchasing a next-generation console within the next year and you will actually still play your Nintendo 64 over the next few months then I suggest purchasing it. The fact is, THPS2 is still the best skateboarding game on the market. And the N64 version comes with the same addiction factor.", "date": "Nov 7, 2000"}
