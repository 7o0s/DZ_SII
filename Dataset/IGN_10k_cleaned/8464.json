Gameloft snapped up the mobile rights for Shrek the Third, the three-quel to the billion-dollar ogre franchise from Dreamworks. Shrek is tasked with finding an heir to his step-father's throne so he can finally retire to his beloved swamp. With the kingdom in jeopardy due to the vulnerable monarchy, Prince Charming strikes. With the help of Donkey and Puss, the orge must turn back Charming's army of storybook villains and restore the royal lineage.   The game plays out like a classic 16-bit side-scroller. Those of you that noticed a, well, pattern with the last few 2D adventures from Gameloft -- King Kong, Mission Impossible III, Splinter Cell, etc. -- will find Shrek the Third treading familiar territory. This plays very similarly to those previous games, which were heavy on platforming action. There is a lot of jumping across ledges and attacking enemies. However, Shrek the Third is set entirely in a day-glo universe and the violence is 100-percent comical.   Even though they seemingly occupy the same genre, Shrek and his friends have a few moves not shared by Ethan Hunt or Sam Fisher, such as a barrel roll or a butt-stomp. Shrek throws cannonballs at pirates. He pulls up magical tree roots and then stomps the trunks into sawdust. He rushes scallywags and beats them into submission with his massive meathooks. Shrek the Third is entirely suitable for the younger set, but older players that like the characters will still get a mild kick out of Shrek's brand of mayhem. In the first boss encounter, as an example, Puss in Boots drops in to run interference against a Cyclops. His weapon of choice? A cuddly face that stops the Cyclops in his tracks, letting Shrek get in a cannonball attack.   The game makes ample use of Shrek's sidekicks. Donkey and Puss help out with explaining new game mechanics, show up in boss battles, and generally make their presence felt. You'll also get to play a side-scrolling shooter sequence with Donkey's wife, the big pink and purple dragon. Dragon rains fire down on the wicked witches in Prince Charming's employ while collecting pixies. This is a nice change of pace from the platforming action and one of the game's highlights. Special bonus for smartly aping the satellites from Konami's Gradius franchise. Dragon is flanked by two of her dragon-donkey hybrid babies that breathe fire at incoming witches.   Actually, there is a considerable amount of collecting in Shrek the Third. While exploring the levels and fighting off pirates, you must constantly be on the lookout for pick-ups like pixies and Shrek heads. Every stage has three Gingerbread Man pieces -- pick up the trio to earn an extra heart for Shrek's health bar. As you push into the second area, the Magical Forest, Gameloft starts hiding extras in alcoves or behind breakable blocks you'll only spot if you take the time to scout out every corner of the stage.   There is quite a bit to like about Shrek the Third, from the fantastic graphics to some clever platforming challenges. However, the game is too short. At only eight levels, Shrek the Third can be blazed through in just under an hour by a moderate player on medium difficulty. You can always play again to find any collectibles you missed during your first run through the game, but with the exception of the fun shooting action with Dragon, there aren't many absolutely compelling moments.   If you are going to tell a story in your mobile game, make the effort to tell a cohesive one. Spider-Man 3 recently suffered from this unfortunate phenomenon, and while Shrek is certainly a step up, I wish Gameloft had taken the extra step to flesh out the story. For example, at the end of one scene, Shrek is boarding a ship to go find the would-be King Arthur -- but the next time we join him, Shrek has already befriended Arthur. Where's the bridge?  Shrek the Third is a good game, especially for fans of classic side-scrolling platformers. Between bouncing off purple awnings in Far, Far Away to ducking under bouncing barrels thrown by pirates, Gameloft has created a nice homage to the halcyon days of the 8- and 16-bit genre. However, the game is just too short. Before you know, you're at stage eight and fighting off evil knights in the castle. After finishing the game in an hour, I was left wanting more. More Dragon shooting stages. More Puss making cute faces. More Donkey nosing cannonballs on-screen for me to throw. And that's why Shrek the Third is busted down to just being a good game, even though it has some great elements in it, such as the visuals and controls.But I'll tell you one thing that's for sure -- it's a hell of a lot better than that Shrek the Third demo on Xbox Live.
