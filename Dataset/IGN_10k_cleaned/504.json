They've killed South Park!!! I've been a fan of South Park since Cartman was Kenny, so it pains me to see how Acclaim has just taken a big dump on their South Park license with this faux game. Acclaim has never made any claims to being the premier PlayStation developer -- they're much better when dealing with more powerful, specialized hardware like the Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast. But even though they've faltered on the last couple of PlayStation titles, at least they tried to work the hardware and the license as best they could. However, Chef's Luv Shack is like a trip back to Acclaim circa 1997, around the time when they almost went bankrupt from bad handling of licenses. There are a few good ideas in this game, and they're all urinated on by poor implementation, rushed and sloppy programming, pathetic graphics and animation, intolerable load times, and slapdash mistreatment of the sound. On any other system, this game is marginally worth a rental. But on PlayStation, where we have 550 games to choose from, and more great ones coming our way every second of the Christmas season, this is inexcusable, and just outright worthless.   Gameplay? The idea behind this game was to make a game that would bring the ultimate party fun of Mario Party to PlayStation. Or, from Acclaim's perspective, to pilfer the approach and success of Mario Party, chuck the South Park kids into the mix, record some cursing and farting to get a mature rating so that they can pretend that it's true to the show, and (most importantly) get the thing out on the market for the Christmas rush before somebody does it well.   The game show approach was a rather novel idea. South Park's highest scorer Chef hosts his own cable access show, a trivia game with Double Dare-type challenges after every round. Questions in the game range from politics to polygamists to pot smokers, and everywhere in between, and they're all spun with irreverant, sophomoric bathroom humor. The mini-games are take-offs of classic arcade action games, so Asteroids is now Assteroids.  Too bad all that good thinking went to waste on piss-poor programming. For one thing, every second of Luv Shack is plagued by load times of biblical proportions. Every sequence requires a drawn out disc access (which is denoted by a generic CD loading symbol), so when you're playing this game, you may want to keep a shaver close by to trim the stubble that will grow between rounds.   It gets worse. The trivia questions are bad. Really bad. The writers behind the phenomenal You Don't Know Jack series supposedly helped out some in writing this game, but it's pretty obvious that their hearts weren't in this one. Questions mix South Park trivia and other nuggets of  pop culture useless knowledge. Occasionally the quiz questions are witty, such as in the one instance of this game that I hadn't blocked out of my head where Chef asks what a frag is. More often, much more often, they're stupid questions that either plumb the depths of stupidity or skim arcane factoids off almanacs. If you know the answer to a question, you'll hate yourself for knowing; If you don't know, you'll hate the game for asking. Of course, the game doesn't give the correct answer if you're wrong, so if some left-field query manages to spark your curiosity, you'll spend an eternity in purgatory never knowing the answer.   It gets worse. The mini-games are crafty take-offs of good arcade games, with South Park characters pasted over the original sprites, but they're all wrong for a party game. There are lots of games, but they're all races or simple point competitions that gamers might as well be playing alone, since there is no energy and no competitive essence. In Mario Party, games forced players in 2-on-2 team battles and even 3-on-1 slugfests that changed up the dynamics all the time and really made the party fun. The only equivalent of that fighting spirit is in the Tug Oh War, and even that's pretty bland. Most of the games are button mashers, which isn't terrible for a party game, but even the games that work well with the formula aren't much fun because they end too quickly before anybody can get into them. And then you have to watch another disc loading screen...  And it gets worse. The game was designed as a party game for two or more players, but apparently Acclaim didn't take in consideration that nobody would be able to sucker their friends into playing this thing. You can play single player, but there are no other opponents to take on, so the ~Big Multi-Player Luv-In~ suddenly becomes plain masturbation rather than the orgy it's supposed to be.  Graphics?  This game continues to embarrass the PlayStation with the graphics. While the South Park TV show isn't exactly Claude Monet, at least it has charm, animation, and pace. Luv Shack, on the other hand, is butt-ugly in ways that no other game has been butt-ugly before. The game make actual ass look attractive. Backgrounds in trivia sections are overly saturated and poorly designed (in keeping with the Cable Access game show theme, I guess, but it still looks like hell).There are never camera angle changes because the graphics are all shoddy 2D sprites that Acclaim could barely shoehorn into the PlayStation's memory (and even if you give them the excuse of being tethered by underpowered hardware, it's still a pitiful attempt). Characters are rough mock-ups of the South Park kids, and are so chunky and blurry that you'll mistake this game for a bad fan site running a homemade animated GIF. Animation is limited to perhaps six frames per character, and while the planning behind those half-dozen movements was well conceived to be minimalist and still clever, they're still not hardly enough. For instance, Chef's animations consist of him yanking his nipples (or jacket -- I wasn't sure which), knocking on the microphone like an 1940's comedian (most likely to tap out SOS signals to players who see him in this game), and shifting his eyes (to avert his vision from the travesty that is this game).   Mini-games fare a little better, but that's not saying much. These scenes capture the flavor of the show, and they are drawn and a little better than the main part of the game, but the South Park kids (the main draw of the game, mind you) are non-descript and pixelated still. In some games, they're a few pixels tall; in others, the game is a top down view that is at such an angle that you won't see anything to identify them but their snow beanie. On the show, the crude look was crisp and easy to see. Here, the look is just bad.  Sound?  The one place where Acclaim should have been hitting its stride, and instead it stumbles all over itself. The sound is so poorly recorded, sampled, and compressed that much of it is unintelligible. Sometimes words like ~dildo~ or ~F^!&ing S%*T~ [bleeped] rise out of the mix, but it's only because South Park fans are listening for them, and even then, they'll have to listen closely to figure out what was said. It's like everybody in the game is wearing Kenny's hood and speaking in mumbles. There are theme music cues to the show (and one of the game's few bright spots is the opening theme song), but the lack of music once the game is interrupted by the load time stutters the flow of the game. And the programming of the sound sequencing is so bad that the announcer often steps on Chef's lines. That's Issac Hayes, boy! Here's how the pitch went in the Acclaim office on this game: ~Hey boss, did you see that Nintendo's Mario Party is selling pretty well. Good reviews too...~ ~Great. Make one. Get it out by Christmas.~ Panicked, that guy went rummaging through Acclaim's vast collection of licenses, and after a few weeks of R&D with Jeremy McGrath party games (after getting nothing out of the Olsen twin design), he finally turned to his buddy down the hall and said, ~Hey, do we still have that South Park license?~ ~I dunno. Didn't we blow it last time?~ ~Yeah, but if still have it, this pile may actually sell.~The rest is game shame history. What's so terrible about this game is that it could have been mildly enjoyable had Acclaim not rushed it to stores without tuning or tweaking it in any way. The load times are unnecessary and pathetic, and never yield anything worthy in terms of gameplay or graphics or audio to justify that much loading. Mini-games are slightly fun (once they've loaded), but you can get this simple kind of gaming off of Shockrave, and even those games have better graphics. Acclaim considers this title the party game of the decade, but if I were you, I'd stick to bong hits and feeling up drunken co-eds.No stars. Joe Bob says check it out.", "date": "Dec 8, 1999"}
