Sitting in the comfort of your living room, a can of Stella by your feet, just doesn't hold quite the same appeal. There are advantages, obviously - your clothes don't end up smelling like stale beer and cigarettes and you won't be accosted by the local drunk asking what's the best way to hit the x20 multiplier (unless, of course, you happen to share a house with them). The pinball cognoscenti, however, will always sneer at even the most accurate videogame version of their favourite tables. Silly really, because Gottlieb Pinball Classics actually has a lot to offer.   For starters, some of the tables recreated in this compilation hark back almost 50 years and as such the only way to experience them first-hand is to play them here, unless of course you have the time and the money to track down a battered old original table and pay over the odds to have it restored. Secondly, there are a whopping 11 tables to choose from, all accurately modelled and boasting their original graphic designs and sound effects, so for less than 30 you get an entire arcade's worth of tables at your fingertips. Admittedly, if you don't like pinball in the first place then Gottlieb Classics has no place in your collection but, if you're an enthusiast desperate to sample the delights of long-forgotten tables, then it gets a lot of things right.    All the tables are laid out in a virtual arcade but only two are set to freeplay, meaning you have to notch up high scores on these to earn enough credits to progress to the other nine tables. Without credits you're stuck with playing Genie and Eldorado. Both are fairly modern and therefore have multiple flippers and big bonus multipliers, so even a novice pinball wizard can get their name on the high score table. However, you'll only earn credits by completing goals, whether it's reaching a certain score or completing different elements of the table - knocking drop targets in order, hitting ball traps and the like.   Controlling the table is simple enough with the nunchuk stick used to launch the ball and the Z and B triggers activating the left and right flippers. The flippers are pleasingly responsive, allowing for precision ball control - essential if want to learn the nuances of each table and really get the most out of the game. On that note, there's a handy instruction option that highlights the different features for each table, visually explaining the areas you need to focus on to build up precious multipliers. There's a surprising amount to each table, with Tee'd Off the most complex, boasting over 30 features to master.   In addition to the flippers, the table can be nudged by physically moving the controllers, jolting the nunchuk to tilt left and the Wii-mote to move right. Naturally the tilt alarm kicks in if you overuse it, which in turn disables the flippers, but by learning the subtle differences between the tables - some are more sensitive to tilting than others, just as in real life - you can really use it to your advantage, knocking the ball to the side before it disappears forever. On some of the tables, most notably Play Boy - a simple table in which the aim is to (somewhat randomly) land balls in holes that correspond with playing cards of different values - learning how to tilt effectively is essential, because it's really the only way of controlling the direction the ball goes in.    In fact, the variety provided by the different tables is one of the game's strong points. Some, like Big Shot and the bowling-alley themed Strikes n' Spares, are incredibly simple and can be picked up in seconds. Other tables, such as Eldorado and Black Hole - which has an additional table positioned beneath the main surface, reached by firing the ball up the correct chute - take longer to master but, as a result, are much more rewarding for the skilled player. There are two additional novelty games to play around with - the Love Meter and Xolten - which test your dating potential and predict your future respectively, but they're both completely random and are unlikely to hold your attention after a couple of tries.Ultimately, though, the amount of enjoyment you get out of Gottlieb Pinball Classics really does depend on how much you love knocking around a little silver ball. As an accurate, authentic pinball simulation, theres little to take offence at: the table selection is varied, although only half of them will really keep you hooked for any length of time.  The care and attention thats gone into making ball physics and the tables feel right is commendable too, and apart from the occasional hiccup  picking out the individual features on the Eldorado table is tough because the table design is so gaudy, although thats a fault with the original table itself rather than the game  Gottlieb gets it spot on.Sure, its by no means an epic game that deserves your Wii launch day savings more than Zelda, neither does it really make the most of the Wiis motion-sensitive controls (moving the flippers by flicking the controllers would have been a nice touch). But what it does  and thats recreate some of the most nostalgia-sparking pintables from the last 50 years  it does well.", "date": "Dec 7, 2006"}
