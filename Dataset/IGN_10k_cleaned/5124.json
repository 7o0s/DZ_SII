Last week, we downloaded Commando and gave it the weekend once-over, finding that just because something is old, doesn't necessarily make it a ~classic.~  Now, this week, we DL'd the old-school action-platformer Ghosts 'n Goblins which is indeed a classic in every sense of the word. But does this wireless rendition do justice to the venerable series, starring Arthur the valiant knight with keen underwear fashion sense?   Features:   Classic Capcom game  3 levels   For those that joined the series at Maximo, this is where it all started. Ghosts 'n Goblins is one of the first real character-driven action games. Starring Arthur, a knight dressed to the nines in the latest Camelot haute couture. Problem is, like any randy knight, he just can't keep his trousers on when the action heats up. One strike from an enemy zombie or demon and his armor falls to pieces, answering with finality the age old query, ~Boxers or briefs?~   Naturally, the most common handsets, such as the LG6000 just cannot fully emulate an NES classic. Corners must be cut, and the first thing Lavastorm trimmed was the number of levels. Now, Arthur must only conquer three evil realms to rescue a kidnapped princess. But trimming levels does not detract from the game's heralded difficulty. Ghosts 'n Goblins is still a challenging game, and the limitations of your handsets certainly don't help gloss over Arthur's travails.   When you begin the game, you have Arthur's default weapon: a lance. Spearing zombies is easy as you spring over gravestones. Pretty quickly, though, you'll be offered other weaponry like scorching torches. Not every weapon is created equal, and even though other gear may sound cool, there's certainly something to be said about the reliability of the lance. When it comes to swatting airborne demons to the dirt, you'll need a straight shooting weapon.   The three levels are full of bottom pits, ladders, and mucho bad guys. You'll give your thumb a real workout as you time jumps and lance throws to jab evildoers before they strip your of your armor plating. Lavastorm offers two control settings: regular and auto-fire. Do yourself a favor and ignore auto-fire. You're much better off having complete control over weapons tossing, especially in later levels when you need to time throws to clear out lines of enemies.   Ghosts 'n Goblins suffers visually from the jump. It's not a disaster by any means, but the loss in detail is noticeable and disappointing -- but it's impossible and unfair to fault Lavastorm for this. Face it, we're a dismal year or two behind the greatest in Japanese cellphone tech. They have handsets that could perfectly spit out an NES game. We do not. The game is pretty colorful, but the sprites and small and lacking in detail. Animation is also fairly limited. Also working against Ghosts 'n Goblins is real estate. Ghosts 'n Goblins was meant to be played on a television, not a vertically-oriented screen. As a result, you lose a great degree of foresight in spotting upcoming enemies.   At least Ghosts 'n Goblins manages to preserve one of the game's greatest assets: it's music. The soundtrack is still one of the best game scores ever written, and while this version is slightly stripped down, it's still rich and evokes great memories.Ghosts 'n Goblins is an excellent game, but the handset platform works against its timeless magic. Loss of visual real estate, loss of detail, and handset controls don't serve this classic very well. But even in the face of such difficulties, Ghosts 'n Goblins still succeeds. The three levels are full of enemies and platforming challenges -- and plenty of old-school charisma. Capcom and Lavastorm have done a good job bringing this classic to today's handsets, and I certainly hope that when we get the next round of phones that can handle NES games (and maybe even better), this game is revisited.", "date": "Oct 13, 2004"}
