No, no...that's not what I was supposed to say.  Actually, the real reason is since massively-multiplayer online RPGs are so, well, massive (heck, it's in the name) and since they require a good number of players to join on before they can realize their full potential, we like to give the community some time to build and for the game to take shape a bit. It's been a little over a month since we posted our first impressions of Anarchy Online, and now it's finally time for the full review that you've all been waiting for.  If you read our first impressions, you know we weren't so impressed with the state of the game back in July, and although it's apparent that Funcom is addressing most of the issues we had with the game, it's still a ways off from realizing its full potential.   In case you're not familiar with it, Anarchy Online is a science fiction-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game where you take on the persona of one of three rival factions -- Clan, Omni-Tek, and Neutral -- on the planet of Rubi-Ka.  I won't go into a lot of background information or a description of the game itself here since we've already given you a novel's worth of background and gameplay information in our preview, but if you're familiar with games like EverQuest, then you should have a good idea of how Anarchy Online plays.  Basically, you gain experience through your actions, after a certain number of experience points you gain a level, you gain points to distribute among your skills and attributes at each level, and that's how you develop your character.  There is no ultimate goal, there is no end (well, at least not until the four-year storyline is complete), and you're not the sole savior of the universe.  You are a player in an online world with thousands of other real-life players.  But enough of the introductory stuff, though...let's get right into what makes Anarchy Online simultaneously so brilliant yet so frustrating...  First off, as you can probably tell from the screenshots, Anarchy Online is by far the best-looking MMORPG to date.  The environments are, for the most part, incredibly detailed, and the texture-work in Anarchy Online is superb.  The art staff did a great job of capturing the look of what a futuristic landscape might look like.  Cities look like cities -- complete with a confusing maze of buildings, bridges, and shops -- and each has a style uniquely fitting for each of the factions.   As cool as the cities look, the outdoor areas are just as impressive; forests are full of trees, waterfalls are fully animated, weather effects such as dust and lightning storms are impressive, clouds look like real clouds, and sun rays shine brilliantly through to the ground.  Animation is smooth as well, and your character can perform dozens of fully-animated emotes  One of the biggest complaints of MMORPGs is that it can be pretty boring sitting around waiting to heal between the action.  All in all, because of certain nano-programs (the spells of Anarchy Online) and items such as medical kits, there's not as much downtime as in EverQuest, so the game keeps going.    Of course, banding together in a group and socializing is one of the major elements of any MMORPG, and Anarchy Online handles this aspect better than most.  You almost get penalized for grouping in other MMORPGs because you all have to split the experience points between your party.  AO takes a different approach, as you'll get a much larger percentage of experience points than just an equal split, making it extremely useful as well as rewarding to assemble in a party.  Game play itself is extremely open-ended, and this is one of the biggest strengths of the game.  You never feel locked into a role and you don't have to go through the game performing the same action over and over and over again.  The random mission generation system assures you plenty of options to progress through the game, which means you're not stuck in a combat role in order to gain experience or develop your character.  You're also not limited in your role-playing decisions simply because of your character's profession, and the developers designed it so the classes aren't as limiting as in most RPGs.  Just because you're a medic doesn't mean you can't learn computer programming.  Sure, it may be a little harder for you than your buddy the engineer, but that doesn't mean you can't try your hand at it.  This open-endedness also extends to the game world itself.  As you can imagine, Rubi-Ka is a big place. Don't like where you are?  Then jump on ~The Grid~ and travel to another area, or buy a hover-car and jet down the road.  Admittedly some of these options are only available to higher-level characters with developed skills and lots of credits, but it can be done.  Overall the game is a character development and item collector's dream.  As I kind of hit on earlier, you're not locked into a certain role with your character.  Although each profession has primary skills that they are better at than other classes, your bureaucrat or medic may be completely different from another bureaucrat or medic.  There are over 60 skills and attributes where you can distribute your skill points, so you have a lot of choice in shaping your character to your gameplay style, and I think it's something Funcom really did right.  You want people to tailor their characters how they want to, and too many limitations ends up making different characters of the same class mirror images of one another.    Adding to this personalized feel, there are literally thousands of items in the game, giving you even more choices as to what armor you wear, your weapon of choice, or what color chair you want in your apartment.  Yes, this may sound like a small point, but people like a sense of style to their characters, and the addition of a variety of items allows them to express themselves as an individual.  Admittedly at the higher levels it does seem that the armor choices are pretty limited to Bau and Waitte armor, but overall I was impressed by the thousands of items in the game, and of course Funcom will be adding more in the future.  I was also impressed with the barter and auction system in Anarchy Online.  Selling your hard-earned items in MMORPGs can be a real bitch because you have to give a shout out and invariably get asked questions like ~How much damage does it do~ or ~What's the armor class?~  Anarchy Online solves that with a feature that lets you make a reference to the auctioned item so other players simply have to click on a link to see all of an item's stats, making it much easier to transfer item information.  However, as pretty as it looks and as brilliant as some of the ideas and concepts in the game are, Anarchy Online is a far cry from being perfect.  The most problematic of the hitches is that the game is still plagued by a myriad of technical issues at this point.  Anarchy Online suffers from what hampers every online game -- lag and latency.  Moving in the crowded urban areas is an often laborious affair, and although the frame rates are higher and the ping rates are more stable than they were a month ago, running around the city is often like running through a strobe light, as your character will jump around the landscape as the game tries to catch up with your location.  Lag can also plague you in combat, and this is when it's the most dangerous.  It can literally take a couple of minutes for the game to catch up with you and register what has happened to your character in the middle of combat, and I would often come out of a fight only to find that I had already died.  Yes, it's frustrating to say the least.  I'm also still experiencing a fair number of crashes that kick me out of the game, although a few weeks ago I wasn't having as many problems as I am now, and they seem to stem from a recent patch that may have done more harm than good, at least for me.  Another problem lies in the skill system.  Although there are plenty of skills, many of them are pretty useless or not even implemented at this point in the game.  For example, I spent a few points climbing early on, but I have yet to find anything to climb.  Also, with the exception of one or two, the trade skills are not yet implemented in the game.  While the graphics are tight, there are plenty of graphical errors that detract from the game.  The most glaring of these are the frequent clipping problems and the fact that the walls aren't always ~solid.~  One of the most exploitable bugs in the game is the fact that you can shoot through walls.  This can be a good and bad thing, as you can shoot things far afar that can't see you, but it can be bad since you can also be shot at and have no idea what is pegging you.  For a game this complex, I wish Funcom would have included a thicker manual, or at least skipped all the background stuff and put some more hardcore gameplay information in the manual.  You're just kind of left to feel through the game yourself or visit any number of sites dedicated to the game, including our very-own Anarchy Online Vault, to find out basic information as to how a particular item functions.  Whew...I could literally go on for hours and hours for a game as big and deep as Anarchy Online, but I'll spare you.  I think you get the gist of it by now...it's a brilliant, engaging, profound MMORPG, but with enough atrocious technical problems to make you scream more obscenities than a French truck driver.  This game has the potential to be the best MMORPG ever, and I've seen it work right in the beta phases, so I know what it can do once the technical issues are fixed.  Unfortunately, we can't review a game based on ~potential~ -- we have to review it based on the facts, and the facts are that Anarchy Online simply isn't up to spec right now because of a few major bugs that still need to be worked out of the system.  However, with that said, it has gotten better since our first impressions, and with 60,000 active AO account as of this writing, it seems that many of the early adopters are having a great time with the game.  I have no doubt that Anarchy Online will live up to its potential in a few more months after the initial growing pains are over.  However, I would still recommend waiting a few months for Funcom to work on the bugs and get more servers online, especially since you'll be paying $12.95 a month to play the game.    -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
