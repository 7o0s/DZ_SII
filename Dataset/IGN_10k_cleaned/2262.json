The latest Sega game, brought to PlayStation 2 owners by Acclaim Entertainment, is 18-Wheeler American Pro Trucker, a racing game based entirely on driving and you guessed it 18-wheel truck from point A to point B.   Now you might ask, what the hell would anyone go and do that for? And how can that be so much fun? Sega can answer both, A) it's fun, and B) because you get to drive an 18-wheeler. Kind of a cyclical philosophy, isn't it? But that's what's going on here.   Gameplay  Anyway, enough philosophy already. In a strange deal that Acclaim set up with Sega long ago, Acclaim is delivering three Sega games to the US, including the already published Crazy Taxi, 18-Wheeler, and Vampire Night. 18-Wheeler is essentially a PS2 version of the Dreamcast game, which had some extras over the arcade version, and it's essentially a nearly perfect port of the arcade version at that.   The PS2 game the includes all the modes from the Dreamcast title. Arcade, Versus, Point Challenge, and Parking, plus a nice little official support for the Driving Force Racing Wheel, the Logitech steering wheel that worked so well with Gran Turismo 3 A-spec.   And it's on that last topic, steering wheels, which we must discuss first and foremost. The great attraction of the arcade game by the same name was the arcade unit itself, the seat, the big screen, the stick shift, and more than anything else, the big fat trucker's steering wheel. The steering wheel screamed for attention; just looking at the arcade unit was enough to walk over and ogle at the fancy, Americana-style coin-op unit. But it's the steering wheel, it's size, and the feedback, that made the game so desirable to play. SO, naturally, the home unit on PS2 doesn't have the honking steering wheel, and so despite what normally say about gameplay first and foremost, 18-Wheeler just isn't the same game without it. It's not as clunky, or as physically challenging.    But hey, you can't have everything. Or can you? Acclaim has done something good. It has brought in-game support for the Driving Force Racing Wheel, which mimics the arcade-unit as best a home unit can. It's not the same, but it's a close third. For those who already own the steering wheel from having played GT3, well than, heck partner! There's no reason you shouldn't give this bucking bronco a try!   Now, in regard to the actual gameplay, 18-Wheeler is an absolutely simplistic, straightforward game. In the game's best mode, Arcade, players pick from four truckers and their trucks, and they start racing against the clock. The game is to make the checkpoints before time runs out, and key factors in doing such things include slipstreaming behind your opponent (a destructive, bad-tempered one) for maximum speed, avoiding obstacles, such as moving cars, and conversely, aiming for cars with Time Bonus signs above their roofs. Made the checkpoints and you win.   Now, granted, there isn't too much strategy here, but it's important to note that the trucks all handle awkwardly and begrudgingly, and they're slow as molasses, too. (Remember, they're trucks.) Making the checkpoints isn't easy at first, believe it or not, and knowing the courses, hitting every slipstreaming chance available, and smashing the time bonus cars are all crucial. I had to play though the first race about seven times just to make the first checkpoint. There's a little bit of rhythm required, a tad bit of skill, and some timing and luck that are needed to win, too. In short, it's an arcade game, and a good one at that.    My other favorite mode is Parking. I mean, come on, parking? That's a mode? How whacked is that Naturally, it's great fun. Parking mode requires more skill than Arcade mode. The object is simple enough parking the truck but against time and obstacles, it's once again a bizarre idea that's carried off amazingly well. It's fun, challenging, and genuinely one-of-a-kind.   But let's not get carried away, 18-Wheeler is one of those arcade games that probably should have stayed in the arcades. Yes, it's zany and fun, yes it's unique, but let me tell you, I beat the Arcade mode in less than one hour (it's only got four tracks, folks, just like in the arcade). Yes, indeed, and I beat the Parking mode in the next 35 minutes. The Point Attack is relatively boring, and then there's two-player, which is very blase, so for me, the game lasted less than two hours. I mean, I was done with it in two short hours  maximum. To say 18-Wheeler is short is the understatement of the year.   Graphics  Not one for wowing the fans with stunning, next-generation textures and graphics, Sega/Acclaim's 18-Wheeler is decent looking at best, with no special areas worth mentioning.   The inside view (there are two inside and outside) provides a nice look at a trucker's cabin, with a wide windshield, funny dangly tings hanging from the rearview mirror, and a nice big-ass dashboard.   The game looks entirely average, even given the background fade-ins, and problems with flickering. What's mostly entertaining about the graphics are the topics. You know, Sega's impression of what the US looks like, from a Japanese developer point of view. The backgrounds include lots of freeways, and square cars, but there are all sorts of shacks and winding country roads, and wide-open plains, too. The Americana is about as visually interesting as the game gets, which isn't saying much.   Sound  Honk honk! Here comes my 18-wheeler! Move out of my way, Green horn! That's just a little sample of the witty banter that 18-Wheeler throws your way. It's crazy! Well, not really. I just can't get the Crazy Taxi sound riff out of my head (It's crazy money!).   What can I really say here? That the trucks sound awesome, and the gear shifting is exactly like the real thing? Well, these things are mostly true (I haven't been sampling any 18-wheeler sounds recently, but I'll get back to you when I do...), and the trucks sound great, as far as that kind of thing goes.Acclaim's 18-Wheeler American Pro Trucker, at best, is a rental game that may last you about two hours maximum. If you happen to have a friend who loves racing trucks, and 18-wheelers at that, well then, you might eke out another two hours, totaling four whopping hours of pure trucking goodness from this port, but I'm just a little doubtful on that end. I reckon, you should rent this game, and then play it for all its worth, all of its glorious 18-wheeler bliss (all two-plus hours), and then get on with your life.", "date": "Nov 14, 2001"}
