{"name": "Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels", "name_review": "Space Hulk", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/space-hulk", "text": "Most first-person shooters follow pretty much the same pattern: roam around corridors and rooms and blast whatever gets in your way. Some games, like King's Field and Jumping Flash!, put some well deserved spin on the tired genre. Space Hulk thankfully does as well.  Based on the Games Workshop board game of the same name, and set in the Warhammer universe, Space Hulk puts you in command of an entire squad of mechs, not just the usual one. Each soldier can be issued orders separately, or you can control them directly. This is especially helpful - having someone watch your back can be the deciding factor between life and death.  The graphics are nice, although the control can be a little sticky, especially when navigating those tight corridors. The 'mechs also move a little slow, but then what did you expect from big, metal suits? Overall, Space Hulk is a solid title and, while not exactly the most original game ever made, is still great fun.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
