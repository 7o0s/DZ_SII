Unlike Pack-In Soft's mixture of RPG and arcade-style fishing, Rockstar's In-Fisherman Bass Hunter 64 takes the route of a fishing simulation and concentrates squarely on realism. Players used to the quick and easy Zelda-style fishing game will have to invest some serious time into learning the little tricks and nuances of fishing to really enjoy this game. But once you figure it out, Bass Hunter will definitely have you hooked.Features Licensed by In-Fisherman. Expert advice from In-Fisherman's host Al Lindner. Geographically accurate fishing locations. Lure Cam lets players see what's happening underwater. Varying light and weather conditions. Wide selection of popular, licensed lures and tackle. Hundreds of rod, reel and artificial bait combinations. Virtual Ranger Bass Boats with Electronic Fish Finders. Feel nibbles and strikes through Rumble Pak support. Three difficulty settings) Built-in EEPROM for Controller Pak-less saving (three separate saves).GameplayPlayers select from two modes, Championship Fishing and Fishing For Fun. The heart of the game is of course the Championship mode, that has players compete in timed fishing championships. In a quick (text-only) briefing, players are given their objectives, their fishing location, and a look at the light, lake and weather conditions. Seasons range from pre-summer to post-spawn and water conditions vary from stained and warm to clear and cool. These parameters all affect where in the lake players will find the fish during the championships. Information sheets supplied by In-Fisherman host Al Lindner give rookie bass fishers clues as to where look for the biggest bass.Using Ranger Bass Boats, players then cruise the lake and use an electronic fish finder to locate the biggest bass. Although they're only meant to be a means of transportation, the boat physics and controls are actually pretty cool. We couldn't resist putting the throttle on high and tearing up the lake. Sadly, a few invisible barriers spoil the fun once in while.Once you find the best fishing spot, you stop the boat and start to fish using a selection of rods, reels, top water lures, spinners, tackles and of course bait combinations. One of the best things about Bass Hunter is that its makers put a lot of effort into making the experience as authentic. Instead of the usual generic gear you'll find in other fishing games, players have access to fully licensed equipment from Berkeley, Strike King, Blue Fox, Heddon, Rapala, Arbogast, Snag Proof, Excalibur, Bagley, Rat-L-Trap, Zorro Bait Co, Spidercast, Mitchell, Ranger and more. From Snag Proof Moss Mice to Heddon Zarra Spook Top Water lures -- fishing aficionados won't be disappointed.The actual fishing engine is sound as well. Performing overhand or skip casts with the analog stick (up/down adjusts pitch) is very straightforward and doesn't really take any skill to master -- but hooking the more sizable bass in the lake is a challenge that only few players can meet. Once the bait is cast, the screen split horizontally, showing your fisherman/woman of choice at the top and -- depending on your choice of lure -- an underwater or surface view of the lake. If you've got a Rumble Pak equipped (and we strongly suggest you'll do so), you will feel the fish nibbling at the bait. If you're too impatient, you'll scare it away, so be sure to wait till it bites until you set the hook. Time penalties are given for lure changes or for letting a fish go.Reeling in the catch is not as simple as in games like Zelda or Legend of the River King. The fish use the 3D environments to the max and try to escape into all directions (unlike in Zelda, where the fish usually only pull away from Link). Adjusting line tension with the help of the C Buttons is important as too much tension can cause your line to snap, but too little tension won't help you much, either. Developer GearHead struck a good balance, making the game a rewarding experience for fishing fans, but keeping it accessible to beginners as well. After the tournament, players can visit the bait shop and buy new equipment, including tackles, rods, lures and even new boats.GraphicsGraphically, Bass Hunter beats both THQ's Bassmasters and Natsume River King for the most part. While the fish are nowhere near as well-animated and lifelike as in River King, the environments, based on real locations like Lake Arthur, Lake Butler or Lake Palmer, are nicely modeled. Atmospheric effects like rain and morning fog enhance the experience and make for one of the best-looking console fishing games yet (Dreamcast fishing excluded, of course). On the downside, the underwater views could be a lot better (River King again leads the pack here) and framerates tend to drop a bit when the split screen is active. The game could have also used a bit more glitz in the presentation department, but the full 3D environments easily make up for those shortcomings.SoundThe reel sounds and boat engines all sound like the real thing, but the uninspired music will have most players looking for the mute button in the options menu. Luckily, the repetitive tunes can easily be switched off. Overall, the game could have used a lot more sound effects (water splashes, underwater glub-glub sounds and the like) and doesn't deliver copious amounts of voice narration and commentary like THQ's title.I can't say that I'm a die-hard fishing fan, but this game's pretty darn cool. Since it focuses on bass fishing, you won't find the same impressive fish variety as in Pack-In's (Japan-only) Legend of the River King -- but being able to navigate fully-3D lakes and purchase (licensed) equipment makes this game feel much more real. However, as good as the fishing engine is, there is still room for improvement (I'd prefer more complex casting mechanics, for example). Sadly, like River King, Bass Hunter doesn't have a two-player competition mode, making the game a purely solitary experience. If you're into fishing, you definitely shouldn't miss out on this impressive first N64 title from GearHead. Everyone else, give it a rent -- who knows, perhaps you'll be hooked, too.", "date": "Jul 31, 1999"}
