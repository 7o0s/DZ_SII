Yep, it's true. World Driver Championship, Midway and Boss Game Studios' third N64 collaboration, is the 28th racing game for the console, not counting the N64's colorful assortment of snowboarding and combat games. Luckily, by combining sim-style racing with a healthy dose of arcade gameplay, World Driver Championship manages to carve itself its own niche on the N64.Features Team/sponsor-based racing with 15 different teams. Championship, Arcade Race, Time Attack and Training modes. More than 30 different, unlicensed cars (based on real vehicles). 10 tracks with three variations each (plus backwards and mirror tracks). 20 different racing events, ranging from multi-track championships to endurance races. Semi-realistic physics model with four-point suspension system. ~Ghost~ races. Distinct engine noises for all cars (for both inside and outside the car views). Automatic and manual transmissions. Detailed polygonal track graphics and car models. Specular highlighting and reflections. Standard and hi-res letterbox modes. Replay mode plays back the whole race and replays can even be saved to the Controller Pak. Controller Pak and Rumble Pak support.GameplayWith most racing games on the N64 taking the high-flying arcade approach to the genre, gamers looking for a driving simulator closer to Sony's Gran Turismo had to make do with either NASCAR or Formula 1-themed titles -- until now. Don't get us wrong, with its unlicensed cars and powerslide-heavy driving physics, World Driver is definitely not meant to be a straight Gran Turismo clone for the N64. While it has a lot in common with Gran Turismo in both graphics and its approach to true representation of speed, World Driver is a completely different game with a consequently different physics engine and overall approach. Instead of focusing on car customization and garage work, World Driver's Championship mode casts players in the role of a career driver, out to get his hands on the coolest ride under the sun and go into the record books as the best racer ever.Players enter their names and are immediately debriefed by two GT2 racing teams, Kohr and Speedcraft -- both want you to take their cars to victory. It's up to you whether you want to go with a '96 Rage 512 (a Porsche 911 lookalike) or an overly heavy '97 Stallion SR C (looks like a Ford Mustang). At this point, you can also check out some of the other racing teams, like Viewpoint, Reeds, Eurospec, Totalsport or Elite and look at their cars. However, since you're an unknown driver, those teams won't even consider you as a choice to drive their precious vehicles.The game features more than 30 different cars, each with their own variations of control, acceleration and overall speed. Depending on what car one is using, control changes significantly. Like in Gran Turismo, you start off with fairly slow cars and need to work yourself up to the faster ones to really get the most out of WDC. This is definitely not the right game for people with short attention spans! As a matter of fact, driving the earlier, heavy cars will feel a bit awkward at first, as only correctly timed braking and downshifting will prevent you from crashing into walls or spinning out on sand patches and losing precious time. That said, focus testing should have revealed that many gamers prefer less ~slidey~ physics, even if the later cars improve significantly. Once you unlock the more powerful cars and move into the GT1 vehicle class (tap R to switch back between the leagues), the game really starts to fly. If you're good enough, you will eventually get to Excalibur's Mystic (shown on the game's box) -- a car that's almost too fast to make it through the track in one piece.Although the WDC doesn't feature official car licenses like Gran Turismo or V-Rally, most of the cars in the game are based on real-life GT racers, including those by Ford, Porsche, Lotus, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Dodge, Mercedes, and more.Once you decide on your car of choice (after a quick test drive, most likely), you join the racing team and enlist in one of the available racing events. In the beginning, only few will be available, but as you progress through the championships and accumulate race points, new challenges will open up, including Drivers Challenge cups or endurance races. A qualification round before the actual races determines the player's start position on the grid.The different events are made up of up to six of the 10 tracks in the game. Although World Driver's 10 completely distinct courses are already more than most Nintendo 64 racers out there have to offer, Boss also created three variations of each track and even lets you race them backwards and mirrored. The following tracks are in the game: Les Gets: A slightly more slippery track somewhere in the snowy mountains. Patches of fog make judging the road ahead more difficult. Hawaii: A curvy track on the tropical island, set under a beautiful evening sky. Tight tunnel turns require plenty of brake work. Las Vegas: A night race through the streets and tunnels of Las Vegas. Neon galore. Be sure to look for familiar landmarks. Everything is where it should be. New Zealand: Fast speed track in the fall countryside of New Zealand. Tough S-curve. Lisbon: The early morning sun will occasionally blind drivers on their race through Portugal's capital's high speed track. A visual masterpiece. Rome: Race by the Roman ruins and tear up the streets of Italy's premier city. Once you get good, you should only tap the brakes in one single turn. Sydney: The red hills of Australia are ideal to show all your car's got. A short peek at famous Sydney's opera house is included. Zurich: A race under Switzerland's blue sky takes you from the historic ~Altstadt~ right to the airport. Tough curves and changing track surfaces. Kyoto: A stormy evening in Japan's ancient city. The twilight makes it hard to see the road far ahead. Get good at skidding around the 90 degree turns WITHOUT slamming into the walls. Black Forest: Hitch a ride on the Autobahn through Germany's scenic forests. No speed limits here, baby, but nasty sand patches can screw up your racing line.One of the potential problems amateur gamers will encounter is that WDC has the steepest learning curve out of all N64 racing games -- despite the initially slow cars. Getting used to the over-the-top powerslides will take a while (remember to downshift when going into tough turns -- or, if you're using automatic gearshift, hold the brake button to force your car to shift). Unlike most other racers, WDC is all about racing in a ~pack~, battling it out with other drivers. Getting pushed onto a sand patch or spinning out due to driving errors (watch out for slippery curbs) can easily cost you your pole position, so defensive driving is essential with the slower cars -- although using other cars as ~slide blocks~ to help you skid through a turn can be very satisfying.Sometimes, it's almost impossible to score a #1 victory for a race with a given car. At that point, it's best to gather racing points by beating an easier circuit and getting a car better suited for the tougher tracks. This long-time play value and high level of challenge will no doubt please veteran race fans who manage to blaze through every other N64 racing game in a few hours.Any track or car opened up in the Championship mode can also be raced in the game's Time Trials, Quick Races and Two-player vs. Modes. Boss Game even thought of a ghost race mode that lets players compete against course ghosts or their own best races that can also be saved to a memory pak (along with the course records and options). The smooth two-player mode is excellent and a true step ahead of Boss Game's Top Gear Rally. Not only can you switch on additional computer-controlled drones, you can also toggle on or off the infamous ~catch-up logic~ option (which is turned to OFF during the Championship mode, by the way) and watch the whole race in a gorgeous full-screen replay. Smack-talking during the replay while pointing out your opponent's driving mistakes is of course essential to the enjoyment of the two-player mode.GraphicsThere is no denying that World Driver looks absolutely stunning. The spectacular graphics engine, which only occasionally slows down (ie when all eight (!) cars are on screen at once or in crowded curves), runs in two different resolutions depending on preference. A 320x240 mode is, of course, the standard, but the game can also be played in a true hi-res letterbox mode that does not need the 4MB Expansion to work but also runs a little slower. We suggest sticking with the full-screen mode during both gameplay and replays.The thoroughly designed tracks are all filled with miniscule details that other racers miss. One interesting example is a positional fogging system, which really does use fogging only for effect and not to eliminate pop-up. Les Gets, for example, is perfectly clear at points and overcast with a sheet of thin, translucent fog at others. It's a minor detail that makes a big difference in the realism department. World Driver's Las Vegas track actually looks like Vegas, with all the right buildings (names and signs are of course changed to protect the innocent) and huge skyscrapers and glitzy lights fill the scene. Kyoto features dark, gloomy clouds and a very stylized, yet realistic backdrop with Japanese road signs and neon ads. There's even a Yodobashi Camera store for gamers who can read Japanese... Other levels feature sunsets with one of the most impressive lens flares we've seen to date and certainly the best yet for Nintendo 64.Vehicle models have a high poly-count and look just as good if not considerably better than those in Gran Turismo. Even better, eight of them are on track at the same time. Each model boasts (fake) reflection mapping, light-sourcing and four-point physics for tire suspension. To really show off the cars and tracks in all their glory, Boss added an amazing replay mode (up to 15 laps can be cached in the single-player mode/five in the two-player mode and even saved to a controller pak!). Dynamic cameras follow the car as it makes its laps and creates the most cinematic replays yet. One of our favorite cameras shoots the vehicle from a slanted angle so that it looks as if it's driving straight up (or down) a street. Another camera pans by the vehicle going to the opposite direction so that the car appears to be accelerating at twice its normal speed. Brilliant.SoundTwisted Edge's Zack Ohren returns to deliver more funky guitar riffs. The energetic sound track isn't bad and the samples are very impressive for a cartridge game (thanks to careful stereo placement), but the songs are far too short and tend to get old quickly. We also would have liked a bit more variety and perhaps songs that actually fit to the respective tracks. Of course, you can easily turn off the music and listen to the game's sound effects only (and perhaps play one of your own CDs instead). Without the music, the game even adds a few more sound channels to handle the drones' engine sounds, so the sound effects actually improve when you switch it off.The engine sounds are varied and sound good and there are plenty of different road noises that depend on the track surfaces. Driving over a metal grid will trigger the corresponding sound and your car's tires will audibly react to cobble stone or track markings with the right effects. Cool. Collision sounds are also a step up from Boss's previous efforts, although it sounds like they come a tad too late at times. Repetitive music aside, our only real complaint is that there's some crackling ~noise~ in some of the sound samples. Nice positional sounds, such as windmills, church bells and crickets easily make up for this minor flaw.Peripheral SupportIt's true: WDC doesn't support the RAM Expansion, and there's a reason for it. While it can fix memory issues, the extra 4MBs of RAM are not a magic fix for the N64's polygon or processor limitations. As evident by the gorgeous and detailed tracks in the game, WDC is using the hardware's fill rate to the max -- RAM is not the issue. As a matter of fact, the programmers should be commended for writing an engine that leaves plenty of space for caching replay data -- even a full 15-lap race.However, the game does support both Controller Pak and Rumble Pak. A saved game takes up only 11 pages, but you need of course a full pak if you want to save all your replay data. The Rumble Pak is put to use rather well -- not only do you feel the impacts, but Italy's cobble stone patches will make your controller shake as well. No dedicated steering wheel support.I love this game, despite the fact that it can be quite frustrating at times. The racing in World Driver Championship isn't the same outrageous no-brakes fun of say, Beetle Adventure Racing or Top Gear Overdrive. Instead, players must watch their speeds when going into sharp curves and downshift to make it through without losing too much speed. If you go too fast, the car will naturally begin to slide. It's up to the player to keep things under control and -- especially for beginners -- it's not as easy as one might think it would be. You WILL spin out in the beginning. Stick with the game and advance to get lighter and faster cars and you will discover one of the most rewarding racers on the N64.The sense of speed may initially seem a bit low to some people (one category where the game seems to be directly modeled after Gran Turismo) due to the high placement of the camera in the third-person mode and the realistic speed settings. I usually play in the first person mode (bumper cam), so I really can't complain about a lack of speed. Be aware though that the frustration factor can be quite high due to spin outs and tough track design -- but the impending doom of crashing into a barricade makes for some pretty tense races. It would have been nice if Boss had also thought of implementing car damage and added even more depth by letting drivers customize their car settings and add new parts. But even without garage work, there's plenty of replay value thanks to the many cars, tons of track variations and solid two-player mode. Unlocking all the cars isn't easy (especially since one team won't give you its better cars unless you remain completely faithful and don't switch partners) and will keep you occupied for a long time.The near perfect Gran Turismo for PlayStation still remains my favorite car racer on any platform, but World Driver is a welcome distraction in a genre overpopulated with stale paint-by-numbers racers. This is definitely not the right game for people with short attention spans -- but a well-crafted title for car fans and gamers looking for a long-lasting gameplay experience. I played it every day for the past two weeks, much to the chagrin of my wife -- and I still come back for the two-player mode. Buy it.", "date": "Jun 17, 1999"}
