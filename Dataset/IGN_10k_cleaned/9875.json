Don't worry though, it's easy enough to understand: you're a shape on a grid, surrounded by other - bad - shapes and they need to be shot. Skittish green squares, spinning purple triangles and docile blue rhombuses alike explode in sparks before your space-guns. The screen fills with increasing numbers of enemies and you lose all track of what's going on, racking up massive points before you explode as well. This is arcade gaming at its purest.   Screenshots don't do the constant, chaotic visual carnage justice.  What makes Geometry Wars great is its combination of striking visual design and chaotic, addictive score-chasing gameplay, perfectly complemented by the thumping space-techno audio backdrop. It's all too easy to slip into 'the zone', at one with your tiny ship as the odds stack up against it. Each distinct type of enemy behaves differently; some split into smaller shapes when shot, some creatively avoid bullets and, occasionally, black holes appear that warp the gravity around them, consuming anything nearby before exploding in a rush of new and dangerous shapes. It's a very aesthetic experience  zipping around shooting at shapes is all well and good, but it's the creativity evident in the different enemies and sheer vivid, visual impact of the presentation that has made Geometry Wars such a cult hit.   Geometry Wars: Galaxies is a much-expanded version of the original Xbox game, with a plethora of new enemies and other content to justify its release as a full, boxed console title (and a good-value one too, at 25 for the Wii version). Instead of comprising one, never-ending level as Retro Evolved did, Galaxies is split up over more than 60 different planets, each of which has a slightly different take on the Geometry Wars concept. One might include nothing but a single special type of new enemy or play out in an oddly-shaped arena that makes it easy to trap yourself. Things like moving barriers, a huge variety of enemy and arena designs and the need to constantly adapt your playing style between levels means that Galaxies is much more varied than we expected. At the basest level, you're always just flying and shooting, but Galaxies takes that simple concept about as far as it can go.   That's you in the middle there. Make the most of the down time.  As always, it's about surviving as long as possible on each life in order to maximise your score by keeping your multiplier going. Unlike previous versions though, your multiplier isn't automatically calculated  you're in control of it. Exploded enemies leave Geoms behind  tiny dots worth anything from a +1 to a +10 on your multiplier  don't grab them and your multiplier won't increase, meaning you'll be there an awfully long time if you want a gold medal. This adds a brilliant daredevil twist to the game as flying to collect Geoms usually puts you in mortal danger  it forces you to take risks, and makes it all the more exciting.   Geoms are also used to buy in-game items - including new galaxies, new planets and new upgrades for your drone - offering a reason to replay levels and continue collecting them well after you reach the maximum 150x multiplier. Your drone  a wee circular thingy that follows you around the screen (and that you'll automatically try to shoot for the first half-hour) can do various helpful things like collect geoms, attack enemies or turn itself into a gun turret to protect you from danger, and its different abilities level up the more you play with them. At first, the drone is a pretty incompetent dot but, later on, it becomes a strategically essential dot. Ingenious.     Then, of course, there are the controls. Two options are available for Wii players: ordinary dual-analogue-stick for owners of the Classic Controller (weirdly, it doesn't seem to work with the GameCube one), and the more exciting option of using the nunchuck for movement and the Wii remote for pointing and shooting. Now, we know that sounds unnecessarily finicky and complex, but it isn't. Using the Wii remote to determine your shooting angle feels natural after only a few minutes; developer Kuju has managed to take a very traditional type of game and make it work well with the most untraditional of control systems, which is quite an achievement.   In terms of multiplayer, the Wii's offline options aren't quite as expansive as its DS sibling's, but the inclusion of co-op play is definitely welcome. You can play through a few of the galaxies together, or co-operate in the never-ending Retro Evolved mode for an ultimate new high-score. Meanwhile, Versus mode, also based on Retro Evolved, is a simple quest for the highest score  it stops being a fight for survival and becomes a quick-reactions battle to topple enemies before your opponent does.   Different shaped arenas throw up new challenges. Geometry Wars is a great arcade shooter that manages to feel very modern in spite of its old-fashioned gameplay. Galaxies introduces a lot of variety and goal-setting to the game that won us over in its Xbox 360 form, which is itself included as an optional extra for purists. Its difficult to see how the concept could possibly be expanded further.Trying to decide between DS and Wii? Go for the Wii version, as a good chunk of Geometry Wars appeal comes from ogling the bewildering chaos on-screen, being unable to count the brightly-coloured spinning enemies exploding against the undulating background. For just a fiver more, the graphically gorgeous Wii version is the more sensible option, especially as the two games have exactly the same single-player content  and it also has the option of using the Classic Controller.", "date": "Jan 18, 2008"}
