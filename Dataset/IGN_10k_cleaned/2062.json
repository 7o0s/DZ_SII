Exceptions will be granted on a case-by-case basis to developers and publishers who submit a compelling argument to the contrary -- for example, Koei has our blessing to bring Yanya Caballista to the States -- but as a rule, this control will be enforced unmercifully.  Several attempts have been made to make a game as good as the original Tony Hawk, and none of them have provided anything close to a worthwhile alternative, while Neversoft's games have advanced by leaps and bounds. As such, it's time to stop cluttering the market.  Today's case in point is ESPN X Games Skateboarding, which in the face of Tony Hawk 3's impending arrival has a license and nothing else to recommend it.  It's impeccably presented, thanks to the ESPN license's contribution and some very nice work on the part of those who designed and programmed the interface, but once you make it out of the menu system, the fun more or less goes away.  X Games features moderate to severe engine difficulties, some very questionable decisions as far as structure and level design, and an unpleasantly stiff control scheme that doesn't actually offer much more in terms of trick potential than the original Tony Hawk.  Wait a couple of months and you'll play a game that eclipses this as Chad Fernandez's double front-foot impossible does my feeble attempts to ollie over the mushroom couches in the office (result: severe rug-burn to both knees).  Presentation  To begin with, the nice bits: ESPN X Games Skateboarding features a superb interface and all kinds of cool presentation elements drawn from the TV programs it's based on.  The competition levels feature all the keen transitions and overlays, so you see your skater announced in sharp postmodern fashion before every run, and his score tallied up with the rest of the competition afterward.  As far as original creations go, the menus where you pick your board and skater are first-rate, with 3D previews for everything that reflect changes in clothing, wheels, trucks, and the like.  The deck preview is just beautiful, letting you rotate the board in real time and admire the snappy graphics (World Industries, the game's leading deck sponsor, has always been a favorite of mine).  Graphics  But then you get out of the menus and into the game, and things take a bit of a dip.  X Games' graphics engine is better than the first arcade level would make you think, but that's not saying much. To explain, nobody told the level designers to lead with their strengths, so the first stage (Los Angeles) is small, badly designed, and afflicted by hideous aliasing, draw-in, resolution fluctuations, and slowdown. It looks genuinely awful.  After that, for some reason, everything settles down into a more pleasing sort of groove, and the later Museum and Passenger Liner levels show some flashes of genuine visual invention, even if the level design leaves a lot to be desired as far as gameplay is concerned (more on that later).  The giant grindable dinosaur skeletons in the Museum level are great fun to play around with, and very nicely modeled -- that's one of the better-looking levels in general, mainly thanks to the smaller, enclosed spaces.  It doesn't have the texture detail of something like San Francisco, but it holds together technically with far fewer problems.  In outdoor levels, especially the LA and San Francisco stages, draw-in is a minor to major annoyance, with big chunks of architecture in the not-too-far distance fading in with very little fog to ease the transition.  Every level is pretty severely aliased, resulting in the jagged, shiny over-sharp look of games like City Crisis.  That issue is thrown into sharp relief when the game does the NASCAR 2001 resolution-drop, but luckily that only happens with any frequency in the LA level, ditto the occasional slowdown.  If anybody has an explanation for why the smallest, simplest, and earliest stage is the one with the least polish, I'd love to hear it...  As for the riders, they're a step up from what we've seen on the PlayStation, but the redone skaters in Tony Hawk 3 are still a cut above.  The transition and idle animations in ESPN are still pretty stiff, save for the inclusion of a few nice fluttering-cloth effects that give away the engine's kinship with Osaka's snowboarding game.  I do like the deck animation, though, even the little blur-trail effect that shows off the movement of the board through flip tricks.  The boards are nicely modeled with very sharp deck graphics, and it's fun to see them spinning so neatly in the replays.  Gameplay  Essentially, every good idea in this game was nicked from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.  What is original here as far as game design is concerned is also frequently rather questionable.  The competition modes, for example, can more or less go hang from my perspective.  The X Games mode re-creates the street and vert competitions from the real-life event, without pausing to think whether this would actually be fun in a videogame context.  In case you're wondering, it isn't, really.  The street course is small, without many long or complex lines, and the halfpipe is ridiculous.  This is an interesting event in reality because of the actual skill and exertion involved -- in a game, you just roll back and forth like a pendulum, and the only challenge is trying to use as many different tricks as you can, so as to avoid the repeated-trick penalty.  The arcade levels are of course a bit better, but Neversoft's designers obviously have a much better handle on what makes a great skateboarding level.  Creating clever little lines is not enough. Creating pleasantly symmetric bits of architecture is not enough. Creating one really cool line to a secret area is not enough. X Games has all of these, and they are not enough. A good level needs lots and lots of long, complex, intersecting lines, enough combo potential to hold a player's interest through hours of gameplay. X Games does not have this.   It doesn't help, however, that the control and rail detection demand too much from the player.  It's not quite as bad as MTV Sports Skateboarding, but the problems are analogous.  The trick commands aren't very responsive, and the rails have a very narrow area of detection.  You can't hop up to a rail from close by --instead, you have to get some running room, ollie, and very carefully land on top of it.  This is tricky for a couple of reasons. The jump controls have a slight delay to them, which makes judging your distance difficult, and the camera angle (which is very low) has the same effect.  If you do make it on a rail, grind-trick combos are difficult, because there's a nasty delay in the response for flip tricks as well.   As far as the selection of tricks is concerned, ESPN is a little ahead of the original Tony Hawk, markedly behind Tony Hawk 2, and let's not talk about Hawk 3.  They're divided into four categories instead of the usual three: flips are on the square button, ~air~ tricks (rockets, tuckknees) are mapped to circle, the top shoulders perform grabs (mute, indy, etc.), and grinds are on the triangle button as usual.  If you want to rotate a trick you have to use the lower shoulders, though, not the D-Pad.  Thus, you have to use an extra finger most of the time when performing on the vert ramp.  Manuals are available to link street tricks, along with one or two other basic flatland tricks, but they're not as responsive as Hawk 2's manuals and you have to use an extra button, the triangle.  The special trick selection is the one bit that doesn't necessarily lag behind, but even it has its problems.  Only a skater's ~super trick~ (performed with all of the three-stage special meter) actually gets a name.  The rest are only described as ~special grab~ or ~special air.~  Go to the trouble to do a Christ Air or whatever and while the animation is perfectly recognizable, it's just a ~special air.~  Go figure.  Sound  Before I address the general issue of X Games' sound quality, I would like to comment on a specific choice made in the process of licensing the game's soundtrack: to wit, the inclusion of Sum 41's new hit single ~Fat Lip.~  The comment:        PUNK ROCK    NOT PUNK ROCK    The above more or less sums up the problem with X Games' licensed music.  This is another sign-ten-random-punk-bands game, without much evident taste or discretion guiding the selections.  It's funny how often you come upon games whose directors don't even realize they're sharing songs with two other games -- X Games, for example, decided to throw in American Hi-Fi's ~Scar,~ forgetting that it was already in MTV Sports Pure Ride and, if my memory doesn't fail me, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX (unless I'm confusing it with that godawful Incubus song or some other lousy snowboarding game).  The announcer isn't so easy on the ears either, so SSX remains the only game that's managed to implement such a feature effectively.  Being told ~that's gotta hurt~ after my hundredth successive bail doesn't bring the point home any more than it already has been. It wouldn't be hard to craft a neat little analogy comparing the recycling of the lame announcer quips to the entire concept of making a knockoff skateboarding game, but I've run out of wit at this hour of the day.Long story short: there is no reason to own this game.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is coming in a couple of months to provide a vastly superior video skating experience, and meanwhile, X Games brings nothing new to the table that shouldn't have been kept in the kitchen.  The interface and presentation elements are nice to look at, but when that's the biggest thing your game has going for it, you are in real trouble.My sympathies, then, to Bob Burnquist, who doesn't seem to have moved on to greener pastures, and Chad Fernandez, whose supremely cool Afro Flameboy deck really deserves to be in a better game.
