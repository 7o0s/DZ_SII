{"name": "Casino Tycoon", "name_review": "Casino Tycoon", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/12/18/casino-tycoon", "text": "is yet another in the recent rash of tycoon releases, like Monopoly Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon.  This one comes to us from Monte Cristo Multimedia.  The name says it all, as players take on the roles of casino owners and try to build and budget their way to 5 star casinos.  I honestly hope that running an actual casino presents more of a challenge and stays interesting longer than it appears in Casino Tycoon.    As a new casino owner, players place various forms of gambling and entertainment throughout the casino floor in an attempt to be the biggest, richest and best casino around.  There are two modes of play, in addition to a tutorial.  The Sandbox mode allows a player to free play, building however they would like.  The Challenges Mode puts a competitive edge to the simulation.  Challenges range from raking in the most dough to attracting the most customers.  There is even a challenge to beat the other casino owners to the first 5 star casino.    In most situations, the player starts with an empty casino floor and some money.  There are certain structures that must be built to make any money.  A cashier booth is absolutely necessary.  Also, helpful items like an ATM machine, restrooms, a janitorial closet and a maintenance room can be placed.  There are several types of slot machines and video games, as well as gambling tables.  Before a single gambling table can be placed, though, a Pit Boss Area is required.  Advanced gambling tables and video machines require additional upgrades to the casino and some require gambling lessons.  Each object and structure can be somewhat personalized with a trim color.  Several options are available for floor and wall coverings, to re-design the casino's appearance.  There are wall hangings, couches, tables and plants for decorative purposes.  Two themes also lend variety to the game, an Asian theme and a Monte Carlo theme, adding extra styles for games and service booths.  Customers are the heart and blood of making profit in any casino.  Owners need their money, which means attracting them to the casino.  Slot machines will get them in the front door, but to keep them, restaurants, hotels, gambling tables and bathrooms are good ideas.  Emoticlouds, pictures that float above the guests heads periodically, will convey what they desire and their current thoughts can be viewed in the guest information screen.  There are two interesting types of interaction with the game.  The first involves security cameras, guards and thieves.  Once security cameras are placed around the casino, the player can look through the camera to try to detect thieves.  Once detected, these thieves will have a thief emoticloud above their head and their outfit will be replaced with prison stripes.  By clicking on the handcuffs, the thief is then escorted out of the casino.  The second notable interaction is with the first aid station.  Periodically, patrons may have heart attacks, and if the medic can get to the person before the devil, a symbol of death in Casino Tycoon, they will save that persons life.  However, if the devil reaches the customer first, that customer will go poof  and the overall number of customers the player has will decrease.  A distinct problem I had with the challenge mode is there is no real interaction or visibility of the other competitors.  There is a specific icon to click to see how the other computer players are doing, but it doesn't automatically pop up when a day or week ends.  Also, it is not possible to view the competitors' casinos.  They are merely statistics.  I would have liked to have seen how they were building up their casinos and wished they were more than abstract ideas with numbers attached.  Another trial of this game is that after a while, the game becomes incredibly easy.  This is great in a situation where the player merely wants to build up the largest and most attractive empire, but for anyone looking for a challenge, this game isn't it.  It was a bit disappointing that increasing the price of some of the games right away and placing as many as I could would bring in money faster than I could spend it.  To bring in more customers, a player only needs to purchase more of the land and plotting down items methodically seems to have little place in Casino Tycoon, unless the aspect a player likes most about a game is in aesthetics.   Graphics aren't all that impressive.  The customers are blocky and most of the games are not detailed.  Some of the animation can be interesting to watch, for a short time.  The cocktail waitress delivers drinks and returns to the bar, where her tray is refilled and she waves to patrons until someone wants a drink.  The dealers appear to be dealing cards and do so accurately, depending on how many gamblers are at the table.  However, in what appears to be a bug, patrons would keep crossing the floor in front of the entrance over and over instead of going into the casino to spend their money.  The camera angle is customizable and zooming in on a specific table or zooming out to include a large portion of the casino is available.  Music can get somewhat annoying, but the sound effects can be fun to listen to.  The slot machines cha-ching and the ATM Machines make bleeping noises.  Sound is nothing too special though.  Casino Tycoon might have been a great game if it had been released 2 years ago, but with the other tycoon games on the market, it falls miserably short of being any good.  Graphics are sub-par and the game is not at all challenging.  In the grand scheme of tycoon games, this one lacks where others don't.  This means Casino Tycoon is a pass, not a play.    -- Staci Krause      Want to share your opinions with the world?
