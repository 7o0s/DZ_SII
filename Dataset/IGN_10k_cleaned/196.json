No, I'm not talking about Phil Collins' next worldwide tour--I'm talking about the Demon. In today's world of ambiguous morals it's nice to find a villain you can hate without feeling guilty. The Demon doesn't blame his anti-social, psychopathic behavior on his parents or television. He's just evil 'cause he likes it. So go ahead lotus-eaters, hate away. It's okay.  So the story is this...Centuries ago, the four Clans lived in harmony. Then the Demon came. Things got really bad and the Clans turned on each other. A group of wizards gathered together to create the Crown of Peace. The Crown brought the Clans together and the Demon was defeated. End of story? Not a chance. Peace bred indolence and weakness. Now the Demon is back. He's stolen the Crown and it's up to you, the leading champion of your Clan, to retrieve it.  The game takes place in an ancient fortress in which the Demon resides. You start out at the gates of the fortress and must battle your way to the top where the big showdown with the Demon will take place. Along the way you'll pass through lava-filled caverns, the fortress dungeon, a garden courtyard and the king's quarters. All of the levels in the game are divided into many separate ~rooms,~ each of which is linked to one to four other rooms. Red arrows at the edges of the screen indicate paths to adjacent rooms.  The decision to divide the maps up this way detracts a lot from the game. Where in a game like Diablo you can move freely around the entire map, Clans' system of rooms as separate zones constantly reminds you that you are playing a game. It also means that you won't encounter any roaming monsters in Clans. They all stick to the rooms they are in. They will chase you from one room to another once they've found you, but you can use this to your advantage. As you retreat, taking care to only pass through cleared rooms, you can build up mana and set an ambush for them. In fact, this is the only practical way to defeat the Demon.  But it's not just moving freely from room to room. Clans has a lot of puzzles, especially on the higher levels. First off, and easiest to solve, are the locked doors. These merely require that you find a key. Then you get to the harder puzzles. You'll be required to manipulate levers, push barrels over pressure plates and use teleport pads to get around in the fortress. Most of these puzzles involve simple trial and error and, if you make a mistake, they can be reset.  There are four characters to choose from in Clans. Alaric represents the Warrior Clan. He has some ability with magic and is also good with a sword. Gard Stoneskin of the Barbarian Clan excels in all physical attributes but is short on magic. The Dwarven Clan have chosen Thorfinn as their hero. Not only is he a demon with an axe, he's also very strong. Leayandor represents the Elven Clan. He's got a lot of mana but has little chance of surviving physical combat. Now here's the secret...don't use any of these guys' default characteristics. You can do much better rolling your own stats. Here's another clue; the PickLocks skill is totally unimportant. I never found a chance to use it.  The items to be found in the fortress are pretty mundane. In terms of equipment, you will only ever find swords, axes, shields and armor. None of the items possess any special bonuses or abilities--they're just better versions of normal items. The five, count 'em, five, rings in the game are pretty basic too. One adds to agility, while the other four only add damage to your attacks. You will also need to find scrolls for the five spells in the game.  Let's just cover the magic system now. There are five spells in the game. Only one has any real potential for thoughtful use. The other four are just damage spells. The one neat spell, Confusion, freezes your enemy for a few seconds allowing you the opportunity to get a few cheap shots in or head for the safety of another room. There are five levels for each of the five spells but every scroll you find will bear a level one version of its spell. To get the higher level spells, you have to combine multiple scrolls of the same spell type. Have two Fireball scrolls? Use them together to form a level two Fireball. Scrolls are permanent items, so you can't use them up.  Rounding out the list of magic items are the potions. Although these are mediocre for the most part, you'll find yourself gulping potion after potion in order to keep your health up. That's my biggest problem with the game. Mana regenerates; health does not. You'll wind up finding all sorts of magic potions that you don't really need. Within a minute or so, your mana will build up to normal levels on its own. Health potions are far too scarce in this game. I could understand if there was a healing spell or something but no such luck.  The only other things to find in the game are big piles of gold. Normally you would use this to buy stuff, but mercantilism doesn't exactly thrive in the Demon's fortress. There are a few vendors scattered about, but they usually don't have too much to sell. There are a few other folks to meet in the game. Most of these guys will give you little quests to complete and reward you with a new weapon or spell. There's even a nice old lady who just gives the stuff out for free. Now that's cool. I've got enough to worry about what with saving the universe and all. Your missing gold can wait.  If these were the only people in the game, your job would be easy, but the fortress is populated by the Demon's ~entourage,~ which is French for entourage. This motley crue...ahem, crew, is composed of all sorts of nasty stuff--from the lowly, but frustratingly agile goblins to the vicious, hulking orcs. You'll also run across dark elves, skeleton warriors and evil mages. One of the truly cool things in this game is the fact that the enemy monsters will fight each other. In fact, every creature in this game will fight any other type of creature to the death. You can really take advantage of this. When you walk into a room and see two dark elves beating up a puny lillfet, jump in and start wailing on the elves. They'll kill the lillfet for you and be too weak to put up much of a fight after that.  Multiplay has some good points. First, the maps are generated randomly and you can set the size you want, from 25 rooms to 400. There are four types of maps, too--mud, lava, commoner's quarters and king's quarters. There are two game types here--deathmatch and gold rush. Deathmatch should be familiar enough. You can set the game to end either at a prearranged number of deaths or time limit. The objective in the Gold Rush game is to gather up all the piles of gold laying on the ground. There's also a cooperative mode, where you can fight the Demon as a team.  But there are some problems. To begin with, we couldn't get a LAN game going in our office. Despite repeated attempts by your truly, the damn thing just didn't work. Internet games are okay, but there's no search utility included with the game. You have to know the address your looking for or you're sunk. The thing that really kills the multiplay experience is the zoning system used for the rooms. You and your buddy could pass right by each other without even knowing it if you happen to be travelling between rooms at the same time.  Clans is a pleasant enough game, but it's just too plain. There's nothing here to excite or challenge even the most casual gamer. There's very little depth to the world. A fantasy game's appeal comes from lots of interesting and unique objects. Am I wrong? Throw us a gauntlet of strength or an invisibility necklace or some magic boots. I mean, there are only two types of weapons in the whole game! You can't help but feel cheated. I didn't really feel connected to my character either. Other than the various magic items in the game, there's no feeling of progression or growth in terms of character abilities.  One of two things has to happen now. Either a) game companies have to stop using the term RPG when all they really mean is ~fantasy~ or b) I have to change my own assumptions about what an RPG is. Since we all know I'm not changing my mind, I think the answer is pretty obvious. I have three games on my shelf right now that are all described as RPGs, but which bear only a superficial resemblance to the RPGs I remember playing in high school. To me RPGs are all about character development and interaction. That's the role in RPG after all. Clans (and numerous other games on my plate) claim to be RPGs, when all they really do is duplicate the context of the traditional fantasy RPG world. Don't be fooled.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Sep 1, 1999"}
