Also part of the fun is the three-point contest, and THQ Wireless is joining the celebration with NBA All-Star 3-Point Shootout.   The contest puts you on the perimeter of the three-point line. You move along the perimeter, stopping at five racks of five balls. The first four balls are regular orange basketballs, each worth one point. The fifth ball in each rack is the ~money ball,~ a red-white-blue ball worth two points. You have a limited amount of time to move through all five racks. The perfect score is 30.   This is an incredibly casual game, perhaps even too casual for its own good. You control the entire contest with a single-button. Grab the ball with ~OK~, hold down ~OK~ to jump into the air, release ~OK~ to shoot. That's it. All it comes down to is timing. Release at the apex of the jump and chances are good you'll sink the basket. Rinse. Repeat.   NBA All-Star 3-Point Shootout tries to add a little strategy with the sheer number of available players. Current superstars and NBA legends are intermixed in the roster. And everybody shoots appropriately differently. For example, Shaq shoots like crap. You have to be just right with the release or you will watch it clang off the rim. The Blazers' Damon Stoudamire is also a tough sell, as his small size means you have to hold ~OK~ a little longer for the guy to reach the top of his jump. But put Kobe or Larry Bird on the line and you'll find those threes sink like the Titanic.   The game has multiple play modes, such as just a regular one-person trial, or you can set your fave player up against a computer controlled challenger.   NBA All-Star 3-Point Shootout looks great, though. We tested the game on an LG VX7000 and the game looked bright and vivid. The player models are decently detailed and approximate their real-life counterparts at least in size. (You always see them from the back, so who knows about their mugs.) Uniforms are correct and colorful, complete with numbers. The arena is exceptionally well done with good detail and animation, such as the stars on the floor and the purposefully distracting electronic banners around the rim of the court. The basketball arcs look great and the clang when one goes foul always pleases. In addition to the looks, developer Lavastorm really nailed the audio. The game's digitized announcer sounds pretty good -- you can always understand what he says.  I can totally understand and appreciate what THQ Wireless is trying to do with NBA 3-Point Shootout. It's a casual game for NBA fans, offering a breezy challenge. But I think it's almost too breezy. Sure, you can pick players not exactly known for their three-point prowess to make it harder, but who will really do that? They'll just pick their favorite from the line-up and stick with that player.The fun can be drained in an easy half-hour of play, then you realize you're just sitting there, rhythmically hitting ~OK.~ I lost interest in this game fairly quickly, and I suspect that only the most die-hard wont do the same. However, I have to give Lavastorm credit for the visuals. It's a smart-looking game with great use of color and excellent audio.", "date": "Feb 22, 2005"}
