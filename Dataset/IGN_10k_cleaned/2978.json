The GameCube Rocket Power: Beach Bandits takes players to the shore to compete in a variety of skating, skiing, surfing and biking objectives, all encapsulated by the lucrative license and charmed by its goofy characters. The end experience is neither bad nor very good, but rather something caught up in a wave of mediocrity -- a fate that befalls so many quick-to-market licensed videogames.  The Facts  Play as one of four characters from Nickelodeon's Rocket Power series Uncover clues in a mystery involving the disappearance of sand from the beach Ride in a number of events: skateboarding, rollerblading, jetskiing, ziplining and more Solve puzzles and make your way through platform areas Requires 10 memory blocks to save No progressive scan or DPLII support   Gameplay Something's up at the beach: the sand has started to disappear on the shore, revealing jagged, dangerous rocks -- impossible to surf. As a result, the tourists have stopped coming to the area and the locals may not even be able to participate in a scheduled surf contest. It's up to the Rocket Power team, Otto, Reggie, Twister and Sam, to find out what's going on and restore order. And that is the premise for Beach Bandits, a 3D platformer-type filled with various extreme sports sequences.  This is a game targeted at the core audience of the television show, which is of course largely very young. Everybody else, turn back now. Naturally developer Evolution Games has catered it easy so that just about everyone can pick it up and easily play it. The main portion of the title is dedicated to exploration and puzzle solving -- the Rocket Power team must walk about the pier, search for clues, interact with other characters, and try to discover why a bunch of trashcan-like robots have been positioned all over the beach. It's not terribly engaging, but kids -- especially fans of the show -- will probably be hooked.  An arrow points gamers in the direction of the next clue and this method works well for the most part, though there are definitely times when it expects players to walk through walls to get there, or to go around an entire level -- a problem that's sure to confuse some young players. Also, various cut-scenes are triggered as the Rocket Power team approaches a specific goal and occasionally the arrow points gamers back to a clue they've already been to, thoroughly disorienting, which is flawed execution on the developer's part.   Control is straightforward with only a few buttons utilized; A jumps and B shoots hockey pucks and other various items at would-be enemies. The setup is basic, and intuitive, but there's nothing special about it. The camera system is controlled manually with the C-stick, an oversight as far as we're concerned given the target audience of the game. It's clunky at best, which also describes the slow pacing of the exploration and puzzle solving elements.  Left are the extreme sports offerings. These too are somewhat of a mixed bag. Skateboarding a halfpipe (one of the first challenges), for instance, serves up a forgiving stunt mechanic meaning that it's very hard to bail or to turn the board into the wrong direction resulting in a spill. And yet the controls are awfully unintuitive -- much harder to learn than in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, which makes no sense since this is supposed to be a kid's game. Whereas in THPS the forward motion is automatic, players must press and hold the B button in Beach Bandits, ollie with the A button and then figure out how to do tricks in the air with shoulder buttons -- a lot of juggling for a younger player. On the plus side, the extreme events are at least more than an afterthought. Once learned they are mildly entertaining, and some of the other sports are more intuitively placed so that they can be picked up easier.  In the end, Rocket Power junkies will probably still find the play experience in the game enjoyable. There are, to the title's credit, a number of entertaining events to compete in, the world itself is large and full of recognizable characters and the variation is commendable. But potential buyers should be warned that there is nothing extraordinary about Beach Bandits. It is, by most measures, a mediocre game and little more.  Graphics and Sound Beach Bandits does a decent job of recreating the Rocket Power universe. The characters from the series all look like their cartoon counterparts thanks to ordinary modeling and some spirited facial animations. All of the folks in town are equally well designed and complemented by fluid animation. Surprisingly, the textures in the game aren't terrible, which seems to be a problem in most licensed videogames. But on the other hand players won't be finding anything crisp and overly detailed in these environments either. The biggest gripe, easily, is the framerate, which constantly chugs and drops in spite of the entirely too low-polygon world and levels of the game. The camera system is also sub par.  The audio experience, meanwhile, isn't all too bad. On the bright side, the game does employ a good amount of voice acting from the cartoon series so that the all of the kids sound as they do on the Nickelodeon show. Also, much of the character interactions similarly feature voice acting, and it's all of fairly good quality. The music and sound effects, finally, get the job done without really standing out.  Rocket Power: Beach Bandits is a kid's game. On some levels, it's a decent one. The Rocket Power license has been utilized in full so that there is a mildly engaging storyline based on the series, lots of familiar characters who look and sound as they do in the show, and enough puzzles and extreme sports to satisfy die hard funs for a bit. But indeed because it's a kid's game some of the control setups and challenges are baffling as they are anything but intuitive and perhaps too hard for many young players. Also, the technology in place is dated, at best, and there's really no excuse for that, kid's game or not.Mediocre. Still recommended for young players who love the show, but parents considering the purchase should beware that they might have to help their little ones out every once in awhile when they get stuck.", "date": "Sep 26, 2002"}
