It's been a year and though there are still not many games coming in the first quarter of the year, there have been some new fighters released.  The pressure, then, is on DreamFactory's UFC: Tapout 2 to deliver something new from the previous iteration.  Unfortunately, while the fighting engine is still solid and the game remains fun, its total lack of significant improvements may kill any need to purchase the sequel.  Features All your favorite UFC fighters... whoever they may be! Blood splatter, grapples, arm locks, leg locks, and pained expressions abound Create a fighter and take them into any mode Improved graphic and fighting engine  Custom soundtrack support  Gameplay The Ultimate Fighting Championship is like wrestling, but real.  Men pop each other in the mouth, kick, slap, grab, choke, and grope one another in an octagonal ring.  There's blood, there's grunting, and there are lots of tapouts.  There are two ways to win in this quick-paced game.  First, you can knock your opponent out by pummeling them with short combos or mounting them and then putting a beat-down on their face.  The other is to force them to tap out (hence the name).  The combination of these two styles (as you will often use a mixture of tactics) creates an interesting fighting dynamic.  In one respect, you've got the get some hits in on your opponent to weaken or stun them.  On the other hand, you're trying for a quick tapout to seal your victory.  As with last year, UFC: Tapout 2 features a ton of real-life UFC competitors.  There are a variety of fighting styles and each fighter has specific strengths, making every fighter unique to fight with and against.  But DreamFactory nailed this last year and really didn't add anything new other then extra fighters.  Looking at the PS2 and Pride FC, Tapout 2 seems to have been left in the dust.  In Pride, for example, a fighter can fighton the ground from his back at an opponent still on his feet.  They can even scramble around the ring on the ground if need be.  But this kind of advancement hasn't come to the UFC and when you're on the ground you're essentially planted in one position unless you change your mount.  The improvements to the fighting engine are certainly there, but it's not terribly significant.  Hopping from the original Tapout to the sequel, the game balance remains the same.  Fights are still lightning-quick and rarely last a full round.  A lot of the moves also remain the same.  Frankly, it's not enough of a change to really be noticeable from a casual glance and isn't significant enough to improve or harm gameplay.    On a positive note, that means that Tapout 2 maintains the cool strategic elements of the first and that it's still a load of fun.  It's such a different experience from other Xbox fighters or wrestling games and that's refreshing.  But, then, it's just like one particular Xbox game and that's the first UFC: Tapout.  There just doesn't seem to be much passion for this game from DreamFactory.  If there was, there'd be some extra spark of life here.  While a few new modes have been added this year, they are your standard fighting fare.  In total you have: Arcade Mode - Fight through an infinite number of opponents to earn a high score Champion Road - Battle through your weight class for the UFC title Legend Mode - Defend your title against all challengers Tournament Mode - Compete in a classic 8-man tourney Exhibition - One on one battle Career Mode - Create a character and train them Training Mode - Practice your moves  Most of the modes are a variation on the same theme -- beat people in the ring.  Sometimes you're the challenger, sometimes you're defending the title.  In the end, it's really all the same thing with a slightly different structure.  And Career Mode isn't what you expect.  After an excellent character creation process, you'll have four tournaments to raise your character's stats.  Between each tournament, you can spar with a variety of partners to raise stats as well.  However, after the fourth tournament, the Career Mode ends.  Some career huh?  You can then use your leveled up fighter in any of the other modes.  This is actually a really cool in-depth character creation process.  How you perform through those training months will determine how good your created fighter will be.  They just shouldn't have called it Career Mode because, well, it's not really a career mode at all.  It's a character creation mode or a training mode.      One thing that failed to be added this year were additional arenas.  Yes, the UFC fights occur in ~The Octagon~, but every fight in Knockout Kings appears in a ring yet they manage to take them to different locales.  Wouldn't an Atlantic City crowd be different than a crowd in Japan?    This lack of extra rings coincides with a general lack of a change in interface.  The menus look the same, the intros and all of the set-up seems identical to last year.  What makes Tapout 2 different from the original?  A good question that lacks a definitive answer.  Though I'm bagging quite hard on Tapout 2, let me assure you that the gameplay is still solid and the game still quite enjoyable.  But a fighting game must boast significant improvements year to year.  We expect it from fighting and wrestling games and Tapout 2 fails to do anything interesting with an established franchise.  This game seems like it could have come out three months after the original.  It's just not inspired at all.  When I was a kid, my buddies and I used to argue over whether or not wrestling was fake.  It's hard to believe that such melodramatic showmanship could ever be considered ~real,~ but we loved it anyway and both into the mythology.  Now, all grown up, a very different sort of arena entertainment has become popular.  There's no doubting that the Ultimate Fighting Championship is real.  There's blood, broken bones, and men in tears.  However, the UFC lacks much of the pomp and showmanship that has made wrestling such a sensation.    I mention this because it seems unfair to criticize a game for being too true to its sport.  But, the lack of flare in the UFC and DreamFactory's determination to display that (or is it not display that in their game) may hurt the UFC: Tapout franchise in the long run.  I'm not suggesting that you see people bringing chairs into the ring or that there be big melodramas before each match, but they have got to offer more than just several variations of an arcade mode.  Put some story there.  Do something like Deathrow where you have to battle your way up the ranks and interesting things happen along the way.  All it takes is desire and creativity.  Do DreamFactory and TDK have this?  We'll have to wait for Tapout 3 to find out.  Graphics UFC: Tapout 2 has seen some graphical improvements over the original, including some smoother animations, better specular highlighting, and a more polished look.  However, there's just as much clipping as last year, so you'll see a fighter's leg merge into another fighter.  And the collision detection is a problem.  Some punches can land with a good half-foot of space between fist and face.  And the blood splatters are still merely round blotches.  Couldn't we get some improvement here? Maybe even blood on the fighters or real-time damage like in Tao Feng?  It's a good looking game, no doubt, with great crowds and some awesome muscle definition -- but it's the same game as last year.  Where's the inspiration?    Sound Sound has seen a few enhancements with more voice over work, but it's not terribly much.  Character's grunt and howl, but the crowd is pretty much just a blank slate of cheers.  Why not have some reactions to devastating moves?  How come some fighters aren't more loved than others?  There are some fighter-specific chants (just there names) but that occurs in the intros, not while fighting.  On the plus, you can rip your own soundtracks to the game so you can avoid the heavy-metal themes if they aren't your style. If you didn't buy the first Tapout, then the sequel is definitely a worthy pick-up.  The game's a lot of fun for both single and multiplayer.  However, if you've played the original, this one really isn't worth the $50.  While there are improvements and more fighters, it's just not enough to merit spending that much money.  If you see it later for $20 or maybe even $30, definitely grab it, but I was pretty disappointed in how little was changed.  This series needs an overhaul next year if it's to go anywhere besides down the drain.", "date": "Mar 18, 2003"}
