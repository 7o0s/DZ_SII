Games like Mario Tennis and Sega's Virtua Tennis have long won over fans beyond the hardcore tennis crowd. The appeal of these hits can be attributed to an intense sense of action and tight controls. Sadly, the first and only tennis offering for GameCube, WTA Tennis falls short in these areas, sporting deeply flawed controls, which results in a frustrating experience.   Features  One or two player tennis Single or double matches Play as your favorite WTA players Players sport the likenesses of their real-life counterparts   Gameplay Intense gameplay is the all-encompassing reason for prompting even non-tennis fans to buy a tennis game. It is a style of gameplay that reaches back to the days of Pong. Simple controls and play mechanics, instant gratification, reflex driven gameplay and adrenaline pumping rallies are what make videogame tennis such fun. It's too bad then that the GameCube's first tennis outing sports such unresponsive and frustrating controls that sabotage its chances of being an enjoyable game.   Players are given two control options, neither of which are of much help. One option is the so-called ~easy~ mode, where the A button automatically chooses the appropriate swing for various play situations. This certainly does make the game easier for the computer, as pressing A tends to set the computer up for an easy overhand smash. The ~expert~ control option is slightly preferable due to a slightly increased sense of ball control.  More irritating than how the ball behaves when you hit it, is trying to connect with the ball in the first place. Attempting to move your character around the court feels extremely slow and clumsy. It is impossible to change directions quickly enough to consistently connect with the ball. Once the player manages to get close to the ball, connecting with it is very unforgiving. While most tennis games allow the player to swing for the ball while running after it, WTA does not grant that luxury. WTA would have greatly benefited from allowing players to dive after distant balls instead of making them freeze in their tracks and swing five feet away from the ball. The game handles like molasses when quick reflexes are required to win.   Graphics WTA Tennis does a decent job when it comes to capturing the likenesses of its real-life players. Beyond that, the overall visual appeal in the game is mediocre. Player animation is stiff and unrealistic at times (running in place is common). Animations also interfere with the gameplay, as they are too time-consuming. For instance, changing the direction in which you are running causes the players to stop and slowly animate their turn. By the time you are running in the correct direction the ball has already passed you by. Textures are quite bland and solely used to differentiate court surfaces. The courts have a lifeless feeling, as the players are the only noticeable animations on screen. The crowd is extremely limited in its animations and is rarely even shown. The only ray of light in the dark are the detailed player faces. The rest of the presentation and graphics are average at best.   Sound WTA is not driven by musical melodies but by the grunts of the players and cheers of the crowd. The tension of a real tennis match has been successfully recreated with the muted murmurs of the crowd. The crowd cheers (although not completely realistically) with expressions of excitement, disappointment and astonishment. During a longer rally, the audience sounds may stutter a bit as the crowd's collective computer brain tries to keep up with the action. Players grunt similarly to their real-life counterparts, and the intensity of the grunt corresponds with the power of the hit. Some gamers will be turned off by the lack of music but tennis fans will recognize the ambient sounds of the court.WTA Tennis is a flawed execution of a potentially fun game. Frustrating and unresponsive controls result in a tedious gaming experience. Graphics and sound combine to form a mediocre package, and overall gameplay is too problematic to pass as fun. Fans of the tennis genre should check out Virtua Tennis or Mario Tennis for a great time and skip this one by.", "date": "May 21, 2003"}
