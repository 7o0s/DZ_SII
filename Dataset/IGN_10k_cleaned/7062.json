The game only revolves around the offerings of one car manufacturer, you upgrade your driver rather than the vehicles, you have the ability to rewind time and more. Unfortunately, while a number of these ideas may seem reasonable on paper, the implementation of them ranges from simply mediocre to outright bad.   The most fundamental problem with the game is that its driving model is seriously flawed. Control over your car is touchy at best - things feel fine at low speeds, but enter even the slightest curve at medium to high speeds and it'll feel like you're driving on ice. Applying the brakes means that you have practically no control over your vehicle (in many of the cars, anyway), meaning that you'll often have to completely slow down before entering a turn lest you want to send you car careening off the track at speeds that would be manageable in a minivan.    The AI doesn't help things much either. Though they don't follow a strict racing line, which is nice, they also don't seem to pay attention to other vehicles on the track, including each other. The first turn in nearly every race results in a small pileup and many of the AI drivers will lose their brake lights in the collision.   While singling out Alfa Romeo and running through 30+ of its cars may sound nice to fans of the maker, the result is that many of the rides drive very, very similarly. Moving from one car to the next in the list simply feels like you've added a few extra horsepower and equipped better tires on the previous car. You're also never allowed to pick the car you want to take on the track (aside from the Quick Race mode), and the CPU grid is always made up of the same cars as you so you never have to change racing strategies in order to beat mismatched opponents.   One thing that works semi-well is that rather than upgrading a garage full of cars, you'll assign points and earned gear to your driver. In theory this works pretty well, though there are a few issues. The gear selection screen is a pain to navigate as there are a ton of options for each type (gloves, shoes, helmets, etc.) and the game never gives you any sort of ~New!~ icon or such over the new items, meaning that unless you remember exactly what you've won, you'll have to navigate through each section to see if you have something a little better to equip.   For your driver's abilities, things seem very much unbalanced. For skills like Vision, Heart and Focus, each level of upgrade you make seems to have a noticeable and useful effect. On the other hand, upgrading your Handling or some other performance skills is so slight that it seems like a complete waste. The first time you do it you're only given an increase of 0.6%, for example. Who's going to notice a 0.6% increase in anything?    Perhaps the game's most curious and unique element is also one of its weakest. Each racer in the game has a ~driver condition~ that constantly fluctuates as you race. The idea here is that you're able to intimidate other drivers (or they you) by tailing closely behind them and getting under their skin. As a driver is intimidated, his condition will constantly drop until he's finally ~knocked out~ and his vision is blurred for a bit. On your end, this means that the screen gets rather blurry and it's hard to judge speed and some turns. It's actually not nearly as debilitating as it sounds, making it sort of pointless.   The stupid thing about this though is that when you're being tailed, you're not really able to do anything about it. Your only option, should you really want to avoid this, is to slow down and let the other car pass you, which is about the dumbest thing you can do when you're trying to win a race. Not that it really impairs your ability to drive much, if at all, but there's essentially no way to avoid it. Also, it's possible to catch the computer in a never-ending loop - when you knock them out, they'll only have a couple seconds of invulnerability where they'll gain back a few points, and then it's only another second before you knock them out again.Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano is certainly interesting, but it's too bad it's not any good. There are plenty of good and unique ideas here, but none of them work out as well as they could or should have. Some stuff though, like being able to intimidate other drivers by tailing them, were just bad ideas from the start. There are a billion other racing games on the market and most every one of them is better than Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano.", "date": "Jul 17, 2006"}
