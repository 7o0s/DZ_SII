In fact, it's such an odd game that the fact that it's actually coming out in the States is one of the biggest surprises of the entire year. And it's a very pleasant surprise, as the game is one of the most original and entertaining that's available on the system.   Gameplay There's not really a lot to this game as far as deep or innovative play mechanics are concerned, but that's part of the game's appeal. In trying to bring each of the game's ill-fated fated characters to their final destination, players will have to make it through 25 total mini-games that primarily revolve on the properly timing of button presses with some raw and unadulterated button mashing in between.   The levels range from being fairly quick, easy and somewhat uneventful to very challenging, enjoyable and awfully imaginative. Taneo's scenario starts off with a nice round of Bust-A-Groove/Parappa style gameplay where the player must press the appropriate button or directional pad direction at the correct time as the characters show off their dancing moves on screen. It's not the least bit challenging, but it's a pleasurable experience because the dance moves performed by the onscreen characters are pretty hilarious. Taneo doing the robot is worth the price of admission alone.   From there, it moves on to a variety of other off-the-wall mini-games that help tell the story of Taneo's and the rest of his family's disastrous day that will see them all cheat death many times if you prove to be successful. Some of the more enjoyable levels include a very pornographic-sounding Ferris wheel ride with a voluptuous vixen where you must try and massage her into a frenzy by following her cues to find the right spot and rub her all the right ways.  There are also many other cool little quests that range from having you try and keep a boat from sinking while objects are flying at you to escaping from a bank robbery without being shot and killed.   And while all of the different levels revolve mainly around simple twitching tasks and there's not really any sort of depth to the gameplay, the desire to play through the game is just intense because you'll find yourself wanting to find out what's next. The game is just presented so extremely well and is a complete blast to play through. Trust me when I say that you won't find many other games on PlayStation that will make you laugh or smile as much as you will when playing Incredible Crisis.   Graphics As much as I like the game, there's just not a lot that can said in a positive sense about its visuals. The 3D character models are comprised of a minimal amount of polygons, the textures are a bit bland and the game has a very rough and gritty look to it. And while they definitely are amusing, the full-motion video is ultra-graining and are plagued with lots of artifact compressions and just don't look as good as it could on the system. The only saving grace is that the oddball character designs in the game are somewhat endearing.   Sound Incredible Crisis is filled with lots of quirky sound effects and the main characters in the game don't really speak, but instead just have this bizarre scream. Just as bizarre is the game's music, which is comprised mostly of these really peculiar tunes that are very upbeat and quite entertaining. Just like the game on the whole, the audio is just so strange and off the wall that you just help be enjoying it.  It's really hard to explain the appeal of Incredible Crisis because it's not really like any other game that I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Sure, the game's play mechanics are based on the simple timing of button presses, but its concept, design and appeal are of the likes that have never been seen before. When playing it, I'm constantly telling myself that I really shouldn't be enjoying this game, yet I keep on playing and just can't stop smiling. The sad reality is that I really love this game and am completely thrilled that Titus has seen fit to bring it out in the United States. If they didn't do it, there's nobody else on the planet that would've touched it. So, once again, thank you, Titus. It might not completely make up for Superman and Carmageddon on N64, but it is definitely a step in the right direction.", "date": "Nov 28, 2000"}
