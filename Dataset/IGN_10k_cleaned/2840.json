Usually the split isn't so bad that I can't reconcile my feelings, with a little bit of effort, and present a reconciled point of view that presents both sides of the issue.  However, that is not the case with Gungrave, the new 3D shooter developed by Red Entertainment for Sega.  This is a game that inspires a genuinely schizoid response, one which must be given vent.  Thus, I introduce you to my two alters:  : Good Doktor, and : Evil Doktor  : My God, I hate this stupid game.  : Ignore him -- Gungrave is one of the most beautiful 3D shooters on PlayStation 2.  It's got a distinctive style, great character designs, top-notch special effects, cool soundtrack...  : You forgot to mention the slowdown, the repetitive animation, and the brain-dead AI.  Might want to let the kids know that you can finish it in about 45 minutes, too.  : Oh, screw you.  Gameplay  : Remember Loaded on the PlayStation?  : Yeah, I remember how much it sucked.  : Piss off, it's my turn.  As I was saying, Gungrave is that same kind of pure shooter, translated into 3D and given an extra shot of adrenaline.  It looks like a more complex third-person action game, but the feel is much closer to a more traditional 2D shooter -- there's not so much emphasis on wandering around and solving puzzles as has crept into action games of late.  Instead, the goal is to shoot things.  Shoot everything.  Shoot it very, very rapidly, until there is nothing at all left.  : In other words, the creators of this game assume that the market has not advanced substantially since the release of Berserk.  : This judgment, of course, completely ignores Gungrave's combination system, and the way it challenges you to perfect your shooting ability.  Every shot that hits a viable target, whether it's an enemy or a bit of the environment, counts up on the ~Beat~ meter in the upper-right corner of the screen.  So long as you keep continuously shooting stuff, that meter keeps counting -- but if you get hurt, slow down, or run out of targets, it resets back to zero.  Thus, it creates a combination of challenges: learning how the levels are laid out, keeping an eye on all the enemies around you, and staying quick on the trigger finger.  You also have to weigh your defenses in the balance.  The shielding meter that keeps your life from getting knocked off recharges faster if you stop shooting, but that will naturally stop your combo.  : Your combo also stops if you get stuck in a corner when the camera starts going haywire.  A lot of these areas are way too narrow -- walk into a corner and all of a sudden you can't tell which end is up.  That wouldn't be a problem if the game gave you full control over the camera (the right analog stick is just sitting there doing nothing), but unfortunately, there's nothing but a quick-turnaround button, one whose effects can be rather unpredictable when the camera doesn't directly follow your point of view.  : Read the above as ~I didn't learn how to control the game properly, so I'm going to blame its designers for the fact that I suck.~  Gungrave actually controls just fine once you learn how to use the diving roll maneuvers and keep an eye on your back at all times.  The game also rewards capable players.  The better a combo you rack up, the more chances you get to refill your life mid-level or use the ~Demolition Shot~ smart-bomb attacks.  And picking up a better grade at the end of each level (determined by your combos, time, total life, and other factors) means you earn more powerful Demolition Shots quickly.  And getting good grades throughout the game, especially on the higher levels of difficulty, means you unlock more fun extras: movie archives, sound tests, some really cool 3D model galleries, and lots, more.  : But you can finish this game in no time flat -- where's the replay value in something that takes so little time and demands so little skill?  Even on the Hard difficulty level, I can still beat it pretty quickly, just an hour or so.  : Yeah, and you probably have to continue 15 times, and use the life-restore thing 15 more.  Your problem is, your reflexes died back when you were still playing Super Nintendo games.  The point of a shooter like this is to perfect your skills, to improve your score, to get genuinely good at the game.  You can probably beat Gunstar Heroes in less time than it takes to complete Gungrave, and I'll bet you'd praise that game to the skies if the subject ever came up.  How long does it take you to beat Contra?  And don't you dare lie to me about the time you turned up the default lives in Radiant Silvergun.  Sheesh.  Every time you preview a shooter, you whine, whine, whine about how nobody makes a good shooter anymore.  Night and day you whine about the shooters.  Now Red comes along and makes a top-notch blaster like this, and what do you do?  Keep on whining.  Kids today...  : See, your problem is that you're trying to judge a modern game by the standards of the past.  Why the hell are you comparing this to Gunstar Heroes?  That game's eight years and two console generations old now.  We should be demanding more from games these days, no matter what the genre.  More depth of narrative, more complexity in gameplay, more replay value.  And by ~replay value,~ I don't mean this ~do the same damn thing over and over in order to unlock new widgets~ crap.  : Then what's with this nonsense in the Ikaruga preview?  Here, I'll read it back to you...  : Get bent -- hell, you probably wrote that.    Graphics  : Gungrave makes a nice screenshot, but once it gets moving too fast, the seams start to show.  The engine collapses under the weight of the action in several instances, and when the framerate drops, the aliasing comes out in force.  : Three years the PS2's been around, and you're still bitching about aliasing.  Get the hell over it.  If you're not some shut-in wanker obsessed with little technical details, Gungrave is gorgeous, cranking out plenty of polygons and effects to bring some excellent designs to life.  The look of the game comes mainly from the character designer, Yasuhiro Nightow (known mostly for the manga Trigun), but with a much darker, Gothic feel to it...  : Knocking off The Crow is so five years ago.  : Oh, come on.  I challenge you to deny to me that this game looks unbelievably cool.  The gunfights are amazing -- when Grave stands down against a huge group of enemies and just starts blowing the hell out of everything, you can't deny the rush.  The environments are thoroughly destructable, and the combo system even manages to integrate that into gameplay.  The boss designs are worthy of a Treasure game, and the cutscenes are gorgeous, too, with a great blend of 2D and 3D.  : Read the above as ~gratuitous abuse of the stock cel-shading effect in Lightwave.~  And what's with the animation?  : What do you mean?  It's got great animation.  The Max Payne diving roll maneuvers look cool, and you have to love the rapid-fire pose when you stand your ground and start shooting like crazy.  : But why is there only one animation sequence for that?  It looks completely ridiculous -- Grave does that same silly dance over and over every time you stop moving for more than two seconds, and half the time that gets you killed because you want to keep moving.  That bulldozer fight on the bridge, where you have to keep backing up?  Every time that silly animation starts playing, I die, lose my combo, or both.  They could at least have had the decency to animate a couple more poses.  : You just can't appreciate great art, can you?  : I can when it's not the same damn thing over and over.  Sound  : Tsuneo Imahori rocks you like a hurricane.  : Hey, that's my line.  : Well, the law of averages dictates that we have to eventually agree on something.  Nightow brought the composer of the Trigun soundtrack along with him (you may also recognize the name from his role as the guitarist for Seat Belts, the combo that performed most of Cowboy Bebop's music), and Imahori in turn brought plenty of his big-beat fusion style to track the game.  There are lots of heavy ska-sounding horns for the high notes, quieter bass grooves for the low ones, and the overall effect is a lovely alternative to what you'd expect to hear in a game like this (lots of awful metal, say).  : Of course, you can't often hear the music for the steady chung-chung-chung of gunfire.  Some sound designers seem to underestimate the importance of good gunshot effects (see the recent Hidden Invasion for a particularly unfortunate example), but these are gunshots with some real body to them.  There's also a lot of variation to the ricochet effects, depending on the surface being perforated.: There's just not enough here to justify a purchase.  I say again: you can finish this game in no time flat, the levels are almost completely linear, and there's no reason to play it again unless you really, really enjoy unlocking useless little widgets.: And there's no reason to believe him unless you're too old, too weak, and too fumble-fingered to appreciate a well-designed and beautifully-drawn shooter.  Gungrave is a perfect blend of the old and the new -- it has cutting-edge graphics and a great modern design sense, but it has the cool old-school feel of a classic shooter.: Nostalgia kills brain cells, son.  Dig up your old copy of Contra and see how much fun you have playing it now -- this stuff doesn't wash in the 21st century.: Piss off.  You probably couldn't beat the first level of Contra without the 30-lives code.: How about you come over here and say that?  I knew I never should have let you get Gogg to help out with the Z.O.E review!: Whyncha come over here and bring it, chump?  The best part of you dried up on a Saturn 3D pad!...This sort of thing went on for a little while.  Once it was over with, Good Doktor stuck to his guns and demanded a 0.0 score for Gungrave, while Evil Doktor dove for his throat screaming ~Perfect 10!  Perfect 10!~  As a consequence, I have chosen the middle road.", "date": "Aug 8, 2002"}
