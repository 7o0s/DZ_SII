Now whenever a space based strategy title comes out, I have the hope of seeing some of the majesty and loneliness of space revisited in a new forum. Such was the case with Nexus: The Jupiter Incident, a game that has undergone a quite a few changes from it's original incarnation as Imperium Galactica III. What we have here is a space opera that deserves some recognition. It takes a largely tactical slant over resource based games and does well for it. While it has a fair share of problems, it's a title that delivers on some deep tactical gameplay... as long as you can fight your way up that steep learning curve.   Nexus: The Jupiter Incident begins with a story of the first man born in space and his mysterious disappearance through a wormhole with a colonization vessel named Noah's Ark. After the collapse of that path, Earth considered that group lost. That man's son, one Marcus Cromwell, became a decorated war hero as Earth began fighting a new kind of battle. Corporations fought corporations over technology and money. It's a story that's been told before, but only where the game begins. Before too long, Cromwell is stuck in the middle of a galactic war and struggle for survival. The plot isn't anything that will be particularly shocking or new, but it has enough interesting additions to the regular formula to keep things fun.   The galaxy, characters, and plot all unfold over missions, briefings, and personal logs of Marcus Cromwell. The story is presented well with good cutscenes and some slickly realized maps of the galaxy. The only downsides (ones that aren't too hard to get over) are some of the voices and characters in the briefings. One Admiral in particular is a huge pain in the ass. He's made to come off as threatened by your pedigree and such, but comes off as a plain ass that's neither interesting nor fun.Voice work for most of the characters is decent, but when you finally hear the friendly alien race, tell me if they don't remind you of the friendly alien race from the movie Galaxy Quest. Not particularly awe inspiring.   Something that is awe inspiring is the way developer Mithis has gotten so good at capturing the depth of space. I still believe that Homeworld 2's art style was more refined and... well, artistic, but these are some damn impressive ships and locations. Mix in the real-time lighting and you have some particularly awesome space battles, especially when sound effects and radio chatter are added. This is a great looking and good sounding game.     I have to preface any discussion about the gameplay found in Nexus with a simple admission and then progress from there. Nexus was a hard game for me to grasp. This doesn't often happen with a real-time strategy title. In fact, I can't remember the last time I failed so many missions in a strategy game of any kind. The thing is, after playing this game for a lot of hours and progressing past the point of the steep learning curve, I've come to the conclusion that this wasn't entirely my fault. Much of the gameplay, especially the tougher missions, revolve around trial and error, which is especially vexing in this situation, is that most of the trial has to take place when loading out your fleet. So in essence, one of the deepest and most satisfying of the gameplay elements is bent by an oversight in mission planning and interface.    To really understand, you have to see how mission works at a basic level. Before each mission, the game plays a briefing (which takes place in a nifty galactic model) that gives a basic outline of what can be expected to happen. After the quick briefing, ships can be set up with weapons and devices based on a number of points given to each ship (of which there are only a few). The problem is, some of the situations encountered in mission are near impossible to beat unless you have the right setup for your ship, especially early in the game when ships are weak and the choices made bear more weight.   For instance, one of the early missions requires you to fight off a group of enemies that pop out of space. The problem is, you have no idea this is going to happen, nor do you know they'll have shields that can only be taken down by a certain weapon as you hadn't encountered them before. After the 13th try when you finally figure out what the hell you were supposed to be doing and what fleet setup works best, it tends to become more frustrating than fun.   Had there been some sort of hint structure in the mission briefings -- say one of the characters tells you to see if the new shield breaking weapons fit on your ship -- it would have been fine. Nothing huge is really needed, just simple additions to point players in the right direction instead of dropping us into a foreign game in a foreign situation and expecting us to figure it out right away. Or better yet, have multiple solutions to missions based on fleet load out. Either way, most of the missions don't have this problem, but those that do can be a frustration bunch.   But as I said, missions in general are actually pretty decent in design since they do charge players to complete different tasks in a variety of ways. The load out of your ship is pretty vital to success, but most of the time, you'll also know that having weapons that can take down shields and then crush a hull are probably going to be preferred. Sometimes having lasers that can target specific devices (such as engines or weapons systems) are going to be necessary, while other times you'll have to protect yourself with advanced fighters and send out bombers that can target and destroy the engines of fleeing ships.     The fact that you can either set up your ships with AI routines and stances or target each weapon on the ship individually is a big help. Most of the time, the AI will cover everything you'd like to do and fire in all helpful directions given the routine assigned. Giving a ship orders to engage one target aggressively doesn't preclude it from firing on other targets along the way. At the same time, if the ship's weapons energy has been pumped up to 200%, it'll fire all guns constantly, meaning while it's trying to crush the hull of one ship without shields it'll start firing shield breakers on another. The problem is, this doesn't always work. It's hard to tell what exactly keeps the AI from completing this behavior all the time, but you'll definitely find yourself pausing and giving weapons individual targets from time to time. It can be pretty fun to get into the nuts and bolts like this, but it can be pretty time consuming if you have to do it very often.    The ability to use all of the weapons in such specific ways leads to an amazing depth of tactics that aren't usually seen in space based RTSs. Homeworld 2 played at it, but didn't get to this level of detail. A couple of things thing that Homeworld 2 (certainly a different kind of strategy experience) definitely has over Nexus are fleet size and controls. Obviously, controlling a hundred ships with such tactical precision could have been a nightmare so the fleet size is an obvious gameplay consideration that was right in this case, but took from the kind of scope we're used to with a game of this type. And while the interface is pretty slick and allows targeting by both in-game models and list icons, there were some elements that were lacking for organization and group behavior. Grouping units created serious movement problems for bigger ships and didn't provide for special maneuvers. Movement in general was handled strangely for open space navigation (I really, really wish they had taken notes from Homeworld in this aspect). Lastly, fighters don't fly as groups or formations even though they're created as groups. I liked that fighters were simply given missions to carry out without having to always worry about their status, but they should have been able to be set in different formations for more precise targeting of devices vs. enemy fighters.   Each of the ships also has the advantage of having a character and crew associated with it. Having an association with that particular ship is great, but unfortunately, there isn't enough you can do with it. From time to time, a skill upgrade will be made available for the main character... but very few and far between and never for any other ships, which makes a guy wonder why even bother if you aren't going to go the whole nine yards? As it is, one of my ships being led by what amounts to a science officer still has a rookie crew and a captain with no military skill, which is strange considering that ship has functioned well and helped destroy a number of enemies.   But my biggest complain of all are the crashes. I've crashed to the desktop a number of times in the middle of a mission. A couple of times I was forced to completely restart a mission in order to get the entire way through. Breaking one ship's shields down all the way would cause the crash and there was no way around it. Most of the other crashes were more mysterious and I wasn't able to find any specific point of error. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to be completely immersed in a beautiful space battle (and therefore forgetting to save) only to have the desktop appear where just a moment ago I was about to crush Mechanoid controlled ships.    Nexus: The Jupiter Incident is a good game. I certainly didn't think so when I began playing it however. There's a frustratingly high learning curve here and the game design doesn't exactly help that at all. Hints for ship load out or tactics, different solutions for missions, and some better free movement controls would have alleviated some of that. But overall, this is a game that fans of space strategy games should be able to find a lot of depth in. There are a lot of different weapons with different abilities and the chance to set up an entire fleet with specialized purposes is pretty darn fun. This isn't going to be for everyone, but the story is decent and battles can be spectacular thanks to some brilliant graphics and exciting sound work.", "date": "Mar 22, 2005"}
