SSX  Trick for the handheld put to use the development team's proprietary 3D graphics engine for the environments and snowboarder, but as impressive as the technology was, the result was a very bland representation of the gameplay style that the console design established. For the GBA sequel, SSX 3, EA went back to the same team to create a game that felt more like the ~extreme~  franchise on the handheld. But this year's version is yet another reminder that the GBA just isn't powerful enough to accurately portray the console gaming experience; the game tries to be far more than the system is capable, becoming a sluggish, unresponsive mess of a snowboard game as a result. Features Link cable support for two players Cartridge save (one slot) Connectivity with the GameCube version SSX 3 on the console is a white hot design this year, showing up in many reviewer's Top Ten lists this year because of its excellent control and over-the-top fast-paced gameplay. The Game Boy Advance version is an extension of that game design for portable gamers, and it even links up to the GameCube version so that owners of both games can transfer money earned from one to the other. The game design for SSX 3 is, as the series has always been, downhill racing crossbred with a score-based trick system, so it's important not only to get the best time after a particularly lengthy run down the mountain, but also to perform aerial and grind tricks to increase earned points...and linking the tricks one after the other increases the value of the points. More tricks also means an increase in adrenaline, which can be converted into a faster boost of speed down the slopes.  We'll give Visual Impact credit for addressing our gripes from last year's SSX Tricky; SSX 3 is a much more expansive snowboarding title this year. There are more track layouts, more characters, a bigger trick system, and more energetic presentation overall. Yes, SSX 3 features deeper gameplay than last year's game. But in all the additions put into this sequel, the game bogs down the engine that drives it, and ultimately makes things worse in the process. 3D just isn't the Game Boy Advance's forte, and this game is just another testament to that fact. As much programming prowess that's going on behind the scenes in SSX 3, it's just continuously annoying and frustrating to watch the game move on the GBA screen.   The choice to continue to go fully 3D is the game's undoing, unfortunately; the development team is really set on showing the world that the GBA can indeed pull off a successful texture-mapped PSOne-style 3D engine, providing varied 3D environments and modeled characters that can pull off an array of airborne tricks. But the framerate chugs seriously in more congested places, mostly in Superpipe level designs where the player goes vertical and looks down at more area than the engine was obviously meant to draw. Textures flicker on and off, and the game's speed bogs down so much that the control had to be tuned to take into account the lag between button-presses and the on-screen action.  The developers have definitely tweaked the game to ~work~ in a sluggish environment; because the game's pace chugs, the trick engine has been given a lot of slack...flips and other can be landed at almost any angle. As long as you're not entirely inverted when you hit the snow, you'll pretty much stay upright and continue skiing. As a result, there's little to no rush in pulling off an airborne combo chain simply because the game has so much leeway in letting you complete them. And I still haven't figured out why the camera actually tips down towards the ground when pulling off an extended grind...it's almost impossible to see the end of the rail when the camera cuts off the view.  The visuals and sloppy controls aren't the only downsides; the game utilizes a variety of licensed music to accompany the downhill action, but the cartridge medium doesn't really allow for the developer to dedicate a whole lot of space to the soundtrack. So, the audio engineers loop samples together to extend the sampled pieces as players work their way down the mountain. This wouldn't be so bad in small doses, but some races can take more than five minutes to finish, and when a tune uses the same 15 second sample over and over and over and....well, you get the picture. You can certainly turn the music off (and it's highly recommended if you're not looking to get driven up a wall), but the user doesn't have the option to simply switch the song mid-race so it doesn't sound like someone's CD player's skipping.  Sometimes ~more~ isn't necessarily a good thing. SSX 3, while featuring significantly more gameplay elements than last year's SSX Tricky, ends up a much more disappointing GBA title because of the technical limitations. The engine used for the graphics has a hell of a time keeping up with all that the designers throw at it, and the detached, sluggish control just adds to the frustration. There's a reason why so many GBA developers stay out of the 3D arena, and experiencing SSX 3 is a good example of why this is so. If you can manage to put on blinders and see past all the visual and control issues, then yes, SSX 3 is technically playable. But I wouldn't call it ~fun.~", "date": "Nov 25, 2003"}
