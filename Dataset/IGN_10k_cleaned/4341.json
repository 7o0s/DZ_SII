This city simulator, designed by Will Wright, became an instant favorite not only on the PC where it originated, but Nintendo even produced a conversion as a launch title for the Super NES system. Popular games spawn sequels, and SimCity 2000 was a significant and successful release on the PC with its enhanced graphics and deeper management levels. That was more than a decade ago, and over time the game design trickled its way to the console market onto the current generation systems. The Game Boy Advance is the latest to get a conversion, but in the move many managerial and graphical elements had to be left on the cutting room floor in order to make the design work on the handheld. It's still a fun and challenging economics sim, but it's far from a direct port of the original design and feels more than just a little forced onto the tiny system and screen.Though your role in SimCity 2000 is ~mayor~ of a city, you're more godlike in power since the task is to build a civilization from pretty much nothing but a flat piece of land. By designating zones (residential, commercial, and industrial), and supplying power to these zones you make your city flourish with citizens, and the better you lay out your town and manage the incoming and outgoing resources, the more visual your city starts to become. Tiny houses become apartments, small businesses become skyscrapers, roads become highways. It's your job to ensure a steady growth by making the city work. If crime becomes a problem, plop a police station in a strategic location to remove that from the area. The skill comes from being able to spot problem areas and resolve them quickly and efficiently.Full Fat is the development team behind the game, a studio that's no stranger to the Game Boy Advance market with games such as Freekstyle and the Dave Mirra series under its belt. The team produced a game that looks and plays similarly to the original PC design, working with the GBA's system limitations to get the game to run on the handheld system. Even with that said and known, the port isn't entirely a smooth conversion.When the game was first conceived on the PC, the game pushed the hardware well beyond what the processor could comfortably handle, and that feeling has been unintentionally converted over to the Game Boy Advance. The dynamic design is most likely to blame; since the game's constantly on the move, calculating all sorts of elements and changing the on-screen graphics and tile-sets to visualize these changes, the gameplay is, for lack of a better word, chuggy. Even when there's not much action going on, trying to move the cursor around the isometric area is a choppy, sluggish mess. The developers make things just a little more intuitive by allowing players to toggle to the menu and back with a shoulder button, which definitely cleans things up, if just a little bit. But this tweak in interface can't hide the fact that the sluggish processing and screen update means that it's just not possible to play a quick and clean round of SimCity 2000.And it's not exactly a perfect port, either. It's not clear whether it was a technical problem or a design decision to make the game less cluttered, but a few elements were removed from the original's gameplay. Players can't create subways or manage underground sewer systems, for example. And the land masses have been completely flattened so players can no longer work on rising hills or falling basins. It's a few less elements to worry about while managing the city, sure, but it does affect a buying decision if fans of the original SimCity 2000 are looking for a direct portable conversion of one of their favorite games.Despite the technical limitations and the somewhat abridged Game Boy Advance rendition, the game still retains the challenge and fun in a smaller package. But with all the changes to the 2000 design as well and the overall slow gameplay, it might have been best if the developers simply went with the original and cleaner SimCity design for conversion to the handheld. But on the whole, it's a solid effort with a ton of playability...if you can manage through the overall sluggishness of the experience.", "date": "Dec 16, 2003"}
