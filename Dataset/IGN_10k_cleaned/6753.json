That about sums up River King: A Wonderful Journey, the latest game from Natsume. Obviously, the above statement will effectively nix a huge portion of today's gamers. After all, the Harvest Moon series has always been a niche franchise, opting for languid pacing and player patience over action and spiffy special effects.   But for those still interested, just know several aspects of River King keep it from ~must-own~ status, even for diehard fans of Harvest Moon or fishing fans. It would have been fine if developers slashed the farming aspects of Harvest Moon and replaced it with equally engrossing fishing, but that's just not the case here. Catching fish in River King feels less like a real fishing game and more like a mini-game, which simply doesn't make sense in a title focused on the most traditional of aquatic traditions.    True, it's not really aimed at hardcore fisherman, but it should still feel like your trying to catch a trout, bass or what have you. At the very, very least, it should be fun. Unrealistic and simple? Fine. But please make it somewhat involved and enjoyable. So, in the place of a compelling RPG with a decidedly fishy slant, you're stuck with a mediocre game that fails as a fishing sim and an RPG. It's sad, considering there's obviously a market (however small) for these types of games.  For those who need a little more information, here's how the game starts: you first select one of four characters (Father, Mother, Bro and Sis) before anything else. Each character has different attributes, including health points, fishing technique and cooking technique. It's a nice touch, actually, and it offers the game a little bit of added depth. After selecting your character, you then leave your house to explore the village. Now, instead of someone telling you where everything is, or having a map to look at, you're pretty much left on your own.   Not the biggest problem, since the village isn't that big, but you'll invariably get lost and lose time out of your (real life) day. Once you've explored the village a bit, you'll discover various fishing and cooking tournaments to join, characters to interact with and, of course, watering holes. You'll also discover the item and bait shop, and a seafood store where you can sell your catch. In short, River King has all the elements of a successful fishing RPG, but none of the above elements is presented very well, and none are all that interesting.   What should be the coolest thing in the game, fishing, simply doesn't play very well -- even though at first, it doesn't seem that way. You can buy different types of bait, including worms, maggots and insects, and different types of rods and lures, so there's plenty of customization. Add in the fact there's a variety of water holes and rivers, not to mention over 100 types of fish to catch, and things initially look bright. Unfortunately, the actual >act of fishing is invariably bleak.       You simply cast your line into a river by first taking out your rod (shoulder button) then performing the cast (X button). The longer you hold down ~X~, the longer the cast. Once a fish has nibbled on the bait, the camera switches to an underwater view. First and foremost, this whole segment of River King looks terribly bad.   And by terrible, you should understand pre-PS1, N64 quality visuals. Your eyes will burn from blurry textures and horrid animation - animation so bad, it's downright comic. Instead of actually yanking fish from the river, fish magically levitate straight out. They're still facing horizontally, mind you, yet their entire bodies get whisked away by unseen forces.   It's no fun ~catching~ them, either. It's a simple matter of holding down the ~X~ button to reel them in. There's no stress meter for your line, or anything. Sometimes fish will try and swim away, in which case you release the ~X~ button. Once they stop swimming away, which they also do, just hold the ~X~ button again to finish the job. It's simple, and worst of all, very boring. Sadly, it doesn't get much better in the course of the game. Fish will get a little more persistent, and you'll need to spend more money on the appropriate bait and equipment, but that's about it.    The rest of the game feels equally uninvolved, but at least you'll find several things to try. You can enter fishing tournaments, which aren't terribly exciting but help liven things up a bit. Then there's the cooking, which requires you to catch the appropriate fish, and then purchase the actual recipe from a store. Again, not very involved, but it's nice to take a break to cook up a storm and enter some of the cooking contests. And yes, there are several villages that eventually open up, and each is pretty decent, but none offers something truly unique.   In the end, River King: A Wonderful Journey lacks the appeal of a Harvest Moon game and a fishing game. The act of catching fish isn't much fun, and neither are the RPG aspects. Still, those absolute diehard fans of Harvest Moon may find something to like here, such as the overly cute aesthetic and languid pacing.", "date": "Mar 22, 2006"}
