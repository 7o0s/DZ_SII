Case in point: Balloon Fight. On the surface, it's a clever action game where players take to the skies and compete against other balloony pilots by attempting to pop competitors' helium-filled orbs.  In Japan, this may have been game design gold, and it inspired an import-only revival on the Game Boy Color back nearly a half decade ago.  In the US, we had already been playing Balloon Fight in the arcades, and on the Atari systems as Joust, and it's clear that Williams' own 1982 arcade game inspired Balloon Fight's existence. Replace the buzzards and ostriches with balloon-powered humans and you've essentially got Nintendo's own ~rip-off.~  Now, let it also be said that Balloon Fight is a far more versatile game design than Joust. Balloon Fight featured tons more levels of varying layouts of ~floating~ platforms to land on. It also had a unique ~Balloon Trip~ mode to put arm-flapping skills to the test by maneuvering through hazardous mazes of balloon-popping spikes.   But even though it improved on Joust, its concept and many of the design implementations were indeed blatantly swiped. Instead of collecting eggs dropped by the downed enemies (which, in turn, hatch into more powerful opponents), players have to knock downed pilots before they can inflate newer, more maneuverable balloons to take to the skies. Instead of a demon hand that can pull balloon pilots into the river if they float too close, Nintendo instead offers a giant fish that'll gulp 'em up. And instead of a rogue pterodactyl, Balloon Fight zaps players with lightning bolts from the clouds. Even though it's far from original, is Balloon Fight still a good game? Heck yes. And the Famicom Mini version brings the two-player mode back after omitting them from the e-Reader and Animal Crossing GBA editions, putting the link cable and Wireless Adapters to use. It's not quite the collectible because of its already-available-on-GBA status, but if you haven't already snagged it the first or second time, it's not a bad addition to the classic series.", "date": "Jun 4, 2004"}
