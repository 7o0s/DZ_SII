Even if the movie is a decade old. Mobile developer/publisher brings the ~Independence Day~ blockbuster out of retirement for a 3D jet fighter game that surprises by offering a fairly solid flight engine. You wouldn't expect that from an alien-crushing game based on a Will Smith movie. You'd expect some arcade-style controls that don't make you think about things like pitch and yaw.   Normally, this would be a huge boon. But I'm not sure that I want that sort of complexity out of an ID4 game.   You pilot a jet fighter over seven world cities, blasting alien ships from the sky as they buzz between the skyscrapers. However, these ships are the smallest quarries of your hunt. Motherships (called ~City Destroyers~) hover over each city, ripping the buildings apart with the blue death rays that made people ~ooh~ and ~aah~ when the first saw the original trailers for the movie so long ago. The motherships have been infected by a computer virus (man, that was such a lame plot development), so their shields are down. You must eat away at the hull integrity while avoiding laser fire from the small crafts. With each successive city, this task becomes harder. More ships fill the skies, they become better shots, etc.   You have two weapons to use against the alien threat: your machineguns and homing missiles. Missiles are a precious commodity, so use them sparingly.   ID4 offers a pretty solid mobile jet fighter experience. You cannot just zip all over the sky. You have to plan your turns in advance, because these flying machines don't corner on a dime. If you try to chase an alien ship as it swoops low over the streets, you can find yourself titled diagonally in a position that is difficult to recover from. Naturally, the plane is always moving, but you do have a throttle up button that juices you with a little extra speed. This speed makes it easier to get out of tricky situations, but you cannot engage it too close to skyscrapers, because your turning abilities are decreased with the extra velocity.   Now, I cannot deny that this impresses me, even if I didn't especially like it. But, then again, I've never been a big fan of flight games like Namco's Ace Combat franchise. I'm more of an After Burner kind of guy. But I have no problem overlooking my own prejudices to recognize Superscape's skill at developing a good flight game engine. Fans of that type of game should really get into ID4.   Admittedly, the action does become a little repetitive. Shoot alien ships in the sky, blast crawlers off of buildings, and then target the mothership -- rinse and repeat seven times.   ID4's 3D is solid, if not unspectacular. The detail of the buildings and alien ships leaves a lot to be desired, but the geometry is certainly good. The scaling of the buildings as you pass between them is appropriate, and the motherships are hulking in comparison to your fighter. The game does not feature any assets beyond the general theme and look of things -- there are no appearances from Will Smith or Jeff ~Jeff Goldblum~ Goldblum.ID4 serves the segment of the mobile gaming populace that desires a realistic-feeling flight game, even if the targets in your dogfights are from a guilty pleasure sci-fi flick. While I never really ~got into~ the game, I certainly was able to admire what Superscape accomplished with the controls and feeling of flight. I wished the environments were a little more detailed and the alien ships looked a little better, especially from a distance. But with seven levels full of alien-blasting dogfightrs, ID4 is a decent value. I recommend it for fans of this type of game, even if that isn't me.", "date": "Aug 18, 2005"}
