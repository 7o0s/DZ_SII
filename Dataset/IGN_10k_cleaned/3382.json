Well, for one thing, people wouldn't still be imagining how they would line up their oddly shaped kitchen floor tiles as if they were falling from the sky. Block-ular insanity aside, Tetris brought puzzle gaming into the lives of practically everyone in the free world. Small children whined countless hours as their mothers said ~Just one more game,~ until the batteries in little Johnny's GameBoy finally gave out.   Since Tetris was released oh-so-many moons ago, a rash of simple to learn, yet hard to master puzzle games have crept forth and helped waste an innumerable amount of hours at the hands of the addicted. Some of these games have gone onto greatness, and for every great game that's received even a minutia of success, a hoard of wannabe clones have followed it. Far more often the case than not, the copycats fail to capture the addiction-forming fun as the original.   As lackluster as some of the clones may be, some of the worst puzzle games are those that try to drastically tweak the basic formula of a classic game. Occasionally, a game will come along that tweaks a classic in a way that pays off. Usually though, messing with a near-perfect recipe leads to complete disaster and/or boredom. Behold Super Bubble Pop.   Gameplay  Upon first hearing the name Super Bubble Pop, I expected something similar to Bust-A-Move, or something like it. Well, in Super Bubble Pop you are trying to line up three like-colored bubbles to have them pop, but the execution is much different than in the classic Taito game. In front of your character is a 9x9 grid that you can shoot bubbles down. The field has some randomly placed bubbles of assorted colors that will slowly inch their way towards you. If they make it all the way to your end, the game is over. Having three lined up horizontally or vertically will cause them to pop, with the ultimate goal being to clear the game field. But even a concept this rudimentary is thoroughly beaten to a pulp and left for dead in a cold dark alley. What's the problem? Where do I start is the real question.    First of all, lining up three bubbles horizontally is a feature that seems to have been more of an afterthought than a basic game feature. Let's look at an example to help illustrate this point. Say you have two red bubbles next to each other against the far end of the playing field. Shooting another red bubble next to either one will cause all three to pop. No problem there. But let's say that you have two red bubbles next to each other in the next to last line of the grid, with nothing next to either bubble.    Shooting a like-colored bubble to either side will cause the bubble to pass both red bubbles and hit the far wall. Ok, so now you should be able to shoot another red bubble down the same path so that it will line up with the two sitting next to each other, right? Wrong. If you shoot another bubble down the same path, it will slide under the one on the back wall. Shoot another ball and it will do the same. This game property makes it horrifically difficult to line up three balls horizontally. The only real time you can do this is when the bubbles are lined up against the far end, and that's not good. You could also shoot six bubbles down the same path so that they stack up on top of each other. Because six is the limit of vertically stacked bubbles, the seventh will finally rest on the line ahead, making horizontal pops possible. It's just too bad that this is counter-intuitive with regards to the purpose of the game -- to clear the field, not build it up. Yuck.    Also, with horizontal pops being more or less out of the question, you are left mainly with vertical pops. This makes the majority of your gaming experience looking at the color bubble you have, finding a path with the same colored bubble, and shooting it down towards it. Repeat again, again, and again. No strategy, no skill, no fun. It's actually a lot like George Jetson's job at Spacely Sprockets. Push the shoot button, move the stick (maybe), push the shoot button, etc. I can't imagine that this would any fun for anyone, unless they were attempting to learn the different colors of the rainbow. Even then I could only assume that they would have more fun and be better educated with a pack of Skittles.    All right, so the game's got a few extra features that attempt to make the game more interesting, but do they really help make the game more enjoyable? I think not. You have special moves that you can perform such as flipping columns of bubbles, or color swapping, but there's rarely a time that you need to, or want to use these. Also, each one of the five ~DJs~ has a super move that will clear the entire playing field. You can also pick up level tokens and extra time, but the game never really changes or becomes interesting.   Graphics  There are really only a handful of graphical elements to the game. There's the transparent grid that everything sits on, the colored balls, a few icons, the DJ you're playing as and some random visual glitz to fill the screen. The transparent grid is in fact transparent. That works at least. The colored balls also look reasonably detailed for a PSOne game, until you realize that they're just sprites. Then you begin to notice that they don't scale smoothly and that they look more flat than they should as the playing grid rotates slightly as you play.   Upon realizing that the balls are just sprites, you begin to wonder where the polygons went. The DJs aren't very detailed, even for a PSOne game, and their animation is very twitchy. The rest of the screen is filled with random colorful shapes and whatnot, similar to a screensaver, though not as interesting as 99% of them. Overall, this is a pretty poor looking game, even considering the system.   Sound  You'd think a game with a bunch of DJs would have some decent music. Instead, what we have here is some of the worst ~dance~ music ever -- generic, irritating, and just plain bad. Rather than listening to the music, I suggest you go into the Jukebox and read the song names -- it is a much more enjoyable experience. Who could not love song titles like ~Bubble Builder Shanty~ or ~Journey to Planet DJ~ or, my favorite, ~Perfect Special Moment.~ What sound effects there are don't fare any better and should be turned off when possible.   Super Bubble Pop is not the poor man's puzzle game; it's the ~Not only am I broke, I'm in major debt~ man's puzzle game. This game is not worth the price of purchase, and if you get if for free, sell it. If you're really hurting for a puzzler on Xbox, play Tetris. Otherwise, wait for something, anything else (hopefully a Puyo Puyo-based game, or an online Chu Chu Rocket). A complete bust.", "date": "Jan 17, 2003"}
