The game series was originally supposed to premiere as a platformer on the PlayStation, kept off the shelves due to its overwhelming crappiness. But, after a bit of character reworking, the series makes its debut as a Game Boy Advance action-shooter. The design is much like Gauntlet in the sense that it borrows many ideas from that classic arcade game, but Monster Force has quite a few design and control issues that make the game somewhat clumsy and frustrating to play. It's a better-than-average title for the system, but it could have been so much better if it was tweaked just a little bit beyond the final product. Features More than 35 levels Three available characters and one hidden Cartridge save (three slots) Link cable support for two players (multi-cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  The game puts players to the task of plowing through more than 35 levels of infested monster mazes by blasting enemies, destroying pumpkin roadblocks, locating teleporters, and uncovering keys to unlock passages. Destroying enemies and other stuff will award ~atom~ icons, and by destroying items in sequence you'll earn more atoms...these icons can be used to build up your characters abilities between rounds by purchasing power-ups. And by completing levels with the set quota (time limit and number of atoms), you earn awards which can unlock specials within the game.  Each of the three characters in the game has the same abilities, but the attributes are altered based on their monster personality. Wolfie is quick in movement but weak in attack, Frankie's packs quite a punch but ends up the slowest of the trio...and Drac's the ~middle of the road~ player. Must be the blood.  The package is very solid, with decent level designs that have challenging tasks to perform. The game's artwork is excellent, right down to the character animation and clever cutscenes that look like classic black-and-white film...with its ~pops,~ jitters, and hair in the lens. It's very clever and very appropriate presentation. The sound effects are limited, but the music is well rendered and appropriately spooky.  But as much as this game bears similar appearance and gameplay to the arcade Gauntlet, it has some pretty irritating issues in its gameplay. The ~camera~ annoyingly centers your character 99% of the time, basically taking away valuable screen real estate. If I'm running in a specific direction, I want to see as far ahead as possible, and with the camera centering your position, it's difficult to see the enemies or targets until they're right on top of you. Controls are equally frustrating because of something that seems like a bug: each character can run by holding the A button, but only if the character's already moving...holding down the A button and then pressing a direction won't work. While this may be intentional, it's extremely annoying when your character comes to a halt when he bumps into an obstacle (or if you just let up on the control pad), and he won't start running again until you let up on the Run button and press it again. Why do I have to keep pressing the A button to get this guy to run, if I'm already holding it down? It's not like the button's being used for something else...  And while we're happy with the game's link cable support for two player death match, this is an instance where the more would certainly be better. One-on-one deathmatch games never seem to be as interesting as a four-player free-for-all...and it would have been more beneficial if Digital Eclipse could have figured a way to get the maximum number of players involved. Monster Force looks wonderful, sounds great, and has a lot of extras, but it's the controls that hurt the enjoyment of this game. That ~sputtering~ run is downright irritating, and the locked-down camera gives off a feeling of claustrophobia since you honestly can't see more than six feet in any direction. Monster Force is a great idea marred by some poor choices in control implementation.", "date": "Aug 30, 2002"}
