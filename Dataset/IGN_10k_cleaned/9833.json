It's true  I've seen it happen before. This quirky little arcade action/platformer is so cute and accessible that couples have been known to enter into long-lasting relationships that ultimately lead to marriage, all because they first sat down together, with two controllers in hand, and co-operatively popped some 8-bit bubbles. How's that for some Lasting Appeal?   It's all about the two-player mode in Bubble Bobble, as you and a friend (or potential future spouse) take control of the dynamic dinosaur duo of Bub and Bob, a colorful pair of double dragons who are out to save their girlfriends. The ladies have been kidnapped and are being held hostage in the depths of the Cave of Monsters, which is functionally a huge well reaching down into the Earth, and stacked with 100 levels.   You progress downward through the levels by beating each baddie in each one. This is accomplished by first trapping the foes in burped-up bubbles (which Bub and Bob produce from their mouths when you press the B Button), and then bursting those bubbles by jumping on them or running them into your dino's spiked backside. It's an interesting ~Step 1, Step 2~ mechanic that's similar in ways to the method for first flipping and then kicking enemies out of the action in the original Mario Bros., but Bubble Bobble's bouncing bubbles offer much more depth than that.   Bubble Bobble's better when friends play together.  Because the bubbles also serve as transportation for Bub and Bob  you can bounce off the top of them by holding down the jump button, and use the added boost to reach higher, out-of-the-way platforms. That becomes a required technique in later levels, where vast expanses of open space hold no normal surfaces for you to run across and reach each enemy. And, while each successive stage is getting more and more difficult to get around, the enemies populating each one also get more and more vicious. Near the end of the adventure, it's a definite challenge to keep Bub and Bob alive long enough to trap and pop every foe.   Bubble Bobble isn't a visually impressive game, as its matte black backgrounds never give way to anything different even as the foreground platforms constantly change their color and layout. Its storyline elements, too  if you can really call them that  are limited to one or two screens bookending the adventure. But there's an undeniable charm to the audio aspect of Bubble Bobble's presentation, which is one of the catchiest looping bits of synthesized 8-bit sound you could ever hope to hear in the NES era. It's seriously just the same song, repeating over and over, again and again, but it gets stuck in your head and you can't help but love it. It's like candy for your ears.   And there are additional treats hidden within this otherwise straightforward arcade port as well, like multiple different endings and hidden tricks that you can uncover with enough dedication and time. Bubble Bobble is one of those old-school games that can be played and appreciated well for what it offers on the surface, but that also has hold of a whole subculture of dedicated fans that know all its many ins and outs. When a game that came out over 20 years ago still has a cult following playing it religiously today, you know it's probably worth your time to check out.Fans of the long-running puzzle series Bust-a-Move will no doubt recognize the characters of Bub and Bob  this is the game that first introduced the pair, years ago. And though some of the follow-ups to this original Bubble Bobble were less than stellar, and though some of the most recent of those follow-ups have been extremely less than stellar, there's no denying the lasting value and simple playability of this first ever adventure for the two little dinos. If you've got a boyfriend or girlfriend, invest the 500 Wii Points for a download of Bubble Bobble and ask him or her to play it along you  the two of you will have a blast. And if you don't have any significant other, well, download it even faster. You'll want to have it on hand and ready when the opportunity arises for you to pass that second Wiimote to your potential Player 2.", "date": "Jan 9, 2008"}
