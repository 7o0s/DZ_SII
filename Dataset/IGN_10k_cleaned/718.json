Codemasters has done nothing to hype the game, and there's basically no Internet buzz going about the product. That's why it was all the more stunning when the game snuck up and bit me on the ass with it's great mix of available races, cars, and tracks.   At no point does TOCA 2 try to be a Gran Turismo or a Ridge Racer, it just lays out the goods like a streaker at a high school pep rally, saying, ~Here's what I've got to offer, look if you must.~   Gameplay  The Touring Car championship is unique in that it's actually comprised of normal, mass-produced four-door 2-liter cars you could purchase at a local dealership, albeit supped up for racing. TOCA 2 offers a nice variety of race modes, from the quintessential aforementioned championship mode to the more arcade-styled challenge race. There's also the option to race in a support car championship, which puts you in the driver's seat of a couple of off-beat vehicles like an F-1 racer or a Ford Fiesta.   The championship is, like many racers, split into 3 tiers of difficulty (novice, intermediate, advanced); the higher the rank, the more tracks you'll play (and potentially unlock, but more on that later). However, that's where most similarities end. The actual championship progression goes something like this: Every racer takes a single, timed lap around the track to determine starting grid position. After that, a short, 2-lap Sprint race commences, and points are added to the winners. Then, the racers take another timed lap around the same course for the Featured race, where in the course of the 4 laps, a mandatory pit stop will keep things close. This 2-race style leads to a 9-track, 26-round tournament; the higher the difficulty, the more tracks you'll compete on at a time. Confused yet? Don't worry, once you start playing, you'll understand almost immediately.   Challenge races put you behind the wheel of the same cars you'd find in the championship mode, but slap on arcade physics and pat you on the butt to send you off. From there it's a checkpoint-to-checkpoint dash to ensure that you not only take first, but actually hit the waypoints in time. One small spinout or accident, and it could cost you the chance at the checkered flag.   Support Car mode, on the other hand is something a little different from the more traditional racing modes found in games. You begin by strapping yourself in a variety of offbeat vehicles in an effort to earn points to unlock more racers. The catch is, whatever car you pick will be matched up with 9 other identical cars (the only difference being pant job), all just as hungry to hit the finish line as you.   As diverse as the race modes are, the options are possibly even more detailed. Engine volume, CD music, effects, commentary and pit crew can all be adjusted. Graphics options like the 2-player screen split, the wrong way message, opponent names, hell even the friggin' mirror position can be adjusted. Toss in the ability to choose your language, and analog sensitivity, and you're set. The only glaring omission comes from the lack of map display option (which is absent from the game itself).   Graphics  TOCA 2's engine manages the toss some pretty visuals like lens flares and a decent framerate when one car is on the screen, but really begins to choke when more than 2 cars are on screen at the same time. In fact, just enabling the rear-view mirror on the smallest setting will nail you with a noticeable drop in frames. Plus, the draw distance, for sideline details in particular, is relatively close, leading to that unsightly popup that we all fear. Sure, the track view distance itself is nice and long, but the constant trees appearing out of nowhere, a half at a time, is a total distraction.   Overshadowing all of this, however are the amazing car models that look as good, or possibly even better than the poppa of sim car models, GT2 and the amazing internal views.   Reflection mapping is thrown off the backs off the cars, but you may never notice it because many of you will be stuck in one of the two cockpit views. TOCA 2 offers 4 viewpoints over all, a close chase, far chase, and two internal views: one from the driver's eyes, and another slightly over the left of right shoulder (depending on where the car manufacturer puts the steering wheel), between the driver and passenger head rests. The really cool thing about the cockpit views isn't the working rear view mirror or the AMAZING sound effects you'll hear from within it (more on that below), it's the fact that progressive bumps with opponents (and there will be many- voluntary or not) will lead to a increasingly cracked windshield, finally ending in a complete shatter. All around the edges, though, are shards of glass still attached to the rubber. It's the small details like these that show that Codemasters put some serious time into crafting a fantastic racer.   15 car companies are available for race, whether off the bat or unlocked through first, place finishes. Companies like Ford, Audi, TVR, Jaguar, Honda, Renault, Peugeot, and Nissan are all available and come trackside with some of the most beautiful models I've seen in a PlayStation racer, even when compared to R4 or GT2. However, neither racer can compete with TOCA 2's best car feature: damage. That's right, beautiful, beautiful damage. I'm not talking about just a changed texture when another car smacks yours, I'm talking bumper-falling-off, hood-crushing, frame-mangling damage. And it has to be seen to be believed.   Sound  The standard stock of racing noises is great here, but it's nothing new, that is until you step into the cockpit. Sure, most of the engines sound the same, no matter what car you pick, and the announcer's commentary is good, if a bit repetitive, but when you're in the cockpit, you're treated to aural candy the likes of which your ears may have never experienced in a racer. Skid off the track into gravel, and you're treated to the delectable sounds of shale bouncing up and grazing the underbelly of your baby. Likewise, slide into some wet grass, and you'll hear mud coating the guts of your racer- all in glorious surround.  TOCA 2, while specialized in it's racing experience absolutely has the balls to stand head-to-head with genre-specific racers like F1 '99, Colin McRae Rally, and even the venerable Gran Turismo and Ridge Racer series.
