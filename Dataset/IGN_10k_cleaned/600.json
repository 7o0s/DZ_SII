{"name": "Tunnel B-1", "name_review": "Tunnel B-1", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/01/31/tunnel-b-1", "text": "There are lots of different variables that all come together to make a great game. Graphics are important, certainly, but aren't always essential. You've got control, gameplay, and, lower down the importance ladder, sound and music. Tunnel B1 has most of these elements, and looks fantastic. Unfortunately, it's missing the number one most important part of any game: fun.   You are the lone gunner, sent into hostile territory to shoot whatever gets thrown at you and make the world safe again. It's a premise as old as dirt, or at least as old as Berzerk, and has proven especially popular in the more recent incarnation as Doom. Like Doom, Tunnel B1 is set in the first-person, but unlike Doom, which isn't really known for its plot to begin with, Tunnel B1 is severely lacking in substance.   Like late 1996's other pretty shooter, Slamscape, B1 looks great. In fact, it's one of the best looking PlayStation titles available. The textured rock walls and surroundings are absolutely gorgeous, and the game clips along at a wonderfully fast frame rate. Moving down the tunnels and corridors, you really do feel like you're moving forward. There's even a realistic ricochet effect when you bounce off a wall at high speeds.   However, once you realize you're never going to get out of these endlessly branching tunnels and corridors, you begin to realize just how thin this game actually is. You can only drive around and shoot at helicopters and vans for so long without just getting bored and walking away. And this is where Tunnel B1 ultimately fails, and any notion of pretty graphics or fast frame rate gets negated: it's just plain boring.", "date": "Jan 31, 1997"}
