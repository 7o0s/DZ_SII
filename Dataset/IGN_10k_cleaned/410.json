{"name": "Pac-Man World", "name_review": "Pac Man World 20th Anniversary", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/16/pac-man-world-20th-anniversary", "text": "It has been twenty years since Pac-Man gobbled his way into the hearts of the Me Generation (Namco actually has opened up this gift a bit shy of his twentieth birthday, but who's counting?). In that time, there have been dozens of attempts to cash in on the Pac's popularity, but the half dozen sequels and knock-offs just didn't do the Roly-Poly One justice. Finally, just when it seemed that poor Pac was to be doomed to sharing compilation disc space with a handful of antediluvian derelicts, Namco has reinvented and reinvigorated their original leading man in Pac-Man World Twentieth Anniversary. Although the Pac's new birthday suit isn't quite as nice as the ones sported by 'Puff Daddy' Sonic or Mr. 'Guicci' Mario, this old man's party is still something to celebrate. Gameplay Pac-Man World has a storyline that is quite fitting for a videogame: somebody has kidnapped Pac's family, and he must go on a quest to rescue them. There's a bit more to it (a wanna-be Pac-Man cyborg has become jealous of Pac's fame and is looking to push him out of the spotlight), but there is nothing keeping you from just slapping the start button and running your way through the game.  All of the anniversary hub-bub and standard-issue storyline set-up is quite simply just quick foundation for the platformer standing on top. The game is designed to be a game, a visual and visceral experience. In this, the game is done right. After a short introductory level, the game brings you to a hub system to explore the rest of the game. This hub design is being used quite a bit in games as of late, and with good reason -- it invites gamers to explore the game over and over, and it draws attention to the fact that the title is much more about gameplay rather than a linear story. Pac-Man World's hub is engaging right off the bat, as there are already four levels open right when you get there (most games unlock each level as you progress), and they all have unique settings (including a Star Wars-like space stage) that show off just how big the game will become as you get closer to the evil Toc-Man's lair.  Gameplay in Pac-Man World is more the cousin of 16-bit Super Mario World rather than Super Mario 64 (anybody catch the name similarities?). Although much of the game is polygonal, it feels like you are still playing a 2D game with some background effects. That's not a terrible thing, as the game is filled with all kinds of puzzles and plenty of action, but it's not quite as revolutionary as the 64-bit wonder. There are a lot of nooks and crannies to explore in each level, but they still run from point A to point B, and the only reason to backtrack is to get 100% on the stage. Then again, if this type of gaming is good enough for Crash, it's certainly good enough for Pac-Man.  What's so great about the game is that while just simple platformer action, it is really well done. Pac-Man doesn't have a lot of moves, but the ones he has are fitting for a character who is basically just a happy fun ball with arms. His butt-bounce is his most valuable weapon, as it doubles his jump, destroy most enemies (and collects bonus points when he collects combos on enemies), and also becomes his most important tool for puzzle-solving. Pac also can throw dots and turn into Chrome Pac, and he has a Sonic-style spin dash which also revs up the game's many floating platforms. Aside from that, he's on his own. There are items to collect, but most of them just impact your score. That's right, I said score. One of the game's greatest charms is that you are constantly looking to not only collect a bunch of stuff, but also rack up a high score in the process. That's about as rare today as a roast turkey power-up, and it's high time that someone has brought scoring back.  Also of note is that the game has several Pac-style mazes that you unlock as you progress. These stages are designed to be just like the original Pac-Man game, complete with Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clide in chase. Here, you cannot use your butt-bounce or any other platformer trick (which is odd, as the controls are suddenly changed), but the classic Pac attack gameplay is still fun. Better still, the unlocked stages open up on the main menu, and you can lay them any time you wish (and yes, the original Pac-Man arcade game is thrown in with all original graphics). Graphics Again, not so breathtaking compared to everything else out there, but still charming and colorful. Like the control, the stages look like an isometric 2D game (Sonic Spin Dash) except really good looking, for once. The textures are crisp and clean, and only the sub-par lighting effects (such as torches that light up only specific triangles in the background or the dark tunnel areas that allow only about six inches of visibility) betray this enchanting world. There are a lot of sprites used in the game, but they are sharp and fit the style well.  Pac-Man himself is just overflowing with charisma, and the rest of the characters are similarly well-rendered. Unfortunately, the ghosts of the game aren't quite given their due. While they are constantly donning new suits that fit the stage they are in (space helmets, pirate outfits with eye patches), they just aren't given that much screen time considering that they were the only other stars of the original. The rest of the enemies of the game just don't rate compared to this goofy yet menacing ghost gang.  It's just remarkable that this 3D game reminds so much of the original, which had about 8 colors to work with. Menu screens, the Weigh-In Machine, and the bold use of primary colors is 100% Eighties silliness at its best. Strangely, only the specially-designed mazes disappoint, as the highly-detailed texture maps and fluid animation is just no match for the simple yet elegant design of the primitive arcade game it emulates. No amount of detail can outweigh sheer creativity. Sound Sound is similarly stylized, and it works perfectly. The sound effects are all bleeps and bloops, remixed and remastered for today's gamer. The timeless wakka-wakka is back. It's all very bold and cartoony, but in a way that is clearly in the realm of videogaming legend. The music is also very good, as the tracks are all variations on the Pac-Man theme (some are quite clever, especially the mystery theme). The only issue here is that the music sounds somewhat low-res and muted, like it was compressed to fit the PlayStation's limited memory. When the tracks are this good, they deserve better treatment.A lot has happened in gaming over the past twenty years. So much, in fact, that this Pac adventure really seems much more like a 15th anniversary than anything else. But a good game is something to be celebrated, and while Namco has left some rough edges here and there, the past misadventures of Pac-Man can now be forgotten. Finally, somebody has made a game really shows off just who character Pac-Man is -- a big, yellow, grinning ball of fun.", "date": "Nov 16, 1999"}
