{"name": "dothack//GU 3", "name_review": ".hack//G.U. Vol.3//Redemption", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/05/hackgu-vol3redemption", "text": "In the two previous G.U. games players got to know Haseo, a one man showstopper with the ability to take out anyone who got in his way in the online MMORPG ~The World~. Now Haseo is back for his final showdown with AIDA, a virus malware that is eating away at his beloved game and causing his friends to fall into comas in real life.    The last game in the G.U. series follows the same pattern as its predecessor Reminisce: new areas of ~The World~ have opened up, new quests are available, and new party members join the team. Haseo acquires a new job skill as well, which changes his look and lets him use duel pistols as a weapon. Haseo can also snatch virus cores from enemies, which will upgrade your party's final weapons. Unfortunately, the low enemy count in the series makes harvesting these virus cores tedious business, but it's worth it just to get the most powerful weapons in the game.      In addition to new quests and weapons, Haseo can race around more areas on his steam bike, participate in more arena battles and interact more with NPCs. And like in other .hack games, save data from the previous two games can be transferred so that you'll have an advantage in terms of items and armor going into Redemption (though you can start the game without it and still be fine).   The most noticeable difference however is the increase in actual online gameplay. Since there are now three major hubs that allow you to go to dozens of locations in ~The World~, you'll have an easier time leveling up and more fun exploring areas. It's a shame that the dungeons still have a low enemy count, but since Redemption requires you to participate in lots of battles and dungeon exploration there's not as much repetition and backtracking as in the pervious G.U. titles.   Haseo rocks a new look. These improvements are much appreciated, but there are still some issues that pop up in Redemption. For one, the Avatar battle mode hasn't changed at all. It's still a button smashing event that requires little strategy. This is really a shame because Avatars are important to the main storyline and so should have been more incorporated into the gameplay. Meanwhile the offline card game Crimson Vs still doesn't reward you with any special abilities, which as previously mentioned in our Reminisce review makes it kind of pointless. Finally, there was a weird incident towards the end of the game where a character was talking but the text at the bottom didn't match their words. Granted it might have a problem with the disk and not an in-game bug, but it still caused us to raise our eyebrows.  Overall the G.U. series has had a lot of ups and downs. The graphics are solid, the music is wonderful, and the battle system is much improved. Unfortunately it has too much recycling of dungeons and events, not enough online gameplay, and comes off more as an interactive anime series than a video game series. .hack fans may not mind that, but the rest of us might be better off logging out of ~The World~.", "date": "Oct 5, 2007"}
