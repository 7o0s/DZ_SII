After the buyout, many of JAMDAT's sports offerings were subverted in favor of EA Sports' catalog such as Madden NFL, but last year, JAMDAT Sports MLB still made it the cut. And it was good. IGN Wireless even labeled it the best mobile sports game of 2006.   This year, however, EA Mobile replaced the series with the expected EA Sports MVP Baseball 07. But instead of building on the successful and incredibly playable franchise, the franchise seemingly takes a huge step backward in a number of categories. This is is a strange phenom in the face of increased competition from what is now the best baseball game on the decks: Gameloft's Derek Jeter Pro Baseball 2007.   The first thing you'll notice about MVP Baseball is the lack of the official MLB license. MVP's teams go by city names and feature no-name players, although it appears that they did make an effort to line up team stats with their real-world counterparts. Anaheim, for example, is a powerhouse while Baltimore slumps. There are no licensed uniforms or stadiums, either. Everything is generic -- and while I can appreciate not paying for the MLB license, it's too bad that the generic atmosphere pervades the entire production.   Player models are bland and lacking in animation. The batter appears to have just a few frames as he swings. When the ball flies into the outfield, the fielders are terribly small and non-descript. Base runners bound between plates like Pitfall Harry sprites. A struck ball stutters across the screen. The color palette seems muted. The stadiums lack personality. This does not look like a 2007 game. This is straight 2004. To quote Mike LaFontaine (Fred Willard) from A Mighty Wind: ~Wha' happened?~      The actual game play suffers from the same sense of time travel. For one thing, the game is too easy, even on the medium difficulty, labeled ~Pro~ here. In one inning, I kid you not, I scored 12 runs by just pressing up to perform a power swing over and over. No fatigue, no mistakes. I kept either bombing them out of the park or sending them right into the center of the outfield. While a handful of Pitfall Harrys scrambled for the ball, I quickly rounded the bases using 2, 4, and 8. I was never tagged out because the ball moves slow enough for you to not mistakenly advance to the next plate.   Pitching and fielding aren't much better. Each pitcher has a selection of pitches; you choose a pitch by pressing the directional pad in the pitch's corresponding direction. You can then move the pitch around a box next to the batter, click a meter, and easily psyche the batter out. Should the batter actually manage a hit, the molasses fielding just isn't exciting. You simply move your player beneath the slow-dropping ball. Your players will make occasional errors and drop the ball, but there is no cue that the error happened. No chime. No nothing. You just realize that when you tried to throw to second, nothing happened.   Speaking of sound -- are there maybe four effects in this game? Hitting the ball sounds almost the same as throwing it to the second baseman. Every once in a while the monotony is punctuated by a staple ballpark riff on a canned organ.   MVP offers three play modes: Quick Game, Exhibition, and Series. Quick Game and Exhibition let you jump in and play a few fast innings. The Series mode lets you choose your team and then either 3, 5, or 7 games. A stat-tracking feature ticks off your runs, hits, etc.   (3-22-07 Note: I incorrectly stated that PhoenixSoft was a new developer for MVP Baseball. PhoenixSoft has developed baseball games for JAMDAT in the past. Also, I tested the game on a Sony Ericcson w810i.)  After about fifteen minutes of play, I couldn't believe what EA Mobile had done to the once-proud JAMDAT Sports franchise. Ditching the league license is fine, but to throw out all the great presentation and game mechanics is just baffling. This pinch hitter should have never left the dugout. MVP never picked up as I struggled through a few series to see if my first impression was somehow off. Nope. This baseball game is too slow, too easy, and too generic to bear the MVP name. Or the EA Mobile name, for that matter, a company that usually publishes much, much better -- such as the recent NASCAR games. If you're looking for some mobile baseball, do not buy this game.", "date": "Mar 21, 2007"}
