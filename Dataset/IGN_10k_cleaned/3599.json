Why must it always be like Doom? I guess that's better than it always being like Cosmic Race. But come on people, enough's enough!  Kileak The DNA Imperative (originally released in Japan as Kileak: The Blood) is your standard first-person shooter fare, complete with underground caves and labyrinthine tunnels. The graphics are detailed and full, with enemies realized in 3-D for that scary, in-your-face feel. Corridors and rooms move fluidly and smoothly as well.  Unfortunately, the game just isn't that fun. The first five levels are all very homogeneous, with similar enemies and detailing. There isn't much interaction with your surroundings either - sure there's lots to look at, but that's as much as you're gonna be able to do with it. Kileak does deserve some credit for taking the action beyond mere shooting. Puzzles and keys to find add some variation to the gameplay, but it's pretty much a case of too little too late. Ultimately, Kileak doesn't stand up to its (more famous) predecessor.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
