Still, being one of the biggest definitely doesn't make you infallible, as proven by the company's latest effort: WTA Tour Tennis. This game, the first tennis title to hit the GBA, doesn't match the quality of other tennis games on lesser-capable handhelds.  Mario Tennis on the Game Boy Color and Pocket Tennis on the NeoGeo Pocket Color were much more impressive offerings. Features 20 female tennis pros Exhibition and Tour modes Cartridge save (quick save and tour save) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridges required) Only for Game Boy Advance  Konami's taking a huge risk by securing an all-women/only-women tennis license to wrap around its first GBA tennis design, so kudos to them. WTA Tour Tennis has twenty different real-life tennis pros shrunk down to super-deformed stature, from Jennifer Capriati to Monica Seles. Oddly, while Serena Williams is in this game, Venus Williams has been left out of the line-up. Each of these players has her own attributes, from speed to power, but the sprite representations when they get out on the courts make everyone look like the same darn person...aside from a bit of palette swapping for skin tone and clothing color, of course.  There isn't a whole lot to the overall design, which hurts the game's lasting appeal. Players can play exhibition rounds in singles or doubles, or play a full-on world tour with a single tennis pro. If you can locate three additional copies of the game you can play against other players on other systems. But that's it...there are no practice mini-games, no building up player attributes, or any other gaming modes to speak of. It's a cut-and-dry design.  But this could be forgiven if the actual tennis game held its own with a good engine, but even here WTA Tour Tennis doesn't really stand up.  The graphics, from the flat court designs to the basic character animations, are barely above what tennis designers did on the Game Boy Color system. The actual gameplay is easy to pick up, admittedly, with solid controls...but it's almost too easy to keep volleys going since you don't have to be accurate with timing your swings. All that's necessary is to anticipate where the ball is going and hold down the A button to return the shot. There are several moments in any given volley where the ball will visibly travel through the net. And there is a huge gap in the computer AI that's incredibly easy to exploit, making the game a snap to win...all players have to do is advance the net on an opposing player's serve, and they can place the return so far out of reach of the server that it will always score a point.   On the plus side, games can be quick-saved between volleys, which makes WTA Tour Tennis a friendly handheld game. The cartridge save also records the player's standings in the world circuit, and basic match-up information that tells how many times the players have won or lost against a specific tennis pro. But it doesn't record settings in the options menu...players can choose to change the camera to have it so the viewpoint keeps the player's character always on the close side of the net, but this setting won't stick if you turn off the system.  You'd think that a GBA tennis game would at least look more impressive than what was offered on the Game Boy Color...and with the power of the system, you'd expect it to at least match the offerings on the Super NES. Konami's tennis game doesn't come anywhere close to Mario Tennis on GBC or even Super Tennis on the SNES...I can't say for sure if this game's main focus is the younger girl crowd, because it at least looks like it's trying to take itself a bit seriously with its license. But the overall package is a real disappointment for the first tennis game on the handheld...there will be others. Plenty of others. I suggest you wait for something better to come along.", "date": "Jun 25, 2002"}
