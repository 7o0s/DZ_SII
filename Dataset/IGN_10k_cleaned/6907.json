One of the more captivating arcade titles to come along since NBA Jam, Ballers was even a runner up for Game of the Month honors.  Now this critically acclaimed title crosses over to the PSP with NBA Ballers: Rebound, a repackaged version of the console title for the handheld.  Unfortunately, some of the PSP's limitations hamper the clean translation for the portable version, tripping it up from being an absolute dunk for basketball fans.   For the most part, Rebound plays exactly like that of its console counterpart, with most matches set by whoever wins two out of three rounds by scoring 11 points first.  A number of secondary conditions might be placed upon a game, such as keeping an opponent under a certain number of points, whoever makes it takes it, or having more steals than your opponent.  Most of the time, you'll square off against the computer in either Quickplay or Versus modes, although there are a few matches where you'll have to go up against an additional player in the 1 Vs 1 Vs 1 match (which feels much more like playing 21 on a school yard because everyone fends for themselves.)    Initially the number of players available to you in these matches is capped off, but you can unlock additional stars by entering and winning competitions in the TV Tournament mode.  Broken up into episodes, the TV Tournament mode will give you the option to challenge and defeat legendary basketball stars and current players in the league (thanks to a later development cycle, Rebound has the latest roster updates from November of last year).  Doing so makes them available as playable characters, as well as provides you with points that can be spent in the Inside Stuff game area to acquire various items or collectables.  These range from homes and cars to friends and magazine covers.   Unfortunately, here's one of the places where the PSP's limitations kicks in, as Rebound simply doesn't have the same amount of unlockable content that the console version does thanks to the constraints of the UMD.  It may seem like a petty gripe, but when you consider that this is the exact same game, the lack of content really does stand out to players of the first title.  Fortunately, for players who've spent a large amount of time with the Phrase-ology section and pre-game code section, you'll be glad to know that a majority of the codes (and code words) from the first do work in this game.    The primary thrust of Rebound remains the Rags to Riches mode, which takes an unknown player created character and pits them against basketball players to earn fame, money and prizes.  At first, your baller's skills are relatively basic, but as time goes on, you can customize their abilities with special moves, allowing them to perform stunt dunks, ally oops or replenish their juice meter twice as fast (which is used for turbo and trick moves).  You'll also be able to pimp out these characters with new clothes, jewelry and other accessories to make them look even more flamboyant when they blow past a defender.  Making your opponent look foolish with a variety of trick moves was a major part of Ballers when it graced the consoles and the same concept applies in Rebound, with the option to taunt players, ~act a fool~ and even ~bring down the house~ by breaking the backboard making its way to the portable.      There are two problems with the gameplay, however.  The first issue is that the game's control scheme really was designed to work with two analog sticks, which the PSP unfortunately doesn't have.  For instance, the instruction manual simply says that you hit the square button to pull off one of thirty different juke moves.  Unfortunately, doing so often results in your baller constantly pulling off the same trick over and over again.  This makes it easy for your opponent to steal the ball away from you, and it decreases the amount of points you get from each move. Considering the amount of money you get to customize your player is based on how many points you accumulate thanks to trick moves and other stats from the game, you can actually wind up hampering the development of your baller because of the imprecise controls.   The second issue with Rebound comes from the incomprehensible load times that the game features.  The game took more than 24 seconds to load the menu screen from the initial splash screen that states ~Press Start Button.~  This, mind you, is after a fair half minute or so of preliminary loading before it even launched the Midway logo.  Matches don't fare any better, with a quickplay session taking a full minute or more before you can actually start the game.  Obviously, these are the farthest thing from ~quickplays~ with such exorbitant waits for any feature of the game, and while they were somewhat tolerable on the consoles, these are horrendous on the PSP.  In fact, they really hamper the interest you have in customizing a character as there can be a 15 second lag between clothing categories, not to mention minor hiccups or hitches with music loads.    It would be particularly understandable if the visuals were optimized for the PSP, but they're not.  It's practically the same visuals from the console title, which still includes the camera glitches from the original game.  Unfortunately, thanks to the PSP's screen, these issues really stand out like a sore thumb when you experience them in play.  There are a couple of details on courts that have degraded somewhat, solely because the PSP probably couldn't handle the full port.  That being said, there are a number of new courts, and the game does still present some of the best visual recreations of NBA player's faces that we've seen in an extremely long time (in a current generation system, that is).  This is supported by the soundtrack and commentary from the console version, which is recreated rather well, albeit with some odd hiccups every now and then whenever the game loads new music tracks.   Multiplayer is handled in Rebound via Ad hoc play, and allows you to set a variety of customized rules, such as Mucho Juice (aka unlimited juice during a match), Dunkfest (where only dunks count for points) and Great Balls of Fire (which sets both players on fire for the entire match).  These are fun exclusive rules for multiplayer, but like the other rules within the single player game, you may find yourself tiring of these kinds of matches after a while.  Rebound does a solid job of recreating the experience of Ballers on the PSP, with many of the basic concepts and mechanics of the console game returning fairly intact.  Unfortunately for the portable version, a lack of additional content, system hampered controls and exorbitant load times really hinder the game for no apparent reason.  It's not a horrible game; it would be better if the game was redesigned with the PSP in mind, but Rebound comes across more like a limited console emulation version.", "date": "May 23, 2006"}
