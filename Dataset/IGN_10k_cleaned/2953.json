It starred a bunch of 'toons who attended the Looniversity in order to get their degree and supposedly go off to do their own shows, with the hopes of one day being as well-revered as the likes of Buggs Bunny or Daffy Duck. Although the show ended after only a few seasons, it was generally funny, and helped spawn some of the WB's other popular cartoons, like the Animaniacs.    Plucky's Big Adventure stars Plucky Duck, Buster Bunny, Babs Bunny, and Hamton from Tiny Toon Adventures. Plucky, being the slacker that he is, forgot to do his Looniversity homework. Instead of making up some lame excuse for not doing it, Plucky devises a plan to build a time machine out of his bike, travel back in time, and finish his homework. The plotline doesn't mention whether or not Plucky would unravel the space/time continuum if he handed his homework to himself, but Doc Brown's theory is a little too complicated for this game.   Gameplay   The game involves collecting 5 pieces that Plucky needs to finish his time machine, which are all located inside of the Looniversity. Plucky gets the first two himself, followed by Hamton, Babs, and Buster collecting one each. The tasks normally require getting other objects, and are then supposed to require a bit of puzzle solving to finally get the item needed. The problem with the puzzle solving is that the game is so obvious in what needs to be done, that all it really boils down to is picking up one object and taking it somewhere else. There was only a span of about 5 minutes where I didn't know exactly what I should be doing, even if that meant that I was just searching random desks or stacks of film for something that I hadn't obtained yet. This game is supposedly targeted for children, but any living creature that is capable of walking and chewing gun at the same time should be able to finish the game with no trouble at all.   To make matters worse, or in other words, annoying, the characters can only hold two items at a time. Everything else must be stored in their locker. There are many puzzles where a key must be used to open a door, only to find that a hammer is needed to do the next step, so a trip back to the locker is necessary is needed to pick up the hammer. Item management in games usually adds a nice bit of strategy and necessary planning, but here it just becomes irritating. Half the time spent finishing the game is just walking back and forth from the lockers in order to switch items. To add insult to injury, each character has their own locker, designated by four different colors. A different combination is needed to open each locker, which must be set every time you want open them. Luckily, items are shared between lockers, so an item placed in one will appear in the other three, or that could have been a nightmare. Though oddly, characters can open lockers that aren't their own, so I just ended up using Buster's locker for the entire game since his combination was the fastest and least of a hassle to dial in. Having combinations for the locks is also completely pointless, as the codes are just listed in the manual and on a bulletin board in-game, so it's not as if they need to be found first.   The control in this game is passable, at least as far as movement is concerned. Moving the characters around the halls of the Looniversity is easy, and works about as well as one would expect. All four characters seem to move about the same, with the exception of Hamton. He's a portly fellow, so his turns are more arced and thereby seemed more fluid than anyone else. The button controls for the game are pretty nonsensical. The X button is for using an object, and the O button is used to view an object. The problem is that some things you find need to be used, and some need to be viewed in order to search or use it. For example, an open desk needs to be viewed, but a cabinet with a drawer needs to be used in order to look inside. This often leads to having to press both buttons to see if anything is to be found, each followed by a message and an annoying buzzer sound if nothing was there. The only other button of use in the game is R1, which switches between the two objects in the character's hands or to use nothing.   The only things impeding the way of the player are Elmyra Duff and Montana Max. They wonder the hallways, but luckily not the rooms where objects are, and will try to capture Plucky and company. If either Elmyra or Montana grabs hold of one of the characters, jiggling the controller will set them free. The characters get worn down over time, and eventually Elmyra or Montana will capture them. One of the other characters must then be used to rescue the captured victim. If Plucky is ever captured, the game is over.  Elmyra and Montana are fairly easy to avoid, and are really just more annoying than hazardous.      Another low point of the game is it's attempt at something called ~humor.~ You may have heard of it, but the designers certainly haven't. Any game that includes a bad version of the Budweiser ~Waaassuuuup!~ ad is doomed. Some of the jokes are so bad that players may find themselves staring at the screen in awe, wondering how anybody thought that these jokes were worth the time to type. There are a couple that come close to being somewhat funny, but overall, they're terrible and a complete waste of reading time.   Graphics   The graphics in the game are pretty bad, even for a PlayStation game. They may have been passable as a first generation title, but the machine has been fully tapped at this point, and it certainly doesn't show here. The characters are half-decent 3D versions of their animated selves, but some of their proportions are off, such as Plucky's head being way too big, for example. The rooms in the game are pretty bare looking, but generally serve their purpose. The camera itself only actually moves left and right while in the hallways, so the backgrounds likely should have been 2D drawings, which would have matched the show better and would have allowed more details for the characters.   The animation is actually what makes the game's graphics so horrible. Characters walk around with a very low number of frames in their animation, so their walk cycles look very jerky. Sadly, their walk cycle is one of the only bits of movement they ever do. If a character is not moved for a little while, they may scratch their head or something similar, and at one point they have an animation to walk up a ladder, which itself is horrid. They're also animated when they talk, even there's no sound, but there aren't any accompanying animations for using any of the objects. Some result in a cloud of smoke, which once gone reveals the newly shaped item, but the lack of character interaction with objects makes the game feel extremely stale. Being as this game is based on an animated TV show, the animation should have been one of the top priorities, and it's lack thereof really hurts this title's appearance.   Sound   The game's soundtrack is one of the only things that reach the amazing level of mediocrity. The music is somewhat catchy, but not really all that memorable. Every other bit of sound in the game, what there is of it, borders on terrible at best. A buzzing sound accompanies a failed search of an object, and a repetitive ding accompanies a successful find or use of an object. What's worse is the sound that isn't there, namely speech. The show has been over for a while, so the original voice actors might have been busy during development. But there are other people in the world that could have done a decent job at the matching the original voices and should have been hired to do so.  Games based on cartoons have always been a shady bunch. Most of them have been mediocre at best, and some are downright terrible. It's easy for a publisher to take advantage of the fact that by strapping a popular brand on a game it will sell well, regardless of whether it's worth the plastic it's pressed on. This is the case for many games based on movies and television shows, cartoons included.Plucky's Big Adventure is an abomination of a game. The jokes fall extremely flat, the puzzles are incredibly easy, and there's hardly any animation. The game wasn't ever frustrating, like many bad (and even some good) games can be, but it was probably the most boring three hours of my life. Picking your nose is more fun than this game, and at least you'll feel like you've accomplished something once you've finished. Unless you happen to be extremely rich and like to watch CDs sparkle in your microwave, do not even consider buying this game, not even for the kids in the house.As an additional note, this game has one of the worst endings I have ever seen in a game, including stuff from the Atari 2600. I'm assuming it was thrown together within an hour or so. The end credits probably run for about 40 times as long as the end did, and the credits only run for a few minutes. You do the math on that one.", "date": "Sep 20, 2002"}
