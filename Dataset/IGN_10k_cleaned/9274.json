For portable fans the PSP version was the only option. For this year's sequel Thrillville: Off the Rails, LucasArts entrusted developer DC Studios with the Nintendo DS version, who managed to screw it up completely. Everything good about Thrillville is gone, turning the game from an E-ticket ride, to a kiddie park reject.   Nearly everything about the DS version of Thrillville: Off the Rails is different. While it does keep the general theme of putting some random kid in charge of an amusement part, and brings over the antagonist Globo-Joy, that's pretty much the end of the similarities. Globo-Joy, instead of being a shady organization run by a guy named Vernon, is a company run mostly buy clowns. Yeah, the bad guys are clowns. They try and stir up trouble by doing... clown things. Personally we can't see how adding clowns to an amusement park really detracts from the feeling already generated. Do clowns somehow cheapen the carnival games and miniature golf? Or maybe they clash with the funhouse, which already has a giant clown on it? Regardless, they cause mayhem, and the player has to lay the smackdown, by way of minigame challenges and building wicked sweet coasters, but not by throwing pies.   The only cutscenes are those of the Globo-Joy corporate board room. The evil clowns constantly try to think up new ways to take down the park. It's odd that the only cutscenes, simple as they may be, are from the bad guys' perspective. When the player converses with people, it's all talking heads within the game screen. The writing is actually pretty good and there are a handful of funny moments within the game. It recognizes how silly its premise is and just goes with it.   Unlike the 3D version of Thrillville on every other system, the DS version is presented in an isometric view, reminiscent of all the great micromanagement classics. A quick glance gives the feeling of Roller Coaster Tycoon or Theme Park, but that feeling is quickly expelled like a queasy park-goer's stomach contents after riding the Tilt-a-Whirl.   Whee? Thrillville: Off the Rails is not a sim game. At all. It looks like one at first. There's money in the corner of the screen, and all the rides and attractions cost something, but it's never an issue. Besides physically building things, nothing ever costs money. There are no expenditures to keep the park running. Players can hire staff, but only have to pay for them once. Even when rides break down or the park gets overly messy it doesn't cost any money to fix it up. So even when we're playing at our worst - our park is in shambles and the Vampire mascot is trying to suck our guest's blood because he's gone insane - the money still goes up. If we do better, it just goes up faster. We can imagine that the developers may have been trying to keep the game simple since it's for kids, but that would be foolish thinking. Games like Sim Town simplified the process while still keeping the resource management aspect intact, and Thrillville could have easily incorporated something similar.   Who cares about micromanagement though, right? Thrillville is about designing coasters! Oh wait, the DS version doesn't really have that either. The coasters within Thrillville are predesigned, offering the player only a basic amount of customization. There are four coaster track types: steel, wood, water and inverted. Each type has four sizes: small, medium, large and X-large. Depending on what type and size of coaster is selected, certain pieces can be customized. Each coaster type has three types of pieces and those pieces can be customized in one of four ways. So after making over a dozen coasters, it really only felt like we had made five or so because they all feel the same.   So players can't micromanage an amusement park, and they can't design coasters from the ground up. Well what can they do? Play minigames. Thrillville as a series has boasted dozens of playable minigames. The DS version has a whopping... seven? Seven minigames is hardly worth putting on the back of the box, and certainly looks pretty poor next to the other versions. The PSP versions boasts over 30 multiplayer minigames. the minigames are the only point that the game becomes challenging, but not when it's actually necessary for the player to win them. when it affects the plot, the games are easy, and the harder modes only unlock superfluous toys that do nothing and require exiting the game to look at.   The isometric view works since the DS could hardly be expected to run a game this size in full 3D. They keep the feel of the amusement parks, and each one has a distinct feel with changing music and environments. But besides the 3D character models, which are ugly and deformed looking, the game is way too flat. We didn't even get a 3D view of riding any of the rides, one of the coolest aspects of the Thrillville series. Why even bother bringing the game out if it doesn't have one of the major selling points of the series.   The DS Thrillville obviously has DS specific elements, but they're so needless that it's actually more of a pain to use them. In the conversation modes, an interesting element where the player actually trash talks his or her way to victory, players draw loops or swirls to pick their response. The problem is the game doesn't seem to recognize the more basic lines, even though it easily gets the more complicated ones. Why couldn't we just tap our choice and move along?Obviously the DS version of Thrillville: Off the Rails can't do everything the console versions, or even the PSP version, can, but how did it manage to do none of them? Players don't get the chance to truly run a park, they can't design coasters, and they only get a small handful of minigames to play. Besides the single cart minigame option there isn't even anything DS specific that makes it stand out at all. Had the developers decided to focus on one of the game's aspects and make a fleshed out version, then Thrillville would have been at least a fun miniature version of the consol game. Instead, the mess we got is a broken ride.", "date": "Oct 19, 2007"}
