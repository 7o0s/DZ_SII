He's a brand. A very, very profitable brand that saw the next logical extension of his techno-thiller empire: video games. Splinter Cell went huge last year on Xbox, and the Rainbow Six Ghost Recon games sell by the boatload on the PC. Let's see. Console and PC that leaves only one gaming platform left.  Your phone.  Features: Eighteen levels set in three locations Three levels of difficulty Original storyline for cellphone game  You are an elite soldier sent on a suicide mission to thwart a terrorist takeover of the New York International Airport. First, you must sweep the control tower for bombs. Then a team is sent in to clear out the terminal. Finally, you deal with the terrorists directly inside a jet. It's an original story, created specifically for this game. This works well, because the story is designed to accommodate the lower-grade tech of a cellphone, as opposed to trying to squeeze some massive epic tale into a itty-bitty port.  Before you begin your mission, you can select a particular style for your soldier. Recon soldiers are more stealthy, as they're equipped with silenced submachine guns and a sidearm. Assault soldiers carry an assault rifle and flashbang grenades. Assault is ore of a middle ground, offering a decent mix of range and firepower. Heavy soldiers go in which guns a-blazin'. Equipped with a combat shotgun and a kevlar vest, Heavy troops come to kick fanny and chew bubblegum. You know the rest  As you infiltrate the airport you must diffuse bombs and cut down terrorists. Hold down ~0~ to diffuse a bomb, but make sure you have cleared out any nearby terrorists so they don't shoot you while your hands are busy. Pull the trigger with ~5,~ and move around with either the touch pad or number pad. Scroll through weapons with either ~#~ or ~8.~  Here's the first problem with Broken Wing. The control is kinda iffy. Not terribly responsive, and while the detailed levels are certainly appreciated, it's difficult to tell when you're able to cross behind an object or not. Several times we tried to duck behind a car, only to be held suspended while terrorists riddled us with bullets. No fun.  Second, the Rainbow Six games has a pretty decent stealth element to them. You will feel none of that here. Perhaps it's the clunky controls, perhaps it's just the general design of the game. But at no time do you feel particularly sneaky, since you have to often stand out in the open to get off a clear shot at a patrolling terrorist thug.  Visually, the game is a little behind Gameloft other Clancy effort, Splinter Cell. We mentioned the detailed environments, but they aren't as colorful or easy to navigate as they are in Splinter Cell. Your solider is short and thin, hardly the commando you'd want to steer into conflict unlike Sam Fisher. The bullets are traced by green lines. Kinda lame. As for the audio. Well, there is some. I can't help but be disappointed by Rainbow Six: Broken Wing. Perhaps I should have played it before I played Splinter Cell, which raised the bar for many handset games out there. The control is really off and you just can't get around the fact that you're not the least bit stealthy.If you're going to spend the cash on just one of two games for your cell a month, save it for Cell, unless you';ve abolsutely played that to death. And then consider some of Gameloft's other offerings, like Prince of Persia and Rayman 3 first.", "date": "Sep 24, 2003"}
