That fact doesn't inherently mean it's worth saving your Microsoft Points for another game, but with so many better alternatives out there, it's difficult to justify downloading this one.   Originally released in 1987 for the good ol' Macintosh, Crystal Quest has a simple, easy-to-grasp design. Fly your sphere around a rectangular map and collect all the crystals to open a gate at the bottom of the map. Once the gate is open, go through to the next level. In trying to do so, you'll have to battle against increasingly spastic and absurd opponents who spawn out of the walls, in addition to avoiding static mines.   The XBLA adaptation offers an updated version as well as the original. While the upgraded gun in the update is a welcome addition, there were a few questionable design decisions made. For instance, when implementing the shimmering graphics and additional detail of the newer version, somebody forgot to make sure the mines looked different than the crystals. As a result, unless you play games at a retina-searing distance of two feet from your television, you're going to experience some unnecessary death.   Sometimes it's hard being a ninja. Sound effects in both versions are laughable and lend a certain degree of humor to the game. This is particularly true of the rubber duck squeak sound that accompanies a successful crystal nab in the update. Underlying the gameplay in both is a down tempo electronic synth beat that manages to remain listenable despite a Geometry Wars-like loop frequency.    To get your name onto the leaderboards you'll definitely want to crank the difficulty up to ten. Though the easier settings let you bump into obstacles without exploding, feature less challenging enemies and give you more frequent extra lives, you'll get nowhere near enough points to make yourself known in the Crystal Quest community.   Bam! As you move through each level, or wave as they're called, you'll find the gate gets smaller and smaller until it actually starts moving around at wave 25. Crystal Quest's primary challenge is not necessarily shooting, but maneuvering. The sphere you control has an element of floaty physics that make it slide ever so slightly when you press in the opposite direction. While this adds an element of depth, it doesn't make it more fun.   Crystal Quest's issue is that it never manages to absorb all your attention and mental focus like Smash TV, Robotron 2084 or Geometry Wars. At their cores, these titles are all essentially the same game with minor differences, and the differences that set Crystal Quest apart just don't work as well. It may only be 400 Microsoft Points, but that's five bucks better spent on another game.", "date": "Feb 13, 2006"}
