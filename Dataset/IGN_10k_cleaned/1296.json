Exploiting the Austin Powers license for all that its worth, it has released two games that are virtually identical, the derivative and boring Oh Behave! and the derivative and boring Welcome to my Underground Lair, both developed by Tarantula Studios. While Oh Behave follows the exploits of one Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, in WTMUL the enigmatic Dr. Evil is the driver's seat, quite literally. You see, there is a stunt cycle game to be found here, if only you can get to it. Features Minigames and activities Extensive database of sound clips Battery back-up to save settings Printer support to print notes Link cable support for two players in certain games Infrared support to trade data and items Compatible with Austin Powers: Oh Behave! Only for Game Boy Color   WTMUL utilizes the same mock desktop that Oh Behave does. The game cart basically recreates the look and feel of a computer and must be navigated the same way. Simulating a Windows environment on the GBC does not translate well. Even with several evil desktops, screensavers and color options to tweak, I wasn't feeling the whole computer thing. Perhaps it was because I found it difficult to find anything I was looking for. Perhaps it was because I grew out of ~playing adult~ when I was about four. All that the wonky interface did for me was make me furious I couldn't find the real game, which is buried deep in a menu.  Not that the actual game, which is titled Kin-Evil is worth the wait. It isn't. A direct rip-off of Rockstar's own Evel Kneivel, this game features lame control and uninspired gameplay. The graphics are pretty top-notch, but I'm sure that won't stop you from turning the game off.  In addition to the cycling game, WTMUL sports a few more features. On the virtual GBC desktop, you can also choose between Programs and Games. Programs have such accessory-style applications as the Frickulator (a calculator), Evil Launch Pad (a rudimentary word processor) and a lame Internet ~program.~ The Internet application is nothing more than a fake browser with nothing but information about the Austin Powers series of movies.  Evil Launch Pad is interesting, allowing users to write and send messages to each other with either the Oh Behave or WTMUL carts (using the GBC's infrared), but you have to be too close for it to even be useful. In addition, the Pad allows you to print out messages with the Game Boy Printer. That is, if you can get it to work. When I attempted to print a message, it printed out gobbledyguck nowhere near what I had typed.  The mini-games are actually quite fun, offering choices between Rock/Paper/Scissors, Domination and Mojo Maze. Rock/Paper/Scissors pits you against an Austin Powers character in the classic game, either computer controlled or through link-up. I didn't think I'd live long enough to see this game converted into video format, but here it is. Trust me, it is no fun. Domination is basically Othello, so if you are a fan of the classic board game, you'll enjoy this. It does add value to a cart that might otherwise be plain awful.  Mojo Maze is probably the best thing on the cartridge, and is identical to the game in Oh Behave, except that you are controlling Dr. Evil here. A shameless rip-off of Pac-Man, the same rules apply. Run around a maze collecting icons while the ghosties chase you. Pick up the power icon and turn the tables on them. Of course, everything here is Evil-themed.   Welcome to My Underground Lair is shameless abuse of a license. Not only is it a near-direct copy of Oh Behave!, but a near-direct copy of Evel Knievel, a game which got a 2.0 from this very site. Let's put it this way: I'd rather drink what's in the beaker than play this game for an extended period of time. Welcome to My Underground Lair is shameless abuse of a license.
