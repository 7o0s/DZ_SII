Peter Molyneux promised a genre changing experience that would include branching storylines and a virtual world that would grow and change with the player. Back when we knew the game as Project Ego the famed developer went so far as to say that it would be ~greatest role-playing game of all time.~ Although the final build on the Xbox fell a bit short of these lofty goals it was still an excellent role playing game that was deserving of any self-respecting gamer's time and money.    Fast forward a year after the Xbox release and Lionhead Studios has graced us with an enhanced version of Fable for both the PC and Xbox. Seeing as this ambitious project was originally designed for release on the personal computer the extra content was certainly in order for that platform. Besides slight technical changes like texture quality both versions are exactly the same content wise. You can read the PC review here, which almost completely sums up our feelings for the game here on the Xbox Channel. The Lost Chapters is a blast, but it's not drastically different from the original game.   For anyone new to the world of Fable you should first take a good hard look at your gaming priorities, then read up on our extensive coverage on IGN Xbox. In the realm of role playing games on this console Fable does not approach the breadth of Morrowind or the depth of combat found in Jade Empire but instead takes the prize for style and giving players a lasting connection with their character. The combat interface is incredibly simple and intuitive giving the title more in common with the Zelda series than most other recent RPG epics. The quests and storyline are linear but there is a large amount of character customization and sandbox activities to rope players into the experience.    The main quest consists of a trite revenge quest with a plot most experienced RPG fans will see coming from a mile away. The real beauty of Fable exists in the small details like hanging out at a pub, showing off your trophies, and enticing your wife to hit the hay with you. This is to say that the adventure has many of the same attractive qualities as the sims, so even gamers who've searched every nook and cranny of Albion may enjoy returning for the extra content.     On that note it should mentioned that the majority of the new content can be classified as side quest material. There are a few new characters scattered about the world and some and some extra content sewn into the story but the main addition is tacked onto the game after the original ending. It includes an entirely new area, some fresh enemies, and a boss battle that was heavily discussed during development but never made it to the final Xbox game.     If you were hoping for changes to the core story then prepared to be disappointed however the game does feel more complete than the original. Because this game was fabled (heh) to be the greatest RPG of all time its devoted fans kept close tabs on content that was supposed to be included in the adventure. A good chunk of these features fell to the cutting room floor but were clearly hinted at throughout the game world. For example there were demon doors that never opened, ships that never set sale, and legends that only existed in books. The Lost Chapters will provide some closure for hardcore fans. There are also some minor tweaks that give the story a slightly better flow.    Other additions are solely for giggles like the bordello in Darkwood or the new tattoos and hats that make for goofy adornments. Our PC editor extraordinaire Steve Butts put it best when he said that the Lost Chapters are probably not a reason to play through the game again if you've already experienced the game as both a good and evil character. However, if you only played on one side of the tracks or never stepped into Albion in the first place then pick this game up right away. Otherwise, even priced as a platinum hit The Lost Chapters probably doesn't offer enough content to warrant another purchase if you already played the heck out of the first release.Fable is an incredibly fun RPG that wooed us when it first hit the shelves and should attract countless others with this update. Im glad that Lionhead Studios took the time to add the TLC to the Xbox version but Im far more excited over the possibilities of the next chapter of Fable.", "date": "Oct 24, 2005"}
