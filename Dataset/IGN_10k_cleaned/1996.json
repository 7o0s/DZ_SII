It's not because it's a bad game, although I don't think it's an exceptionally good one -- more, it's because there are some aspects of the game that I like very much, and some that I don't like one bit.  Unfortunately, when it comes to judging the game as a whole, it's the dislikes that win, spoiling the entire game.    Maximum Remix adds new frills, in fact quite a lot of them -- new levels, new music, new tricks, and new stat-tracking categories -- but it doesn't change anything about the game on a fundamental level.  As such, I look at it with the same regret.  I have high hopes for the sequel, but this upgraded version is for fans only.  Gameplay  What do I like about Dave Mirra?  The trick system, first and foremost, has a great fundamental idea behind it.  Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX nicked its trick control straight out of Tony Hawk and suffered for it, to my mind -- the number of tricks was comparatively limited, the combinations weren't as realistic, and for God's sake, Cory Nastazio couldn't do a straight tabletop.  Dave Mirra's combination of the trick and modifier buttons demands more dexterity from the player, but it's a more realistic representation of how you link freestyle tricks, and once you grasp it (especially the cancels and other complex maneuvers), there are many more different trick combinations available to every rider.  I'll never, ever be able to get past the pace and sense of speed in this game, though.  No matter how hard you pedal and how much air you grab, you never seem to get enough velocity to set up a good trick line.  The way the levels are designed, most of them being relatively cramped for space in the areas with significant trick potential (there are lots of slopes and obstacles to deal with in between spots where you can grind and get air), works with the slow speed limit to hinder development of serious momentum, which in turn makes it hard to set up and pull off combinations.  It's all well and good to find an interesting line, but there's no point to it if you don't have the speed to precisely pull it off.  The structure of ascending challenge tiers on each level adds a lot of depth to the ProQuest mode -- there are three sets of four progressively more difficult tasks, each of which unlocks something different -- but if the substance of that progression is not fun, it's a lot of work put to a questionable end.  There needed to be better control at the core of all of this.  Graphics  It's a push as far as looks are concerned.  Put Dave Mirra up against Activision's competition and each has its pros and cons -- Hoffman has better-looking stages, Mirra probably has spots of superior animation (and certainly a broader repertoire of animations), character models have their problems in either case.  Maximum Remix doesn't feature visible upgrades to the graphics engine, in any event, with lots of texture warp, choppy mip-mapping and polygon seams still evident all over most of the levels.  The most accomplished visual element, then, is the animation, both the motion-captured tricks and the loose, fluid bails, which feel a bit less canned than some -- the riders seem to be reacting to the environment a little more faithfully, a la ATV Offroad Fury.  Again, though, if the original Dave Mirra didn't impress you with its looks, the remix won't change your mind.  Sound  This also goes for the soundtrack, which unfortunately adheres to the common extreme-sports practice of licensing a fistful of sounds-the-same punk bands.  There are bright lights here and there (Pennywise, the Dropkick Murphys), and the Radical Remix omake CD is certainly appreciated, but this doesn't hold a candle to the brilliantly eclectic Tony Hawk 2 or Mat Hoffman soundtracks.  I will, however, extend a compliment to one of the particularly bright spots of the effects suite: the sound of the bike clattering to the ground is particularly faithful to reality. Of course, this review is built on a fundamental dislike of Dave Mirra's control system and all the related design issues I mentioned above (and the fact that Troy McMurray's bike STILL has a Haro sprocket, but enough of that...).  From there, all else follows, so however good or bad everything that surrounds that system is, I can't personally recommend the game.Obviously, others disagree with that fundamental dislike, considering the many positive reviews of the original version of the game and its evident financial success.  To those players, I definitely recommend this follow-up -- for something that could easily be mocked as a Radical Rehash, it's actually got a respectable complement of new levels, challenges, tricks, and other good stuff.", "date": "Jun 25, 2001"}
