It's much worse. Budget titles have their place in the videogame world, but there is almost nothing present here to warrant more than a passing glance.       The single-player campaign takes you through the conquest of Iwo Jima by placing you in historical battles. Each level is introduced through the reading of a letter while real footage that looks like it came straight from the History Channel plays next to the text. As an introduction to the upcoming stage, this works fairly well. Unfortunately, the scenes of war do nothing but give you false hope about what you're in for once the level loads.   Here's what you can learn about the conquest of Iwo Jima from playing this game. The US needed to take over an island, so they sent in three or four guys. All but one of them died in the first few seconds. This is surprising since the Japanese soldiers apparently had a penchant for firing their guns in the air randomly, ducking repeatedly, and running towards grenades to kick them even if it puts them in danger. The last super soldier went on to run through some trenches and caves, killing enemies and planting C4 in strategic places. It was a difficult battle.   The Japanese soldiers love to do squats. Each mission starts you with a KBAR, .45 Colt pistol, some form of rifle and either grenades or a rocket launcher. You can't change weapon sets during a level - what you're given to start is what you get, though one level did sport a flamethrower that could be picked up and used. Some of the rifles work better than others, but since you don't have anyone else in your squadron backing you up you'll find that you very often don't have the right gun for the job. Walking in with a short range machine gun and finding a gun turret constantly laying down suppressing fire is far from fun. Neither is the fact that none of the stationary heavy machine guns can be used by the player. It's difficult to aim most of the weapons accurately, especially at long distances which are the only safe way to do it. The enemies don't suffer this problem. Rather, their shots will register as hits seemingly at random - they can even shoot you with their gun aimed up in the sky or before they have made it entirely around a corner.   The enemy A.I. is atrocious, but that doesn't make the game easy. Since there isn't any possibility of regaining health once you've lost it, any damage you take is a real set back. With no way of obtaining intelligence aside from your sometimes-present scope and an intense fog that limits both the draw distance and your planning skills, you'll find that you are constantly being surprised by the next group of enemies. You'll probably kill them, but they'll get a shot in themselves, draining you slowly to the point of having to restart or die repeatedly. It's frustrating and requires you to play through the same stretches of a level over and over before you learn exactly where you should move to engage the next set of enemies or dodge incoming fire.    The explosions are not pretty. In an attempt to spice things up, there are three items hidden in each level for the player to find. These are a katana, a samurai helmet, and a WWII era Japanese flag. By obtaining these three souvenirs in a level, you'll be rewarded with a very brief video similar to the ones that play at the beginning of each stage. The down-side to these souvenirs is that they don't remain in your inventory if you die, even if you've reached a checkpoint. Since you can't backtrack in most of the levels to pick up the souvenir again, it means you'll have to replay the entire mission. The reward isn't worth the effort.     Further complicating the checkpoint system is the wonky mission objectives list. Occasionally when you meet an objective and then reach a checkpoint, the objective won't be saved after you die. Since you can't go back and replay that part, the game flashes a failed objective you already completed and restarts at the checkpoint. It only happened to us a few times, but having to replay a section because the game broke only serves to compound the frustration level present in Iwo Jima.   Although the gameplay is poor, the visuals and style might be worse. Iwo Jima seems to have found new shades of grey that were previously unknown. Everything from greenish-grey to hazy colors of red and brown are present in a rare abundance. Explosions, especially those from grenades, are unmoving and do little to make you feel like you're actually fighting for your life. Add to that the fact that everybody in the game looks the same and you have yourself a nice equation for boring. The animations are the epitome of bargain bin, though watching a stiff body sailing through the air after stepping on a landmine is surprisingly funny.   Your enemies will step on mines they laid out as a trap. The sound effects and music in Iwo Jima are passable, even if they're completely generic. The music ramps up in the right places to build up to a battle and the explosions sound much better than they look. The downside is that there isn't nearly enough variety. The same single sound of Japanese rifle fire can be heard throughout the game and their limited vocabulary gets increasingly tiresome as the game wears on.    To the game's credit, the multiplayer features are fairly robust. You can play online or through a LAN with up to 16 players. The Xbox version also sports 4-player split screen. Players choose one of five classes to play as, each with its own weapons set. There are options to play deathmatch, king of the hill, and last man standing either solo or with a team. There's also the classic team modes of VIP escort and capture the flag. Each of these modes can be played on 10 different maps. It's nothing you haven't seen before, or seen done better, but it's there and functional. Unfortunately, you'll be playing most of your multiplayer games against bots. At the time of this writing, we couldn't find anybody playing the Xbox version and only a small group playing on the PC.    Bargain bin games appear at the end of every hardware cycle. Just when it becomes cost effective to slap together games using old engines with little investment, you begin to see games like World War II Combat: Iwo Jima. Cutting edge games may cost more at the register, but the investment is clearly worth it when you consider this as your alternative. The graphics, gameplay and AI seem like they fell out of a time warp from too many years ago. With much better games that came out just a short while ago available at a comparable cost, there isnt a good reason to purchase Iwo Jima.", "date": "Aug 8, 2006"}
