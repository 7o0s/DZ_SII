However, Hasbro is updating the classic game for today's world in a new edition called Monopoly Here & Now, where tokens are of-the-moment (such a hybrid cars and RAZR cells) and inflation affects everything from rental fees to taxes. No more $75 income tax for you -- we're talking $150,000 now.   But even though Monopoly has received a face lift, the rules remain the same. This is classic Monopoly at its core, and even with the bang-up job Glu did with recreating the board, the animated tokens, and other trimmings, the fact remains that very little new ground is tread. For many gamers, that's not a bad thing. Monopoly purists can settle right in and enjoy a showdown with computer opponents or pass-the-phone with fellow carbon-based real estate moguls. All the ruthless tricks of bidding wars, bankruptcy, land swaps, and rent are just as potent in Here & Now, but thanks to the increased dollar amounts, nothing feels quaint any more. Auctions now head into the seven figure range regularly, and throwing around $5 million actually gives you greater pause.   I assume that many players will end up in showdowns with AI opponents instead of other people. Lemme tell you -- the computer is mean. Wicked. Evil. Even on the easy setting, the AI draws little quarter. And on hard? You better bring not only your A-game, but also every ounce of luck in your back pocket. A favorite trick of AI opponents is to lure you into a property auction, bid it up, and then pass after pushing you to the breaking point. That's good strategy, of course, but it's cruel. It's, well, Monopoly.   Monopoly Here & Now looks great. I've tested the game on a couple handsets and Glu has done a great job recreating the physical board game. The 3D effects are solid, the colors are bright, and the sound effects are good.  Like Monopoly? Then there is no reason you won't enjoy the new Here & Now edition, as it adheres to classic rules so you don't have to relearn anything -- just roll up your sleeves and ruin some lives. But if you already have Monopoly on your handset, the need to upgrade becomes a little fuzzy. Sure, this version looks great and the Here & Now cosmetic changes are fun, but the mechanics are essentially the same. You'll have to decide for yourself if you're willing to spend another $5 or so for what is arguably the best version of Monopoly -- even if it is the same Monopoly you already own at its core.", "date": "Nov 1, 2006"}
