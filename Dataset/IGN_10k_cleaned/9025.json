While the processor was fast enough, the marketing-coined term's primary goal was to get players to the Genesis in droves by any means possible. Sonic the Hedgehog games made blast processing seem like a reality by way of blistering speeds and crisp visuals, and it's hard to say that Sonic 2 was--and still may be--the best of the bunch.   Just as in the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic 2 sports some huge environments, though to an even greater degree than its predecessor. Whether blazing through Emerald Hill, Casino Zone, or the fan favorite Chemical Plant, there are dozens and dozens of areas for players to explore. What makes the level designs so spectacular is SEGA's ability to place the player on what seems to be the level's main path, and as they're barreling through, they'll constantly point to the screen in excitement and say, ~Cool! How do I get over there?~   Adding to Sonic 2's high element of exploration is the fact that Sonic is out of the player's control for rather long stretches of time, sometimes for as long as twenty seconds. Watching hitherto uncharted terrain whiz by as Sonic blasts through walls and dives through pipes never fails to attract my attention and retract my steps to search long and hard for secret passages and hidden items.    Sonic 2's levels are still memorable. Exploration is not the only factor through which Sonic 2 demonstrates its versatile gameplay. Quite simply, there's just a lot to do in this game. Players can run through each level, especially in local or online Versus games, the goal of which is to complete certain levels faster than the opponent. Players can hunt down seven Chaos Emeralds in the single-player game by touching a waypoint with 50 or more rings in their possession. The Casino Zone is a dramatic shift in gameplay, slowing things down to allow players to jump into slot machines or bounce along pads to gain as many points as possible. Each Zone's unique theme manifests itself through unique aesthetics and an assortment of gameplay mechanics, making each level different enough from the last to keep the gameplay fresh and engrossing for veterans and newcomers to Sonic lore.   Sonic 2 has a save game feature identical to Live Arcade's re-release of the original Sonic, which is great, as the ability to save at any given time will assist players in their exploration of each Zone's levels. Additionally, Sonic 2's later stages can get quite difficult, which made my use of the save feature embarrassingly prolific. Unfortunately, other than saving games and the now-expected graphical smoothing, Sonic 2 doesn't come with any other upgrades. The SEGA Vintage Collection is like a vault full of ancient relics re-opened after years of being entombed. Wouldn't it seem logical for SEGA to take a bit of time to include even a few paragraphs for each of these venerable titles? The SEGA Genesis Collection for PlayStation 2 received this kind of treatment. Why not treat Xbox 360 gamers as well, both those welcoming back Sonic as an old friend, and those who have yet to experience his addicting, speedy gameplay?   A minor fault exists in Tails, the Robin to Sonic's Batman--or, keeping in the context of videogames, the Luigi to Sonic's Mario. The artificial intelligence demonstrated by Tails during Sonic 2's single-player campaign is just that: artificial, and painfully so. Tails is always two or three steps behind Sonic, which makes his inclusion in the ~3D~ Chaos Emerald Bonus stages detrimental at best, since he's always colliding with bombs, thus causing the player to lose valuable rings.   Tails' presence in the game's regular levels won't prevent the player from finishing stages, collecting Rings, or anything of that sort, but his inclusion doesn't add anything to the experience either, making him useless outside of Versus games. Fortunately, Players can choose to play solely as Sonic--or solely as Tails--before starting a new game. This option was available in the Genesis original through the game's Options menu, which was strangely hidden from view on the main screen.   Though the Vintage Collection consists only of pure, emulated re-releases, it's inexcusable that Sonic 2's co-op doesn't exist in an online capacity. Playing with a friend on the same console is fun for whoever controls Sonic, but Tails acts only as cannon fodder to hostile projectiles. He can move ahead as far as he looks, but, given that this is an emulation of the original cartridge, the screen doesn't scroll unless Sonic moves, leaving Tails players to sit idly by as Sonic runs around, doing whatever he pleases. Would it have been so difficult to cast a bit of programming magic that fooled the game into thinking players were playing on the same machine even though, in actuality, they were playing via Xbox Live? Apparently so.  15 years after its debut and subsequent packaging with the Genesis console itself, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 holds up as not only one of the best games available on Sega's memorable 16-bit machine, but also a worthy addition to any XBLA library. A concern that exists, among both 360 and Wii gamers, is that Sega will eventually release the Sonic and Knuckles versions of the later Sonic games, which could render this version of Sonic 2, as well as the Wii Virtual Console's versions, useless. Still, Sonic 2 is only 400 Microsoft Points (US$5), making it a must-buy for any Sega fan at the current time. And by ~any Sega fan,~ what I mean is, anyone who enjoys good videogames.", "date": "Sep 12, 2007"}
