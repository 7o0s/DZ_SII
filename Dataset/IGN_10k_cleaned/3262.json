It?s a frantic four-player hack-and-slash that combines spell-casting and third-person shooting into one package. It follows in the footsteps of Gauntlet, but actually manages to bring forth a more cohesive design, even if less complicated. The High Voltage developed action title arrives on GameCube with its share of problems, however. In the process of porting it, visual and sound quality has taken a dive, which is very disappointing. Of course all the four-player madness is still great fun, but Hunter: The Reckoning is largely a communal activity, more suitable for rentals. The FactsOne to four player simultaneously, all on the same screenChoose from one of four main characters20 different types of monsters ranging from zombie-heads-turned-spider to femme fatale vampiresSeven gigantic boss charactersWealth of weaponry includes over 20 melee, ranged, and spell attacksGory and unfettered; remove limbs and watch the pieces flyDolby Pro Logic II supportNo progressive scan supportVisuals run at 60 fps; inferior to Xbox versionGameplayHunter: The Reckoning is based on White Wolf's tabletop RPG, set in the World of Darkness. The general concept is that there are demons and undead everywhere. However, humans cannot see them -- only those who have been chosen can see the world for the horror it is. The general population sees much of the undead's devastation as gang killings or animal maulings. So, four people that witnessed an imbuing, the point when a rift between the world of the undead and humans tore open, are destined to save the world; Duece, a biker ex-con, Father Cortez, a prison chaplain, Kassandra, a raver chick, and Samantha, a resilient ex-cop are all playable main characters. They each have their own attributes; Samantha wields a revolver and a sword while Father Cortez uses a crossbow and sword, relying more on his edge to deal serious damage. Edges, meanwhile, are the spells that each character can learn. They range from damaging massive groups to healing yourself. This whole system is wrapped around gaining experience, too, so everything will get stronger as you progress. It's a system like any other that requires you begin the quest with your four friends; otherwise, someone is going to be weak if they join the party late. The core gameplay is very basic. It is a hack-and-slash at heart. You face off against hordes of enemies. Zombies will continually drag themselves out of the ground, and you'll see a couple dozen of them chasing after you before too long. It's all-out, raw carnage. It's up to you if you want to hack through them with a blunt weapon or mow them down with a machine gun. To increase the variation, weapons like the machine gun, chainsaw, and shotgun are special pickups. You see, characters are equipped with a standard set of weapons that have infinite ammo (balanced by the fact that you have to reload the guns, of course). However, all around the worlds you can find more powerful weapons that have limited ammo; the chainsaw, flamethrower, and shotgun are all handy, but you'll have to earn them by exploring. Overall, the weapon selection is pretty good. Each weapon feels genuinely rewarding because of the effect it has.    As the natural progression of hack-and-slash titles go, you will battle your way into the lairs of some truly gigantic boss figures. They're nothing special in the way of AI, but a few are pretty amusing in design. Take the hulking, possessed Teddy Bear, for example. A toy that drops from the arms of Kaylie, a small girl, it brutally murders her two parents right in front of her and then comes after her. On their own, the bosses' patterns are easily learned and adapted to. It's the dynamic of trying to work with three of your friends that makes it entertaining.That is basically a mantra across the entire game, in fact. Play four-player or don't play at all. The controls work pretty well, where the C-stick is used to keep you aiming at your target, and the camera, while not perfectly ideal, gets the job done. But there's no denying that Hunter: The Reckoning is monotonous, even tedious by design -- kill tons of enemies, kill boss, rise and repeat. Only if you can gather four players into one room (preferably the more vocal kind) is it relatively amusing. As you and your friends scream for blood and show off by garnering the most kills, you'll find it is that energy that gives Hunter: The Reckoning life. This makes Interplay's frantic action-shooter best suited for a weekend rental, at a time when you can plan to have some friends around. It is not remotely suited to be played alone. GraphicsDespite the fact that High Voltage was the original developer behind Hunter, its port to GameCube has not been a smooth one. All the flash of the Xbox version -- lighting, texture work, and effects -- has been dumbed down. It runs at 60 frames per second in single-player, and holds up moderately with many creatures filling the screen at once, but with four players participating in the action the framerate takes a hit. Texture resolution, especially, has really gone downhill. Barring the reasonably detailed character models, the worlds around you are a blurry mess. Thankfully the camera is best set at a distance from it.   No progressive scan or widescreen support. SoundWe have to give the developer credit for including Dolby Pro Logic II support. If you're a surround aficionado, you're going to get a better experience for sure if you have the right equipment. That positive, however, is offset by a negative: quality. The numerous voice samples and sound effects are now more tinny and distorted. It's a real shame, as many GameCube titles have proven there is no hardware-related limitation to doing good sound.In sum, the audio experience is pretty commonplace, featuring voice-acted cut-scenes and varied sound effects. When Hunter released on Xbox, it received some pretty high marks. Perhaps it was because it delivered on what Gauntlet didn't, or maybe it was just the visual execution and gory style. Indeed, gathering four people into one room and taking out all your aggression with all these death-dealing weapons is entertaining. However, for me, there was simply no shaking the sensation of repetition. No matter how you spin it, you are doing the same thing over and over with little variation. The controls work pretty well and you eventually succumb to the idea that the camera will never show you exactly what you want to look at, but the biggest enjoyment I had was just socializing with my friends over this gore fest. It's totally mindless. Nothing more.Considering those issues, Hunter: The Reckoning is more of a rent-worthy title than anything else. It's not particularly long, and something you could burn through in a weekend's time. Recommended for that, absolutely.A nice addition to GameCube's multiplayer lineup.", "date": "Nov 25, 2002"}
