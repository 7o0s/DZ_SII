Closer to real life than Namco's Ridge Racer series, yet with the emphasis firmly placed on 'fun' The Need For Speed managed to garner a large following of dedicated fans.  However, the sequel doesn't live up to the high expectations set by the first.  Like the first, Need For Speed II's strength lies in its variety of actual high-performance cars. You're offered a McLaren F1 or Ferrari F50, or any of six other 'concept' cars that you probably have never even seen before (except in 'Expensive Concept Cars' magazine). The cars handle as they would in real life (we're guessing, we haven't actually driven any of these babies) and can be driven with an automatic or manual transmission.   Turning is perhaps the least realistic aspect of the control, with jerky steps replacing any semblance of smooth turning, although this may be down to the D-pad more than anything else. The variety of tracks is also quite nice, running the gamut from Australia's outback to the Pacific North West.  Where Need For Speed II really fails is the graphics. The detail on everything is very poor - especially the much-hyped cars where it should be the sharpest. Comparing it to  Namco's Rage Racer is like putting a piece of costume jewelry up against the real thing. Add to that the place holder-looking backgrounds, and the choppy frame-rate, and Need For Speed II really falls behind.  Need For Speed II could have been a decent racing game. All the right elements are there - cool cars, inventive tracks, decent control -  but the execution has been seriously flawed by poor graphics and frame rate.", "date": "Apr 4, 1997"}
