Developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, the game tells the tale of one very deceased knight's quest to rid the land of undead legions and the wicked magician that created them. Players assume the role of Sir Dan, deceased knight in question. His mission: make it across the land of Gallowmere and defeat the vile Zarok. Running, jumping, and slashing all the way.  Sir Dan has several weapons (including throwing daggers, clubs, and axes) at his disposal, and also has an inventory to hold special items  such as door-unlocking runes  to aid in his adventure. There are also several additional items he'll find along the way: information gargoyles (they dispense helpful information, oddly enough), merchant gargoyles (enchant weapons and buy goods), treasure chests (more moola!), and the Chalice of Souls (only the best players will collect them all).  Gameplay-wise it's very reminiscent of the action-platformers of old, consisting largely of running around each stage whilst hacking up baddies. But there are also a good share of puzzles to be solved.Ghosts & Goblins, is that you? Not quite. But MediEvil does adopt enough of this classic action-platformer's style that you'd expect the copyright cops to be knocking at Sony's door.Homage aside, it's still a good (but not great) game on its own merits. If you're looking for innovation, look elsewhere, but if a mindless hack-'n-slash romp is what you're after, this will fit the bill nicely. Sir Arthur reacts promptly to your commands, the environments are clever, and there's plenty of personality to go around. But on the down side, it's simply nothing that a 16- or 8-bit game could have delivered aside from the lavish graphics.Fans of this kind of game will definitely want to give it a play. Anyone expecting an innovative, next-generation experience will be left out in the cold.", "date": "Oct 23, 1998"}
