One of the sweetest blasts from the past has arrived, courtesy of Hudson. It's the classic TurboGrafx-16 strategy game, Military Madness, and it is just as freaking awesome today as it was in 1989.   Military Madness casts you as the commander of a sci-fi army comprised of aerial units, ground troops, and vehicles. You must square off against a rival army for control of the moon in a series of turn-based battle across the stark real estate of La Luna. Sometimes you're on pure offensive, other times you must hold back and defend your lunar turf. But at no point is there a shortage of battles, which will keep you jacked into the game for a long, long time.   When you start the game, you must move your units around the environment, which consists of various terrains like rough ground, paved rounds, mountains. Terrain has a direct effect on your battle. If you have the higher ground, for example, you're attack power increases. Once you move units within fighting range, you can attack and watch a small battle play out. The more battles your units enter (and survive) the more experience they gain. Advanced units have more attack power, making it easy for them to crush noob units.   The game starts off easy, letting you get accustomed to your command duties. However, the difficulty ratchets up soon enough and you cannot rely on frontal assaults. You must seek high ground, plan ambushes, and attempt to shut down enemy bases. If you got into Nintendo's Advance Wars GBA franchise, you'll love Military Madness.   Flying Tiger did a remarkable job porting the TG-16 game to handsets. The game really does look like the classic, only slightly scaled down for the smaller screen. But even better than the appropriate visuals, though, is the soundtrack. The classic tunes are back and they sound fantastic even coming out of a handset. There are a few tracks for different occasions, such as your turn, the enemy's turn, when the tide is truly in your favor, etc. When it comes time for a battle screen, the game goes quiet to concentrate on some pretty ho-hum fighting noises.Military Madness was an astounding game all those years ago -- and it has aged better than any other Turbo game I can think of. (Well, that Bonk remake on the GameCube was pretty good.) The game is a natural fit for your cellphone, providing nicely episodic play sessions and a handy save feature if you need to cut a battle short to pay attention to somebody's useless blathering. Hudson and Flying Tiger really nailed this port -- I will continue to play it long after posting this review. In fact, I may even bust out my Turbo this weekend, too. Military Madness is just that good.", "date": "Apr 21, 2005"}
