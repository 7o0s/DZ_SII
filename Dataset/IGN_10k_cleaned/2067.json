Not your normal credit roll call of programmers, artists, and testers, the credits play in between odd FMV sequences.  The FMV sequences show a costumed alligator (or crocodile if you like) chasing a costumed rabbit (or hare if you like) and a costumed chipmunk (or groundhog, squirrel, or rat).  Anyways, the rabbit and chipmunk meet a costumed gorilla who sells them Razor Scooters so it's easier to run from their reptilian enemy.  Thus done, they easily escape the clutches of our evil alligator, even taunting him by continually circling him.  Of course, not to be outdone, our reptile meets up with the scooter selling gorilla, and buys one himself.  Thinking that he's rich, we see our gorilla strutting his money walk, only to be finally chased by all three scooter riding costumed animals.  My point?  If you're like me, you'll be probably more entertained by this eccentric movie than playing Razor Freestyle Scooter.  That's not to say that Razor Freestyle Scooter is a crapful of wretched wackness.  It's certainly better than many substandard Dreamcast games.  You see, the problem lies in the fact that we are in the final months of the Dreamcast.  We've seen gorgeous titles like Shenmue and have experienced excellent gameplay ranging from Jet Grind Radio to Phantasy Star Online.  Now I don't mind it that Crave decides to port over a PlayStation game to the Dreamcast.  Unfortunately, it's Razor Freestyle Scooter that didn't score too well on the PlayStation and while the Dreamcast version displays some very enhanced visuals, we all know gameplay is the meat of a title.  Razor is nothing more than the same type of meatloaf served over again, just twice over cooked.  The game is obviously aimed at the younger genre of kids and that's readily apparent with the story.  It's just a normal day at the scooter park when a mysterious robot kidnaps your friends.  If you want to get them back, you'll have to complete each of the robot's park challenges.  The challenges are to scooter through the park, doing tricks as you like, and collect all the scooter wheels scattered throughout the level.  Sounds familiar?  It should... we've been doing since Tony Hawk.  If there's a definite strength of Razor, it's the visuals.  Now, we're definitely not talking about Shenmue or Skies Of Arcadia caliber, but the game certainly looks a helluva lot better than its PS version.  Very clean graphics and a super smoothg 60 fps frame rate totally took me off guard and it's nice to see a translation of a game get the full Dreamcast facelift.  Still, it's not like this game is super graphic intensive; textures are pretty simple, and while there are some nice colors, there's not like a whole variety of different colors in throughout the level.  While the game runs at 60 fps, you don't get a real sense of speed in this game.  Yeah, I know you're on a scooter, but when you went down a ramp Tony Hawk, you felt like you were going pretty fast.  Not the case here and sometimes it looks like you're ~floating~ rather than actually riding.  While it tries the same gameplay mechanics of the great Tony Hawk and succeeds somewhat, the game does nothing new at all.  The trick system isn't too complex and while it's not a complete rip of Tony Hawk or Grind Session, there's nothing really inventive.  Sure, because you're on a scooter, you have all sorts of new tricks that only apply to a scooter.  You have your grinds (with balance meter), your holds, your spins, and hand plants but it's certainly nothing we haven't seen.  The level design is okay with some really crazy locales for scooter parks in the later levels.  Still, a quick once around will reveal that there's nothing really new here that we haven't seen before.  Controls are okay, slightly floaty, but not bad.  I had some issues when doing spin moves; since you really don't get any real speed when going down ramps, you really can't get some crazy spin moves.  Lastly, the sound are a bit of a mix.  Sound effects range from average to poor; call me picky, but it's somewhat annoying when a character makes the same ~bailing~ sound every time he or she messes up a trick.  The music is pretty good with some bands I've never heard before performing good alternative tracks.  Oh, I forgot to mention that there's one last part of the FMV credit sequence where the costumed rabbit goes to get his haircut (while reading an issue of Giant Robot even).  Though strangely entertaining, it seems kind of out of place in a video game.  That's also the case for Razor Freestyle Scooter.  Coming out near the end of the Dreamcast after Tony Hawk and Dave Mirra have already made their mark, the game doesn't offer anything new to the genre and definitely doesn't offer anything - other than a comedic FMV sequence - Dreamcast gamers haven't seen... and better, for that matter.  Like the humors credit screen I described earlier, it's kind of humorous at first, but it doesn't make any sense.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC Heck with this.  If you haven't got Tony Hawk 2, buy Tony Hawk 2.  If you've already got Tony Hawk 2, play it some more.  Same damn thing, heck of a lot more fun.  Acclaim's Dave Mirra I'm willing to offer some respect to because its trick system employs some original mechanics - Razor, to strip the statement of unkind embellishment, does not.  It doesn't do anything new with its variation on the trickster's mount, if indeed there's any such thing that could be done with these thrice-condemned yuppoid doomed-once-February-rolls-around widgets.So buy Tony Hawk.  And while I'm at it, if for some reason you feel moved to buy yourself or someone else a Razor, blow the extra money on an honest-to-God skateboard.  You'll thank yourself in the spring, trust me.", "date": "Aug 17, 2001"}
