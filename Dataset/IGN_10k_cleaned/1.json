More than I'd like to bother with. Defcon 5 certainly fits into this category, but with one little difference - it's actually pretty good.  Defcon 5 puts you on a space station, with the job of quelling an imminent invasion. Sure, it's a pretty standard premise, but it gets better. The real excitement lies not so much in mindless shooting, although there is enough of that to satisfy most action-lovers, but in the development of plot and suspense.   What really pushes this title beyond the shooter mindset are the little things, those minute details that add believability to a game and help you achieve immersion in the game's world. Things like the way killing enemies has an adverse effect on the air quality in whatever room you're in, or the way the invasion evolves slowly over time. All of this contributes to a pretty complex strategy. Worth checking out.", "date": "Nov 21, 1996"}
