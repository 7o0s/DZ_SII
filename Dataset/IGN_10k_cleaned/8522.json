Snoop Dogg Cruisin' chronicles the rise of a young buck in the hood, seeking fame with his ultra-pimped whip. As you -- playing the part of said buck -- follow Snoop's lead and makes that money, you buy new hydraulics, rims, grill, and booming speakaz for your car. The ultimate goal is to be the playa amongst playaz in the hood, besting all chumps that try to roll with you in Compton, Venice, and Long Beach. Think you have the thumbs to pop and bounce with the best?   Cruisin' is actually a pretty simple little mobile game -- it's mainly a game of one-thumb timing -- so much of the game's appeal rests squarely on how interested you are in the low rider scene and getting encouragement from a digital Snoop. Sony really did a solid job making the game look like an itty-bitty rap video, as tiny rides cruise down a Comptown street lined with young hustlers or bounce in front of the beaches of Venice. The only catch is that it's hard to really enjoy the animations of the bouncing cars or the other hydraulic antics because your eyes are so glued to timing meters. You may want to see your '68 Impizzle (one of the three cars in the game) bounce nine feet in the air, but if you take your peepers off the bounce meter, you'll invariably lose your groove.   There are three events in each city: Height, Snoop Says, Cruise, and Freestylin'. In the hydraulic Height event, you must bounce your car as high as possible by hitting OK when the mark on a meter hits the green zone. In the simin-says section, you push the directional pad along with the arrows that scroll along the bottom of the screen. Each direction makes your car jump, tilt, and ground. In the freestyle events, you make up your own combos, but you have to link moves that keep the car in motion. You cannot just keep pressing up, for example. You have to craft a series of smooth tilts and pops to entertain the crowds on the boulevard, so you can drop the car, then pop it on its left side, right it and then raise it to string a combo.   With the money you earn from practicing and entering competition events, you can buy the abovementioned upgrades for your whip. You can raise your fame a little by picking out new rims, but you must keep on top of new hydraulic kits if you want to survive the tougher trials in Venice and LBC. You can also buy the other cars after earning enough cash and then pimp them out. If you really sat down and wanted to push through all of the cities and earn all of the upgrades, you could linger with Cruisin' for a good hour or so.   The game may be shallow, but it's actually pretty amusing while it lasts. My beef is that I unlocked all three cities and was throwing my whip over nine feet into the air within about twenty minutes. After slapping some gold grills and spinnaz on the car, I realized there really wasn't much else going on in Cruisin'. And that's when my interest really waned.  Snoop Dogg Crusin' knows its audience -- and I think people into hip-hop and Pimp My Ride will enjoy the game. But there's a major question of longevity here, and I believe Cruisin' runs on fumes sooner than acceptable for a six dollar download.", "date": "May 23, 2007"}
