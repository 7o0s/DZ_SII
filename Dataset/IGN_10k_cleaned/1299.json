That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.    How long has it been since your ears stopped registering how silly it sounds to call a game ~MOO~?  For instance, can you say ~MOO was a revolution in turn based strategy~ and keep a straight face?  Did it ever occur to you that the term ~4X~ might look like a label for ultra-hardcore porno beyond the mere XXX variety?  When someone says the word ~SIGH-lon,~ do you think of the shiny robot guys in Battlestar Galactica or the bulbous-headed super-intelligent aliens?  These are the kinds of questions you must ask yourself to determine if you're a Master of Orion groupie like me.  Known affectionately as MOO, this is a fondly remembered ~4X~ game, the term for empire-building strategy games that play through the four ~ex-~ phases: exploration, expansion, exploitation, and extermination.  There's an embarrassment of riches coming up for us fans of sci-fi 4X games.  SSG's remake of their 1983 classic, Reach for the Stars, was just released.  Malfador Machinations' next installment in their Space Empires series is due out at the end of this month.  And Crisium's upcoming Stars! Supernova Genesis looks like a dramatic leap from their last installment of the game they've been refining through successive releases since 1995.  It's a good time to conquer galaxies.  But the real competition for these new titles isn't necessarily each other.  It is, instead, a towering monolith in the genre that has cast an eight-year-long shadow over everything that's followed.  After spending the last three weeks revisiting it, I've found this is a monolith that still stands tall.  Master of Orion is still the definitive name in space opera games.  Although there may be some good games on the way, I'll be surprised if any of them can unseat MOO's title as king of the universe.  The two Master of Orion games were created by SimTex, a developer second only to the team of Sid Meier and Brian Reynolds when it comes to strategy gaming.  SimTex was a group of guys in Austin who burst onto the scene in 1993 with a game called Master of Orion, published by Microprose.  Their second game was a port of an Avalon Hill board game called 1830, an abstract railroad game set in the era of robber barons.  Their port was published by Avalon Hill themselves and it features the single best representation of a stock market in any computer game and a heart-breakingly good AI.  Next came Master of Magic, a 4X fantasy game published by Microprose.  Shortly after its release, Microprose acquired SimTex and set them up as an internal developer.  The ensuing Master of Orion II was technically an in-house Microprose production, although a SimTex logo briefly flashes before the Microprose name appears.  After MOO2, SimTex had a great fall: Microprose abruptly shut them down in 1998.  Whether the group's demise was a corporate tragedy or a result of their own hubris isn't clear.    On one hand, Microprose was a company in turmoil, plagued by financial trouble and internal chaos that continued until Hasbro purchased them.  Perhaps SimTex was one of the casualties of this period, a time when Microprose also lost Sid Meier and cut loose their top-notch sim developers in Maryland.  But the official story from Microprose is that SimTex wasn't making satisfactory progress on their next project, a superhero game along the lines of X-Com called Agents of Justice.  This was SimTex's second troubled project; they had developed a mech game called Mechlords that was allegedly shut down by FASA lawyers brandishing copyright infringement threats based on their MechWarrior properties.  But it's not entirely implausible that Agents of Justice could have been an ambitious unfocused mess and Microprose wisely decided to cut their loses.  There's no denying that SimTex's games got progressively more and more complex: compare the streamlined Master of Orion and elegant 1830 to the bug-plagued sprawl of Master of Magic and MOO2.  SimTex seemed prone to ~feature creep,~ the affliction whereby more and more cool things get put into a game until it bursts at the seams.    It's likely the truth is a combination of Microprose's internal turmoil and SimTex's over-ambition.  At any rate, SimTex's MOO games loom large whenever you talk about sci-fi strategy.  And as SimTex's first and last games, they're also a fascinating look at the evolution of a developer.  Some players still swear by the first Master of Orion.  While it's a more streamlined than MOO2, it's also less engaging.  A lot of MOO2's personality is missing from MOO1, which feels somehow underdone once you've spent time with its sequel.  To be sure, MOO1 plays quicker and smoother.  The way you set slider bars for research and each colony's production makes it easy to cruise through several turns without having to constantly fiddle with things.  This fiddling is mandatory in MOO2, which is much closer in playing style to Civilization, in which each colony requires a building queue and the occasional citizen-shuffling session.  MOO1, for better or worse, has none of this -- you are more overlord than administrator.  MOO2 has been widely criticized for requiring too much micromanagement, but I didn't find this any worse than most other strategy games.  When playing, you'll hit a definite MOO2 groove: you get things queued and your empire is synced up and ready to barrel ahead -- you pop off three or four turns, adjust something quickly, pop off a few more turns, rearrange your food production, vector a few new ships to a marshalling point, and cruise through several more turns.  For a turn-based game, MOO2 is snappy and easy to manage.  It's a rare combination of detail and a manageable interface.  Very few turn-based empire building games since then have managed to match this pace (the Imperialism games with their centralized production come to mind).  I haven't seen SSG's recent Reach for the Stars remake, but they seem to be trying to accomplish something similar.  When it comes to graphics, MOO2 is just fine, but MOO1 is like sandpaper on the eyeballs.  The look of the game doesn't hold up well by today's standards, not only because of the coarse resolution and primitive artwork, but also because of the limited screen real estate.  The map is cramped and there's very little of the aesthetic elegance that SimTex skillfully threaded into MOO2.  It's also harder to sink into MOO1 because it's missing the sequel's atmosphere and configurability.  Not to mention all those wonderful toys you can put on a spaceship.  With the exception of Firaxis' Alpha Centauri (which owes more to Civ than these space opera games), no science fiction game has come close to the amount of atmosphere in Master of Orion II.  A lot of this has to do with how vividly the different races are drawn.  The rich diplomatic interaction is a facet of MOO2 lifted directly from the Civ games (and later perfected in Alpha Centauri).  Races have unique graphics for their colonists, their ambassadors, their science advisors, and their ships.  But most of the atmosphere comes from the way the different races subvert the game's mechanics.  This is a common theme in space opera games, but in other games, it often feels like a matter of mere mathematics: +20% population growth, ships move at +1, and so on.  But MOO2 breathes life into Bulrathi bullying, Darlok spying, Elerian insight, and Klackon efficiency.  MOO2 ranks up there with Starcraft as one of those rare games that plays differently depending of which side you choose.    But this is partly MOO2's undoing.  There's not much balance to the races in MOO2.  Diplomatic advantages are invaluable since the computer players can be fairly easily assuaged until you're powerful enough to pound them.  Traits like Creative and Subterranean give races like the Psilons and Silicoids an incredible advantage, particularly when played by humans; they're generally banished from multiplayer games.  I still can't imagine what SimTex was thinking when they came up with the Creative trait, which effectively triples your technological advantage over the other races.  To MOO2's credit, there is a flexible custom race creator that allows for DIY play balancing.  There are other elements that make MOO2 as alive as any space opera novel or Star Trek spin off.  The leaders are an absolutely brilliant touch -- personalities emerge from the epic sprawl and you can plug them into ships or colonies for their special bonuses.  There are monsters guarding rich planets (including the notorious Guardian of Orion himself) who are more than just obstacles -- they are creatures keeping choice morsels out of your reach until later in the game, when the various empires can fight with advanced toys over newly liberated Eden's.  It adds the flavor of Old World powers fighting over lush New Worlds once there's no more elbow room at home.  And then there are the spoilers: the powerful Antareans are like dei ex machina lowered onto the scene to smack around whichever empire is in the lead.    Finally, there is the way MOO2 lets you build wonderful new toys and then play with them in the galactic arena.  Throughout the game, you'll unlock new gadgets to fit onto your ships: shields, computers, missiles, beam weapons, fighter bays, and so on.  There's a wonderfully detailed ship-building screen that appealed to the techie gearhead in us all.  This aspect of MOO2 actually reminded me of an old Steve Jackson pen-and-paper game called Car Wars, in which you designed armed cars and then pitted them against your friends' designs (Activision's I-76 and I-82 are pale shadows of Car Wars). MOO2's detailed tactical combats were a wonderful opportunity to see your designs in action.  Unfortunately, the AI in the tactical combats was predictable and weak.  In fact, the AI overall is pretty weak.  Unless you give the computer-controlled empires a production advantage by playing the game on one of the harder skill levels, it's hard to lose MOO2.  The game has stable multiplayer support, but you'll be hard-pressed to find many online games, much less players willing to see a lengthy game through to the end.  If you're lucky enough to have a LAN, MOO2 is an excellent evening's multiplayer activity for dedicated strategy gamers.  Copy the contents of the CD directly onto your hard drive to run the game on multiple computers without the CD in the drive.  Then download and install the version 1.31 patch [ftp://ftp.microprose.com/pub/mps-online/new-versions/moo2v131.zip] and kiss about ten hours good-bye.   Fortunately, the series isn't dead.  Microprose has contracted Quicksilver to develop Master of Orion III under the direction of Alan Emrich, who had a hand in both of the previous MOOs as a consultant and writer of the strategy guides.  As for the former heads of SimTex, Steve Barcia and Ken Burd, they're still making games.  Burd is currently working on Kinesoft's Magelords, which looks to be the spiritual heir to Master of Magic.  As for Barcia, well, he's gone to the dark side: he's working at Retro Studios, a group partnered with Nintendo and currently working on Game Cube titles.  Not surprisingly, Nintendo won't comment on the prospect of a MOO-like title when the Game Cube debuts.  --Tom Chick Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Presentation  A classic example of a lot of detail made easier by a good interface.   8.0  Graphics  Arguably better than many newer turn-based strategy games.    6.0  Sound  Not much actual sound, but a gently pulsing Eno-esque soundtrack.   4.0  Gameplay  Dumb and unbalanced, but also ambitious, atmospheric, and epic.   6.5  Lasting Appeal  Excellent LAN fare for hardcore strategy gamers.   8.0  Should I Go Back and Play It?  Space opera at its finest.  YES  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   8.0 Master of Orion II is arguably better than many newer turn-based strategy games.", "date": "Oct 2, 2000"}
