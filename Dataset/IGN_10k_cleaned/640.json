In those six months we got games such as Resident Evil 2, Final Fantasy Tactics, Tekken 3, Einhander, Hot Shots Golf, and Gran Turismo. Right in the middle of that summer a quirky platformer called Tomba! was released.    Tomba! took elements from all sorts of games, but still remained original. The core gameplay was objective-based where you would find a problem, then you would have to locate the correct items (or do something similar) to complete it. There also were small hints of Zelda (or Super Metroid/Castlevania Symphony of the Night) influences, as many areas which couldn't be opened initially were available after performing certain tasks.   In a time where the PlayStation is plagued by yearly rehashes, Whoopee Camp has brought back everyone's favorite... er, caveboy... in a sequel that improves upon the original in almost every way. And yes, he still has an unhealthy attraction to pigs.   Gameplay  Tomba! 2 takes everything that was great about the first game, makes it better, and then throws in even more new features. This game is exactly how you would want to see a sequel done. Sure, Whoopee Camp could have taken the ~Tomb Raider~ way out and just made a new version of the first game with new levels, but instead a whole new game was created from the ground up.   First, the game has a full polygonal environment with polygonal characters where the original had 2D characters on top of a 3D environment.  While you could move into the background in the first game, it is even a larger part of the gameplay this time around. Tomba! 2 provides a curious blend of 2D/3D movement and perspective that isn't quite Super Mario 64, nor is it strictly 2D.   When you have the opportunity to move into 3D, floating arrows will appear above Tomba's head. The arrow tells when you can access a deeper part of the background.  Later in the game there will be areas where layers upon layers of backgrounds can be explored. While it isn't true 3D movement all the time, it still gives a much better sense of depth than the fist game did. Speaking of true 3D movement, there is some of that in the game. A couple areas enable you to explore it in a top-down view where you are able to run around freely.   Some may feel that full 3D movement throughout the game would have made the game even better. I disagree. One of the charms of Tomba is that it captures the classic gameplay of 16-bit titles, and throws it into the modern day of 32/64/128-bit gaming. If the game were free roaming, it would not be Tomba. It'd just be a 3D platformer that happens to feature the character of Tomba. Part of creating a sequel is coming up with new ideas, while the other part is keeping it true to the original, and Tomba! 2 does that well.   Thankfully, the gameplay that made the first Tomba! so much fun has not been tampered with in a bad way. On the contrary, it's even better. As in the original, there are specific objectives that you need to complete, and in exchange you get AP (Adventure Points). These points can be used to unlock specific boxes around the world. Also, there are simply so many quests and side quests that the game will keep you busy for quite a while.   Some new features add to the gameplay. A good example is the Flying Squirrel suit that enables you to glide safely to certain areas. You get the suit in the snowy area, but you can backtrack and use it in earlier levels to reach objects that you previously could not.   Backtracking through the levels was one of the complaints some had about the original game. This time you can find magic feathers throughout the levels that instantly transport you to any area that you have previously visited. There are plenty of these feathers scattered throughout all the levels, so you will always have a way back and forth to the different areas and objectives.   If there was one complaint about the gameplay this time around it's that some of the objectives (and mini-games such as the mine cart level) can be frustrating and difficult. That's being subtle. Thankfully, the hardest of these are not required to complete the game.   Unfortunately, the way Tomba attacks things (he, well, jumps on their back giving a very suggestive image), may be a little strange to some. That may be why the first game became nothing more than a niche title. Unfortunately, if the wackiness of the first game turned you off, this one will be about the same.   Graphics Comparing Tomba! 2, graphically, to the original is like comparing a 16-bit game to its 32-bit sequel.  The 3D overhaul to the game makes it look very different from the original. Not only is Tomba larger in size, each background has much more depth than before. Add to that the insanely vast color palette and lighting effects that take advantage of the hardware and you have a very good-looking platformer.  Sound Probably the biggest addition to the sound portion of Tomba! 2 is the use of voice actors for every single character (except Tomba-- he just chirps like a monkey).  Every character you speak to talks back, and the voice acting isn't too bad. It's not Resident Evil (1) bad, but it still can't touch Metal Gear Solid. The one thing that tarnishes the sound is the music. While the majority of it is passable, the same monotonous music that plays during all conversations will get annoying by the second time you have to suffer through it. In the end, Tomba! 2 turns out to be a very satisfying game. It's deep, it looks great, and it added so much to what the original started.  If that's not enough for you, there is still nothing more amusing that seeing what Tomba does to those poor little pigs.", "date": "Jan 19, 2000"}
