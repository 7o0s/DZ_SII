Sure, there's Tetris Worlds and Egg Mania, but Tetris is getting a little old and Egg Mania leaves a bit to be desired.  Now Jaleco has released Super Bubble Pop, a puzzler that has you, well, popping bubbles.  Does this game fill the puzzle genre void and leave us puzzle fanatics feeling full and satisfied?  Not even in the slightest.  Features  Choose from up to 5 different DJ Poppers, each with a special power-up and  outrageous moves. Training, Chilled, Groovin' and HardCore difficulty set. Each platform has its own unique set of 4 soundtracks. Use up to 9 different Special Attacks to keep those bubbles back. The Jukebox allows you to select the order you want to listen to all music  tracks. Use of custom soundtracks. Multiple bubble skins and background effects. 2 player head-to-head matches  Gameplay Upon first hearing the name Super Bubble Pop, I expected something similar to Bust-A-Move, or something like it.  Well, in Super Bubble Pop you are trying to line up three like-colored bubbles to have them pop, but the execution is much different than in the classic Taito game.  In front of your character is a 9x9 grid that you can shoot bubbles down.  The field has some randomly placed bubbles of assorted colors that will slowly inch their way towards you.  If they make it all the way to your end, the game is over.   Having three lined up horizontally or vertically will cause them to pop, with the ultimate goal being to clear the game field.  But even a concept this rudimentary is thoroughly beaten to a pulp and left for dead in a cold dark alley.  What's the problem?  Where do I start is the real question.  3X crazy dawg!  First of all, lining up three bubbles horizontally is a feature that seems to been more of an afterthought than a basic game feature.  Let's look at an example to help illustrate this point.  Say you have two red bubbles next to each other against the far end of the playing field.  Shooting another red bubble next to either one will cause all three to pop.  No problem there.  But let's say that you have two red bubbles next to each other in the next to last line of the grid, with nothing next to either bubble.  Shooting a like-colored bubble to either side will cause the bubble to pass both red bubbles and hit the far wall.  Ok, so now you should be able to shoot another red bubble down the same path so that it will line up with the two sitting next to each other, right?  Wrong.  If you shoot another bubble down the same path, it will slide under the one on the back wall.  Shoot another ball and it will do the same.  This game property makes it horrifically difficult to line up three balls horizontally.  The only real time you can do this is when the bubbles are lined up against the far end, and that's not good.  You could also shoot six bubbles down the same path so that they stack up on top of each other.  Because six is the limit of vertically stacked bubbles, the seventh will finally rest on the line ahead, making horizontal pops possible.  It's just too bad that this is counter-intuitive with regards to the purpose of the game -- to clear the field, not build it up.  Yuck.    Also, with horizontal pops being more or less out of the question, you are left mainly with vertical pops.  This makes the majority of your gaming experience looking at the color bubble you have, finding a path with the same colored bubble, and shooting it down towards it.  Repeat again, again, and again.  No strategy, no skill, no fun.  It's actually a lot like George Jetson's job at Spacely Sprockets.  Push the shoot button, move the stick (maybe), push the shoot button, etc.  I can't imagine that this would any fun for anyone, unless they were attempting to learn the different colors of the rainbow.  Even then I could only assume that they would have more fun and be better educated with a pack of Skittles.        Alright, so the game's got a few extra features that attempt to make the game more interesting, but do they really help make the game more enjoyable?  I think not.  You have special moves that you can perform such as flipping columns of bubbles, or color swapping, but there's rarely a time that you need to, or want to use these.  Also, each one of the five ~DJs~ has a super move that will clear the entire playing field.  For example, the monkey Zim's super move is called Warp Tunnel.  Use this and the playing field will turn into a vortex and suck up all the bubbles like Mega-Maid on steroids.  Or you can use Blu's super move, cleverly titled Shrink Wrap (though I think it should've been called Shrink Rap).  Use it and a giant sheet of clear cellophane will drop from the sky and pop all the bubbles.  Exciting, I know.  You can also pick up level tokens and extra time, but the game never really changes or becomes interesting.    Graphics Super Bubble Pop is definitely not easy on the eyes.  Characters models are PS1 quality (maybe), and the game is overridden with obnoxious lighting effects and horribly animated everything.  And the color schemes are out of control.  Rather than having a coherent feel, or even different themes, the game's visuals remind me more a tech demo...by an amateur programmer who just learned how to Gouraud shade a polygon.  Everything is too excessive and busy, and it feels like effects were thrown in just for the sake of having special effects.  Bad move.  This game would have been better served by a more simplistic art style, rather such a gaudy one.  Flash for the sake of flash is never a good idea.  Functionality should be most important, but in the case of Super Bubble Pop, it is not.  Maybe next time.  Swirls and swirls of colors Sound You'd think a game with a bunch of DJs would have some decent music.  Instead, what we have here is some of the worst ~dance~ music ever -- generic, irritating, and just plain bad.  Rather than listening to the music, I suggest you go into the Jukebox and read the song names -- it is a much more enjoyable experience.  Who could not love song titles like ~Bubble Builder Shanty~ or ~Journey to Planet DJ~ or, my favorite, ~Perfect Special Moment.~  What sound effects there are don't fare any better and should be turned off when possible. Super Bubble Pop is not the poor man's puzzle game; it's the ~Not only am I broke, I'm in major debt~ man's puzzle game.  This game is not worth the price of purchase, and if you get if for free, sell it.  If you're really hurting for a puzzler on Xbox, play Tetris.  Otherwise, wait for something, anything else (hopefully a Puyo Puyo-based game, or an online Chu Chu Rocket).  A complete bust.", "date": "Jan 7, 2003"}
