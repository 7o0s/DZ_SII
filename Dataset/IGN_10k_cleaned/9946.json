All that mattered was good gameplay and a solid story (and sometimes even that was a rarity). Boy, have things changed.   Nowadays, RPGs are doused with fancy CGI effects, convoluted storylines and breath-taking music, all to look and feel more impressive. This isn't a bad thing, but it has meant the demise of smaller, simpler RPGs that don't have the budget for knock-your-socks-off FMV sequences. Luckily a few role-playing series have managed to stay above water, including Gust's line of Atelier games. Since its arrival on Western shores a few years ago, the series has gained a quiet but enthusiastic following. That's probably why NIS decided to release the next title, Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny. Does the game deliver? We're happy to say yes, but it's not flawless by any means.   Atelier Iris 2 starts off in the land of Eden where human alchemists and magical creatures called Mana live side-by-side. When an earthquake causes a part of Eden to disappear, two novice alchemists named Felt and Viese take it upon themselves to save their home. Armed with nothing more than a sense of adventure and a smart-mouthed sword called The Azure Azoth, Felt travels to the mysterious continent of Belkhyde in order to find a way to restore Eden. Meanwhile Viese stays behind to do some investigating of her own and to continue her studies as an alchemist. As the game progresses, the two learn the truth about the relationship between Belkhyde and Eden, why the Azure Azoth is more than just a talking sword, and why alchemy may be the key to saving the world...or destroying it.   I am woman. Hear me roar. The story is pretty standard RPG fare, but it still manages to be entertaining. Some of Felt's party consists of some real odd-ball characters, and towards the end you'll be treated to a couple of interesting plot-twists. Unfortunately, the pacing of the first half of the tale is ridiculously sluggish, thanks to a string of tedious fetch-quests. The developers break up some of this boredom with the ~duel scenario system,~ which allows you to switch between the two main characters at any point throughout the game. However, it's still frustrating to go searching for items in the desert and return triumphant to base only to learn you have to go find six more items.   For the majority of the game the story's progression lies with Felt, as does the action (there are no enemies in Eden for Viese to fight). This is where Atelier Iris 2 really shines, because instead of being completely turn-based, Gust kicks it up a notch with the Active Cost Time Battle bar. This bar allows you to see the order in which characters (both ally and enemy) will attack. Attack time moves from left to right, meaning that once a character reaches the far right of the bar it is their turn to act. In the first half of the game this feature doesn't really matter since characters are constantly ahead of the learning curve, but it becomes crucial to watch the bar later when you come across some seriously powerful bosses.   Once a character is allowed to move, you'll be given different options to use in battle. You can attack, defend, run--or if you're using Felt--create items that can be used in battle. Naturally, most of the time you'll attack, for which there are two main commands: Charge Attack and Break Attack. Break Attack is used to knock an enemy backwards on the ACTB bar and delay their turn.  Charge Attack charges your Skill Gauge, which, when filled up, allows you to unleash a powerful spell on the enemy or heal your party.   Weird science. Of course, Atelier Iris 2 wouldn't be a true Atelier game without alchemy. This means that if you want weapons, items, armor or spells, you're going to have to make them yourself. For that, you need recipes and their respective ingredients, which are scattered throughout Belkhyde on battlefields or in shops. Once you find everything you need you can use a save point to switch to Viese, who will then initialize the recipe in her cauldron, thus unlocking it for Mana Synthesis. Mana Synthesis (found in previous games) is a feature that allows Felt to skip the search for rare ingredients and restock his inventory using basic elements like iron and wood (which can be extracted from rocks and barrels sitting around towns and fields). And although Felt lacks the ability to initialize items, he can customize weapons that have special factors (or more preciously ~secret~ factors) that teach your party members new skills and special attacks when equipped. Items can also be customized by combining them with ingredients rich in special properties (called ~reviews~). In short, it pays to do some experimenting in order to see what you can create with your alchemy skills.   As much as we enjoy the battle and alchemy systems though, there are some issues that prevent the game from being perfect. The first is the fetch-quest aspect of Atelier Iris 2, which we've already mentioned. Another complaint is the lack of clear instructions. The game is not 100% linear, so it's important for a game like this to let the player know their options in a clear and concise manner. Azoth of Destiny doesn't always do this, and that takes away from some of the fun.  At the end of the day, Atelier Iris 2 is an enjoyable game. It doesn't attempt to knock our socks off with graphics (though the water-color backgrounds are pretty), or music (rather simple and plain at times), or convoluted storylines, but it delivers solid gameplay and a nice change of pace from other RPGs. So why we can't give it a perfect score, we still feel that fans will enjoy this pithy mix of alchemy and fun.", "date": "Feb 4, 2008"}
