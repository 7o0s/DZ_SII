Its impact has been softened not just by how long it's been available, but also by the fact that the team wrapped up production on CT Special Forces' sequel last year. The game's a better-than-average design that borrows heavily from the old-school line-up of 16-bit arcade shooters of the '90s, but there are a few quirks peppered across its production that tarnish its fun factor.  Features Two playable characters Four areas, multiple sub-missions Three different style of game levels Password save Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge)  Even though the game gives off a bit of Metal Slug flair in its look, CT: Special Forces is a little less maniacal than SNK's game design. There are definite similarities, and it's clear that Metal Slug was an inspiration for the designers at LSP. But where the NeoGeo classic offered tongue-in-cheek presentation and an over-the-top adrenaline rush of action, the CT Special Forces team scale back that design in a more careful, slower-paced arcade game with three different styles of gameplay: side-scrolling action, top-down arcade shooter, and an Operation Wolf sniper mode.  The game definitely gives off the impression that the team knows what they're doing on the Game Boy Advance. Graphically, CT Special Forces features some excellent attention to character animation and background art, putting the GBA's sprite and scrolling capabilities to use. Audiowise, well...the quality's certainly up there, but the background tunes definitely sound like they're lifted from the Generic Library of Amiga MOD Files. And there's very few of them, so prepare yourself for a bunch of repetitive music during the action.  If anything, CT Special Forces is a short but extremely challenging action title. It will take a good amount of practice and multiple plays through each level to come out victorious and earn that coveted password. Yes, CT Special Forces is a slightly no-frills GBA production, and the lack of a battery save is a bit of a downer considering that it takes a significantly long time to earn the right to continue in the game, something that should be a lot more frequent in handheld gaming. And much of the challenge of CT Special Forces unfortunately comes from ~accidental~ deaths. There are way too many ~leaps of faith~ in the level design...some pits are instant deaths, while others take players to a safe fall on a lower level. And there's no discerning between the two without taking a gamble with one of the available lives in reserve. Once a level is learned, however, you won't need to waste a spare life and can use it for actual gameplay...but that can happen several times in a specific area, since the password doesn't record which sub-mission you're in.  The action also stops awkwardly in many places for elements that just don't feel well integrated into the overall design. Was it really necessary to force players to switch to handcuffs simply to slap 'em on your prisoners? Or to change over to a grappling hook to climb up to the next part of a map, especially when it's a stiff, non-interactive transition from one place to another? Stay with the action, guys...leave that extraneous stuff on the cutting room floor.   CT: Special Forces has the unfortunate status of being released in the US more than a year and a half after its original European debut. In fact, the game's sequel has been available overseas for several months now. That doesn't sway any opinion on the current US release, however, but the timing isn't very beneficial. CT: Special Forces is a promising, original action series, but it doesn't quite live up to expectations; for a game that looks a heck of a lot like SNK's Metal Slug, it doesn't retain the charm or fun of that series, and features a lot of clunky gameplay elements that, honestly, didn't need to be there in the first place. Quirks aside, it's a solid first effort...if just a bit dated.", "date": "Jan 15, 2004"}
