Admittedly, their first slate of games weren't exactly as revolutionary or as tuned into the ~mobile lifestyle~ as the highly visible company founder Trip Hawkins had hoped. Or promised. (That doesn?t mean they sold poorly, though. Bubble Ducky did a decent amount of business.) The mobile firm is now following up their first sports effort, Baseball Heroes with another trip to the arena, this time the competitive world of college basketball.The basketball category is, right now, pretty well covered in mobile. For the three-on-three NCAA Hoops 2005 to break through, it needed a hook to make it a greater must-play than, say, JAMDAT's basketballer. It seems that DChoc's hook of choice is to offer a strange lack of control not entirely dissimilar to Baseball Heroes, but with some really impressive sim aspects to soften the blow.NCAA Hoops 2005 includes almost 60 college ball teams, but as rules seem to dictate, none of the players are mentioned by face or name. Instead, each players is given a four-category skill set that covers passing, defense, outside shooting, and inside shooting. And these stats actually affect game play.DChoc's new baller lets you also adjust team strategies, such as how close to play D, or if you detect an uneven match-up, to really drive it to the hole with extreme aggression. But that's really as far as you get to go. You really have little control over the individual players. AI -- and sometimes very questionable AI -- picks up the slack. It's like NCAA Hoops 2005 has it's own B-Spec mode. You have to hope against hope that your players don't leave a man wide open, but more often than not, they do. Oh, and there is no such thing as rebounding in NCAA Hoops 2005. That's right, one of the biggest parts of the game of basketball has been jettisoned into space. How bizarre since so many basketball games are really decided on which team does the better job of recovering the ball after a missed shot.Honestly, we were really driven crazy by this lack of control. It's totally understandable to streamline the sport a little because this is a cellphone, after all, not a DS or PSP. But it is possible to present decent arcade-style b-ball on a handset, not just leave it up to algorithms.NCAA Hoops 2005 has a pretty decent online scoreboard system that allows you to keep track of national standings. Big sports fans will enjoy this feature. They'll likely also like the tournament set-up, which lets you play for a place in an NCAA tourney. Also solid are the visuals. Solid, but not spectacular. With sprites this small, good animation is expected -- and delivered. So are some good digital effects.I found it hard to get past the fact I didnt have real hands-on control over my players. When my team blew an opportunity to stop the computer from scoring because it foolishly left a man open -- the kind of blunder that would put you on the bench for a while -- I groaned aloud. That's never a good sign. However, there may be an audience that would appreciate playing as more of a coach than player, guiding the team from the sideline. I guess I'm just not part of that audience.", "date": "Mar 2, 2005"}
