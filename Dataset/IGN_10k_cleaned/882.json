{"name": "Pocket Fighter", "name_review": "Pocket Fighter (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/20/pocket-fighter-import", "text": "In Japan, the WonderSwan is similar to the Playstation 2  despite the fact that the existing software lineup is sorely lacking, everybody is buying the system like it's going out of style. While the majority of the games have been shoddy, officially-licensed rush-jobs from Bandai (who seems to bear an odd resemblance to the Acclaim of olde), we're occasionally treated to a diamond in the rough  and Capcom's Pocket Fighter looks like one of the few games that might be worth buying.  Pocket Fighter was born in the arcades, a wacky hybrid of Capcom fighters and the ~super-deformed~ anime style. This is your traditional one-on-one brawler, with large-headed versions of Street Fighter characters duking it out with excessive amounts of cutesiness. As an added bonus, the WonderSwan version features a card battle mode  along with networking options via Bandai's cel phone system. Features: Two modes of play: Action and Card Battle Link cable support 12 selectable characters Data exchange via WonderGate Only for WonderSwan  If you've ever played a Street Fighter game, you probably know what to expect: it's Ken, Ryu, and a bunch of other vehement guys and gals jumping around and throwing fireballs at each other. In a bizarre twist, the characters transform into different outfits as they fight  Morrigan becomes a nurse  and rams her opponents with wheelchairs, while Sakura dons a kimono and whacks people with a broom. Weird stuff  though I still can't figure out what half of the moves are supposed to represent, thanks to the tiny size of the WonderSwan's display.   Just like Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, Pocket Fighter puts a large emphasis on collecting gems. When an attack lands on an opponent, they drop a jewel. Pick it up, and you'll add some power to your Mighty Combo Gauge, which opens up new combos and special attacks. While the arcade version featured blue, yellow, and red gems, the WonderSwan features gems that are light gray, off-gray, and dark gray. Needless to say, any strategy to be had by collecting specific colors has been lost in the murky translation.   Despite the drab-looking gems, the graphics are boatloads better than anything you'll ever see on the classic Game Boy. There's an impressive amount of animation for each character, and the well-defined sprites stick out against the static backgrounds. There's a significant amount of blurring, though  but we'll chalk that up to the WonderSwan's cheap LCD screen, as opposed to any programming deficiencies.   This time, the typical six-button control has been scaled down to three keys  one for punching, kicking, and special attacks. The first thing you'll want to do is customize the controls, since the default setup is simply terrible  for cryin' out loud, the special attack key is mapped to the set of buttons above the d-pad! You'll want to reassign this to the A+B button combination, which makes the game much more playable.  Once you get up and running, it's standard Capcom fare  if your Combo Gauge is charged up, impressive-looking attacks can be pulled off by simple button-mashing and quarter-circle-forward fireball movements.  Sadly, this is Pocket Fighter's greatest weakness  though the game's control is spot-on, the WonderSwan controller is not up to snuff for this type of game. Since the D-pad consists of four separate buttons, executing a successful Dragon Punch motion takes more luck than skill  and I have no idea how you're supposed to perform Zangief's 360-degree D-pad spin move.  If you can get over the severe problems in physical control, you'll find a lot to love  aside from Arcade mode, there's Point Battle (where you fight all the of game's characters with a singular life bar), and Free Battle (versus mode via a link cable). There's also an extras menu in the options screen, which unlocks goodies once you start repeatedly beating the game.  By far, the juiciest add-on is Card Battle mode, which cashes in on the Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering mania that's been sweeping Japan.. In each match, you're dealt a deck of six cards  these consist of attacks, special moves, power-ups, gems, and escapes. After you select your cards, the computer tabulates your stats against the CPU's  if your hand comes out on top, you'll be the only one doing the damage. You can also unlock new cards for display in the Card Gallery mode, and trade them with your buddies over a link cable. While Card Battle is fun for a few rounds, the slow pacing and somewhat unexciting gameplay remind you that this is primarily a fighting game.  Japanese gamers get to have even more fun, thanks to Pocket Fighter's networking options. Using the WonderGate system, you can link your WonderSwan to a standard DoCoMo cel phone for extra online goodies. Your score rankings can be uploaded, and special cards featuring seven ~popular female characters~ can be unlocked via a quick download (you can't play as 'em in Card Battle mode, so don't get too excited). Surprisingly, Training mode and the sound test can only be opened by going online  what's up with that?  Despite numerous problems with the d-pad, I enjoyed Pocket Fighter. The fighting engine is solid, the graphics are distinctive, and there are simply a ton of gameplay modes and extra options for the hardcore gamers in the crowd. Though it's not in the same league as SNK's godly Match of the Millennium, it's solid enough in its own right. If you were an early adopter of an import WonderSwan, this game will finally justify its purchase  if not, you might want to give it a glance when it comes stateside.", "date": "Apr 20, 2000"}
