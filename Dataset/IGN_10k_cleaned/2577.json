For those who haven't played Duke Nukem, Doom, Quake or any other of those titles who share the same genre, Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown is a first person shooter that arms gamers with a bunch of guns and lets them venture through crazy levels filled with nasty looking monsters. Sound fun? It is.  Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown is thankfully more than just a port. In addition to the complete re-rendering of the weapons and enemies, the game also features a death-match mode that allows you to link up to a friend and nuke each other.  The game plays exactly like its PC predecessor. And, to improve its Doom-like gameplay, the game comes analog compatible. Using the analog controller definitely helps, especially when you're simultaneously trying to strafe and shoot an enemy.  I do have a confession to make. Although this game moves and plays really well, the graphics tend to get super-pixelated when you get close to an enemy or any of the rendered backgrounds. For example, when you run into one of those L.A.P.D. piggies, they look like jig-saw puzzles, rather than scary monsters. A small flaw, but one that should be noted for all you graphics tarts.  But besides the semi-fuzzy graphics, GT Interactive has included everything from the PC version including all the levels, monsters, and Duke Nukemisms. And to prove that this game is not a direct port, Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown also comes with six additional levels that weren't included in its PC counterpart. Yeah!   If you like first person shooters, and you want to blast some L.A.P.D. piglets, pick up Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown. It's old, but it's fun.  Jay Boor", "date": "Dec 2, 1997"}
