This 16-bit artifact captures the sliver of time between Jackson's pop ascendancy during the ~Thriller~ era and his tortuous downfall fueled by vanity and dark allegations. As such, it's nearly impossible to look back on his Genesis game completely severed from all of the horrible things we've heard about Jackson in recent years. What keeps this from being a complete exercise in futility is the almost relief felt when realizing this is one of the blandest action-platformers of the generation, saved from wholesale badness by strange sparkles of Jackson's kooky-cool. Because the game itself is banal, drubbing the game no longer feels like adding one more Corgi to the dogpile.    Moonwalker catches up to Michael Jackson in full ~Smooth Criminal~ regalia. He's a snap brimmed hero pushing through a juke joint full of Mr. Big's suited-up thugs and kidnapped children. Jackson must push back against this army of hooligans with his superior moves, such as a kick that's rooted in Jackson's own choreography. In what is surely an unintentional joke, our hero -- quite literally -- has ~twinkle toes.~ When Jackson kicks, magic stars float from his feet to take down enemies within the extended range.   Jackson's entire offensive is based on his dancing. When he jumps over pinball tables or on top of cars, his legs curl under him and his finger goes into the air. He can spin in place to charge his magic and then let loose with a hat attack that zips across the screen and knocks over incoming foes. Or he can go critical and inspire all of the on-screen thugs to join in his intoxicating dance set. Then there's the moonwalking, Jackson's velvet triumph -- a move used to scoot away from a successful attack and can be capped off with an emphatic crotch grab. It's just bizarre. And for a few minutes, the strangeness of Moonwalker is entertaining. How else will Jackson use his dancing to save the children?   Gimme that girl before I grab myself. OWWW!!  But this Z-movie ~so bad it's good~ charm is fleeting. Moonwalker is a lazily produced game. The stages are entirely monotonous, dressed up with repeating backdrops. Even worse, the enemies are paint-by-number thugs with zero personality and the same tailor. With only the occasional palette-switch, every level has just one or two enemy types that are on an endless loop, like a drum track in a Rockwell song. Compound this with the single line of AI code that drives each and every one: Run left/right and collide with Jackson. Dealing with these morons while searching doors and windows for missing kids across a dozen stages is woefully dull. Because you cannot fight the stage boss (which is typically just one or more of the stage's parade of repetitive thugs or zombies) until you find a set number of kids, you spend a lot of time backtracking around a level fighting the same enemies over and over.   When you do manage to find the final little girl, though, Moonwalker employs another dose of weird. Bubbles flies in on a star, lands on Jackson's shoulders, and then points the way to the boss encounter. Finding the boss is not a Herculean task, though. You just sorta walk into it. The presence of Bubbles in the game can only be explained then as something Jackson himself must have insisted upon. Oh, and if Bubbles and Jackson playing Master-Blaster isn't kooky enough for you, there is this an absolute mind-scrambler hidden in the game. It's a hold-over from the vastly superior arcade version of Moonwalker. If you rescue a specific child in the right order, Jackson turns into a robot. He can then shoot lasers out of his eyes. Again: Crazy.     The one upside of Moonwalker, however, is the music. Even though it's pure MIDI and on a constant loop, Jackson's songs are quite good. ~Smooth Criminal~ is indeed the highlight here, but the library of beep-boop songs, such as ~Billie Jean,~ are still reminders that no matter what you think of Jackson himself, he remains an incredible musician and performer.  You cannot take anything away from Jackson's musical and performance legacy, but this bit of vanity simply falls apart due to pure laziness. The dance moves are a hoot at the beginning, as are the first few sights of the game's weirdness, but then the whole thing collapses into banality. Everything is stuck on repeat. You may want to rescue this one from a garage sale for the quirk factor, but it will not spend much time in your Genesis.", "date": "Mar 31, 2008"}
