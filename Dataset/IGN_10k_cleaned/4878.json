Gamers snapped up copies of Activision's web-slinger at a record rate, putting Spider-Man 2 at the top of several sales charts. Nokia is hoping that a special commissioned N-Gage version of Spider-Man 2 that launched around the time of the QD will generate some serious heat for the fledging platform which aims to erase the lingering bad taste of the original N-Gage.   But can even the legendary Spider-Man pull off such a feat?   Features:   5 3-D levels  15 2-D levels  Bosses include Doc Ock and Lizard  N-Gage Arena scoreboard   Activision's N-Gage game roughly follows the story of the movie, but with some extra play elements thrown int o increase the game's length, not unlike what it tried with the Spider-Man 2 console games. But rather than create a full, free-roaming romp through Manhattan, developer Digital Eclipse got the go-ahead to throw in some additional bosses like The Lizard and Rhino and cull together a series of action sequences that fill out the game.   Spider-Man 2 combines two game play styles in an attempt to create a solid experience. Action-filled 2-D side-scrolling segments are designed with the 16-bit fan in mind -- the ones that remember the solid Spidey titles on the Genesis. These fifteen levels concentrate on Spider-Man's exceptional strength, as he flattens bad guys with hard punches and kicks, as well using his stickiness to overcome platforming obstacles.    During these 2-D sequences, Spidey must adhere to walls and ceilings to avoid bad guys, getting the drop on them just in time to land some wicked hooks. And when he's not bashing bad dudes, he's rescuing hostages or disposing of toxic waste. Sure, those parts weren't in the movie, but did you really want to play a game based on Peter Parker trying to slip past Bruce Campbell's smug theater usher? (Actually, maybe you do.)   After a few 2-D levels (followed by a boss battle), Spidey swings into a 3-D stage, webbing through downtown Manhattan. While the 2-D sequences are entertaining enough, these 3-D races between skyscapers, grabbing tokens and icons, are an absolute mess. The N-Gage truly shows its limitations here, as the frame rate is awful and the polygons and textures are too jaggy and muddy to enjoy. The control during these sequences is also a little wonky, as it seems driving a Sherman tank through Manhattan would be more responsive.   Spider-Man 2's 2-D sequences are easily its best side. The control is much more solid, as Spider-Man actually does what you tell him to do. Cracking skulls and jumping from building to building is easy to get the hang of.   It's hard to judge the game's visuals, thanks to the dual style. We already mentioned how horrid and sub-PSone like the 3-D levels are. The 2-D sequences fare much better, as Spidey enjoys some great detail and animation. His moves look cool, and everything seems to gel together quite well. It's almost as if at some point, the development team was ordered to stuff in some 3-D elements just to differentiate it from the Game Boy Advance Spider-Man 2 game.    The story is told through static pictures instead of video cut-scenes, which you would expect considering the game comes on such a small chip. No room for vid in there. The faces of the main character's, like Peter and Ock, look somewhat like their big screen counterparts. Probably just enough to avoid paying for likeness rights.   The game, though, does have some good audio. Punches are landed with satisfying ~thwacks~ and webs are slung with trademark ~thwips.~ The music is pretty decent. You won't necessarily want the soundtrack, but you won't be trying to maneuver your thumb over the N-Gage's speaker, either.  Spider-Man 2 is an unfortunate underachiever. The game has lofty intentions by mixing up gameplay styles, but what gamers end up with a side-scrolling game of Game Boy Advance caliber (which is not an insult) interrupted by jaggy, un-fun PSone 3-D swingfests. At this point, designers shouldn't be spotlighting the N-Gage's dated tech, as Spider-Man 2's 3-D sequences make a solid argument that Nokia should have upgraded the gaming gear inside the QD. If you own a N-Gage or a QD, Spider-Man 2 is a decent purchase -- just lower any expectations you have coming off the superior console version.", "date": "Aug 3, 2004"}
