Not only because the issues are so controversial, but because you have to have to know such a huge amount of historical context--and there's always somebody who knows more about an issue than you do. And here I am living in a very political city, during an election year, and the country is bitterly divided. It's an opportune time for someone to release a game about politics, and The Political Machine fills those shoes pretty well, although it's not without some stumbling blocks.  TPM is about running for President. You get 41 turns, each one lasting a week in game time, and you can choose Quick Play with limited configurability options, a campaign mode that lets you choose your candidate, and Fantasy Mode. In addition to adjusting the level of domestic and foreign tranquility, the health of the economy, and overall difficulty, this mode lets you adjust how many millions of dollars the candidates start with, how aware the country is of them, how much it costs to get endorsements and operatives.  Endorsements come from a selection of ten special interest groups like ~The National Gun Owner's Association,~ the ~National Association for Women,~ and other familiar groups with names changed to protect the guilty. When you win an endorsement, you lock that group so that your opponent can't take it. (Interestingly, though, the candidates have real names, likenesses, and corresponding statistics for things like military experience, media bias, and minority appeal). The interest groups you align with affect which states will be more favorable to you. There are no Independent candidates or running mates available, but you can create your own person from scratch.  Collaborate with the Christian Confederation and you get a boost from the states that favor ~traditional values~ and a decline in the states that favor abortion rights. Unfortunately, you can align with groups that have partially opposing views. This can be tactically advantageous, but it's not very realistic. Also, the more controversial groups are generally too, well, controversial to make it worth joining forces with them, so you end up going for the same groups every time.    Each turn gives you a dozen action points, and you'll earn more over the course of the campaign. During each turn, you'll have the opportunity to launch a media campaign targeting a specific topic, raise funds, give a targeted speech, build political capital, and build a campaign HQ. You'll have three tiers of HQs, starting with an outpost and ending with a $1,000,000 edifice, with each upgrade earning you more presence, opening up more campaign topics in that state, and bringing in more funds.  Unfortunately, topic interest veers very strongly towards just a few key issues, like the war in Iraq, the war on terror, and, coming in third place in virtually every state, a topical of historical context. Michigan likes talk about crime and jobs, while Texas likes to talk capital punishment and Florida loves people who promote Social Security. While the large weight given to Iraq and terrorism makes the game feel compellingly current, it also limits replayability and long-term appeal. During our last election, for example, these two issues weren't even on the radar.  Still, there's a lot of nuance to uncover. You buy political capital with your action points and, in addition to spending that on endorsements, you'll open up a list of state-specific operatives who can make a huge difference over time. The Consultant raises state awareness by 4% each week, while the Intimidator reduces the opponent's by 5%. Since research has shown that negative advertising is more effective, the percentage disparity makes sense, but it doesn't really bear out elsewhere in the game. I didn't get the impression of a tangible difference between giving a speech where I promoted the war on terror and giving a speech were I claimed my candidate opposed it, even though the country, in this game, is near-unanimous (which is another issue in itself). It seemed to be more of a role-playing decision than a strategic one.      You can also hire operatives that give you a large, one-time boost that's more useful later in the game--although the operatives cost more points the farther you are in the campaign. If you find yourself in a heated media battle, you can hire a Webmaster who will reduce advertising costs. Unfortunately, you can't move these guys around, but you can end media campaigns to trim the budget, once they've served their purpose.  In addition to the operatives, you'll sometimes get free publicity. A movie star might pop up in one state, or you'll be invited to do an interview for a website. The interview poses a question on a timer, and you have to answer decisively from a list in order to get a national boost from it. Some of the answers are a little long, which forces you to skim through them in order to maximize the return, but it's otherwise pretty intriguing because it forces you to think about what your personal views are, because the responses are fairly involved and informed. It's easy to ram home your fantasy campaign and not consider alternative views, but the interviews have an interesting way of giving you pause.  Midway through the campaign, you'll get to select from a running mate. They'll give a small weekly boost in awareness to the state they're in, and a smaller one to the nearby states, but the game doesn't allow him to stump for you, choosing instead to only let you move him around and nudge the swing states a little. And since I could choose John Edwards as a running mate, he's a no-brainer every time. Being a Southern Democrat gives a left-leaning candidate much more appeal.  Despite all of this depth, the opponent AI has an oversimplified system where it seems to favor a sheer number of states, rather than focusing on electoral votes. I was able to make a decisive win each time by grabbing California, Texas, Florida, Ohio, New York, Michigan, Illinois, and other high-population states, while my opponent breathlessly canvassed the nation without much electoral prioritizing. If anything, I would have expected a parameter that knocked me down if I just paid attention to the large states, or a bonus for grabbing states that were historically difficult for my party to win.   Although The Political Machine isn't quite as fleshed out as I would have liked and dates itself by focusing heavily on the issues of 2004, it's still fun and surprisingly accessible. You can create your own candidate from scratch, or have Al Gore and even Bill Clinton take another stab at the White House, attempt to get a woman or African-American elected President, and unlock historical figures. And while the opponent AI is a little too predictable, TPM supports multiplayer, which is great once your friends get the hang of the nuances. For me, running for President isn't nearly as interesting as being the President, but this campaign simulator is fun in its own right, and Stardock is known for constantly expanding and improving its titles after release.", "date": "Sep 20, 2004"}
