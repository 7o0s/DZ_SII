From the first day I laid my hands on Civilization in 1991, I've been hooked on world conquest games.  So just imagine my delight when Master of Orion hit a year later.  Pfft...why worry about conquering the world when I could take control of the entire universe? Muwhahahaha!  It was games like Civilization and the SimTex Master series that really embodied what PC gaming was all about to me.    About five years later a little-known title called Imperium Galactica found its way onto my hard drive and, while the interface wasn't quite as slick as Master of Orion and the micro-management aspects got a bit tedious at times, it too lived up to my expectations of what PC games should be all about.  Now here we are in the 21st century, and after four years of hard work, Digital Reality has finally finished the sequel to their original space conquest game.  I have to say, the sequel lives up to all of the expectations I had for this title when I first saw it, and even surpasses many of them.  It's absolutely brilliant, and IG2 brought back fond memories of the PC gaming days of yore.  You can think of Imperium Galactica II as Master of Orion to the tenth power.  Everything you remember from the greatest space conquest game in existence is in IG2, and there's much, much more.  This variable speed real-time strategy game combines and blends more genres than any other game I can recall.  It's a space strategy conquest game, it's a ground-based RTS, a space-based RTS, it's an RPG, it's a city building sim...  There's just so much here that it's easy to see why it took four years to put the finishing touches on the game.  While the ground-based and space-based combat might not live up to the likes of Red Alert or Homeworld, the combination of the individual elements make for one of the most detailed, in-depth, far reaching space conquest games ever.   Hopefully you've already read our extensive preview of Imperium Galactica: Alliances, and you already know a little bit about the background of the game.  I won't go into the backstory again, but I should at least mention the three races you can play.  There's the militaristic Kra'hen, the devious and subversive Shinari, and the Solarians, which carry a nice balance between a heavy hand and a crafty mind.  Your ultimate goal in IG2 is to capture as much of the galaxy as possible, and crush the other races.  There are several ways to go about this.  If you play as the Kra'hen, your best means of conquest obviously lies in your military might, while the Shinari are best suited to using their highly-skilled spies to crumble enemy empires from the inside.  IG2 follows the same philosophy of most other conquest games: more people = more money = greater availability to advanced technologies and equipment.  Even so, the game isn't just about hoarding the most resources.  The game really does do a great job of balancing micro-management with a series of puzzle-like decisions that affect the way the game unfolds.  For example, one of your colonies may be in danger of being destroyed by a wayward meteor and you have to figure out a way to save your citizenry before the ill-fated colony is flattened.  You may also pick up a fed-up scientist or general from an enemy empire who will help you research faster or strengthen your military forces.  These random side-quests really add a lot to the game in terms of creating atmosphere, and are accompanied by some of the best CGI videos I've seen in a game...plus the voice-overs for the videos are actually well acted, something I'm not used to in games.   Overall, with so much to do, the game is very challenging, and you're certainly not assured victory with any of the three races.  However, I did find it a bit easier to win with the Shinari.  Maybe I'm just a devious person at heart, but inciting enemy colonies to revolt and join my empire seemed to be the fastest way to assure victory.  You do encounter other races throughout the game, and it would have been nice to play them as well, but no big whoop.  As every game of IG2 is different, even when you play with the same race, there's not much to complain about when it comes to replayability.  The interface in Imperium Galactica II is simply the most elegant and graceful I've ever seen in any game.  There's a lot to do in this game, and with all of this power at your hands, it will take a while to get used to the interface.  But the fully voiced tutorial does a great job of getting you up on the basics of gameplay.  After you get used to it, you'll be clicking, commanding, building, researching, spying, and conquering the galaxy in a heartbeat.  Although you basically have three different gameplay views in IG2: planetside, tactical space battles, and the giant starmap, the interface stays consistent throughout each, so once you learn it in one view, it's not hard to get used to the others.  Like the rest of the game, the interface is a visual treat, and it was fun just clicking around the various menus just to see what the designers added to the menus as you got deeper and deeper and deeper.     IG2 supports up to 8 players over a LAN or the Internet.  Unlike the single player game, multiplay happens in real time, meaning you have a lot to do the entire time you're playing.  It can be daunting at first, but it's a lot of fun once you get it down.  Unfortunately, there's not a lot of competition on the 'net right now, but I'm hoping as more people stumble across the beauty that is IG2, the online community will continue to grow and grow.  In order to save time in multiplayer affairs, there's no strategic 3D ground or space combat.  Instead the computer handles all of the in-game battles.  But I don't think I'd want to play out a full 40+ hour galaxy conquest in one sitting anyway.  Overall, Imperium Galactica II is a gem of a game that's fun, deep, and absolutely beautiful.  It's not an original idea and it doesn't do any one gameplay aspect better than any other stand-alone game, but what it does do is combine several different elements into an extremely solid package that's entertaining, challenging, and incredibly rewarding if you're the kind of person who can sit still for more than 4 hours at a time.  I really hope this game does well, because it's by far one of the best games I've played this year so far, and it certainly has a good chance of grabbing Strategy Game of the Year.  The problem is that games like this get easily overlooked, but trust me, you won't be disappointed with IG2 if you do decide to pick it up the next time you're at the software store.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "May 10, 2000"}
