Is it for the complex character work, the fascinating moral dilemmas, the family drama, the snappy dialogue and the thoughtful study of the evil that men do? Or is it for the swearing, killing and boobies?    Well, in all honesty, it's probably both. It really wouldn't be what it is without its more cerebral elements, though. Granted, The Sopranos show shot to fame initially for being a bit like Goodfellas, but it quickly evolved into something far more layered, and one of the most challenging drama serials on television. Unfortunately, the inevitably atrocious videogame adaptation fails to acknowledge this. In fact, all it seems to have seen of the show is a couple of trailers in which some gangsters hit each other and the episode where [Spoiler alert, though it happened way back in the second season:] Big Pussy gets whacked.    Giving a whole new meaning to the phrase 'back hander'. So, the show's carefully constructed tableaux of psychoanalysis and introspection translates into, yes, some gangsters hitting each other. Slightly surprisingly, it isn't some cut-rate Grand Theft Auto clone with driving and free-roaming locations (a la Scarface: The World is Yours), but rather it's an absolutely linear beat-'em-up. It's so insanely restrictive that, for instance, there's even an invisible wall running alongside the line in the middle of road outside Satriale's Pork Store. Because Heaven forbid you might want to stand on the opposite pavement, even though it's been rendered anyway.  As it turns out, you're not even allowed inside the store - apparently walking into a sausage shop disrespects the Family. It's just the one three metre stretch of curb for you, sonny.    Significantly less fun than it looks. Which is saying something. Really, the game's only anything to do with The Sopranos at all by dint of most of the show's cast providing voices (fortunately they're all clearly comfortable enough in their characters after all these years that their lines don't sound phoned in) and by including several key locations, such as the aforementioned Satriale's. Your job, playing as the initially mistrusted illegitimate son of Big Pussy, is purely to be dragged from one location to the next by various Sopranos cast members, be given a couple of minutes to run around aimlessly and perhaps go ~Ooh, that looks slightly familiar, in a horribly sparse, blurry kind of way!~ before being told to hit someone, or someone starts hitting you. That someone can be anyone from other gangsters to construction workers to gym beefcakes to fat old men to porn stars, and even a pair of lawyers who inexplicably set at you while you're urinating. Such is the game's slavish dedication to including mook-filled renditions of the show's every major set that it's genuinely surprising there isn't a level where you have to beat up deranged therapy patients in Doctor Melfi's office.    Oh God, the combat is bad though. Theoretically, there's a rudimentary combo system in there that seems to have been ripped wholesale from some ancient, forgotten wrestling game, but all it actually boils down to is alternately mashing X and Square until your opponent falls over, or you're prompted to perform a special move using the D-pad. If you really, really want to, you can drag a goon over to certain highlighted pieces of furniture and press some slightly different buttons to finish them off by bashing their heads into it. If you really want to. But you won't.     In the second half of the game's mercifully brief duration, you'll occasionally be attacked by three or four eerily similar opponents at once, who immediately surround you and prevent all movement. This shakes things up very slightly, in that you now have to endure a few minutes of being bounced between each and punched repeatedly in the head, all the while frantically trying to hammer enough buttons to let you get up off the floor, until you're either killed or the game randomly gives you enough space to pick your attackers off one by one. Nevertheless, the only sense of threat comes along in the game's final hour or so; the rest is as easy as unconcernedly signing away the videogame rights to your critically-acclaimed TV show in exchange for an enormous wad of money.    Even odder than the totally broken combat are longish sequences that just see you ferried awkwardly from one side of a small location to another, having a couple of pre-set conversations, then being asked if you want to start the mission or not. No thanks, we'd rather hang around here for a bit longer, staring at badly-rendered, near-static NPCs who all hold their weirdly-curved arms out slightly in front of them, as if they're each carrying an invisible sheep.    Phwoar! Look at the oblongs on that! Perversely, there is one extra element to the game, but only if you deliberately screw things up. The only way to directly kill people, apart from at pre-determined plot moments, is to shoot them. All the savage beatings with iron bars in the world won't result in anything more fatal than their rolling around on the floor a bit (though the wriggling does eventually stop, but it's unclear as to whether they've expired, passed out or the game's just forgotten they're there). So, guns it is, using a brainless auto-lock system that eschews any need for skill. Every time you shoot someone, however, you lose - sigh - 'respect'. Apparently, caving in a someone's skull with a porn Oscar trophy is fine, but gunshots demean the Family. So, if your respect drops too low, the game - without warning - switches to a cut-scene of you being executed by Tony Soprano.   Fortunately and depressingly, given that you only need the gun less than half a dozen times in total, you have to actively pursue such failure. Oh, and there's also a poker mini-game in there, because poker's a gangstery thing to do, right? Also a gangstery thing to do is stare at cuboid strippers, receive hilariously puppet-like lapdances, steal anything of value not nailed down (and have it instantly transformed into money, which can then be futilely spent on unlocking concept art) and swear constantly. Though such elements do make (much better-realised) appearances in the show too, part of the appeal and the success of The Sopranos is that it tries very hard to play against Mafia stereotypes - but its interactive spin-off drags things violently back to the dark ages of gangster typecasting.Given the complexity of the source material and the turgid history of similar spin-offs, the odds of this doing The Sopranos justice were always incredibly low - but it's astounding that it turned out quite as moronic as it has. Reportedly, Sopranos creator David Chase was involved, which meant there was at least some hope of quality control. Clearly not; he seems to have sketched a passable story of new blood rising through the family ranks, then thrown his hands up to the rest. The games most redeeming feature, apart from the reasonable voicework (though even thats let down by bland, clumsy dialogue, laden with poor toilet humour), is that its over very quickly. You can stretch it out longer if, for inexplicable masochistic reasons, you want to, but really youre looking at about five hours of bewildered misery, and absolutely zero replay value outside of that poker mini-game. Compared to this, that flaccid Godfather game suddenly looks something of a gem.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
