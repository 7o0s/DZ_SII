It's the one with all the crunched, neglected delectable snacks at the bottom and the good, fully flavored ones at the top. Now age said chips by two years, and then give them to someone who likes to eat straight out of the bag, all the while licking his fingers and dropping half chewed pieces back down into the depths of the foil-esque wrapping as if it were a sort of collector for waste that falls from that mouth of horror (yes I do know someone like this, and it is very considerate of him not to soil the couch by slobbering everywhere at the cost of tainting the chips).   After the aged, fattening potato snacks have been thoroughly soiled by the saliva of a man that average folk dread even speaking to, would you still like to eat some? The bottom layer is stale dust, the top layer is infected by the pig drool from a couch dwelling slob, but the middle layer could still have a few gems in it. And that's where we are now... Is it better to search through the rubble looking for the diamond, or would it be wiser to go to the grocery store and buy a new bag of potato chips, ones that perhaps even have a different, better flavor?  Make that Afghani rubble... Is it Good? Bad? Honestly I'm not qualified or prepared to dish out a damning sermon on righteousness and the supposed moral obligations of Americans to not dabble in touchy subjects, nor am I willing to justify the game's existence by recanting the first amendment and whatever other hypocritical anti-P.C. rhetoric may be abound. I just don't care. I'm reviewing a game, and as far as I see it, Task Force Dagger is no less valid than Desert Strike was a decade ago. If we can have Grand Theft Auto then I suppose we can have this. But I must say, the overall shoddy quality of the product does not help it in shaking the impression that it's merely an exploitative attempt to capitalize off of modern sentiment. Uh oh, did I go and give away the gist of this review?  Two years ago Delta Force: Land Warrior was released. It was a more refined action title than the couple similarly named ones that came before it, but it was still lacking, wanting, needing. Sadly and strangely enough, Task Force Dagger is that game...exactly. Only a few new additions keep it from being branded the Gold, Platinum, or goodness forbid, Game of the Year edition. But the additions don't make it new. They make it more akin to a mod, lowbrow expansion, or $30 standalone mission pack, which Novalogic brazenly admits it to be.  Delta Force is technically a first and third-person shooter, but since the third-person camera is so terribly broken, bad enough in fact to make even the Sammo Hung directed fifteen minute long blurred out slow-motion finale of Mr. Nice Guy look good, it's prudent never to jump out of the skulls of the special crack commandos on the job. And it's unfortunately hard to refrain from leaping out into the wondrous world of the third-person because the in-view weapon models are an ugly spectacle to behold. Circuses would turn them away. 3D weapons that we've become accustomed to in games like everything else in the known universe have been forsaken and replaced by lacking 2D models. No animation, no lighting, no feel. It's either these cardboard cutouts that aren't even reasonably high quality, carefully angled photographs, or nothing. No gun may have at one point in time worked for Rainbow Six fans, but that doesn't make it any more acceptable.  At least the terrible external camera system keeps the obscene character models from ever being seen, assuming of course looking at the enemy never occurs. Blocky, bland, out of place, repetitive, generic, and stiff, the models of Task Force Dagger are only outshone by the lacking environments.  The voxel terrain (for which this series is perhaps best known for) allows for staggering view distances, but shimmers, twitches, and contorts at debilitating levels. All at once I was hit with an effect that was like a sinful three-way love affair between the Jell-O of Kingpin, the terrain molding of Starsiege, and heat waves that pour off black asphalt in the hottest of summers. It's a little of each and it's everywhere, which makes turning, moving and looking (three things that are generally considered vital in an FPS) quite the headache inducing experience that no amount of a AA or anisotropic filtering will ever correct. A far view distance is nice, but when it's really no further than Project IGI's, MechWarrior 4's, or perhaps even the new America's Army's and yet still manages to come with the price of epilepsy, there are problems.   But twitchy terrain is quickly remedied by going inside, where suddenly the framerate will inexplicably drop and everything will switch from twitch to square. Apparently my Pentium 4 and GeForce 3 are no longer top-of-the-line. From brown to white and white to brown it goes. When it'll stop, no one knows. And this isn't the only time performance suffers. If something ever blows up, expect to see a slideshow. The explosions here seem to be taken straight from Comanche 4. Good! But they're toned down a bit. Bad! And they cause severe framerate problems. Bad! If a barrel ignites, the screen can move so slowly that I find myself with ample time to take my hand off the mouse, scratch my ass, then my crotch, then my eye, and still have plenty seconds left to put it back down before play picks up again.        Getting from the joy of the corrupted outdoors to the bliss of painfully bland and choppy insides and blowing things up in-between is the problem with and crux of, the game. Moving from one place to another across these vast distances and always engaging enemies from afar is fun for a whole mission. To begin with, it's all way too easy. The only difficulty comes from an excess of enemies and their ability to randomly clip you from afar. This does not qualify as intelligence, superior soldier training, or combat. It's dumb luck.  See, they are stupid, lame, sheep, cannon fodder... The troops in this game are about as clever as the walls they don't bother hiding behind. Inattentive guards in towers, people who don't seem to mind their comrades being blown apart right in front of them, soldiers who shoot grenades that land twenty feet in front of them when you're actually two hundred meters away, and more who can't quite comprehend that not getting shot involves running away from the bullets and not toward them are all the challenge Delta Force has to offer. The only time you'll ever die is if you don't play cautiously enough.  It's not a game of stealth or tactics. It's a plodding game. Crouch walk through the missions instead of run and slowly peek around every corner and the day will be won. There is no depth to any of the simplistic waypoint driven scenarios or campaign missions. Some of these come in the day, in the snow,  at night, in a base (parachuting in is admittedly pretty cool), and still others start in helicopters or boat rides, where it seems, by chance, sometimes the mission will begin with you not standing firmly in the helicopter or on the boat, but rather plummeting to your death or drowning. Bad as it all is, it's worse because every one of these problems was first found in Land Warrior. After all this time no one thought to fix or improve any of it... Nothing.   Most baffling is why Novalogic would even choose to release this thirty dollar game, especially when the company has the awesome might of Comanche 4 powering the cool looking Black Hawk Down, which happens to be perched just on the horizon. That engine is easily capable of doing everything this game needed and more. Why risk the scorn, the bad taste? Why taint the Delta Force name the eve prior to dropping what will no doubt be its biggest and best effort?   The saving grace of Task Force Dagger is the arsenal of static weapons that also happen to make noise... Good noise. Some sound especially developed, but the music is muted, the environments are decidedly dead (in keeping with their wasteland appearance) and the enemies all shout similar blurbs at similar times and even sound like they're all at the same distance (even though some could in reality be hundreds of meters away).  Play has no tactical precision, no reflex intensive action, and no unquantifiable fun (however subjective the latter may be).  But here's what 's new! (I like bulleted lists, by the way.)  25 new Afghanistan missions that play exactly like before.  10 Special Forces soldiers with unique abilities that don't matter. 30 weapons, 17 are new.  This one is being filled to make it seem as if the game had more to offer.  10 new multiplayer maps, same old modes.   What did you think about Task Force Dagger?  Yup, multiplayer is there and comes with plenty of ways to get into it, like search and destroy (destroy targets in enemy base), capture the flag (capturing of some sort of flag), flagball (steal the bacon), attack and defend (assault), king of the hill (domination), deathmatch, and of course team modes. But in light of recent advancements in the genre, and the flood of online capable action titles that we've had since the last Delta Force, from which every single one of these modes came, this game just pales. It's like revisiting a piece of nostalgia looking for already mediocre gameplay that has since been duplicated and perfected by other titles that embrace the next-generation and not shy away from it.    It's not a game; it's a mission pack. The only reason Task Force Dagger is not sold as an expansion is because Land Warrior is almost two years old, and not doubt owned and regularly played by relatively few people. Of those select diehards still grasping on to the constant glimmer of voxel generated hope, a tiny fraction would invest in an expansion. Hence the standalone nature of this title. But that's not enough to sell. It's painfully clear by now that the game, and every aspect of it, is horribly antiquated -- it was even dated when Land Warrior was released. So, in comes the convenient war in Afghanistan (it could have just as easily have been Delta Force: Israel versus Palestine). Take a current event, use an old, cheap, and owned engine to easily swap in new content, and then wrap it up with pretty cardboard... Presto! Instant paycheck. Revenues for this quarter will be up; subsequently, future superior efforts will have wider births.It's not surprising then that from top to bottom, Task Force Dagger feels like a rushed ploy to sneak the green out of a hapless America. I've seen total conversions and basic mods and mutators for games that aspire to do more than this one ever dreamt of. New dirt, new guns, same game. Rehash is not synonymous with good. Even staunch Delta Force fans will be disappointed.", "date": "Jul 11, 2002"}
