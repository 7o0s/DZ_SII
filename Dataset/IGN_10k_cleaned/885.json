It's a cup in baseball right?  This year Trip Hawkins and his 3DO bullpen follow up last years' big slugger (which by the way had nothing to do with Sammy Sosa, so 2001 MUST be better right?) with a grand slam.  What is grand and what is just a slam is a fine line depending on your personal expectations of what a baseball game should be.  High Heat 2001 continues to offer something to both the hardcore stats-freak, as well as the backyard stickballer, successfully combining simulation aspects and arcade slams into a well rounded game worthy of 3DO's ~Best Baseball Game~ Guarantee...for now.  You get 6 different game modes including a full season, exhibition, batting practice, career, home-run derby and playoffs.  Season mode is where things really start to heat up.  You can play a full 162 game season or you can make a custom season with as many or as few teams as you want.  You have the option of playing a single season, or you can step up and go with career mode that allows you to continue on to the next season and build your empire.  In this mode there are 3 minor leagues, trades, injuries, team stat tracking, end of season awards and even a rookie draft.  Before you start any sort of season you should make use of the batting practice mode with which you can set what kind of pitches your batter receives.  Trust me, it's not as easy as it looks!  Now on to the gameplay.  Gone are the days of a cursor in the strike zone.  You tell the pitcher which of the 9 types of pitches you want him to throw, (each pitcher has 2-6 types of pitches he can throw) and if you want him to go for a ball or a strike.  From here on in it's up to the pitcher.  Hopefully the AI is on the same wave as you and has the skills to pull it off.  This unpredictability results in a fairly realistic number of walks and also adds some real tension to your games.  On the batting side of things you can ~guess the pitch~ that the pitcher is going to throw, and thereby increase or decrease your odds of a good, clean hit, or you can just go ahead and crank that puppy.  Timing is everything when you have ash in your hand, or at least that's what my daddy used to say.  You can adjust the angle of your bat, but as far as I could tell, there was no way to adjust your hitting power or to choose grounder/fly-ball.  Bunting is also an option, but so is just standing there and taking a ball in the bean.  Fielding is par for the course with HH 2001.  Lead-offs, pick-offs, base stealing etc...  It's nice to see some smarts in the infield these days.  I remember some games where even from 10ft the player would do a full wind-up throw.  Not here baby.  Infielders will even toss a ball behind their back to get an out.  One thing I did notice was that sometimes when a throw is made to a base, the ball doesn't always look like it connects with the glove for a catch.  This can make a close call look nowhere near an out.  Guess you just have to trust the umpires.  I've been to a few Major League games and it is an assault on the senses that no computer game could possibly hope to recreate.  High Heat tries to get the heckler/fan part down, but the sounds of the stadium come off a bit overdone and even slightly annoying at times.  The sounds of the actual game on the other hand are top notch.  The crack of the bat, the ball smacking a well oiled glove etc...all sound pretty good, as I would expect them to.  Animations of the batter leave something to be desired though.  A good follow through even on missed balls would have been nice.  If you swing the bat and blink, you might miss it you swing so fast.  Other animations such as outfielders diving for a ball or the pitcher winding up are all fairly well done.  The graphics themselves leave me wanting more as well.  The players are alright, but when I see a character in a game like Quake or some other fast-paced action game the detail is pretty astounding, so I would assume that a slower-paced game could handle more detail but the players seem fairly blocky most of the time.  There is a really pasted-on look on just about everything, but you really notice it on the stadiums themselves.  The crowd is a flat fuzzy low-res texture, while everything around it is a higher res texture and the contrast is glaring. Just don't expect to pick out the seats you were in for your last Major League outing. I guess realism and stats-tracking take first chair to graphics.  In the course of my research, I discovered that one of the new features was a raised pitcher's mound that affects ground balls.  This is a NEW feature?  Are you telling me that the all-mighty HH 2000, which is held in high regard by baseball fans as being super realistic, didn't have a mound?  Needless to say, I was floored. There are a few other bells and whistles missing from the title but you can't really fault the game for not including fistfights with the umpire and tow-headed little bat-boys running around the field.  -- Jef Shoults Despite the fact that the PC versions of High Heat Baseball have been considered among the best baseball games ever released, 3DO has failed to work that same magic on the consoles. It's really sad for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it shouldn't be too hard for them to port the game to the PlayStation with all of the important features in tact. Secondly, the PlayStation needs a really good baseball game more than it needs another 2D Castlevania. And despite the high ratings that they've been getting in most reviews, EA's TP 2001 and 989's MLB 2001 are both pretty mediocre games. The baseball scene on the PlayStation is flat out weak and Sammy Sosa High Heat 2001 doesn't do anything at all to change it.", "date": "Apr 21, 2000"}
