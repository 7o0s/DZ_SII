Instead of trying to follow up last year's 3D version of the once 2D-exclusive series, Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon, Konami has wisely decided to bring back the great sidescrolling co-op gameplay that has made the series a hit in Japan.The story this time around makes even less sense than usual. The fearsome foursome of Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke and Yae are called in to witness the Wiseman of Iga's latest invention: the super-gorgeous ghost return machine. To make a long story short, the evil nun Bisumaru steals the machine (which was invented for such benign activities as bringing deceased gorgeous superstars back to life) and uses it to resurrect Dochuki, the blue-skinned boss of the underworld. It's again up to Goemon to save the world from certain doom, not to mention a flood of smaller ghosts accidentally released by Bisumaru.GameplayGoemon's Great Adventure (released in Japan under the title: Ganbare Goemon: Deoro Dero Douchu Obake Tenkomori) is essentially a follow up to the gameplay found in Goemon 2 for the Super Famicom (which was never released in the US) with heavy Castlevania overtones. Imagine 2D sidescrolling levels that require you to jump from platform to platform, whack enemies with your character's weapon of choice, push around boxes or rocks and solve simple puzzles. There are five distinct areas in the game, from the green hills around Edo (Tokyo) Castle over ghostly underground graveyards to a flying city in the sky. The different areas are made up of five types of stages: Road/action stages, town stage, gate stage, castle stage and Impact stage.Once you finish an action stage (accessed from a Super Mario World style map), you usually gain access to at least one new stage. In the towns, players can walk around and gather hints and clues from the locals, eat food to boost their health or buy protective items that help them survive in the action stages. The basic idea is to collect wooden entry passes that secure your way into the castle stage at the end of each area. Once you're in the castle, you have to survive all kinds of obstacles and finally face a unique boss or two. Before you move on to the next area, you jump into Goemon Impact  a giant clockwork robot  and, together with his newly built female counterpart, Miss Impact, square off first-person style with Japan's most vicious mech enemies. Yes, it sounds completely nuts. Luckily, it all somehow fits together to make a highly entertaining and original game.Although the action is straightforward and doesn't require much thinking, the game has enough puzzle elements and interesting little touches to keep it interesting. For example, the first castle stage has players run through a burning building with damaged walkways, flames shooting out from holes in the floor and debris falling from the ceiling. Gameplay here is pretty much on rails, with players trying to avoid enemies and jumping over collapsing platforms. Everything looks sounds and feels Japanese. Fast-forward to another castle. Our heroes encounter medieval knights and flying witches in a much more vertical level with a European look. Squint your eyes and you could almost swear that Goemon is a Belmont. Another world has players swim underwater, smashing jars for money and defending themselves against misgiving octopi. The varied level design will keep you playing just to see what strange and weird worlds still lie ahead.Although the game is mostly linear, like many of the old 16-bit platformers, there are a few non-linear elements to make things more interesting. First of all, the path through the levels may differ slightly depending on which character you choose. For example, Goemon will learn the ability to take out certain blocks with his pipe, Yae can use a bazooka or transform into a mermaid and swim underwater (Sasuke can, too -- but he needs to find a propeller attachment first), Ebisumaru can bounce off the ground to reach higher up areas, and so on. Then there are such fun little vehicles as wooden horses, mechanic fish or robot walkers (like the ones in Final Fantasy VI) that players can ~borrow~ from their opponents and use against them. Although their powers are limited, it's cool to be able to mess around with some of the stuff that's usually limited to ~enemy use~ only. While most of these features already appeared in the old Goemon games, KCEO, the developers of Great Adventure also borrowed some elements from Castlevania, such as the day/night meter. Depending on whether it's day or night, players will encounter different monsters (ghosts come out at night, after all) in the action stages or bump into new characters in the town sequences.Since quite a few levels have more than one exit, it's sometimes necessary to go back in with a new character and try an alternate route. Additionally, some NPCs (such as Beatmania, who has a cameo) ask Goemon to complete simple tasks and bonus missions both in the town stages and in action stages they have already finished. For example, Obisumaru, an evil thief (who not surprisingly looks just like Ebisumaru) challenges you to a race through one of the stages. At other times, Goemon has to pick a certain number of mushrooms within a time limit or search the towns for the rightful owner of a specific item. These little side quests help loosen up the otherwise predictable world structure and lengthen the game's overall quest. Speaking of which  unlike most Konami games, Goemon's Great Adventure takes more than a day to finish. Don't expect a 40 hour tour-de-force a la Rare or Nintendo, but GGA is longer than both Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid  plus, you have the chance to team up with a buddy and go through the quest together.Overall, Goemon's Great Adventure is a well put-together sidescroller that will appeal not only to fans of whacked out humor and Japanimation, but also long-time Konami fans who have been clamoring for a Castlevania (2D) type game on N64. A few more RPG elements would have been nice to strengthen the town sequences (like in Goemon 3), and it's a shame Konami didn't include the many classic mini-games that could be found in Goemon 1-3 (such as Gradius, air hockey, racing and so on), but the excellent 3D fights and simple, yet enjoyable platform gameplay make this another great entry into the series.MultiplayerYou can't talk about a Goemon game without mentioning multiplayer. Konami has made up for the disappointing lack of a two-player mode in last year's game and brought back the fun co-op action from the 16-bit days. Remember the fun you had teaming up with a friend in Contra, Gun Star Heroes or the original Goemon (Mystical Ninja)? It's back. Two players not only fight side by side on the same screen, but they can carry each other around piggy-back to get through rough spots and even combine their attacks for more powerful ones. Unlike in previous installments, the 3D Impact mech fights -- a unique mix between 3D boxing and shooting -- are handled tag-team style. One player attacks, then passes a scroll to the other mech (who is waiting for his/her turn in the background) to switch positions and let the other one attack. This works like a charm not only in the two-player mode, but also the single-player mode, where the tagging becomes an important strategic element to avoid attacks. The icing on the cake is a hidden four-player mode, which you have to first unlock before you can use it.GraphicsGoemon's Great Adventure is presented in 2.5D, meaning two-dimensional gameplay with 3D backdrops. Gameplay mostly takes place on a single plane (except for the city stages, where players can move up and down as well) -- much like in Crash Bandicoot. While this means more restricted movement, it also makes for much more precise platform jumping. No longer do players have to struggle with camera angles and guess distances. Everything is in plain sight. But Konami knows that everything 2D is automatically doomed to low sales in the US and decided to render all the backgrounds in polygonal 3D to create a pseudo three-dimensional look. Unlike the flat 2D backdrops in the old Goemon games, the background scenery often rotates around the player, goes up and down and sometimes the path even splits into different routes. At times, you can even see the alternate path far in the background, letting you see items or secrets you may otherwise have missed.The levels themselves are detailed and often rendered with eye-popping colors. Some of the stages look like they jumped right out of a Kurosawa movie, complete with both Buddhist and Shinto architecture, temples, shrines, tombstones, cogs, mills, giant frogs, statues and more. Goemon and his friends are well animated and look just like they did in the SNES titles, only that they're polygonal. The enemy creatures -- most of which are based on Japanese folklore -- are less impressive, with the exception of the super-sized, often hilarious boss characters that appear at the end of the five castles as well during the 3D robot battles. Oh, and Plasma, everyone's favorite fakir makes a triumphant return, complete with the somewhat disturbing dancing onis... What's not to like?SoundGoemon's Great Adventure features pretty much the same sound effects as its 16-bit predecessors  even though they're a bit more varied and the sampling rate is higher. It's all vintage anime stuff, with lots of boings and clanks mixed in with traditional Japanese taiko drum hits and realistic environmental audio like wind, crickets or waves. The music also stays true to the series. The Goemon theme is everywhere and it's all rendered in that peculiar mix of synthesizer music and old-fashioned shamisen, koto and drum music that pervades many Japanese comedy anime shows and videogames. Then there is the Castlevania-inspired stage with a fittingly Castlevania-esque score. Cool.What about the cool sung tunes and elaborate musical numbers that the series has introduced to N64 with the last title? Bad news, folks. For whatever reason (cartridge cost, presumably), Konami has taken out the Japanese version's long songs and accompanying cutscenes and replaced them with... well, nothing. Instead of the funny intro, US owners only get a static start-up screen. Disappointing.Peripheral SupportGoemon's Great Adventure requires a Controller Pak to save (even though the Japanese version featured EEPROM back-up). The game also supports the Rumble Pak.Okay, I admit it. I'm a Goemon fan. Although I will probably pass up Konami's upcoming Goemon Sugoroku board game, Goemon's Great Adventure is a solid throwback to Konami's glorious 16-bit sidescroller days. The Goemon meets Castlevania gameplay may not present a step forward for videogames, but the game is so enjoyable that it doesn't really matter. The early stages are pretty easy, but some of the later levels require advanced platform skills and a good eye, as KCEO throws everything from collapsing platforms to giant, Goemon-crushing wheels into the fray. Sadly, the plethora of mini-games that added so much replay value to the old Goemon games is no longer, but the quirky side quests -- including a tame parody of phone sex that has Yae dispel the Japanese belly button myth (don't ask, you have to play it.) -- are still to be found. Points off for editing all the cool songs out of the US version, but Goemon's Great Adventure still emerges as Konami's best Goemon game since Goemon 2 and the translation is much more faithful than Mystical Ninja and co. A funny, addictive co-op adventure that every 2D platform game fan should add to his collection.", "date": "Oct 13, 1999"}
