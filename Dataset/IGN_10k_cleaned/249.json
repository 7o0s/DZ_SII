Although Polyphony Digital is an excellent development team for the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2, even it is capable of producing the average, throwaway title. Cool on the heels of its now-classic Gran Turismo racing game comes Omega Boost, a shooter with as much gameplay as its title has sense. Gameplay As shooters go, the premise isn't too bad. Take high-quality, low-budget live action FMV, wrap it around your standard ~AI entity goes bad so humans must travel back in time to stop it before it gets created~ storyline, throw in a giant mech with enough firepower to level the Himalayas, chop in a hard-rock soundtrack, and voila! Instant shooter justification.   Unfortunately, the shooter that gets justified is about as rudimentary as it gets. Control-wise, Polyphony's implemented a targeting system with both manual and automatic lock-on firing, which enhances the shooting aspect, but can make you feel like you're playing the Saturn's Panzer Dragoon series at best, Rebel Assault at worst. Quite a range. The designers conceded to break out of the forward-scrolling shooter with the scanning system, which enables you to move around a selected target instead of flying by. The scan system is a nifty feature with limited use, since its effectiveness deteriorates over time, which can leave you stuck facing the ground or other uncomfortable directions. Faced with linear movement in a limited range and a handicapped 3D movement system, it's possible to develop effective but boring tactics.   The level design itself is competent, but utterly predictable. For the first few levels, you'll face a few warm-up waves of easy enemies, then a swarm, then a mid-level boss, then the final boss. Later levels simply add to the numbers and types. Landscape is sparse -- the land is flat as old soda and space is remarkably asteroid-free. The only time it'll become a significant part of gameplay is in the tunnel areas. But even that is par for the course. If you've played any shooters at all, you know the drill. Frankly, if it weren't for the quirky control over your Omega Boost, it'd be possible to easily finish the game in less than an hour.  Graphics In its favor, though, the graphics aren't all that bad. Polyphony designers are obviously fans of giant robot anime, and their influence clearly permeates the setup and look of each level. The lock-on lasers have the cool starburst configuration that's so classic in these shows, and the enemies aren't above the infamous ~Macross missile attack,~ where about a million missiles fire out of one robot and shoot out all over the place before zooming in your direction. Scenes like the fifth zone's starship fleet evoke a real sense of showmanship as you weave your way through dozens of capital ships, blazing your dramatic trail of destruction. Unfortunately, those scenes are few and far between. Sound There isn't much to say about Omega Boost's sound. Like much of the game, it's completely stock. The lasers shoot like lasers, the missiles sound like missiles, and the monsters scream like monsters. It's obvious Polyphony didn't put much effort into making everything sound good. For all intents and purposes, it could've come straight out of the PlayStation developer's library and no one would know the difference.   Musically, the soundtrack's hard rock numbers are catchy, but there's usually so much going on that the music tends to recede into background noise. Once again, the only way you'd notice it is if the soundtrack suddenly vanished.If you've got that shooter itch, you might want to pass on Omega Boost. Try Einhander or R-Type 3D before you try Omega Boost. Or, if you're willing to go nostalgia tripping, get Panzer Dragoon Zwei for the Sega Saturn (that is, if you can find it). It does just about everything Omega Boost does, but much, much better.", "date": "Sep 24, 1999"}
