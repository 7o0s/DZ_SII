Each year (starting with the system's launch in 2005) has shown fans a bit more of what DS can do, even if that means a little kicking and screaming from presentation and gameplay elements.  In Madden 05 it just seemed like there wasn't much time for full touch implementation, and the game suffered from an overall lack of polish and depth of game modes.  Jump to last year for Madden 06, and again we see that while more implementation went into the gameplay scene, presentation and overall execution of all the essential elements of pocket football still just weren't quit there.  As a fan-base of portable gamers we seem trapped in the love/hate relationship for pocket simulation sports, dying for a new version for us to sink our teeth into, yet continually disappointed (even if on a very minimal scale) that the DS Madden franchise just hasn't taken off yet.  Well, even though we hate to say it, Madden 07 still just isn't there   To be fair, there are a ton of people out there that harp on year-to-year sports franchises, claiming that every year we're treated only to a roster update, and that each sequential version isn't a great enough leap forward to validate a new purchase.  Oddly enough, those same people are the ones making the Madden franchise a record-breaking game in the sales category, so feel free to figure that one out.  In Madden 07 for DS, we believe that EA truly did try to put forth a strong effort, as the sports company added a ton of new options and gameplay modes, but the execution just didn't click.   Kicking things off, Madden 07 offers a counterpart to nearly every mode you'd want to see in a console package.  Players are able to select their favorite teams, having pictures and stats of the players and home field displayed all over the two screens during pre-game, and licensed music fills the speakers during all menu navigation.  As for included game modes, the DS package offers the classic play now quick game, wireless support for up to four players (each needing their own cart), full franchise, season, tournament, custom league, and practice modes, as well as a wireless mini-camp for even more multiplayer goodness.  Top that off with a pretty deep create-a-team and create-a-play mode, and you should have a solid Madden title, right?   Not necessarily.  It seems that with every high point Madden offers this year, there are plaguing issues to counteract them.  For starters, all navigation in the main mode allows for on-screen items to be highlighted with the stylus, but not selected with it.  What is the point of having touch interface at all if you still have to divert to the buttons in order to actually ~click~ on your choices?  It's not a huge deal, but it gets really annoying to have this ~sort of touch~ feeling virtually every menu in the game.  Moving on, we take a look at the create-a-play mode.  This is an area that is simply made for DS control.  After all, who wouldn't want to select a play format, pick your receivers, and draw out their routes right on the fly with the DS touch screen?  Well, apparently EA doesn't want to, as the create-a-play requires players to use the d-pad to draw the receivers routes, even though all the action is on the bottom screen.  Amazingly infuriating.  We do have to say that the on-the-fly hot-routes and advanced defense commands are an awesome addition to the on-field gameplay, as players can literally trace out new hot-routes to break down a weak defense, but unfortunately the rest of the game doesn't embrace touch as much as it should.   So how does touch implementation work with Madden 07, you ask.  Well, it's pretty hit and miss, just like the rest of the gameplay execution.  As mentioned, hot-routes are simply amazing, and we had a blast custom-fitting our offense on nearly every play.  Also included was a fully touch mode of Madden, which has players tapping to snap, flicking the stylus to juke and spin, and even drawing up in the air to go up for an interception or diving catch.  Using the screen in tandem with the d-pad to move, it seems like a strong gameplay mechanic, but bunch a few receivers in the same passing lane and the touch control doesn't know which receiver to go to.  Rather than tapping the intended receiver, you actually draw a line from the QB in the direction of your man downfield.  Since the guy is in motion though, that receiver will often change as you draw, making what should have been an awesome control mode a total cluster of issues.   If you don't share our pain for the touch implementation in Madden yet, you will within the next dozen or so words.  As a final nail in the coffin, Madden's kicking system for the DS is actually broken, and with no way to do traditional kicks (with the power bar), players will be forced to use an extremely sub-par kicking system to attempt even the most simple kicking motions.  The design is created to have players tap a starting and ending point on the screen, and then draw a line connecting the two points to determine the power and direction (left/right) of the kick.  Instead, a correct line drawn (vertically, obviously) will often send the ball only five to ten yards forward, missing any extra point, field goal, or giving the opposition amazing field position.  The only way to boot a strong punt or kick-off is to disregard the left/right rule, and put the starting mark in the bottom left corner of the touch screen, and then draw a line to the upper right.  The game won't recognize that you're aiming for the sidelines, and instead will take the longer stylus stroke and boot the ball the correct distance.  Just sick.  Unfortunately, that doesn't work 100% of the time, and we've actually practiced for multiple hours on multiple systems and multiple review editors kicking field goals and extra points over and over again.  Our success rate?  Three successful extra points/field goals after almost two straight hours of setting up an actual scoring scenario.  And as a final ~screw you~ to the player, the practice mode actually lets you kick the length of the field just by randomly scribbling on the bottom screen.  We never thought we'd say this, but where is our little kicking meter? We want that back  In fact, aside from the horrid kicking issues (that will have people returning their games, assuming its a faulty copy), the rest of the package is actually pretty strong.  There are a ton of modes and options, lots of multiplayer, and the overall graphical and audio presentation has received a bit of a bump as well.  Its going to come down to whether or not you feel its worth the risk (and the aggregation) to track this game down and work though a few of the serious issues it will bring to the table.  The rest of the gameplay is pretty strong (aside from a few awkward passing/receiving accuracy issues that we had over our many hours of gameplay), and its really a shame that EA would take something as simple as kicking, and actually hurt the gameplay while trying to add in the touch implementation weve all been asking for.  Is it worth your cash?  We really cant say yes after seeing a few of the major design flaws.  That being said, there are still fans all across the net on game boards finding ways to work around the kicking system, and anyone who can get it down hails Madden 07 as the best DS football game yet, but theres no way we can give an honest recommendation to the game taking into account a few major flaws (kicking being one of them).  Hopefully well see a comparable version to this one in Madden 08, minus the aggravating touch screen bugs and half-assed implementation.  It really is a strong title thats brought down by a few plaguing issues.", "date": "Aug 26, 2006"}
