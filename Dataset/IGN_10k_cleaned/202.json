I've never been too fond of futuristic racers, excluding WipeOut and a couple others, and if you've played games like Cosmic Race, Streak, even Jet Moto 2, you may have the same opinion about these extreme racing games as I do. However, after playing Jet Moto 3, man, I honestly have not put the controller down since I turned it on, and from here on out, I'll give the futuristic racing genre a chance.   Gameplay The physics engine has been improved so much in this game when compared to Jet Moto 2. The bikes handle so much better than before. Whether I'm cruising around a corner, or going off a jump, no matter what the track situation, I didn't find myself as disoriented landing some absurd stunt as I did in last year's run. That alone is a huge plus.  Which brings me to the tracks themselves. Each track is littered with all sorts of jumps, hills, twists and turns, and although it didn't really matter what surface you raced on, because it didn't seem to have any effect on the bike's handling, every course was still different, fun and exciting to race through. One of my personal favorites would have to be the Khumbu Ice Falls. When flying through this course, man, you've got to keep your eyes peeled. One second, you're racing through an ice cave, the next, you're falling to your death, exceeding speeds of 150 mph -- watch for hidden crevices.  There are also a ton of different play modes as well. Gamers can choose to test their Moto skills in either Practice, Single Race, Circuit or Season Mode. Difficulty settings can be adjusted also.  Graphics Graphically, Jet Moto 3 looks so much better than JM 2. Way better. I mean, the tracks alone: they're more detailed and look sweet. The courses are set in all sorts of environments including canyons, volcanic islands, lost cities, and again, look amazing. Oh, and the framerate, it's so much better than the last Jet Moto go-around. There's hardly any slow down, popup is minimal, man, the game looks and moves so much better than the first two Jet Moto games (it's obvious that I'm still not getting over how much better JM 3 than JM 2) -- I guess the third time is a charm.  I think the character design is still crud, though. I can't believe they kept the sponsors in. I hate Mountain Dew (The Max) and I hate Slim Jims (Convict), but those are the two bikes I dig the most.  I don't know, I think using sponsors is cheesy. However, the bikes themselves look damn cool. There are 11 bikes to choose from and all have possess different their own unique handling attributes.  One other small complaint in the graphics department, the game could've used a few more visual effects. Hey, maybe I'm being a little too picky, but if you look past the sparks that come off your bike and the speed of the game, nothing much else is going on. Other than that, the game looks great -- it's the best looking Jet Moto game, yet.   Sound You can't help but to notice the loud engine rumbles right when the race begins. It's a tad annoying, but nothing that your ears couldn't handle or get used to. The crashing-against-walls noises and the colliding-into-other-bikes sounds are also nice as well. In fact, you can't help but to cringe sometimes when you hit a wall, or another bike smacks into you. ~Now way, my bike?!~ Pardon the Kaneda reference.  Jet Moto 3 does however have some great music, my goodness. I swear, half the time I thought I was in a rave and I was suppose to be poppin' E, or something... not that E is good for you, or they do that sort of thing at raves, that's just what I hear, like, on the news, and in books. Seriously, the music tracks in this game just thump and totally rock. I'll be honest, while I was writing this review, I was listening to the menu select screen music. It's bad-ass. I can't get over it. Jet Moto 2 was such a horrible game, and when I popped this in, all I could say is, ~Wow.~ To simply put it, if you're a Jet Moto nut, and you felt cheated because Jet Moto 2 was so nasty, then prepare to be redeemed. Jet Moto 3 looks, plays, and feels so much better -- you'll be happy with it. Even if you've never played a Jet Moto game, number 3 is the best of the bunch, and if you enjoy futuristic racing games, Jet Moto 3 will be a nice enhancement to that part of your videogame library.", "date": "Sep 4, 1999"}
