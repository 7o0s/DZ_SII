They do nearly everything right to bring the crime fighting cheerleader to life and are just damn fun to play. That said, the first A2M developed Kim Possible game on the DS was a mediocre bore. Now, almost two years later, the peppy Middleton overachiever is back in an all new game: Disney's Kim Possible: Global Gemini. While it may not be as polished and well designed as its GBA predecessors, this new KP is a leapkick in the right direction.    This time around, Team Possible has to stop the diabolical plans of Gemini, the mastermind behind the Worldwide Evil Empire. Gemini, along with fellow villains Motor Ed and Adrena Lynn, have brainwashed members of Global Justice, and only a teenager, her friend, and his pet naked mole rat can save the world (Funny how that always seems to happen). Fans of the series will likely recognize the main villains in the game, though they are slightly more obscure than say, Drakken or Shego. The game is broken up into episodic chunks, the story being told through the obligatory character cutouts and word bubbles. There aren't a lot of different images for the characters, but the writing is actually somewhat decent. There's a decent amount of humor in there, and it all feels like it could have been taken directly from the show.    The look and feel of the show is carried over nicely. Though the character models aren't spectacularly sharp, they make up for it in their fluidity of movement. Kim does everything with flair and style. In contrast Ron ambles along awkwardly, accurately portraying the bumbling sidekick in all his clumsy glory. The world the characters inhabit is well detailed. Each level is expansive, and despite the characters being on rails and thus limited in movement, the environment is still deep and rich.    Of course, the levels are only if players can interact with them, and that's where Kim's gadgets come in. A staple of the series, KP's handy gizmos will save her from many a tight spot. Fortunately, every gadget in the game is actually useful, and players will find themselves switching between them on a regular basis. A2M has thankfully ditched the token system so players don't have to buy the new toys. Instead, each item is automatically unlocked as the game progresses. With the inclusion of Ron Stoppable, the amount of cool items is doubled. Ron has his own set of gadgets to help compensate for his lack of physical prowess. As a result, both types of levels play differently, and yet they both feel very much the same, so the flow of the game is never broken up.       Still, Global Gemini still has a few of the same mistakes that Kimmunicator had. For instance, the DS features, like the touch screen are hardly used. Besides tapping the lower screen to select Kim or Ron's equipped item, the only other time players use the screen is in the two vehicle levels. A touch screen controlled snowboarding and moped level serve as final showdowns for two of the bosses. While mildly interesting, the levels are short and ultimately forgettable. Both can be played in a slightly more fun versus version with the games multicard two player mode though, so friends that both have the game may get a kick out of racing each other.    Besides the lack of DS specific features, A2M has once again made their game far too easy, even for a kid's game. Henchmen and ninjas rarely even try to attack players, and health powerups are so plentiful, it's almost impossible to die. Likewise, the ability to earn extra lives is fairly simple too, so it's not hard to rack up a dozen extra lives before the game is halfway done. There is a more difficult version of the game that does offer a bit more challenge - mostly in the way of smarter enemy AI - but players have to beat the game on easy to unlock it.   It's almost hard to believe that this is the fifth Kim Possible game to hit a Nintendo handheld in the last seven years. For a kids show license, that's really saying something. Players should probably feel grateful that A2M doesnt stick to the same old formula with each game, but rather tries to change it up and make the games fresh each time. This may not be the best Kim Possible game, but it certainly isnt the worst. There's plenty to do in this one, and the useful gadgets alone make it stand out from the last Kim Possible game. Still, Global Gemini could have benefited from some more touch screen (or maybe even microphone) features, and that hard mode should have been available from the start. Kim Possible: Global Gemini is fun, but for players that never picked up a KP game, go snag the last two GBA ones first.", "date": "Mar 6, 2007"}
