Broken into nine parts, Bone is a work of singular visual and has earned critical acclaim for its imaginative world of fantasy. Telltale Games snatched up the license to the now-completed series, determined to recreate the fascinating fantasy world that held comics readers spellbound for years. In many ways Telltale succeeded in capturing the essence of the comics, but the demands of a sophisticated PC community leaves Bone: Out from Boneville, the first of several  Bone games, lacking in polish, depth and great gameplay.  Out from Boneville follows the series through the first of nine chapters, creating just a tease at the overall story and leaving some of the best elements of Bone for the future. Things begin when cousins Fone Bone, Phoney Bone and Smiley Bone find themselves lost in the desert, far from home. They've been chased from Boneville, following one of Phoney's money-grubbing schemes. Lost and without a clue as to how to get home, the three stumble upon a strange valley filled with talking bugs, a laid back dragon and a beautiful girl with a dark secret.  The three Bones are quite unique, with Fone playing the romantic, Phoney as the Scrooge McDuck-type money monger and Smiley acting the part of idiot savant -- or perhaps just idiot. Each is perfectly translated from the comics. The voices fit, much of the dialogue comes straight from the comics and the humor and sense wonder provide a solid foundation for the bigger adventure to come in later chapters.  Designed wisely as a point-and-click adventure, Telltale makes a few glaring omissions. The environments are typically small, which is nothing new to fans of adventures games from way back when. But even the earliest PC adventure games offered interesting interactions with much of the environment. In Bone, it's what you click is what you need to progress the game. There's no need to wander, because there is rarely anything to see beyond the main story. And considering that tale will only take about three hours to complete, even the inexpensive $20 price tag seems a little much. This is especially true if you consider that this game is only available through digital delivery, meaning Telltale isn't losing a big chunk of money to a retailer.  Pointing and clicking is not such a bad thing and actually suits the story quite well. It's just that it's all just to service this short story. To its credit, Telltale including lots of funny bits of dialogue that go beyond the comics while maintaining the integrity of the characters. The game plays more like an interactive storybook than a true adventure game. It will tickle kids, for certain, but will likely leave sophisticated gamers wanting a bit more depth.    Telltale makes one major flaw and it comes with the only skill-based element in ll of Bone. There are several minigames sprinkled throughout, most too simple for all but the youngest audience. I was one of the few kids who had a PC when I was growing up. I played games like Zork and (when my parents were at work) Leisure Suit Larry. Kids are a lot more sophisticated as gamers than most developers give them credit for.   The chase scenes hurt the overall experience. Allowing only for mouse control (with no adjustments allowed for mouse sensitivity), players must move Fone Bone left and right across the screen, jumping over the same set of objects again and again. It goes on and on and on and on. It would have been better just to offer a run at Moon Patrol for a few minutes instead of forcing the unimaginative scrolling race. It's a disservice to the story and the fun characters to have such a weak and frankly haphazard element thrown into the mix.  Bone isn't mean to wow with visuals and it doesn't. The characters are accurate, though perhaps a little raw. The textures and color lack pop, which take away that sense of a comic-book come to life. Fortunately, the voice-acting is quite good and with a great focus on dialogue, the story really comes to life whenever you open a new dialogue tree. Bone: Out from Bonevill has some great presentation, considering it is a budget title. The point-and-click style is a perfect fit for the story, but the execution is a bit flawed. Fans of the comic will get a kick out of seeing Bone come to life, but having to wait at least four months for the next chapter of a very long tale could prove frustrating. No price-point has been set yet for the upcoming additions, but if they can come in a bit cheaper with some greater attention to the gameplay, Bone could turn into a worthwhile series. You're probably better off just waiting for now. It isn't like you won't be able to get the first chapter next year. It just doesn't seem worth the wait for part two.", "date": "Oct 3, 2005"}
