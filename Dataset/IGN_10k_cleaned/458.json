First Rayman 2: The Great Escape, one of Nintendo 64's best platformers to date, and now Rocket: Robot on Wheels, the potential ~sleeper~ N64 hit of the year. Both games offer truly remarkable playing experiences, and yet they're both different enough to warrant separate purchases. What's unfortunate is that amidst all of the hype for Rayman 2, Rocket may fall between the lines unnoticed, and that would truly be a shame for this is one of Nintendo 64's most original, intuitive games to date.  The Facts  Realistic physics engine serves as main focus of gaming mechanics. Seven huge worlds (with several sub-levels and mini-games each). Seven different vehicles must be utilized to accomplish various challenges. Main character acquires new skills and items as the adventure unfolds. Unique, clever puzzles challenge gamers to work hand-in-hand with the game's ingenious physics engine. Single-player adventure. EEPROM built in save feature. Rumble Pak support.   Story The world's greatest amusement park, Whoopie World, is preparing to open to the public the next morning when everything goes awry. Park mascot Jojo the Raccoon, hungry for power (and probably rabid), goes completely insane and takes over the area. Now it's up to Rocket, a lowly maintenance robot, to set things straight.  Gameplay When first-time Nintendo 64 developer Sucker Punch started in to create Rocket, it wanted to deliver a final product in which the main character was secondary to the environments interacted with. And this is exactly what it has done. Rocket, which the company describes as ~Bugs Bunny meets Isaac Newton,~ is a game that teeters on the edge of the platform genre with some very recognizable, if not formulaic mechanics. But it's also a piece of software that innovates with difficult puzzles that go hand-in-hand with a stunning physics engine, a perfectly balanced progression of levels and so much to do that it's almost overwhelming -- that is, if it all weren't so much fun.  The game itself seems very simplistic at first. Rocket must travel through various worlds collecting tickets that have been scattered around the amusement park, which open up new areas. He must also collect tokens that unlock new abilities and tickets, as well as machine parts, which activate numerous contraptions located throughout the game. Using a handy energy grapple beam, Rocket can pick up just about any object. Once players have an object in their beam, they can meticulously plan where they want to throw it, set it down, or use it. A throwing marker even pops up that illustrates exactly where each object will land once it is thrown. This works wonderfully, playing an integral part in the adventure. But this general description of things to do hardly serves the game justice as there is so much more.  Each of the game's seven worlds features several sub-levels, mini-games and challenges. There are vehicles that must be utilized properly with environments. There are objects that must be combined with other objects for a specific effect. There are tricky puzzles that need solving. There are machines that must be built and then conquered. And all of this is held together with a philosophy that positions environments -- not Rocket -- as the primary focus of the game.  In the first level Rocket comes to an area where a machine sits quietly. It doesn't appear to be working correctly. Upon careful examination, we notice that four screws are missing from the base of the machine. Upon more exploration, we find these screws -- represented as living characters -- hopping madly about the level. The idea is to retrieve all four screws from various points in the stage and bring them back to the base of the machine. Once there, they will unlock the machine's powers and Rocket will be able to not only build, but ride his very own rollercoaster -- which, in turn, presents a unique problem of its own.  In another level, our hero cannot gain access to a gate, which houses a ticket just beyond. An armed guard prevents him from passing, explaining that only members of royal color may enter. Examining the level, we notice several pools of different colored paints. Upon jumping into them, Rocket will change color. Here, the idea is to jump in the right combination of colors in order to pass as royalty and then enter the gate.   The puzzles are subtle and much more difficult than what you're likely to find in your standard platformer. They're also extremely refreshing. They're challenging, but not ridiculous; they work in a completely logical fashion and once you've solved one, you're going to slap your forehead and say, ~I can't believe I didn't think of that sooner.~  The physics engine, meanwhile, which we can't rave enough about, is one of the most amazing technical achievements in a Nintendo 64 game to date. Every object in the title has its very own, extraordinarily realistic weight and feel. Sucker Punch, taking full advantage of this fact, has designed objects to work in conjunction with one another in a puzzle-esque manner. So, for example, whereas Rocket is too heavy to float in water, a sheep does just that. Therefore, the robot could, perhaps, drag a sheep underwater to a desired location, and then let go of the animal, watching it float to the top and straight into a switch above.  The physics engine is so detailed that it's possible take a round object, position it at the top of a hill and then let go, only to see it roll down while gaining in speed. Or, as one final example, Rocket could jump onto ice blocks, which are affected by not only Rocket's weight, but also the current of the water that they rest in and a balance must be struck between the two.  While Rocket is capable of executing a number of different moves (and riding in vehicles), it should be noted that the action is not terribly fast paced. This is why we say that the game, perhaps, isn't so much a platformer as it is a puzzler. Enemies are scarce and the speed of the title is deliberately slow. It's all about exploration, experimentation and careful solutions to the challenges presented. This is not a run and jump piece of software.   A helpful hint: Remember to press the Start button throughout the adventure for tips on what to do. Rocket is such a deep game that you're bound to miss something along the way. This is an excellent way to keep track of what tickets you do and don't have -- and where to find them.  Graphics Rocket's graphic caliber isn't quite as impressive as Rare's Banjo-Kazooie, but it's certainly pretty all the same. The game features an off-the-wall combination of 1920s-like amusement park environments, delightfully rich, colorful textures (in some levels, and just the opposite in others) and simplistic polygon models. The framerate is generally very smooth and the detail level, admittedly not as striking as Rayman 2, is very impressive. Developer Sucker Punch has sometimes sacrificed background detail for raw fluidity, which is admirable. The fade-in of backgrounds is not so bothersome, especially when compared to the alternative: a poor framerate.   Considering that this game is a first-time effort from the Seattle-based development studio, though, it's doubly impressive. Rocket does not look like a first-generation title. There are no blurry textures. There is no fogging. The game does not stutter. In fact, it's damn near close to Banjo-Kazooie in terms of graphic finesse and that's an achievement in itself.  Sound D'oh! Remember the cartoon show Peanuts? Rocket sounds like it. There is no other way to describe the sometimes jazzy, sometimes organy, always distracting music in the game. We're not very fond of it -- and there is no way to turn it down or off while playing. It's not so annoying that you'll be forced to pull out your hair and curse Sucker Punch for watching too much Charlie Brown, but after a few hours of repeating organs you're bound to get a little uneasy -- especially if you're having trouble solving a puzzle.  The sound effects, on the other hand, are executed well enough. They're cute, happy, and very platformer standard. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary here and that's okay. It works fine. You've read through my entire review now and you're probably wondering which game I prefer: Rayman 2 or Rocket. The simple answer, unfortunately, is that I cannot recommend one over the other. They're both ingenious games. What you should know is that Rocket is easily one of Nintendo 64's most innovative, original, deep, and utterly brilliant ~platformers~ to date. It's a game that is clever in a way that so many games aren't. It's a game that challenges players with a seemingly never-ending variety of unique, satisfying puzzles and mini-adventures. And wow, what a physics engine! -- You've really got to see it in action to believe it.I'm worried that despite all of this, Rocket is going to go unrecognized. That would be a true shame for this is one of Nintendo 64's very best -- not just as a platformer, or puzzler, or whatever you want to call it -- but as a piece of software. It's an outstanding title that should not be skipped over simply because it hasn't been popularized as a ~big~ holiday title. Bottom line, if you consider yourself a true, old-school gamer, you must own Rocket: Robot on Wheels.And Nintendo, make sure Sucker Punch is developing games for your next-generation hardware.Check out the official Rocket website for more information by clicking right here.", "date": "Nov 25, 1999"}
