Everyone, that is, aside from the poor saps that end up getting Mini Desktop Racing in their stocking this holiday season.  The game is brought to Wii by Conspiracy Entertainment and Dada Design Interactive, the same people that also released such budget titles as Ninja Bread Man and the aforementioned Offroad Extreme.  Normally we'd discourage speaking in generalizations, but at least for the time being it's obvious that the companies are out to make a quick buck, and their products should be avoided like the gaming plague, as it's nothing but shovelware.  Exciting stuff...  It takes about five seconds to tell exactly what happened with both Offroad Extreme and Mini Desktop Racing; two games, one amazingly simple  and broken  interface and design.  Just like Offroad Extreme, Mini Desktop Racing uses the same small icons, the same shoddy IR cursor control, and even makes up the interface with the same load bars and bland text; they're nearly identical next to each other.  Both games run in only 4:3 and 480i as well, so just like Offroad you'll be stuck with the lowest of the low display quality with Mini Desktop Racing.   If there was an A and B team working on these two games, however, Mini got the A team; though that hardly justifies bragging rights.  In general the game controls better, but it's still one hell of a frustrating experience, as you'll hold the Wii-mote facing forward, and tilt the long way as if playing Wing Island.  Why they opted to tilt the long way rather than playing like 100% of the other racers on the system is beyond us, but it's pretty uncomfortable and needlessly odd to say the least.  The game's credits mention no game designer at all though, so that explains a lot.  That being said, at least it's ~less broken~ than Offroad, which is a small step in the right direction.  Mini Desktop Racing is another shovelware title that simply needs to be ignored at all costs.  Its better than its partner in crime, Offroad Extreme, but only by a hair, as the racers controls are still extremely uncomfortable, pretty unresponsive, and completely lackluster.  Mini-games in Wario Ware, Wii Play, or EAs Wii Playground run circles around this game, and offer a ton of other modes on top of basic slot car racing.  Minis visuals are a joke, and if this game was available on Wii Ware rather than on physical media wed still recommend it for absolutely nobody, as its nothing short of insulting.  The back of Minis box labels this game as A perfect combination of miniature Mini mayhem and madcap multiplayer madness.  Wed say that alone doesnt do the game justice though, as it also Musters magnificent malignant migraines and manages to make marvelous must-play moto-racing for masochists with moronic monetary management.  The fact that Nintendo even puts its official seal on this game is nothing short of laughable.", "date": "Dec 10, 2007"}
