{"name": "Gunpey EX", "name_review": "Gunpey EX", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/06/29/gunpey-ex", "text": "Gunpey EX is a brand new puzzle game for America, but this electric-themed livewire has long been a hit in its native Japan. The game is even named after the creator of the Game Boy, Gumpei Yokoi, who was also instrumental in the development of Bandai's WonderSwan. Gunpey, the first game ever released for the WonderSwam, was eventually updated to color as Gunpey EX for the Wonderswan Color -- which brings us now to the mobile edition of this wonderfully quirky puzzle game.   Gunpey EX presents you with a grid-based well. Small lines (or wires) appear in the squares from the bottom of the well, working their way up the screen. If a single line touches the top of the well, the game ends. To clear a stage, you must create lines that link one side of the well to the other by shuffling the wires up and down the columns in the well (there are no horizontal movements). Manage to create a line, and the pieces sizzle with electric current and disappear.   This sounds easy at first -- and it is. At first. However, several stages into the game, the screen fills up with pieces quicker, sometimes denying you wires in certain columns until it's almost too late. You can accelerate the rate of wires appearing in the well with the 0 key. You earn bonus points if you can branch off the main wire that connect the two sides, using extra pieces to make multiple contacts. If you manage to clear the screen, you can also score a pretty big bonus.   The game gets especially frantic after about ten or so levels, and by then, you're hooked. There's a reason this game sold so well in Japan -- it's a lot of fun, and it feels fresh compared to many of the puzzlers we've been playing lately for mobile or casual PC games (lots of me-too games out there now). It's too bad this game hasn't made it out here in America until now, but here's hoping it sees some serious play on as many screens as possible.   Gunpey EX is a simple-looking game, with bright colored wires that stand out in the black well. The backdrops are bright and colorful, too, to offset the austere well. The action is flanked by a pleasing little jingle that I never once wanted to turn off -- and that's a pretty rare occurrence.  Gunpey EX is a fresh, fun puzzler that is perfect for mobile. Kudos to Bandai for singling this game out and giving it a try in this market -- I hope it's a real seller, because original puzzlers really deserve notice and reward with so many imitations floating around the decks. If you like puzzle games like Tetris and Bust-a-Move, you shouldn't hesitate with Gunpey EX. Trust me, had I known about this game sooner, I would have imported a Wonderswan just to play it.", "date": "Jun 29, 2006"}
