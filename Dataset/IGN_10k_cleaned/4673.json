A bestseller on the GameCube, the action/puzzle game was also a smash when SEGA released a 2-D version on Sprint PCS phones last year. Now, the simian superstars are back in a to-go portion of the console Monkey Ball's mini-game, bowling.   Features:   Four characters  Two gameplay modes  High score board   Monkey Ball Bowling is actually one of the better bowling games we've played on our handsets. And not just because we like the monkeys. It's just a well-done simulation of the sport that offers solid control of the ball. And the monkey stuff doesn't hurt, either.   Start off the action by selecting a monkey avatar from the game's cast: AiAi, MeeMee, GonGon, and Baby. Later in the game, the monkey's mug appears in the upper left corner the screen -- so this isn't the last time you see your monkey.   From there, jump right on to the lane and start rolling. Once you choose your position on the lane, there are three meters to adjust prior to your roll. First, you must direct the ball with a bright red line. Do you aim straight for the ten pin? Then, the power meter on the right fills and ebbs. Finally, you can put a little english on the ball with a curled meter on the right side of the screen.   Once you manipulate all of those meters and gee-gaws, your monkey goes flying down the lane. Hopefully, you managed to pull everything off and you score a strike. Blow it on the curve, and you'll drown in the gutter. Poor monkey in the gutter. We told him not to mess with the Jesus.   There are two types of games in Monkey Ball Bowling: Standard and Challenge. Standard is just a regular ten frame match. Challnege, however, offers off ten different pin patterns and gives you only twelve tries to flatten them all. Needless to say, it is indeed a challenge. But it's one worth sticking with, because the pin patterns are devilishly fun.   Monkey Ball Bowling looks decent enough. Not exactly flashy, but then again, we don't really expect flashy from SEGA Mobile anymore. Sigh. The monkeys look fine, the fairy tale castle lane is detailed, and the meters are easily readable. That's all you really need for a bowling game, right?Monkey Ball Bowling is a very well-made bowling game -- it just isn't a terribly flashy one, even with the cool Monkey Ball license. The Challenge mode is a really slick addition that I ended up spending more time with than regular bowling, and I suspect you will, too. Sure the regular game is good, but chances are, you've played video game bowling to death by now. (Hasn't everybody played JAMDAT Bowling yet?)", "date": "Apr 28, 2004"}
