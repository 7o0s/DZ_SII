I mean, NBA Shoot Out 98 has so many new and innovative features, I honestly don't know where to begin.   In addition to having all 29 NBA teams with up-to-date rosters, Sony has managed to successfully pack in all the on court action you'd expect to see in a real primetime game including spin moves, pump fakes, cherry picking, give and gos, behind the back passes, and my favorite, tons and tons of dunks.  Now I am dunk bitch, I love dunks, so you're going to have to pardon the raving and ranting on how cool the new Total Control Dunking feature in this year's ShootOut. Check this out, when you go up to dunk, you can actually choose which dunk you want to do... in mid-air. Imagine going up the lane to deliver a two-handed jam, got that picture in your head? Now, you're going up, oh, but wait, Hakeem jumps from the baseline and tries to block your cram -- what to do? In most basketball games, your shot would be blocked, but in ShootOut 98, right when you take off, you can change that planned two-handed jam into a reverse dunk. And if no one was there, rather than a two-handed dunk, you can show off a do a 360 degree dip! Oh yeah!   Unfortunately, there are some flaws that should be addressed. For example, swatting and stealing the ball from an offensive opponent is way too easy. It was cool at first, I mean, 25 steals and 15 blocks in one game, that's pretty impressive. But it was like playing Konami's In the Zone all over again -- whoever had the most steals and fastbreaks, wins. Yes, you can up the foul option, but then the game really starts to drag. There are so many positive highlights, though, that you'll forget about stealing the ball all the time and you'll want to try other ways to rack up points -- I recommend alley-ooping to Shawn Kemp.  Overall, this is a great basketball game that will please most, if not all, basketball enthusiasts.  Jay Boor", "date": "Mar 12, 1998"}
