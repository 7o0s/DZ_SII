They ranged from quirky and addictive (SimAnt) to downright awful (SimLife) and quite a few in between. One of the better ones was a skyscraper management game called SimTower. Over a decade later Sega has published the game as The Tower SP, a port of the classic computer title for the Game Boy Advance. While it seems a bit dated, The Tower SP offers some solid gameplay for fans of micromanagement.   The premise of The Tower is simple. You manage and build a skyscraper from the ground up, overseeing all the details involved. Like most simulation games, The Tower is open ended so the game never truly finishes. Goals are set up for you to accomplish, mostly relating to the population of the building. By meeting these goals the building earns stars and eventually reaches tower status. Each star rating unlocks more options to help your building become a towering tribute to modern engineering.   Managing the building requires knowledge of the plethora of options you have. The game starts off with a ridiculously long tutorial, going over every aspect of the game. We found our patience wearing thin, since there's a lot of reading involved. Still, it's very helpful, since all the information is necessary. The first time you place a specific object, you will be reminded of its function and requirements. The refreshers are nice because it's doubtful anyone will be able to retain all the tutorial instructions.   The Tower manages to work surprisingly well as a handheld. The options are laid out in menus that are easily accessed by a press of the right shoulder button. Navigating through the building is simple, and the pause feature allows you to see the satisfaction level of the various offices and businesses.   There are a lot of tasks to keep track of in this monolith. Offices, condos, and hotel rooms can all be placed and rented out. Cleaning crews and security are necessary to help keep the building tidy and safe. Restaurants, shops, movie theaters, fast food, restrooms parking garages, saunas, elevators, escalators, stairs, vending machines and even spas are all at your disposal to make your building a skyscraper bustling with activity. Everything costs money though, so the expansion is slow. You'll have to build enough rentable property to earn income, while balancing the maintenance costs.   The game is actually really easy. Obtaining more income than expense is simple and so you will have no problem earning a profit from your investments. The majority of the game is spent be waiting to earn enough money to build more floors. Vivarium has included a fast forward feature, and we found that very useful for speeding along.    For added interactivity, you will often receive visitors to the building. These VIPs will rate their stay and if they enjoy their time there, will give the building a recommendation. Announcements for these visitors stop the gameplay, forcing you to sit there and watch the game. That's just enough interaction to make it annoying instead of fun. We would have rather walked away and seen a movie, while letting our building rake in the money by itself. While waiting for that, there are a few things you can do. Restrooms need cleaning after all, and since the cleaning crew only gets to them on weekends, it's up to the manager to mop up those spills. By rapidly tapping the A button over dirty bathrooms, you can give them a good scrubbing. This rapid tap feature can also be used to help lure customers to fast food places, as well as pump water for the spas. None of this is actually necessary to play them game, but it offers something to do when you're sitting there watching everything happen by itself.   The challenge comes when you are nearing the building limits. Many objects, like restrooms, cleaning crews, and elevators have a limited number that can be placed. This means that planning ahead is essential, and you may find yourself demolishing certain sections of your skyscraper so that you can adjust the placement of essentials.   The graphics for The Tower are more low-rise than high-rise. The graphics are dated, but they do their job nicely. With the variety of different rooms, it's important to be able to distinguish between them all. Thankfully, it's very easy although the building is almost always busy, and people (granted stick figures) will be bustling about. Hundreds of tiny people move about the screen, and yet the game doesn't become cluttered or hard to operate. The simple style doesn't push the limits of the GBA by any means, but it is very effective.   The music in the game is almost nonexistent, and what is there is forgettable. There are some church bells and the title screen music, but that's basically it. There are a few sound effects in The Tower. Quite a few things do make a sound, and, much like a real building, can get pretty noisy. The fun sound effects are fun similar to SimTower's. What's weird is that even on fast forward, all the sound effects occur. While waiting for your money to build up, you will be assaulted by a barrage of footsteps, mumbled conversations, cha-chings, and toilet flushes. The cacophony can get tiresome, making The Tower one of those games that is better muted.  Not everyone will find The Tower SP elevating. Fans of the simulation games are going to enjoy it for its simple, but well balanced, gameplay. However people looking for more action, or better graphics, are likely to be disappointed. Forget about getting it as a gift for your ADHD child either, since The Tower requires a lot of patience to play. The Tower is easy to operate, even if it does get boring at some points. Still the game is fun for a while, and works surprisingly well on the GBA. For people that are looking for a trip down nostalgia lane, The Tower SP is probably right up their alley.", "date": "Jul 6, 2006"}
