{"name": "Lethal Skies: Elite Pilot -- Team SW", "name_review": "Lethal Skies", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/12/lethal-skies", "text": "Legendary pilot Chuck Yeager once came up with an interesting analogy to describe a confrontation between his P-51 Mustang, the prop-driven workhorse of WWII and Korea, and an Me-262, the ground-breaking German jet fighter.  He described it as ~like a fat man running up a hill to catch a trolley.~  The analogy applies in other situations.  For example, in this particular case, Asmik Ace is the fat man, and Namco is the trolley.  Lethal Skies is what you would get if Ace Combat 4 were almost as good-looking and about one-third to one-half as much fun to play.  Admittedly, that's still saying something, since Ace Combat looks very good and is a great fun to play, but its existence nevertheless obviates most of the usefulness of any competitor that doesn't do anything very different.  Lethal Skies does not do anything very different.  It's nowhere near as bad as the Air Force Delta games, which set some kind of low-water mark in the air combat genre, but there's just not enough innovation as far as control, weaponry, or mission design to make it stand out against superior competition.    Gameplay  This is by no means anything other than an arcade-styled flight combat game, although it has the occasional simulation pretension.  It offers distinct rudder and aileron control, for example, although the rudder control is so sluggish as to be of minimal use.  That's a general malady, actually, and there seems to be no happy medium in the control options to correct it.  The three responsiveness settings for the controls as a whole (rudders, yoke, everything) are Slow, Normal, and Quick, but none of them feels quite right.  Normal is too slow, Quick is too squirrelly in comparison (particularly with a nimble fighter like the F-16), and if Normal is too slow for my tastes, well, there goes Slow.    Lethal Skies does do some specific things right, particularly as far as skewing things in a more simulation-oriented direction.  Unlike AC or AFD, it uses realistic weapon loadouts -- none of the planes are equipped with some kind of portable hole filled with 75 missiles.  For targeting those, there's a variable autotargeting system that distinguishes between air and surface targets, plus a nice little picture-in-picture inset window to display the target in real time.  Launching a missile switches the display in that window to a first-person view from the nose of the weapon, for one of those fun CNN-highlight explosions.  The options menu also includes a neat filter effect to display the effects of G-LOC.  Turn it on and the screen goes dark or reddish in hard turns and other harsh maneuvers.  Small things like this don't do so much to make up for the game's larger flaws, though, and the interface also gets as many details wrong as it does right.  The auto-targeting system, for example, has some very annoying glitches.  On occasion, it will automatically select a ground target that's stuck behind a building, even if there's a wide-open target available at closer range.  It also won't highlight a target if you don't have a secondary weapon that can hit it.  This doesn't sound so bad until you land in a few particular situations.  Later in the game, large enemies appear that are composed of multiple targets, which must be destroyed in sequence.  The target highlighting helps indicate exactly what part of the target to kill...but how do you tell when you're out of air-to-surface missiles?  The game refuses to highlight a target when all you have left is your machinegun, which makes it almost impossible to pick out some shielded ground targets.  Perhaps most irksome of the small points is a strange double standard for gun targeting.  Hitting ground targets with your machinegun is perfectly ordinary -- you draw a bead on the target and shoot at it.  If you hit it, well, you hit it.  With air targets, though, there's an assist.  You just have to aim in the general direction of a target to take it down with guns.  This makes it very, very easy to kill enemy fighters at short range, obviating a lot of the challenge of dogfighting, and it feels awfully silly to kill a target you obviously didn't hit.    And then there's the largest issue, which is the mission design.  You could in fact perhaps tie this to the note previous about Lethal Skies' attempt to more realistically constrain the player's supply of weapons.  That's all well and good if you want to make a sim, but a sim this is not -- it's just an arcade game that happens to be a little more faithful than most.  Ace Combat uses its detachment from reality to make a more entertaining game.  You wouldn't be able to enjoy those massive beachhead assaults and city defense missions if you only had eight missiles.  Thus limited, Lethal Skies' missions revolve around strike missions against unresponsive targets, escorts with uninvolved friendlies, and yes, that old standby, the Firefox canyon mission.  Somebody needs to realize at this point that the whole fly-through-the-canyons concept is simply ripe for parody.  Graphics  The aircraft look quite good, but everything else is somewhat less so.  To focus on the game's strong points for the nonce, it features a broad variety of modern fighting jets, realistically modeled even from a close-in view, and with weaponry modeled in real time, so missiles drop off the wings, rockets kick back a blast of exhaust from the fuselage pods, and antimissile countermeasures pop out with a little flash and accompanying particle effect (although you can only spot that in a replay or from certain third-person camera angles).  There's some similarly nice modeling work done for the more futuristic enemy targets, including a neat four-legged walking tank with several independently destructible targets located about it.  The stage backgrounds, however, don't look like much.  The artists obviously had some fun playing with the game's near-future setting, resulting in a flooded New York, a wasted desert Paris, and a couple of other post-apocalyptic concepts, but there are few if any examples of particularly inspired modeling or texturing.  Paris isn't even recognizable as such unless you can pick the Arc d'Triomphe out from among all the other small boxes sprouting out of the ground.  Ditto Tokyo, although you can mistake that for Paris if you misidentify Tokyo Tower.  Nowhere does the scale of the environments come anywhere near that of Ace Combat's massive battle theaters.  Sound  Lethal Skies may be using the same ambient techno track to accompany every mission.  I'm not entirely sure.  In practical terms, however, the tracks are sufficiently similar that my ear can't notice much distinction, and as such it probably wasn't worth the bother if the developers did record more than just the one.  Somebody needs to realize that what this genre requires is a potent dose of full-on BUTT ROCK~!  Yu Suzuki knows this, which makes the temporary disappearance of Propeller Arena from the stage all the more depressing.  The sound designers made a better effort, recording a nice selection of tac-net chatter to go along with the usual sounds of flight combat, but the dialogue could use a little more variety and one more run through the English-o-Matic.  In particular, something should have been done about the wingman who keeps moaning ~Have mercy on my soul!~This is a game that might have cut it in the last generation, but something more needs to be done with new technology than simply making something look a little prettier.  As far as gameplay goes, Lethal Skies doesn't do anything that hasn't been done on more than one console past.  This might still cut it if the competition hadn't already pulled ahead, but unfortunately for Asmik, it most emphatically has.Thus, there's not much reason to recommend Lethal Skies, unless your jones for flight shooting is so irrationally intense that you absolutely must have anything new.  And never mind how new it actually is...", "date": "Jun 12, 2002"}
