For those who were alive to enjoy them there are few things sweeter than sitting down for a few minutes of rudimentary gameplay with visuals that harken back to a simpler era. Whether these experiences are worth your hard-earned greenbacks and the time it takes to download them over Xbox Live, well, that's another discussion entirely.   Asteroids first debuted back in 1979 and is still considered one of the most influential games in history. The premise is simple: fly your spaceship around an asteroid field, shoot said asteroids, shoot the little asteroids that spew out of the bigger asteroid, and be mindful of the other alien ships that roam around the environment. The only twist being that you can jump into hyperspace to get out of sticky situations, but that comes at the risk of reappearing on top of an asteroid or self-destructing altogether. It's unsophisticated fun at its finest. Sadly it doesn't exactly translate into the greatest experience on Xbox 360, simply because you truly do feel like you're playing something from nearly 30 years ago.    Try to find the asteroid inside the explosion.  To sweeten the deal a bit Atari has included Asteroids Deluxe in the package. The gameplay is really no different. You still shoot asteroids, you still shoot alien ships, the only change is that instead of the hyperspace ability you can activate a shield when an object or laser blast gets too close for comfort. It certainly is more effective than hyperspace, but it still doesn't differentiate the original Asteroids from Deluxe nearly enough.   Asteroids Deluxe would not be a true Xbox Live Arcade release without a snazzy ~Evolved~ rendition. I'm not sure why developers feel the need to slap a bunch of LSD-inspired graphics onto every classic title, but Asteroids is another addition to the list that is substantially hurt because of it. While the asteroids and your ship look fine while floating around space, as soon as one of your laser blasts hits one of the massive space rocks it explodes in a huge flurry of color. That would be all fine and dandy if every particle didn't strongly resemble other asteroids. You'll die several times because you simply won't see the real asteroid fragments flying at you. It all feels very cheap and unnecessary.   There are two other game modes for both Asteroids and Deluxe, but they're actually nothing more than playing the game with the difficulty settings maxed out. In my mind a true mode isn't something that can be accessed in the options menu. Don't be fooled into thinking that with the Evolved verion, you're getting a truly new and exciting Asteroids experience for your 400 Microsoft Points.With Asteroids Deluxe youre getting a 20 year old game that can be found around the Internet for free. The feeling of playing Asteroids again will be fun for some, but it sure doesnt last long. The Evolved visuals are extremely cumbersome, even if they do brighten the screen and increase the presentation values and its disappointing to see that they limited the gameplay area to a 4:3 ratio rather than widening it out and delivering the full widescreen environment to roam around in. The Asteroids Deluxe package is another classic game that feels like its achievement points are worth more than the purchase itself.", "date": "Nov 29, 2007"}
