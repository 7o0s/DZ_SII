The similarities between Combat (1977) and Combat (2001) are few and far-between. The original game sold in a bundled package with the Atari 2600 system and necessitated two players. Prepubescent tankers faced off against one another on electronic battlefields represented by simple graphics. The original did not offer the best gameplay on the ancient system, but it did keep kids glued to their TVs. Even with over two decades worth of technological advancements in the video game industry, Combat (2001) delivers a gaming experience as bland as its progenitor's graphics.  Let's start by talking about the original Combat. Even though I was in diapers when the game was first designed, I remember playing it on the 2600 my father bought for me and my siblings with the money he earned from his second job. Tanks, fighter planes, machine guns, and missiles rounded out the features of Combat and, coincidentally, the doodles I produced on class notes from the second grade to college. The game's graphics may have been crap, but blowing up tanks and downing enemy fighter jets was the coolest thing in the world to me. I played that game for hours and especially enjoyed the tank game that utilized ricocheting shots -- tank pong. Ah the good ol' days....  Now, in 2001, Infogrames publishes Combat with revamped three-dimensional graphics and Internet capable gameplay. Sound good? Not so fast, cowboy. Missions are played out on maps that are reminiscent of early 1990s 3D shooters. Hovertanks replace the tanks, biplanes, bombers, and jet fighters of the original. You must pilot your tank in a third-person perspective, which makes the game frustrating for those used to using a first-person perspective to navigate (and you can forget about using a mouse -- keyboard or joystick only). The level design does not utilize a full 3D world -- there are no tunnels or buildings with multiple floors. I couldn't help but be reminded of DOOM when I navigated the elevator and terrace filled landscapes of Combat. I just don't understand why Magic Lantern Playware decided to design the game with a poor 3D engine rather than sticking with the original's 2D environment.   The hovertanks used in Combat obey physics that Sir Isaac Newton would have been proud of. The tanks follow Newton's laws of momentum and motion. Step off the gas and a very weak damping force pulls your tank to a halt in a couple hundred yards like a hockey puck sliding across a recently resurfaced ice rink. This is very similar to the physical model used in Asteroids and, as I recall, not Combat (1977). The result of the lack of friction, between tank and pavement, is a piloting nightmare. The game does have an emergency brake feature that can be used when faced with cliffhangers, but not integrating the brake into the game's engine puts a burden on the gamer that is unwarranted. Imagine playing a shooter in which your hero is constantly fighting on ice and you'll get the idea of how this game plays.  Combat's soundtrack is sprinkled with futuristic music that must have been taken from Buck Rogers or The Ice Pirates. The music pounds away with fast beats and synthesizer sounds. It's fairly entertaining and does a good job droning out the game's bland sound effects. The tank's cannon burps energy pulses with subdued pops. Even the constant drone of an Atari 2600 tank is more entertaining than these sounds.   One feature that would to seem to save this sinking ship is multiplayer. Unfortunately, Combat's is nothing special. You can play the game on a local area network (no spawn feature here) or through a direct TCP/IP connection -- if you could find someone else with the game! Combat purports to be playable over GameSpy but, when I logged onto the game house, I could not find it. Even if it was though, I'm sure the game would have zero participants.   There are plenty of budget shooters out there and this one doesn't stand out from the crowd. The game could have used the old Atari classic as a template and just boosted the game's look, features, and sound. That would have been an awesome game to play (at least rom a standpoint of nostalgia) and a bunch of people probably would have played it on their coffee breaks. But as it stands, Combat has no nostalgic value and without that the game is destined for a short run on the market.  -- Mike Murphy Want to share your opinions with the world?
