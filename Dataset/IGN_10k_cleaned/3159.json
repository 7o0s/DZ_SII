This was a subject of some debate around the office, inspired by the fact that his voice, in the English version of Ubi Soft's Disney's PK: Out of the Shadows, doesn't sound anything like Donald Duck.  The opposing camp argued that his hat was unmistakably Donald, and they they were in fact right.  Donald's crime-fighting alter ego PK was created in Italy, spun off out of translated reprints of the old Carl Barks duck comics, and has been a popular character in Europe for more than 30 years.   The history of PK's adventures is actually pretty interesting.  He's followed somewhat of the same arc as Superman and other American heroes, starting as an almost populist urban avenger and evolving into far-fetched science-fiction stories, but that doesn't quite answer the worthy question ~why?~  That is to say, why release a character-based action game in a country where nobody has ever heard of the character in question?   Disney's PK is a workmanlike action effort, one without any distinguishing qualities to those who aren't familiar with the setting and stars.  That makes it very hard to recommend over action games that do distinguish themselves -- Ratchet and Clank, Sly Cooper, and others.   Gameplay  This is about as straightforward an action game as you could imagine these days.  The level designs are linear and very straightforward, while PK's means of negotiating them are all entirely familiar.  He progresses somewhat, but many of his new powers are the rough equivalent of finding a new key or flipping a new switch -- i.e., they're simply a means of breaking through a particular type of barrier, rather than a versatile new gameplay element.   Combat employs a simple lock-on and strafe system, allowing PK to zap the bad guys from a distance while dodging their shots.  The basic AI obviates the necessity for any particularly complex maneuvering options -- the bad guys tend to just stand in one position and shoot -- but it also renders battles relatively devoid of excitement.  Though boss encounters take place in larger, more free-roaming areas, they don't employ concepts that we haven't already seen in plenty of 3D action games past.  My favorite bits, actually, were the game's brief shifts to side-scrolling action.  Simple, yes, but it's easier to make an engaging action game with that more limited style of presentation.   Compared, as I say, to something like Sly Cooper, this is at least a generation behind the design curve.  PK works on the level it aims for, but said level is so low, and the game's design so lacking in ambition, that it yields little enjoyment for anyone who's played a decent 3D platformer in the last five years.   Graphics  On the one hand, this is a decent rendition of a comicbook style, with basic backgrounds and sharply-outlined, cel-shaded characters.  On the other hand, objectively speaking, it still doesn't look that good.  While I can't argue either way regarding the narrative quality of PK throughout the years, I certainly agree with the die-hards who claim that the new sci-fi-based Evronian stories are a visual setback for the series.  Even the more impressive bad guys look like Duck Dodgers' spindly, bowlegged older brother.   What's also curious is that something with such simple visual quality would have any kind of technical problems at all.  PK, despite only a few moving objects and generally simple, sharp-edged backgrounds, has frequent draw-in problems with certain objects in the environment.  Power-ups and enemies sometimes just appear out of nowhere at short to medium range.  Odd camera direction is also an occasional intrusion, those few times where the game throws PK into a relatively complex area, or drops him through a large vertical section.   Sound  One of the interesting things about getting to play a game intended for the European market is the presence of multiple language options.  You can play PK with both French and Italian voices instead of English, which has a certain novelty value for the curious.  The English voices aren't all that great, anyway, especially the continuous intrusions of the supercilious One, PK's AI sidekick.  I find it dreadfully disappointing that a stuck-up green hologram with a stock British accent was deemed a fitting replacement for the legendary Gyro Gearloose.  Gyro Gearloose ruled.   Incidentally, yes, ranting about Gyro Gearloose is indeed a means of staving off the inevitable discussion of this game's dishwater-dull soundtrack.  The music consists of generic beats, occasionally interrupted by the bleeps and bloops spawned by exchanges of zapgun-fire between PK and his enemies.  Nothing to hear here, please move along directly.Could say that of this entire review, honestly.Playing Disney's PK was a rewarding experience in one way, at least -- I got a chance to find out who PK was, and in turn ponder the mystery of how a goofy-looking duck superhero would become such a big deal in Italian comicbooks.  But the game itself did very little for me, and that would probably go for most of you as well.  It's as generic as action games come today, and in such a crowded market, you don't have to settle for something like this.", "date": "Nov 7, 2002"}
