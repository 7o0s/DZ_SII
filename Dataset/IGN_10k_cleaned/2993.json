In fact, my dedication to the genre is one of the reasons I have this job today. Though Doug doesn't care for the genre much and Dave usually doesn't have the time to play them, RPGs are truly my bread and butter. I play any and all of them, and am always on the hunt for the next big thing to stand up along the likes of titles like Final Fantasy, Suikoden, and Dragon Quest.   One of those ~big things~ is the Grandia series. Arguably one of the Saturn and Dreamcast's finest offerings, Game Arts' beloved franchise has converted many a naysayer to full-fledged RPG geek in matter of hours. And though PlayStation 2 owners already had their very own port of the Dreamcast-based second installment last year, they hadn't yet received an original version to call their own. That is, until Grandia Xtreme.   Yet despite Grandia Xtreme's similarity to a traditional turn-based RPG, this is anything but. A side story to the normal Grandia continuity, this particular installment of Game Arts famous adventure is more action than anything. And while the more reserved genre fans out there may find the end result a tad disappointing, supporters of games like Legend of Legaia and Wild ARMs are sure to get a kick out of the simplistic setup. Traditional Role-Playing, this is not.   Story  Now most console RPGs live or die by their plotlines and side quests. In fact, some of the greatest Role-Players of all time wouldn't be called such without their backbones. Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, and Final Fantasy X are but a few examples of how excellent story devices can take a solid gameplay engine and turn it into something much greater. If that's what you're looking for in Grandia Xtreme however, you may need to turn your attention elsewhere.   It all begins with a young man named Evann, who like any great anti-hero is dodging his nation's military draft. Though he idolized his Ranger father, he doesn't feel that he's cut out to be a solider, and instead decides to dedicate his existence to honing his skills as a warrior. Before he can continue with his relaxed Bohemian lifestyle however, the Army actually kidnaps him and in true East-L.A. style, beat the living snot out of the boy to get him to join. After waking up in a strange room, Evann is made to join a small band of soldiers to put an end to something referred to as ~The Elemental Disorder~. And from there, the story continues.   Though it begins somewhat powerfully, the tale ultimately fizzles away into nothing. Since the main focus in Grandia Xtreme is on the constant battles and vulgarities, the plot takes a back seat to the action, which I found quite disappointing. I do realize however, that this is battle RPG first and foremost, so in all honesty, I wasn't that surprised.   Gameplay  The meat of Grandia Xtreme is the battle system. Slightly revamped over Grandia II, it's a modified version of the classic ~Active Time Battle~ scheme we've seen in a number of other RPGs over the last decade or so. If you've played the previous two versions of Grandia at length, getting into the new system should be as easy as that, as on the surface they're almost identical. Dig a little deeper however, and you'll start to notice the changes.   The biggest of which is the ability to form your own party instead of letting the computer do it for you. While past games have dictated your group based on the events of the storyline, Grandia Xtreme gives you full reign over your choices. While some may argue that it was a device used to take attention away from the weak story progression, I think it was more of a design choice to emphasize the fact that you've got a serious group of bad-asses waving their weapons in the air. Mix and match parties are always the most fun after all, and it was a wise move by Game Arts to finally let gamers have their choice.    Also edited is the Mana Egg system. Now able to combine eggs to form more powerful ones in addition to equipping them to anyone you so choose, your party's magical skills are a lot more varied than they were before. What this translates into is a host of options and customizability that when used in conjunction with other goodies like special skills, team attacks, and other similar techniques, are a whole lot of fun. There are plenty of ways to kill your foes and even more ways to damage them. That aspect of gameplay however, turns out to be a double-edged sword.   Simply put, there are too many enemies in Grandia Xtreme. Consistently bombarded with creature after creature, it's quite possible to run into thousands (that's right, I said thousands) of monsters in a single dungeon before completing it. Pile that aspect onto the fact that the dungeons themselves are absolutely gigantic (with some of them numbering in the hundreds of rooms), and you're going to be spending the majority of your time hacking and slashing away at everything that moves. And while I'm all for plenty of encounters in my RPG adventures, Grandia Xtreme takes it to a new level of ridiculousness.   Other trifling problems, like a somewhat uncooperative camera and a strange four-direction control scheme (no diagonal movement whatsoever) get in the way of Grandia Xtreme truly ascending a level of greatness. With so many foes coming at you from so many angles, Xtreme my find it hard to keep its audience after the first few hours of gameplay.   Graphics  I hate to say it, but the visuals in Xtreme are a step backward from Grandia II. The Dreamcast version of that game in particular was a big supporter of lush backgrounds and smooth textures, while the PlayStation 2 rendition matched it in every category (almost). In Grandia Xtreme however, the jaggies have come out in full force, the interface is more cluttered, and the somewhat dithered color palette only makes things less appealing.   That's not to say that Xtreme doesn't have its moments, because it does. The framerate in particular is a stout performer, and only occasionally dips below 30 fps when the screen is overly populated and the more powerful spells are unleashed. Additionally, there's practically no load time whatsoever, and traveling between screens is as fast as it would be in a cartridge.   I think what it all boils down to, is that Xtreme just doesn't have as much personality in its design as the second game did. Costumes, enemies, and dungeons are all on the uninspired side and when compared to that masterpiece and other big titles in the genre, it just doesn't compete. Not bad, but not great like it should be.   Sound  I'm of a split opinion on this one. On the one hand, you have star-powered names like Mark Hamill, Lisa Loeb, and Dean Cain attached to the characters, while on the other hand you've got the actual voice work itself. As there's definitely a difference between star power and good acting. Granted, Hamill keeps it consistent and does his usual great job of voice-over but Loeb, Cain, and the rest of the supporting cast seem to go up and down the palette of believability.   Musically, there are some truly engaging pieces worth talking about --specifically in the latter part of the game where the paper-thin plot makes an attempt at a comeback. For the majority of the adventure however, the quality of the soundtrack is almost 16-bitish with far too many blips and bleeps for my liking. Sadly, the audio effects don't fare much better and the usual ear-based splendor I associate with the Grandia series takes a hit.If you know what you're walking into, you'll probably have a lot of fun with Grandia Xtreme. More fighting than anything else, the action does have merit for those of us who stick with it. Although it's likely that dedicated dungeon crawlers like me will assuredly find themselves more forgiving of the game's shortcomings than the genre fans who buy only one or two big RPGs a year, the game still has its list of problems. Not a bad title by the usual definition of the word, Grandia Xtreme could have been a better title than what it turned out to be. A suitable placeholder until Grandia III officially hits the market, I could only recommend the Xtreme version of the series to diehard Game Arts fans and hyper active fantasy guys who have more than their fair share of free time.", "date": "Sep 30, 2002"}
