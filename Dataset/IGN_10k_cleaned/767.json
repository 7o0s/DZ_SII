It's like university cafeteria food  at the moment I saw it, and especially when I first started eating it, I knew it was going to be bad. I just didn't know how bad. Hopeful future game designers, seasoned design veterans, and diehard gamers read on  this is the unequivocal example of how not to design a game. And, ultimately, a lesson on how to drive a reviewer to the brink of insanity.   The first time I played Swamp Buggy Racing, after running through the quick install, I thought I'd try my hand at a race. I checked out the game menus and options, raced a few times, and generally explored around. Immediately, there was something that confused me. For some odd reason, there were only 2 tracks and 4 different cars showing up for me. I went back and checked it again - same thing. Wait, wait, wait...only 4 cars and 2 tracks? You've got to be kidding. I was so incredulous that I actually called up the Wizardworks PR people (I figured there must be more cars and tracks available through winning races, or cheat codes, or something I was missing). Apparently, they weren't kidding: my initial observation was correct  Swamp Buggy Racing has 4 'swamp buggies' and 2 tracks to race them on.   As if that wasn't unacceptable enough, the sound work is without a doubt the worst I have ever experienced. Immediately after loading Swamp Buggy Racing, there is this god-awful attempt at Cajun bayou music. Actually, the first time I heard the music, I was so unprepared for it that I immediately shouted out a loud expletive and jumped for my speakers. Then, when racing, you hear this indescribably bad hooting and cheering that sounds like they rounded up the small group of programmers and recorded them in the hallway with a karaoke microphone. They also had the brilliant idea to loop that monstrous sound throughout each entire race, in addition to the unspeakable music.   You know a game is wretched when the pre-intro company logo cinematics are better polished and more entertaining than the game itself. As for the beginning game intro, it consists of an atrociously animated movie of two 'swamp buggies', one driven by an ugly flannel-wearing Redneck and the other an Alligator. They race through the swamp to a finish flagged by a woman who looks like she was illustrated with a box of Crayolas. It simply has to be seen to be believed  it's just that bad.   As far as racing is concerned, it took me about 20 tries to finally complete one of the races. No, not because of the game's difficulty, primarily because I became so frustrated and enraged with the control that I quit out before I could finish. Once, in a fit of madness brought on by a particularly cheap crash that cost me what would have been my first victory in over a dozen attempts, I couldn't quit the game fast enough through the menu, so I hit the power off. The incident undoubtedly scared my roommates, and I plead temporary insanity by means of some of the worst game control ever inflicted upon a freelance writer. I am slowly coming to grips with the fact that I don't have what it takes to be ~King of the Swamp.~ For all but the most patient gamers it's nearly unplayable.   What I think is particularly bizarre here is that while Swamp Buggy Racing even went to the lengths of getting the NASRA license (that's the North American Swamp Racing Association), Swamp Buggy Racing has little or nothing in common with actual swamp buggy racing. Of the few times I've actually caught a glimpse on TNN of mud/swamp racing while flipping through the channels at 5:30 in the morning, I can say it certainly didn't look anything like this. I can't imagine that a huge percentage of the PC game buying population has actually seen a swamp buggy race, let alone heard of the NASRA, but even those few who are fans will be terribly disappointed with this product. Perhaps the only thing that Swamp Buggy Racing shares with its real life inspiration are the fantastic names of the buggies like ~The Secret Weapon,~ and my personal favorite, ~L-Mean-Yo.~  In some ways, I guess you could say the strong point of Swamp Buggy Racing is its graphics. They are 3D accelerated, and the 'buggies' themselves look passable. The wheels of the buggies move when you steer and the cars lift off the ground after jumps. But these 'features' are the expected industry-standard-norms for a race sim. Though, the first time I raced and noticed the background graphics, it really confused me. I stared at the screen for a moment, eyebrow raised, squinting to make out what the green splats of giant pixels were. Was it some kind of funky-looking graphics bug with my TNT card that was causing it? Then it dawned on me  the splat of giant green pixels was a tree. At least that's the current theory, but my girlfriend insists that if you look at them from just the right angle, they make a remarkably passable depiction of either Mother Teresa or Joey Lawrence.   Swamp Buggy Racing seemed somewhat stable (not that this is any kind of consolation for the poor, poor people who bought this title). I never experienced a fatal error or crash. There were a great deal of bugs and glitches, however. In fact, there wasn't a time I played the game that I didn't see some kind of graphics bug. Wizardworks is by no means the first company to release a product with a number of bugs, but this just adds another thing to the list. It's difficult to talk about the menu and game options, because quite honestly, both are nearly absent. There are very few options, and the menu system is functional and nothing more.   So, I'll make this simple: never, under any circumstance, should you buy or play this game. Although I'm sure the game was under-budgeted (or, as I'm beginning to suspect, perhaps not funded at all), the unbelievably small selection of tracks and cars simply isn't acceptable. Similar to the other excremental dregs floating in the bargain bins of local retail stores (such as the now legendary ~Extreme~ series of sports games), the entire Swamp Buggy Racing experience feels like one bad undergraduate Computer Science project taken way too far. When you get down to it, there's really not that much you can say. Occasionally, you'll play a game that's so bad it's good. This isn't the case with Swamp Buggy Racing. It's just....bad.   Even though the back of the box urges you to ~plunge yourself into the middle of the fun,~ I would vehemently suggest otherwise.  -- Erik Peterson", "date": "Mar 8, 2000"}
