Which is why when something in those areas comes along that tries some new things and really makes an effort, I like to get behind them. One such game I'm going to go ahead and give some props to is Soldiers of Anarchy coming from Silver Style and Simon & Schuster. The game pretty effectively combines titles like the mighty X-Com and Commandos with the quick pace of real time play. The RPGish elements for building your force over the course of the game and watching them grow add to some good level design, fantastic sound, and an awesome engine. The game is really only hampered by it's near brainless pathfinding AI and some odd choices for voice over work.   Soldiers of Anarchy takes place about 12 years in the future. The threat of bio-terrorism finally came to a head in 2004 when a man made virus was created and billions of the Earth's inhabitants died. Countries were forced to quarantine entire cities until they realized they could never hold in the millions of citizens. France even went so far as to drop two tactical nukes on Paris to stem the tide of the disease and save humanity from extinction. Eventually, society and government fell apart and chaos reigned.   Six people, five men and one woman (poor, poor woman), part of a combined forces team from Russia, Germany, and the United States all decided to hole themselves up in a basement bunker in an old military base in Russia and wait out the virus. After collapsing the entrance to the valley in which the base was situated, they remained 10 years underground for fear of a nasty death. As you might imagine, 10 years is a little long to stay confined indoors, underground, without the light of the sun, and knowing that your septic tank has got to reach its limit one of these days. So the six decided it was time to open up the bunker, wander into the world, and take their chances with the virus. Only when crawling out of the basement, they had no idea what they would find, if they could find anything at all.   So began the game as your bring your five beginning troops out into the valley, set a charge and open up the base to the world at large. Soon thereafter you quickly discover that the world had not completely died. But you'll also realize that it has gone to complete crap. The world has dropped into a state of anarchy with large gangs that have either managed to salvage weapons of war or former military groups have banded together into gangs for profit and survival. Things are very violent in this world and it seems things are just going to get stranger. People are being abducted for experiments and you still have no idea the origins of the 2004 disaster. You'll have to investigate these things and more as you recruit more men and women to your team and salvage any equipment that you come across.   One of the best things about Soldiers of Anarchy is perhaps the way it deals with resources and troops. Nothing is used lightly in this game, especially your individual troops. They're your most important assets and you'll begin to care about them enough that you most definitely won't want to see them die. Each of these soldiers has the chance to gain experience and level up over the course of the game. They get more accurate and skilled as they progress in rank and even have the opportunity to gain specific skills to round your troops out. They can be promoted to small arms specialists, heavy weapons specialists, explosive experts, medics, sharpshooters, or even be given an athletic boost so they can do everything faster than normal. You'll need to balance your forces wisely over the course of the game to be successful.   You'll also be able to pump your forces up and build them appropriately through outfitting them and giving them medical enhancements in between missions when you return to your base. In order to outfit your men with new weapons and items, you're going to have to find them in the game. Your only resources, since money has gone the way of the dodo, are the things you can find in the field. Each of the soldiers you come across in the game will be carrying some kind of weapons and equipment. When you kill them, they'll drop their stuff and you can pick it up for use or for trade. Of course, your soldiers can only carry a certain amount, so you can bring vehicles along with you to hold extra equipment (which I'll get into in a minute). In order to be successful in each of the missions, you'll need to outfit your team wisely with weapons that correspond to their specialties. So giving the RPG or M-60 to a heavy weapons specialist is smarter than giving it to the sharpshooter. You can also give them special items like grenades, binoculars or night vision, and personal armor. Giving your guys the right equipment to stay alive is key.   If there're some weapons that you don't have that you want, then you can trade with the Seekers, who are the traders in the game. Once you meet them, they'll be at your base from then on so you don't have to wait and find them like Silver Style had originally planned. I'm really glad they did this cause it makes things a lot easier and much more fun. Of course, the trader won't let you get a steal of a deal, but you'll also be able to tell when you're giving him too good a deal because he gets pretty excited. You'll also be able to trade for vehicles, ammunition, and items so you'll need to pick everything up on the field of play that you possibly can.   Also in the base is a lab where you can manufacture health kits and pills that will give your soldiers enhancements for a short period of time. You can also give your soldiers permanent enhancements by giving them hormone treatment. This will allow them to live longer and be stronger. All of these things take time though. You'll see at the bottom of the screen how many hours you have total before your next mission. Healing soldiers, making medpack and pills, and giving hormone treatments all take a certain amount of time. You'll need to choose where to spend your time on each trip back to the base.   Once you've got your crew outfitted, healed and prepped, you can choose who you want to go on your missions (you can command twelve in all) and then head out onto the field. Soldiers in the field have a pretty nice array of options for them. They can run, crouch, or crawl, climb certain areas walls and fences, jump into any empty vehicles and put them to use, throw grenades, use any and all weapons, plant explosives, pick up and place mines, and salvage all of the goods you need. They're all fully articulated models, so you can see them pick up weapons, run across the landscape, bring out different weapons, crawl into the various vehicles and so on. The animations are done surprisingly well giving you the distinct impression that these are real little people running across the world.    And the vehicles that you can grab a hold of are even better than the people! The models are really, really good. Hatches open in the right place, turrets turn and lock on to targets, treads move, wheels bounce, carriages rock... it's all there. You can even see the soldiers sitting inside of each of the vehicles. Which is why in order to use them properly, you'll have to have two people in them at the same time. One to drive and one to use the weapons. In some cases, you'll even see the soldiers pop up out of the vehicle, grab a hold of the turret and start firing. He'll swivel back and forth tracking targets and firing. And there are plenty of real world vehicles to take control of. You'll see everything from small civilian cars to the powerful T-55 tanks. You'll also be able to use flying vehicles like attack helicopters. All of the vehicles also come with some level of customization. You can swap weapons and ammo in and out and add more armor to them. You'll see the changes take place on the vehicles in the game as well. So your Humvee with an M-60 mounted on it and the one with a TOW Rocket launcher will have the appropriate model. This is also how you will have to make some of your decisions in the game. Seeing what weapons enemy soldiers and vehicles are carrying will give you a better chance at success, which also means scouting is necessary.   In fact, the variation in mission style is pretty good as well. There are some that call for nothing but brute force. Others will make you take a couple of soldiers out of your vehicles for a stealthy operation to destroy enemy installations. These stealth missions are just as good as the combat ones too. The mission structure is generally good leaving only dull moments when you're picking up and sorting out weapons and trying to get your stupid vehicles to move across the map.   Orders are given via a pretty good interface for selecting units. You can give them either by clicking and right clicking or by holding down the mouse and seeing all of your options pop up in a smart icon menu system that can be pretty helpful.    The gameplay isn't without its problems though. In fact, it has one very big problem that is really just plain amazing. The pathfinding for both the soldiers and the vehicles is really bad. One of the most important things to an efficient RTS is the frickin' pathfinding. How they could get everything else so right in this game and screw this up so bad is beyond me. Vehicles can't even drive straight down the damn road. They weave constantly and quickly giving the impression that they're running some crazy slalom that I couldn't see. But that part isn't the worst of it. The vehicles will literally run into each other and go the wrong F'ing direction half the time. Some of the time, they won't move at all like you gave them a place they just couldn't possibly get to, even if that place is in the middle of a field. If you give them many points to roll to on the way, then they can make it, but otherwise, no. And half the time, they'll make really strange decisions on directions to take, even if it moves them through a clearly marked minefield. If you don't pay a lot of attention to your units while moving them, you could suddenly find that you're missing a tank and a couple of your veteran units. Save often is the call of the day I guess, although that is a pretty shallow fix for the problem.   The soldiers aren't quite as bad, but they'll also take roundabout ways to locations. This is especially annoying when you want them to take certain paths to stay out of the sight of enemies. These stubborn little jerks also will take it into their own hands to win the war every now and again by refusing to run away from superior numbers no matter what their aggressiveness setting or how many times to vigorously click on the landscape.   Both the soldiers and the vehicles have a recognition problem as well. If they're in transit to some location and you give change the direction you want them to move to, they'll stop, think about it, and then turn and move in that direction. After becoming used to immediate response from units in RTSs over the years, this is more than a little frustrating and unforgivable. Having your units respond immediately in a real time game is important!    What did you think of Soldiers of Anarchy? The amount of detail in everything graphic that went into this game is outstanding. From the terrain and sky to the vehicles and buildings. The problem is, in order to run the game at full detail; you're going to need one hell of a machine. My 1.4ghz, 512MB RAM, GeForce 3 at home just didn't cut it. I had to lower the detail down quite a bit to get a good frame rate meaning the shadows disappeared along with a bunch of the texture depth. Sure, that comp isn't the be all end all of computers anymore, but it's by no means slow. Still, even at that lower detail, the game looks pretty good.   The sound also is exceptional in the case of weapons fire and explosions. And while the voices aren't that bad in themselves, you have to wonder how all of these crazy British and yokel Americans ended up in Russia. This game does take place in Russia, right? Am I totally reading things wrong? It's pretty strange. It's almost like they thought American gamers couldn't handle it or needed something to relate to... Even so, the voices that are there range from entertaining to annoying, but none of them are horrible.Soldiers of Anarchy is a test in patience, both in terms of having to set up your battles and use thought and planning to puzzle out the best strategies, but also because of some terrible pathfinding. It's really too bad because Silver Style added a whole lot else to like. The RPG elements of your soldiers and team make keeping them alive and well important to you and adds quite a bit of interest to creating a formidable fighting force. The graphics are really great on high detail, but unless you have an amazing computer, you won't be able to run at a decent framerate when the battles begin. The sound is a hit an miss affair with some odd choices for voice overs and some fantastic weapons fire.This is one of those games I really want to recommend to everybody but I just can't bring myself to. I think that those people who can get past the pathfinding problems will have an amazing time playing this game and enjoying the thoughtful experience, I know I have. But that could be a pretty tall order for many RTS gamers who are used to immediate response. I know I got pretty annoyed on more than a few occasions. The lack of a pause and order feature makes this issue even more frustrating. It's really too bad they didn't spend more time polishing this up because it could have been one hell of a game.", "date": "Nov 13, 2002"}
