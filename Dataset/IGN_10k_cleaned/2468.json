If a character can jump, he can star in his own videogame. The ~hardcore~ gamers complain and gripe about these senselessly-licensed games flooding the market -- then never buy or play them -- but the truth is that, while they rarely add anything new to the platforming genre, there's quite a few that are worth a run-through. Donald Duck saw a pretty good one on Game Boy Color a little bit back, and, never one to quit, he's back to shake his tail feathers on GBA.  Features  18 levels with the world's quackiest character Password save Only for Game Boy Advance   While Donald Duck Adv@nce !*# (I'll stop with the silly spelling Ubi Soft put on the box right now) looks and seems to be a remake of the Game Boy Color version -- same worlds, same mission and same hero, of course -- the GBA game is actually a completely new game set in the same themed stages as the original, and has a few extra platforming controls to throw in as well. Heck, Ubi Soft is a bonafide factory for these senselessly-licensed platformers -- they'll crank out a hop-about quicker than the license-bearer has time to tell then not to bother -- so giving an actual star like Donald a whole new adventure must have been an automatic. Unfortunately, their efforts aren't quite as well-honed as last time -- not that the game isn't fun, it's just that the Ubi machine doesn't seem to be as finely tuned in this game.  What Ubi Soft has managed superbly again in a platformer is to take simple gameplay mechanics -- a jump, a double-jump with a butt-bounce, and a new dash move -- and make these simple things interesting and enjoyable again and again. You always know when you're going to like a platformer: in the first few seconds, if it's fun to move the character around in the stage, it'll probably be a fun game, and if you find new ways to use simple moves a few seconds later, it might even be great. The last Donald had that, and a few other Ubi games pull it off as well (Rayman sort of sets the path); Donald Duck Advance has it as well. Donald doesn't jump or double-jump as high as before, but smart use of the double-jump and dash-jump will get you everywhere in this game.  The game is also nicely drawn again, although that's pretty much a given on GBA. Donald was a technical stunner on GBC, but on the new hardware, the team has just sat back and let the GBA's sprite powers and color pallette do its own work. Some parallax scrolling stands out here and there, but the game doesn't really do much with the GBA -- the haunted mansion's ghosts are just dithered sprites, and turning blocks just leap into place instead rotating. Still, good design is good design -- Donald Duck Advance is colorful and has nice animation, including a visibly different animation set for when Donald gets mad. And, while the sampled music is again not technically as dazzling as a MIDI/sample mix would be, the zany cartoon trills ring out pretty clear with a lot of spirit.  Yep, Donald's almost done it again ... and yet, the game missing a tiny bit of polish. Some of the problems seem to be turning out a common problem for GBA platformers: a wide screen + bigger characters = more leaps of faith and cheap hits from above or below. This becomes a bigger problem here because enemies regenerate when you scroll back to an area --sometimes this helps solve a puzzle, but usually it just means you'll take an unnnecessary hit (and they respawn fairly early, so you can hardly be off-screen floating on a balloon or spring, and they'll pop back under you for another hit). There's also sometimes screwy collision detection on Donald's butt-bounce. It's pretty rare, but it's annoying when you're reflexes nearly save you from a cheap hit and yet the game flakes out and kills you.  And then, there's the extra challenge...the most painful frustration I've played in a long, long time. Since the game is pretty short, Ubi Soft has tossed in a collect-the-stars game to add more replay time. Well, this little extra sure will have you playing a lot longer than it took to first whip through the game. You may spend hours in a stage trying to make one or two of the toughest attempts. The problem is that the designers made it that respawned enemies don't give out the stars that they did the first time around -- miss one, and start all over again. Not that the game is ever hard (or not fun), but the star challenge becomes a real bear pretty quickly...when you have to bounce off one guy, then bounce off another, then in a midair double-jumped fall collect all the stars that are steadily floating away while trying not to fall into the chasm Donald's perched over, and sometimes you miss one fast-drifting blue star because an enemy respawned just out of the screenspace and hit you while you were pulling off the impossible, so you have to start the whole level over again ... it just doesn't seem fair!  And the secret prize for all this? Could it be...a block puzzle?!? Alright, so maybe I'm giving this game too much guff just because that little extra sucked my patience away (and I did finish it - it's not a block puzzle, by the way, but it's still not worth the effort). The bottom line is really that it's a good game, but just doesn't last all that long. With only one boss and four worlds to play (each world has variety, but the levels in them are just variations on the theme), it's another senselessly-licensed platformer worth a rental. It's just not one of those polished gems you'd really should have in your library.", "date": "Feb 7, 2002"}
