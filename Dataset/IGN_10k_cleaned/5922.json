{"name": "Turbo 21", "name_review": "Turbo 21", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/12/turbo-21", "text": "is the one Pogo.com release of the initial salvo I actually had a hard time really getting into -- of course, this could have been because I was having difficulty tearing myself away from Tri-Peaks Solitaire. This Pogo.com-branded effort shoots a little smack into the blackjack vein, forcing players to play a modified four-handed game of twenty-one. The goal is to use the available cards to make as many twenty-one hands as possible before the clock runs out. This is far easier said than done.   The game keeps turning over new cards, which you must drop into wells to create your winning hands. The game will keep an easy-to-read tally of each well so you know how close you are to 21 per hand. The cards do not vanish until you either hit 21 or bust out by going over. The more wells you clear successfully, the more tokens you earn in the post-game wrap-up.   As mentioned, I just wasn't able to get into the game, but I do know a player who is an absolute addict to the PC version. He appreciates how fast the games are, and that benefit certainly makes the transition to mobile, where gaming sessions might be even more bite-sized than those snuck in between filing TPS reports.   The cards are easy to read and the numerical information, such as the timer and the card counts, are cleanly displayed.  Turbo 21 is a casual game that, due to its frenzied pace, doesn't feel very casual. Laid-back gamers might want to seek out another Pogo.com game, such as Tri-Peaks Solitaire. Some may enjoy how quick it is to burn off a game (and thusly add tokens to your Pogo reservoir), but I was just never able to warm up to it. Your mileage may vary.", "date": "Aug 12, 2005"}
