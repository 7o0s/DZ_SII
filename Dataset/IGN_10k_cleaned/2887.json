{"name": "Turok: Evolution", "name_review": "Turok: Evolution Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/03/turok-evolution-review", "text": "Over a half decade ago, a developer by the name of Iguana Entertainment broke onto the scene with Turok: Dinosaur Hunter for the Nintendo 64. It was an impressive first-person shooter for home consoles at the time, offering up a mix of gory visuals, exaggerated weaponry, and even platform elements. Thanks to some notable sales, it wasn't long before Acclaim had Iguana start on the sequel Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. It is largely regarded as the most ambitious Turok, because it brought unprecedented ~high-rez~ -- as Acclaim coined it -- 640x480 visuals, stunning animations, massive environments, and a multiplayer mode onto a sizable N64 cartridge. Only Turok 2's unbalanced game design held it back from complete greatness.   It managed to simultaneously surprise and disappointed fans of the franchise, which left them frothing at the mouth for a more perfected sequel. Of course, Acclaim was intent on delivering on that and did indeed release Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion for the N64 in mid-2000. However, it was largely viewed as a step backward in the series, as it further strayed away from the Lost Lands roots and dinosaur themes that the franchise was popular for. This could be attributed to the fact that Iguana Entertainment had seen changes to the staff and company restructuring whilst it gathered under the new name Acclaim Austin.   This wasn't the end of Turok, though. Acclaim Austin wanted to bring the Dinosaur Hunter into the next-generation. After over two years of diligent work, the major installment in the series is complete. Called Turok: Evolution, it is a return to the lush, dino-infested jungles that fans grew attached to since the series' inception. Acclaim Austin once noted that it would be the best Turok yet, with more gore, better graphics, and new variations on gameplay such as flying. But, is it? Read on.   Features  Storyline follows the original conflict in the Lost Lands Single-player mode takes players on a lengthy 15-chapter quest Players can run, jump, climb, swim, or use stealth throughout the game All-new flight sequences send gamers soaring in intense shooting missions Squad-based AI creates diverse battle grounds All-new weapons including Variable Payload Cruise Missiles, Gravity Disrupter Beams, and the Swarm Bore each with unique traits and damage Weapons are upgraded for further functionality, a pistol becomes your sniper rifle Scripted event sequences keep you on your toes Dozens of different types of prehistoric and indigenous life Destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees onto enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaur Unique multiplayer mode developed by a dedicated team of designers, programmers and artists Graphics engine offers up lush, living jungle environments and moody, dimly lit indoors  A superb range of sound effects, offered up in Dolby Digital 5.1 Epic sound score compliments the action wonderfully   Gameplay Acclaim Austin knew that it had to bring that that old-school Turok feeling if it hoped to salvage the franchise name as respectable in the ever-competitive realm of first-person shooters. Having said that, Turok: Evolution is a story of origin, complete with everyone's favorite Turok, Tal'Set, who was lead in Dinosaur Hunter. In fact, this is a prequel that tells the story of how Tal'Set became the man he is, and the story opens with him fighting with his nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas. In their tussle, the two fall into a rift between their world and the Lost Lands, a mysterious place full of civil upheaval and much danger. Thus the adventure of Turok: Evolution begins as Tal'Set continues to seek revenge on the wicked Bruckner in the middle of the tumultuous world.     As Tal'Set, you begin with nothing but your heavy Warhammer and trusty bow in hand. The first world is a verdant jungle with but a few warriors lining its paths. It's basically a training level, but one that's very needed to adjust to the new controls and massive worlds. There is no objective initially laid out before you, but in classic Turok fashion you will likely receive a few shots to the body to thrust you angrily in the right direction. After killing the foe, you realize you'll need to collect the object that has appeared in his wake. Naturally, this sends you testing out your first-person platforming skills as you climb to the top of a small peak. There you will find a pistol and, of course, the mystery object. What's most interesting is that you are forced to jump out onto a tall pillar to collect the item and subsequently open a new path. The catch is that there's no pathway back down. You're just left standing high above the ground, and leaping down might cause your death. Looking around, you find a large body of water below. What's left to do but plunge in and press onward? Indeed, this clever mix of platforming and long-range first person shooting is something we remember fondly in the first Turoks, and it's executed quite well in Evolution.   That said, the design definitely pays tribute to the original. This has its benefits for nostalgia, but also its drawbacks when being compared to modern first-person shooters. The design of Evolution calls for the usual elements: kill all enemies to open a door, pull the available switches, etc. There's a whole crop of highly regarded first-person shooters that have set new standards in the modern day. For the home console, Halo is easily the most highly held, and Turok has to attempt to live up to that. To try to push the envelope forward, Acclaim Austin has implemented a few key elements in hopes to improve the gameplay experience.     The most mentionable is the all-new airborne shooting element, which Acclaim has wanted to include flying missions since it came up with the idea for Turok. Taking to the air on the back of an ancient bird is now a major part of the gameplay, and breaks up the ground-based, first-person shooting action every several chapters. The controls are fairly intuitive and the action reminiscent of titles like Star Fox, but in the end it's just a distraction from the main line of gameplay. In concept, it's designed to serve as a refreshing break from the ground-based gameplay. In execution, however, it can become quite tedious. Turok: Evolution's engine is designed for running along the ground at slow speeds, not flying over them quickly, and it shows. The game frequently stops in the middle of your flying missions to save and load the next area. It's pretty disorienting, and, if you're not careful, you're likely to even lose your bearings enough to crash your bird. Considering this much, we were pleased to see Acclaim Austin's attempt to inject a fresh gameplay concept into Turok's new adventure, but it could have been better executed.   Getting back to the FPS element, Acclaim Austin has made it possible to use world objects against your foes. In the jungle areas you can knock over towering trees onto opponents with a well placed shot. It's not necessary, but it can save on ammo and health. This function shows up somewhat randomly throughout the whole game. You'll find pillars to topple onto opponents in addition to those that will shatter into pieces, leaving less objects for the enemies to hide behind. Once again, though, it's a cool concept that could have been more refined.     Really, the main quest is very linear and unsurprising. It has its moments, but the draw to push forward is largely due to the want to do battle with the dinosoids. Two major components that form this experience are enemy intelligence and decked out weaponry. The latter is one of the series' longtime trademarks. Turok is always equipped with some of the most incredible weapons, and his latest arsenal is no exception. You can snipe enemies from great distances with your Tek Bow or embellished pistol, blow the masses to pieces with multiple rockets, or set anything ablaze with your flamethrower. These are ~normal~ by comparison to some of the more obscure weapons you earn later in the game. The Gravity Disruptor is a favorite of ours, where you can charge up a seismic blast to send enemies flying outward around you. Or, with its upgraded secondary function, you can use it as a tractor beam of sorts to pick up enemies and bludgeon them up against walls until they come to pieces. The ~bore~ has returned, as well. This time, titled the ~Swarm Bore,~ it fires multiple projectiles that enter an enemy's body to dismember it slowly, limb by limb. This part of Turok's perceivable world has remained intact. The weapons are very cool.  Finally, we should mention what is one of the most important aspects of any first-person shooter: the artificial intelligence. Acclaim Austin has been toiling away on what it calls Squad Dynamics System (S.D.S). It revolves around the idea that you are not just fighting a group of mindless fools. Some of them are thickheaded and others are tactical leaders. So, as Tal'Set, you have to make decisions whether you want to storm into an area and use powerful weapons, or if you want to try to approach things more slowly, picking off the more powerful foes first. We experienced quite a few instances where a weakling troop dropped his gun when injured badly and to go alarm more units to seek us out. If taken out in time, this situation would have been averted. Even more impressive is that the enemies were very good at dodging your shots and ducking for cover. It's quite common to see them run away from you to crouch behind a tree or large object, whereupon they will take care to peek out and fire off shots. Occasionally, it even serves as a distraction from enemies that will flank behind you. It's all pretty stellar most of the time, but you can't make it through a level without encountering some buggy AI. You can shoot down an enemy right in the sight of another and he seeks no cover. On an even more extreme level, we've even managed to sling arrows into enemies from a great distance and see no reaction at all.       This seems to be a pattern with Turok: Evolution; with the good, comes the bad. On a very general level the four edition to the series is actually a solid first-person shooter, but it seems to be caught in the past and even unfinished in some regards. There's a very odd glitch in the game where you must destroy enemies spawning in a room to open a set of doors to move forward. After you destroy all the enemies, the doors swing open, and there's an invisible wall blocking your progress -- you can shoot through it, even toss grenades through it, but Turok cannot pass. The reason why is that the doors were apparently not supposed to swing open until you physically destroyed the spawning mechanisms in the room. It sounds like a ~puzzle,~ but invisible walls have no context in the situation.   Then we have the control scheme. This has improved greatly, and now draws on the dual analog system that most console shooters draw upon. Curiously, though, there's a total lack of options outside of the standard move/strafe for the left stick and look/turn for the right stick. The Xbox and PlayStation 2 versions have one alternate setting that gives players the option to use the four face buttons for the old-school Turok-style controls, but the GameCube's alternate just swaps the functions of the right and left stick, likely aimed at left-handed individuals. This can serve as a rather crippling blow to enjoying the game for those who cannot become accustomed to the regular setup.   Closing on our thoughts here, we think Turok can best be summed up a slightly above average first-person shooter that is home to a number of flaws. Hardcore Turok fans will no doubt find the experience nostalgic and enjoyable, but for many, Evolution will feel ho-hum and even tedious at points. We think that if Acclaim Austin had several more months to polish out the gameplay, it could have definitely been a must-play and even worthy purchase. However, as the final version released to the market stands, it just isn't cutting-edge or polished enough to be considered as such. That isn't to say that Evolution is a bad experience, though. It has its fill of thrilling moments and monster boss battles, but in the scope of things, that will not be enough to appease more demanding gamers.     Multiplayer Let us also briefly note multiplayer. It's actually been designed as a separate component from the main game. Meaning, there are themes and level concepts inspired from the main game, but pretty much all of the levels are totally unique. It also has a host of power-ups such as jump boots and armor plates that change the pace of the matches. There's an Empathy Chest Plate, for instance, that, when worn, will protect you 50% damage while reflecting the other half back at your opponent. Little extras along with the wide-open environments and insane weaponry definitely make for a compelling multiplayer experience.   Graphics Huge, fogless, verdant jungle environments and dimly lit, moody indoors are the focus on the graphics engine. The jungles are very lush, packed with thick grass, innumerable trees, and lot of indigenous life. You actually feel somewhat claustrophobic if you step into an area that shrouds you in foliage. You can even lose your sense of direction if you're not careful. So, the ground covering is effectively designed. Equally, the indoor environments are usually large labyrinths, moderately textured and complex with geometry. Overall, though, Turok: Evolution isn't exactly an eye-popping game, save for some of the work the team did on Xbox.   The lighting is fantastic on the Xbox version.  The only one to feature dynamic lighting, you'll see gunfire illuminate hallways and see some impressive heat effects reminiscent of Wreckless.  There are areas where the textures are really solid.  You'll get close to a wall and see cracks in the sediment.  Then there are other moments where you'll look at the ground and see some lovely blurred out slop that can barely be called a texture.  This imbalance is a perfect fit for the rest of the game.    Sound Like the past Turoks, the sound design is easily the most impressive part of the game. The soundtrack is wildly varied and does a brilliant job setting the mood. The sounds of screeching horns and pounding drums will have your heart thumping. This is perfectly complimented by the sound effects, too. Again, Acclaim Austin did a splendid job of recording the sounds of wildlife in addition to all the subtle effects of bullets clanking on the floor and even the ~squishy~ footsteps of the shoeless reptilians that chase you around.   The Xbox is blessed with some fantastic use of Dolby 5.1.  The gun sounds great.  There's nothing like hearing that mini-gun warm up.  Great separating and an amazing score.  There are some weird sound glitches though.  Like you'll hear a boss enemy repeat the same phrase five times in succession.  A great overall effort on sound that really does a nice job making use of the Xbox hardware. Being the Nintendo 64 fan that I am, I've been a fan of Turok since the original. Running around in the foggy jungle environments, climbing vined walls, and warping into futuristic settings to slay the hulking, dinosaur-themed beasts always sat well with me. Of course, this was back in 1997 when I was just getting used to first-person shooters that didn't look as dated as Wolfenstein or Doom. So many years have passed and it seems that Turok has had a hard time keeping up with the high standards that recent first-person shooters have set.As a matter of fact, Turok's best appeal right now is the gore. It's very amusing to decapitate a slimey dinosoid or to blow six of them sky-high with a multi-firing rocket launcher. The sniper elements of Turok have always been a strong point too. In just the first few levels of Evolution, I got to upgrade my pistol to a sniper rifle and take out enemies from great distances. This is always fun. But, more of the same just isn't enough in this case. Turok had great potential to leap into to the next-generation market with its excessive gore and unique theme. Unfortunately, the title seems like it wasn't fully thought out and even rushed to completion. Many of the ideas such as the flying missions and advanced AI seemed to have only met the once-grand concept halfway. Having said all that, I found Turok: Evolution to be a mix of enjoyment and frustration. At times I was thoroughly amused, sniping enemies and causing mayhem, while at other moments I was frustrated and in a state of pure tedium. I can only recommend that the most hardcore of Turok fans pick the title up. Everyone else will want to stick to a rental, because it's definitely worth checking out, especially given that the multiplayer mode is quite entertaining.", "date": "Sep 3, 2002"}
