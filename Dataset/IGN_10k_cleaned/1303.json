Known best perhaps as the Mecca for many a Mike Tyson fight, (or the stomping grounds for a couple of Wrestlemanias), the house that Donald built is synonymous with high-risk entertainment. Bustling gambler activity, beautiful showgirls, and celebrities out the wazoo only begin to explain the type of treat you're in for with a trip to such a location. But wait! What if you could actually bottle all that up into one GD-ROM and bring the excitement home to millions and millions of Dreamcast gamers? Sounds great doesn't it? Yeah, too bad that it isn't.  Developed by the gang at Runecraft (the same people responsible for Mat Hoffman's BMX and Spec Ops), Caesar's Palace 2000 is a title rife with would have been's and could have been's. A bare-bones recreation of gambling at it's most basic, the attempt at recreating an accurate casino model is almost realized... but ultimately falls short of one major aspect; fun.  It's not that the game doesn't have it's share of games to play, oh no. That's not it at all. There are plenty of time wasters thrown into the mix for even the most seasoned of gamblers. Spanish 21, Blackjack, Roulette, Craps, Mini-Baccarat, Slot Machines, electronic Poker units, Pai-Gow, and a couple of other favorites have all made the cut. Hell, everything you can think of short of horse racing is probably in here, but it's just not that entertaining.  Now I will admit that I spent a fair amount of time on the Blackjack tables, and the Video Poker game was all right... but where's the glamour? Where's the ritzy, Atlantic City-type pizzazz we associate with high-stakes gambling? Go ahead and look around at your most casual; you will soon realize that personality is simply not there.  A big reason for this is the lack of aesthetics. There aren't any waitresses walking the floor, or fellow players huddled in groups checking out their deals. We can't take a tour of the casino or converse with those around us (because there isn't anyone to talk too), and we can't even see the face of our dealer. In fact, the only distinguishing feature that separates the tables from one another is a different (and glitchy) voice actor. Whoopee.   The casino itself is a head shaker too. As we are only privy to a single menu screen by which to choose our game from, and looking around or checking out games in progress is not an option (which would've been a cool little feature, as even Leisure Suit Larry on the PC has elements of this thrown in. And that game is incredibly old). And while I can understand that these types of interactive jaunts aren't necessarily for everyone, the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint the most basic of cavemen.  Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render. My personal choice for worst image however, has to be the dealer's hands. Resembling an old Mortal Kombat screenshot, the digitized set of fingers and thumbs looks particularly out of place when shuffling and dealing. Remember that sparkle the player's bodies had way back in the original version of Links LS? Same thing.  Of course the ultimate problem with the game lies within the way it handles money. Sure you start off with $2000 dollars and must build your fortune from there, but there's really no point. If you lose it all, you can just go back to the ATM machine the game provides and borrow some more... seemingly with no limit. What kind of incentive do you have to play a game about gambling if you can make your stash by endlessly borrowing the cabbage? Strategy, caution... all those thinking aspects of gambling are thrown out the window as you can easily bet everything you have time and again without fear of losing your shirt. Ugh.  In fact, the only redeeming quality I could find with Caesar's Palace 2000 was it's experience feature. Depending on how much you win and how often you play, you can move up the ladder of difficulty and increase your betting limits. Eventually garnering you a shot at the Emperor's room where you can start to make some serious cash. But where's the reward for all this? There isn't one!   It's unfortunate that in the year 2000, with all the technological feats and accomplishments that have been made over the last decade or so, that our gambling simulators are still this basic. Easily outclassed by the enormously entertaining Nintendo classic Vegas Dream, it would be a wiser bet to pop that old geezer in your console and give it a go. With better play mechanics, superior music, and far more personality than Caesar's Palace 2000, the odds are you'll have a lot more fun with the old school.", "date": "Oct 3, 2000"}
