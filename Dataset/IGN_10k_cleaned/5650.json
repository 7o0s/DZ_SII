It's a pretty undisputable fact. But games with ninjas don't necessarily rock. Ninja Gaiden was an excellent game with a fighter in pajamas and the Tenchu games have done some good work in the same territory, but Red Ninja: End of Honor shows that sometimes a ninja game can scrape the bottom of the barrel. It would have been a pleasure to see a game bring some more stealthy ideas to the genre, and Red Ninja has a couple, but this isn't the place to look.   Red Ninja follows Kurenai, a female ninja assassin, as she sneaks and kills her way through 16th century Japan. She has some throwing knives and a sword, but her main skills involve a tetsugen and her own womanly beauty. The tetsugen is a weight at the end of a wire that Kurenai can throw at enemies to knock them over or even slice them in half. It's such an effective weapon that it's almost besides the point to even bother with anything else in the game. Just sneak up on the enemies from behind, wire them up, and take them down. And if that doesn't quite work, Kurenai can seduce them.   Kurenai is a videogame heroine is what you'd imagine a marketing department would ask for to appeal to the 12 year-old demographic. She's incredibly busty and wears barely anything. Her two pieces of clothing are a short red robe that drops down just below her crotch and some black underwear. But don't think that we found out what her underwear looks like because we specifically tried to (ok, we did that once), but because the game practically shoves it in your face. You couldn't miss it if you tried.   When we looked up at the sky the camera slid right underneath Kurenai, letting her lose any shred of dignity she might have had. Crawl under a building and the camera zooms right up her backside. You almost get the feeling that that's the main attribute of the game and you wouldn't be too far off the mark for believing so, either. After all, it's one of the ways she kills the enemies in the game.   One of Kurenai's skills in Red Ninja is the ability to trick men into coming over to her so that she can kill them. This is done by showing a little leg out from behind a wall so that a guard will walk over and can then be taken out stealthily. It's a trick that's a little funny the first time, but after doing it a coupe of dozen times it's more than old. It's really kind of sad that a game would resort to the idea of a hot and sexy ninja that kills with her feminine wiles and leave the rest of the game as an undeveloped mess.   It's hard to look at the rest of Red Ninja and find just one underdeveloped detail to look at first. There are just so many to choose from. The first offender is the camera system which can swing wildly about and the biggest problem with any wall or other object that it gets near. It still ahs no problem showing off Kurenai's attributes, but that's about it.   When we can see Kurenai, the lack of polish in her own movement is just as disheartening. When running around normally she leaves a funny little motion blur even though it's not like she's all that fast. Her jumps are also quick movements where it feels like she has an even speed going all the way up and down. When not killing the guards and other people in the game, Kurenai has plenty of platforming and exploring to do, but with the clumsy controls this becomes a tiresome chore.   One of Kurenai's abilities is running along walls. But where other games like Prince of Persia: Warrior Within have used wall-running with a set distance and a set animation for a predictable control, Red Ninja provides for analog control of Kurenai as she starts getting up the walls. This sounds cool at first since it requires more skill. The downside is that the running is pretty fast and the control is pretty much terrible. This leads to plenty of chances to fall down on the ground again and again.    Of course, there are many other things to look at. There are the graphical glitches, the mediocre storyline, the basic bosses, and the options menu that only offers the ability to turn vibration on or off. But that's assuming that this game is worth spending much, if any, time playing through. Many of the challenges in the game are not trying to figure out what the intended challenges are, but to make the game work like it should've in the first place.  Red Ninja is a comedy of errors, but without the humor. From the camera to the movement to the over-powered tetsugen to the uninspired nature of pretty much everything this game disappoints in so many different ways. If this was a movie it's quite possible it could become a camp classic. As a game there's no reason at all to put yourself through this whatsoever.", "date": "Mar 30, 2005"}
