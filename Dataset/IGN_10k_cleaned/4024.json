If you don't believe us, take a look at our glowing Viewtiful Joe review. Most of the stuff from the Mega Man camp is usually blessed with a magical touch.    We remember being all amped when we heard Capcom was in the process of developing a cel-shaded racing game that had a lot of Initial D influence. That was a few years back.    We weren't so excited when we finally got behind the wheel of said game on the Japanese PlayStation 2. Actually, we were very disappointed. Yeah, the game looked good enough, but its play mechanics in no way matched its visuals.   It didn't end there, though -- Capcom promised the control would be revised for the American release. The anguish continued when we got our grubby little hands on the American PS2 version and the control was actually worse than it was before. The fact that Capcom added a few cars didn't make much of a difference. Its online component was barely enough to make it a total dog.   The shock continued when Capcom announced that it would release the lackluster racer on the GameCube. Gone would be the online play, but at least we'd get progressive scan mode.    The Facts  Cel Shaded visuals  Tuner-built rides  Car customization system   2-Player Simultaneous (split-screen)  Memory Card (40 Blocks)  Progressive Scan Compatible   Gameplay  Auto Modellista GCN feels as if it doesn't actually have four-point physics, but single-point physics. That is, cars in AM don't feel as if they're reacting to the contact patch from four wheels, but a single contact patch possibly under the car.   In the end it makes the vehicles feel as if they're just under the mercy of bad physics. Also, the physics don't seem to have any sort of variance from the Z-axis, it's strictly a two-dimensional physics model. Your car will never bounce, catch air or show any significant weight transfer -- even when you drive over some rumble strips.    Good control can make a huge difference when you have bad physics. But do we really have to tell you that Capcom didn't get this part of the game right? The revised control actually feels even worse than it did in the original Japanese version. Every car, no matter which one, feels like it wants to slide at all times. There is no sense of traction or true grip racing in this slide-fest.    It's really frustrating to try to tackle a corner and see a vehicle's ass-end come out even when you're doing everything right. And let's say that you really do want to try some drift-style driving; well, that isn't done right, either. Try to drift in a turn and you'll wind up spinning nine times out of ten. And on the rare occasion that you do a perfect counter-steer and slide right you'll lose all power to the wheels and come to an almost complete halt.   Who thought up this stuff? We haven't cursed so much in years -- it's just that tedious and makes even the uber-simplistic GT Cube feel a million times more satisfying.     Doug Perry of our sister-site IGNPS2 summed it up well in his review of the PS2 version, ~I personally spent more than 10 hours playing this game, beat it, and never really ever enjoyed the ~style~ of control. More specifically, I never enjoyed the control even when I began winning. The controls are without a doubt the game's biggest sticking point, and they'll probably push more gamers away than attract them.    Then again, there is no doubt that the painfully-earned skill one earns by learning to play it, and once you do get good, you'll probably love Auto Modellista.~ We don't exactly agree with his 7.0 rating, but that, undoubtedly, has to do with the online component -- making it go from a mediocre game to a mediocre title with online play.   Graphics  We can't say much that hasn't already been said about AM's unusual (at least for a car game) graphics. Why Capcom chose cel-shading is unknown. But it does separate the game from the hundreds of other games out there.    The GameCube does look better than the PS2 version thanks to progressive scan mode. The scissoring issue seen in the PS2 version also seems to have been remedied. Polys no longer drop out when you get too close to the opposition.    Other minor stuff like textures and what not seem like carry-over from the PS2, but do look better. Still, we would have hoped that Capcom would have retouched the textures and maybe improved on some of the effects seen within the game.     Sound  As if that damned, over-the-top announcer wasn't bad enough in Marvel Versus Capcom 2 we have to listen to his awful overacting in this game, too. Maybe Capcom wanted to have the same feel that Namco accomplished with Ridge Racer V. Sorry to say it failed miserably the guy does nothing for the game and just serves to annoy the hell out of us anytime we play the game.    The musical selection is as equally offensive. It's that same jazzy crap we heard in MVC2. It's just nasty stuff that has no business in a racing game or any game at all, for that matter. What AM needs is some hard thumping trance or just J-Pop dance. Think Initial D for a better idea. We generally turn of the mediocre tunes and try to make due with the plain engine sounds which aren't as genuine as, let's say, GT or even Need for Speed Underground  Since I can remember I've been a Capcom whore. And I wanted to like AM badly, but in the end I'm left with a sour taste. It looks okay, has some nice cars and visual effects, but the most important aspect of this game is missing -- the control mechanics are seriously unrefined. Sure, try to convince me that this is a ~drifting~ game. Maybe that will convince me that the control isn't beyond help. Honestly, control is always what makes or breaks a game; in this case it's done the latter. I'm really sad, too, because this could be a nice sideways, sliding romp with some cool cars. A bit of advice Capcom, kill the announcer--he should have been shot after MVC2 and fire the tuning designer, too. Get someone in there who can fix the damn control.", "date": "Oct 16, 2003"}
