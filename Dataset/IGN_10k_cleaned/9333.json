Max Fleischer created the character in the 1930s and she's never left that era. Perhaps that's her charm: though cartoon characters come, characters go, and the ones that stick around evolve to keep up with the current ages and trends. But hey, if they can name a diner in San Francisco after her, why not put her in a videogame as well? Destination Software's Betty Boop Double Shift isn't much more than a clone of Diner Dash, a game that already shipped on the DS several months ago. The game's a challenge if you stick with it, but this game isn't nearly as good as its inspiration.   If you've played Diner Dash or Cake Mania, you know exactly what you're getting with Betty Boop Double Shift. This Black Lantern-developed title rips off these concepts wholesale (which weren't all that original to begin with) by putting Betty Boop in the role of waitress managing customers wandering in for a milkshake or piece of candy. First you'll need to wait for their order, then send their order through: if they order a milkshake, the color will appear on their table. Make sure you deliver the Red/Yellow pair of shakes to the Red/Yellow table, for example. If they want a piece of candy, same thing: pick it up and take it to their table. The challenge is to manage the demand of a full restaurant and handle requests of six demanding groups by quickly tapping the locations to make Boop move from table to table.   The visual style attempts to match the Max Fleischer designs and does so pretty well. Anthropomorphic wolves and frogs as well as lankey humans pop in for milkshakes and candy, all the while the upbeat jazz soundtrack plays in the background. Problem is, the animation is the pits: there's barely a half dozen variations of the character poses, and they're not very exaggerated when they change from one pose to the next. This makes it difficult to immediately see when a table needs attention, since their ~hand up~ pose blends in with their normal ~sitting at the table~ positiona problem that increases as you earn more tables to manage.   She doesn't look a day over 70.   The reason this game isn't nearly as good as Diner Dash - and is ultimately a flawed game - is its use of logic on the player. About halfway through the levels the game puts an additional element on the player: song requests. The band can play three different tunes, but only one at a time. So if a table requests a ~red~ song, no problem. But if a second table requests a ~yellow~ song, there's nothing the player can do since you can't cue up songs to play - once the band's playing  a song you can't request any more until they're done. Which means the customers will get pissed off and leaveand other than a one-time-only ~smart bomb~ kiss that makes customers immediately happy, players can't combat the flaw of multiple song requests.   And then, there's the absolutely awful ~rhythm~ game that appears at the end of every level. To get a last minute cash grab to complete a level, players enter into a dance game where they'll tap musical notes to the music playing in the background. But apparently the programmers actually forgot to put in the ~rhythm~ element: all that's required is tapping the notes at your discretion...as fast or as slow as you want. It's absolutely impossible to lose these challenges and makes them a complete waste of time.Betty Boop Double Shift is clearly another ~cheap, recognizable character~ license that Destination scooped up, and then quickly applied someone else's game design to the property. If the game understood what makes Diner Dash and Cake Mania good then this might've scored higher, but its flawed design Makes Betty Boop a DS ~oops.~", "date": "Oct 26, 2007"}
