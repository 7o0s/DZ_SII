Followed by ~100% race feeling guaranteed! GTR is the most realistic racing simulation ever!~ At least they cannot be accused of modesty. But this isn't the first time we've seen boasts like this, and it certainly won't be the last. Still, one has to admire them for having the guts to hang it all out like this.   The motto of the developers of GTR Racing may as well be ~If you want something done right, do it yourself.~ This was the attitude that a group of racing sim fans took a couple of years ago when they created a GT Car mod for EA's F1 Challenge Racing sim. The same bunch of guys has now gone ~commercial~ and has released the fully FIA-licensed GTR Simulation under the Publisher 10tacle Studios. Finally, these modders have received the backing needed to secure the official licenses and support of the FIA GT Racing teams.   The premise for this title is not complicated. There is no ~Car-PG~ aspect to this title, no career mode, no 500 cars to collect. This game is nothing more and nothing less than a hardcore simulation of the FIA GT Racing series.  Some efforts have been made to cater to the ~average gamer~ with Arcade and Semi-Pro modes, but the game's true focus is the hard-to-please realism fanatic, with no punches pulled. The list of people that created this game includes the SimBin president, who competes in this racing series in real life; physics experts with real life tuning and racing resumes from America; and many people who have spent years making mods for popular racing sims, spread all over the world. Even the telemetry in the game is real, coming from the MoTec Company and using its actual Windows analysis software with the game, fed data by the game's high-fidelity physics engine.    Assuming that you've read the words ~telemetry~ and ~hardcore simulation~ in the previous paragraph and are still reading, I'll assume this game was meant for you--the person who is hungry for the next simulation worthy of comparison with the venerable Grand Prix Legends.   If you have played EA's F1 Challenge, you were playing a game built upon the ImageSpace physics and graphics engines. The creators of GTR carried the idea of modding F1 Challenge further, this time licensing the engine directly from ImageSpace and building GTR directly on top of it, changing all the physics pieces to mimic the behavior of the GTR cars.  The sounds were sampled directly from the cars and carry over beautifully onto the PC.  3D cockpit views are fully implemented and seem to accurately reflect the big differences between each car type, and TrackIR support is implemented. So if you are fortunate enough to own that peripheral, you can turn your head to look around in the car and, more importantly, into the corners as you approach them. As someone who DOES own a TrackIR, I'm very pleased with the support for it in this title, and don't know how I could go back to driving without it.      The Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Corvettes, Vipers, and Saleens are all here, along with cars like the Lotus Elise.  Each real-life team's livery for their car has been created, and you can choose any of them. The FIA GT Tracks are all included here, including popular F1 tracks like Spa-Francorchamps, Silverstone, Barcelona, and Monza. You'll also see some of the tracks you might have previously seen in MotoGP or Touring Car games, like Brno, Estoril, Anderstorp and Oschersleben. Spa even has dawn and evening versions as well as sunlight versions to support both short races during those times, and it supports 24 hour endurance races.    On the downside, you'll wait a long time for tracks to load. Maybe not quite long enough to pop off for a snack, but definitely enough to make you strongly consider it. You may have to make do with fiddling with your monitor's contrast and brightness settings impatiently. As always, the speed of your hardware will determine just how much foot tapping you do.   Once the thing finally loads, you'll see that the job that was done on the cars and tracks is excellent. While the graphics don't seem quite as polished as they are in games like NASCAR Sim Racing, they are excellent nonetheless. At full detail, they look slightly grittier than the smoother graphics of EA's title. And you may have to compromise some of that by tweaking the many available options to get the frame rate you need for precise control.   I spent some time in both the Arcade modes and the Semi-Pro modes before proceeding to the full-blown Simulation mode, to get a feel for the racing action without having to spend many hours just getting around the track without wrecking. The Arcade mode relaxes the physics model quite a bit, but you still get the throaty roar of the GT engines and you get to see just how sweet the AI is in this game. Unlike many other games out there, the AI actually drives believably, unlike the AI disaster that is Gran Turismo. When I braked too early, they didn't slam into me. They braked hard as well to avoid contact, yet when I missed the apex by a car width, there was a good chance they would seize the opportunity to slip by underneath.  If I had the inside line on a corner but was going significantly slower than they were, they would actually pass me on the outside, but not force their way through if I was still in front of them as I exited the turn.  There is an AI aggression level you can set within the game, with the most natural choice being ~Real.~ If some of the online racers I see would drive a little more like the AI, many races would not turn into wreck fests.  I do believe this is the best AI if you value racing hard and yet racing clean.    In Arcade mode, you pay for the forgiving driving model with a reduced top speed. As you progress to more difficult challenges, you'll find that your skill allows you to beat the AI cars in the slower, twistier sections of circuits, while your limited top speed will allow them to pass you back on the straights. I found this behavior a little odd. The only explanation I can think of is that the makers of GTR are trying to make sure that Arcade players are not the ones posting the best lap times on the Internet. Initially, when you aren't very good, the arcade mode is fun and challenging.  But it quickly runs out of gas, and you'll need to move up to Semi-Pro or Simulation mode.   Even in the latter modes, some driver assistance for things like anti-lock braking and stability and traction control are available, if the absolute realism is just too hard for you to control. There's no doubt that more casual gamers can enjoy the arcade modes for the sheer fun of racing, at least for awhile.   Once you get into Simulation mode, unless you have a natural talent that lets you pull off hot laps on par with the AI (and real life), you'll need to crank down the AI difficulty to something closer to your level. Anticipating, based upon past experience, that I might regularly go off course or make other mistakes, I set the AI at its lowest value (90%). At this pace, using the setups provided in the game, I was able to get competitive fairly quickly, and started slowly but cautiously increasing the AI difficulty as my competence increased.   At a certain point, even if you are not a garage guru, you will find the need to go into the garage, if only to switch from one provided setup to another. Here you will find a gem in the game: the online setup browser. For the first time I've seen in a racing sim, you don't have to go web crawling looking for fan sites where good setups have been contributed. You can directly download online setups from within the garage. The setups are organized in an online folder structure, and each setup has been rated by those who have downloaded and tried it out. This allows you to choose from a very large number of setups. This will give you a jump start on tuning, as you might be able to compare the settings provided by default with the ones that the online hotshoes are using. And it would be worth your while to do so if you intend to go online to race, which brings us to the next category: multiplayer.     Online multiplayer is available in each mode in the game, even in Arcade mode. This is where you'll quickly discover, if you've played EA's F1 or NASCAR sims lately, that this feels like the same multiplayer code as in those products. There is not much lag effect minimization code here. Whereas with NASCAR Sim Racing, EA's Tiburon team worked very hard on the multiplayer code to allow cars to drive inches apart without intolerable warping, GTR feels like it could still use some time in the development garage. Even when picking servers with very low pings, racing in several pickup races online still rendered a fair amount of car hopping from lag. In one particularly memorable race, I had strayed off course, allowing an online opponent to get by. His lag was just enough to force me to stay behind him, simply because I could not tell where his car would really be on the track from one moment to the next.   If GTR's goal is to be the Grand Prix Legends of GT titles, then multiplayer is going to need some work. I think this is where the ~mod-based~ nature of the development team shows up. It is very unclear to me how much, if any, serious coding was done for the game. It seems like the new tracks, cars, and physics engine changes were bolted on top of the licensed ImageSpace engine, and thus the multiplayer was not much improved over the EA F1 series, which was always troublesome in this regard. (I personally feel this contributed to the discontinuation of EA's F1 series of titles). Great online play has a way of selling games, and with uninspiring Internet gaming performance, the burden of replayability falls largely onto the single player AI, and it's fortunate that this part was very well implemented.   The developers' confidence in their physics model is so high that they were actually able to work out a deal with MoTec to stream data from the physics engine into MoTec software analysis, and allow you to actually use the same Windows software that race teams use to analyze telemetry.  This software collects more data than most users will ever be able to understand or utilize, and there are a few areas in the MoTec UI where blank screens come up because the simulation doesn't capture them. However, all the things you typical would want to know are buried in here--if you can traverse the UI, which is by no means obvious. Guidance from the manual includes a link to the MoTec web site, if you feel like trying to find help from there. The main useful element of the MoTec software to me was the track map showing colored bands indicating my throttle position.  I could easily find where I was too tentative, perhaps even coasting when I should not be. For setup changes, however, it is a bit harder to use than software found in games like EA's F1 and NASCAR sims.      Once you get into the garage, every conceivable setup option is available to you. There's nothing here that I haven't seen before in the most detailed modern F1 sims, so if you are familiar with adjusting caster, camber, damper, springs, roll bars, etc you will feel right at home here. If you find yourself glazing over when staring at one of these screens, you just need to look online, find a saved setup that works for you, and drive the wheels off of it.   Once you get past the serious learning curve for handling these cars when driving at the limit, you will start to feel capable of racing against opponents. It took me several hours of practice by myself on the track to feel ready to take on full simulation competition at any kind of difficulty level. I was not sorry I did all that practice. Since the game also allows you to scale mechanical failures, and fuel and tire usage, I was able to run a shorter race that still had a fair amount of pitting and tire wear. Unfortunately for me, my car erupted in flames while I was leading the race with only four laps to go. Fortunately for me, five other cars had dropped out with various failures before me!  If you find yourself wanting super realistic cars, you may want to tweak these options to your liking.   The replay system is both wonderful and agonizing. There is no doubt that the cars and tracks are beautiful to watch on saved replays. Unfortunately, even when saving replays at their highest fidelity, there tends to be some jerkiness in the replay that has nothing to do with frame rates. Perhaps it DOES have to do with the hardware, so your mileage may vary, but it was a little distracting to see cars twitching and even putting their nose into the ground for a frame here and there. Still, the overall quality of the replays is high, and the cars, right down to the driver visibly leaning into the corners, look great.   If all this weren't enough to satisfy your craving for a realistic GT Racing sim, there's also the fact that SimBin has been adding goodies on the web. They have added an oval track pack for free download to registered users, and who knows what other tracks or goodies may be forthcoming. If there's one thing that modders like to do, it's create or convert tracks! And it shows. Even with what's in the box, the path to mastery is going to be long and entertaining, and this title should enjoy a very long life for people who just need to find that next 10th of a second on their lap times.    ~Welcome to the most authentic racing simulation ever!~ was the claim. I didn't find anything in this title to allow me to dispute this claim. There is no doubt that GTR will satisfy the cravings of the hardcore sim fan looking for a GT racing series simulation. The physics are exquisitely good and, with some practice, begin to feel quite natural. The AI races hard but clean and even makes mistakes. No corners have been cut when it comes to depth and features, and only a slightly dated graphics engine and unimpressive lag handling in multiplayer prevent the sim from doing a slingshot pass of Grand Prix Legends or NASCAR Racing 2003. Overall, it's easily worth every penny spent. The game lives up to its boasts of realism, and puts many more 'traditional' publishers' efforts to shame. Fanatical hardcore racing nuts built this title, and it shows in every detail. It just needs a little polish and multiplayer coding to put it over the top.", "date": "Jun 14, 2005"}
