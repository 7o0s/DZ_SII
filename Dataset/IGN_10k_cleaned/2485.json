While lacking top-tier graphics and a flashy presentation, High Heat 2003 proves to be an enormously good baseball game. And it also appears the developers read IGN's review of last year's version and came through with a key hit Luis Gonzalez-style. This year 3DO added two modes we cried for, Batting Practice and Home Run Derby. The developers also came through with a marquee new play mode, 2-on-2 Showdown. Exhibition, Season, All-Star Game and Playoffs round out the play modes.   As with last year, the game speed can adjusted from slowest, to slow, normal, fast or fastest. While the defaults are close to perfect in most aspects for most players, the speed of a fastball can be adjusted, as can the velocity of a non-fastball, the running speed of fielders and base runners or the rate fielders throw the ball to a base. Basically, if grounders are too easy to leg out, slow down the runners or increase the pace of throws. I think the game plays a tad better if you consider yourself a veteran baseball gamer when the speed of fastballs and non-fastball is bumped up two notches, but not all the way.   High Heat 2003 also has five difficulty levels: Rookie, Pro, All-Star, MVP and Hall of Fame. But you can also delve into those as well. Adjusting the ability and power of the CPU hitters as well as the players you control gives the game almost infinite complexity.   Feature Set The 2-on-2 Showdown mode is a brilliant addition. It's basically a mini-game that can be used as batting practice or, better yet, a new drinking game. The mode pits pitcher against batter for two innings. So you pitch for two half-innings and hit for two. You pick your team and your pitcher and batter on that club who you want to use for the entire two-inning slugfest.   While pitching you get one point for a strike and one for an out. A foul tip is basically a do-over. Batters tally one point for having a good eye and taking a ball. Two points are earned per single, three for a double, four for a triple and five for a dinger. You don't actually run the bases and there's no fielding so it's a fast-paced pitcher-batter experience. The AI determines what would have happened with each ball hit in play as it does in Batting Practice mode. Pull one down the line and you will likely be awarded a double. Ground one hard up the middle, watch the pitcher clumsily dodge it you'll be awarded two points for one base. A Texas leaguer will also earn you one bag, but roll one to the wall in the gap and you'll get the elusive four-point triple.   The enjoyable dynamic here is trying to get someone out. This mode is fun only two or three times against the CPU, but really shines with a friend or in a group. You can't throw too many balls or a skilled batter will learn to lay off and earn his points by just watching. However, because the same batter is used for six consecutive outs it's easy to get into a hitting rhythm. Mixing up pitches and locations, but mostly for strikes, is the way to go.   The season can be customized in more ways than a Wendy's burger. Games can be anywhere from one to nine innings. Assuming you're thinking ahead, you can change the length of the playoff rounds and World Series to a best of one, three, five or seven. You can play with or without an All-Star game at mid-season. And if your overestimated the time you need to play all those games at nine innings, you can bump down the innings per game after you begin.   Home Run Derby was a nice addition, but it's too easy to knock them out. And why the hell can't Barry Bonds blast one into McCovey Cove? The ball travels far enough to hit what San Francisco Giants fans affectionately call Bond's Pond, but it's not shown. Show me the splash.   Gameplay Let an ESPN announcer tell you the exact percentage, but the vast majority of baseball occurs between the pitcher and batter. This is where High Heat 2003 stands a foot taller than all competitors on all platforms ever. According to Game Reviewer's Code #468-2.4, which states we can never let bad advertising campaigns die gracefully, I'm required to tell you ~It's sooo reeeeeal~ somewhere in this review.   As seen in other games, you don't have to put some arc-shaped swing area near where the ball is going to hit. You also don't have to plop your swing target on top of the pitcher's throw target. This isn't a carnival. It's professional baseball.   You simply see the ball spinning your way and choose to lay off or to swing and aim by using the D-pad. If you swing too early, then big, and sometimes embarrassing, text will tell read ~swung too early.~ If your aim is way off, you'll be told. You can also pick from a nice variety of batting camera angles. The default on the version we received is low zoomed. It was too much of a worm's eye view for me, so I changed it to low. You also have medium, high, side and pitcher. But since you have to aim your swing left or up and right it's easier to hit with one of medium, low or low zoomed.   Fielding takes a few innings to get used to. When a line drive is hit you are given control of the infielder who may or may not have a chance at the ball. You have to learn to wait a second and prepare to move your outfielder. When a reviewer must get picky to find flaws that should tell you something.    Graphics Something is rotten in the state of Pac Bell Park. Ok, so it's not actually that bad. The ballparks look like their real-world counterparts. In other words, the stadiums are recognizable beyond doubt even without logos to aid your guess. The players look vaguely as they do in person or on TV. It's just the animations. They'll show you more chops than a Japanese steakhouse chef.   When a player dives back to a base avoid a pitcher's throwback, the baserunner gets up and dusts himself off. Unfortunately it looks more like King Kong beating his chest. Either the player is cocky in an Albert Belle sort of way or the animation is poorly done. The framerate is also quite low for players running or throwing. View a replay once for proof.    Sound   The play-by-play announcer and color commentator are sufficient for maybe two or three games, but then their tendencies become mildly irksome. As with most sports games, the announcers are more enjoyable during two-player games because you make fun of them with a friend.   The one that bugged me was the play-by-play man saying things twice. He would point out that ball four had just occurred and then while the batter was jogging to first base he'd say that a base was being taken as a result of four balls. That's straight from the department of redundancy department.   The in-game sounds fared quite a bit better. The thwack of the ball being driven to center field sounds like it does at a Major League game. As does the ball when it snaps into a player's glove. The crowd cheers blend in and are adequate. Go out and buy this game. On the way home get disappointed by looking at the screenshots on the back of the case. Then you will be forced to love this game for how well it plays. If you like baseball games, this is absolutely the one to own. If you like sports games in general, this will rival any other title in the genre unless you have ever listed MCI Center, Ralph Wilson Stadium or the clubhouse at Pebble Beach as your house of worship. There's not a play mode I could ask for, but I would enjoy if 3DO beefed up the aesthetics so they were not snicker-inducing.", "date": "Feb 14, 2002"}
