Actually, the level of homage in Raving Rabbids is pretty high. Loops, pole swinging, ziplines, and bouncing around enemy bosses doesn't get much more Hedgehog-y. Thankfully, pigs and plunger guns manage to help make the distinction. Those, and the zaniest bad guys you've seen in a video game in a long, long time.   The real stars of this Rayman are the Rabbids, a species of crazed bunnies with twitchy eyes, Pillsbury Doughboy bodies, and a pair of buck teeth that would look right at home on an extra from ~Deliverance.~ They have silly faces and sillier animations. This better not be the last time we see them, because they are awesome creations.   It's a good thing these goofball bunnies are so cool, because Rayman Raving Rabbids is a brisk game that doesn't last more than an hour or so. By the time you feel like things have really hit full stride, the eighth level is over and you're left wanting more. While that's definitely a better emotion to go out on than, say, resentment, it's still something of a downer, especially following Gameloft's lengthier Tropical Madness.   At no point does the game stand still. Every scene introduces new game mechanics, such as running along walls like the Prince of Persia or stepping into a wind gust and being blown through a line of stars. (You collect stars in Rayman like Sonic collects rings.) Tom-tom drums bounce you through the air. You slide down dunes on a pirate hat. Flying rings whisk you through the air. Rayman can also ride a pig in high-speed scenes. (The pig even jumps through a hoop of fire. That's fun in any language.) Each world ends in a massive boss battle of the ~figure out the pattern~ variety.   Between these bursts of crazy motion, Raving Rabbids is very much a 16-bit side-scroller, featuring all the twisting loops and run-and-jump platforming you found in Sonic and Donkey Kong Country. Fire traps must be avoided. Moving platforms must be negotiated. At moments like these, you could switch out Rayman for Sonic and/or DK without blinking an eye.   Rayman employs a variety of attacks to dispense with the Rabbids. The limbless hero can engage in fisticuffs to fend off Rabbids that get too close for comfort. Later, these punches become full-fledged Rayman-fu. Rayman also picks up two weapons. First, you find a plunger gun that pops Rabbids right in the kisser from a safe distance. The air pump inflates the bunnies, making them look even sillier than normal.   This is one of Gameloft's most beautiful games to date. It's full of lush, blue-sky vistas now rarely found in today's grittier gaming world. The hand-drawn sprites and color selection are fantastic. Running along the fish-shaped windsocks? Stunning. The animations are wonderful, especially when dealing with some of the goofier Rabbids or employing the plunger gun and air pump.   My only real complaint about Rayman Raving Rabbids is the length. The game does have three difficulty levels and there were definitely moments that demanded replay (Pirate Rabbids!), but the relative shorter length of a single run-through might turn off a lot of gamers. This might be one of those games you buy on subscription, kinda like Gameloft's equally brisk, but also very cinematically compelling Mission: Impossible III. In the end, though, I have to laud the game for offering fantastic action and excellent art direction. This may join Super KO Boxing, Tower Bloxx, and Rollercoaster Rush as games I keep at the ready when dealing with mobile gaming skeptics.", "date": "Nov 27, 2006"}
