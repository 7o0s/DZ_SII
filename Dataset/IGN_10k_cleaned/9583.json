Hours of boring exercises and outdated videos can make each class a tedious chore. Luckily times have changed, and now there's a more entertaining and sure way to learn a language. Just play with your DS.   Ubisoft's My Spanish Coach and My French Coach both manage to embody the better parts of discovering a language thanks to a few clever tricks. Instead of mind-numbing drills, the developers created eight different activities designed to help you learn vocabulary, sentence structure and verb conjunction.    Give a hoot. Whack a mole.   Before you dive into your lessons, you'll be given a placement test that determines what level of French or Spanish you're currently at. If you're fairly advanced, you'll skip to the higher lessons. If you're a noob, you'll start from the beginning. As you progress you'll learn how to properly conjugate verbs, memorize vocabulary and improve your pronunciation. Once you've completed fifty levels, the game offers you an open plan scenario, where you're no longer taught anything but can still opt to memorize random words from the game's massive dictionary (there are 10,000 words in all).    By far the most helpful feature is the compare option. This allows you to listen to how a word is properly pronounced, and then allows you to record your own voice and compare it with the native speaker. Hearing yourself speak makes you realize how you ridiculous you sound to a native speaker and correct your wayward accent accordingly. You can even slow down the speaker's voice if you can't catch everything, which is a good thing since longer sentences can be hard to catch.    Listen to how stupid you sound.   All of this makes for a great learning experience, but readers should be aware the games are not flawless.  For example, the native speaker sometimes uses colloquial phrases that don't match up to the words on the screen. There are also different words that have the same meaning but aren't taught together, creating a bit of confusion. The most disspointing thing is that you don't get to learn future or past tense in the game, which is strange since the former starts to appear at random in the games without explanation.   There's also not much to say about the music and graphics. The music is catchy but repetitive and the graphics are cute but nothing to write home about. Since the focus is on learning this can be somewhat overlooked, but it's still a little disappointing. Luckily the game makes up for it by utilizing the DS stylus very well. While amusing yourself with games like Hit-A-Word and Spelltastic, you'll tap the screen, point and drag words, and even be able to use a sketch pad to draw objects or practice your spelling.In short, My Spanish Coach and My French Coach both deliver what they promise, which is to teach you the basics of a language in a fast and fun manner. And although you won't be able to talk politics or make a presentation to the U.N. in either language, you'll be able to order top-shelf tequila with your escargot.
