{"name": "Rugrats in Paris", "name_review": "Rugrats in Paris -- The Movie", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/05/rugrats-in-paris-the-movie", "text": "Every other Rugrats game has been a load of dirty diapers -- graphics that broke up like a porcelain doll, gameplay and level design that worked about as well as dried Playdoh, and control that felt like a tack in your footy PJ's. Why should this one be any different?  The question you really want to ask is why shouldn't it? These babies have been around longer than Britney Spears, and they have much better music too (hey, between Swede-pop kiddy lech versions of Rolling Stones tunes, or a Mark Mothersbaugh freak-out, which planet would you rather visit?) Some might even say they're cuter. These are big, big babies, and they should have games that roll along with them.  Finally, THQ is offering a little more than lukewarm water in this baby bottle -- Rugrats in Paris has more fun in one of it's mini-games that all the other Rugrats games on every other system combined. Alright, maybe that's not saying much, since most of the old Rugrats games actually managed to pack in negative fun, but it's a start. Gameplay Lost alone in the great big theme park Euroreptarland -- it's Disneyland with the main mouse as a fifty-foot Godzilla monster and more prominence give to the ever-important icons of ninjas and boogers -- the Rugrats are having the times of their lives. They're toddlers, so the time of their lives happens about once an hour, but being free in a great big amusement park sure seems like a dream come true.  Somewhere in this great big park are mini-games with a bushel of tickets to win one of the most coveted prizes ever -- a helmet that can be used to control the gigantic Reptar! So off these tots go in search of the crown, and in these mini-games is the bulk of the gameplay. THQ has tried this mini-game formula before many times with Rugrats, but the problem has always been that the games were as much fun as a time-out in the corner.   Surprisingly, a good half of these games are now hoots and hollers of joy with a better game engine and some more creativity.  Chuckie Chan is probably one of the silliest and most fun games out there for little kids -- it's a fake fighter game, with boards that come to life ala The Sorcerer's Apprentice and attack, and Chuckie has to use goofy baby kung fu to take these ninja blockheads out. It's button mashing, it's stupidly easy, it's crazy and corny -- it's perfect for kids.  The same goes for many of the games in this adventure -- they're average, but can be fun to play and bubbling with little creative touches for kids. For instance, for some unknown reason -- a reason that makes perfect sense when I think about it like a kindergartner -- the park is crawling with meanie ninjas to battle and defeat. In the Bumper Cars games, ninjas are behind the wheel. In the Cookie Toss, ninjas are the target of cookie throwing stars. There's even a Whack-A-Ninja game.  Unfortunately, as the games have gotten better and the visual engine has gotten out of the way before it breaks the game, the designers of Rugrats still have a lot to learn about making games for kids. It's a problem of the while industry right now, and with the PlayStation becoming little sister's system while big bro goes PS2, it's going to get worse until somebody figures out that kids don't like to fail. They like to think they're winners, even when the gameplay steers and cheats for them to win.  And that problem comes along in Rugrat's mini-game challenges. The limbo bar is often set too low for babies just learning to walk. These are such easy games at the base level, but the challenge level to succeed is unfair -- why ramp up the difficulty like that? There is a difficulty adjustment, but somebody older would have to set it up for young players, and it's originally set too hard. Even on the easiest setting, it doesn't do much to make the game fair to little kids -- doesn't hitting 16 out of 20 moving targets seem a bit demanding for a five-year-old?  The Mini-Golf game (which was it's entire own game before and stunk, now somewhat fun to play with working graphics but poopie physics) still expects a four-year-old to make par in three putts. That's not fair to somebody who hardly understands what they're doing, especially since the golf puts are tough to aim, have untrustworthy physics, and often start off facing the wrong way from the hole. Why not at least point me at the big gator's mouth before telling me to go ahead and putt?  There's some screwy things that are part of this game that should be more fun. The difficulty level is one. The multiplayer is another -- why have a crazy bumper car game if you can't drive around and bump a friend? Instead, players trade turns in the mini-games. Instructions for how to play mini-games is told outside of the game itself, and only if the player goes up to an instruction kiosk, so if a mini-game baffles them and they need to see what button to hit, players need to quit out (and face a long load time), go to the instruction panel, then get back into the game (another load). And failing to score in a mini-game kicks you out to the main level (with yet another load) -- why not just let kids try again while they feel like playing more, before they fall asleep for a nap in the load time.  Graphics We didn't actually think it would happen when we suggested the last few times, but THQ has gone ahead and added something to this Rugrats game that's been missing in the last few outings. It's something called a ~frame rate~, and ohh, what a world of difference it makes. While the big park hacks and wheezes like Grandpa after the Superbowl, the places where there's gameplay run smooth. It's sort of fun -- they should do this more.  Now equipped with this elusive 'frame rate,' Rugrats invites young players to explore a vast land of Euroreptarland. Unfortunately, there are no people in Reptarland besides the babies themselves -- a very eerie phenomenon that would scare most kids if it happened for real -- so there's nobody to interact with or have fun with outside the games themselves. Too bad, since the empty park is creepy alone, but at least there's a mile of amusement park land to explore, including a city made out of boogers and a ninja dojo.  The visuals, in a bizarre new turn of events, seem ported from the N64 model, rather than the other way around as it's been since the fun machine came out. The graphics are beautifully colorful and brimming with details, but the engine has shaky textures, break-up, and all other manner of polygon errors. Still, most kids won't care when there's ninjas to battle. I only wish there were more interactive elements or surprises -- the game world is so vast and players have to travel a very, very long way to do anything, all the while constantly hunting down red tickets. You'd think there would be something special around some of the corners, like people in the bathrooms or magical rooms of machines running if you sneak through a door down a corridor -- instead, there's just bad glitching because the game engine can't handle corridors or corners. Sound You can't go wrong with the music of Mark Mothersbaugh, the evo of Devo who composed the theme for the Rugrats series. Those tinkling flutes and croaky voices are more recognizable than the 'rats themselves, and they're brought to life well by the music team on this game. The tracks are recomposed and added, with constant tangents and transposed rhythms, and it all works well.  And you can't go wrong with the voices of the Rugrats, those darling babies of screens big and small -- actually, you can go wrong with these instantly charming voices, if the resolution of the voices is down low and the mixing is shaky. Sadly, the sound team missed the mark in this game, and while kids' games are usually brimming with audio brilliance, this one needs to be potted down. Understanding the babies when they speak is near impossible from the ressed out vocal tracks. And the sound effects are laughable and limited when they're not glitching out -- Reptar's menacing roar sounds like a $12 Reptar doll with a pull string.      Tommy, Chuckie, Angelica, and the rest still make the hairs on the back of my neck stand every time they sneak up on me with a new videogames, but this one rolled like a stroller with only one wheel loose -- not bad, considering all the other Rugrats games played like square wheels. There's still some blockheaded things that have gone wrong in this game, but on the whole, Avalanche has stepped up to give some flavor to this baby food.", "date": "Dec 5, 2000"}
