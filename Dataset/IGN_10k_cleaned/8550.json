This is a Nintendo DS game that's aimed at him. As good and pick-up-and-play as I believe this game is, I have to ask myself: would my dad, a man who's incredibly blas towards videogames, play and enjoy New York Times Crosswords? I'll have to wait until later this summer to gauge the real reaction, but my gut tells me that the answer is a ~yes, but...~   The ~yes~ is due to the fact that New York Times Crosswords is exactly what it sets out to be: an archive of a thousand crossword puzzles from the New York Times, reproduced on the Nintendo DS in compact form. The touch screen's used both to navigate the puzzle by dragging it around the display as well as activating each hint and letter box. Filling in each box is as easy as tapping on it and either A) using a very Brain Age-style handwriting recognition engine, or B) using an optional QWERTY keyboard that can be toggled on and off via the Select button. It's a very clean, mostly straightforward experience, and the little extras -- like the ability to save three in-progress puzzles to your profile, as well as a single and multi-card wireless mode for multiplayer puzzle collaboration -- add to the production.      The ~but~ comes from slight oversights. The menu system gets a little too cute for its own good, trying to keep with the crossword theme but making the layout a little too convoluted with clunky, criss-crossing game option buttons. The other problem is the inability to pull up the list of hints -- the only option is to look at each hint one-by-one by poking at their grid location on the puzzle. A newspaper lays out all hints so you can quickly scan through to the ones you know, and the DS version lacks this important feature. And some hot-key options, most notably the hints, are a little too easy to toggle. If you can't figure out a word you can simply hit a button on the DS or tap the on-screen icon to have the letter fill in automatically, but it's a feature that can be triggered by accident far too easily, and seeing as you're penalized for each time you use a hint, having it so simple to activate is a little sloppy in design.Even with the quirks, New York Times Crossword fills that casual gaming demographic quite well and is one of the first third-party games to really hit the ~Touch Generations~ target that Nintendo's nailed. A little more professional polish was all that was really needed -- it's a little goofy to boot up a classy production like New York Times Crossword, but then be whacked over the head with a Budcat logo that vomits a game controller before it kicks over to the game.", "date": "May 30, 2007"}
