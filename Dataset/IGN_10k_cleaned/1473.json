I've played my share of tough shooters before, but this is a whole new brand of tough.  We're talking poorly cooked beef here.  Capcom and Takumi's Mars Matrix, which arrived to Japan last week and is set for US release in the near future, asks the question: can one successfully navigate a screen that's filled with bullets from x to negative x and y to negative y?  The answer may be yes, or it may be no... after well over eight hours of play (not bad for a game whose arcade cousin lasted all of fifteen minutes), I'm not 100% sure.  Don't let the overhead 2D look of the game fool you.  You've never played a shooter quite like this before.  Not only is this the most intense shooter out there in terms of sheer spritage, but the gameplay system is so original.  First off, your ship is free to roam the entire screen, and can move on top of enemies, bosses, and pretty much everything in the background.  The only on-screen objects that can strike you are the enemy bullets.  And that's where things get tough.  Mars Matrix likes to fill the screen with enemy fire, and beginners will likely find themselves overwhelmed.  In order to get through the game without taking a hit, you need to, of course, master your bullet dodging abilities and make use of the game's peculiar ~mosquito~ suction system.  See, the ship in Mars Matrix isn't an ordinary space vessel.  We're dealing with a ~Mental Energy Reactive Fighter,~ which comes complete with three forms of attack: a standard laser blast, which is achieved by pressing the fire button over and over rapidly (or just holding down the handy rapid-fire button), a powerful pulse cannon, which is achieved by adding a delay between presses of the fire button, and the so-called ~Mosquito~ technique.  Your ships' Mosquito meter fills up with time, and when it's reached max, there are a couple of things you can do.  Press and hold the fire button, and the Mosquito meter will drain as your ship sucks in all its surrounding bullets, then sends out a fierce explosion that does damage to all surrounding ships - all the while, you're invincible to attack.  Most people will likely make the mistake of using the Mosquito meter for this so-called Gravity Bomb.  That's not its primary use, though, as once the screen has been cleared through the Bomb, you'll need to wait for the Mosquito meter to refill before you can reuse it, leaving your ship vulnerable to a screenfull of bullets.  Instead, you're supposed to deplete the meter only partially each time you use it, while at the same time weaving through incoming fire.  This lessens the time it takes for the suction technique to become available again, and when you do let go of the button, bullets that you've sucked up go flying back at the enemies.  Plus, if you time it right, you can make your ship invulnerable while waiting for the mosquito meter to replenish, reducing a screenfull of bullets do nothing more than fancy background scenery.  You'll need to use the mosquito technique and the two other attacks in order to collect little power-ups on screen left behind by enemies.  The power-up system in Mars Matrix is a bit different from the norm in that you don't collect weapon upgrades.  Instead, each time you strike an enemy, it leaves behind a golden box of varying size.  You're supposed to collect these in succession without letting up in order to keep a combo going.  Reach a certain point in the combo, and your ship's level goes up, over and over again until you've reached the 8th level.  Added levels means more fire power for your standard blast.  The little power ups are good for one additional feature: the game's shop mode.  By collecting as many of the power ups as possible, you can build up enough cash to unlock some cool goodies, including score attacks for every stage, added lives and continues in the arcade mode, a tutorial mode in which you can see the computer breeze through a level without taking a hit, and various modifications, like changing the color of your ship, the color of the background, and playing around with timing for the mosquito meter and combo gauge.  Whereas Gigawing was one of the most short lived experiences on Dreamcast, Mars Matrix ends up having a tremendous amount of replay value for a shooter thanks to this shop mode.  The game is a bit stingy in its rewards, asking that you play a bit too much before giving you something, but thankfully, there are a whole lotta ways for you to gain money.  Although there are only five levels of play, each level is also given new life through a remix mode, which rearranges the enemy formations, essentially forming a new level.  The score attack levels are also moderate variations on the regular levels, and you can die as much as you want, meaning these are made for money collection.  Doesn't that sound unique?  There are a few issues with the game, unfortunately.  Collision detection is questionable.  The game seems to let you get away with far too much, which may not seem like a problem for some, but I don't like the imprecision.  There were also too many times where I was sure I'd pressed the mosquito suction button, only to have my ship explode from enemy fire - controls and swear words went flying.  Finally, I'm not fully sure if it's possible to get through some of the later levels without taking a hit.  The game throws an alarming amount of bullets at the screen.  It's tough to tell if the later areas are designed to keep you inserting quarters, or if it just takes some extra practice.  In the latter case, actually practicing the these levels requires that you play through the rest of the game in full, as unlocking the score attack modes for these sections requires way too much money.  Also, there isn't anything worthwhile here for you unless you're just into the thrill of high-speed shooting.  This isn't an artistic shooter like Lords of Thunder or Einhander by any means.  In fact, the game is downright ugly in terms of artistic values, with music and graphic design that do nothing to stand out.  On a technical level, the billions of sprites flowing across the screen with only occasional slowdown makes it obvious that this game can't be done on another home system, but the graphics are low res (just try running the game on VGA - yuck) and the music is typical Capcom arcade machine sounds.  Rookies will certainly have a tough time of things in Mars Matrix.  Even on level one difficulty, unless you're a master of eye-hand coordination, you'll be pushed out of the game faster than a Genesis in Blast Processing Mode.  Continues are not unlimited in this game (unless you unlock a free-play mode), and in order to get more than three lives and three continues, you need to use some of your cash in the shop mode, which means you'll have to replay, replay, and replay until you've grown sick of the game  If you are into high-speed shooting, though, and want a good challenge and a unique gameplay system, Mars Matrix is exactly what you're looking for.  I wouldn't say it's the best shooter ever by any means, but it is the best shooter on Dreamcast.", "date": "Nov 14, 2000"}
