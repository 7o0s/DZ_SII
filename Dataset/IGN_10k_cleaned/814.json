Fronting our allowance or paperroute money on issues of Mad Magazine when they hit the shelves during out younger years when we though the magazine was actually funny. Tucked away in these issues were (and still are) multi-panel cartoons of the ever-continuing (and pointless) feuds of Black Spy vs. White Spy  aptly titled Spy vs. Spy. They got popular enough to spin-off a couple computer and NES games in the 80s, and those adventures continue on the Game Boy Color in Spy vs. Spy. Features 32 different levels Link cable support for two players Password save Only for Game Boy Color  I admit it  back in my Apple II days I had Spy Vs. Spy on a 5 1/4 floppy with a handwritten label attached (arrr, matey!). Problem was, without the manual I had absolutely no clue how to play the game. Thank god for the Game Boy Color version  not only do I get a near-exact copy of the game in portable form, it plays much better...AND it has a tutorial so I know what the heck I'm supposed to do.  The game puts you in the role of either the White Spy or the Black Spy. If you've ever read the cartoons in Mad, you'll quickly realize there's really no benefit to either one  they're simply carbon copies of each other. The whole plan is to uncover five items thrown about the game's levels, tucked under objects that must be inspected to find the item within. What you need to do is to put the other spy out of commission so you can take all the objects and head to the proper exit to make the getaway. How? By placing traps. You have an unlimited amount of booby traps to plant (which can backfire if you don't know where you placed them). A bucket of water can be planted above doors, a spring or bomb can be planted within room items, and a time bomb can be set in the middle of the room.  Each booby trap has a counter tool that can be used to disarm it  find pliers and you can disarm the spring. Find an umbrella and you'll be safe from the falling water. And simply walking out of a room with a time bomb in it will disarm that bomb. Since you have unlimited lives, you're only up against the clock and the other Spy  so if you get nailed by a trap, you're put out of commission for a few seconds. Learn to read the map to figure out where the objects and traps are planted, because you'll easily find yourself losing every round if you don't.  I couldn't even imagine this game without two player support  the whole idea is to outsmart the other spy, and outsmarting a computer opponent isn't as satisfying as toasting your opponent with the traps. The link-cable performs absolutely flawlessly in this case, and developers who claim that supporting the link isn't worth it or is just too difficult should look at what Kemco has accomplished. There's never a hitch in the gameplay, and it feels just like the other person is right there on the same system.     The game is unique in design, but it does present a few problems  first, it's really difficult to keep track of the rooms, just by look. Sure, you've got an easy-to-use map at the ready, but since the game moves so quick (and because the Game Boy Color screen can only show so much detail) it's hard to remember if you've been in the room you're currently in. The other issue is how the game automatically switches you to the other screen when you enter a room with the other spy. I found myself disoriented many times simply because I couldn't remember to look down on the other half of the screen when battling my opponent.  I was a little hesitant to play this game on the Game Boy Color, simply because of all the confusion this game offered on the Apple II more than a decade and a half ago. But as soon as I popped in the cartridge and walked through the 10 minute tutorial, I was all set. The game is still a bit on the confusing and maniacal side, but it's unique and fun enough to justify a purchase...and you might want to pick up an additional copy of the game for the awesome link cable support.", "date": "Mar 25, 2000"}
