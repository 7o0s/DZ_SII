And what might be even more surprising to some -- despite being out for nearly a year here in the United States, Sony's sleek computer entertainment system has yet to see a fishing game. Well, that is until now. As the clock is about to run out on the system's first glorious year, THQ and Pai, Inc. have come together and hooked up for the Elway-esque 98 yard scoring drive in the closing minutes, as they have delivered us the PS2's first fishing game in the form of BASS Strike.   Gameplay  In general, fishing games tend to land in either one of two categories -- arcade or simulation. BASS Strike is more of the latter, as it's a fairly accurate and deep simulation of sport fishing, while still maintaining some arcade elements to keep you from falling asleep at the reel.    The game has four gameplay modes including arcade, time trial, practice and tournament, with the tournament mode being the fish and eggs of the whole enchilada. It's in this mode, where players can enter into a eight round tournament to try and qualify for the main event, the BASS Masters Classic, where you'll get a chance to test your fish nabbing skills against 49 of the best anglers that this virtual world has to offer.    As the name suggests, it's all about catching bass. But don't think that this limits the game's depth, as that's the furthest thing from the case. Not only are there, five completely 3D lakes to fish in that all over different fishing opportunities and challenges, but there are also six different anglers that can be used once you unlock them all that all offer different sets of lures, abilities, attributes and tackle boxes.    Some of the anglers will have advantage in particular areas, depending on their strengths and weaknesses and available lures, so there's an insane amount of depth in just learning how to use each fisherman depending on where you're fishing. And since there are nearly 40 lures and handful of rigs to choose from, each of which are better suited for different conditions, you'll have to really learn how to fish to be successful in the game, regardless of the fisherman you use.   Other factors such as varying weather conditions and temperature will come into play, as all of these conditions will affect the behavior of fish. Therefore, learning how the conditions affect where the fish will be at will be integral in determining where you should cast your lure, what kind of lure should be used and how you should try and catch the crazy bass.    The control is pretty standard as far as fishing games go. The left analog stick is used to control your rod when the lure is in the water, the right analog stick is used for reeling in the line, and the various buttons are used for things like setting the hook, toggling free and drag spool and setting low or high drag. Plus, in some cases you'll be able to move the boat around the lake and even set it to trolling mode. It's pretty basic stuff, as it should be, with the skill coming into play with the finding of fish and the battle with it once you get it hooked.    Graphics  The only really good thing about the graphics here in BASS Strike is the look water. The reflections on the surface of the water are pretty nice and that combined with the glistening of the light bouncing off the water gives it a fairly realistic look. However, everything else is pretty substandard. The fish don't look all that realistic, the background feature a lot of low-res and low-poly objects that stand out next to the great looking water. It's simply a lackluster looking game on the whole with only a few things that stand out as being impressive.   Sound  BASS Strike features a lot of really nice ambient background effects and noises. The lures all each offer different sounds, the water sounds good and the music seems befitting of a fishing game. The only real downer here is that the voiceovers, either proclaiming ~fish-on~ or doing something like begging for a bite, can be a bit over-the-top and even annoying. Luckily, the voices can be turned down in volume or completely off if you're in agreement that they're not something that you want to listen to.BASS Strike is a really deep fishing game and if you're in the market for a game of this sort for your PlayStation 2, you'll probably want to pick this one up. It's not the best fishing game ever made by any means, but it more than serves its purpose. It's fun and can be addictive. What more could you want?", "date": "Oct 5, 2001"}
