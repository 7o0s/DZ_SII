I felt incredibly empowered, and kept re-thinking all of the events of the game. I wanted to talk about it with everyone, without sounding too much like a caffeine-induced cretin yahoo, and I'm quite sure I failed. But a good game will do that to you. It'll make you talk. Max Payne will do that to you.   Max Payne is one of those games I heard a lot about before I played it, since it came out on the PC first, and then arrived simultaneously on the PS2 and Xbox afterward. I had heard the hype and seen far too much of the infamous ~Bullet Time,~ a visual-gameplay concept that's strikingly popular these days, thanks to the visual special effects made famous in the movie The Matrix. When a game receives that kind of extensive hype I immediately become skeptical. So it wasn't until I was deep into the third part of Max Payne, high in the final steel and glass skyscraper, when the enemies grew in numbers, accuracy and gun power, that I realized just how cool Bullet Time, and Max Payne, really are.   I was one bullet away from death, my meter visually topped out with red, and I faced two thugs with double-fisted Ingrams and a pump-action shotgun behind a self-made bunker on the other side of a double-door. I loaded up my M-79 grenade launcher and just went balls out. I opened the door, jumped backward, hit Bullet Time and wiped them out without a scratch. I said something forgettable and out loud to myself, like, ~That was unbelievable.~ I couldn't help but smile. I was hooked.   Gameplay That's what Max Payne will do to you. From the creators of games Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior, 3D Realms, which acted as producers, and the Finnish-developer Remedy, Rockstar has brought yet another action-packed, white-fisted action game onto consoles across the world.   In Max Payne, players get the chance to play a character by the same name, a good cop who works in New York, and lives in the suburbs of New Jersey, with his lovely wife and newly born child. Until one day, drug-crazed thugs, hooked on the new drug V, break into his house and murder his family. That begins the real story of Mr. Payne, who becomes a disillusioned, tragedy of a man, entirely obsessed with solving the case of his family's short life. The game starts three years later when Payne finally gets his first big lead on the case, and when all hell breaks loose.   Shown from a third-person perspective, but as frantic as any first-person shooter, Max Payne takes players through a respectable 15-17 hour action romp, a one-man crusade of non-stop action and unfolding plot developments that weave equal parts of the kind of theatrical action seen in Diehard (the first one) with the Mickey Spillane-style monologue found in Blade Runner. Only this game is told in acts and chapters, and is deep with text and constantly twisting plots. The resulting fusion, framed in a graphic novel-style still frames and word balloons, is a cinematic action game that's as strong in gameplay as it is in style and presentation.    For anyone familiar with first-person shooters, Max Payne initially is rather ordinary. Players walk around looking for new doors to open, collect medicine to stay healthy and weapons to grow stronger, and confront hordes of thugs to shoot at. Many folks won't be terribly interested in the third-person perspective, which seems like a compromise to the sleek, fast first-person perspective. Indeed, Max Payne has its fair share of problems found in all third-person perspective games, such as collision detection, clipping through walls and characters, and most of all just trying to see over and around the character of Max Payne. Still, there's a good reason to put the game in the third-person perspective.   If the sad story doesn't hook you right away, and the rather straightforward action isn't your thing, Max Payne still has serious goodness to offer. That's where the novelty/feature of Bullet Time comes in. Bullet Time, in short, alters time so that everybody in the screen slows down, except for one thing: Your ability to shoot, which takes place in realtime. When you hit the PS2 analog L1 button, everything slows down including enemy bullets. A meter on the bottom left of the screen gauges the amount of Bullet Time you have, which is earned by the number of enemies killed. The feature looks like its straight out of the movie The Matrix, and perhaps it is, but it's implemented well enough so that one immediately feels at one with it.   Initially, Bullet Time felt like a novelty. For the first half of the game, I never felt that I really needed it. In all honestly, I did need it, but I felt that I could get away with just being smart and skilled. Seventy-five percent of the time in the first Act, I actually rolled, ducked and strafed with good effect, using Bullet Time prudently. And so the process of realizing the depth of Bullet Time took me time. But in the third act of the game, I used it often, as I was outnumbered and out-powered, and it worked well. In the third act, I used it as often as possible. That says more about the game than me though: Max Payne offers no end of action, but it does hit lulls and slow spots, and doesn't get really good until the latter third.   Still, what's great about Bullet Time is that gamers can create the scene however they want. They can go straight at the enemies, or use Bullet Time to dive, blast and get a little wild. That's the power of Bullet Time, it's creative, and it produces a surprising amount of spontaneous results that are guaranteed to raise eyebrows.    If only the level design were as interesting as Bullet Time. Some levels were excellently designed with good AI balance, gangster-style shootouts, and tough challenges. Knocking off the Trio was great fun, and sneaking around with only a baseball bat to protect myself was also sweet, too. In fact, there are numerous times in Max Payne that I felt seriously challenged: In the restaurant that lit up in flames; in all of the boss fights; riding the railcar through the fiery furnaces and blasting away the trip wires; the sequence in the third act when I had to jump through a corridor of moving trip wires, face off with several agents, and then had to get through the elevator shaft; and lastly, dusting off the final boss on the building top. All of these were great moments.   But there were just as many weak moments, too. The same restaurant that lit up in flames sequence is a classic try-and-die formula that was terribly frustrating the first few times through. The nightmare/dream sequences were PURE TORTURE, and are some of the most frustrating and weak moments in that game, or in any game. I am just very, very glad to not have been on the Max Payne testing team. What a nightmare. I mean, must the game torture the player to relay the feeling of Max Payne's um...pain? The worst thing about it is that there are TWO -- TWO -- of these levels placed in separate areas of the game.   The other aspects of the game that just didn't come across well are also inherent to the original PC game: The narration and the character control. For the most part, the narration is excellent. But there is so darn much of it. The heavy metaphors are good for a while, but they never seem to end. The descriptions of the night and the apocalypse and New York just become a little unbearable. The text definitely needed trimming. If you have ever seen the original Blade Runner, which features a heavy monologue from Harrison Ford's character, and then seen the director's cut, which completely deletes the entire monologue, you are presented with a completely different feeling, a completely different movie. Games are indeed different than movies, but Max Payne borrows heavily from the movies, and it's important to strike a balance.   Second, Max Payne features platform-style gameplay, specifically jumping, and the lack of precision control in Max Payne's walking, strafing and jumping is glaring. When players are first asked to perform a long jump from a rail to a moving train, it seems nearly impossible. Of course it's not, but the sloppy jumping, and shifty, sliding manner in which Payne moves and jumps will drive you nuts. This aspect of the game needs serious work. The jumping becomes more nightmarish in the utterly heinous nightmare levels, which require extreme precision.   Lastly, after having seen the PC version and having played the Xbox version, I must sadly admit that the PS2 version of Max Payne is definitely the weakest of the three, in all aspects. The load times, which were oft present in the PC version, are much longer in the PS2 version and far more numerous. The Xbox version blazes compared to the PS2 one.   Remedy ported this PC code to the PS2 pretty quickly, and simply chopped up the levels into smaller bits in order to work around the 32 MBs of PS2 RAM. The result is smaller levels, with more loading, slightly rearranged AI placement, but even worse is the heavy disruption to the flow and tension of the story, which tries desperately to feel like a movie, but instead feels like a TV show with hundreds of commercials shunt into it. It nearly ruins the experience.   Graphics One of Max Payne's strengths is its wide-ranging use of media, as it draws from comic book design, Hollywood cinematics, and dime-store detective novels. The weird mix of human models, with word bubbles popping from their mouths in the comic book panels, is kind of cool, while the constant use of in-game engine graphics used to set up and close dozens of levels also creates a nice feeling.   For the most part, the game reads well, too. It's narrated with a strong homage to the pulp fiction detective novel, using noir elements (everyone is a potential enemy; the crowded, claustrophobic city; the city as a living breathing entity, all females as strangely powerful creatures, etc.). Overall, Max Payne's presentation, with the exception of load times, is fantastic.   Aside from presentation, PS2 Max Payne is a visually mixed game. The character models are blocky and they could definitely have used more polygons to smooth out the many rough edges. The textures on the characters are good, not great, but they're much better than the textures used in the backgrounds. The resolution is low, too, much lower than in the Xbox version, and the game's framerate is also much slower, ranging in the 30s, and ducking well below, too. Special effects such as lighting and reflections, and which the PS2 is good at doing, have been seriously toned down in this version.   There are dozens of instances where the Xbox (and of course the PC version) completely outshine the PS2 version, and it breaks my PS2 biased heart to admit it. Just a few of them include steam from bathtubs, cleaner, sharper textures everywhere, better resolution throughout, noticeably better looking fire, and better looking characters. The only area the Xbox version appears worse is with the text. The font is harder to read in that version.   Visually, one of the coolest elements about Max Payne is the focus on Bullet Time. With cinematic action sequences in which enemies are blown back with the force of your bullets, and your ability to see bullets flying through the air, is just awesome. But to be honest with you, this element is almost entirely lost in the PS2 version. When I sat down to play the Xbox version, I couldn't believe how much I was missing. In the PS2 version, you can barely, if at all, see the bullets flying through the air in Bullet Time -- a total disappointment.  Sound The most memorable sound from Max Payne is the deep, singular and recurrent note of the piano, issuing a dark and resonant tone. It takes a lot for a game to have memorable music, and sound effects, and for the most part, Max Payne delivers. It offers a good mix of guitar-laden rock, with several hyper-tense variations of action music scattered throughout. I remember a rather hilarious little section that focused on rockabilly music that reminded me of some of the tracks from Pulp Fiction, too, kind of old-fashioned surf music stuff.   The sound effects comprise the voices of Max and all his enemies, car screeches, roaring fire, the voices of Max's wife and baby, and some pretty awesome death screams. Most notable in this lot is Max's narration, whose voice acting is hard-line, deadpan, and constant. His job is well done. The dialog and voice acting for the enemies also are excellently acted, providing much needed tongue in cheek humor, plenty of self references, some pretty weird gangster, bad-guy chatter.   The overall collection of death screams is also quite cool. The only time the death screams and voice acting went horribly wrong was in the dream sequences, and especially in the second one. When Max dies, there is simply no need to hear him scream for what seems like 15 seconds at the top of his lungs. Yeah, those dream sequences were a bummer. I'm usually skeptical of PC game ports, and Max Payne, which has received a tremendous level of hype, only added to the fire. After finally getting deep into the game's central feature, Bullet Time, however, I was able to clearly see, hype aside, what all the fuss was about, and it was all worth it...mostly. You see, Max Payne is the first in a long line of games that are likely to use the Matrix style cinematic technique that in this game goes by ~Bullet Time.~ I'm all for it, as long as the game itself supports the novelty feature with good gameplay, design, AI, and the like. Max Payne does a mixed job of that, faltering the most with jumping and the platform-style elements, and in the early part of the game, when Bullet Time isn't needed, it becomes more of a novelty. To be honest with you, I love action games, and Max Payne delivers non-stop, ultra cool, and fun-as-hell action. And I highly recommend it on the PS2, if that's the only system you own. But if you own a PC or an Xbox, definitely skip this version, as it's the weakest of the trio in every aspect. The extra load times, broken up levels, longer load times, and the numerous visual letdowns, including the almost criminal lack of bullet time visuals -- such as bullets -- hamper this game dramatically.", "date": "Dec 12, 2001"}
