The series has taken a surprisingly abrupt turn toward a more action oriented approach. Sure you'll still be running through the backwoods of Australia, Siberia, Alaska and Africa but you won't really be hunting anything. Instead, you'll pretty much just be ruthlessly killing it.   That's not to say it's a bad thing, just don't think you'll need to set up any decoys or make any animal calls. The setup for the game is pretty basic. You're an expert hunter and keep getting asked by people to help kill big game, protect villages, or rescue certain people. Though the game's environments may give the impression of being expansive, each mission is laid out in an extremely linear fashion. You'll generally progress through from point A to point B along a marked path. Along the way you'll get updated mission objectives like taking out groups of animals, protecting an injured guide, or securing items.   On your way through each level you're going to get attacked by various wild animals. Since you're getting attacked, there's no real hunting in this game. Think of it more as a first person shooter where the nameless grunts you'd normally battle are replaced with wolves, wild boars, cougars, dingoes and polar bears. There is a slight degree of distinction between each enemy's behaviors. Some will bowl you over, some will pounce on your face and others will just knock you backward, but the method of killing them remains the same across the board: shoot their heads. After you complete one of the game's areas you'll be able to hunt in it, but this is an incredibly simplified version of what there was before. All you do is hit the crouch button, sneak up to your foes and shoot them.   This bear is obviously asking for it. To properly plant lead in the skulls of these wild, innocent animals you'll be able to use a variety of weapons. However, you're not going to be buying these guns from a shop, they're given to you in each mission. Along the way you'll get access to shotguns, machetes, pistols and tranquilizer guns. With your gun, you'll be able to blast rounds into wildlife, perform a melee bash and even block incoming attacks. While you might find ammo pickups littered around a desolate Australian plain to be unrealistic, the game has much stronger examples of this series taking an acute turn towards the unrealistic.   Perhaps the most surprising feature of Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2, aside from the total format change, is the addition of a slow-motion button. Yes that's right, as you plow through each of the game's hunting areas you'll be able to slow down time to place a perfect shot. You'll need to use this quite a bit, mostly during some of the game's chase sequences. You'll find you occasionally wind up on the backs of moving vehicles, be it a jeep or a helicopter, and are required to use a scoped rifle to take out rampaging elephants or boars. Eventually, you'll even run into a few boss fights against foes with names like Hogzilla, in addition to a battle of a more mythical nature.   Do a somersault. Do it! Though the slow motion button is helpful, it's overpowered since there's no limit to how much you can use. When you initially enable slow motion mode you'll see a bar appear in the lower right hand corner that gradually depletes. Once gone, you exit slow motion mode, but then you can just hit the button again to give yourself a full bar. All of a sudden, plugging cows rampaging out of a forest fire doesn't seem like as much of a challenge.   Your character in CDH2 is one durable implementor of wildlife carnage. As you take damage while you can stand still for a brief period and your health will regenerate. There are also health packs littered around each stage you can pick up. The game turns out to be really easy to get through by using your ability to both regenerate health and slow time.   Alright, so it's been established that this is in no way a hunting game and totally breaks from the direction of the series, but is it any fun? Well, sort of. Once the initial hilarity of how odd this game is wears off you'll find it to be, at its core, a very simple first person shooter. To give the action a little variety once in a while there are traps you'll need to watch out for, such as bear traps on the ground and cages that drop from the trees. Getting caught in a trap will injure certain parts of your body. For instance, getting snapped up in a bear trap will render you immobile for a time. When you finally pull yourself out you're movement will be impaired, emphasized by the screen wobbling to mimic a limp. You'll also get other types of temporary injuries, including one where it can be assumed that your eye gets injured, drowning the screen in blood.     Since the first title, this game has been given significant graphical upgrades. The sky, you'll notice, has an excellent amount of detail and some of the lighting effects are impressive for sure. While the gun models are sorely lacking luster, the animal models sport a great level of detail and their attack animations are pretty decent as well. It's not so realistic that you're going to jump 10 feet in the air and scream about how polar bears are invading your living room through your television, but you're not going to hate it. The animations are decent, and some of the death animations are hilarious. For instance, sticking a tranq dart in an elephant that's running full speed toward you causes it, once the tranq takes hold, to do a titanic forwards somersault. As everyone I'm sure knows, elephants in combination with unconscious somersaults equals comedy gold.   You'll also get some story sequences in the game, though most of the story is just a flimsy excuse to get you to different areas around the world. Some sequences are done with the in-game engine and aren't all that great, but there are some impressive fully voiced CG sequences that your eyes will have no complaints about watching. It's too bad that the environments themselves weren't more interesting, especially considering how pretty the animal models and sky are.   The game's soundtrack consists of animal growls here and there, and the weapon effects aren't that bad, it's mostly limited to a few ambient effects like bird calls and insect chirps. The voices are total caricatures of the characters they represent, such as Reginald's overly stuffy English accent or Old Hugh's grizzled woodsman tone.   You'll spend a lot of your time protecting your guides (they're dumb). A few frustrating elements of the game were how difficult it is to locate enemies at times and how unclear your objectives are in some cases. Almost every time you get attacked, your enemies hop out of the bushes at you. This can be excused, since there's usually long grass around and it would make sense that animals would be hiding themselves in it. But too often you're left spinning in circles trying to locate your foe while he keeps hitting you in the back. If you had some sort of alternate method of drawing him out, like a decoy or something along those lines, this may not have been a problem. As it is, you've only got your gun and slow-motion button, and just have to wait until you can the animal appears until you can attack him.   Despite each level's linearity, you'll find yourself at spots when it seems like you've completed your objective but actually haven't. I ran into a problem during the Search and Rescue mission where the game said I had located the girl I was supposed to rescue, but I actually needed to run into a hidden area of forest to go get her. My guide at the time was just wandering around in a circle near a river bank and he was what my map was pointing to as an objective, so I wound up having to wander all over the place until I finally found the girl nearby. Given how much the game likes to give you direction throughout, it's odd to find these instances where more instruction would have been helpful and relieved a lot of frustration.   The game is 12 storyline missions long with 4 optional hunt area missions. There are also some bonus missions to unlock if you shoot enough of the hidden stumps in each level. Making your way through the game will only take around 8 hours and unless you really, really like shooting wolves in the head, you're not going to be returning. Despite minor behavioral differences in the animals, there's little more to this game than point and pull the trigger.  This isn't a hunting game. There's a lot of shooting, but you won't be tracking down any animals with any sort of strategy. The hunting area levels give you some freedom to move around and take down a foe, but it's still find animal, shoot and kill. As a first person shooter, this game has some neat features like a block and slow motion, but it's not enough the save the game. Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2 has a few nice visual effects and sounds, but for hunting fans and shooter fans alike, you're going to want to look elsewhere. That is, of course, unless you absolutely need to see an elephant do a drugged-out somersault.", "date": "Dec 6, 2005"}
