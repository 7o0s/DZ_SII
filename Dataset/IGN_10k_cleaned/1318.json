A little boobie wiggle, a little booty waggle, and suddenly you're a lot closer to shipping a buggy, clunky game. Since you can never trust the controls to work as they're supposed to, something has to grab the player's fancy. And since these Danger Girls don't need anything extra to fill up their double-D cups, the padding went into the gameplay.   You already know what you're in for with Danger Girl. Don't kid yourself into thinking a game that juts off the shelf won't walk in Lara Croft's slinky steps. This is a stew of brothy gameplay  -- a mix of Syphon Filter, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, Duke Nukem: Time To Kill, Die Hard Trilogy, Castlevania 64, even Space Ace -- and the only reason why nobody told the designers that this might not be such a good idea is because when the Danger Girl chefs leaned to stir the brew, they bent at the waist.    Gameplay If Gabe Logan had to live in an all-female apartment complex like Kip in Bosom Buddies, the resulting videogame would probably be something akin to Danger Girl (only without a Wendie Jo Sperber -- she's a little too plump for the PS One.) Abbey Chase, Sydney Savage, and the cornfed new girl JC all pack a pocket textbook of Syphon Filter in their bras.  That's great news for the Danger Girl squad, as 989's espionage game was armed with golden guns. The Danger Girl squad pops around corners with guns ablaze and pop heads like balloons in a carnival -- Gabe would be proud. Better yet, instead of looking at Gabe wobble on his feet like he's got a load in his diapers, you instead get a glimpse of some tightly packed buns.  It all sounds so nice, doesn't it? And with so much boobage being bared in the game and in the extra art, Danger Girl seems like something you wouldn't mind nuzzling with for a while. Unfortunately, there's a lot of bad nookie in this game, and it begins with the control. We know it may break some hearts to know that these fun bags aren't much fun to play with, so we've taken the approach the designers took -- if it upsets you to know that this game isn't the peak of good times, just stare at the pictures on the sides and chant to yourself, ~There's no place like in between those...~   What goes wrong with Danger Girl? Name it, and it will be botched. For one, these bazooka-carrying girls aren't straight shooters. You may be able to hit the broad side of a barn with some effort, but pegging the fat cow in front of the barn is out of the question. N-Space has packed in the most inaccurate Auto-aim feature ever -- it's like the girls have horse blinders on to protect themselves from danger by blocking it from their vision. You're supposed to rely on sneaky ninja tactics to take enemies out without them spotting you, but when you can't hit a still target at point-blank range, what's the purpose of sneaking up on them?    The worst of it all is that the game is fundamentally damaged on the inside-- a few bug fixes, and it might have been a killer with a jiggle. If I didn't know better, I'd say that N-Space rushed the game out the door, because there are things any monkey in testing could have found. Why does turning on Analog control with the Dual Shock disable the Triangle button and lock up the control sometimes? And how come other buttons (particularly the feature that allows the girls to shimmy up against a wall) simply fail to work every now and again. Touchy control is one thing, but when I press a key, something should happen. And if any game were made to be played with the Dual Shock, the curvy controller with its two projecting knobs...    The Danger Girls rely on their cat-like reflexes and nimble bodies to get ahead, but it seems that those skin-tight suits have crimped these girl's style. They can hardly lift those legs over obstacles, and they trip up and get snagged on corners all over the game. This is one of those poor 3D games where you have to press the jump button repeatedly to free yourself from a box or rock because the polygons got stuck together. Opening up ammo crates is trickier than defusing a bomb. If you want to aim your gun manually, you might want to ask your opponent if he wouldn't mind standing still while you shoot them, because it's going to take you quite a while to get the crosshairs where you want them -- either the cursor moves painfully too slow, or jerkily too fast. It would have been nice if you could just throw your Glocks down, but for some reason, these Kung-Fu kittens can't throw a punch. Thankfully, the AI is near stupid enough to let you spend time finding your aim. Like Pit Bulls, enemies are set to either ~Duh~ or ~Hey!~   Graphics  If 32-24-36 is a flat fatty in your book of supermodel fantasies and anime reveries, then the hyper-inflated Dream Girls in Danger Girl will float your boat. N-Space has made sure to cross all of its Ts and capitalize all of their As. Thanks to input form the comic's creators, there's plenty of stylishly bared flesh and sultry silhouettes drawn in the characters and cut scenes.    Of course, as you already know, boobs on the side of the text here means that there's something that needs covering up, and sadly, that's the rest of the visual design. The game is spray-painted in pixels, then glossed up with fake light effects in hopes that players will race through the dull worlds with their eyes firmly glued to the bobbing butt at the center of the screen. Take a look around, and you'll find blocky messes on the sides and inanimate enemies in your path.   The trouble comes in when the visuals stand in the way of the gameplay. N-Space has a beefy engine, with a long draw distance and a nice transparency effect when the girl's upper bodies obscure the view. But with a good start, the team failed to finish the game. The game camera is a little too distracted by the bosom body in front of it, and fails to catch any of the rest of the action in the game except for the booty action. That means in a fire fight, all you'll ever see is a big old butt in your face. A nice butt, to be sure, but it would be better if you could live another day to see other butts. Also on vacation was the animation department, as the Danger Girls never react when they're taking shots to the head. I supposed that so long as bullets don't mess up their hair, these ladies don't care what goes into their bodies. Yet for gamers who would like to see the girls live just long enough to shed those clothes once more, it would be nice if we knew when they were about to die so that we could save their lives. Instead, the girls just stand there as bullets whiz through their ears, unconcerned that one might puncture their brains.  Sound   The fact that we have already started the sound section with a pair of distracting boobies should clue you in that the audio is hurting. And if you've noticed that the bobbies have visible nipples, then you know -- the sound in this game is wretched. If you can get past the cheesy catch phrases of the Danger Girl squad, you'll still have to contend with the sad enemy voices (which are limited in vocabulary to ~You there~ and ~Hey!~), the stock sound effects (including about three gun sound effects total), the inept mixing (where only two effects can be running consecutively before the music vuts out),and the dreadfully composed music (which loops and skips off of the CD like a record left out in the sun). Too bad they didn't foley the sound of the material in their bra moving as the girls run, because at least that would have reminded me of the boobies when I reached for the Mute button.  Big breasts can go a long way to brightening up any day, but with gameplay this dim, even these headlights can't light up this game.", "date": "Oct 6, 2000"}
