Anyway, so I used to go to vocational in High School (Carpentry), and on the bus on the way home there were always these two guys who were living it: the Two Live Crew dream. Their clumsy freestyle raps filled the back of the bus, most of which I can't repeat, and all of which the entire busload of people tried to ignore. Their biggest hit of the bunch, however, was a certain tune titled after the catchy chorus of ~No Ass, No Backstage Pass,~ which basically went ~No ASS, no backstage PASS... no ASS, no backstage PASS.~ So here I am years later sitting with the game Backstage Pass in front of me. Butt-obsessed teenage rapping or premonition? I'll let you be the judge.  Sierra, always ready to keep the You Don't Know Jack fire burning, has enlisted computer gameshow pioneers Berkeley Systems to create ~the ultimate rock and roll trivia game,~ though without computer gameshow pioneers/writers/designers Jellyvision. What we're left with, then, is a trivia game that sorta kinda maybe feels a lot like a YDKJ: Music Edition, but fails to deliver the final formula.  You'll be hard pressed to tell the difference from the first few moments, though. The popping text, slamming menu systems, obnoxious hosts and funky button-trigger sounds are all here, as is the basic structure of ~listen for a really long time, answer a question, then hear the monologue.~ Mini-games such as Spot On have you matching similar items, something YDKJ fans should be familiar with, and a cool sub-game has you listening to a track and trying to figure out the artist. Eat it, Name That Tune! As with YDKJ, you're able to pick between one and three players -- two and three really, since there aren't any AI opponents for one player games. Basically, if you're playing one player you're a cheater and you should be very, very ashamed of the fact that you're memorizing questions for when your friends come over. Maybe you should find healthier ways of showing them up, like driving two wheeled through the Sizzler parking lot.  But is it fun? If you love You Don't Know Jack, this should be familiar territory, and while this game is not a direct sibling, it's at least a sort of bumbling cousin. The music cues are great, the art design is really nice, particularly the tiny touches like the passes for your player icon, or the tiny metal chain used as a timer. The art design is filled with charm, without the empty blackness of YDKJ. Of course, a quiz game isn't a quiz game without some great questions, and this is where Backstage Pass fumbles and falls.  The range of topics is commendable -- you've got everything from folk and metal to specialized areas like 60's Pop, 70's Bubble, 80's/90's Rap, New Wave, 70's R&B, and so on. The range of artists tended to keep pretty fresh as well, such as in a game I played that featured questions tapping Oasis, Smokey Robinson, The Sugarcubes, Pizzicato Five, Great White and Cheap Trick (Cheap Trick!!!).  It's a great move, because it gives the game a nice variety, rather than if the designers have just tossed everything into bigger R&B, Rap, Folk, and Rock type categories. The questions themselves tend to be on the easy side, especially if you're a music buff, something that this game should basically rely on. Instead it goes for the broader range, keeping questions simple, and focusing more on cheesier jokes to keep you involved. You may learn that John Denver wrote Peter, Paul & Mary's Leaving on a Jet Plane, but do we need a crack about ~at least Denver wasn't flying that plane.~ Well maybe... but how about ~more blue moons than a frat party full of Smurfs.~ This is definitely pot calling the kettle black, but I could have done without a lot of the cheese factor jokes that tended to feel more like filler than actual entertainment.  With 600 questions this one will keep you busy for a while, though like all these types of quiz games, it's more about your interest level than anything else. The slow pacing, mounds of filler, and simple questions may not fulfill your voracious musical appetite -- but if you're cool with a generalized quiz game that takes plentifully from Britney Spears and Burning Spear, than this may be a nice addition to your musical collection.  -- Vincent Lopez      Want to share your opinions with the world?
