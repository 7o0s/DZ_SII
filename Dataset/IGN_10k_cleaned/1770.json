Now Colin McRae 2.0 has finally come out well after its competitors, and the hype wave couldn't be bigger.  With Rallying's biggest name actively participating, how could Codemasters not build a masterpiece designed to quickly put dust on the jewel cases of its competitors?  Well, there's just one problem.  For every three people I see arguing about realistic Rally Physics, I get four opinions (as the saying goes).  To make matters worse, two of the three claim to be real Rally drivers and the third one feels he's qualified because he once did donuts in his VW Beetle in some gravel!  What's more, the real WRC drivers are almost useless in this regard because (a) they have better things to do than play Rally games (such as actually, ya know, Rally!), and (b) no one has accurately produced the seat-of-the-pants feel of throwing a car around terrain while you're in the midst of discovering just what that terrain is.  First of all, it was not Colin McRae Rally that hooked me on Rally sims.  It was Mobil 1 Rally Championship.  Never did I have to concentrate for so long and listen so carefully while driving around perilous and unpredictable terrain.  When Colin McRae finally showed up, I felt that it physically acted more like a real car, but gone were the one-car-wide roads and the 15-30 minute stages.  The graphics couldn't compare to Mobil 1, either.  But Colin McRae filled a need for a sit-down-and-play Rally Experience that was challenging and let me slide around a lot like I saw Rally Cars doing on TV, rather than hug the road as well as the cars do in Mobil 1.  When Codemasters came out promising a serious upgrade to Colin McRae I was incredibly psyched.  But while they took their sweet time showing us screen shots and video clips, Infogrames handed us Rally Masters, and not only did we have a very fast Rally game with McRae-length stages and an arguably better physics model, but it came with full Internet multiplayer, and it remains to this day the only realistic way to go at it over the Net with distant Rally Drivers.  So finally Colin McRae 2.0 came out, and I have now played both the imported version I bought and the US release.  The major difference between the two seems to merely be that the co-driver is no longer Nicky Grist (Colin's real life co-driver), but an American substitute.  Whether this is an asset or a liability is up to you.  I'd rather have Grist.  He's the guy I hear on TV!    First, let me talk about the absolutely number one feature of this game:  the cars.  The car models are all that they are promised to be.  You can see from the screenshots the fact that you just can't tell these things are made up of polygons most of the time.  They are curvaceous and sport environment mapping (even cubic environment mapping  if you don't know what that is, then you don't have a CPU powerful enough to run it, so forget I mentioned it).  The cars now have realistic suspensions so instead of bunny hopping around as they did in the first version, the cars lean hard during cornering, and wheels droop and get slammed into their wells.  You can see the two drivers in the car, though they look like something the Lego people came up with, and if you damage the car, you will take damage.  Usually this means shattered glass and eventually missing glass.  Tail and headlights smash and metal bends.  Even the bonnet, er, hood will start flapping in the breeze if you bash it enough.  The damage is still too forgiving compared to its peers.  You don't really pay much for it except in the garage when you're trying to budget your time to fix the wreckage.  Further, windows will smash while the remainder of the car remains amazingly intact and shiny.  For some reason, Codemasters really didn't want to take the shine off of the cars. They add mud almost reluctantly compared to Rally Masters.  Each car has its own unique cockpit.  Some have better views than others, but they are each unique and that adds authenticity.  Mobil 1 also has this, but Rally Masters doesn't.  It's also fully 3D.  This means that you'll lean with the car under hard cornering and it will move up and down.  To prove that it's fully 3D I hooked up my Elsa Revelator glasses (must-haves by the way), and enjoyed the full 3D interior of the Subaru.  That was unbelievable!  Unfortunately, even if you smash up your windows, unlike the other Codemasters series, TOCA Touring Cars, you don't ever see your window get smashed.  Also, for some reason someone at Codemasters decided to add tinted windows to the mix, making the outside surroundings look pale bluish.  If you run in 16-bit color (all my screenshots are in 32, sorry), then you see actual color banding of the tinting across the inside of your windshield.  This was enough to send me to 'hood-cam' for awhile until some enterprising hacker (sorry, I forgot your name) fixed the problem and now we have transparent windshields (go to https://www.simracingnews.com for details).  The external graphics show off the cars beautifully and there are no clipping or seams problems that I've noticed.  The main problem I did notice is that the Codemasters' graphics engine doesn't know when to turn off headlight reflections on the road.  Sometimes inappropriate surfaces reflect that vertical beam of light, such as wet gravel or snow.  It's not a terrible problem, but I wish it could have been fixed.  The tracks don't deserve the same praise as the cars do, mainly because they are quite repetitive within a country.  Most areas within a country look simply too familiar.  An S turn through woods in England looks like any other S-turn through woods in England.  Mobil 1 and Rally Masters both vary their level graphics far more than this.  The actual quality of the surroundings is fine, I just wish there was more variation.  The biggest knock on reality in the whole game perhaps is the fact that the roads are just too darn wide.  A couple of my screenshots shows you just how ridiculously wide these tracks are.  If you watch real Rallying you'll see much of the adrenalin comes from how little margin of error you have.  You don't just toss the car into every corner knowing you can slide 30 feet wide of the apex.  You have to slow the car down and get it turned, with the handbrake if necessary, but not using up too much of the road, both because of damage and because you might find yourself rolling down a hillside.  Codemasters surrenders towards ~the masses~ by letting you have nice wide roads that are nice and slick so you can rip around them and feel like you're really having fun, and you are, but it's not as realistic as it should be.  The cars are also easier to drive, in general, than Rally Masters.  Again, a concession to playability.  If so, Codemasters wins here, but the hardcore have often gone scurrying back to Rally Masters for the more brutal unforgiving system of braking and steering that categorizes that title.  However, you can really beat up these cars at least in the repair spots every two stages.  You only have an hour to change setups and repair what you need to repair.  I haven't felt a tremendous amount of difference based upon damage, except that I think that speed drops.  Handling feels more or less the same.  Still, it can't be good for your lap times to be banging into things, and you'll want the leftover time to tweak the setups.  You can save the game at each repair stop, as well, and you can name slots, but if you overwrite a slot you cannot rename it (bug!).  So the saved game might say Australia but your description says, ~A really great job in Sweden.~  Right.  Colin does away with the Rally School that characterized the first title, but adds in Rally Masters style ~special stages~ used in real life to pit identical cars against one another in parallel circuits which cross over into one complete circuit.  You can also do some arcade racing with 4 other Rally cars through various countries.  But the heart of the game is still the Rally Championship, and three levels of difficulty will give you all you can handle.  In the Intermediate mode, I was holding my own and scoring points in each round until we hit Australia, and for some reason I cannot get a handle on that one.  I'm going to have to do some time-attacks on it to get the hang of it.  This brings up another problem with the game.  Codemasters likes to make you unlock courses.  This is another arcade-style feature which has no place in this game.  Even the great Colin McRae retires from Rallies once in awhile, scoring no points at Rally.  He is not banned from the next event!  You've got to place 6th or higher to move on.  Even though codes exist that will unlock all bonus cars and tracks, this doesn't work around the problem of having to place 6th in a Rally to move to the next one.  Mobil 1 wins in that category!  Weather is modeled in several varieties, including rain, snow, morning and evening.  Lights will be on as needed, unless you've knocked them out.    The audio in the game is just fine, with nice backfire noises, spooling turbos and crunching gravel.  Of the three games, only Rally Masters is similar to Colin McRae and they are both fine, although I like the backfires in Colin better.  As far as pace notes from your co-driver, both games are hit and miss.  I still get annoyed when I hear ~don't cut~ just in time to cut and hit a tree or a small boulder, but in general if I'm paying attention and am dialed into what he's saying, I do fine.  Replays are shown after each Rally, but they aren't saved.  You can watch them again and again, but once you exit the stage, they are gone.  Hopefully a patch will come out letting you save Replays.  CMR is the only one of the major Rally sims to omit this!  Also, in the special stages, the manual transmission goes flakey and your shifts aren't always recognized, making intermediate or advanced challenge games almost pointless if you like to shift yourself.  And then of course there's the tinted windshields which have just got to go.  Another problem with replays is that they seem to betray some kind of flaw in the vehicle dynamics.  Sometimes the car slides laterally opposite the direction of the G-forces pulling it to the outside of the turn.  Now, if grip were re-acquired you would expect a bit of this, but because the car seems to often float opposite that direction rather than steer that direction, it looks a bit hokey.  I'm not sure what's going on here, but it happened in the first version of the game, too, and needs to be addressed.  There are supposedly over 90 new tracks in this version of the game, although some are mirrors and extensions of one another, but easily there is enough to keep you busy as long as you like.  The key is to go as fast as possible while not destroying your car completely.  Car setup is mysterious, but web sites are emerging with tips on how to set up your car best for each country.  The lack of proper Internet play is a big disappointment.  Rally Masters showed exactly how it could be done, but Codemasters didn't get the message.  I tried with varying numbers of people on the Internet and it was just ridiculous.  Only on independent time trial mode could we compete without screen freezes (since the game didn't need to draw the other car).  The documentation pleads that the game is meant for LAN play and not Internet play: a real copout.  Unless Codemasters is making this game for other game companies, they better wake up and realize where the online play is really happening.  The bottom line is how fun this game is and how great it looks and sounds.  I have to answer that the game is fun and looks and sounds fine, but it fails to deliver any kind of knockout blow to its competition.  Looking at a checklist of each game, you'd see each has its strengths and weaknesses.  I play Rally Masters online, Mobil 1 when I want the REAL tracks and adrenalin, and Colin McRae when I just want to slide around and have fun.  They all look good with 3D glasses anyway!  But I'm waiting for that patch from Codemasters to show me they really meant business with this title, or it will continue to be a good title that should have been great.  You should add this to your library if you play Rally games, but don't build it up into something it's not.  -- Randy Magruder      Want to share your opinions with the world?
