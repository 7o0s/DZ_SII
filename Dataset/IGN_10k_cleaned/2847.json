{"name": "BCT Commander", "name_review": "BCT Commander", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/12/bct-commander", "text": "is the logical extension of the argument that graphics don't matter.  With the exception of an occasional sound effect, this is flash-free minimalist wargaming with a ~just the facts, ma'am~ approach.  There isn't a single line drawn that isn't intended to convey some information.  Unfortunately, this minimalist flavor-free approach can get obscure and it ultimately doesn't work very smoothly.   BCT Commander is the combined release of ProSim Companys Brigade Combat Team bundled with the scenarios from three expansion packs that followed it, as well as some custom made scenarios and a construction kit.  It models contemporary ground warfare, with ground troops, armored vehicles, support vehicles, artillery, close air support, minefields, ground radar, and even chemical warfare and tactical nuclear weapons.  Although it runs in real time, you can pause and give orders at any time or run at an accelerated pace if you're just waiting for units to move into position.  The player can give specific fire missions to artillery and mortar units, but otherwise input is limited to moving units around until they come in contact with enemy forces and start firing automatically.   Each scenario starts with a handful of units for you to set up however you want.  Objectives and intelligence are drawn in bold lines across the map that can be turned off when the scenario begins.  Maps consist primarily of contour lines for elevation data and a grid to show ranges.  There's an interesting spread of missions included, pitting real world force against each other in locations such as Kosovo, Bosnia, Kuwait, Israel, Iraq, and even Afghanistan.  There are historical scenarios dating back to the Arab Israeli conflicts of 1973 as well as hypothetical contemporary scenarios using high-tech equipment.   Each unit is presented as an icon without any additional information unless you right click on it to bring up a menu and choose 'unit info'.  Even then, you only get limited info about the unit name and its speed.  Detailed information isn't available unless you pause the game.  Setting up movement orders requires either painstakingly dropping waypoint nodes for each unit or cutting and pasting movement orders to several units.  Either way, it takes a lot of shuffling around in the menus.  You can bring up what's called a ~line of sight fan~ for any unit or location, but it's hard to make sense of the series of lines radiating outward from a point.  Unit icons can be set to display in one of four sizes, but the smaller sizes are hard to read and the larger sizes cover so much terrain it's difficult to place your forces with any precision.  There are a few zoom levels on the map, which scrolls slowly and can look awfully busy, even at the tightest zoom level.     Noodling around with the interface is really problematic when you consider how slowly BCT Commander runs.  For such a minimalist presentation, it moves with a gummy consistency that can make it hard to use the mouse.  Sometimes mouse clicks don't read unless you select something repeatedly.  For some reason, the maps won't display if your desktop is running in 32-bit mode, so you might have to lower your color resolution before you start the game.  Windows within the game can't be resized, so you'll have to scoot chunks of text around to read them.   Watching icons move and do their own thing in real time works really well with a game like Harpoon, which is modeling high tech warfare in the vast expanse of the ocean, as if you were watching from some remote command center.  Harpoon is about specific missiles, ships, and aircraft, all separated by empty miles.  But the warfare being modeled in BCT is much different.  It is literally and figuratively a much muddier affair.  In ground warfare like this, there are multiple men and vehicles scattered around, firing multiple types of ordnance around uneven terrain.  The situation is severely impacted by soft factors like morale, suppression, and how well a gun is aimed.  Making sense of all this is difficult when all you've got to go on is an icon and some information buried underneath it a menu or two deep.   Another problem is that the game assumes a certain amount of familiarity with contemporary military jargon.  I consider myself a wargamer, but BCT Commander freely slings around acronyms and terms that are way over my head.  I can recognize specific hardware like a BRDM or an AT-6 Spandrel, but I have no idea what an MCLiC is, much less an MRD or a FIST-V.  On the fire mission dialogue box, there's no easy way to figure out that DPICM stands for Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munitions and FASCAM stands for Family of Scatterable Mines.  And once you've figured this out by scouring the manual, there's not much indication what exactly they are.  The manual casually mentions at one point that a ~MOPP 4~ designation in the unit info box means built-in protection from chemical contamination, but imagine the confusion until you stumble across that line.  Some missions have the objective that you're supposed to destroy an MRR.  One type of infantry is a dismount ADA.  You can orient minefields in your choice of mils from 0 to 6400.  There are references to something called a linear sheaf.  Go figure.   I'd love to learn more about this sort of stuff, but BCT Commander just dumps it in my lap as if I should already know it.  There's some online help and the manual can be informative, but the information is scattered around and hard to reference.  If you've ever sat through a lecture from a boring teacher who insists on using obscure jargon, you'll have a sense for how most non-military personnel will feel wading into BCT Commander.  Hey, BCT Commander, help me out here!  You can assume I'm interested in the subject matter, but I'm not an expert.When you consider that the game's minimalism is muddied by it technical problems and interface, and that it talks in language for die-hard military geeks, BCT Commander is niche wargaming at its worst: clunky, obscure, and sterile.  It ultimately feels more like homework than a wargame.", "date": "Aug 12, 2002"}
