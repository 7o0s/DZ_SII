Launched into the coin-op market in December 1997, the game didn't muster the faithful 2D Street Fighter legions, but instead attracted a handful of fighters and general gameplayers who were charmed with the battalion of 3D characters, colorful animation, quick learning curve, and a special set of special moves.  Almost a year later, Capcom brings us a two-disc game to the PlayStation with a slightly convoluted, overlapping set of features, but one that's true to the original.   The storyline is overwrought with tragedy and saga, as a group of angry, young misunderstood teens set out to overturn their dark fate. In high schools all across Japan, mysterious events have injured people and taken fateful turns, and yet no one in the administrations or any group of students has taken responsibility. As parents, the government, and administrations sit paralyzed with fear, a special set of students has decided to take the future into its own hands.  Rival Schools is a great example of how well Capcom can port over any of its fighting titles. The game maintains a solid frame rate with barely a missed piece of animation, and its characters all respond with near-immediate moves.   The two-disc set is split into the ~arcade-perfect~ disc, complete with the arcade mode (and accompanying story), Training, Options, and Versus (two humans against one another), and disc two, the Evolution Disc. This disc contains a truckload of very similar features: Lesson Mode (in which you can earn points by copying moves perfectly), Group (select two to four characters for a group battle), League (choose two to six characters and then fight in a league battle), Tournament (tournament battle with up to eight characters), Cooperate (four-player simultaneous player), one-player game, and a specialized versus mode.   What sets Rival Schools apart from other fighters are a few old-school tricks done well. Teaming up with another character, you can call in your pal for a special damaging attack that's usually entertaining, and can be increased for deathly damage. The Burning Vigor Attack is a ~youthful~ burst of energy enabling a special attack, such as Shomo's Hundred Balls or Boman's Best Rush. The two minor techniques special to the game are Dodges (side-stepping), and Rival Launcher, which pans out the camera, enabling mid-air combos, attacks, and counters.   Finally, players can get to grips with four-player action using a multitap or two. You can switch your characters in each round, and in Tournament mode, as many as eight can have at it.  For Capcom fans, Rival Schools is not a let-down in the least, and it introduces as many as many as 20 new characters into the Capcom character vaults. While the fighting is solid, fast-moving, and skill-based, many people will tire of the constant special attacks, which all too often feel cheap.Rival Schools is a high production affair, with excellent looking graphics and a solid set of fighting techniques. Characters are relatively well-balanced, and the side-stepping works well to counter hasty opponents. The only thing I didn't like about Rival Schools is the too-oft used Burning Vigor Attack. Fewer projectiles, and more hands-on fighting is my style, and that's why Street Fighter Collection 2 always brings me back to bliss after a bout of Rival Schools. Capcom left the Japanese voices and inserted English subtitles, a classy move that will make many hard-core gamers happy. (Especially after the long hours of debate your have all had in the Letters section.) The character voices are crisp and dramatic, overwrought with Japanese tones and feelings. The Evolution disc seems a little too much, since the tournament, group, league and cooperate are all very similar, but that's OK, because it's clear Capcom spent a lot of time working on producing a specialized home version, and I am always thankful for that. The more the better. My biggest complaint is the characters, who are typecast athletes, punks, and other over-the-top students. None of them are especially charming or worth yearning to play, and I'm not that sure I would rejoice if Rival Schools 2 should burst onto the arcade scene anytime in the next 20 years. Do I really want to play as a school administrator? (There are a few exceptions, such as Sakura and Shoma, who are very likeable.)Lastly, I love 3D fighters as much as 2D fighters, and dodging and attacking in the 3D landscape works great in Rival Schools. I also dig the mid-air attacks, like those in latter-day Capcom fighters, and the counters. All in all, Rival Schools is a damn fine game.", "date": "Oct 27, 1998"}
