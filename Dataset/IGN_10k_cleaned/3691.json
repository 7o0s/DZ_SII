It usually takes a solid sense of speed to make a racing game succeed, and, well, cellphone games are not exactly known for operating at anything resembling high velocity.  Publisher Mforma, undaunted by such possible limitations, has released Crazy Racer into the handset gaming arena, and we put the padel to the metal to see if this racer is fast, or if paying for download leaves you furious.  Features: Ten courses Garage-full of vehicles from bikes to tanks  Crazy Racer is a top-down racer, which immediately puts it at odds with 95% of the gaming population, who look at Out Run and Ridge Racer as the pinnacle of arcade-style racing--not Turbo.  While those racers used to be tops--mainly because that's all that was available--it's impossible to sell a racer as anything but 3-D.  Perhaps cellphone gamers won't mind, though, as they're already well-acquainted with the limitations of their handset.  3-D gaming phones are still a ways off, as Nokia's N-Gage doesn't even launch until this October.  So, in the meantime, Crazy Racer has a shot at grabbing a decent share of downloads before it's blown out of the water.  Crazy Racer is a series of sprints, divided up into ten different tracks of varying length.  As you zip across the countryside, you must keep an eye out for other vehicles or the road.  Run into another bike or car, and you take damage.  Deplete your damage meter at the bottom of the screen, and you're vehicle goes boom.  (Fortunately, you can continue from start of the race you just lost, instead of having to go all the way back to the beginning of the entire game.)  Your vehicle can also take damage by running off the track.  Not that you actually, run off the track.  You just brush against an invisible wall and your phone starts to vibrate.  Control is perhaps Crazy Racer's biggest obstacle, as it inexplicably requires you to press up on your touch pad to accelerate.  Of course, you press to the left or right to swerve.  That means you have to let of the gas to swerve, they immediately press up again to get back to full speed.  Oops.  Bad call, as that it perhaps the most counter-intuitive way to set up controls on a racer.  Should you manage to get a handle of the controls and complete three races, you go back to the garage and select a new car.  The better you do in the game, the more vehicles you unlock.  You start out with a simple bike, but if you negotiate the straightaways correctly (and it's all straightaways) you can unlock F-1 cars and massive tanks.  Crazy Racer isn't a bad looking game.  In fact, it will remind you of an old NES or Master System racer, which is charming in its own right.  The courses are colorful, and the vehicles are decently detailed.  Nothing that will make you uninstall Splinter Cell so you can have two copies of Crazy Racer, though.  Surprisngly, Crazy Racer actually has a decent amount of music in it.  A quick ditty plays when you boot up the game and when you start racing.  Oddly enough, though, the same loop of music plays again when you crash into something.  Strangely dramatic, but it works.Crazy Racer really could have been a sweet throwback to the 8-bit racing days, but the bad controls scheme really torpedos the whole affair.  Nimble fingers might be able to get around it long enough to unlock some of the cars, but anybody who actually sticks with it to the point of getting the tank has patience that deserves respect.", "date": "Jun 2, 2003"}
