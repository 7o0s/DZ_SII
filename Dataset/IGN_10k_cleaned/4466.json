Sure, JAMDAT's Tony hawk releases have been decent -- but that's about it. We've played some pooperrific skiing and snowboarding games in our time. It seems that Activision and Airborne understood that the current gen of cellies just don't have the guts to capture the mountain spirit, so they slowed things down until the tech catches up.  Features:  Create snowboard park Multiple park pieces Manage park resources  If Airborne and Activision were hell-bent on releasing something that had to do with snowboarding, Snowboard Park Tycoon was the right way to go. It completely side-step the problems plaguing other X-games releases.  You are the manager of a new snowboard park. It's your job to manage all of the parks resources and eventually turn this plain-jane resort into a powdery paradise. All you need is a little intuition, a lot of luck, and a half-pipe.  You begin with a clean slate of a mountainside. Using your initial meager funds, select from a variety of park pieces, such as bumps, jumps, grind rails, and half-pipes. Place them about the park in a fashion that will excite and intrigue the lemming-like snowboarders.  The better your piece placement, the more buzz tour restore generates -- resulting in greater cash flow. What to do with that green? Reinvest it in the resort, upgrading facilities and installing new attractions. Pretty soon, you'll have the 'boarders lining up shred your slope.  Snowboard Park Tycoon will remind many gamers of that other capitalism-sim, Lemonade Tycoon. It's an apt comparison, and a compliment to Snowboard Park Tycoon. Both work the same way, managing resources from day to day. You must always keep on eye on performance and cash flow if you want to keep your resort out of the red.  Snowboard Park Tycoon is exactly something of a looker, but it's visuals certainly get the job done. Understandably, the developers were hamstrung by the actual colors of a snowy mountain -- white and light blue -- but sometimes the colors seem washed out on a handset screen. Is that a jump or a bump?  But what matters most is whether or not the game is fun, and in the case of Snowboard Park Tycoon, feel assured that your five bucks isn't buying yellow snow. Action gamers should steer clear, but vidders with a mind for moolah will surely get a kick out of designing the ultimate shredder's paradise. Activision and airborne deserve kudos for this slick alternative to other under-achieving extreme sports titles. The amount of options in Snowboard Park Tycoon is certainly impressive, considering that the game doesn't make a huge footprint in your handset's limited memory. I enjoyed it for what is was, but I must make a slight confession, the end result was that I wanted to go download Lemonade Tycoon again. It just has more personality.", "date": "Feb 18, 2004"}
