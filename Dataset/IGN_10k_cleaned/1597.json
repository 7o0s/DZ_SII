Up until 1998 EA really was outclassed by the stellar Konami team that created International Superstar Soccer, and ever since then, it's been a back and forth tug of war. The fact is that both games play well now, but it's time to move onto the PlayStation 2 (as EA has done in the West) and see what can be achieved there. Why? Because while this season's FIFA 2001 Major League Soccer has been updated for this year, the game isn't too much different from last year's iteration.   Gameplay For those who have played the last two years of FIFA, there really isn't much new gameplay here. Only the most subtle of changes have altered the game's look, while almost nothing has affected its play. The immediately noticeable changes are the improved player texture details, and the increased number of animations per players. These are quite intricate. The ball hits a player's chest and he automatically drops it down into the perfect dribbling location. Headers and bicycle kicks animate well and are motion-captured perfectly, given the PS's limitations. Dribbling animations are better, too. There are more of them, and so the realism is greater. These modifications create a better looking and a smoother playing game than ever before.   But, as opposed to FIFA 99, in which players saw a huge jump in the pace of the game and the players' sense of speed, FIFA 2000 and this year's FIFA 2001 have actually slowed down a tad. Yep. Play them back to back and you will see and feel that the speedy but choppy animation of 99 was replaced by better, smoother animations in 2000, and in 2001, FIFA has even better textures, as well as different size players. But with more textures and more character detail comes a slowing up of the game's overall pace. Players aren't as quick and the action isn't quite as frenetic. I'm talking milliseconds here, but the slowdown is there. To be fair, this game looks a lot better than FIFA 99, and a little bit better looking than 2000, and the gameplay isn't tainted because of it.   FIFA 2001 features more than 50 national teams, including US, England, France, Holland, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Japan, and Italy, plus 17 top leagues including Major League Soccer (MLS), the English Premiere League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Premiere League, Italian Series A, and the French LNF. It also has multiple gameplay modes including Friendly play, Leagues, Cups and Custom modes. What that means is the depth of selection is unprecedented. It's awesome. Players can pit any team anywhere in the world against a traditional or new team, in a traditional or new league. That's pretty damn cool, whether you like the MLS or the Italian leagues.   What EA also has done to create even more authenticity than before is to gain access to the FIFPro License. This license enables EA to include all the names and likenesses of the members of the player association. So, for all of the players (not just FIFPro players), these additions mean real player heights and girths, and it also means that player faces are more detailed animated with life-like facial features. The same goes for realistic facial hair and hair color.   All of the same moves from last year's game, simple and advanced, appear in FIFA 2001, including the shield (R1), hurdle (L2), 360 spin (R2), the side-foot shot (X), and defensive tactics such as off-side trap (R2). The pass-through is still there, cleanly knicked from ISS, and it's useful against the toughest of teams, but in scoring situations, it's relatively risky. I don't use any of these regularly except for the 360 spin, but all work with a bit of practice.   The weirdest thing about FIFA 2001 and even FIFA 2000 is that EA has managed to wipe out almost all of he multiplayer features. FIFA 99 was an eight-player game, whereas FIFA 2000 was a four-player game, and now FIFA 2001 is only two-player. Are you FIFA fans enraged? Or did you ever even use that function? Personally, the real game here is a one on one with a skilled friend in two-player; I don't miss the eight-player function too much.    And if you want to know if the weird skating problems have been eliminated, the answer is no. Occasionally, players look like they're skating on the grass. They're not as bad as before, but they're still there.   Graphics The graphics are as good as they're going to get on PS. The character textures have been refined with more shading, the real uniforms look better than before, and the animation, as I have said before, is good. But despite better looking faces and newer details, these players won't become more human until they have more than one finger. Take a look at those hands, folks. They are paddles, my friends, giant hand flippers, perfectly equipping these ~soccer players~ for swimming across any major river or lake twice as fast as any five-fingered human. These soccer players could make great Olympic swimmers...  The game does feature great animations. Have I said that enough? It's filled with great goalie saves, with several variations of blocks, from spectacular diving catches to close-up blocks in which the ball bounces off his hands onto the ground, and then sliding blocks.  The crowd is still a flat multicolored thing, so that hasn't changed. But the refs and all of the players in the yellow and red card cut-scenes as well as the replay cut-scenes look detailed and are well-animated. Strangely enough, the replays in the PS version of the game are better than the PS2 version. Strange, that. Occasionally, there is a glitch in the ref carding, several times a player got an ~invisible card,~ but it's not a big deal.   Sound As has become the trend with EA, the company has once again secured a popular band to grace the latest version of its game. This year it's Moby and his friends, with Bodyrock.  Other bands include Utah Saints (Power to the Beats, Funky Music), Grand Theft Audio (We Luv You), Curve (Chinese Burn), and the Source (Fly Away). This is music I can get my ear around, to so speak, so it's get two fins up. :) It sounds as if Paul Oakenfold has been clipped from the PS version of the game, which is a big fin down. The crowds are great, too, but I haven't noticed any major changes since the last game, so I can't say there are any big changes.Having played oodles of FIFA in the last few weeks I have to say that I like FIFA a lot, but I also miss ISS. I mean, FIFA has strong arcade feel, and a good solid foundation, but it's technically better in many ways. I know Chris Carle (who reviewed the last two versions) and I disagree on a few points regarding ISS, so there is a discrepancy in our opinions. But I like both games, and he really likes FIFA. But alas, I digress. The latest PS version of FIFA is probably the pinnacle of the series on the PS. It's great in all of the areas that it should be and can be without EA having completely ripped the guts from the old game and remade it altogether. So, I can honestly say that FIFA 2001 is a damn fine game without any guilt or remorse. The animations are great, the sense of speed is solid, and the overall sense of the game is comprised of refinement and depth. And the animations are great. Really.", "date": "Dec 6, 2000"}
