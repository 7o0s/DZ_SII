Of course, it helped that the arena was still fairly nebulous, with a smattering of offerings from SEGA Mobile and a few second-tier publishers. With just a couple releases, Sorrent set the bar for future wireless sports games to meet -- and as of yet, the only company to best Sorrent's first batch of sports games is Sorrent itself.  Features: Deep offensive playbook Five defensive sets First-person football  We enjoyed the first FOX Sports Football, calling it ~an entirely competent, able alternative for footbal nuts that can't manage to take NFL2K3 or Madden with them wherever they go.~  The same can ,and will, be said about Sorrent's 2004 iteration of the game.  Now, it must be mentioned, that this is a straight follow-up of the first game -- very little has been changed with how the game plays. It seems the main upgrades are in the visuals and the AI.  Everything looks a little bit better, and the computer (should you choose to play against the computer) is a little bit smarter. Both very welcome additions, but we can't help wishing there was more. Monumental updates to games usually justify another purchase. Minimal upgrades, well, they beg previous owners to ask whether or not they can make due with what they have.  Of course, it helps that this is a handset game.  It's easier to justify the purchase for a very similar game because it's only five bucks, as opposed to the full fifty you pay for a console sports game update. And we all know how easy it is to get burned on that front. Updated rosters, a few new jerseys, period.  For new initiates, FOX Sports Football '04, plays like a slick side game of football. The perfect go-go complement to whatever console footballer you prefer. The action happens strictly from the first-person.  As the quarterback, you must constantly try to advance the ball through a series of successful passes.  First, you choose a play from your thirty-eight play book, then hit the field. The receivers are numbered one through three. As you pull back for the throw, watch to see who's being covered and who might be left in the wide open. Press the number associated to the receiver, and pray for the computer to not pull of a miraculous interception. Should you wait too long, windows of opportunity close, and the number above the receiver's head is replaced by an X. If everybody is haloed by an X, you better throw the ball and pray for an incomplete pass. Getting sacked means lost yards.  On defense, you have far fewer plays to choose from, but the set-up is pretty similar. When you feel you players are in the right position, press that backer's number and try to block or intercept the ball.  One of the slight changes to FOX Sports Football '04 is that the playing field is wider. You can now use the touch pad to look left and right and get a far better view of the action. The animations are also far better in this new version. Before, when the players got too far down the field, everything became a mess of jumbled sprites. Now, FOX Sports Football, keeps the action closer by not shrinking the sprites down, you just have to figure out in your head how long you've been looking at the running animation to get an idea of how far down the field the players are.  Sounds cheesy, but it's way better than a mess of blocky players and Xs.FOX Sports Football '04 is a good follow-up to Sorrent's groundbreaking original, offering slightly better game play and improved visuals.  I would say ~excellent,~ but I can't help wishing there was more to the update.  Of course, buying this update only sets you back five-six bucks, as opposed to the $50 SEGA and EA Sports want for their updates. If you haven't already bought into the franchise and are a total football freak, hesitate not.  Get yourself to your phone and make with downloading.  But if you already have the original, consider if there isn't another game you'd rather spend the five bucks or.  FOX Sports Boxing, maybe?", "date": "Oct 4, 2003"}
