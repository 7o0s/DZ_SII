If you're into that whole strikes and spares deal, you're probably interested in which one is the better version. Well, read on, my faithful pocket reader, and find out which Game Boy Color cartridge should end up in your equipment bag with your oddly colored shoes and dirty white towel. Features One or Two players Tournament, Training, or Open bowling Multiple characters, left or right hand Password save For Game Boy or Game Boy Color  Pocket Bowling is another arcade-style bowling game for the Game Boy system. Even so, a lot of effort went into making the game as complete as possible. You can jump right in and play a one or two player game of bowling. And once you've practiced up enough, you can take your character all the way through a password backed-up tournament to find out who's the real bowling champ.  To bowl, you align your ball along the edge of the alley  once you've picked your spot, hit the A button to get the curve meter bouncing. When the meter's at the curve intensity you want, hit the A button again to set the power meter swinging. Push the A button at the point where you want the power (the higher on the meter you go, the harder the throw). Then, time the downswing as close to the end as possible. Get all that? Good. Now you just need to find the sweet spot that'll get you the strike every time.   In Pocket Bowling, the programmers went the right way and made each of the ten pins an individual sprite. In this case, you can see each pin react to the ball nailing it. The physics are not nearly as good as, say, Ten Pin Alley or Brunswick Bowling on the PlayStation. But without the necessary floating point math processor for true-life physics, the Game Boy programmers have to fake how each pin reacts with each other. Hey, them's the breaks.  The game features five characters, each with his or her own strengths. Some have better control, while others have better power. And any game that lets you play as a giant penguin is A-OK in my book. And what's more, you can go into the practice mode and set up any conceivable pin lie and try to pick it up in one shot. Out of the two bowling games on the Game Boy Color, this one is definitely the winner. As bowling games go, there is certainly room for improvement  but as it stands, Pocket Bowling is the choice for the 10-pin diversion.", "date": "Oct 5, 1999"}
