It's been over three years since MechWarrior 2 was released and, while gamers had Mercenaries and Ghost Bear's Legacy to hold them over in the interim, everyone has yearned to play an entirely revamped sequel.  Well, the wait is over.  MechWarrior 3 has made its way out the door and onto store shelves.  I was a huge fan of MechWarrior 2, so I was kind of wary to see the license transferred to a new developer.  But I have to admit that I am  incredibly impressed with Zipper Interactive's foray into the giant robot sim category.  This one is simply amazing.  The most obvious improvement in MechWarrior 3 is the stunning graphics engine, highlighted by realistic looking fire, chunky explosions, remarkable lighting effects, deep footprints, beautiful smoke and a scrolling sky with authentic looking clouds.  Of course, this game is about BattleMechs, and Zipper doesn't disappoint in this arena either.  Rather than piloting the blocky mechs of yore, these behemoths are incredibly detailed and look better than any other robot sim to date, with rounded edges and appendages that actually move and flex.  Unlike the previous 'Mech games, when you take a hard hit in MechWarrior 3 you don't just see a burst of light and continue to move at top speed.  MechWarrior 3 attempts to accurately simulate damage (well, as accurately as you can portray something that's set over 1,000 years in the future) so, if you get an arm blown off, you'll see a mass of twisted metal and dangling wires hanging from your shoulder.  You'll even see your ripped appendages on the battlefield.  And if you get hit too many times in the leg your 'Mech will limp slowly until you get repaired.  In addition, 'Mechs can now fall down and get back up, which means that just because you drop a foe doesn't mean that he won't show up to cause trouble later.   Scenery also looks incredible. For the first time you'll feel like you're in a four story, 80 ton bipedal vehicle of mass destruction on an inhabited planet rather than a random ball of ice floating through the cosmos.  In addition to some really magnificent buildings, there are loads of real world objects like docks, bridges and even a few hapless pedestrians running around just ripe for a good steppin' on.  This really gives you a sense of scale since you tower over the teenie-tiny humans as they aimlessly try to outrun your 'Mech.  Zipper has even included a few nice interior settings, so all of the combat action isn't just about out turning and outrunning your opponents.  You'll actually have to use a little more strategy when you're indoors.      MechWarrior 3 doesn't disappoint in the sound department, either.  The voice-overs are clean, clear and crisp, the soundtrack is a good mix of heart-pumping tracks and dramatic mood-setting music and the thud of your 'Mechs feet as you traverse the terrain is ground-shaking.  You can clearly tell the difference between a light, fast 'Mech and a heavy 'Mech just from the sound of its steps and you'll definitely want to pump up your subwoofer on this one so you can hear as well as feel the rumble.  Those of you with 3D sound are in for a particular treat as the folks at Zipper did a particularly good job with locational sound cues.    Of course, a game can't rely on good graphics and sound alone.  Even with all of this eye candy, there's no lack of top-notch performance.  MechWarrior 3 looks beautiful and plays smoothly even on lower end systems, especially if you have a 3D accelerator.  I pumped up the resolution to 1024 x 800 on a 266MHz machine with a single Voodoo2 card and could tell no major performance difference between it and a Voodoo3 enhanced PII450.  Gameplay in this sequel is remarkably similar to MechWarrior 2, which is rather surprising given that the two games were created by two different software developers.  But if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Anyone familiar with MechWarrior 2 will be able to jump right into this one and, even if you're a novice, MechWarrior 3 is surprisingly easy to pick up given the number of different commands.  While I liked the feel of a force feedback joystick while playing MechWarrior 3, I found it easiest to play using a mouse/keyboard combination.  You just can't beat the mouse for precise aiming at long range.  While the basic mechanics of the game haven't changed, Zipper Interactive has spiced up the series with a few new features.  The most notable (and most useful) is the addition of a zooming reticule which makes picking off long-range targets easier than ever.  Instead of being a lone MechCommander taking on the entire universe, you'll have direct control over a few support 'Mechs.  While the command list for Lancemates isn't extensive, you can now order your buddies to attack, defend, follow or return to your Mobile Field Bases (MFBs). The MFBs, which follow you to each successive battle area, are extremely helpful as they can repair you in the field and carry your spoils of battle. Instead of just being handed a new mech when you finish a particular mission, in MechWarrior 3 you'll pick weapons, ammo, counter-measures, heat sinks, etc. from your fallen foes on the battlefield after each mission. Your MFBs will serve as holding space until you're ready to use a particular item.  And, in case you're wondering, your MFBs will also repair some of the enemy 'Mechs you disable during skirmishes so you can pilot them in later missions.    Heat is also handled a little bit differently in this sequel.  Your weapons will still cause your 'Mech to heat up but, in emergencies, you can flush some of your coolant for a quick cool down.  Plus, with the addition of water in MechWarrior 3, you can take a swim to dissipate heat more quickly.  Unfortunately for MechWarrior 3, the multiplay options don't live up to the single player game.  Sure, you can play against up to seven other MechWarriors, but only in deathmatch games.  It's fun if you're the kind of person who only wants to go toe-to-toe with other MechWarriors.  It's been a quick diversion around the office, but it's certainly nothing special.   Besides the lacking pultiplay options, you may be wondering if there's anything else wrong with MechWarrior 3.  Well, there are a few problems, but nothing that really reaches out and grabs you.  The worst downfall lies in the in AI.  Many of the patrolling enemies will continue to walk back and forth even after you hit them with a few missiles, so it's not much of a challenge to take them out from long range.     In the end, I can't say enough good things about MechWarrior 3.  It's got everything to keep gamers happy and is a perfect complement to the already popular MechWarrior universe.  Zipper Interactive has certainly proven that they have the skills to pay to bills.  If this is the evolution of the MechWarrior series, we can't wait to see MechWarrior 4!  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jun 5, 1999"}
