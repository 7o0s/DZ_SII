For the follow-up, then, the development team could focus on refining the established formula  the character was already in place, now he just needed more to do. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 offered more of everything. More characters, more levels. More music, moves and baddies to beat. It improved on every aspect of the original and rightfully claimed a place at the top of the Genesis 16-bit library. This is one of Sega's best.   At its onset, much of Sonic 2 looks the same  it's a side-scrolling platformer again, with the same rolling hills, green landscapes and looping curves. But noticeably different right away is that Sonic's not alone. A new tag-along sidekick character, Miles ~Tails~ Prower, has joined up with the hero. Tails is a twin-tailed fox who doesn't serve any specific purpose in the default single player mode, but going through an options screen allows you to select to play as only him.   Tails controls similarly to Sonic, with a few minor differences  the major change, you'd think, would be his ability to spin his two tails like a helicopter to fly around the levels. You're not given control of that power, though. That would be an innovation left for Sonic the Hedgehog 3.   So the introduction of the sidekick was more meant for multiplayer, a new head-to-head feature that the original Sonic adventure didn't have. 2 Player Vs. mode here in Sonic 2 splits the screen horizontally, and compresses the graphics of each player's half in odd, distorting ways. It's still a fun and innovative idea, though, and one Sega can say they did better than Nintendo  Mario and Luigi could never run competitively through the same levels, at the same time.   Sonic got an addition to his moveset beginning in this game  the Spin Dash. Activated by crouching down and then holding the jump button, Sonic will spin in place until you release the pressure on the trigger  after which, he takes off like a rocket. The move enhanced the speed of the gameplay, as Sonic no longer had to have a long stretch of straightaway to get up to his signature blazing velocity any more.   And there's a greater variety of levels for him to blaze right through. Sonic 2 changed the level layout structure of zones and stages  for most of this game, now, there will be only two levels with the same background style before the speedster blasts off to another distinctive area.  So it's more, more and more. That's Sonic the Hedgehog 2, all summed up. It's a true sequel to an established hit game  taking the characters, gameplay and overall feel of the original and enhancing each one. Sonic 2 became even more of a hit than its predecessor, probably thanks to word of mouth praising the first game and converted fans wanting to get in on the ground floor once the sequel hit. And because this one was such a big seller in its original release, it's since been included in a wealth of retro re-releases and classics compilations. This Virtual Console version is an easy thumbs-up, as the game itself is spectacular. But check to make sure you don't already own this same game in five other ways first  because, if so, you may want to use those 800 Wii Points for another purpose.", "date": "Jun 11, 2007"}
