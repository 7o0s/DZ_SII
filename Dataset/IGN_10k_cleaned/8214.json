It often falls to the France-based mobile maker to release mobile editions of Ubi's console games, such as the recent Rayman Raving Rabbids and Rainbow Six Vegas. Flanking the recent Xbox 360 release of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2 (GRAW2), Gameloft wades into the mobile battlefield with its own future-soldier. While there obviously should be no literal comparison of play mechanics between the two, can Gameloft's smallest screen shooter at least approximate the atmosphere and tension of the new-gen GRAW2?   In the future, the world is still a mess. Hostilities at the border between the United States and Mexico have flared to the breaking point. A terrorist organization is now threatening the southern states. A massive push-back is not feasible, so it's up to Captain Mitchell and his elite squad to diffuse the situation. You must lead Mitchell  through a series of stages that are actually fairly challenging from the get-go. That alone is a nice change from the too-easy Vegas.   Since this conflict is waged in the year 2014, you have access to some high-tech gear to augment your trusty arsenal of assault rifles and frag grenades. One such weapon is a satellite that fries a target with pinpoint precision once you line up the virtual crosshairs. You also have an ever-present map that detects heat signatures of enemies several screens over, giving you advanced intel.   The use of cover is a major mechanic in GRAW2. Only idiots -- dead idiots -- run straight into enemy territory with their muzzle blazing. The terrorists are fearless to the point of stupid. This is not meant as an insult to the AI, just an assessment on the mentality between a trained soldier and a desperate warrior with nothing to lose. However, you can use their aggression. You can lead them into the open and then seek out cover while they foolishly unload their magazines. When you see the break in fire, you pop up from behind a wall to pick them off with precision shooting. You can move from    You wouldn't earn the nick Ghost unless you were an expert in stealth. You can sneak up to unsuspecting thugs and knife them. Use the shadows to escape detection. Scan the environment for alternate routes and outmaneuver the enemy. Avoid spotlights that raise alarms.   There are several adrenaline moments in GRAW2 that smartly contrast the methodical shooting and stealth. You will run from a falling barrage of bombs and missiles that scorch the earth only inches behind. You will face off against hulking machines, both wheeled and robotic. You can drive an armored vehicle through enemy formations, shattering the terrorists beneath your crushing tread. Bombs fall around your vehicle as you chew through the hordes with your mounted guns. Ramps send you flying over machinegun nests. These were easy highlights from GRAW2, but in wisely limiting the big pops, you're left wanting more.   There's actually quite a bit going on in GRAW2, but unlike Vegas, mechanics aren't introduced and then dropped here. For example, you can drop into the sewers and sneak around enemies. This happens more than once, unlike the water sneaking you used only one time in Vegas (during the Hoover Dam scene).   Another thing I appreciated: No first-aid. You slowly regenerate health over time and it eliminates the no-longer-fun situations of having to seek out health packs by putting yourself in danger.   It must be pointed out, though, that although it is tougher than Vegas, GRAW2 is still not the biggest challenge you'll find on a handset. If you play the game in easy mode, you'll cakewalk some of the mission. If you want some meat, definitely try a harder difficulty. That said, the game is still a tad on the short side and that affects its overall value. If you're a decent player, you'll get a couple hours out of GRAW2. But that's not enough for some players. You could always go back and replay missions to earn more stars, though.   GRAW2 came to me loaded on a Sony Ericcson w810i. The game looks quite good, although the frame rate did stutter when things moved quickly. The truck run was the biggest culprit. I'd roar up to a jump while blasting enemies just to. Have the. Screen. Kinda stop suddenly. Like the game was. Thinking about the next. Set of. Enemies.   The environments are nicely detailed. There are cobblestone streets. Chicken peck the dust and flee as you approach. The game employs some excellent color choices, too. The dusty scenarios make the blue HUD really stand out. There is some solid music that gives way to gun pops when you are on a mission.  Being a big fan of the GRAW franchise on my Xbox 360, I went into the mobile GRAW2 with a different set of expectations. I wasn't looking for Gameloft to offer the same degree of tactics. What I wanted was for the scenario, atmosphere, and weaponry to match up -- but also offer something new, such as the balls-out armored truck runs. As such, the mobile GRAW2 nicely compliments the console game. If you're looking for some mobile action with a healthy dose of brains and don't mind the relative brevity of the game, make GRAW2 a double-header with the recently released 300.", "date": "Mar 16, 2007"}
