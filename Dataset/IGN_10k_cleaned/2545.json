The launch of the GBA saw a stylized cartoony action game called Army Men Advance, but the game has returned to its more realistic roots in an overhead, mission-based action game, Army Men: Operation Green. If you've never liked the series, there's not much here to change your mind...but it's a solid effort with a couple of issues that drag out the fun a bit too thin. Features 15 missions Five different environments Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Army Men: Operation Green, developed by Pocket Studios, is very much like the Army Men games produced on the Game Boy Color by Digital Eclipse...but on a much grander scale thanks to the rising expectations of the GBA market. Players take on the role of a lone green soldier, running missions in hostile Tan Army territory...though missions offer different objectives, they pretty much all come down to ~Get to point A, B, and C without getting killed.~ And you're offered a nice arsenal throughout the missions...you can blast your way through the game with your standard handgun, but it's helpful if you track down crates that contain grenades, missiles, and machine gun ammo. By hitting the ~Select~ button, you can cycle through your collection of firepower to use the best weapon at the proper situation. Some locations are swarming with buried mines, and that's where your mine detector comes in handy...though it's limited in how much power it has.   Your character in Army Men controls as if you're moving an on-screen persona in a first-person shooter: left or right on the D-pad rotates the guy, forward and backwards advances and retreats him, and the L and R button are dedicated to a very limited side-stepping motion which stops after one slight step in the direction you pushed. A handy on-screen crosshair shows the direction your character's facing and aiming...and it doubles as a target for lobbing grenades as well.  Graphically, the folks at Pocket Studios did a nice job for the first ~realistic~ Army Men game, producing an engine that can handle a lot of on-screen enemies, vehicles, and bullets, without any slowdown. The engine can also handle an absolutely massive map for the battlefield, which can take quite a while to make it from one end to another. There are some issues with priority overlapping; character sprites will sometimes pop in front of objects they're supposed to be behind and vice versa...something that another couple tweaking sessions should have ironed out.  There are some really neat ideas for attacks, like the gatling guns atop a tower or in an overhead helicopter, spitting out fast-moving bullets that are represented by the sand kicking up on the ground. The sense of 3D is a bit lost when trying to take out these towers, since you have to alter your perception and aim your gun to the ground above them in order to actually hit them with grenades, rockets, or bullets. And the sounds are pretty well done, with outstanding digitized samples and decent (albeit repetitive) music during levels.  But the biggest issues in this game: some missions take way too long to complete, especially when you can only save your game between missions...the maps are so darn big, and the password engine isn't detailed enough to save your progress in the middle of a level.  Halving some of the missions into sub-missions would have spaced out the game a bit better than it is. But on the flipside, some later missions are an absolute joke to complete...most of Army Men: Operation Green is pretty easy to finish overall, so it's a short trek through massive maps. It's a strange balance. Army Men games have a bad rep on other systems, but they turn out pretty okay on the Game Boy system. This Game Boy Advance game is relatively fun, but some levels drag on way too long...with others that are a snap to complete. Not to mention that 15 missions designed in Army Men: Operation Green aren't enough to make the game last longer than a couple days of play. It's a better than average action game, though, with some good gameplay ideas in place. It just needs some missions with better designs.", "date": "Mar 11, 2002"}
