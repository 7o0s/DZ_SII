We've already got Tetrisphere and Magical Tetris Challenge, not to mention Bust-A-Move. Well, here's your reason: Four-player competitive action, baby.GameplayThe latest Amtex-developed variation on Pajitnov's million-selling series doesn't change much in the ways of gameplay. Blocks in multiple shapes still drop from above and have to be lined up at the bottom to create uninterrupted lines to clear them away, but there is one marked difference between Tetris 64 (aka Bio Tetris) and the rest of the bunch. Bio feedback. You read correctly, Bio Feedback.First shown at the Nintendo Spaceworld in '97, Tetris 64 directly responds to a player's bio rhythm by measuring blood pressure through an included ear clip. It all sounds like an April Fool's joke, but Seta has packed in a device with a cord and an earclip about the size of a regular N64 memory pack. Called 'Bio Sensor', you attach it to your ear while playing the game, and the game adapts to your heartbeat.When playing in Bio Tetris mode, there are two basic settings for the feedback function. Normal makes the game easier if you get more excited (or nervous), resulting in slower dropping pieces and a more relaxed gamer. Reverse, or maybe they should call it ~heart attack~ speeds up the pace of the game as your heart accelerates. While this may all sound incredibly exciting, it really isn't all that great. Truth to be told, the bio sensor is a neat little gimmick for health freaks, but it doesn't really add much to the whole gameplay experience. It's a cool extra, but we wouldn't want to pay extra to get it.There are three selectable Tetris variants included in Tetris 64 (each with the traditional three sub-types, A, B, and C): Tetris: Clear lines with the standard Tetris blocks. Background images change once in a while and the game gets gradually faster. Giga Tetris: An excellent variation on the old theme drops down supersized tetraeds that can be broken up into smaller parts. Great fun. Bio Tetris: This is the only gameplay mode that works with the bio sensor. Although the style is similar to regular Tetris, a graphical heart display shows your bio rhythm. If it speeds up, the heart turns an unhealthy whitish blue. If you're relaxed, it pulses in deep red.MultiplayerThis really needed to be mentioned separately. While most puzzle games still haven't made the step into the four-player arena, Tetris 64 manages to do so and delivers the best possible multiplayer gameplay. Four players can share the screen in any of the three modes. Every time you complete two rows or more at once, you earn a block mark below your screen. With the R and the L buttons you can pick your victim from the other three players and send one ~crap row~ with the press of a button. The cool thing is that you can stock up on blocks and then send a number of rows by repeatedly tapping the button. You can imagine how fun it is to get screwed by your friends -- only to retaliate with a whole barrage of lines a few minutes later. It may be a bit unfair when an expert player goes up against a novice (despite handicap settings), but once everyone's up to speed you will experience outstanding multiplayer gameplay that never lets up.GraphicsGraphically, Tetris 64 is as straightforward as they come. Instead of going with a specific theme, like Capcom's Disney-based Tetris Challenge, Tetris 64 uses photographic images, such as scenery and landmarks. Sadly, Seta didn't try anything to elevate this installment over its predecessors. No special effects -- just pure Tetris. This could have been done just as well on the Super NES.SoundThe game's jazzy tunes sound pretty cool at first, but they get old too quickly. The one-player mode offers the choice of such eclectic tracks as ~Warmer,~ ~CD-Wood,~ ~Five-Q,~ and ~Street,~ but the multiplayer music will have you reaching for the (thankfully built-in) volume within minutes. Leave the sound effects on and play your favorite CD instead.Manual/On-screen TextIncredibly, all on-screen text is in English. The manual is in Japanese, but the gameplay styles and connection of the bio sensor are easily figured out.Seta has put together an amazing multiplayer title that's a blast to play. Although it lacks the style and presentation of Capcom's Magical Tetris Challenge, it plays faster and offers the best four-player puzzle mode to date. If you're itching to play four-player Tetris and you don't mind 16-bit graphics and lackluster sound, don't hesitate to pick this one up. Even months after its release, this remains one of the most-played puzzle games in the office.However, I'm still waiting for that one puzzle title that combines great graphics and sound with the same simple, but incredible Tetris gameplay.
