Staying on top of the sports market isn't just a matter of being first with these guys. Every single one of their existing sports titles has been gone over with a fine toothed comb to make sure that the game will boast better graphics, gameplay and features than any of its competition in the genre. Every single game but one, that is. With their new Deer Hunt Challenge, EA Sports has apparently jumped into a market that they either don't fully respect or don't fully understand offering up a project that ultimately has less appeal than any of the big contenders currently available.  It starts with the concept of the game itself. Deer Hunt Challenge is at its heart an attempt to boil hunting down into quick action sequences that won't bore players with all that stalking around in the woods looking for stuff, or to put it more clearly, all that hunting. In the challenge mode (there is a regular hunting mode, but we'll get to that in a second), you're given a quick overview of the animals you can expect to see when the mission begins. All of the weapons and equipment are pre-selected for you as is the prey you'll be stalking (actually the game only boasts one potential target as far as I could see, but I don't have any issues with that). Most of these challenges set you up so that the deer either start right in front of you or will quickly head towards you within the next few minutes. Your job is to kill the biggest buck you can within the parameters that have been set down and then head on to the next mission. While this is fun for the first few minutes, it bears absolutely no resemblance to any sort of real hunting. Worse still, all of these missions are pretty easy. It took me only minutes to work halfway through the available scenarios and that was only because I could never sort out the system for sighting the bow. Which brings up my final gripe with the challenge levels. Since you can't move past a mission until you complete it, if you find a situation that is frustrating you, you'll never be able to play the rest of the game. Let's move on.  So once I had exhausted my patience on Deer Hunt Challenge's challenge mode, I decided to move on to the free hunt option. If this part is good, I argued, the whole challenge thing doesn't make any difference. Sadly it wasn't. While Deer Hunt Challenge isn't a bad hunting simulation in its free mode, it's certainly not a particularly good one  which is not nearly good enough to stand up against the stiff competition that is coming down the pipe. In addition to having graphics that I would equate with second generation hunting games, Challenge doesn't offer very much at all in the way of calls, scents or other equipment (although I did like the way the game handles blind set up). Movement is sluggish, safety training is not a priority (you can run while looking down the barrel of a gun), and the deer AI seems to react to nearly all situations in the same way. After a few hours of this one I had to play Deer Hunter 3 for a couple of days just to remind myself why I play these titles in the first place.  In the end, all this fuss is over a $20 game in a flooded market. Why should I care if one more company slings out a hunting title in an attempt to grab the Wal-Mart crowd's cash at Christmas time? It's because of what EA Sports has meant for over a decade. EA Sports has come to mean that one of the world's most talented design companies has spent the time and energy ensuring that the game you are about to play is the most realistic version of a sport you can hope to see on a computer. While the company didn't design this particular title, they made the decision to put their name on a game that doesn't boast the features and replayability of Deer Hunter 3, the heart and adventure of Ted Nugent's Wild Adventure Hunting and the creativity of Carnivores 2, all of which can be purchased at the same price point. If EA Sports had really put their back behind this one, desktop hunting could have seen a performance jump that might have made other companies think twice about slinging out an inferior product. Instead the market is going to get one more half-assed hunting game that doesn't show any of the innovation or technical artistry we have come to expect from what used to be one of the most reliable names in sports gaming.  -- Trent C.
