Perhaps it was the translation of the console game into the portable version or maybe it was turning the stealth action of the consoles into tactical turn-based card battles.  Whatever it was, there were definitely a lot of people that were unhappy when that piece went up.  So you can imagine my trepidation when I was assigned to cover Metal Gear Acid 2, knowing full well that I was walking into a PSP minefield.   Personally, I wasn't too cowed by reviewing the title: I've played every Metal Gear title on the consoles, so I'm relatively comfortable with the franchise mythology.  I also own the original Metal Gear Acid and have played a lot of it on various trips and occasions.  While I don't think that the game is the best thing in the world, I also don't think that it was extraordinarily slow, poorly paced or unrealistic; Rather, I think it was a good game that was somewhat hampered by some quirky gameplay choices.  Where does that leave the sequel?  Well, fortunately it manages to fix some of the more questionable facets of the game while leaving a large amount of the core game elements the same.  The downside is that the new game features don't radically advance the card battle franchise either.   I think there's something on your face... The story of MGA2, while indefinable in the canon of the Metal Gear Universe, pulls enough strange elements to do Kojima's franchise justice.  An amnesiac Snake is ~enlisted~ to infiltrate SaintLogic Inc., initially on the premise to steal some files, but ultimately to stop a mad scientist who's created a Metal Gear and has access to a load of nuclear missiles.  Threatening to annihilate the US unless certain people are handed over to him unconditionally, this scientist has provided a three hour deadline before he launches his warheads.  Unbeknownst to Snake, he's also wronged this madman, potentially bringing this conflict to a critical point.  Fortunately, he's assisted by a new accomplice, an assassin named Venus who has no compunction with killing anyone in her way of her mission.   One of the nice changes for each stage in MGA2 is that they seem a bit more varied.  Instead of the standard, ~Eliminate all enemies!~ text that you'd find from the original for a majority of the missions, you're now given more diverse tasks like finding sewer openings or protecting minor characters.  Even better is the tweaking of the movement/turning system in the middle of a level.  For example, no longer will you need to expend a separate card to turn Snake or Venus in a specific direction, or even to make them stand or lie down on the ground.  MGA2 allows you to rotate, raise and lower your characters as much as you want as long as you've selected ~move~ with a card.  It also allows both characters free attacks via the newly included CQC, or close quarters combat system.  Once a turn, Snake and Venus can execute a three punch combo which can either knockdown or incapacitate an enemy for a few rounds.   This isn't Snake vs. Zombies?! This move can be used as an offensive set up for a combo, leaving your target immobilized while you pick them off with a weapon or as a defensive move to gather new hands of cards.  The latter can be particularly useful considering that the total number of cards included in the game has been upped significantly; more than 500 separate cards can be found in packs scattered throughout each level.  You will also have the option to purchase a number of cards via the points system based on your performance in each mission, including the original Metal Gear titles in what Acid 2 calls the Chronicle Pack.    For owners of the original Acid, there's actually an option to make your previous adventures stretch a bit farther in the option to import cards and points into your new game.  Obviously, you'll want to pick and choose between the best cards in your deck to get a good start on Acid 2.  However, even if you pick and choose a weaker card, you can modify it thanks to the upgrade system.  Each and every single card can be upgraded via a specific fee to cause more damage, last longer or affect a larger area.  However, there are two definite caveats to doing this -- first of all, depending on the card, you're not necessarily going to find or notice the increase in effect.  A weapon might not cause the increased amount of damage it's promised to, or an area effect won't run as long as it's forecast to.   Similarly, you'll discover that upgrading these cards will often kick their cost amount so high that the extra effects are often not necessarily worth deploying them in the field because it'll take forever for you to get another turn in a heavily packed room.  This can be somewhat problematic because there are a couple of stages where you'll easily face off against four or more guards, who will often call in reinforcements at the slightest hint of trouble.  While it seemed that equipped firearms worked rather well in the first title, they seem to be hampered somewhat in Acid 2, working around 50% of the time or less.  In fact, they were so unreliable as to whether or not they'd be triggered when their specific card conditions were met, that they were much more effective as movement cards whenever they popped up in a deck.   Venus packs a mean gun. Multiplayer winds up exhibiting these hazards particularly well, especially since it will throw you and your opponent into a level without allowing you to tailor your deck or create specific parameters on a match.  This can result in wildly unfair situations with a new player squaring off against a veteran who has a much more stacked deck.  While the idea of taking out soldiers for Pythagoras disks has now been replaced with glowing spheres that can be taken out to win a level, actually destroying these objects is long and tedious.  Not only will they not display a ~life bar,~ they shrug off most area and weapon specific damage.  I wound up using a combination of area attacks, explosives and arms fire on one, only for it to shrug all of them off without a visible scratch.   A huge problem is that there are a couple of nonsensical features with the MGA2 multiplayer, such as continually being able to monitor where your opponent is at all times.  In the original title you could potentially lose someone based on Snake's line of sight.  In MGA2, you can continually monitor where they are after the initial ~setup~ period by zooming out and shifting the camera around the battlefield.  This doesn't wind up enforcing tactics or strategy, because you don't really need one when you know where everyone is at all times; you simply need luck that the right weapon cards come your way when you need them.  I also noticed that when one of my opponents dropped a magazine in front of me, I sprinted right over it without a problem.  Hiccups like this makes the multiplayer mode quickly devolve into a seek and destroy mission for the opposite team before the time limit runs out.     Gun-toting boxes are no match for Snake. There are a couple of additional features that have been thankfully included in MGA 2, such as a guide feature that's continually at your fingertips from the system menu.  There's also an additional Arena mode that can, in most cases, take the place of re-exploring previously completed missions.  In the Arena, you'll have the opportunity to face off against bosses from previous Metal Gear titles.  This includes characters like The Boss, Revolver Ocelot and Vamp.  It's a nice place to test your skills; however, there's a definite balancing problem that crops up with this feature.  Before mission 5 or so, you'll usually wind up getting crushed in the Arena regardless of the difficulty level you play on.  However, once you wind up getting past this point, and especially once Venus joins you, the Arena mode becomes incredibly simplistic.  At one point, I played through the three Arena environments thirty times straight without losing a single match.  Considering that you can rack up a ton of points, this is essentially card farming which is either grinding or important to only those players that have to collect every card.    This can be particularly important if you feel the need to unlock the movies and trailers in the Solid Eye Theater by collecting their corresponding cards.  While you can watch and play these in ~normal vision,~ Acid 2 provides every film in 3D, including the MGS4 trailer completely reconstructed via the included 3D viewer.  It's an extremely cool feature to see movies from Snake Eater or this trailer included in a new perspective.  You can even take images that you've taken with the camera in Subsistence and view them in the Solid Eye Theater, but I will warn you before hand that staring at these or the rest of the regular gameplay in 3D (since you can actually play the whole game with this viewer) for prolonged periods of time can give you a massive headache.  The other strange thing is that some of the movies are full of bikini-clad women doing random things like walking around columns, having a water gun fight or simply staring into the screen.  While I understand and even accept that the included footage may have some purpose that I'm not privy to, the connection between cards and footage just doesn't make any sense, further casting doubt on the feature.  For instance, what the hell does a girl cleaning a gun and a survival knife have in common?   There is something to be said about the redone visuals thanks to the Solid Eye Theater and the ability to play entirely in 3D.  The cel-shaded look of the game stands out a lot more than the original title, with character animation and responses feeling fluid and well defined, albeit cartoonish.  You'll also notice a larger focus with the boss models in the game, especially since there's a lot more of them in MGA2 than the previous game.  Of course, they retain the Metal Gear quirks, such as a guy without a face or a man-ape with detachable arms.  This is somewhat bolstered by a techno soundtrack that takes many of the effects and sounds from the previous Acid game and adds a driving beat to most of the gameplay.  Unfortunately, MGA2 is still missing voiceovers throughout the game, which is a loss compared to other UMDs that are featuring VO work for cinematics and cutscenes.  Let the chugging contest commence! Acid 2 is a good game -- in fact, it's better than the original, but only slightly.  I know that there are many more features included in this game than the previous title, and that the control scheme has been improved significantly.  I also accept that there are a couple of additional modes.  However, thanks to some really strange, confusing traits of play, MGA2 winds up playing almost like a patched version of Acid.  In some ways, much of its play and features are two steps forward in terms of creativity, one step back in terms of execution.", "date": "Mar 22, 2006"}
