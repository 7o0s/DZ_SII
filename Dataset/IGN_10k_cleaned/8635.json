They're stylish, upmarket, neon lit affairs, with food, drink, pool, and even glamour-girl 'darts queens' to add a sprinkling of glitz. In addition to drinking swanky drinks and posh food, you can play darts on an array of super hi-tech boards that automatically take note of your score, and if you score a 180, the whole bar will know thanks to the disco lights that start flashing. So it's not really anything like the real sport of darts, as it's commonly understood in Britain.    Hone your skills to proceed to bigger venues.  As it's understood in Britain, darts is about smoky pubs and rounds of lager. It's about men with mullet haircuts, dodgy moustaches and idiosyncratic sartorial styles being cheered on by toothless crones. It's about Jim Bowen and Bully's Star Prize, and the beer-sodden insides of the Lakeside Leisure Complex (a venue that also hosts amateur mixed martial arts bouts). It's about as far removed from the elegant insides of the Darts Bar Bee as you could possibly imagine. So you'd be forgiven for thinking that SEGA's Touch Darts might not capture the grimy authenticity of the real thing.   But you'd be totally wrong. You might think that darts is a good walk ruined - hang on, that's the other one. You might think that darts is a good drink ruined. If you do, you're unlikely to warm to Touch Darts, because it is darts. It is about as close as you can get to the real thing, which is why it's so utterly, mystifyingly compelling - in spite of its flaws.   The way it works is you touch your stylus against the screen where you plan to aim. Then you drag the stylus down, which determines how hard you're going to throw; and then you flick the stylus up and lift it off the screen, to mimic the throwing action. You aim, pull back, push forward and let go. It's like throwing real darts, and it requires almost as much skill and judgement. It is absolutely convincing. It's difficult to describe how fundamentally the game gets the physics right - how it's so sublimely mimetic of throwing the real thing. But the game's British developer, Full Fat, has imbued this touchscreen input with a real sense of weight and heft. You can pull back gently and let off a delicate, arcing throw, for example, or you can perform more of a punchy throw with just a short pull-back and firm follow-through.    The art style is in keeping with caricatures you might see on the walls of a pub.  In fact, the least convincing aspect of SEGA's simulation is the dart-shaped stylus that they helpfully provided to review the game. And the AI, which is pretty terrible. Early opponents will pepper the board with wayward abandon, which gives you plenty of time to develop your skill and judgement with your touchscreen arrows. But - and this is the game's most serious flaw - they continue to pepper the board with, an unconvincingly haphazard sense of accuracy for well over half of the game, making it easy to breeze through most of it in an afternoon.   The main part of the game is the tournament mode, which sees you playing standard 301 or 501 darts, divided across skill levels: Rookie, Amateur, Pro and Expert (and in case you're from the good-drink-ruined school of darts unappreciation, that means you have to reach 301 or 501 points before your opponent, and you need to finish by hitting the outer-rim of the board - thus scoring a double). Each skill level is further divided across different venues, from Shed, Basement and Bedroom at Rookie level, to Club, Leisure Centre, Wales and Ireland when you reach the penultimate heights of Pro. Obviously, each location features different boards and players, and as you work your way up the matches see you playing for more points, legs and sets.      Most importantly of all, the background noise and crowd chatter gets more pronounced as you move through more popular venues - the first time the pub collectively winces when you narrowly miss your double and out is superbly atmospheric. And even though the chatter starts to repeat itself pretty quickly, the pressure of performing in front of a busy pub is surprisingly convincing, and it can be tough to hold your nerve on the final double.   In fact, the whole presentation of the game is pretty spot on, capturing the cheeky, cheery, cockney ethos of darts. The art style is bright and cartoony; character design is the sort of two-bob caricature that lines the walls of country pubs; and while the music gets annoying very quickly, it's a vaguely plausible sort of kerplunky piano noise that might emerge from a sing song within the sound of Bow Bells.    Early opponents are universally useless but it gets tough later in the game.  Apart from the tournaments, there are a variety of challenges to perform, a lot of which will be familiar to anyone who's enjoyed a few sessions of arrows in their own basement. Several feature playing cards pinned to the board (such as pairs, in which you have to hit matching cards, or 21 in which you have to turn over cards to score 21 without going bust). Others include Killer and Speed Darts.    Of course, Touch Darts isn't the first darts game on the DS. You might remember that a more than passably decent version was included as one of the 42 All-Time Classics. Touch Darts is much, much better though It's infinitely more precise, and, obviously, there's much more to do and unlock. But it does fall short in one pretty substantial area: multiplayer.    Forget about brain training  darts improves your maths too!  Now, Touch Darts is a game that excels in multiplayer. It's utterly open-ended, which means the multiplayer appeal is essentially infinite, assuming you and your friends live long enough. But unlike 42 All-Time Classics, there are no wi-fi modes. Which means you'll have to pass your DS round if you want to compete against your friends. It's not such a massive drawback, but given the apparent ease with which multiplayer darts was implemented in 42 All-Time Classics, it is a little bit disappointing. The only other disappointing thing about the game is the ease with which youll get through the majority of the single-player game, and the fact that the game doesnt include a sledging mode to really capture the ruthless psychological dimension of darts at the highest level. Apart from that it is, simply, the best ever videogame version of darts.", "date": "Jun 14, 2007"}
