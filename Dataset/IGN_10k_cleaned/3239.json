None of those that came afterwards could match the thrill, challenge, and maddening frustration of Dragon's Lair.  The story was simple: Dirk the Daring must rescue Princess Daphne from the clutches of evil dragon Singe.  Dirk, a bit of a klutz and a goof, must brave a gauntlet of traps and enemies to find and save Daphne.  Two things made this adventure unique and groundbreaking.  Everything was hand drawn (by Don Bluth), making it feel like you were in control of a Saturday morning cartoon, and your only control over Dirk's success or gruesome death was pressing the joystick in the right direction the moment an area onscreen flashed.  It wasn't free-roaming at all, in fact it was even more limiting than a game on rails, but it was unbelievably addictive.  Two decades later Dirk has landed on Xbox in a recreation of the originalDragon's Lair.  But as the new title, Dragon's Lair 3D suggests, Dirk is no longer confined to prescripted movements.  With full control given to players, Dirk enjoys the same hand-drawn appearance but allows for full platforming freedom.  Running about in a fully realized 3D castle with all of the famous original scenes remade with incredible accuracy, Dragon's Lair 3D is a fantastic remake that will please fans of the old game despite some of its nagging problems.  Features Take full control of Dirk the Daring in complete 3D environments! New hand-drawn animations by Don Bluth A variety of armor variations and power-ups 5.1 Dolby Digital 1080i support  Gameplay While Dragon's Lair 3D shares many common elements with its predecessor, it's important to note it's absolutely its own game.  Though you'll see plenty of familiar areas, villains, and puzzles, having complete control of Dirk and having fully-rendered 3D environments to explore offers a different type of gameplay experience.  Don't think you're getting some rehashed Lair game -- this is the real deal.  Dirk the Daring in 3D.  Control For a game that once simply relied on a person's joystick reflexes, Dragons' Lair 3D sure has a plethora of controls.  X attacks or uses an object, A jumps, Y targets an enemy, B blocks, Black draws your sword, White draws your crossbow, left trigger lets you run, right trigger crouches, and the two together make Dirk tuck and roll.  And I haven't even mentioned the left thumbstick which moves Dirk and the right which swings the camera (you'll be using this quite often), the back button bring up the amulet Princess Daphne speaks to you through, and clicking the right thumbstick puts you into a first-person view mode.  Phew.  Oh, and start brings up the pause menu.  That's every button on the Xbox and each one must be used regularly, which doesn't quite fit into what Dragon's Lair 3D is trying to be.  Essentially, Lair is an action game with heaps of platform elements throw in.  Controls should then be rather simple, a throwback perhaps, to what games were just a few years ago when four buttons got you through a game.  But instead of focusing on a simple, intuitive interface, Dragonstone has put too much emphasis on giving Dirk a dozen possible actions.  It's not bad, but it really doesn't seem to fit the game and will possibly frustrate younger players whom Dragon's Lair 3D will likely appeal to.    Jump Dirk, jump! Your primary actions in Dragons Lair 3D are jumping and attacking.  The evil wizard Mordroc's castle, made up of over 250 rooms, is filled with endless amounts of traps and beasties.  The traps come in various forms and create a castle that is your classic fantasy dungeon gone into overdrive.  Floors disappear, flames shoot from walls, bricks magically appear forming new walls to trap you, platforms rise and fall, bookcases move back and forth, chairs float through the air, books zip past you, explosive cannonballs crash at your feet, and pools of acid bubble and boil in anticipation of your first careless step.  As Dirk you'll do tons of jumping, swinging off ropes and chains, and riding moving platforms.  This is a classic platforming fans heaven.    To keep things varied, your platform skills will be put to a lot of different tests.  There are quite a few timed puzzles where you must do one thing, for example hit a bell, and then get to the other side of the room before time runs out and hit the other bell.  It's not always clear that's what you need to do though, and so sometimes Dragon's Lair 3D becomes a bit too much about trial and error just to learn your objective.  Good news is the platforming is varied enough that it doesn't get boring (though it can get frustrating).  Bad news is the camera is quite problematic, especially when you are on a moving platform, and must be constantly manipulated with the right thumbstick.  You will die quite a lot in Dragon's Lair 3D (don't worry, you have infinite lives) and quite a few of those instances will have nothing to do with your jumping or fighting skills -- the camera will be responsible for your undoing.  What's possibly worse is that many times you will jump for a chain or rope and swear you are in line to grab it, but somehow still miss it.  Still, as a platform and Dragon's Lair fan, I can live with the difficulty (and boy is it difficult) and some of the frustrations resulting from the camera, because this is about as intense a platform experience as you can get these days.  Obviously, anyone who's not into platform games can start edging away now.    Have sword, will travel Platforming is only half the Dragon's Lair puzzle, with the other half being fights with numerous enemies.  While there isn't the greatest variety of bad guys, there's enough to keep it from feeling like all you do is fight the same monsters each room.  Fights are pretty simple, with Dirk blocking, attacking, and running away.  You can lock on to enemies with the Y button, but there's only two types of attacks initially.  A standard swing (X) and an overhead swing (Y to jump followed by X).  You'll earn a few more power moves which use up mana but it's not much.  How hard would it have been to add a couple of very simple single button X-X-X combos to help fill out animations and give a better sense of a fluid fight?  As is, the fighting gets pretty redundant rather quickly.  Fortunately, you also gain a crossbow, which adds a bit more to the experience.  As stated just moments ago, you need mana to perform some of Dirk's special moves.  Both mana and health can be found as little blue and red orbs respectively.  Fallen enemies drop them and random barrels hold them as well, meaning you've got to smash everything you see in true action-platforming fashion.  Both mana and health come readily and even if you do happen to die, you'll always respawn close to where you departed.  This is a good thing, because you die a lot.  To mix things up even more, Dragonstone has included a few upgrades for Dirk that can be found throughout the game.  For example, Dragon's Wing gives Dirk the ability to float when he jumps and Dragon's Eye lets him see invisible objects.  There are six upgrades in all and Dragonstone made a good choice in adding them into the game.  But mommy, why's it got to be so hard? Personally, I like challenging games, and that's why I've so enjoyed Dragon's Lair 3D.  However, there's a difference between a challenging puzzle and one that's tough simply due to control and camera issues.  While Dragon's Lair 3D certainly has some well-designed and tough quests, some of them seem difficult simply because of the camera and touchy controls.  That holds Lair back a bit from being a true triumph, which is unfortunate, because after 20 years, Dragon's Lair is deserving of some new hype.  Despite its problems, it's amazing how accurate Dragon's Lair recreates some of the most well-remembered scenes of the 80's arcade era.  Anyone who played the original Dragon's Lair will recognize almost every room.  Remember those rolling balls in the half pipe?  The electrifying knight and his checkerboard arena?  The flying books in the library?  All are redone here as if developer Dragonstone crammed the Dragon's Lair arcade cabinet into some mystical 3D creation machine and out came the latest version of the Lair.      Graphics Dragon's Lair 3D looks so much like the original arcade version, it's kind of hard to believe.  Some cut-scenes from the arcade are reused and it's hard to tell the difference between new and old (though the new scenes clearly have better video quality).  Dirk looks as daring as ever, Daphne still has her pointy nipples, and Singe is the same fire-breathing dragon you remember from when you were seven.  Most of the Dragon's Lair visual standards are here too.  All of the cut-scenes were hand-drawn by Don Bluth and each area is a faithful recreation of the arcade original.  Dragon's Lair 3D can easily stand beside its beautiful arcade counterpart.  One thing curiously missing is the gruesome death scenes for Dirk.  While a dead Dirk will still drop in front of the screen, turn to skeleton bones, and crumble, the arcade version had much more gruesome detail.  You'd see Dirk being eaten alive or seared with acid.  None of that is here, which is unfortunate.  The lighting is good and a lot of attention has been paid to the little details.  But there are  spots where the framerate dips, which takes away from the cartoon fluidity.  Dragon's Lair 3D does offer 1080i support, so if your TV supports 1080i (still not that common) you're in for a cinematic treat.  Sound All of the classic sound effects and score from the original are back, including some new music and a few new sounds as well.  Done beautifully in 5.1, the classic score gives flashbacks to days gone by, and the additional music also sounds great.  But there are some oddities mixed in, like the monkey sounds the giddy goons make -- it seems out of place, despite the fact the goons are some odd mix of baboon.  Probably because it's a high-picked monkey squeal, not something you'd expect from a bigger, squatter baboon.  The sound effects are good and again the score is nice, but somehow the sound field doesn't seem as full as it should be. Dragon's Lair is one of those games from my childhood that has always stuck with me.  I remember getting the trading cards, watching the cartoon, and dropping endless amounts of quarters at the local arcade.  This is a stunning recreation of the original vision.  It's obvious great care was given to Dragon's Lair 3D and that care pays off.  The transition isn't the smoothest though as there are often times where your objective may be unclear and the fighting not as good as it could have been.  Some will balk at the in-game menu interface and the endless number of messages offered for your perusal.  Still, pushing through these issues (and the camera) is certainly worth it.  The holiday season has brought a slew of high-quality games to Xbox and perhaps the final score suggests Dragon's Lair inferior to these.  But you certainly can't go wrong here if you enjoyed the original or if you are looking for an incredibly challenging adventure-platformer.", "date": "Nov 20, 2002"}
