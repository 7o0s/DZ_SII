Take one look at the 3D platformer and you may recognize its roots. Ed, the game's janitorial hero and main character, hops happily along colorful 3D environments, completely oblivious to the fact that he has no connecting joints. His hands and feet seemingly hang by his side. He has no arms or legs. It's all very stylistic, of course, but it's hardly unique. Years ago Ubi Soft popularized the look in videogames with the release of the 2D Rayman for the Atari Jaguar (and then for PlayStation and Saturn). The similarities between Tonic Trouble and Rayman are not limited to graphics though. Both games also play very much alike. They both revolve around simple, tried-and-true platformer and exploration mechanics.So what?None of this would matter if Ubi Soft wasn't also rolling out a 3D N64 update to the Rayman franchise called Rayman 2: The Great Escape at virtually the same time. Whereas Tonic Trouble is an average platformer, Rayman 2 is an excellent one. Whereas Tonic Trouble features some good visuals, Rayman 2 boasts some breathtaking ones. And whereas Tonic Trouble delivers a decidedly slow, if not stale adventure, Rayman 2 is a delightful experience from beginning to end. The real question here is, do you want the S.S. Minnow or do you want the Love Boat?The Facts 3D platformer 12 different worlds to explore Jump, climb, fly, crawl and pogo Varied environments take games through ski-slopes, mountains, lava canyons, pyramids and more Controller Pak support Single-player onlyGameplayThe name Tonic Trouble comes from the game's off-the-wall storyline. One day while travelling through space, Ed clumsily spills the tonic he is drinking onto Earth below and trouble begins. The drink has a unique effect on the planet, transforming its lands and inhabitants into strange, psychedelic mutations. Water turns to a rainbow colored punch, tomatoes grow teeth and begin hopping around, toasters go insane and a Viking named Grogh proclaims himself master of the Earth. Ed, realizing what his accident has caused, decides to take action. The adventure begins with the main character making his way to the planet below.The control setup can be described as standard. Ed is manipulated with the analog joystick, while the A button works to jump and the B button makes the character use his stick weapon. A combination of buttons also activate specific extras. For example, Ed can go into blowpipe mode by pressing R button, in which case pressing B serves to shoot bees. Players can fly in specific areas by pressing the A button twice while in the air. Ed can also swim, pogo, change into different characters and become Super Ed, a barbaric version of his former self that can bend bars, kick and slap enemies.In theory all of this should work, but in the final product none of it clicks together as planned. Admittedly, Ed does not control particularly poorly and there is quite a bit to do. Levels are split up all over the place and filled with unique tasks that need to be accomplished -- some easier than others. Much of the action revolves around strategically tricking enemies into killing themselves or, helping Ed gain access to a new area. One level, for example, sees the character on a lava bed with three platforms. On each platform is a target and on the opposite side of the room there is, of course, a flying corncob. The idea is to trick the enemy into firing upon the target, which then sends its fire ricocheting back at it. After several direct hits, the enemy falls into the lava and explodes into a horrible sprite popcorn animation. This is relatively standard platform stuff, though, and the game never really takes that extra step to introduce anything new.There are some control issues. Ed's feet feel as if they are glued to the ground. When he moves, it looks as though he is being dragged along against his will. Perhaps he is. Partly because of this small, seemingly unimportant detail, the game never feels quite right. Without a doubt, though, Tonic Trouble's biggest problem is its generic feel. We look at it, we play around with it and we feel as if we've seen and done it all before. There's no motivation to keep playing at all. How can we be made to search out items, face-off with enemies and overcome puzzles if they don't offer us anything new and, quite frankly, we just don't care to keep playing?GraphicsVisually, Tonic Trouble wants to be Rayman 2, which makes perfect sense considering that both games were designed by the same person. Unfortunately, though, Tonic simply can't compare with Rayman in terms of visual brilliance. This is not to say that it's an ugly game. Character models and levels are well designed and framerate is never an issue. Texture quality, though, is nowhere close to that of Rayman 2. It's also a bit slower, doesn't run in high-resolution mode and doesn't feature the quality of animation that Rayman does. The graphics have an odd, dithered effect about them in some areas of the game. And how many times will we have to watch Ed be sucked through a portal piece by piece before it's enough?Left: The Love Boat ----- Right: The S.S. MinnowWhile we like the style of the game, there is no doubt that it will ultimately be remembered, at least visually, as the platformer that aspired to be Rayman 2 and failed.SoundSound effects are not Tonic Trouble's strong point and that's because there are far too few of them. Ed hobbles along well enough, but there is no indication sound-wise that he is walking on velcro or that glue is holding back his step. How are we to know this then? The game features traditional platformer beeps, bops, grunts, splashes, thuds and whacks, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary or exceptional.Music is a different story. The tunes in the game are very enjoyable -- some entirely unique and some obviously inspired by other songs. A very well done acoustic guitar strum is used quite a bit and works well to add a bit of life to this sometimes yawn-inducing title. Another song sounds as if it is taken directly out of the original Super Mario Bros. and then played backward. Listen for it. All in all, the music selection in the game is one of Tonic Trouble's strong points.I can remember back more than three years ago when Tonic Trouble was still called Ed. It was one of Nintendo 64's first promised titles, and at the time I had hopes that it might actually one-up Super Mario 64. Three years later the wait, in my opinion, has not been worth it. Tonic Trouble is a generic, lifeless platformer and in spite of sharing much of the same features that somehow work wonderfully for Rayman 2, nothing seems to click together as it should for this title. While nothing, including control, design or graphics, can be described as poor, none of it is exceptionally good either. We are left with a game that is neither particularly good nor bad. Had Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, Donkey Kong 64 and Ubi Soft's own Rayman 2 not existed, Tonic Trouble might have impressed Nintendo 64 owners. Unfortunately though, they do and it doesn't.", "date": "Oct 14, 1999"}
