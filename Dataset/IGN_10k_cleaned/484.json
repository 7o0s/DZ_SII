{"name": "Boombots", "name_review": "Boombots", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/04/boombots", "text": "Apparently, the abysmal fighter Clay Fighter somehow made an impression on somebody in the game industry. Boombots is a silly fighter from the shattered minds at The Neverhood (the creators behind Earthworm Jim, Skullmonkeys, and the PC game The Neverhood) that just doesn't add up to much. It has a pool of hammy characters that fight in ridiculous battles in intergalactic cat boxes and post-apocalyptic hockey rinks. But there's not enough gameplay ingenuity or furor to make this brazenly juvenile game worth more than a play through or two. Neverhood certainly hasn't taken the Trophy of Trash off of the Clay Fighter mantle, but no matter how funny the sequences in Boombots are the first time through, they still don't save this game from being a flat, cheap fighter.  Gameplay  The problem with weak fighters is that you spend an awful lot of time playing them, trying to dig deeper into the control and gameplay in the desperate hope of finding some good fighting play somewhere down in there, something you missed because you were playing the game as if it were a great fighter. When it comes to Boombots, enjoy the game for its merits, but don't waste your time looking for great fighting action. It's just not there.  You control one of 10 Boombots (~bots~ that are specifically designed to... boom, I guess. They don't seem to have any other logical purpose for their existence). These fighting, farting things are supposed to save the galaxy from evil cats in the year 15 million. The fighting comes out in punches and kicks, missiles and rockets, and special grab combo attacks. The farting comes from the same general place that the fighting came from.   Yes, the fighting is that lame. It's not enough to make Boombots the worst game ever made, but bad in another way -- the gameplay is bland, slow, and unremarkable, and never really has anything going for it. When you're far away from somebody, launch homing missiles. When you're close to them, run away and launch some more homing missiles. Each character has some hand-to-hand moves (which are almost useless except to deflect homing missiles) and a gun (which is woefully under-powered compared to the more handy homing missiles). You can also grab the enemy and do a big Grapple special move (which mostly involves holding the enemy up and hitting them in the face with a silly punch). Players also can try to get powered up to Mongo mode (where the character is bigger but has less control, as the only thing you can do in Mongo mode is, of course, shoot super homing missiles).  And that's kind of it. You unlock five hidden Boombots, (one is a Neverhood resident that you'll recognize if you played Skullmonkeys, which you probably didn't) but they're all just silly characters that do all the same things as the other Boombots. Missiles take energy out of the Mongo meter, but there's plenty of energy scattered in the arena to make that a moot point. There are some power-ups (shields, bombs, multipliers) that have the potential to change up the game's dynamics, but they aren't varied enough to really make the game interesting, and their overall effect on the gameplay is nil. You run around in the arenas trying to avoid homing missile attacks and get near enough to your opponent to grab them and deliver a Grapple move. There are combos in the Grapple, but it's kind of unfair because once a grab has started, you have all the control of the game until your combo is done (like an MK juggle combo). Yes, that's the purpose of a combo, I know, but here the whole game just halts and spotlights you while the Boombot do your combo, so two-player rounds have a lot of down time for sandwich making. It's a real leisurely pace for a game that's supposed to be outrageous and exciting.  The arenas are somewhat involving, which is good. Many are multi-tiered, making the homing missiles a little less devastating. You'll be able to jump up on pyramids, or hide out on a ledge and rain down on your opponent. Some levels have a lot of places to hide, while others are open and force you to run for your life when a homing missile is in chase. None are so tight that they force the use of hand-to-hand fighting, but they do play a part in the gameplay. There are also destructible elements that hide power-ups.   Graphics  This is what the Neverhood does best, but the move to 3D has taken some wind out of its sails. The textures were specifically designed to retain the clay model look that the Neverhood prides itself in. Characters are, for the most part, interesting and silly, but few are so fall-down funny that  you'll hope to see them make a return trip in another Neverhood game. The airplane character and the evil dancing cat are  particularly interesting (but, of course, they still fight like everybody else).   Environments also are colorful and well-rendered, with the same clay model look in the design. The movies (all done with actual claymation) are very nice, and many of them are hysterical in their nonsense, but the Neverhood blew its wad making just a few claymation sequences -- stop-motion animation takes so long to animate and shoot that the Neverhood only had enough time to make one series of movies, rather than tailoring individual sequences for each character. With only a handful of these movies to watch, there's not much reason to play through the game with each character.  The issue with the in-game graphics is that they're blurry and lack detail. Characters only look good in the Grapple combo sequences, and even then, the movement lacks animation. They may look like clay, but actual claymation has a certain look to it, a certain attention to detail in the fingers and eyes and body language, and that hasn't been captured at all in the 3D polygon animation. Levels look low-res, so even when you're playing in the Cat Box arena, the poop doesn't look very poopie. The rockets, power-ups, and special effects all look boring and washed out. Even the Mongo mode effect, which sends out a big blast of something (who knows what) that warps the background as it fires, isn't too special.  Sound Poots and toots. The game has all kinds of cartoon sound effects and big bomb sounds, but there is little that stands out. Boombot voices aren't spectacular either -- they say ~Hi~ and ~Hey~, occasionally ~Come here!~ or ~All right!~ but still nothing too clever. Some characters do have fun intros (like the evil dancing cat), but the actual battles are just grunts and shouts.   The music is made up of bad techno beats that are metallic (I guess fitting in the nature of the Boombots), but, again, aren't that fascinating, and don't make any impression. Only the fart noises, which are in abundance in the FMV and, to a lesser extent, the gameplay, are really funny. That's what the Neverhood loves best, and that's where they spent a great deal of their time in making Boombots (an end sequence even shows them reveling in their flatulence work). It's funny, (and, for some, it never gets old) but it's still nothing extraordinary.In our preview of Boombots, Doug TenNapel said that he's got an issue with the state of gaming, that something is wrong with the direction games are going in. But look around you: Right now we've got the most mature, complicated, and sophisticated action games ever made (Metal Gear Solid, Medal of Honor, Syphon Filter), the most whimsical, imaginative, and pleasurable fantasy games (Zelda, Spyro, Mario 64), the grandest stories (Final Fantasy VIII, Grandia, Lunar), the most technical and visceral fighting games (Soul Caliber, Virtua Fighter 3 TB, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Power Stone, The Bouncer), and some of the most exciting and inventive experimentations in both physics and gameplay since the '80s (Tony Hawk, Thrasher, Sled Storm, Um Jammer Lammy, Thousand Arms, Pong, N64's Rocket: Robot on Wheels). Sorry, Doug, but I think you're wrong. Gaming is the best it's ever been, and a game that doesn't try to push gaming further or in some new direction doesn't cut it.I can't come down too hard on Boombots, because it doesn't aspire to much more than being a funny game. And it is mildly amusing. But it's a lackluster fighter, and it won't hold your imagination for long once you've played it through. If you want claymation, try James and the Giant Peach, or something by the Aardman studios or Jan Svankmajer. If you want humor, get Stripes or Austin Powers. If you want Mongo power, pick up Blazing Saddles. This game has some elements of all of those things, but it still doesn't add up to much to deal with the boring gameplay.", "date": "Dec 4, 1999"}
