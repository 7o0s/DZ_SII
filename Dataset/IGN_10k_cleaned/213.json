The first time I played Expendable I didn't like it. The opening CG movie was funny enough, what with its ~Alien meets Matrix~ introduction that follows your soldier as he is systematically hatched, grown, and recruited to fight for his race. It's quite amusing really, but once the game itself starts and I was left on the scarred battlefield to destroy everything in sight, I wasn't that impressed. The control scheme made it difficult for me to do anything and the cramped upper-screen made me wonder what the hell was going on up there. ~It's a waste of time,~ I thought... But believe it or not, I changed my mind.   Now don't look for any surprising plot twists or extensive character development in Expendable. You won't find any of that here. No, much like mayhem shooters of the past like Smash T.V., Total Carnage, and Loaded, Rage Software's newest shooter gives you but a single goal; Kill everything in sight, and do it in record time.    The game plays simply enough, with one button each for firing your gun, your grenades, and switching between different weapons. You can move a full 360 degrees (well, supposedly) and strafe until your heart's content. You can even choose between the digital or analog pad to steer your hero (personally, I recommend a combination of both. Use the analog for mindless shooting and the digital for more precise shots). Once you have become accustomed to the layout, all you have to do now is follow blinking arrows and shoot things. Unfortunately, accomplishing that is not without its problems.   That's right kids, there's a MAJOR problem with moving your rifleman from point A to point B. For a reason I do not know, every other angle seems to be cut from your circular movement. To clarify, it means that when you are in the middle of a turn or trying to pinpoint some of the peskier targets, your character just can't go there. I liken it to a sort of animation skip, whereas certain angles just can't be moved to because of a missing frame. I know this is supposed to be a 2D problem, but because stopping is so mushy due to your inertia, it seems to have the ~skip~ effect I just described.   Another problem arises when you look at the top half of the screen and see just how cluttered it is. Between flashing credits signs, energy bars, card key icons, and various other doodads that do lord-knows-what, you can barely see what's coming at you from the North side of your view. Despite these two major flaws however, I still find Expendable pretty satisfying.   Why? Well, the first thing you'll notice is just how detailed and visually powerful the game is. Between the stunning textures that litter every object of the landscape to the mind-blowing lighting effects popping in and out of your television set, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better looking title that shares the genre. Each approaching monster and alien looks adequately gruesome, and their animation is at a true-to-life level rarely seen in games of this type.   While the music is practically non-existent in the early going and under-scored later on, the sound effects provide quite a thunderous boom to the speakers. Explosions, gunfire, and the crashes of falling objects help immerse you in your Alien identity. It surely could have used more tunes though, as I find that the somewhat-ambient approach in shooting games isn't as audibly powerful as those with an ass-kicking fully loaded score.   The best part of Expendable for me, though, has to be all the action. Everywhere you turn, whether you're playing on easy or expert mode, there is always something coming to get you. Aerial crafts whiz by in the background and crash into monuments and buildings, and the ground itself shakes and breaks apart, forcing you to go into an all new direction. Acid-bleeding creepers, Predator-like hunters, and giant mechanoid killers aim at you with a vengeance, and while the average gamer may make it all the way to the end of Expendable after the first try or two on the easy setting, once you tackle the harder modes get ready for a challenge like you won't believe. Even with the option of having a second player joined along side you, you'll be in a bind to make it past the first few stages, let alone all of them.While there was a lot developer Rage could have done to spruce up the experience, such as add a few more stages, throw in a couple additional cutscenes, and elaborate on the musical aspect a bit, Expendable is still a pretty good time-waster. Although the control issues may leave a lot of people frustrated and bothered, if you sit back and stick with it, you may have quite the enjoyable journey ahead. Good luck soldier!", "date": "Sep 9, 1999"}
