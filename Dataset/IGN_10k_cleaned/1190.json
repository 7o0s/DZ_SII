While it once again allows players to take control of remote controlled cars, the game engine and direction have gone under a major overhaul and the game has ended up being an entirely unique gaming experience.   Fans of the PC and Dreamcast versions (nobody could possibly be a fan of the PS version of Re-Volt) might find this to be problematic, but seeing as how poorly the original PlayStation version of the game turned out, it looks like it was a pretty smart move by Acclaim to shift the general direction of this game.   Gameplay One of the biggest complaints about the original Re-Volt on PlayStation was that the game's controls were a bit clunky and much too unforgiving. While the true-to-life RC simulation seemed to work on the PC and Dreamcast, it failed on PlayStation because the control proved to be less than precise thanks to the game's atrocious framerate and game speed.   This problem has been remedied with RC Revenge, as the developers have tightened up the game's control greatly and have made things a lot more merciful. While there are many instances where players will find themselves turned upside down or stuck in weird corners, the collision detection is much more forgiving, so nicking your front-end on a corner won't always get you trapped.   The races themselves aren't quite as forgiving and this is actually one of the game's chief selling points. While some may get annoyed to the point of frustration with challenge offered by the computer controlled competitors, the fact that the computer almost cheats to win races makes for some very exciting races. It's not rare to go from first to last with the blink of an eye and vice versa -- this makes winning a race so much more rewarding and enjoyable.   What makes this even better is that the game's cheating AI isn't a simple case of try to stay in last place as long as possible so you get all the good power-ups and win in the end like in Mario Kart. The best technique is actually to get out in front as quickly as possible and create as much distance from the pack as you possibly can. You won't get the good power-ups and the people in the rear will, but you're rewarded greatly by the fact that you're not getting smacked around in the general pack and constantly knocked off course.   In terms of overall play value, RC Revenge gives the player a lot of bang for the buck. For the player going solo, the Championship mode offers plenty of challenge and allows him or her to open up a multitude of new vehicles and courses by being victorious in the different tournaments. There are ten standard cars, plus five bonus vehicles, over five different courses, and plenty of very cool weapons. All of this help add up to one of the most addictive racing games that you'll find on PlayStation -- once you start getting into several competitive races in RC Revenge, you'll be hard pressed to put the controller down until you've won a few tournaments.   Additionally, players not satisfied with the single player challenge and go head-to-head against a friend in the game's two-player split screen racing mode. Not nearly as smooth or polished as the single player game, the split screen racing suffers a bit from the lower framerate and other graphical problems such as pop-up. It's still fun to be able to challenge friends, but the races generally feel like they're more about luck than pure racing skills. Four-player split screen would've been especially cool to try out, but seeing that the game's visuals took a serous hit with just the two-player split screen, then four-player was probably completely out of the question.   Graphics The game's developers at Acclaim Studios Cheltenham managed to do something that the programmers of the original PlayStation Re-Volt failed at miserably -- get the game running at a decent framerate. Not only does RC Revenge move rather smoothly with little to no slowdown to speak of, it gives players a tremendous sensation of speed. Both of which are fundamental aspects of what helps make a good racing game.   Beyond the framerate, the game's visuals are pretty much average fare for PlayStation. The 3D track environments are textured reasonably well and the car and boat models are pretty basic for the most part. There's nothing really out of this world, but at the same time, there's not really any major problems. The game features a minimal amount of pop-up and things like clipping and texture warping are fairly non-existent.   Sound Some of the sound effects are decent enough -- there are realistic sounding engine noises (they sound like remote controlled vehicles) and the background effects are more than adequate. Alternatively, the game's background music is downright disgusting. The happy-go-lucky tunes might fit the game's intended mood, but they do nothing but become annoying and painful to listen to. When you're playing this one, you might just be better off turning off the music and plopping the latest N'Sync CD into your music player.  I loved the PC and Dreamcast versions of Re-Volt. Both versions had superb visuals, realistic ~RC~ physics, and proved to be very challenging while remaining quite enjoyable. The same positive remarks could not be said about the PlayStation version of the game, which was such an utter disappointment thanks to its horrid framerate and unforgiving control. Seeing that, it baffled me when I first discovered that Acclaim was working on a sequel to the game, but only releasing it for PlayStation -- the system with the lone bad version of the previous game. Well, it turns out that Acclaim might have made a good decision with this particular title. Knowing that Re-Volt probably left a bad taste in the mouths of any PlayStation owner that played it, the company not only decided to take the Re-Volt name out of the title, but make some other substantial changes to it. The game's new developers decided to ditch the ultra-realistic, RC-esque controls for a simpler, arcade style. While this negates some of the game's appeal -- the feeling that you're really controlling a remote-controlled vehicle -- the fact that it lessens the load on the CPU has enabled the developers to get the game moving at a solid framerate. The game moves surprisingly fast and despite the fact that it doesn't have some same realistic RC-feel, it has retained the addictive quality of the original. RC Revenge might not be as good of a game as the PC or Dreamcast versions of Re-Volt, but it's easily superior to the PlayStation Re-Volt and is clearly a very exciting racing game on its own. It's a whole lot of fun to play and it's one of those games that'll annoy the hell out of you, yet keep you glued to your television screen and PlayStation controller.", "date": "Aug 24, 2000"}
