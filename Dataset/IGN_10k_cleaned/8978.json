There's no way a kid will learn to shoot a gun by tapping a button, but little Johnny can definitely build an early addiction to gambling by learning to play blackjack or poker and blowing all his fake money on stupid bets. There's hope for those few parents that may be worried that their kid will end up spending his life savings at the roulette wheel. Magnin & Associates (a development studio, not a law firm) has recently made Vegas Casino and after playing this, not only will the player never want to gamble, they may also develop a phobia of casinos in general.   Vegas Casino as a game doesn't need explaining. It's a casino in Las Vegas. What's the casino's name? Uh it apparently doesn't have one. Maybe Vegas Casino is the name of the casino, which implies it's actually on a Native American reservation.   Before players start they have to select their character. Why? It's hard to say because the character is never visible. Maybe the developers thought it'd be more fun if players assumed the role of one of their polygonal monstrosities instead of pretending to be themselves. Or perhaps there was a plan for a multiplayer mode that just never happened.   When players first enter the ~Vegas~ Casino they may notice a large selection of tables and slots to choose from. Actually there are five games: slot machines, roulette, blackjack, Texas hold 'em and the Big-6 money wheel. It's all pretty standard casino affair. Most of the games have multiple versions with higher stakes different tables. To make the game look like an actual casino each table is replicated dozens of times. Rows and rows of the same slot machine crowd both sides of the establishment, while dozens of blackjack tables cram in the middle. It seems unnecessary to have the same game replicated so many times, especially considering this: The map is so large that it doesn't fit on the touch screen, forcing players to slowly scroll through the casino just to find the table they want. Getting from the Big-6 money wheel to Texas hold 'em is a chore, and then trying to get back to the cashier window takes far too long. It breaks up the game. Maybe the developers were going for that authentic feel, and wanted to simulate the hassle of trying to maneuver through a real Vegas casino. Would it have been worth it to make the generic Vegas Casino seem a little smaller so that everything was readily available on the touch screen? Of course it would have been.   All the excitement of that trashy Reno casino my grandmother frequents. However, a good selection of games is what really makes a casino title shine. With so many casino games out there, though, Vegas Casino needed something to stand out. The developers did something brave. They implemented voice control into all of their games. It's a great idea, but it hits a major roadblock. It doesn't really work. The premise is simple enough, a few basic commands for the different options. Bet, raise, call, fold. But far more frustrating than Brain Age trying to recognize the word blue, is trying to get Vegas Casino to understand things like ~double down.~ The manual suggests wearing headphones, but even using the handy Nintendo headset with the mic the voice control was still terrible. In the roulette table the thing really comes apart. The voice recognition can't handle numbers, so there are no voice commands to bet on, say, 22 black. It gets even worse when there are similar sounding commands. Trying to get up from the table by saying ~leave~ and having the computer bet $50 on ~even~ is not cool. The times that it does work there is a noticeable delay so the game slows to a crawl and becomes tedious.   Fortunately Mr. Magnin and his associates had the foresight to include two other control schemes. Unfortunately it doesn't seem that either of these is very well thought out. Vegas Casino has basic touch screen and button controls. Now the obvious choice would have been to have all the available actions displayed on the touch screen. Maybe something like ~A - Hit~ and ~B - Stand.~ That way players could tap that on screen button, and they'd also know which button to push on their DS. Instead players have to hit the L button to show what commands are available, and which buttons or stylus maneuvers work them. Unnecessary swipes are used to bet or call, and it all gets confusing when moving from game to game. It gets so annoying that after only a couple hands most people will be ready to leave. No, leave. Not even! ARGH!   For added ambience and realism, players will sometimes be accompanied by AI players. This means that players will have to wait for two or three fake schmucks to slowly play their hand of blackjack before players are allowed to continue. The AI players are the same terrible looking models from the character select screen. It's like gambling with mannequins from a department store. The animations for everyone, including the dealer are slow and unconvincing. It looks similar to how the people in the original The Sims acted, except they moved like that because they had a ton of objects to interact with and so liberties had to be taken. The dealer only has a few moves, so it doesn't seem like she should just paw at cards and have them magically appear places.   By this point it's questionable whether the people at Magnin & Associates have even been to Vegas, let alone played any of the games they portrayed. While slot machines may not be the most exciting game in the casino, there is at least some thrill of watching the wheels spin around, deciding your economic fate. Here there is none of that thrill and the slot machines become about as thrilling as those LCD casino games old women play. Roulette however is a pretty exciting game, and Vegas Casino has managed to suck all the fun right out of it, too. Most of the games don't show how much money players have left or are betting. Players have to press a different button to bring up their money and find out that they accidentally bet $150. The Texas Hold 'Em is a joke. After dealing out the cards, players don't even get to look at them until it's their turn to bet. After they bet the cards disappear again and don't come back up until all the AI characters have made a move. The game moves so slow it makes the TV poker games look like an extreme sport. Oh and get this, there is no option to go all in. Players can only raise in small increments.Vegas Casino is the perfect example of what happens when a development team puts everything they have into a gimmick, instead of making a well rounded game. Even if said gimmick, the voice controls, worked, Vegas Casino would still be terrible. Since they don't work, it makes the game downright horrendous. The graphics are gross and wonky, the controls are barely functional, and the games themselves are mere shells of what they're supposed to be. It's a good thing a real casino didn't get their name attached to this mess, though the city of Vegas as a whole may be insulted by the thing. Magnin and Associates bet everything they had, and busted.", "date": "Sep 4, 2007"}
