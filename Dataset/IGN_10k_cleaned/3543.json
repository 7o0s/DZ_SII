{"name": "Vietcong", "name_review": "Vietcong", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/31/vietcong", "text": "Vietcong follows a US Special Forces group out of Nui Pek, a base just a few miles outside of the Cambodian border where a group of Special Forces were camped for incursions into enemy territory to deal with the North Vietnamese Army and the feared Viet Cong, a guerrilla force with an uncanny knack for killing the hell out of their enemies. You play the part of Sergeant First Class Steve Hawkins that has just been assigned to the unit at Nui Pek. As you might imagine, the group is filled with all different personalities, that don't always mix well, but they always get the job done. It's good to be the best. Aside from some small conversation and jibes back and forth, there's not much character development to be had, but that's probably because there's not much story to be had. The story is really just Hawkins and his missions.   The missions begin with a briefing cutscene that takes place in the Nui Pek camp. You and your team will be given mission parameters before marching off into the forest, or wherever else the game takes you. You get your orders from a Fire Marshall Bill looking character with no upper lip and a lop-sided nose that allows him to consume huge quantities of cocaine through one of his nostrils. The voice work here is done decently, although it sounds like the actors were trying a little too hard at times, especially the main character and machine gunner.   Once you're done with the short briefing, you'll have the opportunity to pick out what weapon you would prefer to use and grab ammo for it. You'll start out with slim pickings and work your way up to better weapons as you move through the game. These weapons also become available in the quick fight as you progress, giving you some of that ~unlocking~ fun we usually miss out on compared to console titles. These weapons can all be tested on the firing range as well, in case you're not sure what kind of effects they have. During this time, you can also extend your fictional enjoyment by reading Hawkins' journal about the missions and team bios as well as your historical enjoyment through some slim readings about the area, the VC and some of the tactics used in Vietnam. While I appreciated the effort, I really didn't give a crap. They weren't exactly exciting reads, although some of the field guide helped out a little bit in game.   Once you're done fiddling around in the bunker, it's time to head out into one of the varied missions. When I say varied I mean it in a couple of ways. First, the mission structures themselves are pretty different. There's everything from search and destroy missions to base defense missions, to recon missions. There's a lot to be had here. Unfortunately, it also varies in terms of quality. There are some exciting points in this game where you'll start to smile, and then you'll be hit with frustration and boredom all of the sudden.      For example, who the hell thought it would be a good idea to stick a gamer in miles of bland underground tunnels. It took me an hour and a freakin' half to get out of the stupid things. Upon reaching the surface Hawkins says, ~Thank Christ!~ and I echoed his sentiments. Sure, the tunnels were great for a small portion, I know it was part of the war, but good lord... let me out of the damn things already, I'm getting claustrophobic. Sadly, you'll actually find yourself walking for good distances without seeing enemies more than a little bit in this game, even when you aren't in a tunnel. I suppose that was to create suspense, but there's timing involved in that, and they missed the mark on a few occasions.   But for all of that, there are some really fun portions of this game, mostly thanks to your squad members. I've always thought it was fun to work with other people on your team, like in Medal of Honor. Having some folks to play with you, even if that is AI is pretty fun. Seeing them spread out and dive for cover while shouting obscenities at the VC is fairly entertaining, although I swear I heard Bender from Futurama and Bill from King of the Hill in there. Anyway, they're mainly autonomous, which is nice, although occasionally they'll do something stupid, like jump in front of you while you're firing... which leads to mission failure. Most of the time they won't die on their own, thankfully, because when they do, it's usually compltetely out of your control, which can be a pain in the ass. There's nothing like playing a mission to perfection on your side only to have jack ass machine gunner get shot around the other side of the base.   But as I said, their AI mostly works very well. When an enemy is spotted, they all run for cover and start firing. You have some bit of control over the troops as well, which works most of the time, although every now and again, when you tell them to hold position so you can scout ahead a bit, they'll forget you told them to stay put once bullets go whizzing around. This can be a pain in the butt when you're trying to call in artillery fire to take out heavily fortified locations. One step too far and they're toast. The interface for giving commands is very simple since the commands you can give are simple as well. You can call any of your troops to you immediately in case you need ammo, medical attention, or use of the radio.    The most problems I had with the AI was actually in the pathfinding. You'll often find them in your way, or running into the side of a ditch trying vainly to jump their way out of it. Your pathfinder is also a bit roundabout in pathfinding some times. He'll go the wrong way and finally turn around to lead you in the right direction. But he's still useful as a scout since he'll always find the enemy and warn you before you're staring a fistful of VC pointing their guns at you.    Enemy AI is likewise good at dodging and staying in cover. In fact, firefights can be intense when everyone gets in the action and flanking maneuvers are part of the fun. Of course, the enemies have a knack for knowing where you are (though not as bad as Sniper Town in MoH), so you'll have to react quickly when you round that tree and see a bad guy. It's strange though, the enemies aim normally in the single player game, often missing, but if you get in a cooperative multiplayer game, you're going to get torn up by sharpshooter AI that blows your head off as soon as you peek up and aim.   The combination of the enemy and friendly AI certainly makes the game's atmosphere fun and exciting. Walking through a dense forest to sudden attack and see the battle unfold before you with gunfire cracking in the distance, shouts of VC and US troops back and forth, bullets whizzing in the air, thunking into tree's next to you and crackling through leaves and branches can be pretty intense. Seeing your well animated friends and enemies climbing over branches, diving for cover, and crouching for a good shot is great.   If only these good things had been the mainstay throughout the game. Instead of having a fun game with plenty of action and a steadily chaotic environment like a Vietnam game should have, you're stuck with a flurry of bugs, a horrific frame rate at times, and some terrible collision detection, both from weapons fire and environment. There were more than a few points where I had accidentally gotten myself stuck in the environment, such as a POW cage door as I was trying to rescue him and make my escape. The thing opened up towards me, went right into me, and all the sudden I couldn't move. Embarrassingly, that occurred a couple of times before I learned my lesson. And this was in a mission, where the computer was telling me that I had rescued the POW when I hadn't even made it to the camp yet. Add onto that, the explosion which was supposed to draw the guards away from the POW cage only woke more up in the camp to run around looking for me in the bushes. What the hell use was that?     Aside from that, you'll get stuck in odd places, such as Steve getting stuck in a bed during multiplayer, or me accidentally sitting on someone's lap in the helicopter so that it didn't think everybody was in so the mission could end and it wouldn't let me out of the copter to try again, meaning I had to play through the last part of the mission again. Add on top of that, bullet collision that just doesn't seem to work sometimes. Try shooting at a guy 8 times from ten feet away and having an enemy not die or even flinch. I may not be the best gamer in the world, but I know when I should be hitting bodies.   And the worst game killer of all is the frame rate. If you have a Athlon 1.4Ghz with 512MB RAM and a GeForce3, expect a lot of chop at 800x600 with medium character and environment detail. If you have a P4 2.0Ghz with 768MB RAM and a Radeon 9700 Pro, expect some chop as well. It's too bad, because the game actually looks fairly decent at a high resolution, but likely you won't be playing at that so you'll get even more pixely in the forests. Especially in multiplayer, which is downright atrocious with the frame rate. It was virtually unplayable at points, which was of course compounded by the insanely accurate AI causing Ivan intermittent fits of rage and depression. He's now suing IGN for worker's compensation. Who knows though, maybe we'll get hazard pay for playing games now...   Multiplayer in general is a bit sad. While there are a few modes to play, including cooperative mode, which is usually a favorite around the office, it bogs down with boring maps and that bad framerate. I can honestly say that no one was having fun playing this and were all a little miffed at me for making them. I suppose that's why while I'm still wearing my underwear, it's now on my head.   Some good ideas and strong AI doesn't make a game great. In fact, it apparently makes for a pretty average game if you don't bother to bug test or optimize code enough. There's just no standing for that kind of development when you're charging 40-50 bucks for a game.If you were eagerly awaiting a Vietnam based shooter and can't wait for anything in the future, then I'd say you could get away with buying Vietcong. There are some good levels in here and the environment is conducive to chaos and scary battles. But unless you have a supercomputer, you're going to have performance problems that can make the game almost unplayable at times. It's frustrating as is with guys shooting from bushes so you can't see anything except for the muzzle fire. Vietnam was hell, and it's translated well in that way, but unfortunately it just doesn't pass muster leaving us with an average game that could have been great.", "date": "Mar 31, 2003"}
