Whenever I played another baseball series, I compared it to my love for WSB.  Some came close, but none could stack up to Sega's masterpiece.  Having spent the past few weeks playing World Series Baseball for Xbox, I can finally unplug my Saturn and pack up my old WSB.  World Series Baseball Xbox is now my favorite baseball game of all time.  Features  Every major league player, team, and stadium Amazingly deep franchise mode with coaches and scouts who offer advice Uneven trades, minor league rosters, and a rookie draft Incredible graphics and player-specific crowd taunts Hall of Fame team featuring 25 of the greatest players of all time Old school uniforms so you can play like it's 1969 Only on Xbox  Gameplay Here's what many gamers have come to expect from a baseball title: you hit too many homers, the computer makes some utterly ridiculous base running moves, and after forty or so games it's just not fun anymore.  Such is not the case with World Series Baseball.  Blue Shift has managed to make a baseball game that is not dominated by the long ball.  The contests in WSB are often close games with realistic scores and stats.  Games don't drag, not even games reaching into the extra innings, and you won't have many (if any) games where you score twenty runs and collect forty hits.  Let's lay it out right now -- World Series Baseball is the best baseball game of 2002 on any system.  If you love baseball, go buy the game right now and then come back and read the rest of this review.    Controls WSB Xbox shares similar controls to WSB 2K1 for Dreamcast.  The face pad is used to throw to the various bases, with the left trigger switching fielders and the right trigger causing a fielder to dive for a ball.  The transition from batter to fielder is well-timed.  The camera never stays focused on the batter for too long, so you won't have a problem fielding a ball in the infield because of a wonky camera.  With quick reactions, you'll find yourself snaring liners and getting to grounders that would seem out of reach.  Pressing a face button before you have the ball will cause the fielder to perform a harder, smoother, and more immediate throw after fielding the ball.    The batting interface is about as simple as can be.  You have a batting cursor which changes size slightly depending on a hitter's ability.  There is no ~power swing~ button.  You can bunt with Y or you doa normal swing with A.  Home runs are based on where the ball hits the bat, when, and how good a home run hitter the batter is.    There are nine different types of pitches available in the game, each assigned to a different D-Pad direction (no D-Pad selects fastball).  Each pitcher has two to five pitches they can throw with varying degrees of speed and accuracy.  Leaving the strike zone and pitching cursor on (changed in the options menu), you can try and best aim your pitches.  However, if you are a real man/woman/whatever you'll want to turn those off and pitch by feel.  This way you can suggest where you'd like to throw the ball, but as with real baseball, you'll never know how exact a pitch is gonna be.  This makes hitting the corners much more challenging and makes it a bit easier to throw a curveball down the heart of the plate.  AI The AI in WSB is solid but far from perfection.  You won't see many stupid AI errors, but there are some notable ones.  The biggest problem is AI baserunning.  Far too often a runner on second or third will not try to advance on a ball hit to right field.  Whether it's a ground ball or a line drive hit to right field, sometimes a runner on third will just stay there.  This is the biggest AI glitch to be found in the game.  It really won't happen or affect a game too often, but you will certainly see it happen.  Beyond that, however, the AI should be commended.  No, it's not quite as exact and realistic as High Heat on the PS2, but WSB does a great job of capturing the feel of baseball and eliminating the majority of AI bugs that plague baseball games.  If WSB has any real problems, it's that it doesn't do enough of some things.  There are broken bats, but you hardly see them.  There are sacrifice bunts, pitchouts, pickoff attempts, and stolen bases, but you don't see them nearly enough.  In fact, you won't see homers enough either.  When was the last time you said that about a baseball game?  How about never.  The scores are usually tight, with only the occasional blowout.  Most important, the game is fun.  Incredibly fun.  After over fifty games, I'm still in love with WSB.  When you get a homer and you get that slight jolt to the controller, it's like magic.  Yeah, sometimes you do get a five-homer game, but that happens in the bigs too.  On All-star , with all the adjustable settings maxed out, it will be hard for anyone to hit 100 homers in a season.  Helping with the realistic feel of the game is the numerous ability ratings.  You don't just get the standard ~average~ and ~power~ ratings, WSB kicks in a ton of other ratings you've never seen before in a console game.  Things like strikeout and walk ratings as well as speed and stolen base abilities.  Not bad at all.    Franchise Mode WSB has a relatively weak feature set.  The Home Run Derby is too ordinary, lacking in a solid presentation.  The create-a-player is also on the weaker side.  You can only enter the first initial and short last name for a player, and there are only four stats that can be assigned points.  Considering how many ability ratings are in the game, four is far too few.  Normally this lack of features would really hurt a game, but it's not detrimental to WSB thanks to its amazing franchise mode.  World Series Baseball has one of the best franchise modes of any sports game yet.  What makes it really unique is the addition of coaches and scouts, whom you draft just like players.  There's a manager, pitching coach, hitting couch, scouting director, and minor league director.  Their ratings effect how you evaluate talent, your ability to find new talent and develop it, and the ability to continue to develop players at the major league level.  Coaches have contracts, just like players, and some are truly bad coaches.  Your scouting director affects how you see player ratings and potential.  A bad scout may overrate a player or misjudge their potential.  That can be pretty significant when attempting to draft players and make trades.  This new dynamic makes managing a franchise far more about strategy than in the past.  Franchise mode can last until infinity too.  New players are generated with the combination of major league names.  So you get Ichiro Guerrero and Hideo Bonds.  As funny as it is, it also creates an odd sense of familiarity.  Even though Hideo Bonds likely plays nothing like Barry or Nomo, the familiar names help keep the game from becoming impersonal twenty seasons down the line.  Team trades are sometimes stupid (Ichiro for Roger Clemens??), but they come at a pace similar to the majors.  You won't see teams making dozens of moves, but you will see a flurry of action the week before the trading deadline.  And trades aren't easy to come by.  Teams will be more willing to trade for what they need rather than just trading for any good talent.  The trade screen shows your team's weak points and the weak points of the team you're trading with.  The franchise mode should be Sega's selling point, because it's the best part of the game.    Graphics WSB is the prettiest baseball game around.  It's not perfection though, as there are some jaggies.  The baselines and pitcher's mound are the biggest offenders when it comes to jaggies, but the character models are nice and smooth.  The only other real knock against WSB is the lack of stadium interactivity.  In ASB the train comes by in Seattle and the giant apple pops up in Shea Stadium following a home run.  There's none of that in WSB.  The stadiums themselves are beautifully rendered and populated with a colorful crowd, but would it really have taken that much to make the stadiums truly come to life?  The players look and move the best of any baseball game on any console.  Height, size, girth, are all well-recreated and some of the player faces look incredibly accurate.  Not every face is perfect though.  While Jermaine Dye and Valdimir Guerrero look like spitting images of their real-life counterparts, Eric Chavez doesn't look nearly as sharp.  Overall though, the faces are almost eerily accurate.  Players have the appropriate stances, though you won't see Nomar step out of the box after every pitch and adjust his gloves three times.  Those well-known nuances would have been a nice touch.  WSB is the only baseball game to feature self-shadowing.  This means the players cast shadows on their own bodies.  You can see the shadow of the bat move on a player's shoulder as they waggle it at the plate.  While it may seem like a minor addition to a game, it adds a surprising amount of realism to the visuals.  WSB also includes a throwback uniform for each team.  And Blue Shift made certain to use the ugliest uniform from each team's past.  Where WSB truly succeeds and surpasses the competition is with animations.  You will not find smoother or more varied fielding animations in any baseball game.  Each game will provide you with at least one fielding animation that will get you ooing.  Fielders dive, throw from their knees, make off-balanced throws, and crash into the outfield wall.  The only player collisions, however, involve base runners and catchers.  Anywhere else on the field and base runners will run through the fielder.  There are also no wall catches, which really need to be in there.  No, it doesn't happen all that often in baseball, but if you watch enough games you know that it happens with enough frequency to be included.  The stadiums are gorgeous, filled with detail and color.  The best visual comes on foul balls, when you see the ball soar towards the stands and catch sight of the nighttime sky.  You'll catch birds flying by every now and then, a nice extra.  Though in truth, the only birds I ever see flying around real games are seagulls and pigeons looking for the perfect spectator to bomb.  For the most part, you can see the ball hit the bat, the ball go into a fielders glove, and infielders step on base or tag a runner.  From time to time, however, the ball will appear to suddenly jump into a glove and a tag will seem to be missed but an out still called.  This is true in every baseball game and WSB is the least offensive in this department, but it does happen and you will notice it.    Sound Best sound in a sports game ever.  Not so bold a statement since most sports games seem to totally ignore quality sound and go for the standard crowd roars that have been used for the past decade.  WSB makes great use of 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  The typical crowd sounds have a nice mix of whistles and cheer variants, but what really makes it stand out are the player-specific taunts.  Coming from the rear speakers, so it feels like the jeers are coming from behind the batter, baseball patrons offer encouragement to the home team and rude comments for visiting players.  Here's just a small sampling of taunts: (to Eric Chavez) ~You suck Chavez!~ (to Vlad Guerrero) ~You're overrated Guerrero!~ (to John Vander Wal) ~More like John Vander AWOL!~ (to Miguel Tejada) ~Nice going E6!~ (To Manny Ramirez) ~Hey Manny, how's the Boston Tea?!~ (at Wrigley Field) ~Knock it onto Waveland!~ (to Jose Cruz Jr.) ~You should try to learn something from your father!~  Crowds also react to situations.  A rally in the bottom of the ninth will elicit louder cheers and the crowd boos when the opponent crosses home plate.  The play-by-play team of Ted Robinson and Mike Krukow is nicely understated.  Where other games try to have the play-by-play dominate the sound field, WSB has a much more laid back approach.  The comments are less intrusive and come less often than what you might expect.  The subtle nature of the commentary has several effects.  For one, it lets the sounds of the game stand out more, better immersing you in the game.  Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, with less to say, there's a lot less repetition.  Though you will hear a few statements far too many times, it's nice not to be overwhelmed by the same rhetoric again and again.  The comments are almost always accurate, but it's odd to hear ~he's not gonna win any Gold Gloves, but if I were a pitcher I'd want him playing behind me,~ when they're talking about Eric Chavez -- a guy who won a Gold Glove last year.  Throw in several different tunes that play in the background, some fine PA announcing, and some humorous barbs and you have a great sounding game.  The channels are used properly, so the announcers come from the center speaker while the crowd is filtered mostly through the rear speakers, giving to a real sense of being on the field.  Hopefully other companies will see just how much sound can add to a sports title.   WSB has flaws, but less so than any other baseball game released this year.  The successes of WSB far outweigh any shortcomings.  The problem of too many homers has been solved.  The franchise mode is phenomenal and the animations and gameplay are superior to previous baseball releases.  WSB is a great pick-up for any baseball fan.  There's a lot that could be improved on, but that's why they make a new one each year. Best baseball game ever?  Yeah.", "date": "May 31, 2002"}
