Initial reaction, name alone, what would you guess? Dance Dance Revolution knock-off? Fashion-accessorizing simulator? Whatever you might expect, it probably wouldn't be a fresh, creative and original platforming design - but that's exactly what you'll find here. Put aside the Barbie brand and prepare to be pleasantly surprised, because these dancing princesses have all the right moves.    Based on a recent straight-to-DVD movie, The 12 Dancing Princesses casts Barbie as Genevieve, seventh of a dozen sisters. That's a lot of daughters to deal with, so the widower King invites his cousin, the Duchess Rowena, to come to the castle and help raise them all. Rowena is evil, of course. She poisons the king and captures 11 of the 12 girls, locking them up in various hiding places around the castle. It's up to Genevieve to explore the expansive estate, rescue her sisters, find and defeat Rowena and save her father from his poison-induced perpetual slumber.    At first you'll find gameplay taking the form of a very basic platformer. Genevieve can walk, and jump, and walk some more. But the limit on her abilities doesn't last long - once you stumble across the first set of kidnapped sisters, they grant their sibling the power to attack enemies with a butterfly net. Later, more sisters offer the power to cross previously impassable gaps with magic stilts. And then you can make staircases out of ribbons, and get a mallet to hit croquet balls that operate switches, and...    You end up with a lot of different abilities. The touch screen keeps track of them all, letting you switch between the powers with a quick tap of an icon there. The game is scaled in complexity, built to take advantage of the greater variety in executable actions available in later levels - like a Metroid or Castlevania title, you don't start with much, but have quite an arsenal assembled by game's end. The formula works for games in those franchises, and also works here - the pace at which new powers are activated is not too fast or too slow, and finding out what Genevieve will be able to do next is good motivation to see the adventure through to its conclusion.    You'll want to keep playing for the later levels, too, because of the flair in design exhibited there - a Castlevania-esque clock tower and a haunting hall of mirrors round out Genevieve's journey, and are home to some of the title's most interesting platforming ideas. The mirror rooms, in particular, are imaginative. You'll have to navigate Genevieve through two parallel planes, with platforms and switches appearing in only one of the two, but affecting progress in both. The only downside to seeing these truly unique concepts is that they're pushed to the endgame - most of the early-going in the adventure is just basic jumping from place to place.    Basic, too, could describe the title's graphical presentation. The 12 Dancing Princesses is a GBA+ affair, meaning that its look is just a small upgrade over what you'd find on the Game Boy Advance. The animation is good and the environments vibrant, but the DS has power left untapped in this area.       A few system-specific features are brought in along the way, though. You'll encounter raging fires in several levels, and these must be extinguished by blowing into the DS mic. The double-tall display of the two-screened system comes into play too, in some interstitial mini-games where Genevieve's pet cat Twyla takes the spotlight for some forced-scroll platforming challenges. And challenge is right - these breaks from the main quest are a lot tougher than the rest of the game.    Twyla's mini-games join a few others in a front-end menu screen, adding some replayability to the game after the 12 sisters have been rescued and the kingdom saved. Butterfly Catching is one, Ribbon Racing is another, and a time trial run through a massive library is the third - but none of these miniature diversions is very deep or engaging. You'll probably only play through them and the main quest once, but you may revisit the clock tower and hall of mirrors for another run-through or two. Barbie in The 12 Dancing Princesses is a refreshing surprise, offering much more innovation and fun that you'd expect to find in a product brought to you by Mattel. Its challenge is low, making it a great choice for younger gamers just starting to discover platformers. The only thing holding the title back is its limited use of the DS's power  the graphics, sound and overall feel of the game are still solidly Game Boy.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
