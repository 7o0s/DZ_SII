Many gamers will also notice Higgin's romps to be perilously close to those of SEGA's hero Wonder Boy. This mobile release brings back some very classic, very playable old-school platforming action that the twentysomethings will like and the thirtysomethings will love.   Super Adventure Island is a mild cross been platformer and RPG. Higgins has his basic assortment of action moves, such as running and jumping, to choose from. Pits must be leapt across and ledges must be scaled. And then there are the plentiful enemies, which can be shattered with a toss of Higgin's axe. There are bosses at the end of several levels that must be conquered, too, with the tried-and-true methodology of pattern memorization.   But between these platforming essentials, Higgins must collect coins and spend them on gear. Better boots increase speed and jumping capabilities. Upgraded armor will repel damage from enemies. Higgins can also purchase special attacks, such as tornados and fireballs to help out in a pinch. These small RPG elements add a lot to Super Adventure Island.   We played Super Adventure Island on an LG VX8000 all weekend. Control was tight -- we never had a problem jumping across ponds or swimming in just the right direction. Throwing axes was easy and quite responsive.   Super Adventure Island is a real looker. The resurrected 8-bit/16-bit day-glo worlds are bright and fantastical. Sprites are excellently detailed, appearing every bit as retro as required. The game music is also appropriately bouncy.  I was a mark for this game from the moment I turned it on -- Super Wonderboy in Monsterland for the Master System is one of my favorite games -- ever. And Super Adventure Island is a great recreation of the adventure, as well as the era. If you have anything resembling a passing interest in platformers, Super Adventure Island should be high on your ~must download~ list. This is great mobile fun.", "date": "Jun 14, 2005"}
