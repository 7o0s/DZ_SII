I am a huge fan of Civilization. I've wasted countless hours playing ~just one more turn.~ Civilization II did a great job of updating the game in my opinion and I can't wait to see what happens when Civilization III comes out next year. In the meantime, Test of Time will have to do. It's really more of an add-on than a new game in itself. You get three new versions of the Civ game and one new scenario. There are those of us who didn't have the patience to us the icon editor in the second game and didn't care to play the Fantastic Worlds version of the game. Test of Time allows you to get your Sci-Fi or Fantasy fix in a more traditional Civ-type game.  Fans of the previous games will be very familiar with the fundamentals of play here. There's really almost no change at all. And that means that you'll have some of the same frustrations too. City management still becomes an nearly impossible task later in the game. The addition of a production queue (one of the only improvements made by the disappointing Call to Power) would've been nice, but they're not here. While some players literally salivate over the prospect of so much micro-management, it eventually begins to irritate me. Also missing are the neat datalinks that made Alpha Centauri a lot more manageable. But even so, this is Civilization, so the strengths of the original game are still here. I'm just sorry that more wasn't done to streamline the city management.  A few things have improved though. First of all, the AI in ToT is much stronger. While there are still some obvious flaws--such as the AI's inability to use air units effectively--the enemy leaders in this game are pretty sharp. They're much better at negotiations now and frequently initiate alliances and wars--not only with you, but also with each other. One of the things that really used to cheese me off was the ability of enemy settler units to completely ignore your zones of control. If you've played the game for any length of time, you know what I'm talking about. You're just minding your own business when, BAM, there's an enemy city right next to one of yours. Although that glitch has been fixed, settler automation is still horrible. They never seem to do things right. It doesn't matter too much at the start of the game, but once you've got 30 settlers to manage, it can really tick you off.  So let's talk a little bit about the worlds. For the purists, there's a copy of the original Civ2 game. If you've played it before, you're not going to be surprised by anything. The designers have also included an Extended Original Game that really lives up to its name. If you think the standard Civ game is long, you're in for a shock. You start out on Earth on day one. You progress through the regular Civ game until you're able to launch a spaceship to Centaurus. But the game's not over. Oh no. Not by a long shot. In a seven player game, there's a rival civilization that's been developing on Centaurus since the beginning. Expect them to be highly developed. They even have access to a few exclusive technologies and units. The game isn't over until a civilization develops Transcendence--which, by the way, doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as it did in Alpha Centauri. Although it requires tremendous endurance to even get close to finishing the Extended game, it adds a neat twist, not to mention a sense of urgency, to the game.  But let's get on to the Sci-Fi and Fantasy games. Each has a narrative that unfolds as you progress through the technology tree and I was surprised at how well developed these world stories were. Each world features a ~new~ set of technologies, wonders and improvements. The kicker is that they're just versions of the regular Civ stuff with new names and icons. The tech trees have been rearranged a little bit, but the progressions are still pretty much the same. One neat addition is that several of the advances are now race specific. There are many advances that you won't ever be able to research, no matter how hard you try. The only way to get at these advances is through trade or theft. That adds a really interesting element to the game. Now you have to cooperate with other races in order to get all the advances. And some of these are very, very powerful.  Although the units are different in terms of stats, they still fall into familiar categories--phalanx, caravan, bomber, diplomat, settler, etc. Unit abilities are pretty standard as well, but quite a few units come with a new ability--teleportation. Each of the two new worlds are composed of four levels. The Sci-Fi world consist of four separate planets. The Fantasy world, and Midgard scenario, are made up of four planes. Teleportation allows some units to travel freely between levels. The trick here is that some of your enemies could be lurking just below or above the surface of your world, waiting to strike at the unprotected interior of your empire. Of course, it makes a good strategy for you, too (evil laughter).  The Sci-Fi game begins just after the crash of your colony ship on a strange planet. You must rebuild society while fighting off the other inhabitant of the system. The goal is to colonize each of the four planets and eventually return home. Although it's a high-tech game, the initial advances are fairly primitive--despite their new, high-tech names. You must relearn the skills and technologies from the original game. The Flood Prediction advance functions just like Bridge Building, for example. One big change is that this level offers early access to flight techs. Also of interest are the Blue Willies, which take the place of Fanatics. You get them under the Great Joining government advance, which takes the place of...you guessed it, Fanaticism.  As you might expect, the Fantasy game is filled with all sorts of elves and goblins and stuff. Once again, almost everything is just like it was in Civ2 except with a different name. The Huginn and Munnin advance is just like the Apollo Program--you get to see the whole map and all races can begin production of Siege Engines (sort of like nukes). The Altar of Enlightenment Wonder functions like Michaelangelo's Chapel and the Golden Orchard merely acts as a Granary in all of your cities. Sound familiar? Yup, it's real familiar. New units are very impressive like Dragons and Frost Giants. For most of these units, the requisite advance is Ally with (whatever). Not all races have access to these advances either so you better play real friendly-like with the other folks.  The Midgard scenario is based on the Fantasy game. The races include Stygians, Merfolk, Infidels and others. The goal here is to hold back Armageddon by destroying Volsang. This is accomplished one of three ways: kill everyone else; build the Great Seige Engine; or locate Bifrost and call in the help of the Asgardians.  Advances such as Arachnid Husbandry will give you a cool new military unit, while Empyrean Lore allows you to build this world's equivalent of Marco Polo's Embassy. The Dragons and Frost Giants are here too, as is my favorite new unit, The Unspeakable Horror. Nasty.  The Glyph of Understanding wonder is the Midgard equivalent of The Organ Bank wonder in the Sci-Fi world. And, except for the name, both are exactly like Women's Suffrage wonder in the original game. It was frustrating at first to have to puzzle out what the wonders and advances did only to discover that they're just like the old game. The Eye of Ran loses some of its charm once you realize that it's just a Lighthouse in disguise. On the other hand, once you know that it's the Lighthouse, it's a lot easier to play the game. To put it simply, Test of Time brings a few new things to the game but is really little more than a novel add-on. Sci-Fi and Fantasy games are a lot of fun once you get past the weird names for everything. It's a great game, but it's standing on the shoulders of one of the all-time greats. Is it any less good because it fails to revolutionize the series? Not in my book, baby.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Aug 14, 1999"}
