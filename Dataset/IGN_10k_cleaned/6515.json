With such limited deck space, the tactic makes sense -- if you have a good experience with other games in, say, Gameloft's Midnight series, you might be more inclined to look into other games bearing the name. Midnight Bowling 3D is the latest title from Gameloft to come under the banner, and predictably, it is a worthy entry.   Midnight Bowling 3D distinguishes itself fromt he litany of other bowling games not necessarily by offering different play mechanics -- after all, how many different ways can you simulate bowling on a cell phone -- but through highly amusing presentation. The Midnight banner has always been about coolness, glitz, and sass, and Midnight Bowling 3D does not deviate from this successful formula.   Case in point? Midnight Bowling 3D makes a nod to the cult flick ~The Big Lebowski~ through one of its characters, Moses.    Midnight Bowling 3D offers several play modes: For players that prefer to see their competition, you can simply pass the phone back and forth. There is a quick play game for immediately jumping into the action with only a five-frame game, and a tournament mode for a more in-depth single-player experience. In tournament mode, you play against the aforementioned lippy computer-controlled gamers, unlocking new characters, outfits, and bowling balls.   The game mechanics are what you would expect from a mobile bowler. You line up your shot, choose the power and the vector of the roll. However, once the ball is in play, you can give it a little extra roll to the left or right with the thumbpad, allowing you some post-roll corrections.   Midnight Bowling 3D looks very, very nice. The alleys are shown off with cool camera angles, so you see every inch of gaudiness and glitter. The character designs are fun, and well constructed for a 3D mobile game. The view of the action when getting ready to roll is clean, and the meters are big enough for good players to nail accurate rolls. Also slick? Gameloft has implemented a replay feature here not unlike Massive Snowboarding that shows off your successful strikes and spares. You control the camera in these replays, so you can watch the strike from a variety of angles. It's just a cool add-on to an already well-produced game. The audio is solid, too, with Beyonce's ~Naughty Girl~ playing over the title screen.   Midnight Bowling 3D is another class production from Gameloft -- but by this point, did you expect anything different? If you already have a bowling game you are satisfied with, such as the standard-bearer JAMDAT Bowling, the need to upgrade might not be there. However, if you have a 3D-enabled handsets currently sans bowling sim, there are few reasons not to download Midnight Bowling 3D. It's a great, casual game that anybody can get into and it has attitude to spare. (Sorry.)", "date": "Dec 14, 2005"}
