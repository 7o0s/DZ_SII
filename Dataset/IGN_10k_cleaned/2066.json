In a sentence, this game is just frustrating.  Staged in a dark, semi-futuristic environment, Excalibur 2555 AD is a 3D adventure game that allows gamers to take the role of a sexy pixalated woman by the name of Beth... you know, that's my grandma's name.  Anyway, the graphics in this game look like poo. The rendered enemies flop around like stapled hunks of meat, the level designs are bland, and Beth, the character you're playing as, looks like a bargain-rack version of Madonna. The game is just painful to see. It's like the developers were just pissed about making this game.  The sound in this game...ghhaaarrr! The voices have no enthusiasm and possess the cheapest english accents. And the music. It reminds me of a strip club that I use to go to - but it's closed down now. It just sounds bad.  All in all, the story is there, but the graphics and gameplay have simply left the building. We suggest you rent this title before you purchase it.", "date": "Oct 23, 1997"}
