Most titles in the action-slash-RPG genre tend to wimp out on one of the elements, but Revenant offers intense action and sufficient character development to stand out above these other titles. While the game world and story may seem a little smallish, there's more than enough adventure to fill you up. Just don't expect a full-course meal. Add to the mix stunning graphics and character animations and you've got a definite winner. Still not convinced? Let's look at the particulars.  The manual describes the cosmology of the world of Ur. It was fashioned by ~the Gods~ as their own, personal playground. As you might expect, a split develops among the gods, and they divide into two warring factions with the rather inventive names of ~Good~ and ~Evil.~ Pardon my editorial chuckle. But all this is of no great concern. The real story starts a little closer to the present. A Great Cataclysm engulfs the land and society divides into two main camps. Little is known of the story except that the Great Cataclysm is blamed on the death of an ~ancient queen.~ Revealing any more would give the story away.  Flash forward to the present; things are rotten in Akhuilon. The Cult of the Change has surfaced on this small island and is bent of spreading general mayhem and chaos across the land. Their most heinous offense is the abduction of Andria, Lord Tendrick's daughter. She has been spirited away and it's up to you to rescue her. You play as Locke, a warrior resurrected from the dead and bound into the service of the house of Tendrick in the city of Misthaven. The agent of the resurrection is one Sardok, the Lord's resident magician. You, as his revenant, are required to do his bidding. This involves travelling from one end of the island to the other in an effort to rescue Andria and stomp out the cult. Simple enough? Hardly.   Although there's no chance to actually create a unique character for the game, there is enough character development and flexibility that Revenant truly deserves to be called a role-playing game. Locke, in his former life, was a warrior and sorcerer of notable stature. As the game progresses, you will have the opportunity to increase Locke's primary attributes and skills. In terms of attribute increases, you merely designate which two of your six attributes to improve. Every time you gain a level, each of these attributes is raised two points. You can even switch which attributes you are working on in the middle of leveling.  But it's the skills that really drive character development. Each successful use of a skill (killing an enemy, casting a spell, and picking a lock) adds to the development points for that skill. Once enough points have been accrued, the skill raises one level. In this manner, your character will grow according to how you use him. If you spend the majority of your time using magic to vanquish your foes, then your character will become a better magician than fighter. If, on the other hand, you prefer the hack and slash style of play, your skills will reflect that. But the best character is one who excels at all aspects and it's not that difficult to change gears during the adventure to focus on one aspect or another.  Control can be handled with the mouse and keyboard, but this game was made to be played with a gamepad. I tried the keyboard option, but it pales in comparison to the gamepad play. Even with the gamepad you'll still need to rely on the mouse-keyboard combination to manage your inventory. This is the only part of the control interface that seemed to get in the way of my enjoying the game. Part of the problem is the quantity of foodstuffs that you'll pick up off of your fallen enemies. What with skeletons dropping heads of lettuce, spiders dropping watermelons and dragons carrying hams and frankfurters, you'll soon have trouble finding necessary items among the smorgasbord of inconsequential food items. Food is useful for healing health and mana, but potions do a better job overall and take up much less space in the inventory.  It's the combat model that most impressed me. Each character in the game has a unique set of combat animations. These are determined by range, type of attack, weapon and a host of other factors. I was constantly surprised by Locke's new moves throughout the game. There are three basic moves; thrust, swing and chop. Along the way, you'll learn other moves from Jong, Lord Tendrick's combat master. The various combination moves make the gamepad a virtual necessity. Each character also has a fatigue rating that limits the amount of moves that they can make in combat before needing to take a break. Fortunately the fatigue rating replenishes itself at a pretty good rate so you can usually just back away from your slower opponents until it builds back up again.  There are three main weapon types in Revenant: swords, axes and bludgeoning instruments. The reach and attack style for each of the weapon types are unique and there are even a few variations within the types as well. I found the sword class to be the most effective in terms of reach and versatility. There are numerous weapons and armors scattered throughout the game that makes the Misthaven weapon and armor shops as unnecessary as the buffet you wind up carrying. The fourth weapon type, bows, has one sole representative in the whole game. Amid the scores of other weapons you pick up, one bow sort of stands out. If the designers were committed to having bows in the game, they should have included more than one. In fact, bows were originally only present in the multiplayer version of Revenant, but one was thrown into the single player game just to help you get past a particularly nasty monster.  The magic system is fairly inventive. It falls back on the idea of combining different talismans to create spells. There are twelve separate talismans in the game, each representing a different aspect of nature -- Earth, Moon, Death, Law, Soul to name a few. Some of the 50 spells in the game require only one talisman; Nourish, for instance, requires only the Life talisman. Other spells, like Warrior Born, require four separate talismans. And you can't just mix them together any old way. They have to be combined in the right order. Special scrolls that you may find will reveal a few of the combinations to you, but if you're like me, you go through most of the permutations in a simple trial and error process until you hit a spell that works. This, quite frankly, is a hole in the game. The inclusion of a chance for backfire for mismatched talismans is sorely needed here. Otherwise an industrious gamer with a lot of time on his hands can search out all the variations until he's discovered all the spells.  But the game would be less than spectacular if the graphics were weak. Don't worry. Revenant has some awesome spell effects and character designs. Although the island of Akhuilon is fairly small, there are several varied areas that you'll travel to. Misthaven's clean, urban look contrasts with the sprawling ruins where the final showdown takes place. The open and airy forest of Akhuilon stands out against the claustrophobic, luminescent caverns that lead to the ruins. The biggest problem in this regard are the jerky load times between map sections. Along the way, you'll run into the nearly 50 enemy types in the game, ranging from human monks to walking dead. Creatures in the swamp include lumbering lurkers and small, frog-like hoppers. Add to that the ubiquitous dragon, and you've got enough baddies to keep things lively. And just wait until you meet the magic-wielding residents of Akhuilon.  Once the single player game is finished, you may feel the urge to compete in the multiplayer version of Revenant. Fight it. The multiplay option here is buggy and unstable. Eidos has promised us that a patch is in the works, so the problems may be ironed out fairly soon. Multiplay pits up to four characters against one another in any of several new game maps. Best of all, you can play as characters other than Locke. They feature in the single player game, but you never really get a chance to know that much about them. Once the patch is out, you can content yourself with playing as an assassin, an ex-soldier and a shaman.  In another vain attempt to add to the replayability, Revenant comes with a level editor. This tool is almost useless, in my opinion. There's precious little instruction, no logical design to the interface and, get this, no support from Eidos whatsoever. They've totally washed their collective hands from dealing with this issue and you can take that as a bad sign.  But these shortcomings are minor. The real meat of the game is the single player adventure and it delivers the goods. I can sit here and go on and on about the impressive combat model, the refined game balance and the polished graphics for animations and effects. In the end, it's about the fun I had playing the game. Sure there are some cliches in the game; some of them are actually pretty blatant. Sure the environment is a little on the small side. Who cares? Revenant gives you what you want -- lots of action, a flexible character and something to pretty to look at. End of story.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Nov 6, 1999"}
