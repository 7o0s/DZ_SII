What we have now is the same game with new, decent Game Boy Color support. Features:  48 levels in single-player mode Password save. Link Cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   The Game Boy Color rendition of Battleship is essentially the same as the board game. You and your opponent (the computer in a one player game, a human if you've got two systems and two copies of the game) have a grid that represents the ocean. At the start of the game, you place four different ships on the playfield, each of differing size. For example, the submarine takes up a single square, but the battleship takes up a whopping five. The layout you choose is completely unknown to your opponent. The idea is simple -- take turns picking squares, guessing where your opponent's ships are hiding. Picking an occupied square will score a hit -- nail all the squares that ship is occupying, and you sink that ship. Sink all your opponent's ships, and you're victorious.  What's unique to the Game Boy Color rendition? Well, apart from the frivolous animation sequences of the missiles flying, boats exploding and sinking, the game has one neat feature: each of your ship has one unique weapon, but that weapon can only be used if that ship is intact -- and it can only be used a limited amount of time.  The battleship, for example, allows the use of the ~harpoon,~ a shot that will hit a group of five squares in a single shot (a pattern that looks like the number five on a die). The submarine has a radar that will reveal if the enemy is hiding his ships under a grouping of four squares. These newer weapons add a bit more strategy to the classic game, and make the game a bit faster to play.  The graphics are quite good, especially considering that this game originally came out as a black-and-white game. The color support is excellent -- it doesn't look rushed.   The only real complaint is playing against the computer -- the AI of the computer opponent is so unpredictable, and it's too suspicious. You just know it knows exactly where your ships are, and it can spank you whenever it wants. It doesn't look like it follows any set pattern to kill your ships -- even when it has hit your ship, it'll guess a square way off the mark. And sometimes it looks like it knows exactly the right places to look. Battleship is a great two-player game, but I don't really like playing the computer -- it's just unnatural to play this game without having your opponent to mock. And besides, the AI just works a bit too conveniently sometimes. As a two-player game, it's very good. It may be a bit slow for most people expecting a lot of action, but it's a great alternative to strategy games like chess. And it's a lot more violent, too!", "date": "Sep 27, 1999"}
