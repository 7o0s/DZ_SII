{"name": "Lemmings 3D", "name_review": "Lemmings 3D", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/26/lemmings-3d", "text": "The original Lemmings was quite a hit on the PC, and broke Psygnosis into the world game market. Lemmings 3D carries on that puzzler's tradition, but brings it up to date with a 3D slant.  Those darn lemmings are still trying to kill themselves en masse, so it's up to you to stop them. This is accomplished by assigning specific tasks to different lemmings, such as blocker, to prevent lemmings from going beyond that point, turners, etc. As the game is extremely challenging, you're given the chance to practice each of the tasks before you proceed to the next wave, ~Fun.~  The graphics are nice enough, with the simple, colorful backgrounds and detailed structures, but compared to something like Jumping Flash! it looks a little barren. The control is easy to use, just point the cursor and assign tasks. The focus here is on strategy and gameplay, and Lemmings 3D certainly delivers. I miss the huge mob of Lemmings wandering towards their doom. I miss the particle effects of a Lemmings explosion. I miss the character voices during the game. I miss the clever animations of some of the specific Lemmings deaths. And I miss a cool Lemmings introduction that's been included in nearly every version of the game since it began on the Amiga. Lemmings is still a fun puzzle game, but the Game Boy Color version is completely devoid of life and character, and the technical limitations are enough to stray away from these portable critters. Want a great version to take on the go? The Atari Lynx version is still the tops. Perhaps Take 2 can port the Amiga version to the Game Boy Advance next year... but today, the GBC can't cut it.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
