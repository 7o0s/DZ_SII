A quick visit to its Website shows off as many as 14 downloadable games prepped to whittle off hours from your busy day. Why waste one's time in such a manner? Aren't there more important things to do, people to meet, places to go? Give Bejeweled 2 less than five minutes and you'll see your day, like dangerous Rebellion galaxies, slip through your fingers.   One of the first Xbox Live Arcade games on Microsoft's popular Marketplace, Bejeweled 2 is essentially the exact same game as Bejeweled 1, but with ~high definition~ graphics, new modes of play, and special puzzle modes based on a limited number of moves. Bejeweled 2 is also available on several other media, such as PC, Macs, and cellular phones. Xbox 360 is just one of many places to find this uber-popular game, and despite its wide availability, it's very worth playing on Xbox 360.    The big deal? Bejeweled 2 consists of a 2D grid in which various colored pieces can be moved, one at a time, to create threesomes, foursomes, and fivesomes to gain high scores and Achievements. By moving items either horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) players shift pieces to create double moves (which eliminate two sets of colors simultaneously), power gems (four in a row create an explosive single gem), or hyper cubes (a fusion of five gems eliminates all gems of one color on the board). The simple trick to Bejeweled 2 is that you can only make one move at a time and each move must connect at least three same-colored gems. Seems simple, right? Not so. You'll often find there are no more moves left, or, depending on the type of game mode chosen, no time left. Bejeweled 2 requires skill based on logic, pattern recognition, and concentration. Surprisingly, achievements are hard to get, perhaps even too hard. But I guess they don't call it ~Bejeweled~ for nothing.    The sequel offers a handful of new modes. Classic mode is the original un-timed game. Play as long as you want, as long as you can make a move. Puzzle mode presents a series of distinct puzzles often requiring a set number of moves, a time limit, or both. This is more focused puzzle-solving that's like a mini-game within a mini-game. Action mode will make a competitor out of you. Arcade gamers must beat the clock under a time limit to progress though the levels -- it's harder than it sounds. This mode forces you to think two to three steps ahead to nail power gems and hyper cubes to beat the relentless clock. And finally, there is good ol' Endless mode, which gives you the excuse to never stop at all. Wasting time was never as easy and as fun as in Endless Mode. Just make sure to tell your girlfriend you're gone for the day.     Visually, PopCap's game defines simplicity. There are some nifty psychedelic loading screens that are fun for a spell, but essentially it's like a graphic mixture of Gummy Bears and checkers. The newly implemented interface and easy to use tutorial are nice additions, and the simple layout is quick to get accustomed to. Sonically, the music mixes easy-to-listen-to keyboard tunes that share similarities to Enya and Kenny G, but is more likeable than either. What's more, the tunes work on a subconscious level perfectly suiting this type of brain-teasing activity.   The main additions and changes I'd love to see are these: after losing in a level, I wish I could see the move I should have made. A little replay showing a better way would make me a better player. Additional music types and changes in the graphics would create more motion and variation, which is always a good thing. A two-player variation would be super, freakin' hot. And maybe, just maybe, the Achievements could be a touch less difficult to nab.You should play Bejeweled 2. It's that simple. But should you play the Xbox 360 version? It's practically free on many other systems, and you could technically just play the Flash version online or the trial version over and over again. The simple fact is now you can play it on Xbox 360. It's great, time-wasting fun worth having for 800 Microsoft Points, just because you can. If you like the concept behind Achievements and added leaderboards, this will fit the bill sweetly.", "date": "Jun 13, 2006"}
