THQ Wireless has released a handful of MotoGP racers for mobile, culminating in this year's fourth edition. Developer Rockpool has done a solid job recreating the excitement of the sport while maintaining the slightly casual angle of mobile. Think Hang-On with a little bit more realism.   MotoGP 4 uses a handful of licensed riders and real world tracks, such as Le Mans and Laguna Seca. The tracks feature all the same hairpins and dead-heat straight-aways of their asphalt counterparts. These things may not necessarily impress a player not into the motorsport, but the level of detail is great for the hardcore.   Rockpool has included a quick race mode just to get an idea of the road ahead. I suggest you start there so you can get the hang of the mechanics -- driving a bike in MotoGP is not like racing a car in, say, Fast and the Furious. Correction is the key to success. You don't just throw the bike into a turn and then let go. You must press the opposite way when coming out of the turn, putting your rider back on balance. It's a good feature that keeps you on your toes. The relatively decent controls work well for cornering. I preferred to use 1 and 3 to corner with auto-acceleration when ramping up for bigger challenges.   Once you have the hang of the correction, dive into the career mode. You can create a rider, name him, and then dole out stat points in categories like top speed, acceleration, and cornering. Winning races gives you extra points. (First place, for example, grants you seven stat points.) In your career, you attack each track, racing against the real-deal riders. You can run a heat just to check the track out, then go into the actual race for points.   The AI is pretty solid. The other riders aren't merciless, but they will capitalize on your mistakes (especially if you corner too hard) and cut you off if given half a chance. Also affecting the race is weather. You will race during broad daylight, wicked rain, and other conditions. Rain really affects corning, so make sure you try out a rain-slick course in the quick race mode before racing for position.   As you progress deeper into the circuit, MotoGP 4 gets hard -- and to the point that only perfectionists will stick around. That point is many races on the horizon, but still, I suspect casual gamers will have likely steered away from this one the moment they heard it was about motorcycle racing.   I played MotoGP 4 on a Sony Ericsson w810i, a pretty solid gaming phone. The 2D edition of MotoGP 4 looked pretty good, with fine framerates and a decent amount of detail in the riders and bikes. The backdrops are a little bland, though.  MotoGP 4 will certainly satisfy hardcore fans of the sport. The controls demand attention, but as soon as you get the hang of correcting your turns, you'll be set to place well for the first few races of your career. When MotoGP 4 decided to turn up the juice, though, it offers a great deal of challenge. Casual games should stay away, but fans will find a lot to like in MotoGP 4.", "date": "Sep 12, 2007"}
