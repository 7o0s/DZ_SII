But when it comes to the prop planes of the two World Wars, there's nothing that can keep me away. That's why I was so excited to get some time behind the stick of the sequel to Combat Flight Sim. And the fact that this version takes the action to the Pacific Theater is an added bonus. This new version of Combat Flight Sim offers fantastic plane models and great flight modeling for the more hardcore sim fan. But even the less fanatical players will find some rewards here.  The one thing that this game has all the competition beat on is realism. CFS2 has the most realistic plane models I've ever seen in a game. You can get right up on the planes and see all kinds of minute detail. From the individual rivets in the skin to weathering effects on the leading edges of the wings to the smoke discoloration around the gun muzzles.  There are a few spots where the sun shines through the plane models (where the parts don't exactly fit) but you can get as close to these planes as you like without losing any of the details. And the animations on all of the control surfaces and landing systems are amazing too. It's not like you'll need to slide the hood of the cockpit back or anything, but the fact that the game models that action is great. The flaps move up and down, the tailhook extends and retracts and the landing gear comes out very convincingly.  There's also a really fantastic visual damage model. You can see the wings blow off and cartwheel through the air; you can see your bullets punch holes in the fuselage and cockpit; you can see smoke trailing from damaged engines. Fires and explosions are almost as well done as the smoke (although rather than being true 3D voluminous explosions, these tend to look a little more two dimensional). The smoke effects are really great though and it's so satisfying to shoot up an enemy and see him start trailing smoldering. Of all the plane effects, the ones I was least impressed with were the tracer effects. They seem a bit cartoony to me, but that's because I've been spoiled by the fantastic tracer fire in B-17.  The realism of the planes extends into the flight model as well. Rather than being an arbitrary system of tolerances and limits, CFS2 actually uses real physics and aerodynamics to render flight. This makes things a lot easier as the developers can design a plane based on historical data and be reasonably certain that it will perform accurately once it's plugged into the flight engine. The original goal was to make sure all planes performed to within 5% of their real world tolerances. It is a testament to the team working on this game, that nearly all tolerances (stalls, speed at altitude, stability, maneuverability, etc.) are within 1% of their historical values.  As we've said before, this is more on the hardcore side of simulation. There's a sliding scale of course so you can set up the flight model the way you like it, but overall, even the easy model is kind of unforgiving. And to be honest, it's just not as fun. It's the full realism flight model that really delivers. And there are marked differences between the planes. The Corsair has frequent torque problems, the Zeke rolls at a much lower rate than the Wildcat, and the Hellcat stall recovery is darn near inevitable. That brings me to another point. Stalls, although modeled well, bring up a complaint. Apart from a small flashing light, you receive little warning that a stall is imminent. I mean, you can check your airspeed if you want, but I would've liked some kind of wind buffet noise to signal the stalls. As it is, it's not that difficult to see one coming, but in the midst of a dogfight, you need all the help you can get.  For those of you who haven't read the preview let me recap the planes. The player can fly only seven of the game's 18 planes, although you can import planes you design yourself as well as those planes from previous Flight Simulators. The American planes include the Wildcat, Hellcat, Corsair and Lightning. The Lightning might seem like an odd-man out until you consider that top-scoring Pacific ace Dick Bong flew the Lightning. On the Japanese side you can fly both the A6M2 and A6M5 version of the Zeke and the George. There's a nice balance on both sides of durability versus agility.  While there's a good range of planes to choose from, I'd love to have seen a little more on the Japanese side. I think the George is a great plane and well worth the time to simulate, but what about the Tojo or the Nick? I can live with the four planes on the American side but the lack of torpedo and bomber planes for either side is kind of irritating. Some members of the development team have told me that bombers and torpedo planes were omitted because there's less excitement and action in those types of missions. I don't know that I buy that but it's a shame that you can't climb into the cockpit of the Avenger or the Dauntless or the Kate or the Val. For what it's worth, the code to include torpedoes on planes is in the game, so prospective aeronautical engineers could design these planes and put them in as flyable craft. Still, it would have been nice to include them out of the box.  There are two campaigns in the game  one for the Japanese and one for the Americans. You can't pick a service and you can't pick a base but you do get to pick a starting date. The missions are historically themed but not necessarily historical themselves. In other words, they are meant to be representative of the type of missions flown but not necessarily genuinely historical. The number of mission types is pretty broad with combat air patrol, close air support, escort, intercept, naval and ground strike and all kinds of others. A few short scenes tie the missions together, but a sense of pilot development and the war's progression is kind of lacking here.  But there are about six or seven missions on each side that represent some of the major actions of the war (Midway, Santa Cruz, etc.). I was disappointed to see that the historical missions were only available in the campaigns though. If you want to fight the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot, you've got to arrive at it through the normal course of the campaign. It would be much better to include some sort of single mission option to allow you to jump into your favorite historical battle and see how you can handle it.  And most of the single missions involve the exploits of some ace. You have to equal their scores in particular engagements. Overall there's a nice range of mission types in the ace missions. My main complaint is that you're not given the opportunity to better the ace. Once you reach the ace's score, the mission ends, regardless of what's going on around you. This stinks. Let's say you're flying an ace mission where the original ace downed three enemy planes while flying bomber escort  once you shoot down three planes, the game ends. I would have preferred to see the mission through to the end (especially if I'm on a role) but the designers decide to cut you off just as things are getting good.  There are a few other nice things mission-wise, like the tutorials that teach you all kinds of WW2 maneuvers and tactics (which work much better in the tutorials than they do in the real game). A graphical mission builder has also been included to expand the game further. To be honest, it's not that hard to make a simple mission with it. It's actually just a version of the same tool that the scenario designer used to create the missions in the game.  And to keep you company in these missions, CFS2 offers a much more improved wingman model than the previous game. Wingmen are more than just shields in this game and there's a definite incentive to keep them alive from mission to mission. There's much more personality to them this time around, but really, they still seem mostly anonymous to me. And though the competent ones are really good they can still do some stupid things (like crash into your ass after you land) and they don't get anywhere near the same number of kills that you get, but they do seem to be a little smarter than they were in the first game. I found that both the wingmen and the enemy pilots have a much better sense of energy management than before. You'll find them both pulling off some really intelligent moves.  If you'd like some smarter wingmen, you can try to play online via the, ugh, Zone. Thing is I haven't found a single person playing online since I started playing the final two weeks ago. Hopefully more folks will join in once the game has been out for a while. I can say that the few LAN games I've played, including one with some guys on the development team were really spectacularly fun. There's not a lot of nuance or complication here  you shoot them down before they shoot you down.  I've been a huge fan of Aces of the Pacific and it's really clear that some of the same things that made that game so fantastic are present in CFS2. In fact, Tucker Hatfield, producer of CFS2, helped to create AoP as well. In the end, the former game is a lot more approachable but that doesn't necessarily mean it's more rewarding. CFS2 may require a little more attention and skill to play, but that kind of play style has its own benefits too. There are a lot of fantastic flight sims coming out this year (at least I hope most of them make it by the holidays) and CFS2 is definitely a worthy contender.  -- Stephen Butts Want to share your opinions with the world?
