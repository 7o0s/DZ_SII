Other works like ~Through the Looking Glass~ and ~Gulliver's Travels~ offered similar adventures and served a healthy portion of social commentary to go with it. This fantasy has fueled humankind's imagination for centuries. So it makes perfect sense translating such a common dream into a graphical point-and-click adventure, right?    Well, yeah, it does. Too bad the folks at Micro Application, makers of Journey to the Center of the Earth, missed the mark. Sure, it's only 20 bucks and offers some 30+ hours of adventuring. But these 30 hours are made up of illogical puzzles and shallow characters. And the story, while entertaining, fails to invoke a genuine sense of mystery needed to keep playing the game.   Most of Journey to the Center of the Earth's problems (and charms) sneak up within the first hour of play. You'll assume the role of Ariane, a spunky photojournalist on assignment in Iceland. Ariane lands on a volcano hoping to nab Pulitzer worthy photos. As she scurries about snapping shots, an earthquake causes boulders to slide down the volcano and demolish the helicopter she arrived in. Upon inspecting the remains, she notices her pilot has gone missing. She creeps into a nearby cave in search of him only to fall through a hole and wake up on a mysterious beach.   Admittedly, the game gets off to a decent start, but the problems start coming fast and furious. By inspecting the downed helicopter, Ariane's inventory balloons from one item to 12. Play for another 20 minutes, and Ariane's pockets now hold about 20 items. The amount of stuff Ariane carries only bogs the game down. While trying to solve puzzles, (of which there are TONS) the game oftentimes doesn't tell you why trying to use inventory items isn't working.    This invariably leads to hours of just dragging inventory items on a puzzle hoping they will work. The game also fails to tell you why a certain puzzle needs solving in the first place. You'll spend quite a bit of time figuring out what puzzles to solve in what order. You'll spend equal amounts of time wondering how solving them will further your journey.     In a way, the puzzles here remind me of Myst. Now before you scream bloody murder, let me clarify. Myst, as many of us know, drops players in a mysterious world filled with puzzles. The element binding Myst and Journey to the Center of the Earth is the lack of prodding given players to solve these puzzles.   In Myst, this approach helped emphasize the fact you had stumbled upon the remains of ancient civilization. The clues, when provided, were integrated into the game world and added narrative drive to keep gamers glued to their seats. And most of Myst's puzzles could be solved logically, with only a few that would leave you crying for a walkthrough.   In Journey to the Center of the Earth, many of the puzzles require the combination of inventory items. Since you collect mounds of items throughout the game, this quickly turns into a chore. Many times, the items needed to solve a puzzle would never go together in real life, making item combination as surreal as the world you've stumbled upon. Thankfully, some of the puzzles don't require inventory items at all.    Instead, you'll be given tiles to place in a certain order to open a door. Or you'll be shown a handful of balls with different numbers on them and need to balance them on a scale. These puzzles highlight the better aspect of the game, as they entertain the brain without frying it.    And now a word of caution: Beware the Valley of the Spirits. Once you get there, be sure to leave the game to don two accessories: a boxing glove and some kind of head covering. Why? Simple. Here, you'll need to solve a puzzle by creating a melody. This involves walking back and forth a large area to activate columns in a specific sequence. Mess up once and the game resets the puzzle. Sure, it doesn't sound bad now. But this puzzle will make you either punch your monitor or pull your hair out, or both. It's one of the most aggravating puzzles I've ever encountered in a game.       Of course, most puzzles only supplement the overall adventure. After all, you are trying to unravel a mystery and find your way home. The story in Journey to the Center of the Earth is above-average even if it won't blow any minds. Interestingly, the motives behind the journey feel somewhat shallow. You can't help but feel that Ariane just wants to go home so she can return photographic proof of ~middle-earth~ back to the surface. Never mind that she's stumbled upon a land filled with 50-foot mushrooms and dinosaurs, she needs to run home and sell her photos!    Don't expect to run into well-written characters, either. Most of the ~middle-earth~ denizens lack any kind of emotional depth, and none of them feels genuine or memorable. To be fair, they do get ~the job~ done. And it's much better dealing with bland characters than the irritating kind.    The story is pretty linear, as in most adventure games. Late in the game, however, Journey to the Center of the Earth presents gamers with a choice. This leads to one of two endings. Unfortunately, you can't claim this choice adds much in terms of length or that it makes the game non-linear. One choice ends the game fairly quickly while the other only adds between one to two hours of play.     While on your trip through the bowels of Earth, you'll be adventuring to a collection of great tunes. The music in the game is clearly one of its strongest selling points. While not as varied as I would have liked, what's there blends well with all the game's environments and does wonders toward immersing you in the game. While we're on the sound trip, some of the characters feature nifty voiceovers, but overall the voice acting hovers just above mediocrity. Finally, many of the environmental effects, like the roar of a nearby waterfall or the sound of a creaking bridge, also help you get into the game.   When it comes to material as rich as this, the mind boggles with images of otherworldly vistas. In fantasy, it's anyone's guess what really lies at the center of the Earth. The version we see in this adventure game is only so-so. The graphics, much like everything else in the game, suffer from a total lack of ~oomph.~ Some of the scenes in the game do in fact showcase a level of imagination, but these isolated pockets of eye candy can't salvage the drab look of the game. Character animation was also kept at a minimum. Many of the people you meet either don't move very much or shuffle about like half-frozen penguins when they do. It also would have been nice to see backgrounds with more animation, and not the static ones seen here with just a hint of movement.     Overall, Journey to the center of the Earth is a decent title that keeps you gaming for cheap. It's only 20 bucks and should take the average gamer somewhere between 30 to 40 hours to finish. Just know that a third of that time may be spent in utter frustration. The game has a pretty good story and decent graphics, yet the clunky interface and unforgiving puzzles might cause some to quit before the end. I would recommend this game if you A) can't afford another adventure game or B.) don't mind spending a week of your life solving gnarly puzzles.", "date": "Mar 29, 2004"}
