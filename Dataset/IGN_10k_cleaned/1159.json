Terminus reminds me of that game in so many ways  the persistent universe, the ability to freelance, and do practically whatever you want. Terminus is on a similar scale, but it has something X didn't  multiplayer. Oh god, the multiplayer.  After playing this one, it's not surprising that it was a winner at the Independent Games Festival (an award that the box proudly sports on the back). Allow me to say, I was skeptical at first, thinking, ~What did they win an award for? Real space physics have been done before, so it can't be that.~ Read on, noble gamer, read on and find out.   The physics in this game are frustrating at first. Up until I played this game, I didn't think it was possible for a spaceship to power slide. I spent many hours getting used to matching velocities, thinking in vectors, attempting to factor in momentum, inertia, thrust, acceleration, and other similar things that you learn once in physics class and then forget over the summer. A little green dot in the center of your screen shows you what direction you're headed in, and if you turn away from that your ship continues to head towards the green dot. Useful if you're being chased  who needs rear-firing guns when you can turn around and whack somebody with your proton cannon, eh?  In the game you have ~inertial compensators~ which are easily switched on and off by the stroke of a key. These little devices make the game function like a more traditional space flight sim, that is, they keep your ship moving in the direction you're facing. When they're on, your ship will automatically adjust to whatever direction you're facing. As an example, if you do a 180, you can watch your ship's speed change to negative -- in other words, speed is always given according the direction you're facing. Doing a 180 at 11 km/sec will put you at 11 km/sec. The whole time, the little green dot moved around until it's right in front of you again. This helped make it easier to control the ship more traditionally, but there's also a physics adjusting slider to set from arcade to realistic and everything in between.  The controls were what got me confused and I'll admit, they still do. There are a lot of functions to map buttons to, and in the midst of combat or a particularly hard spy mission, I'll forget which ones do which. In addition to having the regular throttle controls, you have forward and reverse thrust, left and right thrust, and up and down thrust (you can even watch the little thrusters fire on the outside of your ship). You can also increase and decrease the amount of power to your engines, getting faster or slower acceleration and deceleration. It does get very complex very quickly, but a lot of the buttons are only required for very accurate motion.  Normally with these games I set up controls similar to TIE Fighter (or Freespace, since they're so similar) but I found a few key buttons lacking  target nearest hostile, for example, and a secondary fire button. You cycle weapons with one button, and fire with another. No guns/missiles combo setup unfortunately. A minor grievance, but a few of the good-old standby commands from the other games would have been nice. And a word of warning: the training missions assume you have your controls set to the default settings, so if you're going to customize your setup, either have a good memory, or wait until after the training missions.  The free mode is where the appeal lies. Like the manual says, there is no end to it. You complete the story mode for whatever path you choose, and then it moves on to free mode. In this mode of gameplay, you continue on your selected character path, but with no real end to the game. If you selected mercenary, you keep on truckin', taking jobs and doing good (or bad, whatever), and the solar system plods right along, without stopping. It works pretty well, but you can get bored fairly quick, unless you haven't already played X.  Where the free mode really shines is in the multiplayer mode. Imagine having 16 people in a persistent space-based universe. Think EverQuest, but with less people and a smaller world, and for free.  I haven't run into any problems thus far and while it's true I've only played multiplayer briefly, it was a good experience. The lag wasn't too bad over my 56K connection, and the people I connected to (friends of mine actually) were just as new to the game as I was. At one point, I jumped through a warp gate only to find a small convoy under attack by some pirates, and attempted to save the day. I barely succeeded, and it was really cool to be playing in a ~real~ universe with actual people.  Lastly, is the flight recorder. I remember back in the day playing TIE Fighter and watching the flight recorder, trying to get dramatic camera angles and so forth. Terminus has a full-featured movie editor, where you can splice together recordings from flight sessions, or just take one recording and output it to an AVI file for all your friends to see. ~Cool~ is a word that comes to mind, since powerslides usually look nice on replays anyhow.  The graphics are, to put it bluntly, nothing to write home about. They're less objectionable when you consider that the game has been in development for three years. To be fair, I have yet to see a game of this type impress me more than Freespace 2, and the competition in terms of graphics in this genre is rather fierce. In all fairness, the textures are very clear and the lighting is well done. Speaking of lighting, I tried adjusting the gamma, but even afterwards it was still very dark. Yes, it is outer space, so it should be dark, but if it weren't for the HUD, I'd have a hard time spotting some ships. And the cut scenes, well, the game cinematics weren't that bad, but as space sims go, it couldn't hold a candle to Freespace 2 or Starlancer.  Also, and I'm sure this is more an effect of the relative speed and physics and et cetera, but the distances in the game feel awfully misleading, and it isn't until you really understand that you're moving at 15 kilometers per second that you start realizing just how fast some things are moving. The HUD was a great help here, as it placed paths behind ships so you could see where they were headed (virtual vapor trail, pretty much), and gave you all the standard useful information about targets.  The voice acting is high quality and there are some nice quality sound effects here as well. Obviously you have the explosions and whatnot, that are rather well done (if a bit loud at default level), and the constant hum of the thrusters from you ship, while a bit grating on the nerves, are a nice added touch. The music had a bit of a Babylon 5 quality to it  ambient, with lots of synths and so forth, but it fit the game very well. No complaints there. The soundtrack disc isn't just an added bonus (it is pretty nice); it's where all the in-game music is stored, in regular old CD audio format. I assume this was done to ensure cross platform compatibility (the game is advertised as being compatible for PC, Linux and Mac), but it played havoc with Windows Autorun, loading my CD player every time I put the disc into the drive during the game, and minimizing the game window.  There are some patches out there you can grab if you're having problems, but I didn't run into many, and aside from the fact that there are a lot of buttons to remember (can't stress that enough) it's a good game. Not great, but very good, and I can certainly see why it was the winner of an Independent Games Festival.  -- Matt HanyokComment on this story", "date": "Aug 11, 2000"}
