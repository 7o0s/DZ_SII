Plus, simulations give you the ability to completely fail at whatever the task is, and try again.   SpaceStationSim (which we'll be referring to as 3S for the purposes of this review) holds an excellent premise for a simulation. You're in charge of the International Space Station, that scientific monstrosity orbiting the planet. The ISS is home to tons of experiments to see things like the effects of zero gravity on animal and plant behavior. You will get to control the crew and experiments, order your astronauts on spacewalks in case something damages the ISS, and try to keep them from going crazy in the enclosed, floating environment.    There is no question that the idea of being the head of NASA and conducting experiments in orbit definitely appeals to the space nerd in many of us. Unfortunately, 3S fails to execute enough game conventions to create software that is fun and captivating. Instead, what you basically have is a fish tank rather than an interactive game.   You won't notice the problems at first. Starting out, all you have out in space is a single habitation capsule. It's got a toilet, two beds (well, vertical sleeping bags), basic food storage, and a computer for talking to Houston. You only have a single astronaut as well, with plenty of room to expand. There is definitely promise here, almost like the first time you saw all the open land in your first SimCity plot.   There are several dozen parts you can buy for your ship, each of which comes from one of five space agencies. We all know NASA, but 3S also features the Russian counterpart (RSA), European counterpart (ESA), Japanese counterpart (JAXA), and the Canadian counterpart (CSA). You'll have to pool your resources and spend your money (called ~flags~ here) wisely at first, letting all different agencies contribute to all the parts you buy, which really does mimic how much of a collaborative effort the ISS is.    Ship parts are split into Modules and Components. Modules are like rooms, which connect to each other and serve specific purposes. Each Module can hold a number of Components, which are too numerous to mention. These run the gamut from survival-type, like refrigerators and showers, to science-type, like experimental areas for animal and plant growth. You can also throw in some emergency oxygen or water reserves, which you'll need as the station grows.   The first strike against 3S is the lack of documentation and help. A game like this is screaming for information on the Modules and Components; not just their real-life inspirations (which would have really appealed to us space nerds), but - more importantly - what they do in-game. There is a little button you can push on the shopping selection screen, but it doesn't really answer vital questions.   For that matter, the in-game tutorial is fairly worthless. It teaches you how to play, but it doesn't tell you how things work together. It's unknown if this was by design or not. As it is, the game forces you to basically feel your path along blind, trying random combinations and seeing what doesn't turn the ISS into a raging inferno. The learning curve, in short, is awfully steep; not because the game is complex, but because you really won't know what the heck is going on until you've seen the Game Over screen several times. If this was by design, it was a bad decision, especially considering the game is targeted for kids.    For example, one important Module you need to build for expansion is the support structure. These Modules are, as the game says, three-dimensional intersections that connect all the other Modules together. Most of the other Modules have only a single connection point, which means that if you forget to build those support structures, you'll quickly find yourself stuck because you'll have plugged up all the connection points. The game lacks a way to scuttle Modules, an example of something realistic (no government would just jettison a multimillion-dollar piece of equipment just because it was in the way) that really should not be in a game. This means if you make a mistake, you're screwed.   That leads us to the other major flaw of the game: the astronauts. Your astronauts can be customized, but the customization options are ridiculously lacking. Hair color, skin tone, and clothing can be adjusted, as well as some stat points like The Sims that control when they work and how much they talk to the other astronauts. While you can select which of the five agencies a given person hails from, the biographies, names and voices are pre-generated by the game. It makes no sense for a JAXA astronaut to be speaking in a Russian accent, for example. While you can go ahead and make such a combination, it detracts from any realism the game is going for.    Your astronauts basically know what's going on, and will work by their own accord to keep things moving on the ISS. They will not, however, run experiments on their own. They also have trouble taking care of themselves, which forces you to constantly micromanage their behaviors. You'll have to order them to eat and sleep as necessary, which gets extremely annoying. This wouldn't be so bad if they weren't babies, but if they stress out too much, they'll start refusing to follow orders, and eventually abandon the ISS. If any astronaut does this, you get a game over with no possibility to continue.   This will lead to many instances of failure, especially when starting out. Worse still, the game doesn't bother telling you why the astronauts abandoned ship. In one particular scenario, I was working closely with one astronaut, having him run certain experiments and making sure his moods were okay. I suddenly got the game over screen, so I loaded it up (I had only saved a couple minutes before) to figure out what happened. Turned out, the reason we lost was because the other astronaut ran out of oxygen. The reason? We had a space tourist on board who set fire to one of the devices, and the fire consumed all the oxygen in our reserves. Rather than saying we lost oxygen, the lack of it just made the other astronaut's stress level skyrocket until he got fed up and left. This produced the generic game over screen, which was no help.    In general, the game lacks feedback. It wants you to check out each astronaut, and keep tabs on his or her moods, and the levels of the ISS, and the space tourist's movements, and the experiments, and the well, you get the idea. And each of these are on their own separate screens, except for the space tourist, who only gives you alerts when he's messing with one of your machines. A lot of times, things will happen (like fires or the fact that he'll turn off oxygen generators) without you realizing it until you start getting alerts that you're low on supplies.   A given space station is limited only to a single save slot, which hurts the idea of experimenting (and amplifies the lack of feedback for failures). You have to name your save file before playing, then just repeatedly save to it. In order to make copies and experiment, you'll have to exit all the way out of the game, copy and rename your save, then load up the original again. In this era of PC gaming, this is inexcusable, and makes the game far more difficult than necessary.   Even if you plod through all this, learn the hard way how things work together, make your backups of your saves, and micromanage your astronauts, you'll find very little to keep you entertained. When you give your astronauts orders to run experiments, they do so with no special information aside from bonus money. So, in practice, running an experiment is no different than telling them to take a shower. Couldn't they have an optional mini-game or something to give us something to do while this was going on?    In all, the only thing you'll do is expand the ISS. Once you build all the parts, there's no reason to keep experimenting. There's nothing to unlock, you won't be exploring uncharted stars or doing any research that gives some sort of reward. Trying to balance your astronauts' moods will take up more time and effort than any science, which is just backwards for a game that supposedly simulates how the ISS works. Once it sinks in how little there is to actually do, the game will lose its appeal. There is no mission mode or anything like that to speak of to give it any longevity either.   Space Station Sim has horrible graphics including some seriously blocky astronauts. The camera has some movement range, but not enough, and it will take you far too many clicks and far too much time to adjust it to get the best view of any given Module, if there is one.    We won't necessarily complain about the look of Components and Modules themselves because, this being a simulation aiming for realism, the extremely function-over-form look of the devices is pretty much how things really are. The Earth, which you'll see rotating below you, is somewhat pretty, but it's by no means breathtaking. Ditto outer space, which is serviceable, but isn't anything to write home about.   The sound doesn't fare much better. There really isn't much in the way of sound effects outside the astronauts' speech, which is quite limited and rather annoying. (You will hear - more than once - an astronaut call Mission Control and say nothing more than a contented sigh after they visit the toilet.) Plus ten for effort, but minus several million for execution.   One saving grace is the Mission Control narrator, who will tell you the instant a vehicle is ready to deliver a part to your ISS, or when the internal atmosphere is having problems, or when it's low in a particular supply. He does a better job than literally any visual clues.    The music is a mixed bag. The title song is ~Mission Control~ by Julia Othmer, which is a great song to set the mood. Everything else fits the mood, even if the songs themselves are mediocre, but there is a major flaw in the game as far as the music goes. Music only plays when you zoom into a Module. When you zoom out to the full view of your ISS, the music will stop. If you zoom to the same Module, the same song will start over. If you zoom to a different Module, you'll hear a different song. This means that, in the course of the game, you'll probably hear the beginning of every song a billion times, but you'll very rarely hear any song all the way through unless you sit in one module and hit the pause button. This gets more annoying than the music itself.   The game also features movies when delivery ships, such as the NASA Shuttle or the Russian Progress Vehicle, take off to give the ISS supplies. These movies are low-res, annoying, and a little long after the first viewing; at least you can turn them off.  SpaceStationSim is yet another game on the PC that has a ton of promise and a great premise, but fails in execution and ultimately isnt worth your money. Too simple and lacking the stats for space nerds, 3S is probably better for kids. However, the steep learning curve and the general lack of feedback, especially for failures, means the game probably isnt for anyone.", "date": "Mar 20, 2007"}
