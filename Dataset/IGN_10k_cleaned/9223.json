(That's no slam on the Sims, by the way.) Mobile has become an interesting refuge for the shooter since the platform started gaining traction in 2004. I've seen some good ones like Alpha Wing 2 and some real dogs, which don't need to be mentioned.   Add Gamevil's new Omega Squadron: Annihilation 3D to the favorable column, as it offers a lot of fun within the conventions of the genre while staying within the boundaries provided by cellphone gaming itself.   You pilot the BF-604 space fighter. (The BF stands for Burning Fox. I was really pulling for Best Friends.) You essentially emit a constraint stream of death from the front of your ship, tearing through six stages of the alien menace that threatens earth. At the end of every stage, you must take down a giant boss ship.   You have a few weapons at your disposal, including two main weapons and two special attacks. You can switch between a laser and a spread shot, each growing increasingly potent as you pull in dropped power-up canisters from downed alien craft. If you choose the spread shot, you're special attack is a smart bomb that damages everything on-screen. The laser special attack is much cooler -- you get to stop time for a few seconds (slick visual effect, too) while firing on frozen enemies and plowing into now-stationary bullets to pick up extra points.   While you do have an auto-fire that keeps your cannons blazing, you can change the direction of your fire so ships don't creep up on you from the side.   The general pacing is solid. The waves of enemy craft pop out at a fair frequency so you aren't overwhelmed, but always challenged. Bigger ships fill the screen with bullet sprays you must weave through like a classic, Raiden-style shooter. The boss ships are behemoths. I found the time-bending power-up to be especially effective against these monsters, allowing me to torch their hulls with the laser while scarfing up bullets for extra points.   The general look of Omega Squadron reminds me of that tenuous period following the release of the Sega Saturn and the PlayStation where developers wanted to go polygonal, but were fighting 2D sensibilities. So, we saw a lot of side-scrolling games with 3D characters. Omega Squadron follows that formula, with dozens of polygonal ships swooping across the screen, twisting and rotating to show off their 3D structure.   I was also struck by how dreary Omega Squadron looked, but not in a bad way. The color scheme and the backdrops work in tandem to recreate that hopeless sci-fi look that works for so many anime serials. Smart color choices can really underline themes, and the whole ~earth's last hope~ gains a sense of immediacy by not filling the screen with warm tones.   The soundtrack is loaded with some very good music but minimal sound effects. The screeching alarm that warns you of an incoming boss ship is enough to make your cat openly weep, though. Yowza.Omega Squadron: Annihilation 3D was a real pleasant surprise today -- I came back to it several times throughout the day, continuously curious to see what else the game would have to offer. While this certainly doesn't shatter any mobile shooter molds, it plays well within the confinements of the platform. If you like classic top-down shoot-'em-ups, I think you'll find a real engaging challenge with Gamevil's latest.", "date": "Oct 12, 2007"}
