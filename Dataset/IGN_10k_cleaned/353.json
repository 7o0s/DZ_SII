I, for one, have never flown a F-16, driven in a Sherman tank or sat at the helm of a missile-packin' NSSN submarine, so why the hell are we reviewing products that aim to simulate them? Well, it's because we are evaluating the software for a sense of believability, a projected authentication loosely based on more ~everyday~ laws of physics, such as driving in a fast car or perhaps flying on a small shuttle flight from San Fran to L.A. Yup, it's all a guess, but keep in mind our reviews boil down to the most important consideration  how much fun is the game?   That said, the following is a review of Papyrus' NASCAR Racing 3, though I have yet to drive a genuine stock car in ~real~ life. But is the game fun? Hell, yes. Realistic? Well, I'll eat my motor oil if it's not the most authentic-feeling NASCAR game I've climbed into. So, buckle up and find out why...  NASCAR 3 allows PC gamers to race on one of twenty-eight Winston Cup and Busch tracks selected from across the U.S. Yes, that's a whopping 28 tracks, each accurately modeled to the real counterpart whether it be the Michigan Speedway, the Memphis Motorsports Park or the beloved Bristol Motor Speedway. Close to fifty drivers and their respective cars are also available with the click of the mouse so NASCAR enthusiasts can play as  or against  their favorite hero (or villain...Jeff Gordon, anyone?).  Right from the get-go there's a wealth of options given, including the choice of an arcade or simulation experience (and with adjustable variables within), the number of laps, preferred rules and ability to customize a car with the bundled paint program, to name a few features. Unlike many other racing sims, almost everything in NASCAR 3 is customizable to make the game your own.  Graphically, Papyrus out-did themselves with some of the best-looking, highly-detailed cars and tracks available in a PC simulation, not to mention extra touches to add to the realism such as translucent smoke, gratuitous tire tracks, dynamic lighting and weather effects. 3Dfx or Direct3D-compliant video cards are highly recommended for the best visual quality, and if you're PC is fast enough, the 1024 x 768 resolution is strongly suggested for colorful and crisp visuals.  The white-knuckle gameplay is so good  and challenging  it'll literally cause you to squeeze your sweaty palms around your steering wheel and clench your teeth at times. I know, I know  before I went to my first Daytona 500 race I didn't ~get~ this sport either. After all, driving around in an oval shape continuously seemed odd for a Canadian boy who was used to the track variety of Indy racing. But, as in real life, the game will teach you the skill involved in keeping that lead, when to take a pit stop and how to combat corners and opponents at the same time.  Speaking of other drivers, the A.I. in NASCAR 3 is arguably the best it's been in the series, but if real human opponents is what you want, the game supports up to twenty players simultaneously over the Net. Um, in theory, that is. Though it's quite easy to join or host an Internet or straight TCP/IP game (with the game's built-in server listings), multiplayer gameplay was unfortunately noticeably slower and choppy at times  even on a cable modem. I mean, I was able to partake in a few enjoyable races but there's little argument Papyrus needs to work on this more than any other aspect to the game. Perhaps it's patchable?   As a side-note here, the Web can also be used to trade other NASCAR 3 goodies with Sierra's proprietary WONswap [https://wonswap.won.net/nascar3], a data file transferring utility which takes files that users have created (maps, models, spray paints) and uploads them to a database to share and distribute.   Along with the laggy multiplayer play, there's only one other small beef with the game. While the replay mode is robust and allows players to watch all races (even incomplete ones) from many different angles (even highlighting other drivers), you can't switch views during the race itself. That is, you are stuck with the in-car view, unless you want to hit the F10 key for a third-person view of the action. Look, I know this ain't Need for Speed but I often enjoy an asphalt cam or bumper mode to get the most out of the visuals. Would it have been so hard to through in all the views in a key that cycles through them all?  Even with these minor shortcomings, NASCAR 3 is hands-down the best American stock car racing simulation on the planet. There are other noteworthy features worth mentioning  such as support for positional 3D audio hardware and incredibly realistic force-feedback  all of which add to the overall immersion factor. Yes, it's true that I've never driver in a NASCAR tournament and no, I haven't even lapped a track in a stock car. But I'll be darned if NASCAR 3 isn't the closest I'll ever get to the real thing...  -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Oct 27, 1999"}
