The team responsible for that Game Boy Color movie translation is at it again with The Mummy, a great action/platform/puzzle game that brings back the design of Konami NES classics The Goonies and Castlevania. If you loved Konami for its heavily focused gameplay during the 8-bit Nintendo days, then you're going to find lots to like with this movie licensed game  love or hate the 1999 film. Features Control three characters More than a dozen levels Password save Only for Game Boy Color  As a punishment for killing the Pharaoh Seti as well as sleeping with his mistress, an Egyptian priest was mummified alive with a curse. In 1923 treasure hunters inadvertently resurrect him, and he must be stopped before he can wreak vengeance on the world. So is the story of The Mummy, a remake of the classic Universal film starring Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell. The Game Boy Color version of the game follows the plot of the film as closely as possible, as not only do you take control of Rick, but also Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and Jonathon (John Hannah) in this action game that's heavy in puzzle solving.   The game begins with you in control of Evelyn -- you'll have to wander the library to acquire books as well as befriend Jonathon. As Evelyn, you can run, jump, and climb ladders, as well as utilize ruins to unlock certain doors to gain access to other rooms. In the next level, you take control of Jonathon, who can't run or jump as far as Evelyn, but he can pick up stones and plant dynamite, as well as punch enemy characters. By the time you catch up with Rick (who wields a set of guns and can pick up a sniper rifle to hit switches from afar), you'll have the full set that'll take you deep into the Mummy's tomb.  Designed by Konami's Nagoya team, the same group responsible for the excellent Game Boy Color version of The Grinch, The Mummy is great old-school fun. It's not an easy game  some levels can take you several tries and a few hours to figure out the puzzle required to get you to the next part of the level. It's all about learning each character's strengths and weaknesses, as several levels will require you to continuously switch between the three in order to get through the level. The game isn't realistic by any stretch of the imagination -- rooms in the levels will cycle from top to bottom and back again (similar to Bubble Bobble), and some puzzles require you to push dim-witted guards off platforms (offering zero resistance in the process). But though it lacks in realism, it makes up for it in excellent game design and level layout  the game feels like a classic NES game. It even has the feeling of Castlevania in some spots, and it makes you wonder  why don't these guys just cut to the chase and give us Castlevania?  Even the graphics look ripped out of the NES days. That's not a bad thing, since it does give The Mummy much of its charm, and it makes it a little easier to turn on the ~suspension of disbelief~ switch in your mind when it comes to the unrealistic nature of some of the gameplay elements. But while the in-game graphics have a last-generation feel, the cutscenes are detailed digitized scenes from the flick (with Brendan Fraser obviously not handing over his facial likeness for some reason).  My big complaint is in the fact that some levels are just too intimidating. It takes a bit of trial and  error to figure out which character you'll need for a specific spot in a level. And if you screw up (run out of ammunition or use a tablet in the wrong spot), you can't reset the level with a simple command  you have to power off the system and turn it back on again. The game does feature a four character password system to save your position  and in this case I'm not complaining about the lack of battery, since there's nothing the password needs to record other than which level you've reached.  I didn't really care for the movie  too silly and unbalanced for my tastes. But this game is great  it's challenging, it's well-designed, and it feels like a classic NES game. Konami should continue using its Nagoya studios for its GBC development...The Grinch was fabulous, and The Mummy's great. These guys really know how to make an 8-bit game shine on the handheld.", "date": "Dec 20, 2000"}
