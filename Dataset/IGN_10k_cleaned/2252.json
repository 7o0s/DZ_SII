His legacy is universally appealing, spanning more than 30-plus years of books and movies, and most recently, he's starred in videogames. In game, his beginnings have been, shall eye say, golden?    After three mediocre Bond games on PlayStation (two first-person shooters and one action-racer), Electronic Arts has taken Bond to the next step in James Bond 007 in...Agent Under Fire, a hybrid title that's predominantly a first-person shooter, but also highlights substantial car-racing levels, rail-shooter missions, and for those who like tanks, a tank mission.  Agent Under Fire is by far EA's best effort yet with its pricey Bond license, as it makes its debut on PlayStation 2. Given that the first three titles were utterly forgettable, saying that it's best yet must be kept in context. When Agent Under Fire isn't busy being the most obviously, plainly, and unimaginatively designed first-person shooter on the planet, the game is sharp looking, boasts respectable voice-acting, and offers a spankingly fun multiplayer mode. It's worth taking a look at if you're a Bond fan, but if you have an eye for first-person shooters, don't bother. It's kids play.   Gameplay EA decided to switch things up with Agent Under Fire, a Bond game not based on, or tied into, any particular MGM movie by the same name. With free reign over its destiny, EA's choice of levels and characters is remarkably germane, meaning that every character you meet and each level you play through seems uncannily familiar, as if you might have seen them in any one of the Bond movies at one time or another. It's as if EA based the game on several Bond movies, and tied them all into one.   Let's start with the single-player game. The basic story is classic international espionage, and frankly, there's really not much to tell -- A big corporation is getting out of hand, has stolen data that enables it to clone people, and it plans on taking over the world. Bond, naturally, has to stop it all nearly single-handedly, with the minor help of Q, M, and Zoe Nightshade, a sexy vixen of a secret agent whose shapely body has polygons in all the right places.   Like I said, the story is mostly a vehicle for the action (just like in any Bond film), meaning that it's guaranteed to keep you from thinking much. Unfortunately, the game itself won't make you think much either. Agent Under Fire, as a first-person shooter, is a remarkably sleepy number. After having played every first-person shooter on PlayStation 2 and having broken some blood vessels with PC first-person shooters in late night events, I can honestly say that Agent Under Fire is an entirely rinky-dink affair. Its simplistic, by-the-numbers gameplay is painful to endure after a good bout with Half-Life or Red Faction on PS2, and that's unfortunate.   But it's not like EA did a horrible job. The game is substantial as an overall action game, and it's unusual for a solid first-person shooter to offer driving and rail-style levels that are so good. It's just that the FPS genre has come so far in the last two-plus years, with games such as Half-Life, Deus Ex, or even No One Lives Forever just to name a few, that Agent Under Fire seems like kindling next to a Redwood tree, Mini-Me next to a Shaquille O'Neal, a MacDonald's cheese burger next to an In-'N-Out Double-Double, Animal Style. Agent Under Fire just isn't even in the same league.   The FPS levels are objective-based, and the missions often change or increase, with M connecting via intercom to Bond during the introductions or during the game itself. What's best about the levels is that they definitely progress more along the lines of Goldeneye than Tomorrow Never Dies. In other words, one gets a better sense of being a Bond spy than in EA's previous games, but they're still very ordinary and linear in design. Agent Under Fire spans a mild 12 levels and requires about 10-12 hours to beat on medium difficulty level, and features a surprisingly fun and deep multiplayer game (which requires a Multitap for four players).    One of the levels (Cold Reception) finds Bond infiltrating an Embassy, and it's extremely evident he's meant to use stealth to achieve his goals, jumping trip wires, sneaking around quietly, using a dart gun, waiting for the right moment, etc. It's good stuff, but for anyone who's played a decent console FPS, such as Goldeneye (summer 1997) or even Medal of Honor, this is incredibly old, dated, been-there-done-that design.    In other missions, such as and Fire and Water or Poseidon, an adequate mixture of blasting, dodging, and the right selection of weapons is required to succeed. These are probably the most balanced and challenging levels. But even in these, what struck me as so rudimentary and basic is the way everything was explained. Almost every gadget is so obvious it's hardly fun to use. Spies are smart, they know what gadgets do, and the game should make me feel smart, not like a first-grader. Each objective is so painstakingly pointed out in cut-scenes or elsewhere, that the most clumsy of newbies instantly would know what to do. EA's designers were so very keen on pointing out all of the cool spy stuff that any fun in ~discovering~ what to do is instantly wiped out.   After playing a game such as Half-Life, it's clear that the designers at EA created Agent Under Fire with an exterior mindset, not an interior one. I'll explain. Instead of creating a level that's packed with hidden areas and secret hallways that engage the player in exploring and experimenting as a core function of the game, Agent Under Fire feels like it was designed very linearly, very simplisticly, with a very basic structure, and then as a kind of exterior, frosting, extra little Bond Moves were added to complement it. I don't know for sure how the creators actually went about making it, but that's the way it feels and plays; that's the end result. The few exceptions are Fire and Water and Cold Reception, where levels were more elegantly designed. Naturally, there are secret areas I did miss that I saw in the final video, but I didn't miss many, and those I missed, well, I don't miss that much.    For example, in Mediterranean Crisis, Bond and Zoe end up in jail cells on a freighter, almost exactly like Bond and Natalia did in Goldeneye in one of the Bunker levels. While in Goldeneye, Bond had to use his magnetic watch to snag the jail cell keys, while the guard wasn't watching, in Agent Under Fire, Bond must use his laser watch to unlock his jail cell door. But the level is so obviously similar, and so much less surprising that it's clear what to do from the instant the cut-scene finishes. What's more, the guard just walks right by, unsuspecting, when I laser blast the cell lock. I broke out right in front of him! And then just instantly kicked his butt and stole his gun! Where's the skill or timing in that?   There are dozens of other examples  the names of all the gadgets are all Q-this and Q-that. Q-me when it's time to wake up. Must I use the Q-laser, the Q-specs, or the Q-Decoder? Can I go the Q-bathroom? I get it already! It's a Q gadget  heck, most people already know it's a gadget, probably made by Q, so does he have to stamp a patent on everything?   Then there's the Q-Claw, which enables Bond to swing on to high perches, and also functions in an entirely dumb fashion. All you have to do is look for the big, obvious, white, circular surfaces, which usually look entirely out of place, and it's patently clear you can swing up there.  So, naturally, EA's game is designed for people to get through them, but it just went too far with the obvious stuff. When it's not the names of the gadgets, it's the complete simplicity of the levels that will turn off all mental processes and inevitably make you wish you were playing something else.   But let's move on, shall we? My point has been made. It should be noted that the game's pure driving levels, Dangerous Pursuit and Streets of Bucharest, are totally awesome. Not only do you get the chance to drive in the Astin Martin DB5 and the BMW Zed 8, but each one is loaded with the classic Bond weapons and high-tech gadgetry.   In Streets of Bucharest, I had the most fun just driving around and feeling the exquisite arcade-style car physics, shocks, and grip. The car drives with a firm grip on the road, with excellent acceleration, and there's an awesome, awesome E-break function that enables some of the finest 180s and powerslides this side of Daytona USA. The driving levels in this game are worth checking out all alone. And if that weren't enough, the open, free roads, packed with items and secret jumps and alleyways, are big and plentiful.   As far as weapons and gadgets go, the list is meaty. The game includes a Wolfram P2K, Windsor Viper, IAC Defender, Dartgun, The Golden Gun (which only knocks out enemies with one in Multiplayer), Koffler and Stock KS7, Ingalls Type 20, Calypso P-750, Munitions Belgique PS100, Kazakovich KA-57, Windsor FSU-4, Meyer Westlicher UGW, Koffler and Stock D17, Frinesi Special 12, SWZ SSR4000, Grenades, MRL-22, and even more guns in Multiplayer. The gadget list features the Q-Decryptor, Q-Claw, Q-laser, Q-Specs, Q-Camera, Q-Remote, Q-Card, and the Q-Jet, a short-burst jetpack.    The only other thing I need to harp on are the control setups. There are nearly enough of them, but I wanted this simple set-up: L1 is jump, L2 is crouch; R1 is primary fire, R2 is secondary fire; X is action, and the dpad is used for toggling through weapons; L3 is move, strafe, etc, R3 is for looking around. Boom. Make L1 jump, not triangle! A couple of settings were close (Setting 2 and 3), but they weren't exact. A few more control setups would have been nice. And for those who want to know, there is no keyboard and mouse support.   Last, but by no means least, is the glorious Multiplayer mode. Following the tradition set before it, Agent Under Fire, as far as four-player console games are concerned, is a rollicking good multiplayer game. It retains some of the best qualities of Goldeneye, but it betters Goldeneye by maintaining a relatively solid 30-fps framerate.   The set-ups are vast, and the menus are quick and reasonably detailed (my only complaint is that players cannot see which setup is which). Like I said, the framerate is set for a relatively solid 30 fps (whereas the single-player game is pretty much set at 60 fps), and the levels are varied and pose different kinds of challenges.   Thanks to the huge weapon (18-plus weapons) and character selection (10-plus) set that EA included, players can mix match weapons and power-ups at will, and use cool little extras, such as Bionics, cloak, and rechargeable jetpacks. They add a nice bit of depth. Naturally, the four-player game gets a little too popcorn-ish with the auto-aim Photon Cannon and the Bazooka, but with a good blend of handguns, automatics, this is a great party game. The weapons are balanced, and the level design here is all quite good, too.  Players can select from five mini-games in Multiplayer mode, and naturally in my humble opinion, Combat Training (Deathmatch) is the most fun. Protect the Flag, Golden Gun, Anti-Terrorist Training, and Top Agent are also available, and in most of these games, players can team up on in color-coordinated squads if they choose. Even though I felt the single-player mode was under-whelming, the Multiplayer mode was a definite surprise. As far as multiplayer games on PS2 go, this is certainly a top choice.    Graphics While it appears that games on the Xbox and GameCube are having their own problems with aliasing and flickering (yes, it's true), and the heat has been taken off the PS2 for now, Agent Under Fire does show off a mixture of great graphics, occasionally flawed by aliasing and flickering. It's noticeable but not bothersome, and the game's good looks outweigh its weaknesses.  While the levels are huge and lots of polygons fill the screen, as most PS2 games are these days, the textures show off nicely, and the framerate, like I said before, is high. The lighting effects are well worth noting, and so are the explosions. Overall, each level features beautiful lighting, a good sense of color -- the levels are not too bright, not too dark -- and extremely detailed in-game cutscenes that help to tell the story.   But what's best about Agent Under Fire is the character design. Bond looks like an amalgam of Pierce Brosnan, Timothy Dalton and Roger Moore, in other words, he's perfect looking. The character designers display a keen sense of detail in clothing, body shape, and facial detail that's rarely been seen in games to date.   Bond and other characters in the game show off several facial expressions that are some the best I've seen in a game, with great work done in the department of eyes movement and textures, facial textures, and the difficult ability to make good looking characters. Zoe and several other female characters in the game are righteously built, with um, perfect bodies and stunning, erm, female features...   Sound The sound department here is very mixed. On the one hand, the voice acting is the best it's been in a Bond game, and on the other hand, there's the music.   EA secured the classic Bond theme song, and just like TWINE, the theme is used often...very often. Only here, after playing through the entirety of the game, you'll never want to hear the theme song ever, ever again. EA has made certain you won't forget the Bond theme song by pummeling you over the head every chance it gets with the first riff of the song (~DUH DUH, duhnnn, Duh duh duh duh...~ Every time you get a Bond point or pretty much do anything in the game, you get smacked with (~DUH DUH, duhnnn, Duh duh duh duh...~ It's like instead of being rewarded, you get (~DUH DUH, duhnnn, Duh duh duh duh...~, and frankly, the cheesiness of this overused sound clip is so ripe and so smelly it not only hurts you ears, it hurts your nose, too.   As for the voice acting, it's great. These are totally believable voice actors. The voices are generally well synched with the characters mouths, and even though the voices of Pierce Brosnan (Bond), John Cleese (Q), and Judy Dench (M) weren't used in the game, the voice actors who imitate them are incredibly convincing. M's voice is particularly superb. James Bond in...Agent Under Fire is a big mixed bag of the good, bad, and the cheesy. The single-player game leaves much to be desired as a first-person shooter. It's simplistic and overly explained, and it displays much of the levels design that was swell about three or four years ago, you know, exploding barrels, bullet holes in the walls, the occasional secret door, etc. It does nothing to move the genre forward, and in most cases, it's not as sophisticated as Goldeneye was four years ago. On the other hand, the overall experience of Agent Under Fire is strangely good. Despite the loathing that the single-player experience drudges up in me, the driving levels are particularly satisfying, and the rail-based shooter levels add a nice bit of depth, too. And then there is the four-person Multiplayer mode, which is spot-on with a good framerate, lots of well-designed levels, and great weapons and gadgets. So, as usual, I have mixed feelings about good old Bond. On the one hand, Agent Under Fire will totally alienate hardcore first-person shooter fans with its kindergarten-style level design, but on the other hand, the overall experience comes together as a respectable whole. It's difficult to recommend Agent Under Fire as a FPS alone, but as thorough action game, it's got something going on. My suggestion? If you liked Goldeneye and you've been waiting for the next great Bond game, this is the closest EA has come yet to restoring the Bond name to greatness in a videogame, but it's not ~the one.~ It might keep you warmed over until something better comes along, and in the meantime it's a great multiplayer game.", "date": "Nov 13, 2001"}
