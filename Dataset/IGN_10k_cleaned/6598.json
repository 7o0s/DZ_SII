The Need For Speed adds high performance street cars and open road racing to the usual racing formula (no pun intended), which adds a nice twist. Add to that some spectacular backgrounds and you've got yourself a swell little game.  The choice of cars is impressive, to say the least. Pick from this list: Dodge Viper, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porshe, Corvette, Mazda RX7, Toyota Supra Turbo, or Acura NSX. Next, pick your track. There're six of the, three being open road. You can also choose what time of the day you want to race. With all of these options, it's rarely the same game twice.  The graphics are gorgeous, with hardly any draw-in at all. However, you never really get that feeling of speed, like in Ridge Racer, and there're no power slides either. The Need For Speed isn't the best racer out there, but offers a nice change from the norm.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
