Whether you think it's real or staged (here's a hint: it's fake), to insist a ~realistic~ professional wrestling game is almost contradicting the whole sport. That's the direction professional wrestling videogames have taken, at least on the console side of things; mimicking the ~action~ that occurs in the ring during the Raw or Smackdown weekly events...keeping them as ~real~ as possible. Bandai says ~nuts to that!~ with its release of Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy, a wrestling game based upon the anime series currently airing on Fox Kids on its Saturday morning line-up. There's nothing realistic in this game; in fact, the designers have made the effort to go as over the top both in the action as well as the characters that fight in the Ultimate Muscle ring. But that's its charm, and what's more, the designers built a really cool, non-buttonmashing wrestling game engine for Ultimate Muscle to make things more intuitive and less random. The game lacks a few features beyond the standard one-on-one matches, but there's enough variety in the different character styles of all the Ultimate Muscle members to keep players interested. Features 23 different wrestlers Story, survival, 3 vs. 3, and Training modes Character directory Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (one slot) Only for Game Boy Advance Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy puts players in a one-on-one fight against a wide range of 23 different, shall we say ~out of this world~ opponents. The meat to the game is in its Story mode, where players work their way through Kid Muscle's wrestling career. He's apparently a reluctant wrestler and super lazy, at least that's the impression given in the game's extensive cutscenes that unfold between rounds. In the Story mode, players learn about the dMp and Kid's father, King Muscle...as well as meet some of the craziest wrestlers you've ever seen: The human walrus Wally Tusket, a fighting set of road signs (Road Rage), and a giant cellphone round out the cast. But the story unfolds only if Kid wins the wrestling bouts...and players certainly aren't going to do that without heading into the extremely helpful training mode to learn the nuances of this game's wrestling engine.  This is not a button masher. At all. Every move must be pulled off with precise timing, and the designers of the game clearly show the prime moment to pull off every move and counter with a powerbar on the side of the screen. When players grapple, the bar will show up and a cursor will quickly move across it. Moves are only pulled off successfully if the button's pressed when the cursor's in the Blue area of the bar; timing is absolutely critical. If the button's pressed at the wrong time, the cursor will reset and start moving again...but only if the opponent hasn't countered the move with his own timing bar. Unlike the ~rules~ of wrestling, there are no pin victories; the idea is to whittle the opponent's power down to the red zone, and pull off a Super Move that will knock him out cold. That's when fights are won.   Players will have to put to use what's called Friendship powers in order to pull this off, and it's these moves where the more insane over the top action comes out. As players fight, a power bar builds; when it reaches a certain point, the fighter can pull off a Friendship move that will make it easier for him to pull off the powerful finishers, either by making him remain stunned for a longer period of time, or making the ~blue~ area of the timing bar much easier to hit. Opponents can counter Friendships with their own Friendship, but only if they have enough earned in the power bar. Fights can be won without using Friendships, but these make the fights much quicker and intense.  As fun as this game is, it's not the greatest GBA development. The animation takes a bit of a downturn, as many of the wrestling moves in this game are simply rendered as two frames motions from start to finish. But considering that the character sprites are significantly sized on the GBA screen, and that most of the  23 different characters have their own design and don't share art assets (read: no palette-swapping cheats), the limited animation, though awkward, is not terrible to watch since it really doesn't hurt the action. There are definitely places where the designers could have added a bit more over-the-top flair, since many of the superduper finishing moves connect with an unimpressive finale that certainly could have been spiced up with more exaggerated motions.  The game also doesn't feature any out-of-the-ring action...every second of the fight takes place within the ring itself. Since the game doesn't depend on pinning the opponent, players can't break out of a pin at the last minute to keep the game alive; once that super move is pulled off during the victim's red zone, the match is over. And though there are several modes of play, they're all based around the same exact one-on-one game design...no tag teams, and no four-player fights. At least it supports the link cable in Vs. Mode and 3 on 3 mode; it's a really great two player game, but you'll need an extra copy of the cartridge to take advantage of it. For what the game is, Ultimate Muscle: The Kinnikuman Legacy is a surprisingly fun Game Boy Advance title that has a really good wrestling engine foundation. The move from button mashing to exclusive timing makes the game more approachable and gets rid of that ~how the hell did you counter my move?~ gameplay element; it's more cut and dry with the timing bar. Bandai could definitely take what they've created with Ultimate Muscle and build upon it for another wrestling game with more gameplay features, but as is, the company's first GBA wrestler is definitely worth a look...even if you're not into the anime series. And any game that lets you poot gas as a taunt and an attack, or play as a half-walrus or a set of street signs is A-OK in my book.", "date": "Jun 3, 2003"}
