But times have changed and many a video game score has risen to the levels of their silver screen brethren, some even eclipsing them in the process. Amon Tobin's score for Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is just one shining example, perhaps the shiniest to date, even.    Tobin, who is known throughout the world for his dense electronic compositions, approached this, his first bona fide soundtrack endeavor, just as he would if it had been for a major motion picture. Taking his cues from the likes of John Barry (the man responsible for the enduring James Bond theme) and Goblin (the Italian group who scored many of Dario Argento's classic horror films), Tobin has crafted a completely immersive aural environment that works as a separate entity from the game.    Enlisting the services of an international cast of musicians, many of whom have strong soundtrack composition backgrounds including Nacho Mendez, as well several other international musicians of note (Eiji Myaki, and Massimo Modugno and Umberto Modugno), Tobin's score for the game is a rich sonic experience that will take the listener through a variety of dreamlike (and in many cases nightmarish) ambient tonescapes. Lest you get the impression that this is a cold tempered blast of electronic calibration, Tobin has generously laced his compositions with the rich textures of the Hammond B3 (courtesy of Massimo Modugno), the bass (from Nacho Mendez), flute (thanks to Eiji Myake), Mellotron (Umberto Modugno), not to mention piano, percussion, drums, guitar, as well as a full string section and the Kayaguchiko National Junior Choir. The result is a fully realized composition broken up into 10 distinct movements.   ~The Lighthouse~ sets the tone as the live instruments get the stop-n-go stutter treatment from Tobin, the rhythms colliding, lurching, and jogging throughout the catchily chaotic mini-maelstrom of sound. The shift into ~Ruthless~ is a seamless one, however this track takes on a much more ominous, albeit minimalist, tone, favoring washed out ambiance and Omenesque bells before it unleashes a throbbing chug and careening rhythmic flash bang. While the track is beefed up on the BPM side of things (182 vs. the previous tune's 140) it seems slower and more turgid, perhaps a result of the compressed drums and overall claustrophobic accentuation.    The immersive sense of density continues on ~Theme From Battery,~ which tones the BPMs down considerably and makes use of a heavily treated string section, all of which results in a slow burn intensity that doesn't so much build as it smolders quietly and persistently. ~Kokubo Sosho Stealth,~ as the name readily applies, utilizes a lot of Asian influences, from atonal splashes to fluttering flute that floats eerily in the background. The track picks up, in terms of intensity, laying down a subdued, yet ominous expanse of sound that unravels like a thick sheet of viscous fog. The haunting mock taiko drum effects only add to the ambiance.    Tobin is nothing if not adventurous and he takes a decidedly different tact on ~El Cargo,~ the track on the entire album that most resembles the work of the Italian prog/art quartet Goblin. Best known for their scoring work on many of Dario Argento's high profile horror thrillers, the group took the nail biting stylistics of Bernard Herrmann as a blueprint, and then veered off into theatric rock terrain. Tobin does a similar dance here, using languid guitar to instill a sense of funky rhythm and false ease, all of which blends into an increasingly propulsive build of throbbing percussion. The barely audible voices that churn hypnotically in the undercurrent add an additional layer of depth and despair to the whole affair.      With ~Displaced~ Tobin again returns to a mutated sonic spectrum, the drums compressed to the point of being more akin to the sound of a rubber mallet pounding ever so gently on a hollow wooden floor. Coupled with the flange induced guitar and ecclesiastical surges of organ, not to mention some string plucking intonations, the overall effect is one that is somewhat dizzying, like being deprived of oxygen while standing underneath a running shower head. Like many of the previous tracks, it works on a slow burn, creepily intense build, however this time it shifts seamlessly into an up-tempo syncopated rhythm blurt that takes it into almost pseudo techno terrain. And while that might have been enough for the average composer, Tobin continues to tweak our expectations by adding in mildly chaotic din, building the movement to a peaking crescendo that is finally augmented by a melee of all the instruments combined before it drifts off into a revelatory expanse of semi-white noize.    The ~Ruthless (Reprise)~ returns to Italian horror score territory, thanks to echo reverb waver (actually it's Lesley cabinet emulation applied to the strings and guitar) that sounds not unlike an underwater symphonic excursion. The liquidic splashes quickly give way to a much more intrusive, almost digging sensation that immediately sets you on edge before it dissipates into empty noize and then returns to the wavering guitar flutter. And while ~Kokubo Sosho Battle~ sounds like something ripped from a lost Flaming Lips album, it's really just an amped up extrapolation of what Tobin explored earlier on ~Kokubo Sosho Stealth,~ albeit this time infused with a much more militaristic cadence so as to imply a bloody and brutal altercation.    The final two tracks on the album, ~Hokkaido~ and ~The Clean Up~ fit nicely into the fold. The former again sees Tobin and company exploring a decidedly Eastern sense of tone and space, this time focusing on washes of synth integrated with swelling, melancholic strings, the two apposing forces giving way to cricket chirping electronic embellishment and saber clashing rhythms. The latter is a fitting enough title for the closing song on an album of this nature. The song itself is perhaps the most detached of the lot, spending the early portions of its 7-minute length wallowing around in the empty expanse of hollow noize, bits of flute, guitar, strings, and cymbals floating with deceptive aimlessness, crashing into one another to create a sense of controlled din. The drums eventually kick in with a rapid jazz groove, making it a somewhat freeform bit of extraterrestrial improv jazz.    With Chaos Theory Tobin has achieved what few soundtracks ever accomplish. He has managed to make a musical entity that not only meshes well with its companion piece, in this case the video game, but one that also stands alone, a fully realized composition that can be enjoyed regardless of your gaming status.", "date": "Feb 1, 2005"}
