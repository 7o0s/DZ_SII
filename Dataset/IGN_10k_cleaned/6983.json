Weeks after the PlayStation Portable gets a $40 edition of the classic PC puzzle game Lemmings, cell phones receive an equally entertaining version of the venerable favorite. Ah, mobile -- it's not just about fun, it's about value. And if you're a fan of the franchise, you get a healthy dose of both in the mobile edition.   For the uninitiated -- and with all the editions of this game floating around the pixelspace, I cannot imagine there are many -- Lemmings is a riff on the Disney-fueled myth that there is a tiny species of mammal that is so dumb, it commits suicide by throwing itself off a cliff. Each stage in Lemmings has an entrance where the creatures pour into the screen and an exit they have to somehow reach without perishing. The Lemmings don't provide any help on their own -- they just walk in a straight line until they either bump into something and turn around or fall off a high ledge to their deaths.   It's up to you, the deity in this day-glo microcosm, to assign special jobs to the Lemmings to increase their chances of survival. You can tell Lemmings to stop and hold up traffic, mine through floors, bash through walls, unfold umbrellas for a gentle landing, and more. The secret to success is surveying the level, assembling a game plan, and then assigning jobs in real-time to minimize the number of casualties. On some levels, you can have a 100-percent survival rate. However, there will be occasions where some of the Lemmings just have to take one for the team. And, honestly, that's kinda where the sick fun kicks in. You can sentence the Lemmings to death en masse, and there is a certain amusement in watching these buggers flare up in a group instance of spontaneous internal combustion.   In the event you screw up, you can always reset a puzzle and try again. And here's where Lemmings works so well for mobile. These puzzles don't take very long to complete, so even if you do need to wipe the slate, you're not out a lot of invested time. This is important for puzzlers, since mobile gaming is the entertainment medium of stolen moments (you cannot imagine how many beep-boops these trained ears hear in public restrooms).   For purists, there are a few cut corners in the mobile version that may irk your nostalgic sensibilities. For one thing, the control is a little slow. And the number of Lemmings in each level has been downsized to only 25. However, the fewer Lemmings does make things much more manageable on the smaller screen, and that's a huge plus. If the original 100 were walking around all nimbly-bimbly-like, it would just be too confusing.   The game looks pretty much like the original inspiration, down to the green tufts of hair on these marching mammals. The levels aren't as detailed as you've seen in other versions (the PSP edition is admittedly quite pretty), but that doesn't make them any less playable. And the sound effects, so important for the complete Lemmings experience, are indeed in place.  Lemmings is a classic puzzler done right on mobile. It makes the necessary changes appropriate for the hosting platform, but none of the game play is sacrificed. The slow control occasionally bothered me, but when you figure out the proper formula for finishing a level and know exactly where to go and what to click, it's not so bad. There's a chance you suffer from Lemmings fatigue, but if not, this is a solid rendition of the game for the right price.", "date": "Jun 12, 2006"}
