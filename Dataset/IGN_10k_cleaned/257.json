Since that time, the industry has grown exponentially, feeding on itself over the years by retooling the titles of the golden age of videogaming and releasing them again and again in a thousand unrecognizable forms. Now it seems that there is a deep thirst in the PC gaming collective unconscious to return to the games that started it all. Hasbro is releasing new versions of Pong and Missile Command. Intellivision Productions Inc. has appeared out of nowhere and released a compilation of early titles for the system of the same name. And finally, Jordan Mechner has returned to retool his original masterpiece, an event that, at least for the geekiest of us, is akin to the Second Coming.   Prince of Persia 3D makes a half-hearted attempt (in the first pages of the manual) to carry on the storyline that started with Prince of Persia all those years ago. As the game begins, you (now a true prince) are invited to a banquet featuring some pretty risqu (okay, risqu for 12th century Persia) entertainment. During the course of the meal the dancer goes crazy with the knives and rapidly wipes out the guard sent to protect you and the king. Helpless, you are dragged off to a dark dungeon and chucked into a cell without and weapons or equipment. From here, you must escape your prison, stop the plans of the evil vizier and reunite yourself with your new bride. As with the original game, every so often cutscenes pop up to let you in on what's happening elsewhere as you continue your escape. While I found the tale to be well written, the story didn't really offer much except an explanation as to why you were back in the damn dungeon again and a reason for you to bother with getting back out. Still, the cutscenes (although a trifle skimpy) worked well as a carrot to keep me wanting to make it just a little bit further into the game.  What's really impressive about Prince of Persia 3D (or distressing, if you weren't a fan of the original) is how the Red Orb design team have managed to bring so old a game into the third dimension without changing the feel of the gameplay at all. In many ways identical to the original release, Prince of Persia 3D is a classic platform game that has you jumping over pits, grabbing onto ledges and dodging insidious traps through 15 long levels. Unlike the first game, all of the movement options available to you are a lot more precise in their function and veteran players will be happy to note that their character will jump exactly when they hit the jump key rather than hurtling over the edge of a deep pit. One new feature that was added was swimming, which I liked but found limited in its presentation. In one very large room that was filled with water, I hit an invisible barrier when I tried to swim too far in one direction. While I understand the need to keep players from avoiding important game elements, it should be done in a manner that doesn't disturb the suspension of disbelief. If they wanted to keep me from going in that direction, they might have provided a reason in the form of dangerous currents, deadly sea life, spiked traps or a conveniently placed wall. Overall though, all of the motion options available in the original game are here as well and work faster smarter and better than they did the first time around.  Another area that has been improved (although less than you might imagine) is combat. The original game offered the player only a couple of options. Once you drew your sword, you could shuffle forward, shuffle backwards or block your opponent's attack. While there's no doubt that the fighting system in Prince 3D is more advanced, it's only more advanced because of the addition of the third dimension. Once your sword is drawn you have the ability to shuffle in any direction (although you will always, for the most part, face the same direction), strike to the left, strike to the right, strike overhead, and block your opponent's attack. While there is a new feint option that allows you to fake an attack in a certain direction, I didn't use it a lot as it just seemed to get me killed. Even with this somewhat limited approach to combat though, fighting in Prince of Persia is still a lot of fun. First off, you've got more weapons this time around. In addition to your trusty sword, you'll get access to a bow, a staff and dual assassin's blades during the course of the game. Better still, you can also find shrines that can give your arrows different magical powers. While I was a little surprised that the design team didn't do more with the combat system, the fact is that Prince of Persia was never about combat  it's about puzzle solving and, if possible, avoiding the enemy altogether.  Which brings us to the meat of Prince 3D  puzzles. From the first seconds of the game, you'll have to push and pull crates, hit secret levers, unlock treasure chests, avoid traps, and most of all, not get lost. While most of the puzzles were fairly intuitive, I found the difficulty level set way too high for the first few levels of the game. The fact is, unless you're very, very good at problem solving (and orienteering  I was lost for most of the game) or very, very patient, you're probably going to get pretty pissed off at this game within the first hour after opening it. The real test of whether or not Prince of Persia 3D is a good type of game for you is whether you're the type of person who throws down the controller and comes back later or whether you're the type of player who throws down the controller and deletes a game from your system. The good news is, the very challenge of the game gave me a thrill I haven't experienced in years. This difficulty (and accompanying thrill) should come as no surprise to veteran gamers. The original Prince of Persia was a damn difficult game to beat and Prince of Persia 3D stays true to the formula.  Perhaps the biggest changes in Prince of Persia 3D were in the graphics and sound. While it may seem that the move to 3D would be the most noticeable change, it's really the textures and lighting that are the big eye grabbers. The team has also stayed true to the feel of the original title by offering up amazingly smooth animation sequences for the Prince and all of the other characters in the game. The game's soundtrack is equally impressive serving up a beautiful Middle Eastern meets Drum and Bass soundtrack that changes from level to level. While I had no actual problems with the sound effects and voice acting that was included, there didn't seem to be very much of it, and because of that I never really identified with my character all that much. Perhaps Mechner was uncomfortable with adding vocals to a character who has been mute for so long.  In the end, Prince of Persia 3D does exactly what it promised it would do  it brings Prince of Persia up to date. The problem is, games have changed so much in the past fifteen years that many of today's players may not appreciate the amazing difficulty and straightforward nature of the end result. If you're looking for an hardcore action game or you're looking for a console-style platform adventure, you should leave this one on the shelf and keep walking. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a very challenging adventure game that will keep you occupied (and perhaps frustrated) in the classic style, you'll find Prince of Persia 3D to be an exciting and very well-designed return to the roots of video gaming.  -- Trent C. Ward Prince of Persia will always be a classic. Many games, from Heart of Darkness to Tomb Raider, have based a lot of their designs on this game, and it still holds up after all these years. The Game Boy Color game is a near-perfect conversion of the PC game, and if you like action games with a hearty dose of puzzles, you should definitely pick this up.", "date": "Sep 25, 1999"}
