{"name": "The Ring: Terror's Realm", "name_review": "Ring (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/04/ring-import", "text": "When I first came to Japan, I was shocked to find out that the Japanese do not watch Japanese films. While movies like The World is Not Enough and The Sixth Sense continue to fill theatres in Japan (we're still a few months behind the USA), there's generally little to no interest in the latest offerings from Japanese directors. In fact, most of the people I've talked to have never seen a classic Kurosawa film like Yojimbo, Sanjuro, or Ikiru (take a break from Crazy Taxi and rent 'em from your local video store, guys!).  So when a Japanese film really does well, it's usually a complete fluke, or an amazing film. The enormously popular Ring movies have actually been pretty good, managing to scare the hell out of a good portion of the population. In the original Ring, we're introduced to a mysterious videotape that spells death to anyone who watches it. Within seven days, the sleeping viewer is visited by a ghost named Sadako, and loses all connections to this earthly plane.  Now, a game about sitting around and waiting for Sadako to kill your ass wouldn't be much fun, so the developers at Asmik have injected a good dose of the old-fashioned survival horror formula. Ring on the Dreamcast has very little to do with the films - you play a girl named Meg, thrust into the uncontrollable and maniacal universe of the Ring. It seems that Meg's boyfriend was researching something Ring-related at the local biotech laboratory, and was found very dead a few days afterwards. Meg knows that foul play is involved, and heads to the lab to get to the bottom of things. Helping her out is Jonathan, a very British Hugh Grant-style character, who is voiced by, quite possibly, the worst actor in the history of gaming. Yes, it's worse than in the US version of Maken X.  The game starts off in typical Resident Evil fashion: you have to poke around the lab for clues, and interact with cranky office ladies, and odd-looking police officers with way too many body piercings. I have problems with the ~real world~ portions of Ring -- they're just not paced well, and get pretty dull (expect the worst if you don't speak a lick of Japanese). Worst of all, they move from bad voice acting to no voice acting, so dialogue consists of a line of text scrolling by while characters pose in a semi-goofy fashion.  But when you locate your ex-boyfriend's computer, you're sucked into a bizarre simulation of the freakish, alternate universe of the Ring - which happens to look a lot like the pseudo-reality locations in Silent Hill. In this world (which resembles a decrepit 1950s version of the biotech lab), you're given a firearm, a flashlight, and are pitted against killer monkey-human hybrids who have the pants-wetting courtesy to jump out at you from every corner. You're equipped with a flashlight, and all of the lighting is real-time - if something's sneaking up on you, you're not going to actually see it until you turn around.  Poking around in Ring's pitch-black environments is highly enjoyable, and offers really outstanding jump-outta-your-seat scares at every turn. When you enter a room, and hear something crawling from off-screen, you may not want to shift into the first-person view to see what's waiting for you (I really didn't want to go into the room labeled ~Breeding~). The concept of light and shadow in this game is used more effectively than in Code Veronica -- and that's saying a lot. I just wish everyone wouldn't cast shadows that look like lava lamps.  The control in Ring is about on par with your standard Resident Evil game, but there are a few gameplay niggles I had problems with - when creatures get the jump on you, you blindly stand in one place and let them maim you for a good five seconds. There's a problem with off-screen enemies attacking, but auto-aiming keeps you on top of things. Your enemies also convulse, twitch, and bleed on the ground after you drop them - nice touch. Too bad Meg loses the ability to aim at shorter enemies when her flashlight dies - you're rendered helpless until you can find a new light source. Utter bollocks. Ring borrows a lot from Resident Evil -- maybe a bit too much. The limited inventory and ~alternate dimension storage box~ is in there, and you can only save when you find an LCD projector (a typewriter's too out of date, I suppose). At least there's dynamic loading of game environments, so even though you have to watch the ~opening door~ animation between locations, the door opens to reveal the next room instead of darkness. What a concept. Too bad those dynamic loads aren't used when you pull up the inventory screen, which takes a good four to five seconds.  There are four camera types in Ring -- the normal one uses the typical RE-style fixed-location camera, while the others attempt dynamic cameras and third-person views. These are all done very badly, and the game's much more playable with the default camera option (note: you can't change camera modes from within the actual game). Ring does have its share of problems, in terms of combat and pacing. The modeling and animation are pretty average, the sound effects are overused, and the music is terribly repetitive. It's not a particularly good game. But Ring is simply weird enough to warrant a few hours of play, which is more than I can say for the majority of the games that pass over my desk. I wouldn't recommend importing this game for full price - but if you eventually find a copy of Ring in your local importer's clearance bin for twenty bucks, you might want to take a chance. Just watch out for Sadako. -- Colin ~Zatoichi~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 4, 2000"}
