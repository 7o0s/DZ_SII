This is a good thing, because the amount of features, extras and tasty little details to warm a baseball fan's heart are easily the game's strongest features and you only get stuff like that when the developer --Acclaim Austin, in this case-- has time to build on a title year after year. But there's some bad to go along with all of that good, because some of the same flaws that have plagued the series since its days on the Nintendo 64 have inexplicably made the transition to next generation consoles, not once, but twice now. The first iteration of storied franchises, and even some new games, got plenty of leeway when we first saw them on Xbox, but now that everybody knows what the system is capable of (thank you Splinter Cell and Panzer Dragoon Orta) it's clear ASB2004 is more of a veteran slugger than a true All-Star.  Gameplay  The mixture of good and bad in ASB2004 begins early and is repeated often throughout the game, throughout different game modes. The game has perhaps the most effective front end and interface system of any sports game to date. The sepia toned menus come with flickering lines and flashes like an old film reel to give that sense of baseball nostalgia. When you select an item in a menu, nine times out of 10, the camera swoops through to a different part of the clubhouse like the locker room or general manager's office. The whole place is empty, but the effect is consistent and really keeps you immersed in the world of baseball .  The number of game modes is nice and hefty. The franchise mode is stuffed with features and a handy ASB Rulebook that acts as a clearinghouse of baseball info you  may need as you navigate your team through multiple major league seasons. Like we saw in last year's World Series Baseball you can change the market conditions your version of Major League Baseball will operate under, play with or without a trade deadline, injuries and trades. Or if you want a minimalist approach you can opt for a simple franchise mode where you don't have to worry about every little detail like that. Starting your own Franchise requires you to boot out an existing team (the-e-e-e Yankees lose!) and replace it with your own squad from Puerto Rico, Charlotte, Ottawa or any of the 45+ other real cities. The town's population, weather and altitude all matter so it's not a decision to be taken lightly. The original stadiums --watch those dimensions and draft accordingly-- and mascots you can choose from really complete the feeling that you're bringing baseball to a starving public. You'll also be charged with the task of turning every other team's castoffs --aka the expansion draft pool-- into a competitive team.  The two franchise modes stick true to the game of baseball by testing your GM skills to keep your payroll low and wheel and deal for young talent. You'll see your budget increase with playoff wins and franchises with old stadiums like the Red Sox might even end up with a brand new, original ballpark once you get deep into your franchise. Our hats are off to Acclaim for throwing in an extra like this since the whole fantasy of running our favorite teams gets better with real world events like this.  The Home Run Derby and Batting Practice modes are extremely helpful and are great ways to get your feet wet with ASB's hitting system. Scenario Mode, where you get to work your way through 21 situations from the 2002 season earning medals along the way, is a great change of pace. Playing a Pick-Up game is just like you remember from the good old days.  A random lineup of major leaguers of various skill levels and across all positions stand there while you and your opponent pick players for your team one at a time. Do you make Barry Zito or Vlad Guerrero your first pick? It ends up being a nice quick way to do battle with custom teams and is our favorite way of playing exhibition games. Playing on the middle school playground only makes it sweeter.    As great as all of those features and game modes are in terms of being the boss, most of them will eventually lead to playing games on the diamond where most of the trouble begins. Collision detection, loose controls, animation and just overall tuning come together painfully more often than not in this game to make the baseball of ASB more frustrating than anything.   Just because you induce a batter to dribble a routine groundball to the third baseman that doesn't mean you're going to get an easy out at first. The pace of the third baseman's animation to field and then throw the ball is slow enough that the runner will be his throw to first a significant percentage (at least 10) of the time. This situation, however, is preferable to those situations where the third baseman doesn't even throw to first, but instead fires towards home. Why does he throw it home with nobody on base? Well, the button register from when you pitched the ball (all pitches are initiated with A after selecting the type of pitch with the other face buttons) some how lingers after the batter hits it, so that that last button press becomes the first instruction you're giving the third baseman. Pressing A means throw it to home plate, B is first etc. What makes it most frustrating is that the play he makes towards home is seamless, quick and downright textbook. It'll drive you to tears and woe to those that like to play head-to-head with their buddies. Expect to hear the word BULLS$(@*!$(*#&$ early and often.   All-Star Baseball has always had a problem with collision detection and giving gamers that generally solid feel for how baseball is played. Moving your fielders into position you'll alternately make plays on hit balls that you don't think you should have made along with missing balls that you thought would be simple. All of this because the game engine seems to be designed in such a way that the players aren't really on the same baseball field as the ball. Like they're in parallel planes of existence that aren't quite in synch and so the interaction between players and baseballs is just slightly off. This is probably why we never saw Morpheus and Neo playing baseball in The Matrix. Throw in some genuine A.I. shortcomings such as the one where you'll automatically be given control of an outfielder as a fly ball is coming down, yet another CPU controlled player ends up making the play because he's the one you should've been controlling in the first place. The whole thing, the part where you're playing baseball, just ends up feeling messy.      Even within the game there are a ton of features and options that end up being hampered by the shoddy baseball. We love the fact that you have to warm up pitchers (you'll even see them in each stadium's bullpen), manage your lineups and even pull of double switches. These features along with the all powerful mound visits, where you'll get tips on the current situation with your pitcher, the upcoming batters and the option to buy some extra time for your relief pitcher, should be included in all baseball games from here on out.   Anybody that picks up ASB 2004 will no doubt find out some of the cool little things that have been thrown in here and there, but no amount of detail can overcome the fact that the gameplay is far below what it should be given that it's on Xbox and the year is 2003.  Graphics  All-Star presents a dilemma when it comes to the animation of the baseball players because on the one hand the motion captured moves are very realistic and fluid, but on the other hand, the transitions from one canned sequence to another is horrible. So your second baseman attempting to turn a double play looks good ranging toward the bag, he looks good catching the relay and firing it to first but the transition from the first animation to the second is so abrupt that it's the visual equivalent of a vinyl album skipping on your turntable. The end of the ~running towards second base~ animation puts him in a position that doesn't match the beginning of the ~relay throw to first~ animation. This problem is evident all over the field and affects base runners, batters, fielders, umpires and would probably affect the lemonade vendors in the bleachers if they were there.  The frustration comes from the fact that there are so many wonderful animations sprinkled throughout the game. Basket catches by outfielders on routine flyballs, field umpires calling homeruns, outs, fair and fly balls  and pitcher reactions to called balls and strikes are absolutely splendid in and of themselves, but it's a crapshoot when it comes to the transitions into and out of those moves.  The player models are yet another mixed bag of pluses and minuses. The player faces are pretty damn accurate so that you'll easily recognize superstars like Randy Johnson and Barry Bonds, while non-stars look a bit more generic. The players aren't high res but there is self shadowing even though the lighting in the game is nothing special. In the end the players don't look as good as you know they should on Xbox. The batter/pitcher interface (the perspective you'll be seeing 90% of the time) reveals the flaws in the player models with the pitcher looking blockier and jaggier(?) than the batter. The pitcher should look like he's 60 feet, 6 inches away, not lower resolution like he's less than a man or something. The ballplayers in MVP 2003 and WSB 2K3 both look better than ASB's players.    The stadiums, uniforms and crowds are definitely strong points, while the replay system is a bad joke. The free replay you get on a homerun it's choppy at best, and unwatchable at worst. When you decide to take matters into your own hands you can move forward and backward through the play using the left analog stick and zoom in and out on the right stick, but there's no kind of free-camera system. Your only option is to switch angles using the X button. Not very effective when you're just barely missing where the ball lands or where somebody's foot is because there's somebody in the way or if you simply want to play the replay again. You'll need a steady thumb on the analog stick to replay in real time.   Sound  The option for Spanish-language announcing is the best thing ever for a baseball game. Instead of Steve Lyons and Thom Brennamen, you only get the solo broadcaster in Spanish, but for people used to listening to Major League Baseball on the radio, the one  voice system will work for you. For those of you who skipped those high school or community college Spanish classes, ASB might be clever way to get you bilingual education on in the privacy of your own home. You at least be able to strike up a conversation about baseball with Fidel Castro, if you ever meet him. That's the power of sports.  The announcing duo of Lyons and Brennamen are generally on point and have a surprising amount of dialogue. While we're not really Steve Lyons fans it is cool to hear him go off on some long winded story the Brennamen sets him up with every now and then.  As far as sound effects, the baseball sounds and crowd noises are all well done. The licensed music that plays when your batters step up the plate is a nice touch and even sounds like it's coming from the stadium speaker. Unfortunately the mix of music leaves a little to be desired since Cool J's ~Mama Said Knock You Out~ comes up far too often, but still not quite as much as DMX's ~Party Up~, another obvious baseball tune. Customizable soundtracks would've worked so well here too. It's even more maddening because you can choose the walk-up music for every player in the game through the player customization menu. Everything from House of Pain's ~Jump Around~ to the four, count 'em four, generic Latin Music songs are available.   The theme from ~The Natural~ and Smashmouth's amazingly appropriate ~All-Star~ are used very effectively on the menu screen, and in the game's intro, respectively. You'll know ~The Natural~ by heart in a matter of minutes.  ASB04 has nearly everything you could want from a baseball game except a good baseball engine. We didn't even mention all of the great old school players from the Dead Ball era, Negro Leagues and post WWII legends featured in the game since it would probably just frustrate everybody even more. The game improved the feature set from ASB 03, but that's it. The baseball engine isn't strong enough for Acclaim Austin to get away with a few extremely cool cosmetic upgrades wrapped around the same subpar baseball game. We were dazzled in 1998 by the N64 game but we're baffled today by the limited evolution of the gameplay. The initial promise of online gameplay through Xbox Live fell through for whatever reasons, but we still have to hold Acclaim accountable for that promise. The downloadable rosters will be nice but it's nowhere near what we were expecting.I would recommend checking out ASB2004 if for no other reason than to see the game modes, options and other features because they're that impressive, but I know that's a tall order.", "date": "Feb 26, 2003"}
