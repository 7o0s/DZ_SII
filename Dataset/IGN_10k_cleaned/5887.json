Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant is part of their stream of ~Star Wars~ games to run exclusively on Cingular (until next year). Based on the opening scene of ~Sith,~ Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant puts you in the cockpit of Anakin Skywalker's Jedi Starfighter as the separatist army stages a massive assault on the Republic's capitol planet.   The scene is ripe with vid potential, and THQ Wireless' decision to convert it into a shooter for the smallest screen was a no-brainer. Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant offers exactly what you would expect from the game: several levels of solid top-down blasting action. Droid ships rocket into the screen and volley laser fire at Anakin's ship, occasionally locking on to it with missiles or ganging up on it in great numbers. There are few moments of non-action in Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant and with nice, bite-sized levels, the game never gets dull.   Shooters by nature are a little repetitive, so complaints that you're doing the same thing over and over again in each level are unfair. Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant actually makes an effort to give each mission some sort of hook, such as a rescue run where you must protect Obi-Wan's ship after it has been overwhelmed by droid fighters.   As you blast droid ships, you can pick up a series of power-ups. Extra laser power makes shooting down droid ships much easier, especially if you can stack them a few deep. One power-up replenishes your hull integrity while another grants R2-D2 the juice to cast a shield around your ship. And since this is a shooter, another power-up gives you points.   I do have one complaint about the way the game knocks you back if your ship is destroyed. Most shooters simply resurrect you in the exact spot you died -- in exchange for giving up your power-ups. Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant not only strips you of your extra firepower, but it tosses you all the way back to the beginning of the level. Sure, the levels are shorter than, say, a console shooter -- but having to blast yourself all the way back to the part where you died is unfortunate.   Star Wars: Battle Above Coruscant is a pretty good-looking shooter. The game uses movie stills and backdrops to recreate the film, such as the crop circle-esque nightlights of Coruscant's largest cities. While flying, you will notice a secondary level of action beneath you, usually a bunch of pre-TIE fighters blasting each other. It doesn't distract like we thought it would, but instead gives the feeling that you are part of a giant war. Fans of the movie will easily identify the ships.   The game plays a looping track from the movie soundtracks -- it's a decent approximation of the epic score, but since fans will be so familiar with the original material, the beep-boop edition will sound a little weak.I enjoyed Star Wars: Battle Above Courscant for what it was, a top-down shooter with some well-done ~Star Wars~ trimmings. The action is often fast and furious, and with all of the eye candy, it's sometimes easy to get a little lost. The game features great ship models and explosions, and I liked the inclusion of movie assets. As mentioned, though, the sound is a little wonky. However, if you are in the mood for something ~Star Wars~ (because the rest of the summer's offerings have been decidedly underwhelming), Star Wars: Battle Above Courscant is a good purchase.", "date": "Jul 19, 2005"}
