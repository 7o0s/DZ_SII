After all, these cellphone-cum-game platforms are already online-enabled, jacking into a global network from the moment you power the thing on. So why is it taking so long to for the future to get here? The answer? Network speeds. Real-time multiplayer is only as good as the network speed you play on, and that's why most game makers have stayed away from going after this grail.   However, THQ Wireless and developer Mikoishi have found a clever way to step around network speed issues and still deliver a solid multiplayer experience. While you may not necessarily engage an opponent in direct combat, your actions, once piped over to a server, have an effect on a large-scale battle between different factions that you and your friends are part of. It's a workaround that won't please everybody, but it pleases this reviewer -- especially since the reviewer doubles as a ~Star Wars~ fan.   Star Wars Battlefront Mobile bows today exclusively on Cingular, catching a little heat off the DVD launch of ~Revenge of the Sith,~ which also drops today. At the same time, Lucasarts has released Star Wars Battlefront II on Xbox, PS2, and PCs. There's a whole lotta Jedi love going around today, and it's good to see mobile being a good part of it.   Star Wars Battlefront Mobile follows the basic formula of the console game. You choose a side in one of two galactic conflicts: Empire versus Rebellion in the struggle from the original trilogy, or the Galactic Republic versus the Confederacy of Independent Systems from the Clone Wars, subject of the prequel trilogy. After you choose a faction to fight for, you are then thrust into the middle of an ongoing conflict. The battle doesn't begin or end due to your participation -- you are just a cog in the mighty war machine, but depending on how well you fare in battle, your efforts may inch your side to eventual victory.   The battle stretches across a total of fifteen planets, each planet with several nodes. When you look at the planet select screen, you see a percentage of how much of each region you control. Your goal is to get in there and not only shore up planets that you already own a commanding percentage of, but also attempt to turn the tide in campaigns where your faction is losing. There is a useful ticker that lets you know the progress of the battle in the various regions. If you are the Empire, you may be prompted to join a battle on the Death Star, for example, where your faction is losing control of a few nodes due to an influx of Rebellion activity.   As mentioned, you do not directly challenge another player. Instead, when you select a planet and node to fight on, you go into a shooting gallery sequence composed of several screens. Using a cursor, you must blast Rebel scum, Storm Troopers, Wookies, and other ~enemies~ off the screen. The further you make it into the node, the more ~points~ you score for your faction. You can use thermal detonators to clear the screen, and if you are lucky enough to uncover (and shoot) a vehicle icon, you can use AT-ATs or tanks, which have individual fire patterns far greater than your basic blaster.   When the sequence is over, the results are uploaded to the server and the amount of influence/control your faction has on the planet either goes up or down. Especially cool is the constant refresh rate. Every sixty seconds, THQ Wireless updates the servers with new information. After finishing a battle, hang in there for a minute to see the results go live. If the Empire control over Hoth was, say, 65-35 and you completed an entire shooting sequence for the Rebellion, you may see the refresh turn to 62-38. It all depends on how many players are signed up for a faction, and how many are playing in one specific location. That's where the ticker comes in quite handy -- it keeps you closer to galactic hot spots.    There are actual in-game rewards for helping the cause. Star Wars Battlefront Mobile invokes a ranking system that affects your stature on the battlefield. The more you participate, and the better you do, you can rise in rank. The Priority Sector High Commander, for example, enjoys the benefit of extra health, extra time in each battle, and added probability of using a vehicle. Your rank is so fearful, that you will also see a decrease in the number of enemies during your battle. Some ranks, such as this one, also have team effects. If you join the fight on the Death Star, other Empire players on the planet will also receive health boosts.   Rank is fleeting, though. You have to keep gaming -- and gaming well -- to hold on to your title. There are a maximum number of players that can hold a rank at one time. Only ten players can be Major General. Only two players in a faction can be Admiral at the same time. And if you log out for too long, you may find yourself discovering you've been busted down in rank several positions during the absence.   Star Wars Battlefront Mobile is quite an attractive game. The ~Star Wars~ themes -- characters, planets, etc. -- are expertly rendered here. Everything is instantly recognizable, from storm trooper helmets to some of the set pieces from memorable planets. Top presentation means a lot to fans of ~Star Wars,~ and Mikoishi does not disappoint.  Star Wars Battlefront Mobile is an incredibly ambitious game for THQ Wireless. They have effectively created a persistent mobile online world, and even though you do not directly combat other players, your influence is always felt when you play. You feel like you are definitely part of a bigger picture, especially the first time a successful battle turns the tide in your favor.Star Wars Battlefront Mobile is exclusive to Cingular right now, and this must be mentioned for potential players. Unless you pay the flat fee for data transfer, Star Wars Battlefront Mobile could get expensive. I say this not to deter anybody, but to prepare them. The last thing Cingular or THQ Wireless needs is for you to see a massive spike on your bill unexpectedly, and then make with the angry phone calls.I heartily recommend Star Wars Battlefront Mobile to all ~Star Wars~ fans and mobile gamers. It's a great step in the right direction for community play, which puts us all one step closer to making the Next Big Thing in mobile gaming the Big Thing.", "date": "Nov 1, 2005"}
