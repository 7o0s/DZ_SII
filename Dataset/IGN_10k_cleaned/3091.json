Jimmy Neutron vs. Jimmy Negatron, one of THQ's newest Nickelodeon-branded Game Boy games, has the potential to be a great GBA title, but its clever use of Mode 7 and rendered graphics for its environment is hindered by somewhat bland level design, strange collision detection, and a handful of bad gameplay ideas. It's a shame, too, since the game honestly looks like the developer put a whole lot of effort into its design. Features 10 worldswith three levels each Two playable characters Link cable support for four players (single and multiple cartridge) Password save Only for Game Boy Advance Jimmy Neutron vs. Jimmy Negatron is actually the second Jimmy Neutron game to ship for the Game Boy Advance. Unlike the first game featuring the computer rendered boy genius (who has his own pretty cool computer rendered television show on Nickelodeon),  Jimmy Neutron vs. Jimmy Negatron (which will hereby be known as JN vs. JN just to save on my precious fingers) is a uniquely designed 3D-style platformer that utilizes the GBA hardware scaling and rotation to excellent use. Technically it's a stunning development, with all that's going on in the game. As a whole, though, there's just so much wrong with the implementation of the game mechanics that it's just so frustrating to play.  The game puts players in the role of, who else, Jimmy Neutron, who's been forcefully pushed into a strange alternate dimension by his alter-ego, Jimmy Negatron...represented by a goateed version of the boy genius (obviously a nod to good ol' evil Spock). Jimmy Neutron will have to jump from dimension to dimension, fixing issues within each area to gain access to other dimensions...eventually regaining access to his home dimension and a fight to the finish with Jimmy Negatron himself. Players can even choose to play as Jimmy's robot dog if they want. The game even features a few link cable games for players who want to challenge their buddies, including a coin collecting challenge, a sheepherding challenge, and a clone of Asteroids. The game is a decently long one, with more than ten different places to explore, each with three different challenges and a boss battle. The game unfortunately utilizes password save instead of cartridge save to record the progress, using an interesting combination of capital letters and circled versions of those letters.  The concept of JN vs. JN is interesting enough, and it has a promising implementation with a 3D engine that's smooth and detailed. But the issues are deep. Most levels are of the jump from platform to platform variety, with the challenge coming from the enemy sprites trying to ~hit~ you, either by getting in your way or by lobbing projectiles at you.  That would be an acceptable challenge if the execution wasn't so poorly done...if your character takes a hit, he'll flash for a bit, and jump to a seemingly random location that was close to the spot you took a hit. Problem is that it doesn't care where it places you...even if it's right on top of another enemy. And if that happens (which it does a lot), your character will fall off the platform and placed on yet another spawn point. Which could mean that you might take another hit if you're placed on another enemy. Controls are also a bit sloppy, with the fact that you can walk towards the camera and awkwardly reverse the rotation of the camera...if the developer had simply made Jimmy walk backwards when pushing down on the D-pad, there wouldn't be a problem. And honestly, there's absolutely no reason why Jimmy needs to be facing the camera while moving backwards. None. But in all honesty, the horrible design issues can be somewhat overlooked if you absolutely had to play the game (say, if your grandmother bought you the game for an A on your report card or whatever), and if you can withstand a whole bunch of annoying enemy collisions during the game, JN vs. JN isn't terrible. In fact, the originality in design is enough to give this game a look. Just be sure you keep in mind that it is awkwardly flawed in its uniqueness.", "date": "Oct 22, 2002"}
