Consumers get two games for the price of one, and publishers make money off of the games again. Where the plan falls apart is when publishers like Destination Software Inc decide that instead of republishing crappy Skyworks developed ATV and Monster Truck games on the Nintendo DS, to instead bring their even worse Game Boy Advance versions and jam them onto one cartridge. Behold, ATV: Thunder Ridge Riders / Monster Trucks DS. A game that is as clunky and stupid as its title.   Despite these games being on the same cartridge, there is nothing congruent about them. The menu systems are completely different, and the visual and sound of each game are nothing alike. In fact, there isn't even a way to switch between the two games without resetting the DS. Clearly this was not a melding of these two titles, but rather a shoddy mashing of stuff they already had lying around.   It's a cheap cop out to port two old games and repackage them, but it's even more insulting when both games are terrible. When you have a bunch of crap, doubling the amount doesn't make the situation better!   ATV: Thunder Ridge Riders is a lie right from the start. These racers are not riding along ridges. Sure, there are ridges around the area, but it's more like a valley or canyon race. Also, there is nothing thunderous about the place. In fact it's always sunny and mild during these events. Maybe ATV: Sunny Valley Riders didn't score as well with the test market.    Players compete in four person races, passing through checkpoints along the track to keep them going the right way. It's a first-person perspective, so all the player sees is their character's gloves and handlebars.   The game has one large environment that is makes different tracks out of by blocking off certain paths. The level design is so bland that every tracks ends up looking the same anyway. The developer's idea of track progression is to make each one longer than the last. By the time we got into our fifth race the three laps felt like an eternity.   We might have been less bored if the ATVs could do anything interesting. Despite there being hills, our ATV couldn't manage to build up enough speed to clear them. It's odd, since the AI opponents have no problem blasting over the hills as shortcuts. Despite the opponents' use of magic, super-ATVs, they have a hard time keeping pace.   Monster Trucks, by comparison, is nearly the polar opposite of Thunder Ridge Riders. For starters, the game delivers on the promise of its title. There are indeed Monster Trucks in this game. Honestly, that's the only positive thing we can really think of.   The concept of physics is completely absent from these trucks, which turn on a dime going at top speed. That top speed is a mystery, since there is no speedometer of any sort. So it could be three miles an hour, because that about as fast as the trucks feel like they're going.   Also unlike Thunder Ridge Riders, Monster Truck's AI opponents do not have any trouble keeping up with us. Actually, they usually beat us. It's not that the AI is too hard, because the cars bounce and bang around the tracks like their drivers are intoxicated. But somehow, despite them running into each other, and swerving unnecessarily, they maintain their top speed and just blast through the track.   Both games do have a few things in common, besides being chores to play. They both have an upgrade system that does nothing at all. We spent the money we earned from races on upgrades engines and whatnot, but there's no way to tell. The vehicles never change to show it off, and they seem to perform exactly the same.   Also, both games look awful. ATV makes use of the voxel element for it's terrain, but they're so big that the ground looks boxy and weird. Monster Trucks uses multiple shades of brown and still can't manage to make a track that looks like dirt. The trucks are tiny and plain on the screen, offering no flair at all. Monster Trucks are a pretty flamboyant vehicle, and yet ours has nothing exciting going for it. It's just green.It doesn't make a lot of sense to make a two-pack of games for the DS with a couple of GBA titles, especially when the DS already has crappy versions of those games on the system. It makes even less sense when the games being ported are so bad they make the crappy real DS versions look awesome by comparison. These games weren't fun three years ago, and they're really not fun now. Both games look and sound awful, and despite playing very differently, they both manage to be equally as painful. Hopefully DSI won't decide to re-publish their bad old games again, because if we see a port of the GBA version of Deal or No Deal in three years, we'll be pissed.", "date": "Jan 22, 2008"}
