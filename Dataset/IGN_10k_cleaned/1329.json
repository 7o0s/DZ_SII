But the company didn't -- ESPN International Track & Field for the Game Boy Color is a brand-new development with the classic Track & Field in mind. And it's another fun rendition, even if the Game Boy Color isn't tailored for the whole button-mashing genre. Features Twelve events Battery back-up Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color   You'll notice right away that in the latest version of the International Track & Field series for the portable, Konami ditched the custom character mode from the version released earlier this year. The new edition is a back-to-the-basics 12-event game that emphasizes speed, timing and stamina. Most games focus on how fast you can rapidly tap the A and B buttons in sequence to provide the energy needed for speed and strength in these events, but there are a couple laid back events that just require more timing than brute speed -- which are a nice breather in between the speed events.   The events in ESPN International Track & Field: 100 Meter Dash (button-masher) Long Jump(button-masher) Fencing (timing) Javelin (button-masher) 100 Meter Freestyle Swimming (timing) 110 Meter Hurdles (button-masher) High Jump (button-masher) Weight Lifting (button-masher) Pole Vault (button-masher) Gymnastics Vault (timing) Skeet Shooting (timing) Table Tennis (timing)   In terms of game design and graphics, this rendition is a little better than the last version of the series -- but the gameplay really hasn't changed across the board. Two modes of play are available -- you can opt to go through a randomized, ten-event championship, or just play individual events one at a time. The downside to the individual play is that only six events are readily available...you have to earn a medal per event to unlock the next four events. But to unlock the Skeet Shooting and Table Tennis, you have to get a gold on the previous ten -- and that's pretty difficult for the standard player. Myself, the only event I've had trouble with is the Javelin event -- the gold medal in that one is just out of my initial capabilities. And again, Konami adds link cable support so two players can challenge each other on separate systems. Excellent.  The downside to this version of Track and Field is identical to the downside in last year's version -- the Game Boy Color just isn't the best system for this type of game. It's difficult to use the A and B buttons for speed and then stretch your thumb over to hit the control pad for the ~action.~ That, and the fact that the screen shakes with your motions, making it difficult to see what the heck's going on. The Game Boy Advance will be much better suited for this series thanks to the inclusion of shoulder buttons, but for now it's not going to be easy getting a portable version of the classic button-masher.        It's hard to pick between the two versions of Track and Field that have been released this year alone for the Game Boy Color. This new version's great because of 12 solid events and nice graphics, but the last version's decent because of the RPG-style character building mode. If you love the series, you can't go wrong with having both, especially since this version has other events that didn't make the cut in the last one.", "date": "Oct 11, 2000"}
