{"name": "PGA Tour 1998", "name_review": "PGA Tour '98", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/01/pga-tour-98", "text": "Golf titles have traditionally sold well on the PC, but have been less of a force on consoles. Part of this reason is that console owners are expecting swift gameplay without having to wait on long loading times, something most golf games cannot provide. PGA Tour 98 is better than its PlayStation predecessor where long loading times are concerned, but still slow enough to be frustrating. The main problem is that this wait occurs between the time a player hits the swing button and when the on-screen golfer starts his swing.  While the wait is never excruciating, it manages to remind players they are only controlling digital sprites.  The landscapes are nice, but nothing spectacular.  The now-familiar sprite-based trees and obstacles look less exciting in each new title as the age of polygonal graphics continues to bypass golf titles.  Even the characters are made of blocky, unexciting sprites which add nothing to the realism.   Like the rest of the titles from EA Sports, the front end and details are as good as it gets.  Players can choose from four separate courses, and can adjust them to any turf condition they wish to face.  A wide variety of competition options keep the title from getting boring quickly, but it always comes down to the same problems with frustrating load times.  If EA could match the polish and details in PGA Tour 98 with the fast gameplay of a title such as VR Golf, then it would have a title worth checking out.  As it stands, this title will only appeal to the hard-core golfing fanatic.  PSX Staff", "date": "Oct 1, 1997"}
