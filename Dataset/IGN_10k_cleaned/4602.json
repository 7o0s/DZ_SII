The first, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, featured five cases that ended with a twist. It was very engaging and entertaining. With this follow-up title, they took it to the next level, fixing a couple of the annoying problems with the first one, upgrading all the already impressive artwork and bringing in five new cases that will tax your investigative brain.The five cases are all well written and in line with what one would expect from the Thursday night drama on CBS. Using various tools to discover and collect evidence, the player is tasked with examining every area of a crime scene. Finding that hidden blood stain or that minute piece of hair not visible to the naked eye are just two of the critical pieces to be mastered. There are three locations to visit to assist players in their investigation. The medical examiner is where bodies are taken after being collected from the crime scene. Detective Brass can obtain search warrants, bring in suspects for interrogation or find addresses. Finally, Greg - the lab technician - can further analyze trace evidence, documents and items to give you even more clues. At Greg's area, there is also a microscope to compare fibers or examine photographs closer and a computer to do fingerprint and DNA searches as well as other functions. A fun part of doing comparisons is that several options will pop up and the player will have to eyeball them to see if there is a match.When a case is completed, players are whisked back to Grissom's office for an evaluation. It is an observational quiz that will ask the player five questions about the case - so paying attention to details is critical. Asking for hints in the built in hint system will count against the final evaluation, but answering questions correctly will help that evaluation. There are rewards to obtaining Master level in each case in the form of concept art and storyboards. There are four difficulty levels from easy to very hard, so the truly talented CSI's out there can challenge themselves.Interface and controls are the same as the first game. There is some pixel hunting, as you want to find a hotspot (although for those masochists out there, you can turn off hotspots) where you can interact or pick up items from the crime scene. The interface is very intuitive and not intrusive to the experience. Most hot spots are obviously visible - making the discovering of the evidence relatively painless. More time is spent trying to figure out what to do with the evidence and following the case than trying to find that elusive clue.The art is very well done - you believe you are looking at them. They improved upon the already solid graphics in the first title, making everything more detailed and realistic. The flashes (cutscenes in a game) familiar in the drama are here and sometimes they have a little too much detail - much like the television show. The voices are of the actors from the show, which lends to immersion. Good background music and sound effects round out the artistic side to the title nicely.I was wondering where that went... The load time in starting each case was pretty long, but once done, you can play through the whole case without a stall, provided you don't exit the game. There was one particularly annoying bug that is known according to Ubi.com's knowledge base. After a period of time passes playing the game, all text on menus and subtitles will disappear. Closing the game and restarting it fixes the problem, but it can pull you out of the game's immersion - never a good thing.Despite the flaws, CSI: Dark Motives is a solid title.  It improves upon the first game and gives us more of the same goodness.  If I had one complaint, it would be the same as the first title.  It is far too short.  I'd really like to see their next title with ten cases - but maybe that is just me being greedy.  Its a fantastic game and five cases do not feel like enough.  Fantastic graphics, the wonderful voice actors, interesting cases with again a little twist at the end and a few surprises for the fanatics of the first title are all here.  For anyone who enjoys CSI or point and click investigation titles, CSI: Dark Motives is a must add to that library.", "date": "Mar 31, 2004"}
