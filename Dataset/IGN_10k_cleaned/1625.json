Other than the decent (but still lacking) Street Fighter Alpha from Crawfish and Capcom, the genre's been both barren of quality and saturated with mediocrity. And this trend doesn't seem to want to end, after playing Crave's Ultimate Fighting Championship -- what could have been a fun game is watered down with poor collision detection and lousy opponent AI, as well as unintentional one-button gameplay that makes this game an extremely unwise purchase decision. Features Eight fighters Four fighting options Only for Game Boy Color  The UFC is a Game Boy Color fighter based on the actual real-life circuit where nearly anything goes  the last man standing is the victor.  Unlike other one-on-one 2D fighters, UFC removes the side-by-side limitation and allows for full ring movement, which gives fighters the freedom to escape from any on-coming attack.  The game has serious potential, as the character sprites are huge for Game Boy standards, and the animation is pretty slick. Unfortunately, that's all the game has going for it, as it feels completely unfinished in terms of features and control tweaks. It's as if Crave pulled the plug mid-development to insure the game got on shelves for the holiday.  First of all, the collision detection is absolutely horrible. You literally have to be on the exact horizontal plane of the opposing fighter for a punch or kick to land. If you stray north or south within the fight, there's no way a hit will connect  and to pull off any of the more special moves, you have to push up/down and a button, which will more than likely move your character in the direction your pushing. This really makes the ~move anywhere~ design of the ring kind of pointless.   Worse yet, the controls don't reverse when facing in the opposite direction. To block a hit, the controls are left+A. When facing to the right, this makes sense since you're pushing the controls away from your opponent. But if your character wanders to the other side of the opponent, you're now facing to the left  and the controls remain: left+A is block. This goes against the mentality of any fighter on the market, and makes the game that much more of a chore to play.   Now all this would actually matter, but here's the kicker  you can play the game from start to finish by performing one move: tapping the A button. That's the ultimate test of any fighter  if you can find one move that will destroy any computer opponent, the game's not worth playing. And it's true for UFC -- I played through all the modes of the game (Tournament, VS. Survival) on the hardest level, and ended up as the World Championship simply holding the control pad towards the opponent and tapping the A button. I didn't even have to watch the screen during this hour feat.  The game lacks link-cable support as well, which could have saved the game from the Pit of Dispair. If you can find the holes in the computer AI in a fighter, at least you could rely on playing against another human opponent  except in UFC. No two player mode means an even more unfun Game Boy Color game.  The only good thing I can say about UFC is its character size and animation. That's it. The game is clunky and unfinished, it lacks any challenge once you figure out the obvious trick to overcoming the computer AI. It doesn't even have a two player mode. It's down for the count even before it knows what hit it.", "date": "Dec 12, 2000"}
