Through a series of turn-based battles, you will decide the outcome of one of the bloodiest conflicts in American history.   Developer Enorbus smartly streamlines many of the cornerstones of the genre, making Civil War: Road to Gettysburg straight-forward enough for any gamer to come to grips with. At the onset of each battle, you use the spoils of war to fortify units. You can buy additional cavalry for ranged attacks or militia for close-quart combat, for example. After purchasing the required troops and equipment for the campaign, it's off to battle.   The game unfolds across a series of maps that are not as varied as we would have liked, but they nonetheless offer some challenge. The maps are divided into a grid. Some terrain cannot be crossed, limiting attack routes. You can use this to bottleneck your enemy. After moving, you can attack an enemy unit if they are within range. This is where units like the cavalry are especially useful -- in fact, they may be too useful because if you are able to fortify your forces with enough units with ranged abilities, you can keep the approaching army at bay.   Attacking turns are broken down into basic attacks and counter-attacks. If you launch an attack and enough members of the opposing unit survive, they can counter-attack. If you have a weak force, it's best to hold them back, lest you risk them being wiped out in a counter-attack. Use the rest command to restore a unit's health and fight another day. Besides, each unit earns experience that will help them better their battle skills. Don't waste a battle-hardened unit on a fruitless attack just because they are in range.   We downloaded Civil War: Road to Gettysburg on an LG VX8000. The game screen was bright and crisp. The units are easily recognized, thanks to defined sprites. The music is limited, but good.  Civil War: Road to Gettysburg is a streamlined strategy game that casual gamers can get into without much struggle. Unfortunately, this means that experienced players may find it too simple, too easy. Once you earn enough money to load up on ranged units, the game turns into a cakewalk. A good entry point for beginners, but otherwise, the more hardcore may want to seek out alternate fare.", "date": "May 26, 2005"}
