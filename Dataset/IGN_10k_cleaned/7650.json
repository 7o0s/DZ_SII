Its unique hardware features have been accepted by the masses, and have revitalized some gaming genres that had been in danger of fading away - chief among these, the portable puzzle game. Titles like Polarium, Meteos and Tetris DS have demonstrated that touch screen control is a perfect match for sliding, shifting and eliminating a grid of blocks or tiles. Add now to their number Konductra.    An independently-developed project that both bears a resemblance to and differentiates itself from the puzzlers of the past, Konductra is a high-voltage concept that, in the end, is not quite electrifying. The design feels like it's missing something - like it's on the right path, but doesn't make that final connection.    Making connections is the focus of the gameplay, which takes place primarily on the touch screen. There an open grid is displayed, ten columns wide by seven rows tall. You're called upon to place colored tiles into these vacant spaces, trying to make an unbroken line of like hues from one conductor to another.    The conductors are on each edge of the field, alternating between black and white. An example of a successful play would be stringing a set of blue tiles vertically down the field, connecting a black conductor at the top to another black conductor at the bottom. This task achieved, you can then ~set off~ the chain by placing the stylus on the first conductor, tracing an unbroken line across each of the blue tiles, and ending the trace on top of the second conductor. When you lift the stylus off the screen, electricity flows through your created connection and destroys each tile in the path - sometimes earning points, sometimes completing objectives.    The gameplay may be difficult for some to grasp from a text explanation alone, and Konductra addresses that by including an introductory tutorial, complete with voice-over. The concept is easier to pick up on after viewing it in action - it's in the execution where the design's potential starts to dissipate.    The pace of Konductra is slow. Plodding. It seems to take forever for things to get going, for the speed to pick up - there's little incentive to play that long. Score Mode - Konductra's ~endless~ mode where you keep playing until you've painted yourself into a corner and can't make a move any more - feels dull. Though the speed does increase as you score more points, and a greater variety of tiles is introduced on higher levels, the effort seems wasted. Futile.    Konductra gives you too much control. In other puzzlers, blocks or tiles assault the playing field relentlessly - cascading into the pit in Tetris, or crashing down from orbit in Meteos. It's constant. It doesn't stop. Playing those games is playing for survival, trying to manage the stack and keep from being overwhelmed.    Konductra isn't Tetris or Meteos, and no direct comparison is implied. Those games are simply used as examples to illustrate a quality Konductra lacks - a sense of danger. In Konductra, you're not fighting the random forces of the game. You're fighting yourself. You're the one who chooses where to place each tile, only to later choose when to eliminate them. It's like someone handing you four quarters, and you giving them a dollar back. An exchange has been made, but you haven't gained anything from it.    The sense of danger could be argued to appear at higher difficulty levels, but more likely you'll find a sense of frustration with yourself - after all, if you're stuck in a bad situation in Konductra, it's because you're the one who chose to place the tiles where you did.    Thankfully, Konductra isn't built entirely on its Score Mode. Task Mode takes great strides in salvaging the potential of the design, by introducing an incredibly key element - a goal. In Task Mode, a set pattern of tiles is displayed on the upper screen. It's up to you to arrange tiles on the touch screen below in the same pattern, and then eliminate them all in a single conducting connection. This is true puzzling, and it's immensely more satisfying to play. Having an end goal, something tangible to strive for to achieve a win condition, is exactly what you'll want. You'll find it here.       The same kind of disconnect between game modes has been seen once before, in Polarium. That game's ~endless~ mode was arguably almost unplayable, but its slow-paced and thoughtful Puzzle Mode was a blast. The developers realized this, and its sequel, Polarium Advance, featured nothing but puzzles. Konductra's strength is similarly placed.    Beyond Score and Task, Konductra rounds out its offering with a variety of Vs. modes. You can take on five different levels of artificial intelligence, or challenge other humans through local wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Here, Konductra's potential heats up again. The pace of play is still slow, and individual contests can last for quite a while, but the element of competition makes things more interesting. Completing conductions and chains sends blocks to your opponent, making life more difficult on their increasingly crowded field - you win when you've crowded their grid completely and they can't make any more moves.Konductra's potential loses some charge in the conversion to kinetic, leaving you with a slower and duller play experience than you'd expect from a lightning-themed game. The aspects of the game that embrace that pace are satisfying, and fans of thoughtful, task-oriented brainteasers will find a lot to like here  but fast and frenetic puzzle action is better found in other DS titles.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
