Absorbent and yellow and porous is he. SpongeBob Squarepants, the sponge with square pants, has managed to become a cult icon among both children and the kids at heart. It's hard not to love this nerdy and socially inept fry cook who parades around with a horribly stupid starfish, karate practicing squirrel, money grubbing crab, stuck up squid, and a piece of plankton with a napoleon complex.    While SpongeBob has a lot of kid friendliness (bright colors, morals, and general craziness), it's also so wickedly twisted that it easily appeals to adults that can look past the kiddy trimmings -- cameos by Nosferatu and atomic bombs and sing-a-longs with lyrics like 'F is for fire that burns down the whole town, U is for uranium -- bombs, N is for no survivors...' keeps things interesting. If this sort of nautical nonsense is something you wish ... then join SpongeBob for the Battle for Bikini Bottom.    Gameplay  Plankton's up to his old schemes for world conquest. He's created a legion of robots, but through a technical mishap they aren't obeying him -- instead they're tearing apart his would be kingdom. Through a bit of fast talking, Plankton enlists SpongeBob, Patrick (pink starfish), and Sandy (space suit wearing squirrel) to Battle for Bikini Bottom.    The basics of SpongeBob are fairly simple. Regardless of the broad appeal (to fans at least) of this title, at heart it's a kids game. You wander throughout Bikini Bottom and surrounding regions on a platforming adventure -- collecting things like shiny objects, smelly socks, and golden spatulas, avoiding marauding robots, flames, and spikes, and navigating moving platforms. Yes, at its core it's a collect-a-thon, but you rarely feel like you're on a never ending fetch quest.     Shiny objects are abundant -- and you rarely spend time actually collecting them. SpongeBob acts as a shiny object magnet -- he'll automatically collect them from every robot or evil tiki he destroys. You actually have to look for socks, which can be traded in for golden spatulas like shiny objects, but you'll usually stumble across them if you're methodically exploring environments. Golden spatulas are the only important commodity, because they're needed to unlock new areas for the sponge and crew to explore. Spatulas are usually acquired by completing quests for characters -- so you're rarely forced to collect stuff since you acquire it in the process of playing.    As SpongeBob runs wild through Bikini Bottom, Goo Lagoon, Chum Bucket, Rock Bottom, Tree Dome, and the Jelly Fish Fields, he'll run into a lot of familiar characters like Mr. Krabs, Squidward, Mrs. Puff, Bubble Buddy, Larry, and Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, who will send him on any number of quests. Your goal might be to replace an antenna on a far away rooftop, find steering wheels, obtain King Jelly Fish jelly, defeat a huge robot, or fry a sunscreen swiping bot by manipulating mirrors. While each quest requires various amounts of platforming and robot bashing, they never feel too repetitive. Each stage has a different personality, there's a good variety between searching out and destroying things, mini-games, and you gradually unlock new abilities that diversify basic jump and attack gameplay.    SpongeBob tackles his adventures in tag team fashion. At bus stops scattered throughout each level, you can swap out SpongeBob for Patrick or Sandy (depending on the level). While there are some sections that can be conquered by any character, there are a lot of character specific puzzles -- although it's usually not too hard to figure out which character to use since each only has one distinguishing ability.    They all have some form of jump, attack, and jumping attack. SpongeBob specializes in hitting objects above him (he uses his bubble blowing skills to make a head butting helmet), Patrick can throw fruit or robots at far away switches and freeze goo (the underwater equivalent of water), and Sandy can glide over long distances or grapple onto objects with her Texas-bred lassoing skills.    As you progress through the game, you'll run across several, completely random, mini-games -- SpongeBob can turn into a SpongeBall for swift maneuvering through tight spots, there's bubble bowling bubbles, tongue, body, and clam surfing, and bungee jumping (via the elastic band of SpongeBob's tighty whities).   The real downfall of this title is that you don't ever feel challenged. You never feel stuck or spend time thinking about how to get past an obstacle. If you somehow manage to die, you aren't penalized. You'll simply restart at the last checkpoint -- and there's a good chance you'll be able to warp to your last location via a teleporting cardboard box. It doesn't do anything new -- and its base gameplay is very generic. Battle for Bikini Bottom wouldn't be much of a game if it weren't for the license.   However, this doesn't mean SpongeBob isn't fun, but you'll probably have to be a fan of the absorbent lead character to get the most enjoyment from this title. If you are a fan, you'll be happy to know this one of the best uses of the SpongeBob license (or a license in general) -- thanks to the development team's love for the series. Everything about the title just reeks of SpongeBob. Instead of just slapping SpongeBob characters into a platformer, Iron Heavy Studios put a lot of small touches into this title that really capture the essence of the property.    The admiral's hand returns fallen character to their last check point. Near a TV and you'll hear the announcer fish give reports on the current robot crisis. Some bots carry sledgehammers made out of ham while others have back packs equipped with steaming tartar sauce. The battle with the King Jellyfish occurs in a giant shower. Your health is in the form of square underwear -- which is accompanied by great phrases like SpongeBob's ~Now I get to wear four pairs of underwear!~ or Patrick's, ~I don't think SpongeBob's underwear fits quite right.~ So many of the game's peculiarities reference particular episodes like the tongue and clam boarding is pulled directly from the episode about Sandy's hibernation (among others). The bungee jumping references ~hooking.~    You'll even see SpongeBob shrivel up into a dehydrated Sponge when he visits Sandy in the Tree Dome. Instead of just capitalizing off this popular franchise, Battle for Bikini Bottom is like an interactive extension of the cartoon.   Graphics  Heavy Iron Studios did a great job translating the show's style into a game. Although they didn't take the cel-shaded route -- environments still look incredibly SpongeBob-ian, even if the presentation is different. Characters have also made this 3D transition and most look pretty good, although SpongeBob (who, for some reason, has cel-shaded pants) has the same appeal as Homer Simpson in 3D. It just looks odd.   While textures are fairly simple -- wood has little more than a cartoon's worth of grain and some objects are a little too angular -- a lot of small touches make up for occasional detail scarcity. There are still flower-like objects in the sky, some of the trees have been toilet-papered, and when you're wandering through downtown Bikini Bottom you'll see SpongeBob's, Patrick's, and Sandy's clothing hanging out to dry.    The character animations capture the spirit of their cartoon counterparts. SpongeBob can switch on the fly from gaily prancing about to creeping on his tiptoes. Patrick maintains his lumbering gait, and you're treated to tidal waves of flubber if he belly flops. The most amusing event in the game is SpongeBob's dehydration in the Tree Dome -- you can watch as he withers from dehydration and runs around pathetically (it looks really cool and scary at the same time). Even idle animations have a lot of variety since SpongeBob will stick out his tongue and dance around or you can watch Patrick nervously glance behind him.    While there are some unsettling visuals -- like SpongeBob's 3D appearance or the angularity of certain structures, the style of the show is accurately captured.    Sound  The aural experience matches the rest of the game's presentation -- and for the most part they got it right. Besides for playing the theme song during the initial load, SpongeBob uses a lot of music directly from the actual episodes. What isn't immediately recognizable as show music is a subtle variation of the main theme (sans lyrics). However, there isn't enough variation, which makes you sick of the score.   Sound effects are excellent, and a lot has been borrowed from the cartoon. SpongeBob walks in squeaky steps or musical tiptoeing. Bubbles pop, robots clank and sputter, and the bouncy items make springy noises. Walk past goo-falls and you'll hear the loud gush of goo (or water) or while you're at the Goo Lagoon you'll hear the gentle lapping of goo against the shores.    The voice acting, for the most part, is also good. THQ managed to acquire all the original voice talent, except for the guy behind Mr. Krabs, to work on the game. The dialogue, including one liners, is true to the characters and includes clips like Patrick praising a rock because he thinks it's talking to him or Mr. Krabs and Plankton smartly convincing the sponge to do favors for them. The delivery of the lines themselves retains the same energy from the show, except for Squidward and Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs is understandable since it's a sound alike (although a bad one), but Squidward's voice just sounds robotic and uninspired (even though that's part of Squidward's character).    The love for the SpongeBob franchise really shines through in Battle for Bikini Bottom -- and if it weren't there this would be a very dreary title. I'm constantly amazed by the how much THQ and Heavy Iron got right -- this truly is like playing through an episode. While SpongeBob is a little too easy, it's still a lot of fun to romp through Jelly Fish fields or go clam boarding with Sandy. This game offers a lot of variety and each area feels like a fresh and distinct entity rather than just a palette swap.If you aren't a fan of SpongeBob, you'll probably find this a pretty average experience. However, if you're one who can get passed the bright colors and accept that this isn't an overly challenging, platformer revolutionizing title -- you can have more fun than a double overtime shift at the Krusty Krab.", "date": "Oct 29, 2003"}
