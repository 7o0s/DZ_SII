But whether it's the power of the system, the limitation of the cartridge format, or simply the fact that the GBA doesn't get nearly the same development attention as the console big boys, Grand Theft Auto isn't quite as drop-dead amazing as the titles that ship on the PlayStation 2. But as its own game, by itself, it's a solid driving game that successfully pulls many of the great ideas from the console world and sandwiches and shrinks them down on the portable system. Some slight, nitpicky flaws mar the handheld experience but overall Rockstar's successful in its attempt to recreate the fun, frantic, and violent experience for gamers on the run. Features More than 300 missions Cartridge save (three slots)  Rockstar is definitely on a roll on the Game Boy Advance. Though the company is very, very choosy what it brings to the handheld, every game it's brought to the system has been portable gold. Duke Nukem Advance: awesome. Max Payne: awesome. And now, Grand Theft Auto. Not quite as awesome as the company's previous two titles, but great nonetheless and definitely a recommended GBA outing. But only if you're of the ~mature~ mindset.  It's not like the game didn't have a lot of time to be good. It was originally announced for release back in 2001, but didn't manage to get out of its development limbo until this year. It leapt from developer to developer during this time, with Rockstar finally settling on Game Boy veterans Digital Eclipse for the first handheld rendition of the series since the crappy Game Boy originals back in 2000.  The team's made a variety of impressions on the Game Boy Advance, but Grand Theft Auto is by far Digital Eclipse's most ambitious title on the handheld, both technically and in game design. Grand Theft Auto definitely takes full advantage of the Mature rating emblazoned on the very low-key package art. The game design at its core couldn't get away with anything less. I mean, Grand Theft Auto literally encourages gamers to carjack any vehicle they can get their grubby mitts on and drive away, sometimes on pedestrian-laden sidewalks where anyone in the way becomes gooified red remains on the concrete. If vehicular manslaughter isn't enough, there's plenty of other things to get out your roadrage on anyone who's dumb enough to wander too close. Shotguns for close-range killing, Molotov cocktails for scorching the pavement. Flame throwers to torch citizens and gangmembers like marshmallows. There are even rocket launchers, grenades, machine guns...and yes, the all-powerful tank makes an appearance too.  Many people -- mostly outsiders -- assume that it's the game's over-the-top violence that makes the Grand Theft Auto such a success. Not a chance. Many games have tried to one-up the GTA's gory, gritty, and somewhat unnecessary gratuitous violence with their own take, and failed because of one key factor: the violence isn't the main reason why GTA is fun to play. The open-ended gameplay; Grand Theft Auto offers a go anywhere and do anything design that frees up a lot of restrictions. And even though the game can't be completed without following the linear mission structure, players can simply do what they want without any penalty. Unless, of course, they die or get caught doing it.  The game's plot is actually a side-story that takes place in Grand Theft Auto III's timeless world of Liberty City. Mike, the player's persona, has a problem: his partner in crime -- or rather, his partner to get out of crime -- has been taken out. And now, as a suspect in the assassination, Mike's running low into Liberty City's underground to unravel the mystery of who capped his buddy. Each mission brings him a step closer to the killer, and ultimately, that person's revenge. The tale's actually told via still cutscenes using artwork based on the style already established in the GTA series, and while the talking heads don't really animate other than sliding into view, at least you get a good idea of each character's personality thanks to the well-written dialogue.   Missions essentially require players to have a firm grasp on carjacking and driving, and half the fun is experimenting with the huge assortment of vehicles in Grand Theft Auto. Each car, truck, van, and bus has its own speed, handling and strength, so early in the game it's a good idea to understand the pros and cons of each four-wheeled vehicle before you set out for some long distance driving. The game's driving engine is surprisingly tight and responsive, with a great feeling of speed and weight for the dozens of vehicles. Cars and trucks can indeed flip over if you're too hard on the power break to slide around corners -- some are more sensitive than others in this respect, and it definitely adds to the gameplay when you actually have to be careful while racing around town.  Apart from the driving, missions tend to vary from simply being a deliveryman, to actually getting out of the car and blasting with whatever weapon you've jacked from dead gang members or purchased at the Ammu-Nation shop. Outside of the storyline, there are plenty of side-quests you can do to increase your bank account. Jack a taxi and drive citizens around town for some cash. Steal a firetruck or ambulance and save some lives. Grab a police vehicle and zoom around town vigilante-style to stop crime as it happens. Or, find the phonebooth and hit the streets in some races.  I think that's the one hard disappointment about Grand Theft Auto: the racing missions, completely optional and separate from the main storyline, are simply ~race through the gates before time runs out~ style of challenges. There aren't any ~race computer opponents and come in first~ designs of the console game. The ~race through the gates~ challenges definitely get tougher the deeper in the game you get, since most of these races have the added difficulty of dealing with enemy vehicles on a collision course to try and stop you from finishing in time. But in a game where you can drive anywhere, it would definitely had worked to the game's design had there been some actual races that took advantage of the city street designs.  But what's really great about this game: The weapon combat in Grand Theft Auto has been handled wonderfully on the Game Boy Advance, and really improves on the way the original two GTA games handled this element. In the PlayStation originals, the player's character actually controlled like every other vehicle in the game. For the GBA, the players have far more direct control over the character; up is up, down is down, left and right is, you guessed it, left and right. Players can lock the character to face one direction with the shoulder button, which gives the familiar strafing control for weapon attacks. Digital Eclipse's GTA has far better on-foot control than the past 2D GTA games, no question.  The city behavior in the GBA game is definitely more lenient than the console designs. It won't, for example, automatically raise your wanted level if you accidentally side-swipe a cop. Do it twice though, and the force will be after you. Kill a cop, and you'll raise the wanted level so high the SWAT team will put up roadblocks. Reducing the wanted level to zero is a simple matter of driving to the Paint Shop to hide from the cops, even if there was a roadblock sitting right in front of the building the second you drove into it. But don't think this makes the game any less challenging. Once you get to the second and third islands, nearly every pedestrian is as aggressive as any gang member or cop, and some of the later missions are really tough to pass without dying three or four times before.  To actually get the game running on the Game Boy Advance's more 2D-friendly hardware, Digital Eclipse more worked under the restrictions of the first two Grand Theft Auto games for its environments. Though development teams have proven that 3D is certainly possible on the handheld, it does tend to wreak havoc on playable framerates, so the return to the top-down environment for the graphics engine isn't all that surprising. And even though the game's a strict 2D design on the GBA, Grand Theft Auto does still employ some 3D effects to make the cities come alive on the handheld screen. Buildings jut upwards towards the camera and move in perspective, for example, and keen eyes can see little references made on the sides of buildings. Vehicles rotate thanks to the GBA's sprite abilities, and what's more, they ~lean~ into turns via sprite animations to give them a real sense of weight. And, as mentioned above, vehicles can definitely tip over, either by a hard turn or when hit broadside by another vehicle. Jumps do appear in the game, but they're more used for shortcuts than they are for ~yeeeee-haw!~ effect, and the game's statistics screen doesn't really keep track of any airtime.   The stats screen does, however, keep track of a lot of in-game data, just like the GTA big brothers. How far in the game players have completed, how many miles they've walked or driven, how many times they've been caught by the cops, how many missions they've accomplished, how many hidden packages have been discovered. And on and on. Why the designer had to use such a MASSIVE FONT for the statistics screen makes almost no sense, because players have to scroll through a long list of text just to see most of the data that can't fit on-screen. The in-cartridge save RAM keeps track of a lot of data, including the current progress so that players can return later. It is a drag that there's only one place per city to save the game, because players have to drive all the way to the hideout just so they can save and turn off the system. And players can't save within a mission either, which sort of works against the on-the-fly, quick-shot gaming nature of the Game Boy.  Digital Eclipse's technology used for the Game Boy is indeed impressive, but it does tend to get just a little framey depending on how complex the city gets and how many vehicles and pedestrians happen to get in the area. The average framerate is definitely smooth and playable enough, but be prepared for some chuggy moments deeper in the adventure. The artwork used for vehicles, pedestrians, and buildings may not look like anything special in still screens, but in motion and in context the game looks very nice on the GBA. There are some really great touches to the animation; walk over dead bodies and your character will leave bloody footprints for a few steps.  Other elements from the GTA series mimicked in the GBA game: different ~radio stations,~ or rather, different songs for the variety of vehicles in the game. A CB radio to hear dispatch report on happenings as you make them happen; it's so accurate the voice call out the color of your vehicle as well as the part of town you happen to be in. Unfortunately, even though the game has an on-screen map, it only shows a portion of the city. There's no way to pull up the full view of the city, which makes it difficult to find items that might not be automatically marked, like the hospital to increase health. And the included, printed map included in the box isn't a good substitute, since chances are you won't be willing to whip out the folded paper to seek out the specific location.  As great as the final product ended up, be cautious of a few bugs that have managed to slip through. Little minor elements include Taxi locations that may be positioned in places that can only be accessed on foot. Or missions that end abruptly because it thought you triggered something that caused a ~failed mission~ flag. Vehicles will occasionally get latched against building sides if you drive too fast into them, or angle into them too oddly. But of all the problems, I haven't experienced anything as annoying as the original PlayStation versions' habit of getting locked in a car when too close to a building. Even with the blemishes Grand Theft Auto is a surprisingly fun and extensive game on the Game Boy Advance. The portable rendition retains much of what has made the series, starting with Grand Theft Auto III such a success on the PlayStation 2, and it's clear that Digital Eclipse understood the idea of the series...even in its 2D design. It's definitely one the most ambitious games created on the Game Boy Advance.I have no problem admitting that I thought that the original Grand Theft Auto and its sequel sucked; they were boring games on the PlayStation, and it was only when the series moved to 3D on the PlayStation 2 with Grand Theft Auto III that I really appreciated what the series had to offer. This 2D Game Boy Advance design, at the very least, vastly improves on the originals, and fixes the game so much that it's now a great, recommended action title. It was definitely worth the long wait.", "date": "Oct 26, 2004"}
