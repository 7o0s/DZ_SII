Chances are that nearly everyone of them will step forward.  In the case of Europeans, though, American football just won't cut it.  Nope, it takes good ol' regular football (known as soccer Stateside) to entertain most European blokes.  Enter Uefa Striker. With no other soccer games on the horizon for Sega's machine, British developer Rage has been given the perfect opportunity to further establish their brand in what is usually an overcrowded genre.  We were so eager to test out this next generation soccer title, that we couldn't wait for its U.S. debut, set for February 2000 under the name Striker Pro 2000.  So, we imported the game straight out of Europe, and, upon starting up, were surprisingly greeted by nothing more than a title screen!  In terms of presentation, Striker certainly isn't a lavish affair, offering anything but a vast array of pointless options to confuse you with. However, as soccer games go, this one has just enough to keep fans happy, sporting all the important modes that we've come to expect.  The European Championship is available to play, as is the European Champions League and World Cup, although the latter two are cunningly disguised due to the rights belonging to other game companies. The Classic Match option is a welcome addition, allowing you to recreate actual games from the past. As for the teams themselves, legal rights have once again prohibited Rage from using the actual names. However, you won't have to play as Munchaster United, as the developers have named all the clubs after their area of origin.  Using Barcelona is all well and good, but if you wish to play as Arsenal, you'll  need a good knowledge of the Premiership in order to figure out that it's actually Highbury you should be looking for!  Fortunately though, there's an editing system, allowing you to put in the correct team names and even create eight of your own custom teams. Formations, tactics, weather and camera positions can also be dabbled with, catering to hardcore fans. Speaking of which, the training mode will definitely impress, taking you to the team's exclusive and luxurious club where you can practice your shooting techniques, penalties, set-pieces and corners to name but a few.  If ever you needed to brush-up on your skills, this is the ideal place to do so. Should you jump straight into one of the championship modes or a friendly, one of the first things you'll notice is the commentary. Provided by Jonathon Pearce, Ron Atkinson and Ruud Gullit, the trio work reasonably well, adding depth and atmosphere to the proceedings.  Graphically, this has to be the best looking soccer game I've ever played. However, I can't help but feel a little let down. The stadiums are perfectly replicated, the players look the part, and everything is nice and pretty, but I was expecting to be more blown away by a next-generation soccer title. If you're not looking for a visual fest though, you won't be in the least bit disappointed, as Striker is both clear and refreshingly detailed.   The control system used is simple, but efficient. To my dismay, there's no powerbar allowing you to decide the strength of your shots, so you'll have to rely on the more mandatory pass and shoot buttons to get you through a match. The all important tackling is there, but is rather messy at times. Thankfully though, the trap function places you directly in the path of an incoming ball, letting you retrieve it with ease.  Striker may appear daunting at first, but after a good hour or two of practice, you'll be able to put some very strong moves together due to a powerful and flexible passing system that's well worth mastering.   Overall, Uefa Striker is an entertaining and decent soccer game, which lacks  the arcade-style gameplay and graphics of Virtua Striker. The game tries very hard to be the best, and almost manages it. If only Rage had spent more time on the visuals and control system, they would have had the definitive football title on their hands. With the aforementioned Virtua Striker in development, I can't help but feel that only serious fans will be left completely satisfied with what Uefa has to offer.   -- Matthew Langan, IGNDC", "date": "Oct 28, 1999"}
