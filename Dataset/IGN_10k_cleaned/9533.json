This is a licensed title based on a game about breeding and farming that was turned into a cartoon series and then manipulated by Microsoft to almost single-handedly support the kids and family category on store shelves for the Xbox 360. The end result? Viva Pinata: Party Animals reeks of senseless sell-out game design; the minigames are dull, strange and mostly rehashed, the witty banter isn't and you'll have played through most of what the game offers inside of three hours - or less. You'd have to be a very young kid, extraordinarily dedicated Viva Pinata fans or the definition of a 'casual gamer' to think this game was worth even the bargain price it is being sold at. Viva Pinata: Party Animals is like a warm glass of water - it'll do the job in a pinch, but why would you bother?   If we sound unnecessarily harsh, understand that we truly went into Party Animals with an open mind. We really like our Mario Party games and multiplayer fun in general - we were quietly optimistic when Australian developer, Krome, was announced as the developer. See, Krome, of Spyro and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger fame, know how to do kids games. Mostly, they're harmless fun with a decent sense of humour and solid variety. Oddly enough, Party Animals is devoid of most of these critical elements.   What's the point of all this head-to-head animal rivalry? The introductory cutscene explains that the game is about - get this - a competitive in-game television show for pinatas, which itself is based on a 4Kids Entertainment television show about pinatas, based on a game in real life. Confused? You haven't started playing yet.      Suddenly, you're racing around Pinata Island between every three minigames; each race ferries you from one set of events to the next, while netting you between 9 and 2 points, depending on how you place. These races are sadly the most interesting part of the game. They're done on a continuous rally-style course from one end to the other and feature designs reminiscent of Diddy Kong Racing, if vastly simplified and not circular. These also make the most the of the graphics engine that Rare lent Krome - though, some levels like the beach and snowy villages were obviously original designs. The draw distance and sense of speed are good, but each of the eight possible pinata racers all handle the same way, the weapons are a mixed bag of useful (butterfly wings, booster rockets, screen slimers and offensive rockets) lousy (flash bombs, useless honey-pot slicks and size-increasers) and just plain baffling (what the heck do those sunflowers do?).    Unfortunately, the races aren't timed and there's very little sense of accomplishment. Plus, even when the AI is set to keeping the competition 'close', it generally stays a fair distance behind you throughout the race, only to pip you at the line on occasion, which is frustrating. The AI in the rest of the game remains mostly uncompetitive; they meander over to spilled candy, lazily bumping each other out of the way or putting in the minimum amount of effort like hypoglycaemic kid in need of a sugar fix.    In games requiring counting skills or hand-eye coordination, they fare even worse - you can triple or even quadruple their score with any amount of effort. Clearly, this game goes out of its way to let you win. This even extends to the first couple hundred Achievement points that are practically given away just for competing. At the end of the very first race in the very first session with the game, we unlocked four achievements. We subsequently unlocked another six by the end of the first 'long' session.   The most fun to be gained, then, is in multiplayer. Even then, you'll want four players under the age of 9 and a lot of junk food to make this a viable party option. The games themselves are mostly clones of Mario Party and Fusion Frenzy games, with new takes on Hot Potato and Pin the Tail on the Donkey amongst others.   She's not laughing. She's screaming.  Visually, there are moments when the game looks lovely and lush, but it lacks a lot of the subtlety that comes with watching the slower paced original game. The freshly designed elements hold true to the textural, papery themes, but minigames and levels look like they need an injection of polygons sometimes.   The audio - particularly the commentators and characters themselves - are pretty irritating. They cycle through the same half a dozen phrases, cracking unfunny jokes that would garner a grimace from a 6 year old, let alone a 20-something. Sure, it's all based around the TV series, but why mimic a source that's already horribly flawed to begin with?   The simple answer likely is, Microsoft and Rare (and probably 4Kids too) got involved with the design process from early on, keeping the direction in tune with what they think the demographic wants. News flash: the demographic wants gameplay and direction, not goofy voices and unlockable artwork. Instead, what we have here are 30-odd games, many of which are versions of the same minigames, with very little tangible structure, very few options, no choice to freely select unlocked minigames (something that even the original Mario Party had), a bare-bones multiplayer and online experience.   Make no mistake - you will find some games more tolerable than others - all are playable (insofar as they are able to be played), none are memorable or interesting. To be bluntly honest, we think that today's discerning and informed child is going to be able to tell the difference between a quick cash-in game like this and a quality release like the original product - but will the parents?
