This game is its own design by Codemasters; the game is technique-based where you must learn to punch, jab and block strategically, staying one or more moves ahead of your opponent in order to put him flat out on the mat. Unfortunately, despite a few good merits in its design, this game isn't a whole lot of fun to play. Features Four gameplay modes 16 different rings Battery save (two slots) Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance Virtucraft Ltd. was the team responsible for bringing the Codemasters/UbiSoft boxing design to life on the Game Boy Advance. Technically, the game's pretty impressive, with a 3D rotating ring that moves with a defined smoothness using the GBA's scaling and rotation hardware. The textures used for the ring's mat are high resolution and don't have that usual pixelation when using the ~Mode 7~ style technique. The ropes around the mat further enhance the feeling of 3D, since they move in perspective as the camera spins around to follow the action.  But as good as the game looks, it can't hide the underwhelming gameplay. Mike Tyson Boxing on the Game Boy Advance is not very satisfying to play...bordering on dull and boring. Sure, you've got the standard array of different punches at your disposal, from jabs to roundhouses to uppercuts...but the game's limiting perspective and overuse of the blocking make it a downright rarity to actually connect the hits to the opponent. And in all honesty, half the fun of boxing is actually hitting the other guy...right? The somewhat clumsy control interface doesn't help much, since it uses a strange combination of A and B, and L and R buttons to pull off an uppercut. The printed manual absolutely no help, as it doesn't explain any of the on-screen indicators...I still haven't quite figured out what the two power bars at the top of the screen represent, nor do I know what the little power bars in the corner do, nor have I discovered exactly what the tiny icons in the upper corners of the screen symbolize. This game seriously needed an in-game training mode to explain how to actually play the game; Mike Tyson Boxing's practice mode does nothing but let you throw punches without worrying about hurting any statistics. The game does support link cable, and it does enhance the fun...a bit. Even with a human opponent, though, the fights are still bland and boring, with most of those punches whizzing in the air without any contact.  The manual does focus on the game's career mode, and it's obvious that's where most of the game design focus went, too. Players can create a boxer from scratch, name him, train him, and work him up the ladder of boxers week after week. His performance is based on how you manage his training routines; do you have him skip rope the most? Or have him hit the heavy bag? The progress is charted by a handy line graph that represents his performance...and his training is definitely felt in the actual fights, as if you totally screw up his training, he'll control all slow and logey in the ring. But without a fun boxing engine, this deep, detailed training mode isn't worth the effort.  And even though I praised the technical aspect of Mike Tyson Boxing, there are some issues with graphics...most notably in the character representations of the boxers. Now, most of the fighters in this title are fictional, but you can play as or box against Mike Tyson himself...and the guy's videogame representation honestly looks nothing like his real-life counterpart. Mike Tyson Boxing is a decent-looking dull Game Boy Advance game. Even though it's got a good game engine with a deep training mode, the actual gameplay doesn't have any real fun or excitement to it. And with other boxing titles hitting the GBA arena from Majesco (Boxing Fever), Acclaim (Punch King), and even the currently unsigned Sadistic Boxing, Tyson's a lightweight in comparison.", "date": "Mar 12, 2002"}
