Humanity's made a wasteland of the Earth, a wasteland that's now filled with hundreds of mutants and robots and it's up to you to clean it all up. That's the basic premise behind Restricted Area, a new game inspired by the mechanics of Diablo and the setting of Fallout. Sadly, Restricted Area falls far short of the games that inspired it and winds up being at once both completely predictable and almost wholly unexciting.  In keeping with the unsurprising cyberpunk style of the game, Restricted Area offers up four characters who are little more than stereotypes. There's the gruff, trenchcoat-wearing firearms expert; the shirtless Asian martial arts hero; a gigantically-boobed psionicist (read: spellcaster) and a hacker with a pet droid. The only concession to originality here is that the hacker character is actually attractive. While this makes the game very easy to understand, it also means that you'll be playing a caricature more than a real character.  Luckily the RPG elements of this game allow for tremendous development. The skill system is almost entirely unique for each character, meaning you can shape their abilities to suit your playing style. Just because you're playing a character who's into firearms combat doesn't mean that there aren't a dozen different directions to build on that basic skill. Even better, the small increases to skills will offer immediate and obvious improvements to your abilities in the game. A 10% increase in evasion might not sound like much on paper, but it soon makes a noticeable difference in combat. This makes gaining new levels a real event in and of themselves as opposed to making them small stepping-stones towards a larger goal.  As with Diablo, there's a ton of loot here that you can pick up and use. Beyond the weapons, which come in a sizeable variety of types and abilities, there are also biotech implants that you can install to boost any number of performance areas, from healing to reflexes. Strangely, you can switch out these implants pretty much at will, even in the middle of a mission. Taking a few seconds to replace your eye or an entire arm seems a little incongruous, particularly when your main mission hub includes a doctor who's supposed to specialize in this type of crap. Unfortunately, none of these cool bio-implants show up on your character sprite. I'd have loved to see my character get a big robotic arm or something.   Where Diablo rewarded you with new environments and Fallout rewarded you with an advancing story, the accumulation of new skills and equipment is pretty much the only lasting reward for playing this game. The levels and enemies are interesting enough at the start, but once the fat mutants and dark, purposeless rooms (which seem to exist only so the fat mutants have somewhere to wait for you) start to show up again and again, they tend to get a little stale, particularly once you start undertaking the optional submissions that you'll need in order to stay ahead of the game's challenge curve.  One thing that might have helped ease the monotony of the gameplay (or at least distract us from it) would be the inclusion of a really interesting story. Sadly, Restricted Area recycles the same apocalyptic pap we've been dining on for years. Humanity screwed up, the world's now a wasteland inhabited by mutants and robots, giant corporations are the real organizing forces but they've got sinister motives, and so on. You're a mercenary who's been employed to complete tasks within the framework of these corporate rivalries but none of it ever really manages to seem compelling. It was nice that the other characters you're not playing show up during the course of the game but the whole point of the game still seems largely an afterthought.  Once you start the game you'll find yourself in a sort of urbanized hub that will become your base. Here you'll find a few merchants, a contact who gives you jobs, a pilot to take you on your missions, and a few other useful folks. There's even a prostitute here but, for some reason, you're not allowed to have sex with her. (Are you sure this is a German game?) The addition of a pilot to ferry you back and forth to your mission is a real welcome convenience as it lets you get right to the action without a lot of repetitive running back and forth. Sadly the missions themselves involve killing everything you run across and that does get repetitive.      Combat is as much of a clickfest as Diablo ever was but without the wider range of special abilities of Blizzard's game. When you engage in combat in Restricted Area you'll basically be hitting the attack button again and again with the occasional tap on the medpack key. It's not helped that the monsters are relatively unintelligent. They run towards you with such single-mindedness that they frequently find themselves hung up on the environment. In fact, trying to get your enemies snagged on doorways, crates and barrels becomes a little tactical game in itself. Even boss monsters can find their entire plan of attack foiled the instant you can get a sizeable piece of furniture between the two of you. You'll have your own pathfinding woes from time to time, requiring you to actually lead your character around even the most negligible of obstacles.  The graphics do have some nice touches. I quite like the shotgun shells that fly out as you fire, and I think the bloody spew that you make of your enemies adds a real visceral excitement to combat. As an added treat, the mouse cursor also functions as a flashlight, which means you can light up small areas of the level as you move around. I quite like that the levels are so well detailed, but the overabundance of items and objects on the floors and on the walls does start to get distracting in the more confined levels. Unfortunately, some of the layers are also off, so you'll occasionally see sprites in front of or behind objects they shouldn't be. When enemies are shooting at you, you'll often see their projectiles emerge not from the gun they're holding, but from several feet off to their side.  The rest of the presentation is mostly passable. The game's soundtrack sounds like a bad acid trip at a Metallica concert and the voice acting still has some minor but distracting ESL issues. (The frequent typos should have been fixed by the publisher at least.) The better part of the game's sound are found during combat. While not wholly realistic (or even believable), the sounds of fighting in this game definitely lend a little more weight to the experience.   Multiplayer is included but only for direct connects and then only for the random missions. A cooperative mode might have made the game a bit more enjoyable.   Ten years ago, the gaming world would have been impressed with Restricted Area. Sadly, the game's content and visuals just can't compete with the few other action RPGs that you can find on store shelves. The only reasons a gamer would prefer this game over the other more enjoyable selections out there are either 1) they don't have a computer powerful enough to run Dungeon Siege or 2) they just can't find a copy of Fallout. I tend to think I'd be a lot more understanding if Restricted Area weren't carrying that forty-dollar price tag.", "date": "Jun 28, 2005"}
