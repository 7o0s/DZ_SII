Having been assured by folks in the know that the series would begin to offer progressively tougher puzzles and more madcap humor, we can't help but feel a little let down by this third installment. The puzzles are much easier this time around and the story is just too short to give the writers room to explore its potential.  In all, the basic concept of the humor is definitely better this time around and more in keeping with the chaotic, screwy approach you'd expect from Sam and Max. Rather than poking fun at self-help gurus and TV shows, this time around the story centers on Sam and Max's search for a missing police informant at Ted E. Bear's Mafia-Free Casino. The fact that this ostensibly family-friendly casino is definitely not a front for the mob couldn't be clearer. Sure, the employees wear pinstripe suits and porkpie hats, but they also sport comical, oversized bear heads that virtually scream ~I am most assuredly not a Mafia hitman disguised as a comical bear!~ While the promise of the premise is a bit better than the eventual payoff, it's nice to see the writers turning their attention towards humor that's not quite so obvious.    The dialogue here has definitely improved since the last two installments. The Ted E. Bear song is quite possibly the funniest moment in the series so far. Still, there are some tiresome gags, particularly the lengthy ~yo' mama~ segment and the recurring ~does the carpet match the drapes?~ routine. It also appears that the monthly delivery of an entirely new adventure has forced the writers to recycle not just jokes but also ideas. For instance, Bosco has another crazy accent in this one, another outrageous security system and a ridiculously silly and expensive item that you'll have to obtain.  We really like the new characters, both the Mafia-types and the cheating gambler with the brilliant name of Leonard Steakcharmer. We especially liked the ~organic listening device~ (a literal ~bug~) who is haunted by memories of Vietnam. Bosco's new French persona allows for some nice bits but it's not as consistently funny as his British disguise from the previous episode. Sybil's got a new job as well, but she's not even in the episode long enough for you to notice.  The shortness of the episode is really one of the biggest strikes against it. We managed to finish this one in a little less than an hour and a half. There are fewer puzzles this time around and virtually no confusion about what you're supposed to do next. If you've finished the previous episodes, you may even find yourself a step ahead of a few puzzles since the solutions rely on some of the same gimmicks. Even the more original puzzles simply require you to try using the few items in your inventory on the few usable objects in each scene. Sometimes the solution is so obvious, you wonder if the designers are even trying to challenge the players.   The inevitable driving sequence still leaves a lot to be desired. While there's no reason to turn Sam and Max into an action game, the controls for the driving portion of the game are still clumsy and unsatisfying. On the plus side, there's a new Whack da Ratz game that not only offers a pleasant little action diversion, but also hearkens back to the original Sam and Max game.      There are only three new locations here (all in the casino) and they don't offer quite as much interactivity as the more familiar locations of Sam and Max's office, Bosco's or Sybil's. Those three old areas (and the street where they live) all use the same gags that we've seen before -- an unfinished game of darts, a decidedly unrelaxing sign and some questionable condiments. While the jokes are genuinely funny, it's all stuff we've seen before...twice. The new places definitely have some cool items of interest, but there's just not enough new content here to fill out an entire episode.  We're also a bit discouraged that the series hasn't really started to tie itself together into a coherent story. Admittedly, coherence isn't exactly in keeping with Sam and Max, but there's just not enough of a connection from one episode to the next for there to be any real payoff. While it allows new players to jump in and start playing the current episode, it doesn't reward the investment that other players have made in the first two episodes. Sure, sure, we've seen the Hypno-Bear before, but there's very little sense of building momentum or meaning from one episode to the next.   In terms of interface and overall presentation, this new Sam and Max episode maintains the standard already set for the series. Your interaction with the world is incredibly intuitive and convenient. The camera issues from the first episode aren't a problem anymore either.  The series' high level of visuals and sounds has also been preserved. Sam and Max and the old locations look just as good as ever, and the new character designs and new scenes fit into the world beautifully. The casino set isn't as detailed or busy as the TV studio from the second episode, but it has some nice elements to explore.  The voice acting is even better this time around, both in terms of Sam and Max and the new characters. The Mafia guys hit just the right tone for their roles and the Godfather character is absolutely inspired. On the downside, Bosco's new French accent pales in comparison to his British accent from the previous game.   While the humor is a bit better, this is definitely the weakest episode in the series owing to its uncomplicated puzzles and short length. Fans of the series will definitely still want to play it, just to soak up every bit of Sam and Max as possible, but the rest of the world probably won't find much point in purchasing and playing this episode separately. Gamers with Gametap subscriptions or the whole season package will definitely appreciate the humor here but the gameplay still leaves a lot to be desired. With the second and third episodes each declining in quality, we hope that the team can inject a little more fun into the series while still keeping up with the monthly schedule.", "date": "Feb 5, 2007"}
