The look, feel, and action in Blast Radius are all very similar to the gameplay in Colony Wars. But what sets this game apart from Psygnosis' other space combat game is its straight-forwardness. This game is for gamers who simply want to just jump in and blow up a bunch of spaceships. Graphics   The style in Blast Radius is very, very similar to Colony Wars. It features the same vibrant textures, smooth framerate, and very slick lightsourcing. I wouldn't exactly put it up there with the sequel, but Blast Radius' imagery is very slick.  When you fire a laser bolt or missile, you're treated to gratuitous lens-flare effects. Heck, even the plasma trails coming out of enemy ships cast a glow on the television screen. One thing's for sure, it doesn't skimp on the glitz. Sound Like every Psygnosis game in existence, Blast Radius features techno music. Lots and lots of techno music. Boy, there's an awful lot of techno music. And since this is a science-fiction game, you're treated to lots of  generic stereo blasts, thrusts, and explosions. Did I mention the techno music? Gameplay  Press the start button, and you're faced with the ultimate decision: which ship do you use to blast the enemy with? Up front, you've got a choice of four ships, each with its own speed, strength, and weapons ratings. Take your pick, and you're off into the wild black yonder.  While the game is broken into missions, there isn't any plot to weigh down your game playing. Just read the mission briefing (and you really don't even need to do that) and you're off. Most missions simply to take out enemy ships before they kill you  others require you to defend certain items while you're cruising the blackness of space.  However, the AI isn't really the smartest  if you're cruising head-on with an enemy fighter, he'll always break away at the last second  which gives you a clear advantage to simply tail the sucker and destroy him. And once you learn this little trick, many missions end up just being a basic game of chicken, and you already know who's going to chicken out first.  That isn't to say the game isn't a challenge  later in the game, some missions get downright nasty. You'll be pummeled on every side by enemy craft, and some of which you're not supposed to attack.   And there's also a two-player splitscreen option for one-on-one dogfighting. It's pretty good, but not nearly as energetic when you're attacked from every angle from enemy fighters. Overall Blast Radius is just a made-for-TV version of Colony Wars -- the developers hacked away the story and anything else that would get in the way of a straight-forward shooter. Sure, all the good stuff is here, but even Colony Wars had more clever weaponry and craft. I got more satisfaction out of Colony Wars than I did out of this game -- but if you're looking for a jump-in-quick action title, give this one a rent.", "date": "Feb 25, 1999"}
