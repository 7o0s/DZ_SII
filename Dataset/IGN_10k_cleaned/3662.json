Silent Hill 3 is a case in point. The religious themes explored throughout the storytelling paths are way ahead of the competition. Even when the stilted voice acting hampers the serious tone, the atmosphere is never in danger of being corny. The strength of Silent Hill 3 lies in its sparse but effective narration. Never are things explained in too much detail, nor should they be. A similar example is TV series The X-Files, which worked as long as we never saw the aliens properly or were fully explained as to how the conspiracy came about or worked.    Silent Hill 3 gives the player nuggets of information and glimpses of things best described as, uh, things. It never patronizes too much or ever makes things completely clear. It's designed for players to think for themselves and put things together for themselves. When one figures it all out, the result is extremely satisfying.    The third game is heavily focused on religion and beliefs. The plot is connected to the first game, which was laden with religious imagery and thoughts. Luckily, the game never forces any of its views on the player but, instead, it ponders about one's faith and the meaning of destiny. It's cultivating, intriguing stuff and it makes the game worthwhile.    When it comes to plot, the first few hours are sparse. Heather spends much of her time wandering around a creepy mall after having a Kafka-esque nightmare, in which the visual undertones and clever psychological references are noteworthy. After the mall sequence, the pace quickens and the story begins in earnest, the pieces of the puzzle being to fall in place, so to speak.   The beginning of the game is paced better, as is the game overall, especially when compared to Silent Hill 2. The action quotient has been ramped up. Or rather, if you want to get involved in fisticuffs, you can. There's more disgusting monster roaming around the locales than before. To dispatch these beasties, Heather can use several weapons such as an Uzi, Shotgun, Stungun and a nifty Katana.    The selection of offensive items is the greatest that's been offered in the series so far. There's more once you complete the game. During the approximately 10-14 hour quest, a few boss fights need dealing with, but for the most part, you can just opt to run around the monsters instead of fighting them.    The combat system in the past has been a bit clunky, but Konami's explanation is at least partially believable, which is that gamers are handling ordinary characters who unused to swinging great axes and the like. The close-quarters combat is highly improved. Strafing around enemies works very well. Despite the cramped nature of the areas, the combat isn't too frustrating.    There are a few areas where, due to darkness, you won't see an enemy until it has hit you. Usually these don't do enough to damage your explorative progress. Also, there are plenty of health kits around, while ammo is sparse.   If you like to think  The art of good puzzles is something of a dying art form in most modern games -- or at least until Tim Schaefer releases another adventure game. Silent Hill 3 has quite a few puzzles compared to the earlier games in the series. Luckily there are a good variety of puzzles and, in general, they are much improved. The beauty of the puzzles is that they fit impeccably into the game's structure.    More importantly, the solution to these puzzles is, with one notable exception, extremely logical. You seem to know the solution to each puzzle when you get to work on them. Usually the solution you have thought of, works. There's certainly a few puzzles based around numerics and riddles that you have to think about how to formulate the correct solution.    While all read articles and papers are stored into Heather's Notebook, it's nicely old school that some puzzles do require you to pick up a pen and a piece of paper (or perhaps my brain just wasn't powered up enough). Before you begin your adventure, you can choose from three different puzzle and action levels. The most basic puzzle level basically skips almost all puzzles, while the hardest level gives most of the hints to the puzzles in very cryptic rhymes. Which seems to be quite an artificial and easy way to ramp up the difficulty.   Visually Speaking  To be fair, much of the game's visual style is akin to what we've seen in the previous Silent Hill games, but somehow Konami has again outdone itself. Interior locations are highly detailed and imaginative in their imagery. The texture work is impeccable. Some of the new low-key effects such as pulsating walls dripping blood are excellent.    There's no CG this time; realtime cut-scenes are used instead. The character models faces are superbly modeled and animated, which make the characters feel extremely real. The animation is good but it's the variety of fleshy, ugly creatures in which Konami excels best. The filter effect smoothens a lot of the game's sharper edges and only occasionally gives it a bit of a low-res look.   There are a few sequences in the game that really make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Several scenes are simply chilling. In some, just as the main character, you have no idea what the hell is going on -- In a good way. One of Silent Hill 2's more memorable set pieces was the elevator in the hospital. The elevator stops and a '60s quiz show starts to blare from a non-existant speaker. It's difficult to convey the effectiveness of such a scene, but Silent Hill 3 has many of these. Somehow it all works.   Sonically Speaking  Akira Yamaoka's sound design is superb throughout. There's more music this time around and the minimalistic guitar-based songs work well. The constant audiovisual dread, however, is what gets to you the most. It's still the disturbingly creepy and constant sound effects that make you feel at unease. The audio scares never let down, you are constantly bombarded with screechy, thumping sounds that will make you want to turn the sound off. That's because the sound design is so good in the job it needs to do, not because it's bad.While the tone and design of the game are great, some parts of it -- such as the badly thought out menu systems -- seem as amateurish mistakes when the rest of the game is well put together. There are two different endings, which depend on the player's actions at the end of the game. Sure, we've seen much of this before in the series, but somehow the third game ends up being the most polished and tight gaming experience. The first game, with its fresh new take on horror games and Dark City-esque warping worlds, was perhaps a bit deeper, but overall Silent Hill 3 is the better all around package.", "date": "May 23, 2003"}
