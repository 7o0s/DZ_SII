Evil Prophecy has changed this belief -- our universe is upside-down and it's making us real sick. This game instills more violence into an otherwise kind soul than something purportedly wicked like Vice City ever could, and it has the added bonus of actually being able to make its players substantially stupider. In fact, after you complete Evil Prophecy -- assuming you're already stupid enough to do so, or are obligated to by a sadist of an employer like I was -- you'll be able to look down on your lap and visibly gauge the weight of lost brain that has rolled off your shirt after tumbling out of your ears. The chunks of thinking matter will twitch and pray for mercy, as most suffering things usually do moments before death.  Evil Prophecy is a sinister title. Like the devil, its greatest trick was pulling a veil over itself and feigning nondescript-ness. So devious is Evil Prophecy that its McFarlane branded stamp has somehow managed to cloak the many overtly dumb, incredibly easy, impressively boring, utterly lifeless, and awfully wretched qualities of the game.  Oh, how I love me some Evil Prophecy -- not for its lack of solidity, negative ~fun factor~ (to be measured by a series of repulsively ecstatic caricatures resembling a dying donkey in varying states), nor for its unimaginably brown artwork, but rather for its unnatural ability to be completely and totally without worth. Oh yes, I find myself drawn to it. For the intellectual within each of us, Evil Prophecy could represent the first instance of tangible proof that black holes do exist. Such a life draining, light destroying void is this, I am forced to surmise someone, somewhere must have made a concerted effort to create the game so purposefully bad. Because of this deliberate attempt to fail so miserably, I must applaud.   I Am The Evil Prophecy!  There is a story present that should not be read and cannot be heard. Its text periodically oscillates across the screen, stabbing my eyes and coercing me to gather wood or bolster MP bars or get a monster card for some old jerk who blocks our path. It establishes a meaningless objective designed to tie together another sloppy chop-fest. Plodding is an understatement, unnecessary is a compliment. When it comes to the storyline, a simple ~bad thingies need sword in face~ would have sufficed. Why then do I need to see, ~There are a great number wolves and wolfmen near here. Their leader, the Werewolf, will be our first target.~ Yes, peachy. That means kill things. I am teh smart-o. Maybe the killing will be nice, eh? Maybe some kind of space manatee will fall from the heavens and kill me dead?  Nay! Miraculously, Evil Prophecy's action is worse than its story. The key to success is not to switch between the game's supposedly different but nearly identical characters who all lob unexciting special attacks of their own, but to sit around waiting for your computer controlled friends to finish the job, or to run in X button blazing and dispatch every foe without incurring a lick of damage. It's possible to complete many levels of Evil Prophecy without ever getting hit, which is a new form of videogaming challenge so enthralling and cutting edge we're all apparently unequipped to appreciate it.   Unlike Two Towers, Return of the King, Demon Stone, or a potato, Evil Prophecy has no style, no pumping music, no killer graphics, and no excuse for existing. If only I were in a position to decide the fate of games at milestones. I'd walk into the much dreaded Evil Prophecy meetings and ask ~Ahhhh, what are you guys doing?~ It's absurdly bad.   If no one is capable of answering a deep, philosophical question like ~What is your problem?~ maybe someone could simply tell me how there could be a bloody awful camera if there isn't a damn thing in the environment to make it bloody awful? I'd settle with an answer to that. Each level is brown, gray, and so sparsely populated the occasional crate is like a fistful of roses. It's unbelievable.   You know there's multiplayer, right? Too bad it's like picking up the head of a week-dead pigeon, commenting on its foul stench and then jamming it under the nose of a friend, urging him to smell, smell, smell it up real good.  I believe Jeremy summed up Evil Prophecy rather nicely when he said: ~Just the song in the menu and opening intro...that's what I like about that game -- about Evil Prophecy. That's the only redeemable quality in my opinion.~ Print that on the back of the ~greatest hits~ box.  Do not purchase Evil Prophecy. Do not rent it. Avert your eyes should it be demonstrated near you. And, if ever you meet a suicidal man, direct him to this article and assure him that things can always be worse.", "date": "Jun 17, 2004"}
