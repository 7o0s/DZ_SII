{"name": "King Arthur", "name_review": "King Arthur", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/20/king-arthur", "text": "Hollywood's latest take on the legendary Knights of the Round Table has come and gone to both subdued critical acclaim and box office results. The $90 million-budgeted movie, which starred Clive Owen and the gorgeous Keira Knightley, retold the famous tale with an emphasis on gritty realism. Big on swords, but slim on sorcery, in other words. The Konami-published game of the same name takes a similar approach. Gamers will be able to control Arthur himself, or one of four other key characters, and battle it out with armies of primitive enemies. The game definitely makes the best of a rather unimpressive movie license, seamlessly interspersing scenes from the film into cut-sequences, and the variety in gameplay types and environments is likewise well realized. That said, King Arthur is little more than a continuous ~hack-tion~ title and though developer Krome Studios has tried to mix things up with character upgrades and special moves, slicing and dicing opponents eventually grows repetitive.  The Facts  Based on the 2004 movie King Arthur Play out the Knights' final duties 20 minutes of clips from the movie help tell the story Become five different characters including King Arthur and Lancelot Three combat types: horseback fights, sword fights and archery 20 chapters and six environments based on areas from the motion picture Two-player cooperative mode   On Horse or on Foot King Arthur the videogame adheres to the storyline in the movie, specifically that the fictional legend is actually based on real events that transpired during the Dark Ages. The game is designed to be both gritty and in many ways realistic. Opening snippets from the movie tell the story of Arthur and his Knights, soldiers in the Roman Army charged to defend a Roman family from the Saxons. In-game and pre-rendered cut-scenes also help tell the tale throughout the adventure. The end result is a straightforward ~hack-tion~ title that at times reminds us of Electronic Arts' fast-paced Lord of the Rings games, and at other times of Gauntlet. And sure enough, King Arthur has its moments, but it also has its fair share of problems.  Players control one of five different characters including Arthur, Lancelot, Guinevere, Bors, and Tristan, each competently modeled after the actors in the feature film. These characters aren't just different looking, though; they also feature unique attributes. For instance, Arthur can wield a sword like none other, while Lancelot's skill on horseback is unchallenged and Guinevere can be brutal with long-range weapons like the bow and arrow. Furthermore, each person comes complete with his or her own special move and, on top of everything else, gamers can earn experience to improve their character's statistics, from speed to strength. For what is otherwise a fairly predictable action romp, these quasi-RPG elements go a long way to give gamers something to reach for, and as abilities are upgraded new moves become available, effectively creating a rewarding enhancement system.  The game dishes out a combination of three combat types: horseback fights, sword fights, and archery. While the locations change and the environments vary in design and beauty, the basic formula stays the same and it also begins to wear thin, which is our biggest complaint. Don't get us wrong, there's definitely some fun to be had here, especially in the game's cooperative mode. But players looking for a strategic or overly smart action offering will not find it. Rather, the goal is simply to fight off swarms of enemies and when they're done to fight off swarms more. And there's really not much more to it. Kill the enemy. Stay alive. Sounds simple, but neither is easy, especially as the game advances. This latter truth is made all the more painful as some later levels seem to stretch on forever and if gamers die they'll have to restart the scenarios from the beginning, a frustration to be sure.    Control is tight, for the most part. The on-foot missions with the dual-blade wielding hero Bors are particularly enjoyable as the character is quick and menacing. Some of the horseback-driven levels by comparison feel slow and clunky. The horses are sluggish to turn around and the animation for the animals is too stiff for our liking. The bow and arrow elements enable characters to target and shoot far off enemies and the lock-on system works well, but the process is slow, leaving gamers open to attack.   Krome has designed a series of in-game scripted events that successfully keep the action moving along believably. The enemies topple trees that come crashing to the ground, blocking pathways, and foes rush and surround the title's heroes from both ends. These scenes work very well and help break from the monotony of fighting enemy after enemy.  The characters are well modeled and detailed, although their low-polygon make-up is apparent up close. The environments, meanwhile, are downright pretty at points and bland other times. The strong list of locales ranges from forests and bridges to small towns and snowy landscapes. The game easily draws tens of enemy characters on-screen with no hitch in fluidity and there are even background extras like animated leaves that blow around the world and shimmering, realistic water. There are two technical downsides, however. The first is that players are clearly limited to very linear, set paths. Although lush forests can be seen to each side of a path, invisible walls prevent gamers from actually exploring the region. Meanwhile, there are occasional collision detection problems; gamers will not always get a rewarding sense of ~umph~ when their sword connects with a foe, and they'll also every so often clip directly through an object. The good news is that the voice acting is top notch and the music, fully orchestrated, sounds crisp and clear.King Arthur is one of those games that are fun in short bursts, but the more you play them, the more you find yourself growing sleepy because of the formula. Developer Krome Studios has done a respectable job of bringing what was an unremarkable movie license to the videogame arena. The game is certainly more compelling than the movie. The fight mechanics are for the most part well developed and intuitive, and both the five different, playable characters and RPG-like upgrade system are likely to draw some gamers in for awhile. And on top of everything else, there's a cooperative mode, too. But in the end, not even these extras can mask the fact that everything said and done, the repetitive nature of this hack-and-slash title will eventually get the best of those who pursue it, and if it doesn't the unfair difficulty of some later levels probably will.Worth a rental.", "date": "Nov 20, 2004"}
