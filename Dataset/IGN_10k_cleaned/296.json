Frogger, the classic arcade game released nearly two decades ago, has been shipped on the system, and despite the hardware limitations of the system the game is pretty darn accurate to the original and just as fun. Features: Classic and Enhanced modes Level select Up to four players (alternating) For Game.Com  The Game.Com rendition of Frogger is a near-spot on recreation of the classic arcade game: get good ol' froggy from the bottom of the screen one of five locations at the top of the screen by either avoiding traffic on the highway, maneuvering over logs and turtles in a flowing river, or both. There are hazards that get in your way  avoid the poisonous snake, deadly alligator...and obviously you don't want to fall into the river or get nailed by a big rig.  Unique to the Game.Com version of Frogger is a new ~updated~ version of the game. Right out of the box, the game is in ~classic~ mode, and the images look really close to the original sprites used in the arcade game. The ~updated~ version is essentially the same game with newer, 3D versions of the vehicle, log, and turtle sprites. Further in the game the levels will switch from the standard half traffic/half river layouts to all river, or all traffic levels. This addition is really cool, since the developers didn't really muck around with the original gameplay... they just made newer levels using the existing elements.  One of the downsides to the Game.Com system is its downright horrid LCD screen that smears and ghosts when the action gets too fast to refresh accurately. Frogger suffers a little bit here  especially in the higher levels with faster traffic  but because only a few items on the screen are moving, it's easy to keep track of all the obstacles in the game.   I do have a few complaints. First, the game ends. That's right, instead of getting increasingly more difficult until it becomes impossible to play, the game gives you a Game Over screen at the end of level 13. Second, the game isn't totally like the arcade  to fit everything on-screen, the five lanes of traffic and five lanes of river obstacles have been reduced to 3 each. And third, I've worn out three sets of AA batteries reviewing this game because it doesn't let you turn off the power within the game. The power button is software disabled in Frogger, and I've mindlessly left it on after hitting the power button, thinking that turned off the system. Oops. This is a very good rendition of Frogger  the graphics, despite being grayscale, are a very accurate representation of the original arcade game. Even the music and sound effects are darn near close to the classic. It's one of the best Game.Com games I've played  but it's not a very complex game to do on the system.", "date": "Oct 7, 1999"}
