One of the greatest genres of the 16-bit era was the action-RPG. The category combined the leveling-up style of traditional role-playing character progression with faster, real-time combat and it was generally well-accepted. Big hits on the SNES included Secret of Mana, Secret of Evermore and Illusion of Gaia. On the Genesis, there was Beyond Oasis.   It first hit SEGA's system back in 1994 -- and if you're from a country other than the United States, you may remember it as The Story of Thor -- but in this edition, it's the story of Prince Ali. Ali is restless royalty. Unhappy with just spending his days lazing about the palace, the young Prince entertains himself with his hobby of treasure hunting. And his latest find is major: an ancient Golden Armlet, an artifact left behind from a legendary war between wizards. Ali's quest to recover the armlet from its hidden resting place sets into motion a major change of events, and it's up to him to restore the power to the golden gauntlet by finding and reawakening four sleeping, summon spirits and, along the way, save the kingdom of Oasis from disaster.           Beyond Oasis' plot is set up wonderfully by a set of colorful opening cutscenes, and the vibrancy continues into the gameplay. Ali runs and jumps and attacks with fluid animations, and all of it is immediately enjoyable. The environments, too, are done well, though the fantasy setting is a bit of a mixed bag -- lacking a true hook that sets Oasis distinctly apart from any other 16-bit realm of adventure.   Control isn't perfectly tight. Ali's flowing animations are numerous, yes, but triggering each takes a bit of getting used to. Simple strikes with his dagger, for example, all hinge on proper timing. Lightly tapping the button will activate a quick, forward jab, while holding it for a second before releasing will unleash instead a more powerful arcing strike. Beyond Oasis does a lot with a little in this way. The system was made to work on the Genesis' three-button controller, so using different timing cues allowed each of those three buttons to serve double duty.   The A Button is initially unusable. It's reserved for a technique you pick up partway into the adventure -- spirit summoning. Once they're found and awakened, Ali can call forth each of the four elemental spirits by projecting a ball of light into a representation of their unique element. For example, the water spirit Dytto can only be summoned when there's a body of water around -- a lake, a waterfall, something like that. Puzzles in the game take advantage of this unique mechanic: there may be a wall of fire blocking your path that you need Dytto to douse, but first you'll have to trigger a switch, to activate a geyser, to provide a source of natural water that Dytto can be summoned out of. Very stylish.It's its stylishness that makes Beyond Oasis a hit. It's not a timeless classic, and it could have used a bit more polish in several areas, but it is a solid representation of 16-bit era action-RPGs. Does Beyond Oasis deserve to be mentioned alongside such classics as Secret of Mana? Sure! Check it out, genre fans, you'll be surprised.", "date": "Mar 22, 2007"}
