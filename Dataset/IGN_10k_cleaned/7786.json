It was 1989, and the 16-bit era's beginnings were being largely ignored by a nation full of gamers still addicted to the NES. The first few that followed Hudson and NEC into the next generation got to experience some titles that would ultimately go down as classics, like the prehistoric platformer Bonk's Adventure. But then there were also those games that were destined for a lesser legacy, like the arcade racer Victory Run.   The NES was home to Rad Racer, and Sega had brought the world OutRun. Victory Run was the Turbo's try at the same game formula  the arcade action rally racer. Each game put players in control of a car, seen from a third-person, behind-the-vehicle perspective, and tasked them to drive through twisting tracks full of traffic to reach checkpoints and the checkered flag. What Victory Run did new was add a bit of sim to the mix.           The entire game is one big rally race, starting in France and crossing the finish line in Senegal. Before setting out from Paris, though, you get the chance to pick an array of upgrades and repair kits to use later on, in-between rounds of the race. The items come in five varieties  tires, transmission, engine parts, suspension kits and brakes. The way you race determines what kind of parts you'll need, and how many of each. For example, shifting gears is part of the gameplay control. If you do a good job at shifting when you should, your car will perform admirably. But poor work of the clutch and stick can lead to a blown transmission, crippling your vehicle and necessitating a trip to the shop. You're in luck if you chose the proper repair parts back in gay Pari, but in trouble if all you brought along was a stack of spare radials.   Victory Run's visuals are a bit of mixed bag, looking back. On one hand, the age of the game is obvious. Its overall look is on par with racers appearing on the NES around the same time, Rad Racer in particular. On the other hand, it pushes beyond the 8-bit competition with a much more vibrant color palette and some impressive effects  the time will change from day to night and back again as you race, and the environment around your car will follow suit by growing darker or lighter as needed.   The control, though, is firmly fixed in the '80s, with very little innovation made beyond the addition of a D-Pad activated gear shift. Later 16-bit games would revolutionize the racing genre with new handling styles and an increased sense of connection to the road  Victory Run played it safe.  Playing it safe in your game design can lead to a fun title, but will never result in a classic. Victory Run is a fair rally racer that is still fun to play, but just isn't all that remarkable in any aspect. Fans of the genre can play it safe themselves and resist downloading this one, as other, more classic racing titles will be available on the service in the year to come. Those wanting an immediate 16-bit solution to their need for speed would do well to look toward Nintendo's SNES effort, F-Zero.", "date": "Dec 8, 2006"}
