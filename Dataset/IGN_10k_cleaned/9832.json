Capcom may be the company with the most consistent 2D fighting hit track record, but it's SNK's fighting titles that prevented the ill-fated NeoGeo home console from becoming a crippling disaster and endeared it to die-hard fighting fans from LA to Tokyo. It's no surprise then that SNK is backing its color handheld with all its major hand-to-hand and weapons combat franchises, luring fighting fans away from the Game Boy Color -- a handheld that has yet to see its first decent brawler.  Features  14+ characters. Five play modes. Two control modes. Three difficulty settings. Customizable battle settings. Play head-to-head via the link cable. Compatible with NeoGeo Pocket and NeoGeo Pocket Color. Supports data swapping with Sega Dreamcast.   The Game If you like deep, competitive fighting games, then King of Fighters R-2 is just what you've been waiting for. Released as part of SNK's ~Pocket Fighting Series~, R-2 faithfully recreates the martial arts combat of its arcade predecessors on the pocket-size handheld. Amazingly, the game not only controls and plays well, but also comes packed with a wealth of features often absent even from 32- or 64-bit fighting games.  R2 offers players to pick from 14 different classic SNK fighters (plus a few hidden ones), ranging from Kyo Kusanagi to the ever-popular Mai Shiranui. While the number of moves for each character is more limited than in the arcade KoF games (necessitated by the fact that the NeoGeo Pocket only has two action buttons), it's still nothing to sneer at. Next to a variety of punches and kicks pulled off by pushing the stick into a direction while hitting either A or B, there are more than 10 special moves for EACH fighter, ranging from simple ~Hadokens~ like Athena's Psychoball Attack to complex moves like Shermie's Carnival.  There are two ways to play: Extra Mode and the more complex Advanced Mode. Depending on which mode you select, the game features a slightly different power gauge system. In Extra Mode, players can manually fill up their power meter. When it's full, it enables super power moves, body tosses and emergency escape maneuvers. In the Advanced Mode, the gauge increases with each successful blow, then players manually activate the MAX Power Mode to pull off super special moves.  After picking your fighting mode of choice, you select from five gameplay modes:  Single Battle -- pick one character and go one-on-one with the rest of the SNK crew. Team Battle -- three-on-three. Making Mode -- create a custom fighter and battle for skills. Up to 20 accumulated skills can be ~equipped~ to boost the fighter's performance. Sparring -- train moves against a fighter of your choice. Versus Mode -- link your NeoGeo Pocket with a second unit to play against a friend. Select from Single Vs, Team Vs, Making Vs or Skill Trade. DC Mode -- link to a Dreamcast and swap data with the DC version of King of Fighters.   The game itself plays beautifully, no matter what mode you select. The NeoGeo control stick really shows its strength in King of Fighters as players concentrate on fighting their opponents -- not fighting with a cross-shaped D-Pad. Even if you don't have a second player to compete with, replay value is high thanks to the many modes, secret moves and hidden characters. There are also three different difficulty settings, customizable battle configurations and the game even tracks single-player and vs. Win/lose records.  Graphics are sharp and smooth, with plenty of anime-style artwork and inanimate, but nicely designed backdrops. Of course, the real stars of the game are the characters, which are depicted in the Japanese ~super-deformed~ style. All the characters are exceptionally well-animated. And since this is a Japanese fighting game, expect the usual skimpy fighting outfits for the girls, with the occasional gratuitous underwear shot and jiggling boobs, despite their SD nature...   Sadly, the programmers ran out of space and couldn't fit any speech on this cart -- but that's really a small sacrifice considering the amount of characters and stage backdrops. On the up-side, the sound effects are good and there are so many different melodies to accompany the fights that it won't get old too quickly. I have to admit that I've never been a fan of SNK's character design, but there is absolutely no question that this game rocks. Controls are responsive, the graphics are colorful and there are enough features and characters to keep you playing for a long time. Link up with a friend and you will never stop. Fans of fighting games -- get yourself a NeoGeo Pocket Color! This is the best handheld fighter yet.", "date": "Jul 20, 1999"}
