{"name": "Pac-Man Pinball Mobile", "name_review": "Pac-Man Pinball", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/11/pac-man-pinball", "text": "The idea of a pinball game that uses Pac-Man as the ball is an excellent one. Too bad Pac-Man Pinball isn't that game. Instead, Namco has superimposed some Pac-Man trimmings on a basic two-screen pinball table set and left it at that. The result is a game where you might have been left wanting more, should what was there have actually been enjoyable in the first place.   Video pinball games live or die by their physics models, and Pac-Man Pinball really falls on its own sword on this count. The game reacts poorly to your inputs. Lining up a shot with a flipper is more crap shoot than skill contest, making blown shots seem entirely unfair and not your fault. When you try to flip the ball into the top-half of the screen, it seems to lazily make its way up there, almost as hesitant as you should be to download the game. Bouncing off bumpers seems to have no rhyme or reason, too.   These problems render Pac-Man Pinball nearly unplayable, and that's a real shame. The game itself doesn't look bad, at all. The table is bright and colorful, and you expect it to go full tilt with lights and buzzers. It never really does, but at least it looks ready to trip the light fantastic. The Pac theme is complete with art from the old-school games, as well as the presence of things like fruit and ghosts. The audio is a little lacking.  Don't download Pac-Man Pinball. It's just not a good game. If you want some Pac on your cell, may I recommend the classic Ms. Pac-Man or InfoSpace's Ms. Pac-Man for Prizes? Or even Pac-Mania, which was just launched. Anything but this. Pac -- and his fans -- deserve better.", "date": "Jun 11, 2005"}
