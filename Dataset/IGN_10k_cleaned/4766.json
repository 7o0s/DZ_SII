This was the start of Activision, a game publisher who went on to release some of the best videogames of the industry's golden years. Who can forget classics such as Pitfall, River Raid, and Kaboom?  Years later, Activision is, incredibly, still alive and kicking. And with the popularity of the Retrogaming craze (and the slew of emulators on the scene), the company put together a pack of the games that made the company what it is. Activision Classics is a 30 pack of emulated Atari 2600 games that the company released in the early '80s:   Atlantis (originally an Imagic-released game), Barnstorming, Boxing, Chopper Command, Crackpot, Cosmic Commuter, Dolphin, Dragster,Enduro, Fishing Derby, Freeway, Frostbite, Grad Prix, Hero, Ice Hockey, Kaboom!, Keystone Capers, Laser Blast, Megamania, Pitfall, Plaque Attack, River Raid, River Raid 2, Seaquest, Skiing, Sky Jinx, Spider Fighter, Stampede, Starmaster, and Tennis.  Don't expect anything other than direct versions of the classic games. After all, these are classics. Oh...my...god. This pack is really, really bad. Look, I'm all for the classic games, in fact, I still have my Atari collection in my apartment. In fact, Activision Atari 2600 games were always the best of the breed. But this pack does nothing but speak poorly about the games of my childhood.The problem here is, the emulator is terrible. Most games run at an abysmally choppy framerate, which is absolutely unacceptable for fast-paced games like Grand Prix, Spider Fighter, and H.E.R.O. Pitfall runs too slow, and River Raid has lousy collision detection when shooting the rear of helicopters. And why the heck didn't the developers include analog support for Kaboom!, a game that was made for Breakout-style paddle controls?What's worse is there's really no presentation of the game's history  it's just the games. Back in the game's early days, Activision always put the game designer/programmer in the spotlight, complete with amusing anecdotes about the game's design. Where'd they go? And remember when the company rewarded game experts with patches for beating a certain score? No mention of those, either.Not all Activision games are represented. What about my favorites, like Robot Tank, Pressure Cooker, Beam Rider, and the incredible Pitfall II? Not here, I'm afraid.Granted, some games made the conversion better than others, like Enduro, Dragster and Laser Blast, and the front interface where you plug cartridges into a virtual Atari 2600 is a pretty cool presentation. But cripes, go down to your local flea market and get the real games instead of this compilation  for five bucks you can pick up a system AND the games. Plus you've got yourself a bit of vintage gaming history.", "date": "Sep 30, 1998"}
