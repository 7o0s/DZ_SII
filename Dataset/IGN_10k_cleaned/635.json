{"name": "Catz", "name_review": "Catz", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/15/catz-2", "text": "is the sequel to Dogz, which began its life as a Windows 95 desktop toy about five years ago, where you ~adopted~ a dog and let it scamper across your workscreen. By paying attention to it (i.e. affection, negative reinforcement), you dictated how well the dog will grow up. It wasn't really a game as much as something to do while you worked on an article in your word processor. You can now play with a crib of Catz on the Game Boy Color -- but the idea just doesn't translate well as a portable game.   Features Multiple breeds of Catz, including hidden ones More than a dozen play items Special bonus toys Link cable support for trading Catz and toys Only for Game Boy Color Catz is essentially a more elaborate Tamagotchi virtual pet (and yes, we're aware that the idea of these Petz was originally released before the virtual pet craze). Simply pick one of three Catz from a list, adopt it, name it, and its yours. Your task is to keep it happy by feeding it, playing with it, showing it affection, and punishing it when it's bad. Your cat remains in one screen, but you can change the background to add a little variety. If you treat your cat well by feeding it when its hungry and playing with it when it's awake (catnip, scratching post), it'll last a long time. Treat it badly, and it'll run away.  As fun as it was to play with your pet on the PC, you only did it for minutes at a time -- the multitasking nature of the PC let you have a little fun with your pet while you worked on something else. On the Game Boy Color, the only thing you can do is play with your pet -- that's it. The developer knew this design drawback, so the company built in some motivators to keep you playing. The more you play the game and the more successful a trainer you are, the more hidden toys and breeds of Catz you can earn. And if you have a friend with a copy of the game, you can trade the toys and breeds of Catz to him through the infra-red link. But all the game is, is a more elaborate Tamagotchi that sucks batteries and prevents you from playing anything else on your Game Boy Color.  The game is a port of the PC game, but the graphics had to be scaled back because of the PC design. Instead of the smoothly-animated, vector-ball build of the Catz, Saffire had to take key frames of animations. Because of this, the animals in the Game Boy Color version lack the personality from the PC edition, since the Petz don't really have a unique life of their own. They can only run through established frames of animations (running, sleeping, eating). These Petz don't physically grow like they do in the PC version of the game. The creatures in Catz have a little more personality than those in Dogz, but not much. There's really nothing here to keep you interested -- Catz is a decent virtual pet simulator, but virtual pets are only things to use for minutes at a time, and not something you'll want to keep permanently in your Game Boy Color system.  I don't really see too many people playing with their Catz for hours on end. Pet it, feed it, and turn it off.", "date": "Jan 15, 2000"}
