{"name": "NBA Street", "name_review": "NBA Street", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/19/nba-street-3", "text": "To say that the EA Sports Big brand is off to a tremendous start would be a bit of an understatement. With its first release, SSX, we were given what was undoubtedly the PlayStation 2's best launch game and a title with play mechanics and elements of design that will be copied and has been copied by numerous other developers making videogame software. And now with the release of NBA Street, the guys over at EA Canada have somehow managed to even surpass their first baby as they've created what's quite possibly the best arcade sports game that's ever been made.   Gameplay To try and improve on the arcade basketball genre that seemed pretty maxed out with NBA Showtime, Midway went ahead and upped the ante by adding a third player per team with the release of its NBA Hoopz game. But instead of revolutionizing the genre, all this made most players think is that they were getting the exact same game with just another player.   People fearing the same thing with NBA Street need not worry, though, as the developers at EA Canada and NuFX have added some features that might just revolutionize the seemingly exhausted genre. The two most significant of these new features is an SSX-like trick system and the re-invention of the blocked shot.   For those that have played the very first game released under the EA Sports Big label, SSX, the new trick system will give you a bit of deja vu. By pressing the trick button in conjunction with any one or combination of the shoulder buttons, the controlled player will perform specific moves in conjunction with the button presses. And much like SSX, this isn't something that's just for show as it's integrated perfectly with the gameplay.   Players are rewarded for performing tricks, combinations or special moves by having their Gamebreaker meter fill up, which when filled gives them an opportunity to hit a shot that could single-handedly change the outlook of the game. With a standard 1-point shot, the player not only gets the point added to his total, but it's also subtracted from his opponent's score. And if you hit a 2-pointer, the outcome is a swing of a total of four points as the player gets two, while the opponent loses the same.   As a result, players are forced to try and find a balance between trying to do as many tricks as possible while still remaining competitive on the court. If you just concentrate on tricks alone, you could find yourself having to force bad shots as time is expiring on the clock, giving your opposition an advantage. Likewise, if you only concentrate on putting the ball in the hoop and nothing else, you might find yourself at a point where you lose a lead because your foe hits a 2-point Gamebreaker that turns your three-point lead into a deficit.   The other, and possibly most significant, aspect of NBA Street that helps it revolutionize the genre is the way that it has essentially re-invented the blocked shot. In most basketball games, especially arcade-styled ones, the most exciting phase of it is the slam-dunk and the game is almost always much more enjoyable when you have the ball in your hands and not when on the defensive. Well, in Street, blocked shots are a huge part of whether or not you dominate the courts and coming up with a huge rejection where you grab the opponent's shot out of the air with two hands or throw it hard against the backboard is every bit as enjoyable and rewarding as getting a 360-degree slam-dunk.   That's not to say that dunks no longer have any impact as that's just so far from the truth that it's not even funny. The dunks you get in Street pack a lot of punch and players will be able to do everything from two-handed reverse slams to big dunks to where they pass it to themselves off of the backboard. Furthermore, the game features a very simple ally-oop system where teammates will cut to the hoop for the ~oop~ whenever they have an open lane and all the player must do is time the pass to the player for the powerful dunk to happen. Getting a first-rate ally-oop is not only rewarding on the visceral level but when done in conjunction with special moves can boost up that Gamebreaker meter more than everything else, so it's very important to take advantage of this.   The only downside to this is that the balance of the game isn't quite the same, as you'd get with the same players in real life. Someone like a Shawn Bradley is so much more dominant in this game than he has ever been on an NBA court and team without a big shot blocker will generally be at a disadvantage against one with a big man, even if it wouldn't be the case in our world. Having a team with players with great shot blockers and dunkers are much more important than having quick players that are good at stealing the ball or ones that are deadly from the outside.   That's not to say that you can't win the game with a team filled with shorter players or ones that can't block shots, as that's not really the case either -- it's just a littler harder. Since, ~threes~ give you two points now and regular ~twos~ only give you one, the three-point shot is twice as rewarding as regular shot instead of the regular 3/2 advantage. Because of this, the extra risk and increased difficulty of hitting from the outside is still balanced by the extra rewards.   Regardless, the game is a tremendous amount of fun to play and this is the case in both single player and two-player modes. As with most sports games of this style, the multiplayer mode is definitely its most enjoyable facet. Ever since this game first appeared in the office, it has been the most played and requested multiplayer game on the system and regardless of the skill of the players, it always provides a highly enjoyable experience of both participants.   One of things that really makes it a blast to play is the fact that it's played to 21 points and you must win by two. We've had numerous games where we end up playing to 30 or more points, while trading leads and ~game point~ situations multiple times before one person finally gets the two point victory. What makes this so exciting is that what this really gives you is the potential for numerous ~last-second-buzzer-beater-for-the-win~ situations instead of just the one you'd get when playing with a clock.   My only complaint with the game's multiplayer mode is that it's limited to two-player contests as the game doesn't support the multi-tap for four or even six player support. They might have had to move the camera back some for it to work, but four-player support would've helped increase this game's value almost 10-fold if it was pulled off effectively. Even without four-player support, though, this is one of the best multiplayer games around and could easily be played with a large group of people in a tournament type of ~winner keeps the court~ fashion.   Despite the fact that this game is best when played with another person, those of you without friends to play with shouldn't immediately pass this one up. The game has a pretty intricate one-player system that rewards players continuously, as secrets are constantly opened up and extra goodies can be won after just about every single contest.   The create-a-player function is one of the best you'll find in any sports game and created players can be edited and changed at any time. All this is made even better by the fact that it's tied together to the gameplay because players are given the chance to upgrade their created player after each victory if they choose not to select one of the players from the team they've just conquered. What's more, the number of attribute points that can be one is directly correlated with the number of trick points that the player earned while beating their adversary.   Beyond the City Circuit mode and all that can be earned while playing through it, there's a Hold The Court Mode that enables you earn even more stuff, including new looks, shoes and clothing for your created player, if you accomplish certain tasks such as scoring enough trick points or getting a big win streak on each of the different unlocked courts.   The single player mode also offers up a really challenging contest when played on the medium or hard difficulty settings depending on the team you're using. While it's easy to run the table on the ~easy~ setting, this isn't the case when you bump up the level of challenge. When playing against strong computer-controlled opponents on the harder levels, the computer will play much more intelligently and will actually try and boost up their Gamebreaker meter every bit as hard as you do. The games are extremely competitive and almost all of them come down to the very end with things like who can come up with the most Gamebreakers being the one who comes out victorious.   Graphics Given that there are four fewer players on the court, it's no surprise that the visuals in NBA Street are a marked improvement over what we saw in NBA Live 2001. The player models still have a plastic-like look to them and the player animation can be a bit stiff and quirky at times, but what we have here is still better than any other basketball game on the system.   The courts are intricately detailed and offer up some lively environments. Lots of spectators appear on the sidelines and are constantly animated and moving around, some courts have other moving objects in the backgrounds like cars, and you'll encounter environmental effects like wet or snowy courts.   And despite the animation being a bit stiff and unrealistic at times, there are plenty of outlandish, street-oriented, motion-captured moves that will impress even the most cynical of gamers and the rim and net animation is in a huge leap beyond anything previously seen in a videogame.   The game speed is pretty fast, the framerate rarely dips during gameplay and there aren't really any big visual flaws. NBA Street might not be a showcase of the graphical potential of the PlayStation 2, but it also doesn't bring forth any of its weaknesses.   Sound Perfectly befitting of the game's general theme, NBA Street offers gamers a remarkably good hip-hop soundtrack that helps set the general tone of the game. This is backed up by character voices that while a bit stereotypical, are never offensive and help really make you believe that you're playing ball on the city streets.   Joe ~The Show~ Jackson offers up some outrageous pre-, post- and in-game commentary that'll rip into you when you're playing like a chum and praise you as the next coming when you're on the top of your game. The commentary and excellent background music is accompanied by a lot of mood-setting ambient sound effects.   You'll hear murmurs from the crowd, lots of different background chatter and even the occasional yell from the stands. The only thing that'll keep you from believing that you're not actually out there on the court is the fact that the game makes use of some outlandish sound effects that you'll never hear in the real world. This is far from a bad thing as the different sound effects do nothing but enhance the game experience, by making the impact of things like dunks and blocked shots extremely powerful.Even though I found NFL Blitz to be highly entertaining when it was first released and have probably plopped down more quarters into the original NBA Jam and NBA Jam T.E. than any other arcade game in existence, I've always preferred the sports simulations to their arcade counterparts. As fun as Blitz was, it didn't have the depth or play value that you got in Madden and the cases were similar in other sports including hockey, baseball and even basketball. Well, with the release of NBA Street, EA Sports has managed to make an arcade hoops game that I'll take over any basketball simulation any day of the week. Sure, it might not be a realistic representation of the sport (most of the simulations don't even do that), but through its over-the-top and highly unrealistic style, Street manages to capture a lot of the essence of the sport that's often missed in the simulations. Through its brilliant use of an SSX-styled trick system and the way that the developers have managed to make blocked shots as important and every bit as exciting as slam dunks, NBA Street has taken the arcade basketball genre to all-new heights. If you're a fan of sports, basketball or arcade styled games in general, this is a must-have title that's easily one of the best games that the PlayStation 2 has to offer. Go buy it now, I promise you, you won't regret.", "date": "Jun 19, 2001"}
