We have a surfeit of games dealing with the American Civil War and an equal surplus of games showcasing the battles of Napoleon and his contemporaries. The fact that those conflicts are ideal for a particular and enjoyable kind of gaming makes the absence of other settings understandable but no less unfortunate. There have been a few recent attempts to provide alternatives -- some good, some bad.   GSC Gameworld's Cossacks got the period right but missed the theater altogether. Their Russian cavalry game was an ideal forerunner for their newest game, American Conquest. The new game focuses on the colonial wars in America, from the landing of Christopher Columbus to the British defeat at Yorktown. Featuring 12 playable nations selected from the European powers, American colonists and natives, American Conquest is as comprehensive as it is detailed.   While the game plays out according to a familiar RTS pattern, it brings a few unique traits to the table. Sure, there's the requisite base building and resource collection. And yes, you can make units and go burn the other guy's town down. But as you fight for the New World, you'll find yourself in charge of literally thousands of units at a time and they'll be fighting across maps designed to hold such numbers. Further, the game lets you zoom out to get a much more strategic view of the action, a view that makes organizing your formations much easier.   You can take the lead in the expeditions led by Columbus or Pizarro. Or you can fight in the Seven Year's War from either the British or French sides. The same is possible of the British and American sides in the Revolutionary War. Tecumseh's Rebellion offers the only chance to play as the natives in a campaign. While they play a pivotal role in all campaigns, the real focus is on the conflict between the European and colonial armies.   GSC is to be commended for breaking out of the ~kill everything~ mentality of mission design. Rather than forcing the player to exterminate every other unit on the map, American Conquest features a lot of missions with very narrow and specific objectives. In some you'll merely have to reach a certain population limit. In others you'll have to capture a key enemy structure. Resource collection, priest protection and good old fashioned exploration are also on the agenda as mission objectives.   Within the missions, there are various undefined objectives of a much smaller nature. Things like capturing enemy storehouses helps your own economy while damaging that of your enemy. Capturing these structures (or indeed any other) requires you to storm the building with your forces. They rush in, fight it out and hopefully gain control of the structure. While this can be merely convenient in the case of most buildings, seizing control of any enemy fort can spell total victory for your side.   Fittingly, the game features a large number of defense-oriented missions where you have to hold off an enemy attack for a specified amount of time. Forts and friendly structures can be immeasurably useful in these situations. You can garrison friendly units in buildings, giving them the chance to shoot at passing enemies from behind protection. For some stupid reason the game prevents a fort currently involved in unit production to fire on the enemies.   A few of the missions won't allow you to produce extra units. In some of those cases, what you have is all you'll get. In others, you can trigger reinforcements from time to time. My favorite of these is a gold raiding mission in the Pizarro campaign. As you sack village after village, you're sending money off to purchase reinforcements.   Outside of that, there are plenty of missions that let you build and create an army as you fight. Continuing a recent trend in the RTS market, American Conquest only lets you ~create~ one type of unit -- the peasant. You'll need to train these peasants in special structures in order to turn them in to the various types of units found in the game. It's a good concept and one that allows you to build up a sizeable army very quickly but, I have to say, it makes more sense for the American colonists and natives than it does for the British.   The AI is fairly strong. While the need to use native troops in battle introduces a bit of an unbalanced situation by design, the game is equally good at using both European and native armies. It knows how and when to spread out and how and when to concentrate, at least on the harder levels. An aggressive player won't have any trouble circling around behind the lower level opponents. Strategically, it can be a shrewd competitor, particularly on the maps where you have to keep from starving to death.    But there are a few small holes in the AI. I find it hard to believe that a group of 8 trappers can't kill a bear without a lot of micromanaging and speedy clicking. I should be able to send them out without fearing that they'll become the dinner of the first nasty thing they see, right? In any case, it's certainly not the point of the game and should be a bit better automated. Pathfinding is also a bit touchy and not just because of the terrain. Units are confused by close trees, for instance, but can walk through the densest friendly formation around.   The game models a wide variety of factors. First up is morale, which Napoleon said was three times more significant than any physical aspect of battle. Here you'll see the tide turn based on the resolve of the troops. You can check in with the unit info screen to see exactly what's causing the morale to break. The game also prompts you with short on-screen messages to indicate some of the bigger problems. But the key success of the morale model is that it works naturally so that things like inexperience, flank attacks, defeat of friendly forces or the death of officers all conspire to reduce morale. Sticking together in big groups is a big help.   The game also models things like shot power and decreased accuracy over distance. You'll even find that garrisoned buildings are more dangerous on the sides that have more windows. It's this kind of intuitive thinking that makes the details fun rather than merely interesting. But while your units can fire in to forts killing the defenders inside, your units can't fire through buildings to hit units on the other side. When it's a fort, it makes sense; when it's a teepee, it seems arbitrarily silly. (It's equally dumb that I can't select a unit behind a building without drawing a box around it.)   Formations are among the most obvious and fundamental components of tactics, particularly for the period represented in the game. I suppose even Napoleon knew that. Assuming none of the other factors are strongly allied against you, managing the shape, position and facing of your armies is the key to victory in this game. Thankfully, the game offers a simple hotkey for the formation you'd like. A more flexible, scalable set of formation commands (like that found in Creative Assembly's Total War series) would make things even more versatile.   Sadly, while some of the game's formation requirements make sense historically, they tend to distract from the real fun to be had. It's simple that armies need an officer (or chief/shaman) unit to assume different formations. But that some of them need drummers or standard bearers still seems a bit arbitrary to me. Ordering the units to assume line, column, square or wedge formation has a substantial impact on their combat effectiveness.   But it seems too easy for units to pass through friendly formations. While it can make things more convenient -- if you're halberdiers advance through your musketmen they can stave off a cavalry charge, for instance -- it means you really don't ever have to move around your own men. This ties in with another problem I have with the intense crowding that occurs in some situations. Historically accurate or not, the game simply isn't up to the challenge of rendering a tightly packed mass of troops as anything other than an indistinct mosaic of colors.   The formations not only help drive home the geometric nature of battle during the period -- squares and lines wheeling and colliding, solid rectangles breaking in to fragments under an enemy attack; They also add to the spectacle of the game as well. Seeing a brightly uniformed army marching in strict formation, you can't help but be transported. War's a terrible business, to be sure, but the pageantry of the Enlightenment battlefield is impossible to deny -- at least until a cannonball rips your testicles off -- and American Conquest gets it just right.   It also manages to provide a strong sense of detail in the settings. Though largely static, the environments in the game are beautiful. Trees and streams look realistic and the buildings are loaded with detail. As your musketmen fire, little puffs of smoke appear in front of them. The shot and reloading animations help keep the rhythm of the battle right in front of you and the bayonet charge is almost as cool as the neat little death animations.    And while I appreciate the game's true line-of-sight modeling, I would've preferred that areas that have already been explored not fall back in to blackness just because my troops have left the area. American Conquest comes with a constant and recycling shroud that only shows you what your units can see. I'd much rather see a greyed out fog of war in the areas I've already explored. At the very least, it's useful to keep the geography in mind.  I think it's important that developers are making games that focus on the scale of battle. A dozen orcs fighting a dozen knights is fun, but give me a fight involving 200 fusiliers any day. American Conquest succeeds in bringing the numbers to the forefront. With loads of units on the screen, it really delivers on the spectacle of battle. The effectiveness of formations and the subtleties of morale make this more than just a good RTS with historical dressing. It's a legitimate attempt to capture the period it tries to represent.That this game is developed by a Ukranian team surprises me. Obviously they knew what they were doing with Cossacks and I'm glad to see their expertise translated to a new series of battlegrounds. Though they're far removed in time and space, they've managed to show us what's entertaining about the battles for Empire waged in the Americas.", "date": "Feb 10, 2003"}
