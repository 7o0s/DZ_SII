It's actually amazing that someone is willing to make a Shrek game after the catastrophe that was Shrek Extra Large (specifically the GameCube port). However, Activision, with the help of the True Crime: Streets of L.A. team (Luxoflux), has decided to take on this rather large and green challenge. Has Shrek regained his video game honor? Read on. Features:10 playable characters  Visit locals from the movie and beyond, including ~Walking the Path~ and ~Far, Far Away Land~ Switch between four different characters at any given time Hero Time allows a party member to embark on a solo adventure Up to three additional players can seamlessly join or exit the game at any point Runs in progressive scan Supports Dolby Pro Logic II  GameplayShrek 2's storyline basically follows the same plot of the movie. As with the blockbuster movie's sequel, Shrek and Fiona are on a journey to Far, Far Away Land to visit Fiona's parents. Shrek's in-laws aren't too thrilled that a crude ogre is married to their beloved daughter -- so the battle for acceptance ensues. However, while Shrek 2 also incorporates bits of the movie's plot into its own, it also covers things not shown in the feature film. Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface (text and illustrations) shown before each level. It's mainly there to justify why you're doing a certain thing, instead of creating an immersive story. The lack of a story elements aren't really missed -- and several humorous in game cut scenes, tasks, and one-liners help balance out the gameplay.  Gameplay is the meat of Shrek 2. It might not be incredibly deep, but it is a surprisingly fun jaunt through DreamWorks' fairy tale world. The game is broken into different chapters, each with their own set of goals. One might require you to make sure three blind mice safely make their way to the witch's house, another might have you act as a deputy in Far, Far Away Land -- collecting bits of Humpty Dumpty, stealing treasure from a troll, escorting Cinderella while she window shops for a glass slipper, or ridding the town to the Pied Piper's rat infestation -- collecting chickens for a stew, or battling Puss in Boots via timed button presses. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubemedia.ign.com%2Fcube%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F511%2F511854%2Fshrek-2-200405050740375.jpg&caption=When your objective isn't strictly mini-quest based -- like your venture from Fairy Godmother's House to the Farm -- you'll be required to smash your way through numerous enemies and negotiate all sorts of environmental hazards. It seems like standard stuff, but it's spiced up by the need to swap between characters (three accompany Shrek on each mission). Each character has a special ability -- although some are strictly combat related, most are required for puzzle solving. Shrek uses his strength to lift heavy gears to open doors or move large boxes. Fiona has a Matrix-style bullet time to get past fast moving enemies, avoid crocodiles, or aid in combat. Puss in Boots is the only character that can walk on wires and you'll need Donkey's Burro Blast to knock down fences. Lil' Red and the Gingerbread Man both have projectile attacks that are needed to hit far away targets. Most won't have any problem figuring out when to use each character (especially since the Magic Mirror will give you hints if you're stuck), but it does add the much needed puzzle dynamic to gameplay.  Of course, there's another reason for the four characters dynamic -- multiplayer. Shrek 2 allows up to three of your friends to join (or leave) your game at any time. All they have to do is plug in the controller. And, Shrek 2 works wonderfully as a multiplayer title because it blends Gauntlet with a party game elements. When you don't have an extra set of hands lying about, the computer will control all unmanned characters. This usually doesn't pose too many problems because the characters will automatically attack nearby enemies. Also, if a computer controlled character dies, it'll respawn as soon as you clear the area of opposition. What doesn't work well is that unless you're in a combat situation, the A.I. characters simply follow you around. They won't pick up coins nor help you complete any mini-games.  Rounding out the Shrek 2 experience are some mini-games that you'll have to complete when you aren't traveling on hazardous paths from point A to point B. Challenges that require your entire party include having to punch chickens into cook pots or a pen (a fairly annoying task), escorting characters through a stage (Billy Goat Gruff and the three blind mice), and collecting fairies, jewelry, etc. These aren't necessarily difficult, but since you usually are dealing with a dozen or more items, it's annoying that your A.I. controlled partners simply follow you instead of actively helping.       The second type of mini-game, dubbed ~Hero Time,~ gives one character a challenge to complete -- usually emphasizing that character's particular skills displayed in the movie. Donkey at one point has to chase a fleeing onion wagon well riding on the back of Dragon. Fiona holds a private concert for a flock of black birds she's collecting for a pie (via exploding them by rhythm based button presses). Shrek has to throw a bunch of thugs into a paddy wagon. Again, they aren't all that challenging, but they are amusing and really help the pacing of the game. Shrek 2 is surprisingly fun and polished. There aren't too many faults to be found other than a few annoying chicken puzzles, the difficulty, and some camera issues. Shrek 2 is always there to lend you a helping hand, whether you want one or not -- but this can be forgiven because it was strictly designed for a younger audience. The controls are responsive and generally don't pose problems. The real issue with Shrek 2 is the camera. At some points it's locked in a fixed position and at other times you can change the direction that it faces in, but you are never given full control. This leads to you wandering around looking for the next puzzle to solve because you can never quite see what you need to or it throws off your sense of depth causing you to miss jumps. More camera control would be appreciated, but since any death will restart at the beginning of that segment, it doesn't screw you over. GraphicsShrek 2 won't dazzle you like Metroid Prime or Resident Evil 4, but its visuals are more than adequate. Luxoflux appears to have taken some liberties with the Shrek universe (probably due to hardware limitations), presenting it in a slightly different artistic light. Regardless, the character models accurately represent the movie ~stars.~ Environments are detailed, including multicolored flowers imbedded into grass textures and wood grains on trees and houses. A few spots (like water) show off muddled textures, but it doesn't break up the visual presentation. You'll also discover some rather neat morphing effects -- such as the ripples that appear on screen when Fiona engages bullet time. There's even good use of lighting and shadows.  The entire affair runs in progressive scan. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fcubemedia.ign.com%2Fcube%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F511%2F511854%2Fshrek-2-200405050740062.jpg&caption=Sound The quality of the voice acting is very good considering that it took a glance at the credits to learn that most voiceovers are provided by sound-a-likes.  A few do sound out of place, but it isn't that noticeable. These voices appear in both cut scenes and occasional one-liners (which often make you smile). Sound effects consist mostly of smashing and bashing sounds, although you'll also hear footsteps and aural warnings from fast approaching enemies. The musical score sounds like tracks that could have been pulled from the Shrek films and tempos adjust according to the situation. You might not want to run out and purchase the sound track, but the music is decent. All can be heard in Dolby Pro Logic II. I dreaded playing Shrek 2 -- partly because it was another movie licensed action adventure aimed at a younger audience and partly because of the disaster that was the original Shrek game. But, Luxoflux did its job -- Shrek 2 is an amusing jaunt into the world of the movie. It doesn't require a lot of skill and there isn't a cohesive story, but I couldn't stop playing it. While it was certainly enjoyable, Shrek 2 does have a few problems. Your computer controlled teammates are pretty stupid. There are some down right painful mini-games. And, the camera is frustrating. But, as a whole, Shrek 2 is a fun diversion from more serious and time consuming titles. Older gamers' won't find it too stimulating -- it isn't as amusing as the original movie -- but it's worth trying if you're a fan of Shrek or are looking for a multiplayer adventure to pass your time. Recommended for the younger crowd, but mature gamers should definitely rent it first.", "date": "May 6, 2004"}
