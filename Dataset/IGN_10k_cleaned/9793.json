With that superlative out of the way, you can skip the next few paragraphs, check out the number score, and then head on over to iTunes to download the game for an affordable five bucks. If you don't make it back to read the rest of the review, no worries -- chances are, you were sucked into Peggle's awesome game play, and for that, all is forgiven.   Never heard of Peggle? PopCap Games, one of the titans in the casual space, scored a bestseller with this pachinko-style puzzle game earlier this year. Already, the game has been downloaded over ten million times. Originally retailing for $20 (there's a big holiday sale over at the official site that drops it to $10), Peggle clocks in at only $5 for the iPod, making it an absolute steal. The whole dollar versus game play ratio is considerably tilted in the customer's favor.   Using the click-wheel, you control a cannon that resides at the top of the screen. You're charged with firing silver balls into a sea of blue and orange pegs (some round, some rectangular). Eliminate all of the orange pegs and you move on to the next stage. It's a very basic premise, but that's what makes Peggle so arresting -- anybody that tries it instantly ~gets it.~ PopCap builds on this core by adding power-ups, a moving basket at the bottom of the screen that saves your ball if it happens to fall inside of it, and some very slick production values. But all the extra dressing never gets in the way of enjoying the primary game mechanic: Clear the screen.   Each series of stages is hosted by a Peggle Master. Bjorn Unicorn kicks off the game, but along the way you meet colorful characters like Kat Tut, Splork, and Warren the magical bunny. Each master offers a special power-up, unlocked by bouncing a ball off a green peg. Lord Cinderbottom grants you a fire ball that torches every peg in its path. Reinfeld the pumpkin turns the ball into a ghost that passes through the bottom of the screen and reappears at the top for one more run. None of the power-ups are zeroes -- you'll enjoy using all of them.   Something very cool happens after you nail the final orange peg. The game goes into a few seconds of overdrive, called ~Extreme Fever.~ The ball slows down, the soundtrack blasts a full-choir press edition of ~Ode to Joy,~ and bonus point opportunities are everywhere. Additional blue pegs ratchet up your score and the bottom of the screen is filled with receptacles that offer big bonuses. It doesn't matter if it's the first time you see ~Extreme Fever~ or the seventieth, it's awesome. Touches like this are what made Peggle one of the bestselling casual games of the year. It just shows that somebody at PopCap knows exactly how to orchestrate pay-off.   The sheer value in the package is excellent. Seeing PopCap squeeze so much stuff into this single iPod download (55 levels, bonus challenges, duel mode) really underlines their commitment to quality. But none of this content would matter if Peggle wasn't any fun to play. The click-wheel is a great controller for this game -- it's incredibly intuitive to use the wheel to position the cannon and fire. Because there is no barrier between you and the game mechanics, Peggle is a blast from front to back. You really have to hate video games to not like what PopCap is pushing here.  Peggle is simply the best game for the iPod thus far. The  game was almost built with the click-wheel in mind, offering seamless control that never interferes with play. It's also devilishly addictive -- one of those ~just one more stage~ kind of games that make a wait at the airport absolutely vanish or suddenly make a clock say 2AM. If you've hesitated to buy an iPod game out of fear it wouldn't be any fun, Peggle is the perfect proof that in the right hands, the iPod is a legit gaming device.", "date": "Dec 21, 2007"}
