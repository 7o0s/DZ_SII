Which makes it curious why Nintendo bothered releasing Metroid again as a 20 dollar ~Classic NES Series.~ Perhaps its for kitsch value, so that collectors can have themselves a box that uses the old-school NES pixel Samus. Whatever the reason, it's tough to recommend this game over the ~free~ version already offered, since I'm pretty sure most people already into the Metroid series has snagged a copy of Zero Mission anyway.  Then again, you consumers have proven me wrong before with the sales numbers Nintendo posts on these games... Metroid is the first outing of our heroine bounty hunter Samus, though it's a secret in the first game that she's a girl. (SHHHHH!) The early days of Nintendo games meant that presentation was relegated to the cutting room floor in favor of gameplay due to cartridge restrictions, so the only storyline you're going to get out of this game is the text after the title screen. That's it. Metroid's difficulty pretty much comes from the fact that the game in no way offers any help whatsoever. You have to pretty much figure out the course of the game as well as realizing what's necessary in getting to the next portion of the area. Grab the morphball at the start and you're ready to go. There's no map to help you, or indicators to point you in the right direction. The game is difficult and long, and in many times it's very confusing. But at the time of the game's original release it was a very unique design.  The action is also very tricky and challenging too due to Samus' restrictive movements. She can only fire up and sidways, so it's a little tricky when an enemy that's shorter than her horizontal blaster gets too close. True to the Metroid spirit, there are extras that can be discovered along the way which will make Samus much more powerful, but it's knowing where they are that makes the adventure that much harder.  NES Metroid is a true Nintendo classic and is still a great game, but it's just absolutely mind-boggling why the company opted to bring this one out instead of something in the company's library that hasn't shown its head in years. The only reason to spend 20 bills on this one is if you have no interest in zipping through the awesome GBA remake, Metroid: Zero Mission, or simply want to complete the Classic NES collection. It's not worth the purchase otherwise.", "date": "Oct 26, 2004"}
