Not enough?   It's World War II and John Welsh/Walsh is an airborne trooper of sorts. In gaming terms, this means that he's a hapless jerk that fate coincidentally sat in an exploding airplane alongside a doomed French resistance fighter. Shortly after ground fire ruptures the plane's hull, John finds himself unwillingly parachuting down to German-occupied France to undertake a secret Allied mission of extreme unimportance (he has to run forward and pick things up, though there may is a bit of shooting involved at some points).   His adventure is something like a marriage between Splinter Cell and Call of Duty, only not at all like either game. The idea is stealth-action amidst the fury of war. The reality is an interactive self-lobotomy that leaves behind slightly more intact brain matter than any given Trigger Man.   A few nondescript European environments makeup D-Day's levels. The game uses them to funnel players through an inane set of distinct missions plagued by their own handfuls of pointless objectives. These always involve grabbing that ~thing,~ putting that ~thing~ over there, or boldly walking into a specific room that may or may not contain that ~thing.~ A couple totally unmemorable characters complete with feigned gusto are eventually introduced to sugar it up. Sometimes they'll even mill about as John uses stealth and the latest in period firepower to overcome his feeble enemies, assuming they're not all preoccupied with furiously running in place and pressing their faces into a nearby concrete wall.   It's usually possible to blindly sprint through the game zigzagging past enemy fire, but eventually John might have to draw a gun or knife and madly attack to clear a path before he can continue with his objective-based jog. Too bad the shooting is clunky. Static environments and wooden death animations guarantee zero combat satisfaction, even if the game typically runs smooth and clean.   Hey! Boom! I'm sneaking! No worries. To achieve success John only really needs to focus on how he can briskly navigate this game's perilous collection of obstructions. There are dastardly rocks, permanently sealed doors, and tiny pieces of wood he has absolutely no way of bypassing. If he can manage all that and deal with the ~not quite where you want it~ manual camera system, he can certainly beat any level... Well, sort of.   It's actually possible to complete each D-Day mission and not succeed. That's because if John misses an objective he's never been notified of he'll have to start over and do the entire ridiculous thing again. Whoops!   Had WideScreen Games bothered to include a few more prompts or even a map not plagued by incorrectly positioned doors and walls, John might never have to replay anything. But then WideScreen Games couldn't even bother implementing a WideScreen mode, remember?Stop counting. D-Day came, went, and stunk.", "date": "Mar 2, 2005"}
