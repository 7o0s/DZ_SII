The PC games sold enough copies to fill Streisand's nose. Your 80-year-old, arthritic, Black & White TV-owning, Death Valley residing, one-time cannery-operating, fifty-fish-in-the-fridge grandmother is going to buy the PlayStation game. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire is going to be as heavy on the top of the charts as Britney Spear's rack. So you'd think they would have a buck or two to shell out on the game's programming. But nope, and Sony's idea of passing on the savings to you is not jacking up the price beyond $40 bills and jipping buyers on a game that they're going to buy at any cost. It's a swell game, but of limited value unfortunately and plagued by strange flaws.  Gameplay Who Wants To Be  A Millionaire is a brilliant and deceptively simple trivia game, a joy for the whole family and a challenge of wits for even the biggest brainiack. The home game dutifully captures all of the nail-biting tension and heartbreak of the series, with a few major missteps and some slack production values that constantly remind you that it's all just a game.   To its credit, the gameplay is beat by skipped beat akin to the television show. The tension in any round of questioning couldn't be cut with a chainsaw. Thanks to the development assistance from JellyVision, who really know how to step on a man when he's down (expertise learned from several incarnations of the You Don't Know Jack game show series), every given second can be stretched and wrapped around your throat. When you're stumped on a question, Regis pipes in with jibes and cut-downs that make you wish you were back in mommy's hugging arms. Even when you lose the game, the put-downs don't stop until you're half the man you thought you were.  Based on the Second Edition of the PC series, the questions are already ramped up considerably. Getting past the first five questions is as easy as writing your name on a quiz, but past that the million dollars looks further and further away every round. And that's when you're winning!  Also included are the lifeline functions, with are cleverly designed. The 50/50 almost always eliminates the two answers you already figured were stupid, leaving you still stuck in a quandary, and the Audience Response is taken from a poll done of 100 random people on the internet before the game's publishing  -- anybody who works in on the web knows how trustworthy net knobs are. The best is the Phone-A-Friend option, which uses real voice responses to give you a hint. Just like the show, the friend will quickly become an enemy as the game's voice talents ramble on about their trips to the Grand Canyon and how much this question reminds them of the time baby Stewie spit up alphabet soup -- all the while leaving you hanging, just waiting for them to give you an answer!  So what's the problem here? For one, that full price is a bit much for a game that's already sold a kabillion copies, and while we normally don't rag on a game's price (as long as the gameplay is worth it), it would have been considerate of Sony to pack in both the First and Second Editions of the PC series in a two-disc set rather than milk consumers when the next game comes out.   Outside of that, there are just funky bugs and missed opportunities here that shouldn't be in a game this big. The ~Is that your final answer?~ feature (which offers you a chance to second-guess yourself) only comes in every once in a while, and while it ramps up in the game's final question rounds, players should have been given a chance to take back their guess if they key in the wrong answer or if they rethink a question. On TV, Regis torments players with the agonizing question, but here the flow of the game is off because gamers cannot screw themselves up with a bad second-guessing.  The party game atmosphere of other game shows (particularly You Don't Know Jack) is missing in Millionaire because only one player can play at a time. Players should trade off as they reach each money plateau, but here party-players will have to wait for 15 questions before their turn. Even then, the multiplayer game is botched. Only two can play, and the entire extent of a two player game is a single question round where players try to key in quick the quickest and most correct answer to a question. Pass that puzzle, and the other players is out of the game, as the winner goes on to make his millions. Once he's done, you can play again if you wish, but player two never gets his turn. Also, the multiplayer mode doesn't skip to the next question when players are stumped. The game asked me a question about HBO's The Sopranos. That's a  fine show, but I barely get reception for basic cable, and I'm not paying premium fees for more bad reception! Thus, we were stuck randomly keying answers trying to get the question right so that one of us could play.  As far as questions go, the game is fair but simplistic. It's not fun for the whole family, because only the geniuses can really play it. There's not a difficulty setting for kids, so only buy this game for your kid if he's a Bobby Fisher. The PC game allowed players to cheat (naming yourself 'Kathie Lee' makes the game easy, while another name would make the game even harder), but that doesn't seem to affect the PlayStation game, and even then, this should be a standard mode rather than special hidden feature. Still, the ratio of sports questions isn't as much a problem as it was for our PC team since we only have this one version. Also, it's nice to get questions that are unabashed -- for a Sony game, you wouldn't expect to be asked ~Which system came first?~ and have the choices be Colecovision, Jaguar, Super Nintendo, and Sega Dreamcast.    Graphics The graphics of this game are the monochromatic glittery effects from the show, capturing all of the camera swoops and color-swirl flair. Everything should be in place, and occasionally the game looks as good as it should. Other times, however, you are reminded by the slim presentation that this is just a videogame. The biggest problem in this department is that the CD needs to be accessed all the time, so swirling effects chop up in midstream. The heavy, dramatic presentation of the show slips and slides in the disc accessing. Also, the graphic load affects the trivia, as players buy themselves extra time on the clock when they use lifelines. There is no audience to cheer you on, and just in general, the game is as bland as the show itself.   Sound Again, the presentation in the sound is slack when it needs to be strong, despite the hilariously infuriating voiceovers in the lifelines. Regis' voice quality is OK, but the show's trademark bongs and music cues are low quality. The impact is minimal when there is the potential impact of stopping your heart.       This game just loses its charm really quickly. Perhaps that's inherent in a game based on this basic TV show, but the party game isn't there, and all you have left are super-tough questions. Quizmasters may enjoy this torture, but the appeal and value of the disc is just less than more exciting quiz games. Even if you're a master of the game and you love it, the most you can ever possibly win is 40 million dollars before you're through all of the game's questions.", "date": "Jun 23, 2000"}
