While the majority of these racing titles may be average, there are a number of standout driving games that really give the gamer an incredible sensation of speed, solid controls, and an overall exciting driving experience. Games like Test Drive Le Mans, F355 Challenge, and Metropolis Street Racer surely demonstrate some of the highest quality in racing games to date on the Dreamcast. But even with these top racing titles, the Dreamcast was missing its heavy hitter, the superstar, the true flagship racing game that has garnered SEGA fans from both the arcade and console world. It seems almost poetic that the finest translation of Daytona should come in the last year before SEGA retires from the hardware tracks. Despite controls that are a bit touchy and online gameplay that can be awkward, Daytona USA 2001 is the true flagship racing game that we've been waiting for.I know, I know... it sounds so  clich I should be shot for making such acclaimed standard statements.  But I can't really express it in typed words, how much it means for this Daytona title to finally come home.  And what a way to come home; not content with just giving us a straight port of the arcade game, Genki shoves in eight tracks selectable from the get-go: the three original arcade tracks, two tracks from the Saturn Daytona CCE and three brand new tracks.  You can edit each track so you can have a variable number of laps and entry cars.  Also, each track can be altered in four different ways: normal, reverse, mirror, and mirror reverse.  In fact, one of the game's strongest points is the sheer number of features!  You can go for a quick drive in a single race, challenge your best times in Time Attack, take on a friend in VS Battle (two player only), check out replays you saved onto your VMU, and of course, the huge online play feature where you can race up to four other players online.  As good as the online play feature sounds, it's not without flaws.So here's the good news about online play: unless you get disconnected, your car is always moving at a smooth frame rate.  During my online playtesting I didn't encounter any lag that affected my control of my vehicle.  However, I can't say the same about my opponents; the cars of my opponents would occasionally ~teleport~ from one side to another.  For example, I could have a driver grinding up against the left side of my car (stop snickering, ya pervs) and a second later, he would be on my right side!  This really causes some gameplay issues when the race is close and you want to draft behind a player to slingshot ahead.  (Drafting is the ~Daytona science~ where you make your car more aerodynamic by getting right behind another car.)  Though it didn't occur frequently, this ~teleporting~ of cars, which is probably due to lag of the other players, can make online gaming a bit more difficult.  But that's just a slight nag  this is online racing on the Dreamcast, a pretty big thing, and of all the racing games, Daytona gets the royal treatment.  Not that it doesn't deserve it;  Daytona is a great arcade racing game, from both visual and gameplay standpoints.Obviously, when we talk about ~better than arcade ports~ in terms of graphics, Daytona USA 2001 blows away its original arcade brother.  Not only is pop-up literally non-existent, but added reflective effects to the cars and windows (not real-time, though), really make this one ~purty~ game.  And yes, the framerate blazes at a constant 60 frames per second.  Of course, you're going to lose a little detail to vehicles when you try the split screen mode, though the game keeps the frame rate constant.  And when you get online, you'll certainly notice a difference in the details of your opposing cars when you have four players battling for position.  But the framerate, whether in split screen and in online play, remains constantly blistering, and I believe that slow down has been obliterated from the game all together.Yes, the visuals look great, but SEGA isn't about style over substance and Daytona delivers pure driving excitement.  I have to admit that the initial default control setting is a bit ~touchy~ for my taste; maybe it's just me but you touch that pad a hair to the left, and your car starts careening to the wall.  Okay, so that's an exaggeration but I think the default analog sensitivity was just a bit too responsive.  Thankfully, you can alleviate this in the options by lowering the analog sensitivity.  Other than that, this is the classic Daytona arcade feel in all its power-sliding, rubber burning, glory.  Simulation racing fans with GT3 tattoos will probably hurl when they touch this game, so this should be ample warning to racing fans.  Realism is great, but there's something to be said about making four power-sliding turns in a row while going 120 mph.Daytona USA 2001 isn't a perfect racing game.  While you can alleviate the control problem right away, let's hope those wizards working on the Daytona online servers can work some magic so ~teleporting~ cars and the somewhat occasional disconnect drops become less problematic.  But we can finally say that that last SEGA console gets a wonderful port of SEGA's flagship racing game that we'll definitely be enjoying even when the Dreamcast takes its last victory lap.--Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 15, 2001"}
