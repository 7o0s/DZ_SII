If explosions interest you, then Bomberman GB might be the game that will light your fuse. In Bomberman GB, being destructive is constructive. This fast-paced action game (released in Japan as Bomberman GB2) requires you to use bombs to demolish enemies and objects that stand in the way of your quest.  FeaturesSingle-player or Two-player with the Game Boy Game Link (sold separately). Password save. Four different play modes. Over 48 different level stages. Excellent game control. Difficulty level: Medium to Hard. The Game  Bomberman GB offers four different playing features: Lesson Mode, Story Mode A, Story Mode B, and a Battle Mode. In Lesson Mode, a player can practice any one of the eight different levels available in the Story Modes. Once you 'die' in Lesson Mode, you are automatically returned to the Lesson Mode menu, where you can choose again from any of the levels. Story Modes A and B have similarities and differences. Both modes start out with relatively easy missions that become progressively harder as you pass each of the eight levels. Also, both modes feature six different stages in each level, with different tasks to be accomplished in each. The biggest difference between Story Mode A and Story Mode B is that in Mode B, the objects targeted for demolition must be blasted in a certain order. This can be more difficult, and can challenge even an expert bomber. The last mode is the Battle Mode. Unlike the Lesson and Story modes, this option can not be selected from the game screen menus. Instead, you must go to the Password screen and type in the secret code for Battle Mode there. Once in this mode, you can play against one, two, or three computer-generated 'bomberman' opponents. It is a fight to the finish, and the last one standing amid the rubble is acknowledged the winner. The player can set the time limit for the death match, as well as set the number of matches that must be played before a champion is proclaimed.   Once you pass through the six stages in a level, your bomberman must fight a boss in order to continue. By defeating a boss, the bomberman will acquire a tool that will help him fight future foes. For example, once you attain the whip, you will be able to send bombs rolling down open pathways to destroy hard-to-reach opponents and blockades. Additionally, in each of the stages, you may pick up tokens that will increase the blast force of your bombs as well as let you set more than one bomb at a time. These bonus features allow the player to develop new strategies in annihilating stage enemies and level bosses.   Gameplay conditions include time limits in each of the stages, three bomberman lives in each level, the option to immediately continue a stage should you 'die', and password saves that let you resume play from the beginning of a level.    The action world of Bomberman GB is shown through an overhead perspective, with the screen scrolling according to the direction of the bomberman's movements. The stages are square, and exploration is limited to the game's visible borders. Scenery varies-sometimes you navigate vegetation, other times you'll wander through rocky wasteland or crumbling columns. The enemy and bomberman characters in the game are cutely animated but lack creative expression. It would be nice to see bomberman react to some of his big kills, or to see the enemies do more than shiver and blur when attacked. There is a graphical consistency to this game that can make you feel as if you are playing the same levels over and over. This feeling of dj vu robs Bomberman of a truly unique and eye-catching visual texture.    Frantic notes played in repetitive rhythms provide the background score. Even though the music varies, it still has nondescript and synthetic feel. It is not one of the game's strongest aspects.   Sound effects fare better than the music does. Bursting bombs, snapping whips, and crackling fires are just part of the small but energetic library of noises that help create an atmosphere of adventure.    Bomberman GB's main strength is its rapid-fire, strategic gameplay. Even a veteran gamer will find that the worst enemy is the one holding the Game Boy. More often than not, defeat will be dealt you by your own hand, and you will wonder how many more times you can possibly blow yourself up. Though the Story Modes could have offered more depth to complement the breadth, there is still enough action to keep a player reasonably entertained. And of course, the Battle Mode can provide a quick fix for those looking to atomize the competition.  Bomberman GB delivers a fresh approach to the action/adventure genre. Be prepared to endure much trial and error in order to develop the necessary ~fight or flight~ skills that will help you survive. If you are looking for a game that provides a deep and provoking gaming experience, this is not the choice. But if you simply want to challenge your reflexes and get ample satisfaction out of incinerating your opposition, then Bomberman GB offers sufficient bang for your buck", "date": "Jun 22, 1999"}
