Not having a MLB license doesn't necessarily spell doom if the title is entertaining enough, but for Bottom of the 9th, no license and no arcade thrills will make it tough for Konami to stay in the game.   The Facts  Full MLB Players Association License allowing for more than 300 real players Multiple gameplay modes including Exhibition, Season, and Training (recommended for beginners)  Updated  rosters and 1998 statistics  Scenario simulations from recent baseball seasons Two players support Memory Pak compatible   Gameplay Bottom of the 9th is a challenging game which is always a good thing for a baseball sim. It's a steep learning curve to figure out all of the pitching, fielding and the super-tough batting techniques. The game isn't herky jerky, in fact the animations are quite smooth,  but the flow of the game takes some getting used to. For example, when trying to stretch a single into a double, the screen shows the computer defense casually fielding your ball, while you have to rely on a little batting helmet floating around a diamond/radar display in the corner. Just as it looks like your helmet is in there safe, the fielder unleashes a fireball of a throw and as the camera angle changes you realize that your player is still 10 feet from the base and he's out by a mile. Likewise on defense you have to realize that your players seem to lumber over to the ball but can fire a bullet just in time to make a play. All-Star Baseball has its own pace as does Ken Griffey. Bottom of the 9th has its own intricacies to get used to, but nothing about it takes away from its translation of baseball.  Anybody who plays baseball will tell you that hitting a pitched ball with a bat is one of the toughest tasks in all of sports. Bottom of the 9th seems particularly attached to that notion, for better or worse. The pitcher-batter interface is clear and easy to figure out, but the batting icon can be very slippery and hard to control. So in a fraction of a second, you're supposed to pick up the speed and location of the pitch, lineup your crosshairs with the pitching marker, and press the swing button at the right time. Even in the training mode, where you know the location and type of pitch on the way, it can still be a mystery as to how to hit safely. Difficulty hitting is significant but not necessarily a negative thing. Mastering the batting method will add quite a bit to the replay value.  The game has an interesting Scenario mode like the one found in Konami's ISS64 Soccer. You can put yourself in tight situations on offense or defense where you have to pull out a miracle to win the game or make a play to save the win in hand. Baseball fans will recognize some scenarios like last year's Cardinals-Cubs game where Mark McGwire hit his 62nd homerun. You play as Sammy Sosa trying to knock a homerun of his own in the late innings of that game.  Graphics Bottom of the 9th is not going to get by on its good looks because it has none. The game runs in low-res and has that same kind of over-filtered NBA In The Zone look to it.  The texture of the uniforms look so soft and fuzzy that you may think it looks terrible. Or, you just might love it because it looks like cloth. Because there's no MLB license, none of the teams have any identifying marks on their uniforms, but the players still look they're wearing  terricloth pajamas. Even the New York Apollo League team (Yankees) is missing the pinstripes on their home uniforms and they look no sharper. Even though the game is endorsed by the MLBPA, the back of the jerseys all read ~Drano~ or ~Drago~ or something close to that. The stadiums are strong suggestions of real Major League ballparks but like the teams themselves they look intentionally vague. The Green Monster at ~Fenway Park~ looks about 40 feet too low. There's no swimming pool in the Diamondbacks out field. The giant Coca-Cola bottle in Turner Field's upper deck is omitted. So, the lack of an MLB license not only takes away some realism from Bottom of the 9th but it also seems to have led to less attention to the overall graphic presentation.   The crappy exteriors do a disservice to the nice animations and movements of the players. Even when the players go from slow, deliberate actions to lightning quick moves, the transition is smooth and there's no drop in framerate. The players move like real players, it can just be hard to make out what they're doing sometimes because of the haze around them. But it is nice to see batters hang their heads down as they trudge to the dugout after grounding into a double play. Nice little treats like the pitcher shaking off signs and checking the runner at first out of the corner of his eye would be so wonderful if you actually see the pitcher's eyes.   Sound The music is pretty endearing. If you close your eyes, it favors the theme from ESPN's Baseball Tonight. The transitions between innings feel like a television broadcast going to commercial with the music sting and everything. The announcing is reactionary, pertinent and accurate, but never mentions any players by name. A wild throw from an infielder will bring a disgusted, ~What was he thinking?~ or ~He's gotta get his head in the game!~ The announcer calls can also be irritating when he announces the delivery of every single pitch with minimal variation. The pitch.  Here's the pitch. And now the pitch. That lack of creativity would get you kicked out of broadcasting school. Crowd reactions are appropriate but not overwhelming. I especially like the fan who waits for it to get quiet while a home player is batting and then lets loose with a distracting whistle.  Peripheral Support Sadly, Bottom of the 9th does not support the Rumble Pak or the Expansion Pak. The Controller Pak is needed to save your game stats. An average baseball game with subpar visuals is just not enough to cut it when there is no MLB license. Bottom of the 9th has a good engine and the gameplay should only be tweaked enough to make it perfect. However, no real logos, stadiums or teams affected the overall look of the game and made it seem like a surreal baseball video game experience. Almost like a hazy dream, except it was in color and there was a jabbering announcer.  My impression is that Bottom of the 9th  plays a decent game of baseball, but why would N64 owners tolerate an a ersatz Major League Baseball experience when there are better options available to them.", "date": "Apr 22, 1999"}
