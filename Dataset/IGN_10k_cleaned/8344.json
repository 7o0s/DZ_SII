Using Mayan themes as backgrounds and simplified world beats as its audio backdrop, Zuma engaged players in a simple puzzle game of timing and elimination. Zuma, by the way, was not unlike the original 1998 puzzler from which it was crafted, Puzzloop. Zuma hit XBLA one and one half years ago.   Now in April 2007, Xbox Live fans are privy to an all-too familiar game, Luxor 2. If you liked Zuma, you'll almost assuredly like Luxor 2 because, well, it's nearly the exact same game. The premise is exactly the same. The looks are exactly the same, although you progress through ancient Egypt in Luxor 2, and the vibe is the same. We've seen ideas re-used before, but this is almost too close for comfort.    Still, being nearly identical to Zuma, Luxor 2 benefits similarly from the addictive nature, ease of play, and un-offensive audio-visual nature it seemingly grafts from its predecessors. The goal of this single-player, offline game is to eliminate a string of progressing colored marbles (or balls) before they reach an endpoint. You do this by matching three or more colored marbles in the criss-crossing line. Create combos and obtain special bonuses by exceeding the three marble rule and you get rewards such as reversing the line, obtaining daggers to eliminate single marbles, using gaseous attacks, and so on. That's the basic game in a nutshell. Once you get the idea, the rest of the game repeats itself through dozens upon dozens of levels (88 in all, plus 13 bonus levels) some of which are interesting and play into the game's design, and others, well, they just function.   Havign said all that, this is how the game is pitched: ~Set, the Egyptian god of chaos, again threatens the Two Lands, and you must save Ancient Egypt from his terrible wrath in Luxor 2. Wielding the powers of Isis, battle your way across Egypt. Use your mystical winged scarab to shoot magical spheres and destroy encroaching colored spheres by making matches of three or more. Stop them all before they can reach the pyramids.~ In reality, it's a marble-based puzzle game. Who would have known by reading that text?    Unlike Zuma, players shoot marbles from a flat horizontal line at the bottom of the screen instead of a circular center piece. The small difference creates slightly less intriguing gameplay because of the less flexible shooting device and the addition of a cursor that acts like an aiming reticule for the marbles, making the game much easier than it should be.   For instance, I played through 20 levels on medium without dying once. My associate Erik put the game on high level of difficulty and had little problem progressing without much challenge. The game seems to hand you the perfect marble in all the right moments, like when you have one space left before the chain enters the exit portal. In those times you instantly get the right color. Please understand, I like winning all the time, but similarly I also enjoy a challenge.    The core game rests in the Adventure mode, described above, but gamers also can play Survival (see how long you can survive before dying), Practice, and Pharaoh's Challenge, which gives you the Pharaoh's Dagger in the level of your preference. And if you become helplessly addicted, you can check your high scores on an Xbox Live scoreboard.   Graphically, there is little to discuss. Luxor is simple-looking game with 3D objects placed in a 2D plane and uses marbles, backgrounds, and your cursor as its only visuals. Bonus items round off the visual palette with friendly, sparklely animated gems, jewelry and Golden Ankh that bounce across the screen, adding pretty little ornaments. With so many levels provided, some of them end up being pretty cool in aesthetic design, even if they don't always match up in game design. You can play this in 1080i if you dare. Audio-wise, this little game sounds a lot like the simplified soundtrack of an adventure movie, like the Mummy or Indiana Jones, and it's presented in Dolby 5.1. Also, there is this hilariously lame eagle cry that happens every so often which make me laugh and cringe in equal amounts.   Despite its lack of originality and simplicity, Luxor 2 is still great fun and works well as a XBLA game. You'll start off playing ~just a few~ levels and then get sucked into 20 or more without realizing how fast time has flown by. Sure, it's an unapologetic clone, but when you lose yourself, all track of time, and escape fully, that's the sign of a fun game.Luxor 2 isnt breaking any new ground if youre a fan of the original, but then again it doesnt have to. Why fix what wasnt broken in the first place? Offering solid and challenging game play is more important to me than possibly muddling the experience, and the puzzle Pharaohs make sure that conquering this game will be no easy adventure.", "date": "Apr 5, 2007"}
