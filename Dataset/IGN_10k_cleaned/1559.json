Fluffy, cute, and suspiciously joyful, the toys populate the bedrooms and closets of countless children across the globe.  But who knows what dark thoughts lurk behind their shiny sewn-on grins?  According to Acclaim's new 3D action adventure, these ticking time bombs harbor secret desires to mutilate those who mess with their kin.  It's a disturbing lesson players will learn all too well as they put the hurt on the evil General Viggo and crew in grand fashion.  Bizarre Creations hails from across the pond, as does their creation's, er, bizarro sense of humor.  Though the game resembles a first-person shooter in many ways, it's actually a MDK-ish third-person action/platform/puzzler hybrid that challenges players to frag the animal kingdom's fluffier members.  An elite team of plush commandos' babies were kidnapped and are in desperate need of saving.  Thus you'll battle through a flurry of stages bristling with tricks, traps, mindbenders, and legions of 'Stupid Bear' adversaries, armed with the heaviest arsenal British engineers could dream up.  A half dozen critters lay claim to the product's starring roles.  Dogs, cats, kangaroos, firefox pandas, baby dragons, and even the token penguin can all be conscripted for duty.  Each member of the gang boasts their own unique special power, such as the ability to jump higher and longer, swim without coming up for air, or burrow through mounds of dirt.  When making this selection, be aware that not only must babies be rescued by their corresponding parent type, but that some areas cannot be accessed by certain animals.  Yet while every individual's effective in his/her own right, this team becomes downright deadly when operating under the orders of General Bristol, a ghostly walrus who appears regularly around stages to counsel the troops.    Knowing that this title was a Dreamcast port, any number of things could have gone wrong during the conversion, especially in reference to the control scheme.  Luckily the former analog stick interface translates well into a perfectly playable mouse and keyboard combo.  This makes it possible for players to jog around the titanic 3D environments searching for babies, spraying hot lead all while.  And since multiple-foe encounters are the norm, you'll be all the more thankful.  Nevertheless, obstacles have to be cleared from one's path during lulls in the action through a puzzle-solving process, so brainpower's as useful as firepower on this mission.  As a neat twist, sporadically encountered teleport spheres let you swap out characters on the fly, so that a new persona's talents can be temporarily utilized to perform a specific task.  Stumble upon a tank of water while playing as Roofus the dog, for example, and it's a worthless find unless a sphere granting access to Rico the penguin can be located nearby.  Having teleporters on the playing field means that you'll never know what's coming next, since levels aren't tailored to a specific character's limitations.  Therefore the player will wind up utilizing every alter-ego in the game at one point or another, which shows sincere forethought went into the level design.  Ultimately, it's a much-appreciated feature.  Like most action themed products, however, the routine's rather basic.  The Fur Fighters travel around their world grabbing powerups and picking up bigger & better guns with which to punch holes in fedora-wearing teddy bear thugs.  That's a good thing, too, because despite their harmless appearance, foes show sincere signs of intelligence, diving and rolling to avoid gunfire and ditching their guns for hand-to-hand weapons when players draw near.  Group attacks are accordingly frenzied and upbeat, as you'll have to think on your feet and pound off rounds like a howitzer.  Still the title has its fair share of downsides.  Camera angles inhibit play at times, with the main character blocking the on-screen view.  Several stages could've been cut short and been equally as effective, yet drag on forever.  Teleporters' regenerative side-effects tone down the difficulty settings somewhat.  That stinkin' geezer Bristol hasn't learned the fine art of subtlety and blatantly gives away the answers to most puzzles when you'd rather be a tiny bit stumped.  Plus the damned thing requires a wickedly powerful video card to run at a decent frame rate in the first place.  Overall, though, play time is a positive experience.  A wonderful, whimsical personality radiates from the lavishly detailed characters and surroundings, which include villages, cities, space stations and beaver powered dams.  Cute grunt and squeak noises were used in place of speech samples, while the sound effects rank amongst the best heard from an arcade game this year.  Laughter comes easily when bears spray hunks of fluff from their rent torsos and multiplayer fluffmatches (aka deathmatches) get underway.    The bottom line being that as Fur Fighters clearly illustrates, even though pure button-mashers have become virtually extinct on the PC in recent years, it doesn't mean the genre's ready to roll over and play dead just yet.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Nov 30, 2000"}
