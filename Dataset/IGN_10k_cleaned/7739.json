But then again, most folks don't really want a cheap, generic racing game that's only sort of good. World Racing 2 is one of those games that looks pretty good in a cheap bin or as a used copy but just doesn't warrant enough driving goodness for a full-price purchase. And while Synetic's racer is a decent improvement over its predecessor, it's still not worth your money even at $19.99.   The reasons are a little harder to decipher than normal, which is what happens when you get a game that's neither terrible nor great; the finer points tend to form one's opinion over many, many hours of playing, suffering and testing. World Racing 2 is a mixture of simulation and arcade racing style. It's forgiving in a few small aspects, and it's not in every other way. For example, even though the extensive car damage models look decent and there are now more licensed cars to drive than in the original game, World Racing 2 suffers across the board from numerous issues. From its average and confusing courses and chintzy music to the middle of the road sense of speed and control, to its lack of style and distinctiveness, Synetic's racer fits the bill as a mediocre effort. It won't make too many gamers happy.      Visually, Synetic's racer improves over its predecessor. There are nice little folds that increase its visual appeal even if it's still an average looking game at best. The texture maps do a decent job to convey realism, or at least a sense of visuals that function reasonably within the frame of the game's sense of art direction. The real-time lighting is also decent as it does a reasonable job offering good shadows and reflections on the cars and environments. You'll enjoy the car damage too, which doesn't do as good a job as any of Codemasters's racing games, for instance, but gives a decent sense of broken fenders, bent panels and offers some OK particle effects. And you can play it in 480p on Xbox.    The developer also added a replay system and had the poor taste to place it right in the middle of the races. It functions like the slow-mo replay shown in Burnout or Need for Speed. Right after a big move -- a big jump, kick-ass power-slide, etc. -- the camera switches to a movie-style perspective and shows that same move over again, then switches back to the race. It's an unfortunate addition because it's poorly done. It gets in the way, distracts you from the race at hand, and doesn't really highlight anything in a manner that makes you feel cool. It actually shows how bad the car designs are from a new angle, and doesn't do any justice to the driver, the physics or the actual ~cool~ move itself.    While the countryside gives you a better than average view, the roads are strangely textured and the cars themselves are horrifically modeled. They are just horribly modeled. These cars barely look like the originals, thanks to badly proportioned designs and an almost cartoon-style artistic interpretation. Car buffs will go lunar seeing these things. The lack of good shadows under the cars -- which visually grounds the vehicles on the roads -- also breaks the suspense of disbelief. It's almost like they're all hovercrafts. Almost   From a gameplay standpoint, World Racing 2 does some things well and it also falls apart big time in some areas. I'll start with the positives. Synetic's game has a basic grounding in good car racing. That is, if you've played a lot of racing games in the past you can see through to its hardcore leanings. Basic things such as transference of weight while taking turns, realistic brake effects and increased velocity while traveling in a straight line work on basic physics properties. And they're turned into racing techniques. Thus, taking a sharp turn must be done by braking slightly before-hand or letting off the brakes, and then hitting the accelerator two-thirds of the way through the turn, so you accelerate out of the turn for maximum acceleration. If you've played Gran Turismo, you'll recognize this same style of ~realism~ in World Racing 2. The realistic-style physics aren't as good as in GT, but they work on the same premise. World Racing 2's sense of speed is also decent, but offers nothing spectacular to write home about.   This same sense of realism affects the artificial intelligence design. This game starts off relatively difficult and then just gets tougher. I don't mind the challenge but even in the first four races in this game I was finding that the AI was tough, the courses confusing, and the cross traffic killer. I don't know how many times I had to restart a game because of one random car that ruined an otherwise perfect race. Overall, the AI is actually quite good. It will pull ahead if you screw up. It will take opportunities to zip by you and it will generally drive well. For instance, I didn't see it cheat when taking turns. It seems the cars handled the road like I did, instead of using programming to unrealistically take turns to get ahead. Again, I like tough AI, and here I liked it up to a point. On the other hand, the AI, while tough, tends to be really unforgiving. Even in the first 10 races, I had to replay several races over and over again. Not a racing game for the faint hearted.   Adding to the strange AI and cross-traffic issues is the funky course design, which is not only badly laid out but poorly presented. Many races offer secondary roads or what look like shortcuts or tertiary roads that would enable you to cut time off your race and beat the snarky AI. The game is set up with a risk-reward system that unfortunately requires you to test each road several times before you figure out the right way. The way the game is presented figures into this mess. In Need for Speed Most Wanted, you could tell which roads were shortcuts because they appeared as dimmer white lines that stood out in contrast to the bolder main roads. Here, you get dozens of side roads, but many of them lead entirely in the wrong direction. And the on-screen map is so small that you can't tell where the road leads to, so each time you try one it's risking the entire race. Some races forced me to take side roads that appeared to lead in the wrong direction. Intuitively, they were totally wrong. But they ended up being the right direction to take.   I once tried to jump over a bridge in one race over and over again because the alternative road went in the wrong way. The draw bridge always led to death. In the process I learned that the programmers didn't build in any consequence for taking the bridge. My car didn't clear the distance to the other side of the bridge, fell intot the water and just floated there. If I hadn't forcibly restarted the game, I would have floated helplessly in the water, stuck in my car, forever; a lovely thought. Better testing, programming, and even subtle hints could have overcome these issues.   Finally, the music is actually so bad it's funny. If you were interested in listening to some of the cheesies and weakest techno ever -- with a Euro-trash twist to it -- than check out World Racing 2. Otherwise, play this game with your own home-made soundtrack. Anything is better than this.Synetic has a basic grounding in good car physics and better-than-average artificial intelligence, which gives World Racing 2 an underlying level of quality. Unfortunately, its poor presentation, rough course design and horrific car designs add to the game's poor sense of balance and fairness. And in the end, World Racing 2 is not a game you'll end up wanting to spend money on, whether it's as a new or a used game.", "date": "Dec 5, 2006"}
