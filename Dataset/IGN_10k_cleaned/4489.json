Already riding high on the acceptable performance of 2003's strategy game of the year, the company could have been content by holding back its translation of the follow-up for several more months -- opting instead for the summer release that the franchise so classically enjoys. But in a surprise announcement made just a few months ago, KOEI stunned the simulation world by revealing its plans to follow the Japanese release of Romance IX by less than a season. As the brass in charge wanted the world to know the team was eager to have its latest installment in American hands as soon as humanly possible.   And sure enough, just two and a half months after it was first unveiled to happy Japanese audiences, Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX has already come stateside. Marking the first time in several years that the series has changed direction and its mechanics, the game is definitely the user-friendliest of the bunch with a design that has strategy-newbies in mind. And while Romance IX is certainly just as entertaining now as it was when we first played on it on the Nintendo Entertainment Systems16 years ago, this new accessibility and slimmed down appearance could end up rubbing veterans the wrong way.   Gameplay  In a move that will no doubt baffle and excite varying members of the San Goku community, Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX returns to the same basic structure that made it so popular in the first place. Best described as a modern day reinterpretation of Dragon of Destiny and Wall of Fire, KOEI's latest installment of the series does away with varying job and officer types by exclusively replacing them with the all-powerful ruler class. Friendships, sworn brotherhoods, the ability to marry other characters, and the complication of earning various reputations are now completely gone and have been traded for one simple goal: supreme control over China.    Of course, that's been the goal in every previous San Goku Shi as well but in Kingdoms IX it's the only objective that players need to worry about. Though it should be noted that familiar supporting goals like drafting and training an army, building your city's defenses, nurturing farmland crops, and encouraging a healthy trade market are still around as they've always been. But the difference here is the ease in which players can improve upon them. Rather of place the emphasis on character progression and city development as the last few versions have, Romance IX refocuses itself on the grander scheme of expansion and warfare. Granted this concept isn't exactly a new one to the franchise, but it's difficult to deny that those elements have taken a backseat to other features in more recent years.   Because of the game's newfound focus, KOEI has gone back and rebuilt the turn structure and battle system from the ground up. To start, council meetings, season changes, and similar inconveniences no longer restrict player's actions. Gamers can now do whatever they want when they want providing they have the resources. In an effort to help, the game supplies its users with 36 turns per year (three per month) and further divides those turns into two distinct phases (action and strategy). Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX not only moves at a much brisker pace because of this, it also allows players to accomplish more of their tasks in a given month. A city improvement project that took ten years in Romance VIII should only take you three or four to accomplish now. That's a big difference in time and one that allows you stay centered on the goal of expansion.    After decisions in the strategy phase have been made, the game then acts on these commands during the action phase -- allowing officers to leave the city to search for future colleagues, transfer soldiers to other locations, and invade neighboring enemies to take their land. These movements are played out in real-time too, so players can actually watch their regiment as they cross open fields or mountains and gain position on their targets. Simultaneously, it also allows users to spot any possible reception parties or likeminded invading forces so that they can alter their plans and meet them. This one change to your pre-battle movement marks a huge turning point in military planning compared to previous titles and is one of the best additions the franchise has seen yet.   But the changes to the battle system don't stop there. Once engaged in a melee, players can adjust their formations to combat specific situations. Moving quicker, establishing projectile defenses, protecting yourself against traps, and other such maneuvers are now inherent to whatever formation your party chooses; and when coupled with round-by-round decisions can turn the tide of war in your favor even when things seem doomed. The improved list of special skills known as tactics are particularly useful in these situations and are ripped directly out of KOEI's other big strategy title, Dynasty Tactics. For the uninitiated, these special skills can give your soldiers all sorts of neat abilities -- like stronger arrow attacks, the use of elephants, and improved naval performance -- while lowering your casualties considerably in theater of war. Some can even be chained together for additional battlefield damage and if you have a big enough chain attack going, players can completely decimate another unit in one turn. And yes, we've seen it happen.    Perhaps one of the coolest new features to the battle system, though, is the ability to build new structures to aid you for defensive stands. Camps and outposts increase your soldier's important numerical attributes while compounds add towers for increased archer range. Should players want to barrage their opponents with catapults, they can construct huge forts in order to assist them or just take the easy way out and build a myriad of different obstacles to slow their opponents down long enough to starve them. The sheer amount of available strategies here are simply mind-blowing.   But it's not just the strategy that makes Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX so enjoyable. There are a ton of other little factors that contribute to that as well. Whether it's the ability to import save files from Dynasty Tactics 2 and Dynasty Warriors 4 to unlock specialized secret characters, or the included theater and concert modes that allow players to watch and listen to their favorite movies and music, there's always a little something extra for fans of the Three Kingdoms experience. Fanatics will definitely appreciate it.   Unfortunately Romance IX runs into an interesting problem. Because of its finite focus and loss of various character classes, it also loses a lot of its customization and depth that the prequel so overflowed with. Without the ability to start rivalries, marry into other kingdoms, or choose your own level of responsibility it almost feels as though the game is only half as big as it used to be. And these facets of your interpersonal relationships aren't the only things that are missing either; storylines, endings, and similar prospective goals have all been cut down to a minimum while the amount of playable scenarios has shrunk from 50 to just a bit over 20. That's not just the illusion of loss folks, that's the reality of it.    It's also a little disheartening to report that the Romance series still hasn't taken any steps towards moving online -- as some kind of compatibility in that department would have more than made up for the scenario selection. And while we could go on all day about the myriad of other little missing elements we liked so much in Romance VII and Romance VIII, we'll put it the simple way and just say that we found it an odd move to sacrifice half your previous feature set in favor of an all-new battle and turn system (though admittedly, they do kick ass).   Graphics  The San Goku series has never won any graphical contests and Kingdoms IX isn't going to be the first to buck that trend. But in a strange step backwards for the entire franchise, the visuals in this latest sequel are actually less impressive than those of Romance VIII. Already 16-bit quality to begin with, these newer characters have even less detail and animation than they did before and with the loss of officer duels and in-city views of your empire, the game has fewer reasons to stray away from the constant display of mathematical groupings and menu trees. But at least layers are occasionally treated to cinematic overlays comparable to those of Dynasty Tactics; so at least there is some form of visual diversion other than the occasional information screen.   To its credit, the menu system and map area are much easier to navigate and offer subtle effects like fogging, shadowing, and more realistic season changes. So while the cities and war segments are definitely less impactful than they were before, the overall environment has made a strong change for the better. Obviously there was a conscious decision to make some visual sacrifices in different areas once the new gameplay direction of Romance IX had been established -- we're just not so sure that the choice to make the Map a priority over battle screens and city views was the right decision.    At the end of the day, though, it seems that the area most hurt by the slimmed down visual presentation was the CGI cut scenes. Practically non-existent when compared to previous versions, the animated cinematics are so few and far between that most users will likely forget about them altogether. Truthfully and on a more personal level, we're really not that stunned or disappointed by all these visual cuts in the least -- as the depth of gameplay is always what's foremost on our mind. But on the flipside, we'd be lying if we said that weren't a little bit baffled by the developer's decision to actually move backwards in this regard rather than to hold its ground and keep the same level of detail that was established in 2003.   Sound  In keeping with a tradition we've certainly come to appreciate, Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX has improved its soundtrack for the ninth game in a row. Utilizing the talents of a full orchestra, the game's Chinese fantasy thematic sounds absolutely awe-inspiring -- with a terrific mix of epic movie-like chamber music and plenty of flute-heavy love ballads. There are more than 20 different tracks in all too, with each one assigning itself extremely well to various situations. The seasons, the size of your empire, and even particular scenarios all have specific trademark tunes and are as individually powerful as that of a Final Fantasy title. If that isn't a testament to the quality of the game's music, we don't know what is.    One tradition that we're not so appreciative of, however, is the series' other nine-game audio streak -- the quality of its sound effects. Though definitely an improvement over the 16-bit clings and clangs of Romance VIII, the supporting audio in Kingdoms IX is still nowhere near the level established by other modern software. We figured (as many of you probably have) that the added storage space provided by the DVD format would encourage KOEI to be more aggressive towards improving its past shortcomings; sadly that just doesn't seem to be the case.   But at least the narrative voice-overs are well acted and are performed in Chinese rather than Japanese or English. It adds truthful dose of much-needed authenticity and when coupled with the terrific music we mentioned earlier, helps us to overlook the lack of Dolby Pro Logic support and the so-so sound effects.KOEI always seemed to understand that the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series wasn't meant for everyone, and perhaps that explains why this ninth installment has such a dramatic simplicity. Though it's definitely not too easy or too mainstream (ala Dynasty Tactics) to put off the hardcore, we can tell you from the outset that fans of last year's game may not like it. Instead, more recent franchise supporters may find that they preferred the immense micromanagement and city building to that of quickly paced warfare and uncomplicated expansion. Truthfully there's no wrong way to go, as both titles are simply different in their emphasis and are meant to appeal to those with divided tastes.At the end of the day, however, Kingdoms IX does manage to offer a couple of terrific new gameplay elements that the brand has needed for quite some time -- the battle engine and real-time army movement in particular. But with the substantially smaller set of features and a lower visual quality in comparison to last year (not to mention the continued neglect of online play) there's no way to hide the fact that we're more than a little disappointed.Nitpicks and wishlists aside, Romance of the Three Kingdoms IX is still a terrific and involving strategy game that is definitely worth a look. If you're new to the series or the genre and have ever wondered what it would be like to conquer ancient China, we can't think of a better introduction than this.But just be prepared for a possible shift back to the complicated next year; as we're told that KOEI is looking to revamp the series quite considerably once again. We hear that the team has big plans too, which is fine by us -- we have big hopes.", "date": "Feb 24, 2004"}
