Of course, we all got past Middle School and realized that society at large thinks this is a load of crap, but it'd be kinda nice if it proved true somewhere.  Enter Rockstar's first DC effort, Wild Metal.  Somewhat of a next-gen ugly duckling, this game has existed in the back of Dreamcast gamers' minds for the longest time, but because it disappeared from the public eye for a time after being scheduled as a launch title, many don't really know what it's all about. I think it parallels Body Harvest for Nintendo 64 in some ways. Not that the game itself is similar, but that both of them dodged in and out of the public eye for a time before actually reaching production. Because of this, Body Harvest fell through the cracks. I'm hoping the same doesn't hold true for Wild Metal, as it certainly deserves attention.  Compared to most Dreamcast titles to date, this game is ugly as homemade sin, and as a result, will get passed over by many a gamer.  Whether or not it achieves main stream success, Wild Metal is definitely one that will be remembered by many as a true hardcore gamer's game. What the game lacks in flash and glitz it makes up for in hardcore gameplay and brutally involving physics -- However, many won't really ~get~ the game at first, and some won't ~get~ it at all... WM is very unique, and, in some ways, very reminiscent of old 8 and 4 bit games. For instance, upon turning the power on, you are offered no explanation of the game. No cut scenes. No dialogue. Nothing human ever even appears on screen. You just start the game, and without any ado, are slapped onto the playing field, without any objective presented, and without any explanation as to who you are or what you're doing. This, in itself, may serve to alienate some -- As it did with me -- But if you keep at it, you'll soon find yourself playing an intricately designed and infinitely involving game.  Funny thing is, Wild Metal does have a plot, but it clearly isn't integral to the gameplay experience, because if you never read the manual, you won't even know that there is any kind of story to the game at all. It follows something of a Matrix-esque plot. Basically, centuries ago, deadly automated machines were established on the three planets of the Tehric system to protect the various colored power cores from invaders. We're not told why we need the power cores, but because they emit a lot of colorful light, we're assuming they're important. Anyway, the machines turned out to be designed too well, because, as machines tend to do, they became self aware, and soon got it in their pesky robotic heads to wipe out all biological life (I had quite an episode the other day when my blender attempted this).  As things always seem to in these games, the fate of all life in the solar system comes down to one man.  And guess who plays that man?  Oh yes.  Grab up your treads and prepare for war, little Johnny.  Piloting one of five imaginatively designed tanks, you are deployed onto key points of the three planets to retrieve the power cores which will somehow make everything happy again.  The goals are the same in each level, simply retrieve the cores. But doing so becomes increasingly more difficult, and requires more and more cunning and elaborate thinking as the game goes on. At first, it's simply a matter of picking them up. But the level designers didn't wait very long before getting sneaky, as once you're a few levels in, you'll find yourself pulling off more and more out-there stunts to get to a capsule -- Or somehow move it so that you can get to it. There are times when it gets pretty frustrating and even repetitive, but that's just a part of the experience, as the game was designed with the truly relentless gamer in mind.  The basic control may conjure up a whole number of mixed emotions at first, but ultimately is extremely well crafted, at times, even ingenious. I played around with the controls a bit, but ultimately decided the default controller setting was the best. The stick moves your tank, the L and R buttons operate the turret (which doesn't seem immediately useful, but definitely is later on), digital pad selects weapons, Y and A move the camera, B fires, and X lays a mine. The interesting part about the firing is how it works -- Holding the fire button causes the turret to aim upwards, and letting go fires. The longer you hold, the higher you will aim. At first this seems a bit weird, but as with most aspects of the game, soon is found to be indispensable. For anyone who has played the PC classic Scorched Earth, some of the battle in Wild Metal seems to give a nod to it. Hitting your targets, stationary or moving, requires a great amount of skill, as you must time your release just right to get the right trajectory. When you consider the extremely radical terrain, the accurate physics, and the multiple stationary and mobile targets shooting at you at once, the whole experience is quite involving.  The game isn't without its shortcomings, the main of which being the graphics. There aren't many blatant mistakes, but the overall scheme is very simplistic. The terrain consists mostly of the same simple textures repeated, and the tanks themselves are pretty blocky looking. Considering the overall absence of detail, it's disconcerting that the frame rate suffers whenever there's more than a little action on the screen.  On the whole, Wild Metal is a very fun and rewarding experience. The graphics are sub par and the learning curve is kind of steep, but for those who consider themselves hardcore gamers, it's really a must-play. I commend Rock Star for spending the time to get the gameplay so ~tweaked~. A game like this one with top-notch presentation and graphics would truly be to die for. Here's to a sequel..?  -- Matt White, Wild Contributor", "date": "Feb 1, 2000"}
