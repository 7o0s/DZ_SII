It is a strategy that has continued to work - despite mediocre review scores, Wii Play is month after month a top-seller on the Big N's console and now the publisher just might be able to repeat the successful formula with a brand new peripheral and an accompanying demo that is far more interesting. Of course, we're referring to Link's Crossbow Training, which comes packaged with the Wii Zapper for only $19.99. It's a good price, but exactly what does the money get you? The answer is a highly entertaining, although relatively shallow shooting game set to the backdrop of the beloved Zelda universe, and a hunk of plastic - a shell of a controller, literally, meant to house the Wii remote and nunchuk in a gun-like holster. In a way, the package is the polar opposite to Wii Play, whose main selling point was most certainly the remote itself. Here, the demo - Link's brief revisiting of the world from Twilight Princess, crossbow in hand -- is worth more rupees than 10 Wii Zappers.   Take control of Link to target the enemies in this stage.  We've been very vocal about our dissatisfaction with the Wii Zapper and Link's Crossbow Training does little to change that. The fact remains, the peripheral is just a shell and a rather shabby, flimsy one at that. You simply plug the Wii remote and nunchuk into it and voila - you have a light gun or, that's what you're supposed to believe. The Zapper obviously does not transform your Wii remote into a classic light gun, though - it just simulates the experience. You still target with an on-screen reticule and the position of said reticule is determined by the angle of your Wii remote to the console's sensor bar - same as before. Novice players may find the Wii Zapper more approachable than a standalone remote because it gives the impression of holding a real gun. But if you're adept at all with Nintendo's controller, you will quickly discover that the Zapper actually slows your aiming speed and accuracy - this, because you have to use your arms to target; utilizing only the Wii remote, precision aim can be had with simpler and quicker wrist movements.  The Wii Zapper isn't an exclusive controller shell. Games like Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles, Ghost Squad and especially Medal of Honor Heroes 2 have all been designed to take advantage of the peripheral. The novelty of playing with the Zapper is entertaining for a short while. Ultimately, however, all of these games are better without it, and so is Link's Crossbow Training. Indeed, one of the gameplay styles in Nintendo's shooter makes using the Zapper particularly cumbersome, but we'll get to that.   Link's Crossbow Training features about 10 stages and can be completed in less than an hour.  In spite of our reluctance, let's call it, to accept the Wii Zapper, we wholeheartedly welcome and indeed quite enjoy the addition of Link's Crossbow Training to Wii's library. Although incredibly short - about 10 quick and easy levels comprised of three sub-stages apiece - this shooter from Nintendo is also a great deal of fun. As an added bonus, it makes strong use of the Zelda: Twilight Princess universe so that you will see many of the famous landmarks and enemies from the adventure title, only re-imagined as scenarios more suited to light-gun-style shooting. There are three gameplay types in Crossbow Training, including on-rails action where you need only point and shoot at scrolling targets and enemies; segments where Link is stationary, but can turn in 360 degrees if you drag the Wii remote to the corners of the screen. And finally, areas in which you must fully control Link using the nunchuk's analog stick and target enemies with the Wii remote. All three play scenarios are engaging and entertaining due in large to tight controls and very interactive backdrops.       If your only goal is to complete the game, you will whiz right through Link's Crossbow Training in less than an hour. However, there's good reason to come back and play again. The best players will strive for gold and platinum awards, which are only handed out if you score 60,000 points or more in each three-tier stage. And the only way to do that is to link together crossbow combos - done simply by successfully shooting enemies and targets in succession without missing. It's when you amass a 20-plus combo and your points really start to multiple that the game becomes much more satisfying. And on top of everything else, Link's Crossbow Training features its share of point-related secrets, whether you're shooting pumpkins and doors to amass extra points or to release hidden watermelons, or targeting chickens for a loss of points. There's a little more skill and a little more depth in the shooter than you might initially believe.  It looks like Twilight Princess, but lacks the scope of the adventure game.  It's not a perfect shooter by any means, though. Since only one mode enables you to control the camera with the nunchuk's analog stick, you will in some cases - particularly during the game's balloon target stages - really strive for the abi8lity to simultaneously shoot targets and move the camera, but alas, you won't be able to do that. Instead, you'll be forced to drag the screen with the Wii remote, which is slower - a problem when time and timing are necessary. Meanwhile, when you are able to control Link through environments, you will find that doing so is more difficult than it needs to be using the Wii Zapper, which makes hard turns around corners more mechanical. And not to be ignored, the title includes a two-player mode, but it's not designed for simultaneous play - a misstep, as far as we're concerned.  Shoot the targets. As a standalone product, I wouldn't buy the Wii Zapper. It doesn't do anything for me. But I wouldn't pass up the chance to own Link's Crossbow Training. It's a short, but nevertheless fun demo that reunites Zelda fans with one of Nintendo's greatest icons while simultaneously providing a new way to see the lands and enemies that Link explores and fights respectively. The shooting mechanics are well done and the visual presentation looks like something right out of Twilight Princess  which, obviously, it is. I would have preferred more stages and more options, but for $19.99, I'm a little more forgiving. As an interesting aside, I would definitely be keen on buying future demo games of this type on Wii if they were also priced for the bargain bins.", "date": "Nov 20, 2007"}
