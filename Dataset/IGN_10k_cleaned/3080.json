With their newest, we finally have the chance to get into the fun of creating our very own Disney experience with themes and characters that we all know and love. The game itself really hasn't changed much aside from that, meaning it's still fun and easy to use, even if it is a little shallow in the gameplay department.   First off, Ultimate Coaster isn't going to win any awards for unique gameplay or graphics. In fact, when it originally came out, there wasn't a whole lot to really make it look like a complete package game. It didn't and still doesn't have a story to keep you moving, but with Disney Coaster, you will have something to at least hold the challenges together. Imagineering Mode gives you various scenarios that give you the chance to learn about building coasters. It also manages to provide a little bit of fun and challenge by providing goals you must keep while building your coaster, such as passing the coaster through a set of gates while making sure the train will make it all the way around the track. These scenarios are presented to you in three different areas of the Disneyland Themepark. You'll have to complete those in Toontown, Frontierland, and Main Street. Of course this also means a healthy dosage of theming in the form of objects that you might find in these areas.   I wish there was more theme objects for each of the different areas... there's only so many times you can place the same building or crooked tree on a ride without it getting a little dull. Still there are more than there used to be and the new objects are nice. Along with the regular 3D objects are special effects and sound placements. These can be stuck to the track so that they're triggered by the train, or they can just be ambient and go off the entire ride. With a little creativity and well placed items, you can create a pretty imaginative ride for your own from scratch coaster, or one for the scenarios.   Each of the scenarios begins with an intro dialogue that's crisp and clear and sounds like it came straight from Disney. Go figure. A brief explanation of the challenge will be given and are cute, though you can tell they were directed at the younger crowd. You'll need to compete in a slolom in Frontierland by building a coaster that must enter through one side of several gates spaced out around the area, build a coaster on Main Street that'll give the crowd something to cheer about with a spectacular fireworkds show, or even help Donald build a coaster to take Daisy out on a date around Toontown. While these aren't exactly challenging feats, they do what they were meant to by providing a fun atmosphere for learning how to create exciting coasters. While the intros and ideas behind these scenarios are cute and playful, it lacks the complexity of games like Roller Coaster Tycoon. The challenge is more just working with your own creativity to make a great ride for yourself as beating these levels isn't exactly difficult. There's almost never any need to actually make the coaster fun as long as it meets the objectives.   Most of the time, you'll spend building your own crazy coasters in the free build mode. You can choose from several ride types and terrain types to build your rides. The selection isn't anywhere near the size you'll find in something like Roller Coaster Tycoon, but it gives enough to play with for the casual player. You'll find yourself adjusting rides here and there just to give them that extra oomph. And that's really where the game is very good. The interface and build mechanics for the coasters is excellent. Your coasters can go any which way without too much effort so building a massively creative ride is fairly simple as long as you have the time and interest to do it. Building and adusting the length, curve, and height of the pieces of track is simple as pie. You can even go back and adjust little things way back at the beginning of your ride and have the game adjust the rest of the track accordingly. Of course, this could potentially ruin some turns and twists down the line, but that's what testing is all about. At least you don't have to delete half of your ride to fix one stupid little thing.   You'll also be able to ask for advice and opinions from several of the most memorable Disney characters like Pluto, Goofy, Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, and Donald. After you've tested your ride and planted all of the extras like scenery around the map, you can choose which characters you would like to critique your ride. Then take your coaster out for its first spin. After it's done, you'll get each of the character's opinions through a portrait that shows their pleasure, horror, or nausea, and a little mouse-over text message that clearly explains their thoughts. They'll tell you if they thought it was too crazy or nice or absolutely terrific. It isn't all that complicated, but it does make the rating game a little more fun. I'm a little surprised that they didn't model a 3D character for each of the judges and have them sit on the ride with you. You can see the train and the other cars, why not the characters too?Ultimate Ride: Disney Coaster isn't a complex game. Actually, it's hardly even a game so much as a tool for building coasters. But it is very good for that and can be a heck of a lot of fun, especially for the youngsters that need something that doesn't involve guns. You and your kids could even have great time playing building coasters together. It probably isn't something you'll get as addicted to as you did to Roller Coaster Tycoon, but you'll be able to whittle away plenty of hours playing around with it. Now we just have to get Chris Sawyer and Disney together to create Ultimate Coaster Tycoon and we'd have the best of both worlds. Just don't cross your fingers on that one.", "date": "Oct 18, 2002"}
