With that known, it's not that big of a surprise that the game's sequel, Chrono Cross, has been one of the most highly anticipated games for PlayStation in the United States for quite some time.    For those that have been eagerly awaiting the English version of this game, the wait is over and it's safe to say that it has been well worth it. Chrono Cross has turned out to be one of those rare gems that manage that have all the qualities needed in order to make a truly memorable role-playing game experience. It does just about everything really well and does many things better than the original ever been did before. If you're a fan of RPGs, there's no doubt that you'll be pleased with this game and owe it to yourself to go out and buy it at your earliest convenience. If you're not yet convinced of this game's glory, then read onward and you'll hopefully get the convincing that you require.   First and foremost, the storyline in Chrono Cross is probably the most ambitious that any has ever been carried out in a console RPG, with the possible exception of Xenogears. However, unlike Square's other PlayStation RPG, Chrono Cross isn't plagued by a less than stellar translation job that makes a complete mess of what was already a very intricate and complex storyline. The writing quality of Chrono Cross is exceptional and is nearly as good as the brilliant job that was done by the team responsible for Vagrant Story.   What makes all of this even more impressive is that Square was able to give each of the game's 40-plus playable characters different characteristics and, in many cases, distinct accents and speech patterns. The accents were handled surprisingly well and most were pretty consistent throughout the entire game. That combined with the fact that each of the characters in the game plays an important role in the plot of the story help brings them to life as individuals. The character development isn't the best you'll find in an RPG, but it's better than most.   Without spoiling anything, the plot is very elaborate and deals with many issues, such as humanity's role in the destruction of the environment and how fate plays a role in our lives. Plus, it brings forth the idea of parallel worlds and how the outcome of one's life can be greatly effected by what happens during certain significant events in one's life. All of this has been pulled together nicely and the end result is one of the most intricate plots that one will ever encounter in a videogame.   The single greatest aspect of the game's storyline is that it ties in so closely with that of its prequel, Chrono Trigger. Unlike most RPG sequels where the only similarities come in the form of similar item or equipment names or mentions of older characters, the plot of Chrono Cross is very closely intertwined with its predecessor. To give any details would spoil major story points of the game, so we'll leave it at that.   Whilst the game is tied closely to Chrono Trigger and players who have played through the first adventure will definitely get a lot more out of the game than those who haven't, the story still stands well on its own. There are a large number of plot revelations made throughout the game that will have player screaming out explicatives, such as ~Oh my god!~ ~Holy Sh!t~ and ~What the f---?~.   Gameplay Chrono Cross matches its involving and well-told storyline with what stands as one of the coolest battle systems ever conceived for a traditional role-playing game. The game not only removes the annoying random battles that are the bane of existence for RPG gamers around the world, but it also has made it where it's quite easy to avoid nearly all of the non-critical battles in the game. Monsters can be easily avoided on the overworld map and even in cases where you do accidentally run into one, the game enables you to run away from any of the game's battles.   The idea to have the monsters onscreen and avoidable has obviously been done before, the game's prequel, Chrono Trigger, and the Lunar remakes come to mind, but it's never been handled as well as it is in Chrono Cross. Forced battles with minor enemies are quite rare and it's actually possible to go through the game with more fights against boss characters than regular monsters. It not only takes away the displeasure associated with random encounters, but it increases the player's ability to further the game's story progression at their own pace.   What's the kicker is that the battles in Chrono Cross are actually quite fun and are a joy to partake in. The game makes excellent use of several features including stamina points, field effects, an element grid, and innate attributes in what all add up to a deep and attack and magic system. During battles, players can choose to attack, cast an elemental spell, defend or run.   While that's obviously not too noteworthy and doesn't really stray from the typical RPG formula, the way that the attacks and elements are handled and intertwine help set it apart from the rest of the bunch. When attacking, the player is offered three attack settings, including fierce, strong, and weak. The strong attacks will cause more damage, but will be less likely to hit the target, while weak attacks will cause less damage but have a greater chance of connecting with the enemy. Plus, each attack performed takes away from the character's stamina points and when the point total is less than one, the character can no longer carry out any moves.    All of this is combined with a cool elemental-based magic system that makes use of different elemental types including Basic Elements, Consumable Elements, Tech Skills, Summoning Elements, and Trap Elements. The Basic, Consumable and Trap elements can pretty much be used by any of the game's characters, while the Tech Skills are character specific and the Summoning Elements are only usable by characters of the same attribute.   Six color types represent the properties of the elements with three pairs of opposing elements: Red/Blue, Yellow/Green, and White/Black.  Black elemental spells will be more effective against characters with an innate attribute of white, while that same character will be less susceptible to white elemental spells. Because of this, the proper selection of party members and the spells that you put in their elemental grid play a significant role in your success against each boss. If you're going up against a boss that has strong white elemental magic and you have a party comprised of characters all with the white attribute, then prepare to be spanked. There's just an insane amount of strategy that goes into properly selecting your party members and determining what elements you should place in their elemental grid.   The vastness of the combat system doesn't even end there. Each of the game's playable characters can earn a variety of Tech Skills that are special to each individual character. These are learned as the character levels up and make up what are some of the game's more powerful special attacks. The game's instruction manual suggests that these Tech Skills can be combined with other characters to make up double and even triple Tech attacks, but this is actually something that I've never encountered in the game. This reinforces the notion that the game's battle system is extremely deep.   And if all that isn't enough to win you over to the winning team, Chrono Cross also has a bevy of super-powerful summon attacks that can be found throughout the game. These attacks can only be performed by the character of the same color attribute and are only doable when the entire field effect is the same color as it is. This takes some work as the player will either need to make sure at least three consecutive elemental spells are cast of the same color in a row or cast a change field spell before the summon spell can be cast. It's definitely worth it as these summons can do some major damage and when used against bosses of the opposite color attribute can make really short work of them.   In what might be the coolest aspect of the game's combat system is that because of the stamina point system it's entirely possible to perform both standard and magical attacks in the same round. However, with each magical spell costing you seven stamina points, if you choose to perform a series of standard attacks followed by a spell, you should expect to have a stamina level in the negative range.   The only complaint that I have with Chrono Cross' gameplay is that the difficulty level of the bosses seems somewhat skewed. The bosses toward the end of the game are a bit too easy, providing the player with very little challenge, while some of the bosses during the side quests are almost annoyingly difficult. From the perspective of the game's designer, this might have been done to make sure that the story progression at the end of the quest isn't hindered by overly difficult boss battles. Nevertheless, it just doesn't seem properly balanced.   Graphics When the first artwork for Chrono Cross appeared online, I honestly wasn't that enthused. Most of what was shown didn't seem to have a lot of personality or just didn't look too visually pleasing. However, this didn't really translate over to the game, as Chrono Cross is a visual tour de force in every single way imaginable. Every single facet of the game's visuals are stunning, to say the least.   The game's pre-rendered 3D backgrounds are an example of some of the best we've ever seen on PlayStation. The texture quality of the backgrounds and characters is every bit as amazing as what Square accomplished with Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy VIII, but it manages to surpass each of those titles in the area of graphic excellence thanks to its bright, colorful and exceptionally life-like and organic feel. The other two titles seem a bit drab and somewhat boring in comparison.   Likewise, the animation quality in Chrono Cross far exceeds anything we've seen in any of its contemporaries in the RPG genre on PlayStation or any of the more advanced gaming consoles. If you compare the animation quality of the characters' movements in the game to either Grandia II on Dreamcast or Reiselied on PlayStation 2, Chrono Cross comes out on top as the clear victor. The level of detail that has been put into the animation of the characters' movements should be commended, it's just mind-boggling.   The game's backgrounds are also littered with numerous animated elements that help bring them to life. For instance, there's an animated chandelier in this library room in Viper's Manor that just helps bring the room to life. The movements of objects like the chandelier combined with other elements such as birds flying around in the backgrounds and cats roaming the landscape help make the environments in the game look and, more importantly, feel real.    Chrono Cross also gets high marks for its excellent use of special effects in the game's battles and dungeons. While the spell effects aren't quite ambitious as something you'd see in Final Fantasy VIII, they're extremely well done and they make use of plenty of cool transparencies, lighting effects, and blurring techniques. Some of the blur effects, like those used when performing Orhla's Drunk Punch spell, are just amazing.   And while Chrono Cross doesn't quite have the same quantity of CG cut scenes that we've seen in other 32-bit RPGs, such as Final Fantasy VII or VIII, but the scenes that we do see are quite good. The only negative that can be said about the game's graphics is that players will encounter some slowdown when running around towns. This doesn't ever become a problem, though, and never interferes or lessens the quality of the game.   Sound If one were to want to pick out the area of Chrono Cross that doesn't simply destroy its counterparts, it would have to be the game's music and sound. The soundtrack is by no means bad, as it's one of the best that you'll ever find on a videogame, but it stands as the weakest aspect of this brilliant game. Yasunori Mitsuda should be credited with crafting a brilliant score that does wonders in stirring the emotional strings of the players as they're playing through the game.    The only real complaint about the game's soundtrack is that while it's great while taken on the whole, it doesn't have any single track that stands out as being truly memorable. In most really good RPG soundtracks there are almost always a few tracks that really stick out as being a step above the rest, but that's not the case here. All the music is terrific, with the possible exception of the game's battle music, which can get tiring and isn't too inspiring, but the game's best music doesn't quite compete with the best found in games such as Xenogears or the Final Fantasy series.   However, it must be noted that the sample quality in Chrono Cross is far superior to what we've been getting with Square's Final Fantasy series. Even though the music is PCM, it doesn't have that typical metallic sound to it. The quality of the music samples is so good that many people might even mistake it for CD audio from a fully orchestrated soundtrack.It's been a long time since I last played Chrono Trigger on Super NES and the truth of the matter is that I've actually forgot about a lot of the game's details. The main thing about the game that I do remember is that it was one of the greatest games of its time and one of the best role-playing games ever released on Nintendo's 16-bit console. It featured a really cool concept and had a brilliant combat system that was really ahead of its time. These fond memories of Chrono Trigger helped make the game's sequel, Chrono Cross, one of my most highly anticipated games of all time on PlayStation. And with any game that's so highly anticipated and hype, there's always the possibility of a letdown. Let's get that out of the way right here, Chrono Cross was not a letdown by any means. The game has completely lived up to every expectation that I had for it and has even surpassed them in many ways. Not to be too cliched, but Chrono Cross is a truly epic role-playing game experience that has cemented its place in the annals of RPG history. It's easily one of the best RPGs currently available on PlayStation and has surpassed Vagrant Story as my personal favorite. If you're a fan of role-playing games, then you must go out and buy a copy of Chrono Cross.", "date": "Aug 16, 2000"}
