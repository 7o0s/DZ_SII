From the fun arcade action of Fisherman's Bait 1 and 2 to the more hardcore simulation aspects of Bass Landing, armchair anglers have a lot to choose from when it comes to their favorite sport on the PSX. Now, EA Sports steps up to the weigh-in with their own fresh entry, and it's actually one of the better fishing games on the system.  Championship Bass shares more with Bass Landing than it does with Konami's offerings, in that it is much heavier on the simulation than fast-paced arcade style fishing.  You need not worry about being bored though, as this game is a challenging fishing trip that will keep you playing for quite a while.  Gameplay  One of the first things you will notice about Championship Bass is the number of modes and options it has. First off is Fishing Trip. This first mode is just a relaxing trip out to the lake with no set time limit or any other restriction. You start out by choosing one of the three initially selectable lakes (a fourth can be unlocked by completing objectives in other modes), and then are multiple options for your trip. You can set the time of the month (late or early), the weather, water temperature, quality of water, fishing pressure, and the time of day you start at. After all of that, you can set out on your relaxing day of fishing.  Next up are the Career and Tournament modes. In Career you get to play through an entire season of tournaments, trying to claw your way to the top. You are unable to adjust the lake conditions in this mode, and you will also be timed (so you can't spend all day trying to catch just one fish). There are also set rules for each tournament regarding what size of fish is legal, and penalties for being late to the weigh-in.   If you place within the top ten in the overall standings in the six qualifying tournaments, you will get to compete in the Championship Bass Classic tournament. Win that one, and you unlock the fourth lake. Tournament mode is a one day tournament with similar rules as the ones in Career mode, but you are able to adjust the lake conditions.  The final mode is the cool Challenge mode. If there was any hint of arcade gameplay in this game, Challenge mode is where you would find it.  This mode gives you a specific challenge (such as catching a certain number of fish in a set time) each level. By completing these challenges you can unlock bonus lures, and you if do all of them you can unlock the fourth lake (without playing through career mode).  Of course, all of that would be worthless if the game didn't play well. Thankfully it does, even with a regular controller (it does support the fishing controller that came with Bass Landing). Casting is done in a similar way as golf games handle a stroke. You set the distance, hit the button once, and then hit it again at the right time to cast. Once your lure is in the water, you can move the rod in nearly every direction using either the d-pad or analog. Casting, reeling, setting the hook, and overall rod/reel control feels very natural (again, even with the regular controller), which is a big plus.   When you get tired of one spot in the lake, you can put your rod down and dive around in your boat. If you want to move just a few feet you can even use the ~trolling motor~, which is much quieter than the loud outboard (and won't spook the fish).  Speaking of the fish, this game probably has the best aquatic AI that I've ever seen. The fish will fake you out, short strike the hook, and generally annoy you (as most real fish normally do). This is quite different than most other fishing games and it can take a while to get used to, but that is part of the games charm. You'll keep coming back because you'll rarely see the same behavior from a fish twice.  Graphics  One of the most striking things about Championship Bass is the fact that the graphics are some of the best when it comes to PlayStation fishing games. Some may argue that the Fisherman's Bait series had great backgrounds, but that's all they were - backgrounds. Championship Bass gives you four 3D lakes that you are able to drive all around, instead of placing you in front of a specific (mostly static) area. With the exception of some underwater textures being too pixilated, and some minor draw-in when driving, the graphics are very good.  Sound  Most fishing titles out there feature very cheesy tunes. Some even have annoying banjo music that makes you want to throw your TV (or stereo speakers) out the nearest window. Thankfully, Championship Bass features soft relaxing tunes that don't get in the way of your fishing. When you hook a fish, the music changes to more exciting fare, similar to what you would normally hear on those fishing commercials or TV shows on TNN (and it really gets you into the fight). Nice ambient lake sounds such as frogs and birds chirping compliment the soundtrack. This game has it all -- unbelievably smart fish, loads of modes and options, fun gameplay, solid graphics, and good music all piled on top of EA's polished presentation (the 3D title screen is a great touch).  If you are looking for a fishing game in the sea of choices on the PSX, you can't go wrong with EA's offering. In my opinion, it's the best fishing game on the system.", "date": "Mar 11, 2000"}
