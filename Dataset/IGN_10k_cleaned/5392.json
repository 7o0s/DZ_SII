So, when we saw Asphalt: Urban GT show up on our Sanyo 8200 -- a workhorse of a phone if there ever was one -- we made with the downloading as soon as our little fingers could press the keys. And then we booted up the game. And waited. And waited. And after sitting through some mind-numbing, battery-sucking, PSone-reminding load times we finally got to play the game.   Huh.   Features:   Eight tracks  Nine licensed cars  Nitro boosts   Well, might as well get this part out of the way -- Asphalt: Urban GT is not Gameloft's bright shining star. It's far from a total disaster -- because, trust us, we've played far worse -- but Asphalt: Urban GT falls prey to the same pitfalls most handset racers trip over. Namely, a limited sense of speed and itchy controls.   (Now, is the Sanyo 8200 the flagship phone for this game? No. But a lot of people own them -- just as a lot of people are walking around with LG VX6000s, and that's hardly pushing the tech envelope anymore, either. So, even though the 8200 cannot push visuals as nice as, say, the LG VX7000 -- it's still a viable gaming phone and that means any game released on it should be held to the same standards as a game dialed in for a speedier set.)   At the onset, Asphalt: Urban GT has a lot going for it. There are eight individual tracks (with different backgrounds) for the game -- and each one is significantly lengthy. There are lots of inclines, dips, and curves -- and traffic. The course design is pretty solid, in fact -- it's too bad the controls and lack of speed thwart it at almost every turn.   One of the chief problems with handsets racers, including Asphalt: Urban GT, is that because current phones cannot accept multiple button inputs, you must choose one action at a time. Your car is always accelerating -- laying on the gas is a default move. You turn with ~4~ and ~6,~ which is hard to do with any real finesse. Drifting requires you to brake (use ~8~) and then turn, since you cannot manage both at the same time. It's hard to get down to a science, and the most successful racers use powersliding as a science.   If you press ~2~ or up on the thumbpad, your vehicle uses one of its five nitro boosts. The only way you know the nitro has been engaged is because you see a slight eruption of blue flame from the tailpipes and your speedometer jumps. You just do not notice any real jump in speed -- even of you do it from a low MPH. It's a disappointment, because Asphalt: Urban GT is supposedly all about breakneck racing.   Asphalt: Urban GT does employ a pretty neat gimmick from time to time throughout your racing career. Depending on how much of a road rager you are behind the wheel, the cops will get involved. Police helicopters will descend on the scene and cop cars will crowd the road, slowing your progress quite significantly. It's a nifty addition and offers real consequences to your level of interaction with the on-screen traffic. While many racers on handsets are devoid of other cars, Gameloft's game offersplenty of bumpers to ram, slam, and crash into.   Also cool is Asphalt: Urban GT's inclusion of licensed wheels. Each car is sort of tweaked to mirror its real-world counterpart, but that's something up for debate. However, what is for sure is the fact that each car is recognizable. Included in the game:   Audi TT Roadster  Chevrolet Corvette C6  Ford GT  Lamborghini Gallardo  Lamborghini Murclelago R-GT  Lotus Exige  Saleen S7  Nissan Skyline GT-R  TVR Sagaris   But no matter how many licensed cars or long tracks Gameloft has included, it all boils down to the fact that Asphalt: Urban GT just isn't that fun. The controls are frustrating. The lack of speed disappoints. And thanks to the limited draw-in distance of the game engine, it's often hard to see curves and dips approaching -- especially when there are other cars on-screen. After several games, you'll start to wonder if wading through the excessive load times is worth it.   We've seen screens of Asphalt: Urban GT on a higher-end handset. Needless to say, it certainly looks nicer than the 8200 -- but we've included the 8200 screens for this review to give you an idea of what you'll see on a workhorse phone. The colors are certainly bright and used remarkably well (this is Gameloft -- a firm with impeccable design tastes) and the sprites are nicely done for a lower-end handset. But the scaling routines are pokey and have a limited horizon.   Asphalt: Urban GT does have a decent amount of audio, from themes to in-game sounds. Nothing you'll want to put on your iPod, but they're pretty good tunes for a small racer.  Asphalt: Urban GT on the Sanyo 8200 is a passable racing game, but with that Gameloft pedigree, we expected a lot more. As mentioned the tough controls and lack of speed are the game's real undoing, because it has a lot going for it otherwise. I've not seen a better use of color in an 8200 game for several months and the sprite design is pretty good. Too bad the scaling routine cannot give you enough of a view, though, to get that car sprite across the finish line in a decent place.If you absolutely must have a racing game for your 8200 (or comparable handset), Asphalt: Urban GT is still your best bet. But otherwise, direct your download dollars to other titles. Chances are, several of Gameloft's better releases are on that deck somewhere.", "date": "Dec 10, 2004"}
