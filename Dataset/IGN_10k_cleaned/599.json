In fact, most sports games fanatics will find its lack of realism disappointing. However, the casual sports fan will love APS for just this reason.  Like Acclaim's NBA Jam before it, Adidas Power Soccer tends to favor arcade-style action over sim-style realism. Which isn't to say the simulation mode isn't worth checking out. It boasts a solid soccer game that features real players from the teams in the German, Italian, and English leagues, and you can play through a season or cup tournament. The motion-captured animation is spectacular, as are the detailed stadiums and players, but as a sim it just doesn't compare to the likes of FIFA Soccer '96.  Switch over to arcade mode, though, and you've got yourself a winner. Sure the arcade mode is a little beyond the bounds of normal soccer, but it's this very lack of realism that makes it so much fun. Where else could you see flaming kicks, flaming goalies(!), and kicks to the head? The special moves are all animated beautifully, with special effects thrown in just for fun. This is the two-player mode to end all it all.  OK, APS isn't the best soccer game ever made, but what it lacks in stats and teams, it more than makes up for in action. Awesome.
