The game certainly captures the scale and magic of the fantasy setting very well but it's all made up of elements we've seen before in countless other games. Over the course of the campaign, the player will find themselves confronting the standard conventions and cliches of the genre at nearly every turn.  We definitely like the main character. Where so many fantasy protagonists are optimistic, obedient and obliging bores, Elhant has an uncooperative attitude that's actually quite refreshing. Hearing him argue with the folks who are relying on his services makes for a nice change of pace. The other characters are a little more predictable but the game focuses so much on Elhant that his reactions to those stock fantasy types makes them more interesting.    Elhant's unique character makes it all the more disappointing that the developers have opted for the standard fantasy fare with the rest of the story. Over the course of sixteen missions, you'll lead the forces of the elves and their allies against a vast horde of undead warriors whose only motivation is your destruction. In addition to those two main forces, you'll also have the chance to interact and play with the race of Mechanicians (dwarves) and Cyros (ice people). Each race has it's own visual style and design quirks but they still follow the same basic rules in terms of strategy and development.  Where the demo suggested that the game would include some interesting intersections between the fantasy world and our own (read: tanks fighting dragons), there's absolutely none of that in the final version. That's a real shame, too, because it would definitely set the game apart from the rest of the forgettable fantasy RTS games that we've played. The end of the game obviously sets up a sequel where we may finally see those elements appear but, for most gamers, that's too little, too late.  The sixteen-mission campaign begins with Elhant's initial involvement against the undead armies that are invading his world. From the temperate forests of his initial encounter, Elhant will find himself traveling to snowy passes, underground caverns and a variety of other stock fantasy locations. The missions are all fairly long and involved but, unfortunately, the objectives aren't always very clear. You'll often be presented with short dialogues that outline some immediate goals, but the overall point of each mission should be spelled out a little more specifically.   The game also includes a skirmish mode where you can play as any of the four races in the game on any of three different maps. More maps would definitely have increased the appeal of the skirmish modes. There's multiplayer as well but it's limited by the same dearth of maps. Non-campaign play requires the player to choose between using just the powerful hero unit, or sacrificing him to create workers that will allow for a more RTS-like experience.  You'll see the game marketed as a unique combination of RTS and RPG gameplay. This has been a very common claim made by many developers and publishers over the last few years but all it amounts to is that some of your RTS units will persist from mission to mission and will grow in power. Everytime your hero kills an enemy creature he'll gain experience. Gain enough and you'll be able to pick a small upgrade to one of your abilities -- defense against certain weapon types, faster attack speed or range, more health, more mana, etc. You can further refine your character by buying or finding magic cards that you can use for additional special abilities.  Your heroes can also be developed by purchasing and equipping unique items. Since most of these items have drawbacks as well as advantages, you'll find yourself tinkering with your inventory quite a bit before you find the right balance of items.      Players who are expecting to face an enemy who plays by the same rules will be disappointed in the main campaign. Instead of facing off against other bases and settlements, you'll merely be hunting down a series of monster generators located around the maps. Since your enemies don't seem to rely on resource collecting to produce wave after wave of units, you'll do well to launch immediate attacks in whatever direction the enemies are coming from. Otherwise, you'll have to endure endless waves of undead soldiers who will eventually overpower your forces.  The AI of the units seems to be restricted to frontal attacks. The small bands of enemies scattered around the maps won't move unless you attack them and even then, they'll pursue for a while and then give up and go back to their starting location. You can even take shots at them as they march back and they won't turn around to defend themselves until they get back to their original position. You can use this exploit to take out massive forces with only a handful of troops.   The game makes use of different types of scenes to tie the missions together. The full CG segments are by far the best. The voice-acting might not be the best but the overall staging and design of the scenes is top notch. The characters are very expressive and move quite naturally. You'll even be rewarded with massive battle scenes that evoke some of the coolness of the Lord of the Ring movies.   The final piece of the story's presentation are some really wretched comic panels. The coloring and action is usually pretty good but the overall level of draftsmanship here is very poor. These drawings look like the crappy fantasy strips we used to draw for our high school newspaper. We're not sure if it's a cultural thing, but the characters in this game all speak in what we think of as thought balloons. It's not a big deal but it still seems odd.  The overall art design is acceptable if not exactly clever. Treants, ghouls, giant spiders and the usual suspects of the setting are handled well but don't stand out among others of their kind from similar games. The environments are a bit better and are full of details and touches that make them come alive. Unit animations are solid but the massive press of bodies found in the larger battles makes it impossible to appreciate the work that's gone into the units. If you try to zoom in on the battles, you'll see that the detail on the unit models just isn't good enough to support the action.   We're a little divided on the subject of the voices here. Some of them are quite good and really capture the drama of the moment. Others are more comical. Unfortunately, the voices for the conversations stack up against each other even if you close the dialogue windows. That means you'll be still hearing conversations that have been over for minutes. In the case of the slow-speaking treants, you're likely to hear the conversation five minutes after you've left them behind.  Finally, Heroes of Annihilated Empires is burdened with the loathsome Starforce copy protection. Though CDV has managed to convince most of its developers to do away with the protection software, GSC has unfortunately not seen the value in seeking out other, less obnoxious methods.Heroes of Annihilated Empires is a forgettable experience all the way through. While we really like Elhant's attitude, it's the only thing that stands out as unique in this game. That's a shame because the developers were on to something with the idea of combining modern units with those of the typical medieval fantasy setting. Instead of hitting the ground running with this idea, the developers have decided to hold off. We can only assume that this idea will surface in the inevitable sequel. We're not holding our breath.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
