A Swedish development house, they've carved out quite a name for themselves in Europe with titles like Obsession Pinball and No Fear Downhill Mountain Biking.  Without a doubt, their piece de resistance was Ignition, an overhead view mini-car racer that was released in Europe several years ago, but never made its way across the pond.  But now, thanks to a hastily scribbled deal with Mattel, Yanks have the chance to experience a slightly souped up version of Ignition in its all-new, slimmed down reincarnation as Hot Wheels: Micro Racers.  Can I get a 'hooray' for capitalism?  Sod the storyline, this is a pure arcade racer sans weapons and powerups (besides turbos and super turbos) that needs no introduction.  One singular objective is paramount, specifically the need to reach the finish line ahead of the competition.  To coax more play time out of Micro Racers, the designers insist that you must place first on each of the game's three, yes I repeat only three, tracks (beach, office, bedroom) to advance.  Single races allow newcomers to practice before testing their mettle in championship mode, where the player is given only three opportunities to rank as number one on each track before it's game over, man.  The final play mode, pursuit, is best saved until after you've got a feel for the title's controls, as the car in last place after each lap is permanently destroyed.  Because it's nothing short of scandalous that a paltry three tracks are offered for play, despite the availability of difficulty settings, linear progression is hardly an incentive to keep pushing yourself to the limit.  Nay, my friends, the folks at Mattel and UDS are attempting to bribe us instead with secret cars that can only be accessed by completing championships that pit the player against increasingly tough opponents.  But mastering all of the championship races only grants access to two additional cars, giving you four of the seven total roadsters that can be acquired when the two vehicles that are initially available are taken into account as well.    Surprise, surprise...the missing trio will remain out of your grasp until three 'secret places' have been discovered on each track.  The irony of it all is that you can always plod through the levels in single race mode, taking your time to search the surroundings for the telltale holes that signify the entrance to a secret place.  So long as you make it a point to stop off and visit all three hidden areas and finish the race, regardless of final placement, you'll be awarded the secret car.  If anyone can think of a more asinine way of hiding bonus options in future titles, feel free to drop us a line and maybe we'll pass them along to UDS for laughs.  And yes, even those under 8 years of age can give it a whirl - surely even they can do better.  Equipped with a few of the hidden cars, you should be able to make short work of the game.  Tracks, designed to look gigantic in relation to your puny Hot Wheels racer, are neither complex nor lengthy.  A modicum of intelligence should serve you well, since all that you'll have to do to bring home the cup is get used to the controls and commit to memory the location of upcoming perils like fans and pitfalls.  The discovery of shortcuts and sections where turbo usage is mandatory certainly helps, and the location of these passages can be discovered easily enough by observing competitors' actions.    It doesn't hurt the player's chances any that the game makes every possible effort to ensure that they stay on the track, through the use of warning signs and subtle nudges towards the proper direction.  Regardless of the laws of physics, as long as you're close enough to a narrow section of track or will be landing in the vicinity of an adjoining piece, the program's engine actually shifts your car's position so that it arrives safely at its destination.  Players smart enough to choose an auto with decent attribute scores (top speed, acceleration, grip, turbo recharge time) can exploit the living daylights out of this feature.  Pretty and shallow, now there's a combination!  Tracks may not provide much in the way of a challenge, but they do feature sand castles, toy blocks, desktop computers, and lots of other detailed scenery purposefully designed to make the eye wander.  And once in a while, that's not a bad thing, since beach balls, model trains, and gusts of wind come flying your way with little to no warning.  Don't expect a technical marvel here; 800 x 600's as high as the resolution goes, but 3D acceleration helps smooth out the textures and give the game a sleek, sexy look.  Somebody catch me, I'm getting woozy.  Let's not jump to conclusions, however; maybe it's just an attack of nausea.  I'd certainly be feeling a bit sick to my stomach if I shelled out 20 bucks for what would be considered less than half of a completed game under normal circumstances.  Hot Wheels: Micro Racers looks sporty and plays like a charm, yet it serves up the same amount of longevity as a 'desktop diversion.'  Nice try, Mattel/UDS, but if adults want to snatch fifteen minutes of mindless, unfulfilling play, they're better off passing on Hot Wheels: Micro Racers and picking up Yoda Stori..uh, well..on second thought, the public will stick to Minesweeper instead.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Jun 2, 2000"}
