Some companies seem to think that it's suddenly alright to add a couple of extra things, throw it into a box, ship it out to stores, and have the audacity to charge thirty frickin' dollars for it. Screw that nonsense. Expansion packs like Wacky Worlds for Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 (which I still argue is barely anything but an expansion pack itself), if they have to be released, should not be sold for thirty frickin' dollars. It's ridiculous. The game has not changed in any significant way and has no new gameplay. All of the additions made to the game are purely visual that I could see. So what we have is a game that's still the same as it was at the time of its release four years ago.   All expansion packs seem to have themes, so naturally, a game about theme parks should have one as well. This one, Wacky Worlds, is about the wacky world around us and the wacky things we could do to it if we wanted. Basically, you'll be called on to complete scenarios in different parts of the world, some around famous landmarks, and some just in the area using rules such as environmental laws to keep things centered. For each of these areas, you'll have different themed items that have been specially created for that specific area. Some of the rides, which they're calling new rides, but really should be called new cars, are themed as well. For instance, in Africa, you can have an Ostrich Coaster, which is basically just a stand-up roller coaster with ostrich heads decorating the cars. Yes, it's kind of cute. But no, that is not a new ride when it acts the same as the one it's based off of.   This is the pretty much all of the additions to RCT2 that you'll have to look forward to. Along with the various different cars for the roller coasters, you'll also have a lot of themed props for each area calling on the generic ideas we've all come to know from each part of the world. In China you'll be able to plop down some pandas and pagodas and warrior statues while in Australia you can put add items like giant kangaroo, emu, and Aboriginal items. It's all pretty standard fare for what you would expect to find in these areas.   All of this stuff serves little purpose but to add more decoration into the mix so that hardcore players can deck out their parks with a little more character and variety. Which is funny because you can't actually use these themes in any of the other scenarios. I guess this makes some sense for consistency's sake, but I don't see the harm in allowing different themes to be researched. As it is, you can make it possible, you just have to get into the scenario editor (which still isn't easy to use by the way) and load up one of the pre-made scenarios and change some of the rules. You can then load it back up and add some international flavor to it if you like.   And as before, the engine still looks like it's four years old. The best looking things in the game are the flags that wave in the wind. All else looks like it could have been created with Turtle when compared to the games that are coming out nowadays. Victoria Falls, one of the most beautiful and amazing places on the Earth, is reduced to blue and white pixels moving down a wall. This game actually seems to be getting uglier somehow.    The new scenarios themselves are all set on the seven continents of the world. You'll visit places like Rio, Victoria Falls, the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canyon, and more. Each of these scenarios will be tailored to the area with its purpose. In Australia, the Aborigines apparently need some cultural awareness... so it's up to you to build a theme park about it, complete with those giant kangaroo statues they love so well. At the Great Wall, you won't be able to change the landscape around there at all, so you'll have to plan a bit more and probably have quite a few more rides on stilts. Never mind the blight on the landscape a few gigantic roller coasters crossing the wall are going to create.   Yet none of these scenarios have any specific parameters for success that have anything to do with the parts of the map really. Make money here, get this many people in there, make sure the park is a rating of this much... there's nothing new. Take that Australian Aboriginal scenario. There's no victory conditions that have you creating a park that actually has any of the Aboriginal pieces of scenery to create the cultural awareness that the scenario description talks about. You could create a regular theme park there just as long as you have a certain number of people in the park and don't dip below a specific approval rating. Add some gameplay here. Make it so that these people have to stop and look at some Aboriginal scenery for them to be aware. Do something interesting for crying out loud!Just think, all of this for just one amazing high price! I'm going to have to go ahead and call shenanigans on Atari for this one. Crookery these days seems to be running more and more rampant with these expansions and it's really starting to piss me off. If you're going to charge that much for a game, it better actually add something significant to the experience. But even in the case of a price ten dollars cheaper, I would still have a hard time recommending this to casual fans. The only folks that are really going to want the stuff added in this pack are the hardcore fans that design scenarios and make their theme parks ~just so~. All others should consider themselves forewarned.", "date": "May 30, 2003"}
