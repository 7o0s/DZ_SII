It had a lot of things that many of us RTS fans had wanted to see over the years, but that no one had ever really done well. So now SSG, the gurus behind the Warlords series, is back with more real-time strategy fun with the sequel to their first real-time outing. I'll come in quick by saying that I still enjoy the title and have been having a load of fun with it. Then I'll follow that up by saying it isn't a whole lot different than the first. Then just to confuse you all, I'll say that it did manage to fix a bunch of issues that I had with the original. I guess you could say that the game almost... almost feels more like an expansion than a totally new game. Fans of the first game might not care too much, but those looking for a totally new experience will have to look elsewhere. And here we go again with the pushing and the pulling, I'll still stick my stamp of approval on it for quite a few reasons, even if several of them are the same reasons I stuck the stamp on the first one as well.   Rambling on... the first major difference that you'll notice to this version of the game is probably the biggest change and one that may make or break the game for some of you. While much of the game remains the same or adds more, the campaign portion of the game has undergone a complete overhaul. Say good-bye to the story. It's gone. In its place is a mode that will appeal to those that like to see their forces spread across the globe like a plague to all that would oppose you. The campaign now is a divide and conquer theme with only your own imagination to fill in the story. While some may be a little disappointed for the lack of story, I have to say that I really enjoyed this new campaign mode.   When entering a campaign, you'll be presented with an overland map of Etheria. You'll see that this map is divided into a lot of territories. You're job will be to claim all of these counties in the name of your people. Each race is represented by a city on the map and a different color. Each time a territory is taken by a race, a flag of their color will be placed upon it and each territory that is available for you to invade will be marked with sparklies.   You'll begin the campaign with only your own territory with your home city. From there, you must start expanding and building your empire. Each of the territories has a value associated with it, so choosing where you want to invade will be part of the strategy. These values can include things such as bonuses to combat ratings, conversion times, ranged attacks, sight radiuses... the whole gambit really. If there's a value for it in the game, chances are there's a territory that will improve it a bit. Invade that territory and win the battle to claim your prize. You can even gain control of other races if you capture their home territory. All of these incentives are a really great idea to keep you going and gives you the sense that you're accomplishing a little bit more than just taking a piece of land. It also ads to the intensity of it all as you try to take land away from the computer before it can grab too many bonuses. Each of the territories can be right clicked on to find out what you'll be getting when you invade as well as who owns the territory if anyone and what kind of native race is on the map. More often than not, you'll be playing against several enemies.   Each of the actual battle maps that you duke it out against the computer on will coincide with its territory on the overland map. So if you see a forested territory on the map, you'll be fighting in the forest. Invade a territory that holds a network of islands and you can be assured of fighting across bridges. It isn't hugely important but certainly ads to the continuity and belief that you really are fighting across the world.   The reward for your toils to overthrow all of Etheria is a special and powerful item for your hero to use. Each of these orbs is extremely useful, but depending on the difficulty setting you used for the campaign, you'll get more powerful versions of the item. Taking this into a multiplayer battle will not only serve as a trophy that you were good enough to beat the game, but will also help you with bump over your foe.   Joining the fray for control of Etheria this time around are new playable races including the Dark Dwarves, Daemons, and Fey. As with the other races, each of these has their advantages, disadvantages, and special units. Each of the races are balanced out nicely as a whole with different ways of increasing production, bonuses in certain types of weather and certain times of day (making spells that change these things really nifty), different ways of healing if at all... it all just seems to balance out nicely without you even really noticing.     Considering how many different units and races there actually are in this game, SSG has once again done a pretty good job balancing the units out. That isn't to say they did a perfect job. As it was in the first game, lesser units become almost completely obsolete before games even start when playing against the computer. They're just a little too weak to be of any use aside from cannon fodder. And some of the more powerful units in the game such as your generals seem a little too easy to come by. Units like the dryad on the Wood Elves side are so fast and so powerful that they can mow down entire groups without ever really having to worry about the consequences.   While there were several new units introduced into Battlecry II, the Titans are by far the coolest. They're huge, they're powerful and, if supported by even a handful of regular units, can do a ton of damage to the enemy. The problem is, you really don't see them enough. In the many battles I've played so far, I've probably seen the Titan units come out twice. They're just too expensive and too slow to produce. If you have the money to buy them, it's fun, but I've found by the time you have the time and the wherewithal to make one, you probably already have an army that can take the enemy out without much problem. And every time I started to build a Titan, I had managed to clear the entire map before it was finished producing.    Of course one of the high points of the original was the ability to take your hero unit and bring him or her with your through the campaign and then into the skirmish and multiplayer modes. You can rest assured that your hero is just as important as it ever was. And with more specialties and spells than there used to be, it's just better. You still bring your hero through the game and increase in experience to get new skills, spells, and leadership abilities. This option makes the game that much more personal and that much more fun. And when you add the ability to take a retinue of experienced units with you into the next battle, you've got the surefire recipe for feeling attached to your characters even without a story.   When it comes to the gameplay mechanics, things are a bit better, but still have a little ways to go. AI is certainly better than it was in the original, but still has a propensity to run one unit at a time into your waiting line of defense for half the game. They are a little more organized about sending parties of units out to take resources, but even though there are now formations for use in the game, the computer doesn't really seem to have found that out quite yet. Even if they were used just to keep all of their units together instead of running in a straight line half the time... It's a little sad to see this wasn't better implemented, but luckily the problem wasn't big enough to ruin my enjoyment of the game.   Those who played the original will also be happy to know that most of the super cool features from the original are still at play here such as the psychological effects on troops such as fear and awe that will affect the way your troops behave in a battle. Seeing some of your units run away when a dragon flies their way is pretty disheartening. Hopefully, you'll have pumped your hero's leadership ability up a bit to balance all of that out.   Finally, the graphics have been improved a bit. All of the textures are much crisper and cleaner than they used to be, even if many of the units seem to look the same. The terrain, trees, and buildings especially are much improved. The water and some of the special effects, however, still leave a lot to be desired. I'm a little ticked that they didn't fix the problem of units getting lost behind trees and buildings. They really need to add some shadows or outlines of the units in these cases like they did in Age of Empires or Battle Realms so that you know exactly what's going on.   So my recommendation is this... take a moment to consider what you thought of the first game. Then improve everything that you though could use some work a little bit. Not a lot a bit, but a little bit. Throw in crispier and more colorful graphics and the same decent sound and you've got your game. It's garunteed to give you plenty of gameplay hours and fun. Those RTS fans that haven't played Battlecry yet should certainly think about giving this one a look. If you're one of those junkies that didn't manage to make it into the beta of WarCraft III, then this is certainly a fun way to pass the time.  I've been playing too many damn RTSs since I've started working here at IGN. Thankfully, some of these manage to do some new things and keep my interest. Warlords: Battlecry was one of them. The sequel may not have a ton of really noticeable new things when it comes down to the real-time strategy aspect of play, but it definitely had enough to draw me through my jaded curtain and get me playing and interested again. And that's no longer an easy feat for an RTS.", "date": "Mar 12, 2002"}
