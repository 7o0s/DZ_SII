{"name": "Street Racing Syndicate", "name_review": "SRS: Street Racing Syndicate", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/07/srs-street-racing-syndicate", "text": "A Button - accelerate. B Button - brake. Select Button - have sex. SRS claims to be a racing game, but that's all just a cover. It's really about the women. There are 18 different digital dames to tame - you can pick one to claim when your name earns enough fame. Winning street races and checkpoint challenges is how you'll boost your respect level and secure the company of these ladies, who are then stored back at your warehouse.   Women are just another win condition in SRS, treated like objects and a way to advance your rep. Way to go, Namco - other games make players hide in the shadows to score with ladies of questionable character. Yours comes right out with instructional text: ~Press Select to Hook Up.~ Reinforcement of negative stereotypes and moral outrage aside, SRS is home to a 3D graphics engine and an actual game as well. It's a portal to the world of illegal street racing, where you live your life a quarter mile at a time.    Street Mode puts you in the role of substitute driver. Your crew's main man on the wheel has just been busted, and the big L.A. race is coming up. It's up to you to take his place, compete in his ride, and claim what money and respect you can in just three laps. After the initial event, the game opens up - you use your starting stack of cash to buy your own car, trick it out as you see fit, then browse a map of the city for more racing opportunities. Reaching the finish line faster than the other chumps will earn you more money, more respect, and open more racing opportunities. Then you'll race in those to earn more money, more respect  you get the idea.   An obstacle to your progress comes in the form of being sensitive. Not you being sensitive - you keep 18 girls locked in a garage with your extra car parts, you jerk - your car. The steering control takes a lot of getting used to. You'll be bashing into walls and fishtailing back and forth through your first several races trying to get the hang of it, and you never get completely adjusted.   Another encumbrance is optical obstruction. SRS runs the Blue Roses 3D engine for GBA, but the developers may have tried too hard this time. The graphics are solid in still shots, but the framerate chops along somewhere in the single digits per second. On top of that are clipping issues - it's not uncommon for a rival racer to appear through a solid wall, or for the tracks' blue direction-guiding arrows to show up where they shouldn't, causing you to crash when you follow their path.   Both the handling and visual issues are improved with a camera change. The game offers out-of-car views standard, but pressing Select in a race will swap the view to inside. (It's only the sex button when you're not racing.) With the viewing angle so adjusted, the framerate improves a great deal. It's easier to judge the turns this way, too. It's probably the first time I've ever played a game where an alternate viewpoint makes things both more playable technically and more fun.     If you want your action faster, Arcade Mode is on offer. There you'll find Quick Race, for one-shot sessions; Checkpoint, for time-extension racing; Iron Man, where you race through an increasingly difficult series of courses and your car's damage rating is carried over each time; and Speed Trial - you against the clock. Finally, you'll find multiplayer link cable support, but each player will need their own copy of the cartridge to compete.  If youre having trouble finding a date, SRS may be right for you. Picking up chicks is as easy as pressing a button. It doesn't hit the mark quite as well outside of being a dating simulator, though. Seeing 3D on the GBA isn't as impressive as it used to be, and its been done better in the past  so unless you're lost and lonely for love, youre better off living life out of this particular fast lane.", "date": "Sep 7, 2006"}
