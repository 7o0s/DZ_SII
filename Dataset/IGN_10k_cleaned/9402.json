Say what you will about the quality of the series, but it's been going for a whopping eight years. They even tried to end the show, but fan demand brought the Eds back. Currently on hiatus for a supposed movie, the Eds are probably not the hottest commodity on the market. D3 Publisher managed to snag up the rights and Art Co has developed a Nintendo DS exclusive game, Ed, Edd 'n Eddy: Scam of the Century. Unfortunately the game is a wolf in Ed's clothing and even the biggest fans of the series are better off watching the reruns.   Scam of the Century follows the Eds as they flee from the kids of the Cul-de-Sac after Eddy's scam book is discovered. Everyone is out for their blood, so the Ed's split up, a move that pretty much contradicts the entire nature of the show. Seeing them separate is a rare event, but in Scam of the Century each Ed is all by his lonesome.   The style of the show has been captured remarkably well for the game. During gameplay the character is displayed on the touch screen in the squiggle-vision style the show is known for. The characters on the top screen are presented in a paper doll style. It gives them that loose, floppy feel that everyone in the show has. Signature things, like the way the Eds run, are captured in the game perfectly. Even the writing retains the show's wackiness, and each character is really brought out in the dialogue, including the other cul-de-sac kids.   Unfortunately, the gameplay is about as bad as Ed's breath. Scam of the Century is such a bad platformer title that it's nearly unplayable. Each Ed has four levels to work through before the finale, and each level has a different theme. The first level, being part tutorial, is an unimaginative platformer. It's a Point A to Point B kind of deal. Because all three characters have this type of level, almost a quarter of the game is spent learning how to jump, then walking through a boring level. It's Ed, Edd 'n Eddy! We aren't asking for brilliance, but jumping on a chicken and crossing bottomless pits (in the middle of a suburb?) is so lame that it seems like the developers didn't even try to make a fun game.   The game retains all the classiness of the show. When Scam of the Century isn't being boring, it's being frustratingly, painfully difficult. Some levels have large chunks devoted to jumping from platform to platform over bottomless pits. The problem is the amount of enemies on the screen make this task about as simple as trying to get through a laser security grid. Each enemy not only hurts the character, but knocks them back and makes them stop jumping, usually resulting in his immediate death. The birds don't even move until the character is already jumping, so we kept getting screwed because they would decide to fly right into our path at the last second. It takes an inordinate amount of patience to get through these levels, a level of patience not befitting a game about, and aimed at, hyperactive 12-year-olds.   But patience is not the name of the game, so ironically the very levels that require concentration and time to complete have some sort of enemy dropping crap from the sky or popping out of the ground, forcing us to keep moving. It's so bad, that if we weren't reviewing this game we would have turned it off and thrown it away after 10 minutes. There's almost no motivation because as soon as we pass some poorly designed level, the next one springs up to further attempt to chip away at our insanity.   The only reason to keep trudging along with the game would be to collect enough quarters to unlock minigames. But oh wait, there are only three minigames: three terrible minigames that are poorly designed to the point of practically playing themselves. Whack-A-Zit tries to mimic the classic whack-a-mole game with Ed's back zits. The touch screen only has to recognize the stylus touching a zit, not an actual tap, so the game becomes a scribble fest. The meat puzzle is so simple that making just one move results in some eight move combo. Why should we play when the game obviously wants to just do it for us?   As if to taunt us further, the game has a variety of song that all manage to suck. Each character and different levels have songs, and somehow they are all obnoxious and repetitive. They're vaguely reminiscent of the show's music, but it sounds like the developers didn't get the rights to the music so they just made poor ripoff music. Plus there is no voicework, so as good as the writing is, we don't get to hear it acted out. There isn't even a generic ~ouch!~ when the characters get hurt.  This game is a trap. If we didn't know better we would think it was one of Eddy's scams. It looks like it could be cool, with the squiggle vision and the interesting character design, but then the game forces the player to endure trials and tribulations that make us want to tear our hair out. The minigames are a joke, and even what should be a short game is only stretched out because it takes so long to do one freaking level. Scam of the Century would work well as a punishment for some poor Ed-fan child's circle of Hell. They think they're getting a game based on their favorite show, and then they get killed by birds, over and over and over.", "date": "Nov 1, 2007"}
