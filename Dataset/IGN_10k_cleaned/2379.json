Americans have seen our caped crusader in various forms, changing his attitude and style to fit the times.  Whether it was the cheesy but entertaining tongue-in-cheek humor of the original Batman TV series in the 60's to a darker, moodier Dark Knight in the 80's, Batman has covered almost every facet of media - comic books, television series, cartoons, movies and, more recently, video games.  In this new video game arena, Batman has had his ups (from the Sega CD Batman Returns and the awesome Adventures of Batman and Robin on Genesis) and downs (both Batman And Robin and Batman Beyond on the PlayStation).  Obviously, the most recent video game creations of the Batman have been pretty awful.  So, when the announcement came of a new Batman game, based off the stylish Batman cartoon series, Batman: The Animated Series (later renamed The Adventures of Batman & Robin), we hoped that it the game would be at least slightly better than the Batman video game horrors in recent memory.  Batman Vengeance isn't the perfect Batman game - it's a bit too short, has some control issues, and is rather limited as a game - but it a good blend of solid gameplay mechanics mixed with a good representation of our caped crusader.  As many of you may know, Batman Vengeance follows the storyline and style of the new Batman animated series.  While far from being extravagant in animation, the cartoon series was given a very retro, almost Dick Tracy-like character style; incorporating good storylines, a darker atmosphere, and top-notch voice acting, this new animated series has had wide appreciation.  Batman Vengeance essentially takes this universe and authentically ports it into the Xbox.  The results are excellent - the dark, gothic atmospheric feel, good quality music and sound effects, and all the character of the animated series are well-represented in Batman Vengeance.  The game begins with a pretty neat cinematic sequence (with credits rolling and all) of Batman rescuing a lady from the explosive death trap of the Joker.  This leads into a bigger criminal scheme where you eventually have to confront some of Batman's most famous adversaries from the animated series including Dr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, and of course, the Joker himself.  For the most part, action takes place in the third person perspective but you also have the ability to go into first person mode.  In fact, that's how you're able to use most of Batman's wonderful toys; batarangs, batgrappling hook, and the batlauncher are just some of the many weapons Batman has in his possession.  All of these toys are activated and use in first person mode; by pressing the R Trigger, you go into the first person mode. This enables you to get precise shots when aiming you weapons.  Of course, it's not always about incapacitating criminals from afar - as a master of several martial arts, Batman has numerous punch and kick techniques to knockout thugs.  Mix into the standard punches and kicks are power moves that are earned by handcuffing criminals or by performing certain ~hero-like~ actions in each level.  Beyond the fighting action, there's a heavy dose of adventure aspects; jumping sequences, sneaking through levels, and the use, albeit limited, of Batman vehicles like the Batplane and Batmobile.  Sounds pretty dandy, yes?  With the incorporation of third person and first person perspectives, it sounds like a Batman game with some heavy Metal Gear Solid 2 influences, no?  Well, let's not jump quite there yet as Batman Vengeance is a little clunkier on the controls than MGS2.  First off, to use any of Batman's arsenal of weapons, (well, except the Batcuffs) you have to be in first person mode.  I can understand why you would want to go into first person mode for a more accurate shot but none of these weapons cannot be used in third person mode.   I thought it would be pretty cool to use the batarangs in conjunction with your punch and kick techniques and while you can do this - by switching to first person mode, throwing a batarang, and switching back to third person mode - it's not exactly fluid.  There's also a little annoying hitch that Batman demonstrates when going from a standing position to walking; if you try to get Batman to run from a standing position, he'll pause for a brief second in his walking animation then start bursting into a running stride.  It's slightly annoying especially if you want to escape from a bad situation quickly.  Finally, this game is pretty straight forward; with exception to a few extra things you can do while you progressing through a mission (like thawing frozen guards during the Dr. Freeze stages), your objectives are very simple and there's not a whole lot to explore in each of the levels.  For example, although you're armed with the Batgrappling device, you can only grapple specific targets.  Apart from beating up punks and bosses, the game is a fairly simple in that to complete each level, you just have to get from point A to point B and you don't get much freedom when going through it.   But nonetheless, you're given the well-known Batman weapons that all serve their uses and a fun fighting engine to complement the stylish visuals. Batman Vengeance looks decent on the Xbox though it's hard to really nit-pick on the looks of the game because of the art style.  Like the animated series, the backgrounds are rather simplistic though there are sharp details giving a very ~comic book~ look.  With its simple textures and dark colors throughout each level, this makes room for a smooth frame rate and X-heads will be relieved to know Batman Vengeance runs at a smooth 60 fps frame rate.  In that respect, the game stays true to the overall look of the animated series and that's easily seen in the character models.  You'll instantly recognize all the infamous villains of Batman and they're personas shine through in many of the CG cutsequences.  It's not the prettiest looking game on the Xbox by far - especially those ~flame~ effects - but it keeps to the theme of the series and for the most part, the graphics are solid overall. Batman Vengeance doesn't break any new ground on the Xbox nor doesn't try anything new.  It's a good game that truly engrosses the player into the role of Batman while demonstrating simple, but well-designed gameplay mechanics.  Though there's little to explore in this game and the length is a bit short (eight hours to finish), Batman Vengeance is a solid effort that fans of both action games and of the Dark Knight needn't wait for the signal to get.  --Anthony Chau, IGN", "date": "Dec 12, 2001"}
