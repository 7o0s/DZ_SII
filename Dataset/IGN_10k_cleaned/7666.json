Unfortunately for fans awaiting its appearance in higher resolutions, the game isn't quite what it once was -- running into a couple of technical problems that hurt it to the point of becoming a shell of its former self.   But before we go any further, keep in mind that this examination is stringently focused primarily on the new features that have been added to Devil May Cry 3 in the ten months following its release and the differences in the PC version. Having reviewed the original DMC3 last year (click that link to check it out), I find it a bit repetitive to cover most of the game's aspects all over again. If you're looking for an in-depth analysis of the gameplay system, the atmosphere, and how it all ties together, then by all means head on over to the article posted last February. If you like your summations quick and dirty, however, know this: Devil May Cry 3 is still a fast, challenging, okay-looking game that kicks serious demon ass with multiple fighting styles, gun types, and pointy things... or at least it did on the PlayStation 2. On the PC, it has been bitch-slapped into less.   Dante's back yet again, but this time he isn't the only star. Before we get to its issues, though, let's handle business and talk about the basics. The first of which is the star of this special edition, Dante's ~bad guy~ twin brother Vergil (Don't worry, you can still play as Dante too). What's cool about this new character focus is that Vergil isn't just some palette swap of Dante with an extra animation or two -- he's a completely unique character that plays entirely different from his brother. The downside is that Vergil is only limited to one combat style throughout the entire game (Dark Slayer) as opposed to Dante's five. But if you don't mind using a smaller set of maneuvers and attacks, this one-style restriction doesn't matter at all. The reason? Vergil is so powerful that he can wipe out a wave of enemies that took Dante a few minutes to overcome in just seconds.   In a way, Vergil's extreme power is another drawback. As cool as it is to totally annihilate anything that gets in your way, a lot of what made Devil May Cry 3 work was its extreme challenge and need to figure out what fighting style would work best for what stage. When playing as Vergil, however, those factors become a non-issue and the excitement of being caught up in a potentially dangerous demon-drubbing isn't nearly as great. Then again, there is a great satisfaction in being a walking, talking, rip-ass god of destruction, so Vergil's added power has its advantages too.   Vergil will mess you up... and mess you up bad. While we're on the subject of challenges, DMC3 SE also adds an all-new difficulty setting known as ~Very Hard Mode.~ As if the game wasn't tough enough before, the developers got together and decided that making your thumbs bleed with endless reflex tests wasn't enough. Apparently, it was also a good idea to bring about acute arthritic attacks about 50-years too early... or at least, that's what the back of the box would have you believe. In all actuality, DMC3 is surprisingly easier than it was before. This is because the advertised ~Very Hard~ Mode is just the renamed Hard Mode that had previously been exclusive to U.S. versions of the game -- while Normal is now the equivalent of the last game's Easy setting. Surprising, but true.   One of the better new additions to the console version of Devil May Cry 3 was the reinstitution of the Japanese save system. In last year's version, you could only have as many checkpoints as you had Yellow Orbs (thus adding another layer of difficulty to an already-difficult game). The Japanese edition, on the other hand, used a Ninja Gaiden-type save system where you had as many checkpoints as needed. The latter is a much easier system to employ luckily, but it may still go against the ~save anywhere~ mentality that most PC gamers have. It's weird that Ubi didn't employ some kind of fix out of the box to address this.    Anyway, if a whole extra character and the readjusted balancing isn't enough for you, Dante's Awakening SE also adds a number of other cool little tweaks and features. The brand new ~Demo Digest,~ for example, allows users to replay all the cutscenes they've unlocked throughout their adventure (be they Dante's or Vergil's), while the neat ~Bloody Palace~ mode allows masochists to throw themselves into an almost ten thousand-level dungeon against a barrage of hungry enemies. Capcom has even instituted a ~Turbo Mode~ that ups gameplay speed by roughly 20%. Honestly, the difference between turbo and normal game speed didn't seem very obvious, but hey... at least it's in there. There are a couple of other little goodies worth mentioning as well, but those are better left for you to discover along the way.   So, with all these extras piled on top of an already-excellent game, what could possibly be wrong with it? Sadly there are a couple of hitches (both old and new) that, while not the end of the world, does take away from the experience. For one, the nagging camera control problem that pops up in narrow corridors still hasn't been fixed. The need to frequently backtrack hasn't been adjusted at all either, and the difficulty level may still be a little frustrating for some despite its easier tone. But those were the problems in the PS2 version... they get much less forgivable when moving to windows....   It goes without saying that Vergil is a very bluish-purple kinda guy. And that's because Devil May Cry 3's biggest enemy is the shoddiness of its PC port. The game's visuals, for example, move at a framerate much, much slower than the console version at the lowest resolution on even the most powerful of systems (you're going to want a monster rig with the latest drivers in order to run it semi-smoothly in a display above its native 640). Given its fast-paced nature and emphasis on action, the choppy movement and slow-as-molasses animations of the enemies take away from a lot of what makes the experience tick... and while it's still fun, it's noticeably less so. High-end textures haven't been added either, which leaves the game looking like a two-year old PS2 game (because it is), while the in-game cinematics are of a low quality because of bad video compression.   The worst example of haphazard porting, though, belongs to the game's controls... they're awful! On PlayStation 2, they were near flawless -- easy to learn and easy to access. On PC, however, the default keyboard setup is pure craziness (Escape is the de facto ~select~ button, which makes no sense whatsoever). Furthermore, Devil May Cry 3's joystick support is terrible. You can't remap the analog sticks on the customization screen regardless of your controller, and none of the gamepads we tried worked correctly with it (The Xbox 360 controller swaps stick commands so that the left stick controls the camera and the right stick controls movement -- ouch!). In an action game like this where a mastery of the controls and the hectic pace is what drives you forward, the PC version's technical shortcomings drastically change its quality. For fans (like me), it's akin to being punched in the face.The first version of Devil May Cry 3 was one of the best PlayStation 2 games of 2005 and its budget re-release was even better. But as great an upgrade as it was for console owners, its awful performance on even the most juiced of machines and craptacular controls do it terrible, terrible harm. Don't get me wrong, there's a great game in there just waiting to get out, but its abundance of port problems make it difficult to find.", "date": "Nov 23, 2006"}
