Sort of a    Warhawk by sea, N-Space's game puts you    at the controls of the Tigershark subfoil, a    boat/sub hybrid that's just as lithe on water    as it is underneath.      Set in the future, Tigershark pits you    against the entire Russian army above the    now-sunken remains of Japan. Haywire    geothermal tests have set off massive    earthquakes, causing the Land of the Rising    Sun to flood. Russia wants it, and it's your    job to stop them, and prevent them from    monkeying around with more tests.     Each of the 10 levels (nine regular plus one    training) assigns you multiple targets, from    radars to large installations, which you    must take out to make it to the next one. To    stop you, Russia has dispatched their finest    subs, battle cruisers, and other ships. Most    of your targets are underwater, but you'll    have to surface to fight off your attacking    opponents, who have the uncanny ability of    being able to shoot at you from the surface.    Subs and other small ships will also come    at you from under the water.     While the graphics may not be the best the    PlayStation has ever seen, they're pretty    solid and get the job done. The    boats are especially cool, and the subs are    just awesome. However, there is an    abundance of foggy pop-up on the surface    landscapes.     If you're a fan of Warhawk or other,    mission-based shooters, you'll definitely    want to give Tigershark a look-see.", "date": "Sep 5, 1997"}
