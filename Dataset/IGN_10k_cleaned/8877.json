It's understandable that DChoc finally decided it wanted a piece of that action, but instead of just rolling out a series of self-branded games like Gameloft's Platinum label, the developer conjured an entire ecosystem for its games to live within. The umbrella is called Cafe, a coffee shop-themed destination that will one day house an entire suite of casual games, but launched this week with three definite moneymakers: solitaire, sudoku, and kakuro.   Simply put, Cafe is genius.   The branding alone is a success, as it instills a sense of comfort whenever you see it on the deck. Did you like the way Cafe Solitaire played? Well, then chances are you'll have an equally good time with Cafe Kakuro. Or Poker. Or whichever other games Digital Chocolate launches in the future. It's the same formula that has served Gameloft exceedingly well with both their Platinum and Midnight brands, as well as JAMDAT prior to the EA Mobile acquisition.   But the construction of the Cafe ecosystem is the real silver bullet. When you buy your first Cafe game, you create your very own online destination that lives on a DChoc server. This cafe is small and has only a one-star rating. You also create an avatar that lives in the cafe. As you play, you earn new clothes for your avatar -- this is hardly an original concept, but still an effective one -- as well as trophies, which also occupy a special section of the virtual coffee shop. Your cafe is part of an overall network of cafes that encourages you to invite friends as well as ~compete~ with other cafes. The more friends that join your cafe and participate, such as pooling points earned by playing the games or winning game-specific trophies, the higher your ranking and the better it looks.   I logged in this morning to discover my tiny, quaint one-star rated starter cafe was suddenly a two-tier coffee house with a three-star rating because two friends had joined in, played games, and participated in activities such as exchanging greetings with my avatar. That, dear reader, is very cool and surprisingly addictive, not entirely unlike waiting to earn achievements to boost your Xbox 360 gamerscore. The visual punch of logging in and seeing that a friend has bumped up your cafe cannot be underestimated.   As mentioned, this cafe hub is universal, so no matter which Cafe game you download (you can pick and choose -- you are not required to buy every single Cafe game, nor are the friends you invite to your cafe), you always have the same home screen, which instills a healthy amount of loyalty. Why buy another solitaire game when buying Cafe Solitaire will help you add cool stuff to your personal cafe?   Cafe doesn't hold you ransom, either -- you keep whatever points and trophies you earn for your cafe even if you let a subscription to one of your games expire. Because the Cafe lives on the network, you can even let all of your Cafe games expire and not be penalized. As soon as you buy a new one down the road, you can log right back into the cafe you previously created and have all of your points and trophies waiting for you.   The three launch games need no real introduction, only the assurance that these are easily amongst the best versions of solitaire, sudoku, and kakuro you have played on mobile. Solitaire comes complete with 13 variations and an intelligent cursor system that makes manipulating the cards very easy and intuitive. Sudoku has endless replay value. Kakuro, my favorite among the three, is also one of those evergreen games that never gets old due to the limitless supply of puzzles.   In Sudoku and Kakuro, you earn more points for your cafe by playing tougher puzzles. This encourages you to challenge yourself, not just for personal satisfaction, but for the benefit of your cafe.   Check out the screens I have for the Cafe games and the actual cafe hub to get a feel for the overall theme. The coffee shop decor is incredibly inviting -- it really does look like any number of comfy coffee houses you'll find in a cosmopolitan city. Every game subscribed to the theme, using a wood table background and various items around the border, such as a pen, coffee mug, or watch. Good stuff.  After you play Cafe, there is no going back to a basic, standalone edition of an evergreen classic game like solitaire or sudoku. Why would you bother when this suite offers you a wonderful, dynamic community that smartly encourages participation? Using the same unique sensibility that has served them well with their awesome original games like Tornado Mania, Digital Chocolate has completely reinvented the way you should look at classic games on mobile. I certainly have.", "date": "Aug 10, 2007"}
