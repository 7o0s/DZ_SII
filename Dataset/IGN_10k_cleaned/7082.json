Unfortunately for shooter fans, there's little new awaiting them in this one. The Unreal influences are obvious, but the title shies away from pushing the aging shooter formula forward. Instead, the game focuses largely on fast, close-range combat with 6 upgradeable weapons. While it doesn't do anything new, it's still a solid game devoid of any glaring issues.  Even if you're a rabid shooter fan, however, you may find yourself growing weary with WarPath.   With such a heavy leaning on multiplayer, the game does offer a single player mode. Choosing one of three factions, The Ohm, The House of Kovos, or The Coalition, players are able to choose battles from a triangular level selector. Each faction starts out at a different angle of the triangle, and is given two of the six guns to use. Unlocking the others requires players to battle across the map and conquer the two enemy factions' territory. Though each faction has their own back history, none of this really plays into the fighting. It's basically mindless arena battles in deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, or front line assault modes.    The only mode really unique to WarPath is front line assault, though it's more like a severely stripped down version of UT2004's onslaught mode. In it, players are challenged to capture a series of nodes scattered around the level. After a node's capture, a timer begins which, when expired, registers the node as your own. Then it's time to move on to the next one. Once all the nodes on a stage belong to one team, the base becomes vulnerable. Destroying an enemy base scores a point. The challenge of the mode is to protect a node while the timer's counting. Any time the enemy manages to pass through it, it becomes theirs. Therefore, teams must work together to fend off attackers until the timer finishes.   Fighting alongside in the single player battles are bots. To get any kind of challenge, players will want to drop ~flatlined~ bots, the highest difficulty rating, into the game. Otherwise none of the single player missions or bot battles set up online are much of a challenge. During play we found any bots at the medium difficulty setting, ~damage control,~ would perform some questionable maneuvers. This included both teammates and enemies squatting down in a spot for no apparent reason. We assumed they were waiting for an enemy, but it was difficult to tell. In a few of the capture the flag matches we played offline and on, enemy bots would run right by us without shooting. During front line assault matches, enemy bots would sometimes stream toward the capture route on the same line, making blasting them a simple task.    Cranking the difficulty to flatlined seemed to resolve some of these problems. Their accuracy and aggressiveness greatly improved, though some of the strange behavioral patterns seemed to remain. For instance, while playing front line assault mode on Dust, at least six flatlined bots in a row took the exact same route to approach a node. Every time they ran right by us. Taking them out was a simple matter of waiting for them to hit the node, then slicing them across the back with our Vibro Blade. Bots performed generally well in capture the flag mode. One or two always hung back to protect home base, the others roamed the field. However, none of our bots on any difficulty setting managed to capture the enemy flag. They did a great job at preventing the enemy from running away with our flag, but unless escorted by us, never returned to base with the enemy's precious energy fabric. Since the responsibility falls to the player to make the captures, it's too bad the enemy has such an uncanny sense of direction. Becoming the flag carrier must loose sonic booms only audible to the opposition, because many times they swoop in with an urgency akin to vacating work on Friday afternoon. Thankfully there's a sprint function that can help distance players from the opposition.   While fighting bots can get boring fast, players will be glad to know all the guns are available online. Unfortunately, barely anyone is playing this game right now on PC or Xbox, which really huts the title's appeal. Matches can be set up with bots in the hopes someone will join, but the online activity in general is extremely light. In the Xbox version, WarPath lets players check statistics of others online. At last look, there were only five who'd been playing on Xbox Live. That's a problem. Not with the game, but it's certainly something gamers should consider if pondering a purchase.     We actually did manage to hook up with a few to play a couple modes, though most of the server was filled with bots. On PC up to 16 players can be crammed into any of the four modes. On Xbox up to eight can play deathmatch or team deathmatch, while only six can engage in assault or capture the flag. Should you decide to run a dedicated server, the PC limit bumps up to 32 players and the Xbox to 16. Though there are a number of maps, none of them are very big. A few of the front line assault maps include vehicles. The Razorback jeep can accommodate two soldiers. One to steer and blast front mounted machine guns, and one to swivel and fire a rocket battery. Steering each takes a little getting used to. On both Xbox and PC the camera direction controls the steering, but eventually it gets easy enough. However, players will find themselves very rarely hopping into one of these machines since the levels are so small. Even on the largest maps, space is so cramped it barely makes any sense to jump in a vehicle. Also, it's far easier to target enemies with hand weapons than with the vehicles' armaments.   As far as the weapons go, some are definitely more effective than others. Two can be carried into battle at once. With special Combat Augmentation Module (CAM) units that drop from fallen foes, players can upgrade their weapons across three tiers. The Vanguard energy gun is one of the best, since in its upgraded form it fires out a sentry energy orb. Once discharged, the energy blast acts as its own weapon, firing bolts at any nearby enemies. This is ideal for flag or node defense. The other weapons provide a good variety of firepower options. The Judge rocket launcher can acquire up to four targets at once, and the Tyrant grenade launcher fires adhesive remote grenades at its maxed out setting. From what we played, it was best to carry around a Judge and a Vanguard. The Judge instantly kills those it hits, meaning the Wolverine, Tyrant, and Violator aren't worth anything against it.    At close range most of these weapons are rendered ineffective by the Vibro Blade. This weapon can be deployed at any time, slicing across the screen and instantly killing whatever is directly in front of the player. It's not that difficult to pull off, and can be the source of much frustration against opponents online. Also upgradeable is an Emergency Medical Aid Device that bestows more health and faster regeneration. Generally this would be the last item to upgrade, since bumping up weapon power is more crucial to survival.   Graphically, the PC version is far superior. In addition to sharper textures and a greater level of detail, WarPath runs at a respectable framerate. On Xbox, WarPath often chugs online or off, causing aiming complications. The game seems to have particular trouble indoors with a crowd of players and gun effects occurring simultaneously. On both there are some nice lighting effects, and the heat distortions during explosions are particularly eye catching. Other than that, the game looks like any first person shooter fan might expect. Cramped metallic, machine-like corridors are the main architectural feature of any level. Some of the larger maps have a few outdoor areas, but for the most part each map looks very much the same, just with different color schemes. It's also difficult to determine which players are on your team since the character models are very similar. Some kind of indication outside of your reticule turning red when enemies are targeted is needed.    When blasted with explosives, players will find themselves and enemies being catapulted high into the air. The Havok physics used in WarPath are tweaked towards the extreme side. It doesn't hurt the game, but it is funny to watch someone cartwheeling 30 feet off the ground. With regard to sound, WarPath provides little that's memorable. Generic techno pervades each level, and most of the gun effects and explosions are what you'd expect. The Vanguard's orb attack is an exception. Its pulsing orb effect is one of the game's best aural aspects.While WarPath doesn't do anything blatantly wrong, it fails to do anything new. Charging through the repetitive metallic halls of each level will feel very familiar to anyone who's played a lot of first person shooters. Even the bots on the hardest difficult suffer from noticeable A.I. issues, so if this one's to be played at all it should be online. After numerous hours of play some weapon balance issues will become apparent, especially with the Vibro Blade during close range battles. Vehicles are included, but they're generally useless as the stages are so small. A larger variety of game modes more interesting maps would have helped out, but ultimately WarPath does little too differentiate itself from the rest of the shooters out there. The upgradeable weapons are a good feature, but nothing that'll hold players' interest beyond a few hours. If you're absolutely committed to getting this game, the 30 dollar Xbox version is totally not worth it. The 20 dollar PC is the better of the two, especially considering it's free of the Xbox's chop factor.", "date": "Jul 25, 2006"}
