Though Zack, Trini, Kimberly, Jason, and Bill are long gone, as long as the world faces peril from the terrible impending doom of gigantic Japanese monster suits, there is a need for spandex-clad teen sensations to Morph into action. Alpha, sound the call! Features:More than 20 levels, including hidden stagesFive rangers to choose fromBig boss battles featuring giant creatures Password save Only for Game Boy ColorFor those not up on the latest of the Power Rangers' exploits, here's a quick run-down. The teens have grown up some, and have taken a more active role in their home of Mariner Bay (as well they should -- they spend half their time in any given episode destroying huge portions of the town with their gigantic Zords trampling all over the place). Now the Lightspeed Rescue Power Rangers, the new team has redesigned Omegazords that serve as rescue vehicles in real life -- a helicopter, and ambulance, a fire fighter, and so on. When an emergency rises in the city, the Power Rangers are on the job to save the citizens and avert disaster. Of course, these disasters are most often caused by the evil supervillian minions of Diabolico, so once the people are safe, it's time for the Rangers to blast into action, form the Omega Megazord, and vanquish evil! A lot of work for a couple of young kids, but somebody's got to do it.The vast story potential of rescue Rangers has worked well for this newest Power Ranger game, making (for perhaps the first time) an enjoyable Mighty Morphin game (or Saban game in general, for that matter). The teens will have missions to save the people from horrible natural disasters before it's too late. Along the way, they'll have to track down tools and solve traps to get to the trapped workers and civilians. Floods and fires block the path, and elevators are trapped between floors, so the teens will have to work carefully while rushing through the levels looking to save every last man.And yet this is a Power Rangers game, and what would a Power Ranger game be without gigantic monster battles, mega-zord deployment, and infinite skirmishes with Putties... er, Batlings? The Rescue levels are just one of three gaming styles in Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue, and while the other two aren't as successful as the Rescue, little kids will still love the blocky Zord battles and the Monster vs. Ranger fights. It's just fun to fight baddies when you're a superhero (and the control works). About the only thing that's missing (and it's unfortunately dearly missed when I say missing) is a stage that uses the Omegazord vehicles or the Land Crawler Zord form. Fighting stages are laid out too similarly to the Rescue stages, and it would have been great if the kids could have hopped into a car or helicopter to fly around and break up the monotony. Maybe next time.There would be no way of fooling the jaded, one-time Ranger fans now all grown up that this a great game. It's not. It's great big monsters threatening a harbor town with fiery breath and icy toejam, and spandex-clad techno-teens leaping to the rescue. That's all you can expect from the show, and that's all you get in the game. No problem there. If you skip the game, no big loss. However, the Power Ranger fans who do pick it up will be looking for just this kind of silly gaming, with chunky robots and endless battles, and for them, the higher quality of this game over other Power Ranger titles will be a surprise treat. It's a challenging game with sensible gameplay -- no Mario, but better than whole caseloads of bad Game Boy games we own. Add to that exciting cut-scenes done up in the style of the show (we even get to see the Zords coming together to form the Omega Megazord), and you have a big, hoaky, ludicrous, challenging, fun Power Ranger game. And it comes with a poster! It's not quite Morphinomenal, but then again, what is these days?", "date": "Jul 14, 2000"}
