While Electronic Arts polishes its big-budget console version of 007: Everything or Nothing, the company gives GBA owners a treat with the GBA edition independently developed by the same studio as the past two Lord of the Rings games on the handheld. Even with the shorter development cycle, the GBA game ends up a great surprise of a Bond game, combining Metal Gear Solid stealth elements and balls-out action in its extensive adventure. Features Stealth action and driving missions Connectivity with GameCube version Link cable support for four players Cartridge save (three slots) Everything or Nothing is not based on any James Bond film. It's actually a completely original Bond experience made specifically for the videogame environment. But the design team is going for complete Bond authenticity, from using Pierce Brosnan's likeness to hiring a big name actor for the villain (Willem Dafoe) commissioning an original Bond theme song from artist Mya. As of this writing it's too early to say if team's successful in its attempt to recreate the feel of the Broccoli-style Bond flicks, but the Everything or Nothing Bond presentation has definitely trickled into the GBA version, even in a more limited form. The GBA game actually opens up like a Bond movie, with a fast-paced escape sequence to introduce players to the action, gadgets and control scheme. It would have been cooler had this sequence led into a silhouette-style credits sequence instead of jump players into the next mission, but at least the GBA team worked some Bond style into the game design.  Everything or Nothing is segmented into missions that span across what we can assume is the same storyline as the upcoming console version. In these missions, players (as Bond) work through hostile territories performing specific tasks set forth by M. The main gamestyle's set in the familiar isometric, slightly overhead perspective, players maneuvering Bond through the different environments. All the areas are filled with enemy guards patrolling the area, set into alert status by A) gunfire, or B) seeing Bond. Players will have to stay low and out of sight in order to sneak up on these guys, which is not an easy task. The view's a little on the close side and makes the viewable area a little on the tight side, so it's a good thing that the developers added an overhead ~radar~ view and an alert meter in the corner to inform the player when  guards have sensed Bond in the area. The game could use a bit more screen area than what's been given, but it's definitely playable the way it is.  Players can simply play cowboy and blast their way through the missions with the large assortment of guns, bombs, grenades...but Everything or Nothing encourages stealth by rewarding points for removing guards without these guys noticing. These points can then be converted into Bond abilities, enhancing his speed, accuracy, damage, and other attributes. Normal mission objectives also award these points, but to get the upperhand in the later, tougher missions, it's good to take the guards out unseen and earn the extra score.  Between these tactical/action missions are driving sequences that are obviously inspired by (read: completely ripping off) the classic Spy Hunter arcade game. Players zoom the Aston Martin through forced scrolling action sequences, blasting vehicles with machine guns, missiles, and oil slicks. The only real difference between this and Spy Hunter is that these challenges are set in the same angled perspective as the main portions of Everything or Nothing. This angle is a little awkward at first for a driving scenario, but after a few deaths, the controls become second nature.  The overall game engine does a good job with handling the on-screen action, even with all the explosions and carnage going on. The art direction's a little on the exaggerated side; the game features use of the real actors' likenesses, like Brosnan and Judy Denech as M, but they've been heavily painted over...and John Cleese (as Q) doesn't look like himself at all. But where the game really shines is in its audio; the game features brief audio samples from the aforementioned actors (most likely lifted from the upcoming console game), and the music soundtrack is outstanding; its really well-produced music and sets the mood perfectly. Definitely headphones material, and it even supports stereo sound so you can hear which side the enemy spotted Bond. Everything or Nothing for the GBA will even interface with the GameCube version when it ships next year. But for those that can't wait that long, this game also has a few extra multiplayer deathmatch modes, as many as four players can join in this link cable support. There's even a Blackjack mini-game hidden in the adventure, but you'll need a ton of those collected style points in order to unlock it. The development team definitely worked to give this Bond game a bit more replay beyond the main adventure. 007: Everything or Nothing is definitely the best Bond on the Game Boy Advance so far; last year's handheld Nightfire first-person shooter was an admirable project, but Everything or Nothing is more tuned to the GBA's strengths and features much more variety in the game and level design. The ~camera~ is a little too close which makes the whole stealth thing a lot more difficult (and somewhat more clumsy) than it could have been, but it's still incredibly fun and enjoyable as it is.  I'm definitely looking forward to playing the console version after experiencing the well-produced GBA rendition, that's for sure.", "date": "Dec 5, 2003"}
