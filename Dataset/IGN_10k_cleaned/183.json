It's a title that took more than two and a half years to complete from start to finish and it shows in the game's beautifully designed 3D environments and delightfully intelligent script. It's a game that features never-ending, non-linear fashioned exploration of Zelda-esque proportions that truly challenges players to think and devise solutions to puzzles. It's a dark, atmospheric, eerie journey that should be played alone, with the volume turned up and with the lights off.The StoryThe game follows the story of Michael LeRoi, a failed-out English major who, in the year 1991, find himself working as a taxi driver in Chicago -- far away from his family in New Orleans. One day while on the job, one of LeRoi's passengers is murdered in a gang-style killing, leaving $20,000 behind in the back of the taxi-cab. With dreams of escaping the city and returning home on the mind, LeRoi decides to take the cash.This decision, of course, leads to a whole series of unfortunate events -- a downward spiral that ultimately sees LeRoi's parents and younger brother murdered by the crime syndicate of which he stole the money from. But his family's demise is only the beginning of LeRoi's problems. In order to protect himself from the same uncaring group that slaughtered his family, the soon-to-be-doomed character enlists the help of a voodoo priest -- another unlucky mistake. LeRoi eventually becomes a slave (and more precisely an assassin) to the priest, unable to control his actions or fully remember his past.One fateful evening, though, LeRoi is kidnapped by an opposing voodoo priestess -- Mamma Nettie -- who forcibly implants the Mask of Shadows into his chest. With the powerful voodoo artifact glowing from within him, LeRoi is made to serve Mamma Nettie in unquestioning obedience. The Mask of Shadows grants LeRoi the power to shift to Shadow Man, a being who can travel to a world beyond the living called Deadside. Here he is the taker of souls, the bringer of death... a demi-god of sorts.After waking from a terrible, prophetic nightmare, Nettie orders LeRoi -- Shadow Man -- to save the world from coming apocalypse. This is where the adventure that is Acclaim's Shadow Man begins.The Facts Third-person action adventure. Single-player. Impressive 3D game engine displays huge worlds without need for fogging. Promised 60+ hours of gameplay. Rated Mature due to violence, gore, profanity, implied sexual situations and psychological scares. More than 40 minutes of cut-scenes and hours of in-game speech. Two giant worlds -- Liveside and Deadside -- and tens of complex sub-areas. Completely non-linear gameplay. 4MB Expansion Pak compatible for high-resolution mode. Rumble and Memory Pak support.The GameShadow Man is a non-linear quest. In the game, players control both Michael LeRoi and Shadow Man depending on location. In Liveside, the world of the living -- our world -- LeRoi remains unchanged, able to pick up a variety of weapons and fight off enemies, but entirely mortal nonetheless. LeRoi can travel to the world of the dead -- Deadside -- using a teddy bear that used to belong to his now deceased younger brother. It is here that he becomes Shadow Man, a voodoo-enhanced super-being who possesses the ability to conquer and absorb the souls of the damned. Additionally, Shadow Man boasts some handy benefits over his Liveside likeness, such as the ability to swim underwater forever without drowning, as well as being able to survive long falls without being hurt. And then, of course, there is the fact that he can execute all sorts of evil voodoo spells -- some more gruesome than others.In a style very similar to Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Shadow Man can go anywhere at any time. There is no set route. However, some gates to every sub-world remain locked until the voodoo warrior has achieved specific goals. One of these goals -- perhaps the most important of which if players are to advance in the game -- is the collection of Dark Souls, the nested souls of evil beings, which reside comfortably in Deadside. There are literally dozens and dozens of these Dark Souls hidden throughout the game, many of which can be very difficult to access at times. The Dark Souls act as keys to many of the gateways that lead to new areas of the adventure. Supposing Shadow Man comes to a gate that requires six Dark Souls to enter and he only has five, players will be denied access until they have found and collected one more Soul. In addition to the collection of Dark Souls, players must find and locate a series of small pots called Cadeaux located throughout the game. There are literally hundreds of these little guys, which are eventually used as an offering to the god Loa, who then grants Shadow Man something in return.Finally, Shadow Man must also solve puzzles, kill tons of enemies and acquire new special abilities in order to advance to new areas. Just as Link required the red tunic to walk in lava areas, Shadow Man requires fire gads -- a physical upgrade that must be found before it can be used. Players will gather other incredible abilities as they make their way further into the adventure, such as the power to climb up bloody waterfalls and to walk on fire. Once these new abilities are acquired, players will rush to previously unattainable parts of the game in order to see what's waiting for them -- and this is how the title works.Frankly, the quest comes together brilliantly. Just as in Zelda, finding new objects and putting them to use in order to advance through the game is extremely rewarding and satisfying. Devising new ways to collect the hidden or seemingly unattainable Dark Souls is equally entertaining. The exploration factor -- a cross between Zelda's go-anywhere and do anything non-linear style and Tomb Raider's jump-and-grab, ledge-strafing design is cleverly executed and well balanced. All of this, mind you, is to say nothing of the game's control. And speaking of which...ControlThe analog stick turns LeRoi in all directions. Pressing forward makes him run and pressing backward makes him backstep. The character does not move with the speed and agility of, say, Mario in Super Mario 64. Rather, LeRoi moves and is manipulated with at a pace and feel that is very reminiscent of Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider franchise, but with some very significant differences. LeRoi is faster. This is perfectly demonstrated by turning the character to the left or right. Unless he is in a wide-open, huge 3D environment, there is no sluggishness to turning. Response is tight, accurate and quicker than that in Tomb Raider. LeRoi strafes faster. Using the C-Down button, he rolls and spins. The camera hovers right behind him during all of these actions. Using the D-Pad, however, the camera can be made to shoot the action from any direction, be it to LeRoi's side, behind him, or right in front of him. It can also be pulled back for a broader view of the environment. The L button, meanwhile, circles the camera system back to its original position behind LeRoi. The R button is used for strafing and targeting -- a feature that was added into the game after its developers saw how well it worked in Zelda 64. Both the B button and Z-Trigger are assigned weapon buttons (though we don't know this yet as LeRoi has no weapons of any kind at this point). Holding C-Down makes LeRoi crouch while C-Up is used for sniping enemies. When the button is pressed, the view switches to first-person and the analog stick is used for aiming a cross-hair in the middle of the screen. Finally, C-Right opens up an inventory screen.Shadow Man is ambidextrous, meaning he can use both his left and right hands. So, it's possible (and important) to arm the dark figure with a gun in each hand at times. Doing this, he can strafe around enemies while shooting off both weapons -- say a shotgun and pistol -- simultaneously. It's also possible to hang from a rope with one hand and fire off a weapon with the other. It's a clever addition to the game that is much more than a marketing point; it works -- and works well.What doesn't always work so great, on the other hand, is the game's Z-Targeting system. It's fairly obvious that the design team at Acclaim Teeside Studios saw Zelda and decided to borrow the strafing feature for its battle system. That's fine by us. It's an excellent addition to any game of this type. The problem in Shadow Man, though, is that once players lock-on to an enemy, there is no guarantee that the lock will stay. In other words, enemies sometimes shake off the lock-on system, leaving players at a disadvantage as they reposition Shadow Man to face his foes again. We should note that this is not a terrible flaw as it usually doesn't happen, but it is a bit bothersome and does sometimes detract from the game experience.The VISTA EngineThe Acclaim Teeside-developed VISTA engine powering Shadow Man is an extremely refreshing departure from many of Acclaim's other game engines. Perhaps VISTA's biggest claim to fame is, ironically, the depth of visibility it allows -- a complete opposite from the limited vision field present in the fog-filled Turok franchise that made Acclaim a household name for Nintendo 64 owners. Like Zelda before it, players can see miles into the distance with very little slowdown (and none at all in the PC version of the game).For your convenience, we've provided you with a video snippet (approximately 1.8MBs in size) demonstrating the power of VISTA. To access it, click on the image below. Note the castle far off into the distance. That is not a background image.With VISTA, there is no need for fogging. No thick haze of nightfall, clouds, smog, ~kryptonic fog~ -- whatever. VISTA is designed to handle these huge polygonal 3D environments flawlessly and, for the most part, it succeeds. We should note that the Nintendo 64 version of the game does fall victim to a bit of slowdown. However, considering the fact that people enjoyed Rare's GoldenEye immensely despite its sometimes smothering framerate issues, we're confident that Shadow Man will be cut the same amount of slack. The game is smooth most of the time, only stuttering slightly in open areas. This is forgivable, as it never interferes with the gameplay experience.Architecture in the PC version of the game is more detailed in than the Nintendo 64 incarnation and some unimportant extras are present. For example, in the tower to Asylum level, a few light posts are present in the PC original that aren't in the Nintendo 64 port. Do you think you'll be able to deal with the loss?High resolution graphics could have easily been left out of Shadow Man because of the sheer depth of the game. It still would be a fine game even if saddled with Mission: Impossible-style blurs and lack of detail. Good thing for all of us that the game not only has a Hi-Res option but it runs just as fast as it does in the lower resolution. Since there's no sacrificing speed for visuals, be sure to run Shadow Man in Hi-Res and get the full effect. The limited amount of slowdown and choppiness we experienced happened in the same parts of the game regardless of the resolution setting.SoundThe cut scenes in Shadow Man really work because of the accompanying sound samples. They're so clear and so natural that you'll be drawn in to the point where you forget to pick up your controller once the game action starts again. The acting talents are top notch and you get all of the subtleties of Nettie's West Indian accent along with Shadow Man's grim intonations. However, when it comes to a great use of sound in a videogame, your first encounter with the serpent gate keeper Jaunty will let you hear just how good it can get on the N64. His Irish accent and sharp wit are so good that you can forget that you're playing a videogame. You'll find yourself actually entertained and listening to this smart-ass snake wearing a big black farmer's hat like he was the best supporting actor in a feature film.The sound effects are equally impressive. When Michael/Shadow Man are walking on wooden bridges you can hear the hollow echo. Start sloshing through the swamp and that's just what you'll hear. Creaking doors only add to the intense spookiness of the game. The howling of the demonic Rottweilers is like nothing you've ever heard but you've got to believe that's what those suckers would sound like if you ever came across one. One sound effect that maybe shouldn't have been so developed is Shadow Man's pistol. The howling soul stealing energy makes a hollow ringing sound that's okay by itself, but when you start letting loose round after round it can become extremely irritating. And you will be blasting plenty of baddies in Shadow Man so you may want to lower the sound effects if it gets to be too much for you.The music of the game is very appropriate and really gets you in the mood for an adventure into the dark side of the human spirit. The main theme works well and could've easily been used in one of those barbarian movies made famous by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The slow intense strings riding over the steady and electricying percussion make for a great combination.", "date": "Aug 25, 1999"}
