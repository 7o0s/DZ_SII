Set in medieval times, War Craft II: The Dark Saga is a realtime strategy game that allows you to strategically battle against clans of either Orcs or Humans.   Suprisingly, War Craft II: The Dark Saga has some changes in the game that should've appeared in the PC version. For example, the unit groups have been expanded to 16, as opposed to its original nine. This means that you can move more units, which results in bigger and badder wars. Of course, the more you move, the more you may lose.  One of the other major changes that impressed us was the customizable production options. Let's pretend you're maintaining two bases.  This option allows you to give production orders to one structure, plus pay closer attention to another base/structure that may be under attack. In essence, this option saves a ton of time.  War Craft II: The Dark Saga has one major flaw: the graphics. Unlike all the great audio tracks and cool missions, the graphics are simply below par when compared to the PC version. Battles tend to get confusing when multiple units come on to the screen. It would've been better to see this PC classic in high-res.  Besides the graphics, War Craft II: The Dark Saga is a strong game and should not be over looked. In fact, this game has to be one of the better PC ports ever to come to the PlayStation.", "date": "Aug 20, 1997"}
