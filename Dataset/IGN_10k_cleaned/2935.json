{"name": "Donkey Kong Jr.", "name_review": "Donkey Kong Jr.-e", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/09/17/donkey-kong-jr-e", "text": "Thanks to the ~power~ of the e-Reader, actual Nintendo Entertainment System games released back in 1986 can now be reissued on super inexpensive trading cards. By scanning in each of the data strips spread across five trading cards, players literally can turn their e-Reader device into an NES cartridge.  Donkey Kong Jr. is the sequel to the immensely popular Donkey Kong arcade game, and the NES version ported the game near exactly for play at home. Players assume the role of Donkey Kong's son, Junior, set out to rescue his pop from Mario the kidnapper. The adventure takes players across four different locations that put Junior's jumping and climbing skills to the test. If Junior grabs onto a single vine, he can climb up slowly or slide down quickly...grabbing two parallel vines will giving him faster climbing abilities, but his descent speed is slowed down. Mario continues to send enemies down the vines...but Junior can take these guys out by plucking fruit out of mid-air and sending it down to nail 'em on the head.  Unlike the NES version of Donkey Kong which only has three out of the four arcade levels in it, Donkey Kong Jr. features all four of the challenges that were introduced in arcades two decades ago. The graphics are simplistic to today's standards, but for the time the game was released, the vibrant imagery was really impressive. On the GBA system, the game looks and sounds exactly as it did on the NES.  On the e-Reader, the game doesn't have any two player features, nor can it save your high-score once the game's been reset or turned off. But even without these features, this game is a great pick-up and play game with a lot of challenge as you progress through the game multiple times.", "date": "Sep 17, 2002"}
