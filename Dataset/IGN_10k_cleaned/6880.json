The most advanced RPG on PCs, the best-looking Xbox 360 game yet... on mobile? I admit that even though early screens looked promising, and the feature set seemed poised to deliver, I employed a healthy dose of skepticism. But after spending a week with the mobile edition, my fears were put to rest. This is a deep, satisfying action-RPG.   I have logged several hours on the 360 edition of the game. I think it's beautiful and epic. In fact, it's almost too epic for me. The sheer number of options you have in the game - from picking up plates in a farmhouse to herbs in a forest - is almost paralyzing. I remember agonizing over the character creation screen at the beginning of the game. I barely made it through that. But then when I exited the Imperial Sewers, the game gave me another chance to alter my character. ~Crap, should I really be this race? Or choose this constellation?~ That's the kind of stress I don't need.   On some level, this is why I enjoyed the mobile edition. The game delivers an experience set in the Elder Scrolls universe - which is quite well realized - but dials back the outrageous amount of customization and pick-ups. You can still choose your character class and level up, search chests or dead bodies for new weapons and items, but I enjoyed being nudged in the right direction from time to time. I like sandbox experiences, but a global sandbox? Not for me.   In a preview of the game, I mentioned that for Oblivion to succeed on mobile, it would need to invoke the essence of the console/PC game. The final version, which I downloaded from Verizon last week on a VX8000, I believe does just that. It's not just including locations, classes, and monsters from the 360 game that does it (but it certainly helps), but it delivers the easy swordplay, familiar-looking menus, and a seemingly similar storyline.   Oblivion uses contextual controls for navigating the worlds. When you need to jump from one platform to the next in the sewers, you simply walk up to the edge and press to the next ledge. Contextual controls are extremely useful in mobile games (handsets suffer from pretty low-tech inputs), and I'm very happy to see them popping up in more and more titles.   Combat is as easy as walking up to a monster and pressing the action key. A health bar over a monster's head shows how much life they have left. While fighting, keep an eye on your own HP bar, which resides next to your magic supply in the upper-left corner of the screen.   The isometric view works fairly well for this game - even though I'm not a fan of the view for most mobile titles. It really makes controlling the game with the thumbpad non-intuitive. But it lets you see a little more of the dungeon allowing you to spot monsters up ahead. However, the view can sometimes make it difficult to line up attacks.   It's strange, for being based on a game with such incredible production values, the mobile game doesn't break any new ground. The environments look okay with a decent amount of detail, but the emphasis is more on size than texture work. The monster and hero sprites are not terribly strong, though, and I wish they possessed a little more animation. Oblivion opens with a good score, but in the dungeons and battlegrounds, the music falls away for a series of ambient sounds or grunts.Oblivion is a successful action-RPG for mobile that delivers the essence of the 360/PC game. Fans of the Elder Scrolls series that havent necessarily been enthralled by previous mobile games (that would include me) will be pleased by the solid link between the platforms in the case of Oblivion. The game is quite deep  but not overwhelmingly so. Its a good way to get a quick Oblivion fix when you cant be around your PC or 360, trying to cure vampirism. Download it  and bid some free time adieu.", "date": "May 3, 2006"}
