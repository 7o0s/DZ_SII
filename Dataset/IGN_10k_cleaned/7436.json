The gameplay has always been solid enough for a two-dimensional fighter, but it was the sense of discovering special moves that kept us coming back for more.    In Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, that wonderful sense of discovery came with special moves like projectiles, then with combos for each character, then, of course, fatalities, and then babalities, friendships, brutalities, animalities and mercy -- you could play this game for months and still not know it all.    Now on Xbox Live Arcade, UMK3 is a decent game, a faithful port of a fun yet flawed game that longtime fans will love. Others, well, they hate this game.    The Kakoon of Doom. That's mostly because it's a quarter-stealer. The rubber band AI allows you to win a match and in a fashion that's usually way too easy. Then, feeling confident, the next opponent guesses your every move, reacting to projectiles and jumps and combos faster than any human could ever do. After pumping in a few more quarters and losing terribly again and again, the AI will let up on you and give you an easy victory. Until your next opponent.    You get the sense that the computer cheats, and it's a terrible, hollow feeling that eats away at your stomach like an acid spit-ball from Reptile. After continuing enough times, you'll get to the boss characters, the biggest cheaters of them all: Shao Kahn and Motaro. Switch characters enough and continue enough times and you'll beat the game, watch Shao Kahn explode in a green fireball and enjoy the final scene of your character. Still, you're too angry at the CPU to enjoy it.    We have a love-hate relationship with UMK3. That's not the 360s fault, of course. This has been a problem for, like, ever with Mortal Kombat. The 360 does add a bit, most notable online play and leaderboards. Multiplayer and Xbox Live is where this game really shines as your friends don't cheat, and all those hours of memorizing move lists and fatalities finally pays off. Lag is an issue, though most of the time the game doesn't slow down; instead, it pauses for a second or two, interrupting the flow of the match. This is better than slowdown that ruins the timing of combos and special moves, and a necessary evil, I suppose.   The graphics and sound are identical, although you do have the option to stretch the dimensions of the game into widescreen. Other than a healthy dose of achievements, things that should have come with this $10 game are sorely missed, and make you question the value. Not only does the game not come with a practice mode (perfect for, um, perfecting combos and special moves), but there are no control options and not even a move list (quickly remedied with a simple Google search). If any fighter needs a practice mode, it's UMK3, thanks to the hundreds of combos waiting to be discovered and mastered.    For the politically correct, you do have the option of turning off blood and violence, although I have no idea what turning off violence does since you can still roundhouse-kick an opponent in the face, and spray his blood across the screen. Perhaps this turns off fatalities.    The final gripe is the 360 controller itself. With a D-Pad as accurate as Dick Cheney with a shotgun and an analog stick better suited for Halo, performing the tap-tap special moves proves exceedingly difficult. If you still have it, you would be better suited whipping out the old Sega Genesis.   As with most of the classic games on Live Arcade, longtime fans will probably love this game and the online play. In addition to online play, we would have loved to see the option to reconfigure your controls, a practice mode and a $5 price tag.", "date": "Oct 25, 2006"}
