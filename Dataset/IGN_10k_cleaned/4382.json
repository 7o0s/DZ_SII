The Jeopardy Board Game, several versions of Trivial Pursuit, and an old National Geographic puzzle/trivia game I don't recall the name of and is currently collecting dust somewhere in my closet. All were fairly challenging games, but none had the sheer personality of You Don't Know Jack, the popularity of which brought it brief notoriety in 2001 as a weekly TV show starring Paul Reubens, AKA Pee-wee Herman. However, it's been over three years since the last installment, a long time to develop a game with the relatively low production values that come with the trivia genre. While You Don't Know Jack 6 still brings the slightly adult-oriented humor and imaginatively posed questions you've come to know and love, there are a few areas where it disappoints.    Once again, there isn't much new this time. Granted, there's only so much you can do with a trivia game, but the <ydkj  has done some pretty innovative things with question formats with Screw Your Neighbor where you can force an opponent to answer a question but will lose the prize amount from your total if he or she gets it right Gibberish Question where you have to type in an anagram that rhymes with the anagram youre shown and Jack Attack explained below The new installment theres the Lost Gold aspect which incorporates a story of a pirate finding the game on the beach while marooned on an island after a storm. He gets sucked into it somehow and the only way to free him is to earn a bunch of money in the game. Its rather cheesily presented with some over-the-top voice work and pixilated FMV. Of course this cheesiness may be appealing when taken as a part of the usual YDKJ experience, but instead it just feels low-budget and hokey. While the story doesn't interfere with good old-fashioned YDKJ, it will start things off on the wrong foot, depending on your tastes, and never factors into the gameplay.  From there, you enter how many people will be playing (up to three, and no Internet play this time) and what your names are. The categories are amusingly named as usual, and you'll get three to choose from each time, but the prize money is randomly allotted. Sometimes you'll get a chance to win $2000, sometimes $6000, and it doesn't seem to be arranged by difficulty. I would've like to have been able to select how much I wanted to play for, because sometimes you get nailed with a tough question and will lose a big chunk of money. It's not too annoying, though, because there's usually a funny introduction and exit speech that makes it difficult to get annoyed with the game. The host is consistently funny and should create a good vibe when you're playing with a group of people.   Unfortunately, the vibe doesn't last long because there are only 300 questions this time around, half the amount of the previous installment. This is padded by similarly halving the number of questions per round. You get seven, including a ~Dis or Dat~ round where you get a word and decide whether it belongs to one topic or another (or both!), and ~Jack Attack,~ where you get an intentionally vague topic clue and must match an item with a series of words that float around it. For example, the name ~Isaac Newton~ will sit in the center of the screen and others will float up and out. Only one word has the correct association (~apple,~ in this case), and you lose money when you guess wrong. It's a last-turn opportunity to gather a little more prize money to pull ahead of the other players. But having only five multiple-choice questions per game makes for a ten minute experience at most, barely good enough even for a work break.   Character images and animations also didn't make the cut. Instead, the players are represented by animated numbers. This isn't so bad by itself, but it just makes the game feel that much more rushed when taken with the other reductions. Also, the dialogue seems to be using lower-quality audio files, as it sometimes sounds like you're playing over a radio rather than in a studio. The menu animations and bursts of music are still top-notch, however. The core of YDKJ is excellent, but there just aren't a lot of questions to go around, compared to previous versions, some of which were compatible with expansion packs. Removing 'Net play wouldn't be so bad if it hadn't turned out to be such a cool feature last time around. There simply isn't a lot of Jack to know in the first place, unfortunately.", "date": "Jan 15, 2004"}
