If anyone dares to ask me why, I'll just hand him a copy of Motocross Madness.  Microsoft's new supercross racing game portrays the sport in all its agonizing glory -- a fast, maniacal sport that's more fun (and much safer) to watch than it is to participate. You can't help but laugh as your on-screen persona flies through the air with the greatest of ease, and cringe as he slams into the earth like a meteor. This game probably won't do much to recruit people into the real life sport, that's for damn sure.   There's many different ways to play this game. One is to simply kick back and see how wild you can drive these two wheel demons, since each of the thirty tracks can be practiced without any interference from opponents. If you're feeling a little cocky, there's a library of sixteen midair stunts to perform with a controller combination. These show-off moves won't do much to aid you in your racing abilities, but when you actually land the bike after a stunt  (a trick in itself), it's incredibly satisfying. And for the sadists out there, it's a trip to watch your biker tumble and skid across the sand. Can't say I blame you for seeing how many different ways you can smack up your vehicle.  But obviously the real deal is the racing element, and the developers made the competition completely customizable. You can tweak the number of laps, the amount of challengers, even choose the style of bike and rider for the specific type of track. Better still, the game offers some mean competition over the net with up to seven other opponents. Try locking wheels with a bunch of buddies who love to watch you wreck and see how far you can get around the track!  The game is well balanced and a kick to play and the only real complaint spawns from the game's hefty system requirements -- 3D hardware a necessity because of the game's photorealistic imagery. As in most fast-paced games, the smoother the animation, the easier it is to control. So if you don't have the hardware, don't bother with this game.  As a final note, we've been playing Motocross Madness with all sorts of controllers, including force-feedback sticks, control pads, even the keyboard.  But the one controller to keep an eye on is Microsoft's own Sidewinder Sensor. While it controls most racing games well, it really fits this game perfectly with its handlebar shape and control method (you tilt it, and it recognizes the subtle movements left, right, back, and forward). The controller isn't perfectly suited for all types of games, but if you're looking for something different and versatile (as well as something that fits this game like a glove), Microsoft's controller definitely fits the bill. -- Craig Harris", "date": "Sep 3, 1998"}
