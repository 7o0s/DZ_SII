From the detailed graphics, epic story, and excellent gameplay, BioWare reinvented the digital Dungeons & Dragons experience with the original game and last year, the saga continued with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn.  Now we come to the end of the ~trilogy~ with Throne of Bhaal.  For all intents and purposes, Throne of Bhaal is an ~expansion pack~ for Baldur's Gate II, but the disc is fleshed out with so much gameplay and such an incredible conclusion to the story that it could almost be considered a regular installment in the series itself and not just an expansion pack.  In case you haven't played the original Baldur's Gate II, or if you are already going through it right now, I won't spoil too much of the story. Basically, the game opens up with a bang. Bhaalspawn (in other words, you and others like you) are running around causing chaos while they try to wipe out every other Bhaalspawn so that there can only be one in the end (sort of like Highlander). Because of this, there is a huge war going on in the background and your character is smack dab in the middle of everything. Needless to say, the game takes you on a rough ride through city sieges, epic encounter after epic encounter (love them dragons) all the way to the conclusion.   Since Throne of Bhaal is meant to be an earth-shattering conclusion to one of the biggest D&D stories told in recent memory, the expansion allows your characters to basically become more powerful than gods. The experience cap that was 2,900,000 in Baldur's Gate II has been raised to 8,000,000. That means that a character can reach a level anywhere from 31 to 40 depending on their class.   With this power new skills known as High-Level Class Abilities become available. Melee classes receive new fighting skills, Mage classes get to play with level 10 spells, Priests receive Quest spells, while Thieves and Bards get unique skills appropriate to their respective classes. For example, a cool ability that Thieves or Bards can get is Use Any Item. With that skill they are able to use any item even if it is restricted to a single class such as a Mage, which means they could even use a spell scroll. One of the neat things about these new abilities is that many can be used more than once, without having to camp in between each use.   As expected, there are new spells such as the awesome level 10 Mage scroll Dragon's Breath that summons a magical dragon head that breathes fire upon the target. Priests get very powerful Quest level spells including multiple summoning spells that bring in elementals as well as angelic or demonic Devas.   All of these new skills and spells are definitely needed, as Throne of Bhaal is by far the most challenging game in the series. It takes the relentless action from Icewind Dale, and kicks it up a notch with even more deadly encounters that would make most players flee in terror. The creature that you encounter at the end of Watcher's Keep is one of the most powerful beasts in the Monster Manual that will probably take most players a couple tries to defeat. I won't give away the identity of this beast (if you are really serious about spoiling it for yourself, you can probably find the name in a walkthrough somewhere), but lets just say that long time D&D fans will really get a kick out of encountering it in the game.  Speaking of Watcher's Keep, it's a new multi-level dungeon that can be accessed from chapters 2, 3, and 6 from Shadows of Amn as well as right off the bat in Throne of Bhaal. The dungeon is full if expertly designed encounters, traps, and puzzles, and is by far the best dungeon in both the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series of games. It's so good I plan on going through it again. This dungeon alone is good for 15 to 20 hours of pure gameplay, and it is completely separate from the main storyline of the actual game, which lasts for about 25 to 30 hours, but most players will probably spend in excess of 40 on it.   If an extra dungeon to play around in wasn't enough, the game even gives you a new kit to create a character with. The Wild Mage is basically what would happen if you took a Mage and somehow made them completely insane.  They will cast spells at the worst times (possibly even harming or killing themselves in the process) and cast spells that you don't even have memorized. While not the most logical class for someone to play, many people will find them an interesting challenge. If nothing else, the Wild Mage is a fun alternative if you want to try something different for a while.   Graphically, the more powerful spell effects are quite good. When you have a bunch of magic users on the screen all casting their most powerful spells at once, you really start to realize how far the series has come from the first game in terms of graphics. The backgrounds are just as detailed as in Shadows of Amn, and even more beautiful in some instances, while the soundtrack is just as good as it always has been and the spoken dialog is perfect.  Most importantly, Throne of Bhaal continues the excellence in gameplay that was started back in 1998 with the original Baldur's Gate. Not a stone has been left unturned in keeping the game as true to the rule set as possible. The only problem I have ever had with the series is the lack of a true turn-based mode. Sure, you can pause the action, and even have it set to automatically pause, but it doesn't give you the true feeling as a turn-based round does in pen in paper. But that is a very minor complaint when compared to how many things are done right in the games.   The games have always been some of those where you start playing and before you know it six hours have passed, as you are so involved with what is going on. That is the hallmark of a great and potential classic game. Populous had it, Civilization had it, the ~Gold Box~ games had it, and the recent AD&D games have it (especially Planescape).   Not only does Throne of Bhaal bring an end to the series that breathed a fresh breath of life into computer RPGs, but it also raises the bar for future expansion packs. You get over 60 hours of solid gameplay on the disc. Hell, there are full retail games out there that don't even get close to that. Add in an epic conclusion to a huge story, new features, and perfect presentation and you get one of the best role-playing experiences that you can ask for.  --Jeremy Conrad     Want to share your opinions with the world?
