That's the stuff video games are made of -- and apparently a monster blockbuster of a book that will bow as a movie on December 15. Naturally, a mobile game flanks the theatrical release. Published by Vivendi Mobile and developed by Kaolink, Eragon for mobile is a hack-and-slash action game very much in the vein of SEGA's classic Golden Axe.   As the hero Eragon, you cut through wave after wave of enemies, from thuggish soldiers to monstrous brutes. At first, you simply lay on the OK button to chop through bad guys, but as you complete certain episodes, you learn new combos and enhanced magical moves. Soon, magic is uncovered and the hero can burn up bad guys with a flick of the wrist. But for some real firepower, call in Eragon's dragon companion, Saphira. The dragon unleashes a blast of flame that does significant damage to on-screen enemies. It's a great way to halve an oncoming patrol or finish off any pesky enemies with extended life bars. Saphira can only be invoked as long as you have blue magic, so be sure you break open barrels to uncover blue potions.   Saphira is the star of several bonus levels. The dragon flies over the landscape, blazing up bad guys with huge bursts of flame. Keep an eye on Saphira's health bar and fire reserves, because if you just use her breath without thought, you'll find yourself expelling fumes or waiting for a refill while enemies on wooden towers throw axes at the dragon's head. If you fail the bonus level you don't lose any lives, you just miss out on points.   Eragon has two features I particularly enjoyed: Branching paths and some RPG-lite character development. Value is an increasingly important aspect of mobile gaming, and the branching path structure adds reason to replay the game -- especially for an Eragon fan -- to see the entirety of the storyline. You won't ever miss an absolutely pivotal plot point due to the branching paths (none of which will be revealed here), but you will discover different scenery and enemy patterns. As for the PRG elements, after finishing a big scene, Eragon steps into a clearing with four different bags. You can pick up only a couple bags, which contain power-ups to increase traits like your magic performance, melee combat skills, or health bar length. Your first few upgrades simply round out the character, but if you really lay on increasing melee combat, you'll have no problems slicing through enemies later in the game. Your magic skills, however, will be fairly weak. So many games include character customization features, but Eragon joins a small cadre of titles where the customization actually makes a noticeable difference in game play.   However, Eragon's main mechanics are just too simple. As soon as you learn the first magic power-up, a combo that swings the sword and then releases green fire magic, the game becomes something of a cakewalk. But even without the combo moves or Saphira's fire blasts, many of the enemies can be defeated by just hammering the OK key. They don't fight back very ferociously, and red potion health refills aren't that scarce, even in later levels. If you really juice your health bar in the customization tool, killing Eragon is a task few enemies are really up to. In one situation, I pushed a handful of enemies off-screen and just stood there pressing the OK key -- while looking at my dog, not the phone -- for a few moments. When I looked back, the bad guys were dead and I hadn't lost a sliver of health.   The game looks pretty good, with decently detailed character sprites. Sephira seems to have enjoyed the most attention, as the dragon sprite is by far the prettiest. The backdrops are typically fantasy fare. I played the game on a handful of phones -- beating it on the LG VX8100, but also sampling on the new LG VX9900 (enV), Chocolate, and the KRAZR. The enV and Chocolate each featured parallax scrolling backdrops that reminded me -- pleasantly -- of a Genesis side-scrolling beat-'em-up.   One extra feature in Eragon worth pointing out: You can earn a cheat code used in the PlayStation 2 and Xbox editions of the game. Apparently, it unlocks ~fury mode.~ I don't have the game on either of those consoles, so I was unable to test it out.  Eragon is not enough of a challenge -- the game is far too easy. And while that may disappoint any hardcore gamers, fans of the book will certainly appreciate Kaolink's adherence to the source material. The storyline is accurate (according to a huge Eragon fan I know), the locations are ripped from the book, and the ability to invoke Saphira is sure to be a pleaser. If you just want to chill with Saphira and not bust your thumbs, Eragon will likely satisfy. But if you want something you won't burn through in an hour or so, check out the other corner's of your carrier's deck.", "date": "Dec 7, 2006"}
