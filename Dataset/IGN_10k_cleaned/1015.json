They say, ~Oh yeah, it's a great action racer with really fun graphics and all kinds of power-ups.~ Then we all play the game, and the end product has less thrill than playing as the ball in Pong.  But what ho? A driving game that books, an action-racer with actual action? All in a pseudo-3D perspective? And it's fun? And, and I get to drive the classic Dick Dastardly Mean Machine? Buckle me in, boys. This is my kind of race! Features Eight racers and nine tracks from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon  Incredible scaling 3D graphics engine Four race modes  Password save  Only for Game Boy Color   I can chitter-chatter for a while about Infogrames' Wacky Races, but anything I would say would just spin itself back down to a testimonial of this game's beautiful, incredible graphics, so why not start there. This is the most realistic, speediest, and gorgeous pocket racer on any system, bar none. From the perfectly detailed racers (including Penelope Pitstop's Compact Pussycat and the Slag Brothers' Boulder-Mobile, complete with animated cavemen characters at the helm) to the colorful cartoonish backdrops, the game captures the style of the show.  The technical prowess flexed in this game is just astonishing. Have you ever witnessed a Game Boy Color racer that felt fast? I mean, really fast? In many ways, it can't be done. The system can't scale sprites, so 3D racing from the driver's view just can't be done, and it certainly can't be done with rolling hills or roadside detail. Apparently, however, that rule means nothing to the amazing two-man design team behind this game. They are throwing everything at the Game Boy Color, and it's working. Check out our video of the game in action to see what's up -- see how fast that looks? Well, that's just badly compressed video. The actual game looks twice as sharp, without all of that splotchy color, and it scales much, much smoother. We ran the game against Atari's Checkered Flag on the superior Lynx system (which handles true scaling) and found that this Game Boy title outperforms it for all practical purposes. It almost seems like the game designers are bragging by adding a Turbo Boost that doubles the car's speed. Fellows, it's moving fast enough -- Please Hammer, don't hurt 'em!  All that muscle better add up to a heck of a game, and while Wacky Races stumbles much in this department, it's still better by far than the average Game Boy Color racer. Unfortunately, despite the inclusion of weapons and dozens of challengers, the excitement level is short-lived. The tracks are mostly gentle turns with very few jumps, and only by the very end of the game in the Hawaii level does the track design start to get interesting. Hills roll and lull, making opponents a great challenge to face off against, but only one enemy car is allowed in your vicinity at a time, and there's no link play to really enjoy the gameplay against a competent racer.  That's not to say that the game isn't a blast to play. It just tires quicker than it should. AI is good, and it gets much stronger with increasing difficulty levels (they swerve to take your power-up and bump you off the road when running neck and neck), but it's still a lonely race, especially since the foes seem doomed to only defensive weapons like bombs (which, mysteriously, you cannot pick up anywhere on the track) instead of the missiles players can fire. Getting out in first is the end-all to the game. But if you keep up in the pack and come up short when the power-ups roll your way, prepare yourself for the race of a lifetime.   Did I mention that the game's designers programmed a transparency effect? Oh, and they added a fog effect too -- just for style points, and by the way, it bests the fog on most N64 titles in quality. The only thing missing is a lighting effect on the New York level, and I think the designers just ran out of time -- the light poles are there.The engine is bravado, and it is almost a given that the gameplay would pale in comparison. It does, sadly, but not as poorly as I worried it might. It's a solid racer, and the sense of speed makes gameplay fun even when the rest of the design starts to fail. This is a brilliant pick-me-up game, and with lots of hidden cars, there's plenty here to play through. Infogrames has Wacky Races set to be one of their top franchises, and they're assigning some stellar talents to the different versions (just look at the amazing Dreamcast version), so hopefully a sequel is in the plans with more challenges and extremely wild races. This game is a swell rough draft, a blazing play that just falls short of greatness. Still, what a rush!", "date": "Jun 14, 2000"}
