While they had been slipping towards geekdom and the path to a lucrative career in video game journalism and criticism already, it was that game that sealed the deal. A few of years back, when I first started working here, X-COM was also voted the number 1 PC game of all time by the 5 editors that were working on the site at the time. Since that time, we've seen Tal and Steve's hopes dashed by the cancellation of X-COM: Alliance, and then pieced back together by the announcement of the ~true~ progeny of X-COM: UFO Defense, called UFO: Aftermath. Sorry to disappoint you guys, but like the sequels to the original that just never captured the same feeling of the first, UFO: Aftermath just isn't as good as the classic, both in character and in gameplay.   UFO: Aftermath is a squad based, tactical strategy game at heart. The story follows the invasion and near annihilation of all life on the planet by an alien invasion. The bastards went and released a cloud of spores into the atmosphere, which eventually fell to the surface, killing or mutating nearly all forms of life with the exception of some ~lucky~ few, of which you are one. You'll take the reigns of the defense of the planet and begin to fight back to take your home back from the invaders.   The story itself is presented fairly blandly, which is sad because it actually has a bit more depth to it than the story in the original X-COM. You'll have to uncover quest missions to learn the reason behind the attacks and how to stop them eventually. Those that remember X-COM will remember the fun and excitement that the opening comic book style intro planted into the experience right from the start. You'll also remember the fun aliens and their wicked attacks on cities and the planet in general. You'll get none of that here. Aftermath takes a much more serious approach to things and suffers for it. It's not that the idea is bad, it's just the presentation of that idea. There are no cutscenes to propel the story along. This didn't need main characters, but something to showcase new knowledge and give a little bit of a reward would have been nice.      In fact, the graphics and presentation in general aren't so hot. Characters and aliens are mostly uninspired (even though I have a guilty weak spot for the gigantic Car Crab). Terrain in outdoor areas isn't badly textured, but can be boring as hell, especially after you've seen it so many times (more on that in a second). The good spots come from the look of the city portions of the game. There's some good texture and artwork here. But once again, you'll be seeing this same stuff over and over because the levels are randomly generated using a select palette. Thankfully, building styles can change depending on your location in the world, just as the terrain does, to add a bit more spice to your game.   Any fans of the original will see similarities immediately. The game begins by loading up a 3D globe of Earth, only missing city locations. From this area, you'll pick a starting zone, instead of actually choosing a point to place your first base.   Bases in Aftermath are handled in a much different manner. Instead of constructing a base from pieces, having to assign scientists and engineers to labs, and actually laying out your bases in a strategically helpful way, you'll be charged with taking many, many bases located throughout the world. Once you've captured one of these bases, you can leave it as a military base (from which you can launch your Chinook transport helicopter out onto missions) or change it into an engineering base or research base. The more research bases you have, the faster your research will go. The more engineering bases you have, the faster your development of equipment and technologies will go. None of these bases can have their layouts changed. So when the aliens attack one of them, you'll have to defend what is basically a randomized base that has so many weak spots you'll think it was planned by the Charger's defensive coordinator. Frankly, I liked the old way better. While it makes the game a little easier to manage and streamlines research and development a bit, it also dumbs the process down too much. If you do end up losing a base to alien attack... who cares? You've got 30 more scattered around the world.   This seems to be the road chosen for this remake. Simplify! For instance, fighter planes, which you used to have to build hangars for, as well as repair and refuel, now seem to be limitless in their numbers. If your fighter planes are shot down by the alien spacecraft they were sent to combat, it matters very little.    In fact, whether you actually get to a mission on time or not, regardless of it's priority levels, doesn't seem to matter either. In X-COM, there was a definite priority response to crisis. If you and your team didn't save a town in time, you would lose funding from the country in question. Here there are no penalties aside from the possibility of a minor setback in amount of owned territory. Money has been removed from the equation altogether. You'll have so many salvaged weapons and gear by the time battles start getting challenging that you'll be able to outfit 10 groups of 7 instead of the one that you're allowed to send out on missions.    From the world map, you can also move to those R&D and squad management screen. The R&D interface is put together simply and effectively, detailing what you have to have to develop new technologies and research new things while breaking each up into categories that can be easily recognized. On the same note, the squad management screen is much more helpful than anything that you will remember from X-COM. Here, you'll be able to outfit your team with different weapons (of which there will be many varieties to choose from) and armor, check out stats, train, give new call signs, check out medical progress, and set up the squad that will take on the next mission you accept.   Squad building is one of the strong suits in Aftermath. Your soldiers will each gain levels as they participate in combat. Every time they come away from a mission alive and well, they'll gain experience and eventually gain a level. At each level gain, the soldier can be given more points into one of six attributes that also will affect several skills. It's good that you're able see the changes that upping each of the attributes will make on the skills, but I also would have liked to see what attributes need to be at what levels to train in each profession, which will allow your soldiers even more expertise in various skills.   Once you've got your squad put together and head out to the battlefield, you'll see the pulsing heart of this game. This is also where I'll begin to contradict myself about some things and become wishy-washy about others. For the first long while you're playing this game, you'll be coming up against transgenents (nasty creatures that have been corrupted by the spores and biomass). Sometimes they'll carry weapons; sometimes they'll have ~natural~ weapons. But they're easy nearly all of the time. Once you get into fighting with the aliens, things get interesting; it's just too bad that this takes so long to get into. They'll have much more powerful weapons and use more complex strategies such as flanking maneuvers. Up until the point that you begin fighting aliens, none of my soldiers died, and I could pretty much just run through levels with all of them grouped together. Once you start against aliens with grenades and other heavy explosive weapons, this is a bad idea...     Levels are all randomized depending how long you've been playing the game, where in the world the mission is, and what type of mission is given. There are several types of missions, but they're all a bit repetitive in terms of terrain and goals. You'll be eliminating all enemies in an area, collecting specimens and technology, doing surveillance work, rescuing downed pilots, and capturing bases. Unfortunately, you do so many of them that they start to get dull. It's nice to have randomized missions, but having missions that aren't designed means that levels can either be fun, or just a rush through without challenge or thought. I found myself just running through base capture missions just trying to get farther into the game for something more interesting. You would think that infiltrating a base, going room by room, and trying to kill things would be more exciting. Mostly it's just an annoyance having to get your units from one place to another down narrow paths (while some of them decide to take the long route around through unexplored territory...) in order to find the random enemies stuck in the last damn place you look.   The real problem I have with the game comes not from the actual combat, which I did find interesting (not all the time, but some of it), is the interface. While some of it was decent, such as having each squad member's portrait at the bottom for easy selection, there were several things that I wanted, that just weren't there. Highest on my list of wishes was a quick-change action that you could set up for soldiers to switch out certain loadouts with the press of a button, instead of having to leave the game screen, enter the interface screen, and drag and drop every weapon and item that you want to use from your belt and backpack to your hands and vice-versa. I could have understood the backpack needing a bit more time, but grenades should be hanging on your belt anyway, why to you have to put your weapon into your backpack in order to use the things? Actually managing your inventory is a pain in the ass as well. If you do decide to switch weapons, you better have room in your backpack to put the weapon in your hands because you can't just drag one over the other assuming they'll just switch places. Hell, half the time you'll need to drop something on the ground and the pick it back up to switch weapons. It slows the game down to have to fight with the inventory every time you need to break out a health pack or switch weapons. I just ended up leaving my backpack half empty most of the time just so things were more convenient.    When it comes down to giving orders, I have mixed feelings about some things. When moving your squads around, you'll actually see the path of your units on the ground, where they'll pause, and if you've given them an order to carry out after they've reached their destination. These are all good things. The problem is, in certain situations, such as after an enemy has been killed or an order has been carried out, the unit that killed the creature (which is every unit shooting at it) or completing the order, will automatically be selected by the computer. So if you're in the middle of giving an order to a unit without orders and the game is running in real-time, you may suddenly find yourself giving orders to the wrong soldier without realizing it. You can turn a lot of this nonsense off, which is a sanity saver, especially because the game defaults to pause after every order is completed. When you have seven guys, this can be seriously annoying. Every two seconds you'll have control switched to a different character for you. Also, when giving move commands to a group, they'll always bunch together at the destination. There's no way to keep them in the spread formation they started in.   On top of that, if you've given a string of commands to a group of units, they'll have to wait for each one to catch up before they move onto the next order. For example, if you move a group of four into a room along with a command to fire at an enemy at the end of the move, those characters that get to the end first will just be standing there, not firing, waiting for the last guy, who is a smidgeon slower to get there before they fire. This isn't the dinner table, just fire already. If they wanted to do it that way, all of the units should have just moved at the same speed as the slowest man. Along those lines, I also wish that these units could fire as they move for a small accuracy cost. In close quarter battles, that could make a huge difference. The real Army can do it, why can't these guys?   My last interface complaint comes from not having any way of knowing how much sound you're making (which can make a difference) and not being able to hear enemy movement at all. Humans have ears too. Hell, we even have listening devices to hear better.   But hey, if my units can't hear, at least they won't have to listen to the atrocious unit acknowledgements. Really guys... yuck. I don't know who recorded these things, but they're really, really bad. Especially that Chinese accent, which sounded like someone was choking Kermit the Frog.   UFO: Aftermath is in a lot of ways, very much the same as X-COM: UFO Defense. Unfortunately, it was only partly like it, with less of the features and less strategy. While the interface is arguably better than X-COM all around, compared to other games made these days, it's lacking in style and functionality. I think a lot of these interface and order problems have to do with the decision to go both turn-based and real-time together. While it was certainly a noble attempt, it just didn't work together as well as it might have. I think this could have been a great game either with a pure action point turn-based system like the old one or straight real-time with a pause and give orders feature.While Aftermath isn't a bad game, and certainly has some wonderful and fun ideas, it just doesn't compare to other squad based tactical games I've played lately like Silent Storm (turn-based) or Commandos 3 (real-time). If the strategy and options between missions had been more in-depth and creative than the original, my opinion or this game might have been better. After such a long and arduous road of development for this game, I was hoping for a more polished piece of software. Where they should have took leaps forward, they fell back or sidestepped. Sadly, even without giving it the tough task of direct comparison to its predecessor, UFO: Aftermath comes up a bit short.", "date": "Oct 14, 2003"}
