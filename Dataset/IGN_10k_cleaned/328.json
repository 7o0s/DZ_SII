Even though the game is completely substandard in design, at least it would have had a chance being sold on the shelves -- being one of the only color golf titles available to the handheld. But with the Nintendo golf offering taking up the shelf space with Natsume's, Hole in One Golf doesn't have a chance. Features Three courses Battery backed Link cable support for two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   Let's just get right down to it and list the things that are wrong with the game: Poor and confusing interface. Sure, getting right into the game is not a problem, but once in, it's a lost cause.  Instead of the more intuitive ~vertical~ view of the overhead course (best simulating a behind the player perspective), you golf from right to left. What's more, you're so close to the ball that you can only see a hundred yards ahead of it.  The graphics don't make aiming that much easier, either. You target your shot a mere 50 or so yards ahead of your ball. Beyond that, it's anyone's guess where the ball's going to head -- so you're stuck drawing a mental line from your ball to the hole by scrolling the screen beyond the viewable area. And worse, it's near impossible to judge distances in this game. There aren't any visible marks to note that a tree is thirty yards ahead of the ball, or the dogleg turns left about 200 yards into the course.  And then there's the hitting mechanics. If you had better control over when it starts it wouldn't be so bad -- but as it is, the golfer immediately starts his swing as soon as you leave the overhead view of the course. So you better be ready right when you hit that button to proceed to the next screen, since you have to hit the button at the power point of the swing meter, and on which point of the ball you'll hit. Poor ball physics. One of the keys to a good golf sim is its focus on how the ball moves. In Hole in One Golf, there really doesn't seem to be a set pattern the way the ball floats through the air. Sure, it follows the current of air and bounces differently on the terrain, but the ball just doesn't move naturally, whether it is in the air or bouncing on the ground. Annoying sound. Admittedly, the Game Boy system doesn't have powerful hardware, but what Natsume does in Hole in One Golf is downright irritating. The game really only has one tune to play, but it restarts after every screen change. So you really only hear the first five seconds of the tune repeating over and over again.  But let's be fair. What it does right: Three courses. Diversity is key, and at least Natsume created three different courses to kick up the variety a bit. Random creature encounters. Sometimes creatures will enter the picture and help or hinder your ball lie -- for example, a perfect hit might net you a perfect lie on the course, but a bear might run across the screen to knock your ball into a sand trap. It's this surprise element that makes the game a bit unpredictable.   I'm just going to come right out and say it: don't buy this game. Buy Mario Golf instead. There's nothing in Hole in One Golf that you can't get in Mario Golf (except for black-and-white support, since Mario Golf is Color exclusive), and the game is more work than fun. And we all know games aren't supposed to be work...right?", "date": "Oct 19, 1999"}
