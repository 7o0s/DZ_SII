It's a niche market we aggressive, sci-fi loving space combat enthusiasts crave, but a market that nonetheless satisfies our violent and dogfight thirsting hearts when done right.   Wing Commander, Tie Fighter, Freespace, Starlancer... Yes, we bought them all and loved each and every minute of the Shivan slaughtering, Coalition ass beating and Kilrathi taunting. And afterward we all went out and purchased PlayStations just to enjoy the marvel of Colony Wars and GameCube's just to see the beauty of Rogue Leader. Now we sit here staring at the first half of 2003 gritting our teeth. We've been deprived of our precious genre for too long and are now wondering when salvation will come and once again swoop us up in its arms and carry us off into the depths of the eternal void to answer the cry of a galactic war. We want our cockpits sealed, our souls soothed by the absolute zero enveloping us, and our senses heightened by the fire and concussive death bursting across our hulls.  Believe me, I've been waiting a long time for this moment. My computer may still have all of the aforementioned PC titles installed on it (however nonfunctional they may now be), but to at long last boot up a final of Freelancer and indulge that ever-present, star-reaching side of my persona, to see the culmination of five years of nerve rattling tumultuous development unfold before my eyes is what I live for. This is why I play games. This is why I write about them. Don't let that statement pass you by like the flaming wreck of a Dralthi never to be noticed again, it's important. For as much grief as we give development teams for their constant delays and often broken promises, it's moments like these -- those few seconds before and after a long and passionate kiss -- that keep us all young at heart, that keep us all wondering throughout our day what the next turn in the game will be, what the next plot development is, or how we're going to blow the turrets off that capital ship without getting pummeled by its many friends. Freelancer is that game to make you obsess. I think about it at work, I think about it in the car, and if I were cool enough to have a social or love life, I'd imagine I'd think about it then, while participating in whatever activities such things require.   My friends, Microsoft and Digital Anvil's troubled space title gone killer, open-ended action romp is finished...and reviewed!  It's been an MMO. It hasn't been an MMO. It's been a space-sim. It hasn't been a space-sim. It's been an on-rails shooter. It hasn't been an on-rails shooter. And now, finally sweet, awesome now, it's done. No talking, no delays, no changes, just done. But before you purchase Freelancer you're going to have to know whether or not you'll want to purchase Freelancer. If you're an Insider or are thinking about becoming one (there's a free trial), hit up the video review below and enjoy several minutes of freelance talking atop several minutes of clipped freelance footage. It'll give you a solid impression of what to expect from the game and requires little brainpower to understand (Dan's even in it).  400 x 300 High-Res Video Review - 57MB 320 x 240 Low-Res Video Review - 33MB  Since I can't say everything in a single review, check out our huge ass preview for more general facts and impressions. Now that the obligatory, ~we also offer this~ statement is out of the way, on with the show.   You'll like Freelancer. You'll love Freelancer. You'll be disappointed by Freelancer. And, in the end, you'll want more Freelancer.   It may have been in development for six years (I believe that's the current count; it's hard to recall exactly), but the six years have treated the game well. Odd, seriously drastic design changes were occurring throughout and generally when we see this happen in the industry we're left with unfinished products that rarely find their footing. Freelancer has no such problems, nor does it exhibit any of the symptoms associated with spiraling development and endless feature creep. It's a game that knows exactly what it is: a straight up, accessible, intuitive shooter with a brilliantly crafted universe that allows and indeed forces players to enjoy the action on a much grander, much more awesome level.  Sometime after the events of Starlancer, the Coalition has managed to all but crush the noble, free Alliance. In desperation, and classic Starsiege fashion, Alliance nations rally to runaway. Yup, rather than continually fight, five great factions stuff hundreds of thousands or even millions of their own people into ~sleeper ships~ and hurl them across the galaxy to colonize distant worlds and keep the race alive. 800 years later in the Sirius sector, Freelancer begins.   It all starts with presentation. Sirius is ready to be explored, but is only navigable and enjoyable because productions values in Freelancer are soaring through the roof. An utterly brilliant interface that's both simple and intuitive kicks presentation off and actually remains the single, defining aspect of Freelancer that keeps the title different, fresh, and at the same time cool.   Everything is driven by a mouse and a keyboard. Unanimously, space combat buffs reacted by wincing and shaming the clearly blasphemous decision to forsake the god who created the Sidewinder Precision Pro (Sidewindicus). I was one of them, but upon play, winces quickly faded and made way for much applause. Like you will, I realized that not only is the combination of a mouse and keyboard critical to properly manipulating and exploiting the many finer points of Freelancer, but is also a fun way of killing folks. Fun.   Piloting is such a snap that it almost hurts, begging the question, why the hell haven't more people done this before? It's smooth, slick, responsive, but never overly easy. In this way, the feel of piloting a spacecraft is retained, and thus a sense of accomplishment is present whenever an enemy is downed or a dense debris field is split, but it's never a chore. While I'll be the first to agree that nothing will ever, ever replace true space dogfighting as the digital world has created and games like Freespace have perfected, but Freelancer's simple, familiar mouse to aim and turn and keyboard to propel and control schema perfectly suits a title that focuses heavily on exploration and blazing combat.       How we interface with the ship and menus is perhaps why it all works and works so well. Manipulating the many functions of the HUD and menu system on the fly and during any situation is a vital skill learned in approximately three minutes. It's that good. Since each menu includes a wealth of subtext to indicate what's what, moving through the somewhat complex but always graceful interface is a snap. And there's so much that's made available and that needs to be referenced so often, any other control scheme simply would not suffice. Think about targeting.    In my extensive experience with the latest beta (more than 20 hours), I could have sworn that there was no visible cockpit to be found, but now that I have played the final for even longer, I see differing struts, some more intentionally obstruction than others, for every craft available. Since flight combat is approached in a completely different manner when played from the cockpit, targeting subsystems, something I previously disregarded as being useless in the beta, is now useful. The cockpit makes it enjoyable, the mouse makes it functional, and the reward for doing such a thing makes it an integral part of play.   To the bottom left of the screen lies a simple innocuous little portion of the HUD reserved for nearby targets and the functions that can be applied to them (hailing, scanning, etc.). Like all HUD segments, (a testament to the general polish present in nearly every facet of Freelancer), this little square can be minimized and entirely removed from the scene. Anyway, with this targeting HUD, it's possible to cycle nearby objects of relevance by type, and then even by subsystem, where applicable. Simply unlock the cursor from free flight mode and point and click. Hit the wing of the 3D representation of a targeted craft on the HUD and that wing will be targeted. During combat, when you fire at the lead indicator and impact, you'll do specific damage to the component you've targeted, disabling weapons and perhaps leaving a more intact cargo to be pilfered, which may or may not happen.   The point is that this is but a small example of what can be done in Freelancer that's just not possible without the precision a mouse offers. Even dropping a stick into your lap and picking up your Dual Optical or Explorer would get tiring, for when you're not fighting, you're clicking many other things.   Outstanding presentation values continue to soak nearly ever other nook and cranny of the game's interface. Player information pages convey exactly to what degree factions like or dislike you and even who likes and hates the people that like and hate you. It's nuts. Descriptions of everything, including yourself, round that one out. The inventory screen knows what's in your hold and so will you when you click on it. Best of all is the map, which allows for easily set inner and inter system quickest path waypoints that capitalize off of the game's many jump points and trade lanes, so that it's not just a straight line you're traveling on. Additionally, it's on the map that you can identify the patrol routes of hostile and friendly folks -- good for smuggling, avoiding, or hunting. It's truly amazing. The level of thought and planning and polish put into every corner of the interface shines from start to finish. Never, not once, ever did I feel inhibited by the interface. Information can be accessed so quickly that it's scary, but still only as easy and useable as it is because everything plays off of the mouse and keyboard. It's the backbone we're talking about here. Go ahead and land, you'll just realize there's even more to it.  This is where Freelancer turns into somewhat of a point and click adventure. Unfortunately, walking around a planet or station in full control of your character is not possible. Instead, simple click and go is all that's available. In classic Wing Commander/Starlancer fashion, on-foot travel comes tied together via non-interactive transitional sequences. Herein lies the beginning of my biggest gripe with Freelancer, for as huge, dynamic, and wondrous a universe as the game has managed to create, it simply does not have the level of depth we've come to expect from such a creation. This is no Baldur's Gate. There are no branching conversations and no distinct and identifiable personas that inhabit certain places. There isn't even a simple Wing Commander-esque yes/no option to conversations (accepting and declining missions with no consequence does not count). In a sense, it's almost a step backward in this regard. You go to places and see things and do things, but all the while you're left craving that extra bit of interaction and development that never comes. But relief is abundant.   News briefs, personal diary entries, rumors, and things of the like all help make the universe feel more cohesive and believable. Even if the aural component is unnecessary, the text is plenty. For the commodities traitor and wannabe bounty hunter, the news briefs give hints on what to trade and where to go to find action, while the personal diary entries help further develop the critical, albeit totally linear storyline that's woven throughout Freelancer.  The sheer amount of history present makes the trip worthwhile. In the same way Ultima VII included an assortment of books that could be read just for the sake of being read and in the same way MechWarrior included pages after countless pages of fiction, Freelancer bolsters and reaffirms a sometimes shaky methodology of universal development and interaction by delivering a staggering amount of content to be enjoyed. As mentioned, more awesome still is that every last damn bit of this content helps the game in someway or at the very least creates the illusion of helping the game. The mystery thickens as certain news briefs detail political turmoil. Your mind tightens as others mention that perhaps there is money to be made in smuggling artifacts into Liberty. Your palms sweat as best prices and stock tickers indicate where goods are being sold low and bought high. It's all extremely slick.   Still, if you're looking for the most involved RPG experience on the face of the planet, you'll not find it here. The plot is straightforward, perhaps more than it needs to be, and the side missions, of which there are none of any real substance, do little to tie your character into the greater, evolving Sirius sector.   Aside from outrageous wants and desires, simple cues from Mercenaries and Privateer coupled with a little more in-cockpit developments and integrated subquests could have alleviated this often nagging problem and perhaps made an awesome game a perfect game. Hell, a Morrowind plug-in functionality would do the trick.  Each side mission is standalone and unsurprising. You may have multiple waypoints and a few developments, but it can be a little tiresome after a billion hours of play. What the game needs are subquests, a better use for the hail option (perhaps, like Privateer, receiving incoming hails and having the option to accept or deny their requests, thus affecting the reputation of your player, should have been implemented), and more surprises along the way. And where's my Mercenaries style coliseum where I can earn money by fighting in tournaments, simultaneously affecting my reputation?      Speaking of Mercenaries, some other faults of Freelancer are due to not being able to store and maintain a garage of cool stuff. It's the Diablo of its kind: intuitive, simplistic, but sometimes repetitive because it simply lacks the depth of others. Being able to own multiple ships at a time (yes, you can only have one at any given point), a large cache of items, and a squad of wingmen which you can hire and develop, all in true Mercenaries form, would have been terrific. I'd likely never play anything else if it were this way. Digital Anvil could have tied such things into the economy and reputation system. They could have cost money to store on planets and stations and money to transport long distances. Reputation would have raised and lowered depending on whom you hired to fill your roster. Later, why not buy your own capital ship and store things there? This level of caring that comes from owning and keeping possessions, including wingmen, is what Freelancer lacks. Because of this the game remains intuitive and simple but then shallow if looked at with an RPG loving slant.   Without all of these requirements of the genre, Freelancer is somewhat of a failing role-playing game. But, it cannot, under any circumstances be taken as a failing RPG. No, it's an action title that offers up more, so much more, in fact, that its allure is literally undeniable.  Think of any shooter, toss in the ability to explore a seamless universe from front to back, add in an inventory, character development, and then the obligatory plot and you get what you got. With just the campaign alone, Freelancer would remain a passable action title, but the fact that it marvelously ties in the extras that it does, however lacking some may see the extras as being, makes the title stand far above any other stock shooter. It's also because of the extra that the action doesn't bore.    Since it's all about the mouse and keyboard, shooting doesn't involve the kind of skill that dogfighting does, and thus, without advanced maneuvering, the extra is required to make the normal good -- a good that is propelled to excellent when the technical brilliance that powers the game is beheld.    Amazing is Freelancer's word of the day. It's amazing that it works, amazing that it isn't ugly, amazing that it's simply gorgeous. It's not pretty because the explosions are the best ever (capital ships blow brilliantly while fighter blasts aren't up to Starlancer or Freespace levels, let alone Hegemonia) or because ships are enormous (this is not Tachyon, so be prepared). No, the graphics are good because of five things: scale, polish, vibrancy, quantity, and sheen.  Universes are big. We only have one that we know of and comprehending its size and nature are mental feats best left to mathematicians who see the world in algorithms. Even comparatively miniscule chunks of the universe are astronomically large, literally. The Sirius sector is no different. While the singleplayer game will take a couple of weeks to plow through (critical missions are cleverly spaced out and dependant on player levels), the universe itself is enormous and worth seeing. Everything except for the stars is approachable and sewn together nearly seamlessly. Flying into and out of a nebula, a debris field, and around a planet to reach a jump gate to travel to another solar system just must be experienced to be believed.   And it's not a sparsely populated, approachable universe, either. Ships are everywhere, planets are enormous, space stations dot every corner and debris fields are incredibly dense. The sheer quantity of it all puts other titles to shame. No particular item when taken alone is detailed enough to warrant merit, but when it all comes together, it's stellar, colorful, and extremely diverse.   This is not the space we know. Color and light are everywhere and play off of every object with perfect precision. Smooth, crisp lighting drapes and illuminates vessels as futuristic ships should be lit. Weapon blasts highlight all and nothing stands still. The universe always moves, all the time, and is always smooth.  Radeons have a problem running the game well due to text and voice screwing everything up, but a simple turn down of the Windows hardware acceleration level fixes that right up. Aside from that problem, Freelancer is incredibly stable. We've run the game on four completely different computers and at varying settings (usually maxed), and it just runs well, which is good because enjoying Ian Ziering's portrayal of Trent, the disgruntled freelancer gone hero, can't be enjoyed any other way.   Yup, Steve from 90210 does a pretty darn good job of playing the part and making it work. Other voices are all spot on as is the music, taken from the annals of always appreciated stock space game tunes. Sound effects are better. I can't reiterate this enough, it's the little details that count. It's the way each effect changes when in the cockpit mode and the way each is subtly different from the last. If only the future had some radios that didn't sound all scratchy. Humanity has mastered space travel but can't afford PCS phones? Wha?  Even Ian can't save bad direction, but then he doesn't have to. Each transition and plot developing cutscene is excellent. Since they're all in-game, players are never jarred away from the title. Since they involve bold camerawork, for a videogame, they're always interesting. Digital Anvil wasn't afraid of zooming in on a bland texture or not exaggerating the animations of its models, and the effect is great.  What did you think of Freelancer?  And we're left with multiplayer. Not quite the MMO some wanted, Freelancer does still allow players to setup their own persistent worlds where a group of players can partake in any of the side missions against the standard singleplayer AI, which ranges from ass poor level 1 scrubs to level 20 aces, depending. I'm not sure how interesting this will be in the long run. Since the singleplayer game can be enjoyed far past the conclusion of the storyline the addition of a similar multiplayer component seems a bit redundant. Taking on side missions with friends has some appeal, but to what end? There is no real gain from collecting money and buying things since characters created on a specific server cannot be ported to another, but it does lay the groundwork for a potential MMO expansion or sequel, if such a thing were to happen (years ago both were options during development). Without differing types of classic multiplayer modes (deathmatch, team deathmatch, CTF, etcetera), it can seem a bit lacking. Nevertheless, the pseudo-MMO is a sweet addition to an already superb game.On paper Freelancer is less than exciting. When described it may seem that shortcomings resident in many of its fundamentals may make it less than worthwhile. But in motion, for hours on end, the sum of its parts come together to craft a whole that's so wonderfully and lovingly polished that fans of games in general owe it to themselves to pick up a copy. Joy comes from every corner of Freelancer... Every component plays off of every other. You are Trent. You are the Freelancer. Complex actions can be dealt with easily thanks to an outstanding interface. A real sense of accomplishment can be felt thanks to a forgiving style of play. An eerie Zen-like calming and soothing sensation can be appreciated when approaching a friendly planet or just flying. Excitement, intrigue and scale are all here.Is Freelancer perfect after so many years of development? No. Is it great and still worth the time and money?
