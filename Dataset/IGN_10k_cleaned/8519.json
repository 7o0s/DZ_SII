Not that the developers of this Nintendo DS game aren't doing anything new for the touch screen rendition, but let's be real: all the elements in Touch the Dead's place -- its scenario, its gameplay...even its title -- is derived from SEGA's classic light gun shooter. That said, the Eidos-published DS title isn't too shabby of an original Nintendo DS product. It's fun and challenging...but original? Not in the slightest.   Last year, you might remember that Namco proved with its DS rendition of Point Blank -- a design that originally focused on pin-point precise shots with a light gun peripheral -- could work as a Nintendo DS that put the system's touch screen to use in the gun's place. So it's no surprise that handheld developers are slowly approaching that genre for their own designs on the handheld.    Touch the Dead isn't just inspired by SEGA's House of the Dead, it almost rips the franchise off wholesale. In this game, you're faced with the challenge of working your way through seemingly endless corridors filled with all sorts of undead creatures. Right from the start you'll conveniently stumble upon a revolver, and, conveniently again, your pockets are brimming with an endless supply of bullets. As you work your way through the levels zombies will attack head-on, and through the use of the touch screen you'll simply blast away by tapping on them with the Nintendo DS stylus. Anything goes: head, arm, leg, and belly shots -- these creatures will go down with a few well placed shots, but you'll have to be quick. The pistol's chamber only holds a set amount of ammunition, so reloading at the proper time comes into play almost as frequently as firing the weapon.   So yeah, if you've played House of the Dead, you're pretty much in familiar territory with this Nintendo DS ~inspiration.~ That's not to say that Touch the Dead isn't doing its own thing. For example, even though the game's essentially a rapid-fire action game, there's a little strategy in the design through the weapon system. Reloading actually takes a bit of time to perform -- to refill the gun, you need to drag the ammunition across from one side of the screen to the other. Not only does this action take more than a split second, there's also the added element that your on-screen persona has to perform the reload animation...which puts your shooting out of commission for as long as it takes. Finding the proper time to reload becomes absolutely integral to the gameplay, and it's a lot more involved than simply shooting off-screen like you would do in the SEGA light gun shooters.   On top of this, there's also the added element of weapon management -- you'll stumble upon additional guns deeper in the game that have limited ammunition, and you can switch to them on-the-fly with a press of the D-pad in the proper direction. Every so often you'll find weapon upgrades that'll increase the power and reload speed of that gun, so that adds a bit more technique to the game that makes it less of a mindless blast-a-thon.      It is just a light gun shooter without the light gun. But hey, it's actually fun. Challenging, too. The way this game's balanced there's no way you'll be able to blast through this game in an hour or two in the same way you might with a home port of an arcade shooter. The developer plotted out a design that insures you'll have a rough time getting through all the levels in a short amount of time. How? Limited checkpoints for one thing -- you're moving through the world with one life to live, and when you restart the level you're all the way back at the beginning of that chapter's segment...with the same amount of health you had when the game saved your position. If you only have a couple of notches of health left at the beginning of a chapter, you might be too screwed to continue in that way...which means you're probably best off restarting. Luckily, like pretty much any light gun production in existence, memorization will help since the on-rails path is set, which means all the boxes holding extra health and ammunition will always hold the extra health and ammunition in every play through. Admittedly, Touch the Dead can be challenging by being cheap -- like throwing so many zombies on screen so close to attacking range that it's pretty impossible to blast them away in time without taking damage. But it's not an impossible action game...it'll just take a few play throughs to get the job done.   Touch the Dead uses the Nintendo DS system's 3D capabilities for its visuals. Pretty? Not really -- the environments are rather sparse that lack detail, and textures are super low resolution in places. When the designers cut away to real-time cutscenes it's almost a wonder why they decided to bring the camera up close as frequently as they did. Sure it's dramatic, but man...those big fat pixels can be destractingly ugly. On the positive side, zombies can be blasted in the face, chest, belly, arms and legs and they'll show the appropriate damage...right down to the missing limbs and big gaping holes in their torso. But don't expect to be grossed out since you can only do so much with low resolution character models. The gang did a great job on the sound, though -- lots of high quality gun blasts and reload samples. Not much memorable in the way of a soundtrack, but it's not like a creepy game like this needs one.So Touch the Dead lacks any sort of originality, but it definitely has a place in the Nintendo DS line-up. It's a straight-forward, fun, intense action game that does a decent job of what it sets out to do...even if that's just to steal the House of the Dead idea before Sega decides to port it officially itself.", "date": "May 23, 2007"}
