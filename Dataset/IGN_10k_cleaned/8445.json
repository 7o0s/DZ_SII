There was Solomon's Key and Tecmo Bowl, and of course, the AAA title that hit in the late '80s and launched the company's most powerful brand, the original Ninja Gaiden. Sadly, there were also games on Tecmo's B-list.   B stands for Bomb Jack this time around. Rated at #14 on Seanbaby's list of the Worst Nintendo Games of All Time, Mighty Bomb Jack is the woeful result of a mid-'80s attempt at copycatting. The original Bomb Jack was an action/ puzzler -- an arcade game that tasked you to defuse big, red explosives as a caped superhero. This sequel, with ~Mighty~ added to the name, carried forward that same concept, but at the same time, tried to fuse it with the design direction of Super Mario Bros. The fusion didn't work. This hybrid, half Bomb Jack and half Mario, feels half-baked.           It's not quite as bad as Seanbaby would have you believe, but it's close. One of his primary complaints was Jack's jump control -- that's understandable, because Jack will reach for the sky with incredibly long and floaty leaps with even the slightest touch of the A Button. But if you press A again while Jack's in flight, his upward motion will be cancelled. Press A again, repeatedly, and he'll slowly glide back down to earth not unlike the function of Mario's Raccoon Suit in Super Mario Bros. 3.   Jumping and gliding are Jack's only abilities, though, as he's left without any method of offensive attack. The goal of each level is reaching the exit door, and you'll have to guide good Jack around and over enemies, never making contact, or Jack will die. Along the way you'll encounter treasure chests, most of them unlockable by jumping up and down on top of them, and most of them containing cash or power-ups for the hero. Getting powered up isn't all that impressive, though, as it really just means a palette swap for Jack and the added ability to do something like open chests from the side instead of jumping on them from above.   Further frustration enters in with the non-linearity of MBJ's level layout. The game takes place inside a labyrinthine pyramid, and there are various different paths to take in making forward progress; this method of advancement is novel, if done right, but just confusing when done here. The NES cartridge's original instruction manual advised making a hand-drawn map as you played. I'd just advise not to play in the first place.Mighty Bomb Jack is a poor candidate for your time investment, especially considering the other top-notch titles available in the same genre at the same price point. Stick with other Tecmo-produced games instead.", "date": "May 7, 2007"}
