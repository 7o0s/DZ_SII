{"name": "C&C Renegade", "name_review": "Command & Conquer Renegade", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/03/04/command-conquer-renegade", "text": "Let's skip the usual reminiscences; nearly every gamer in the world is familiar enough with the Command & Conquer series (or if they aren't, they ought to be). Let's just say that when Westwood announced they were translating the concepts and content of their premiere real-time strategy franchise into a first-person shooter. Throughout the course of development, we've kept a close eye on this one and have been among it's most ardent supporters, anticipating that the chance to take on the role of a single unit in a first-person view of an RTS world would be refreshing and original.  And while the end result is indeed an inventive and faithful interpretation of the C&C license, Renegade suffers somewhat from a few poor design decisions and embarrassing AI. There are some notable strengths here and definitely some innovative ideas but much of it is still a bit too unrefined to compete with the better action games (and some of the better RTS games) currently on the market.  The single player campaign is mostly enjoyable and makes excellent use of the franchise. In fact, the whole Command & Conquerishness of the title is its biggest draw and its best-implemented feature. The units, buildings and situations are all exactly right for the license. That's not too surprising given that Westwood's in charge of the project, but it's still commendable. A few of the old sounds have even been used to add that extra level of authenticity.  During the game you'll take on the role of Commando Nick ~Havoc~ Parker, the one-man army for GDI. GDI's interested in recovering information about the latest plans of Nod, a morally unambiguous terrorist group that's bent on world domination (the actual objectives during the mission are more specific, but not necessarily more clear). Each mission in your quest to uncover Nod's latest plot takes place in one immense level. At the start you may be standing on a landing spot on the beach, by the end you'll have traveled deep under the earth to the heart of a Nod base with nary a load.  The price we pay for the immense levels is reduced graphical detail. When we first saw the project (back when I was but a lowly cub reporter here at IGN), Renegade's graphics and lighting effects were spectacular. Sadly things don't seem to have improved much in terms of graphics -- Renegade still looks good, but it's a bit dated. While the character models are quite good, the environments are relatively blocky and the textures are flat. Lighting effects could be improved substantially and there are more than occasional clipping problems. At least a few of the glitches are good for some laughs. Like when it snows indoors, or when two helicopters pass through each other.   What did you think of C&C Renegade?  Beyond the somewhat flat graphics, the engine also seems to lack a sense of weight or momentum. There are some really impressive motion-captured animations in the game that tend to minimize the sort of empty feel that the models have. Death animations, runs and even little throwaway movements are really well done and contribute greatly to suspending your disbelief. Still, it can't keep you from noticing that the figures in the game lack substance.  This feeling carries over to the weapons. None of them actually feel substantial enough for you to buy into the world completely. Part of it is the sound. While the team took the classy route and used a lot of the sounds from the first C&C game, the weapon sounds are too weak. The weapons themselves are fairly generic, despite the thin veneer of C&C laid over them. The only real difference between the weapons seems to be in their rate of fire and their damage type. Apart from that, the weapons all seem unreasonably accurate and it was all too easy to take out sentries hundreds of yards away with a few bursts from my trusty chaingun.  Westwood changed their standard approach by relying exclusively on CG cutscenes using the game models. In the past, Westwood's been known for their astonishingly well-produced cutscenes that are as professional as anything else that's being done in gaming. This time, the scenes are all run in the game engine and, while the characters look a little uncomfortable and slightly freakish, look amazing. Good use is made of a handheld camera effect that keeps the cutscene looking dynamic.  A few of the other general presentation items deserve to be noted. The Westwood install program has always been a treat and Renegade is no exception. I'm a little puzzled by the fact that you've got to put the Game disc in to start the game but have to put the Data disc in to play. And since you can't start using the game disc...whatever. Also, the game comes in the new smaller box which is always a big plus for me. Not much in terms of boosting the score but convenient nevertheless.  More than just about anything else it's the dreadful AI that ruins the potential enjoyment of the game. Enemies possess very little sophistication and their main tactic seems to consist of running right towards you trying to empty their ammo clips as fast as possible. This can be especially funny when they're running at you in a straight line and the guy at the back kills as many enemies as you do. There have been more than a few situations where enemies didn't notice me even when they should have -- like when I've run in circles around them or shot the crap out of the guy standing next to them in the cafeteria.  It also seems like the vehicles are far too passive. You can safely peek out from around the corner of a building and blast away at an exposed corner of an enemy vehicle. As long as the turret can't see you, the vehicle just sits quietly and waits to be blown up. Pathfinding is a bit of a problem as well as we've seen quite a few buggies trying to drive straight through walls.  Still, the vehicles are an excellent addition and well integrated into the game. Getting the chance to jump in a Nod buggy and scoot around the levels is pretty awesome. Once you've had the chance to drive around a bit, you'll really appreciate the fact that Westwood made these vehicles so unique while keeping them authentic to the standard C&C setup. Mammoth tanks do lots of damage but are horribly slow while stealth tanks are nimble and able to ~hide~ from their enemies. APCs let you carry infantry deep into enemy territory while mobile artillery lets you take out buildings from afar.  The only other real downside to the vehicles is that there's not enough room in the levels to fully enjoy them. In keeping with the shape of the rest of the game, the vehicle sequences all take place in narrow environments where you can't really take advantage of the movement. This drains the tactical opportunities of vehicles of nearly all of their sophistication. Instead of using a captured Nod buggy to sneak around the back of an enemy base or heading to the tiberium fields to take out enemy harvesters, you'll spend almost all of your time hopping out of your tank, checking around the corner for enemy vehicles of rocket soldiers, then hopping back in the tank driving to the next bend in the road, then hopping out again.      This is a problem with the overall level design. Things are much too constricted and narrow for you to really feel like you have much choice. While there are a few branches along the paths (and a handful of wide-open areas), most of the levels consist of running down a long tunnel/hallway/street/valley/whatever until you get to the end of the level. Along the way there will be ample opportunity to enter the various buildings and rummage around inside. Making the levels a bit more open and offering more approaches to key objectives would go a long way towards making it more intelligent (and consequently reducing the player base). Larger, more open environments would also finally give us a chance to take advantage of an otherwise impossible stealth-oriented approach.  There's quite a bit of scripting in the game, most of which is pretty good. The story is engaging (although some of the audio cues tend to pile up while you're trying to pay attention). As I said at the start, the Commando's job is primarily rescuing people from Nod. Along the way you'll blow up stuff, steal data and get involved in some seriously large battles. The scripting's a little less apparent in the larger battles and, as a result, it's much more effective. It's a bit of a paradox that the Commando works primarily as a loner while the game's best sequences are those in which he's merely part of a much larger force.  Consequently the real gem of the title would have to be multiplay and C&C Mode is where the whole promise of the game finally appears to be fulfilled. Taking on a role in a GDI versus Nod base assault is really inventive and quite a lot of fun. A class-based character system, a full set of vehicles and the traditional C&C base structures all contribute greatly to your immersion in the game world. Quick respawns and the chance for heroic, individual action let you take as large a role as skill and luck will allow.  But even here there are some real snags. Although we haven't experienced anything blatantly frustrating with the code, quite a few players have experienced serious lag, even on fast connections. Further, the lack of any grand strategic overview weights the gameplay even more towards individual action. There's a difference between being part of a group and just having the same goals as the other people on your team. A more convenient set of team commands or a strategic map might have helped here. LAN games are definitely a blast if you can talk to the people you're playing with.  An offline practice mode is included but the AI there is even less effective than it is in the regular single-player portion of the game. If nothing else, it'll give you a chance to get used to how hard it is to kill an opponent in multiplay. The weapons that seemed so effective against your enemies in the single-player game will seem pretty feeble in mutliplay. But, hey, since everyone has to use them I guess it's okay.  With a lot more stability (and some slight balancing) through future patches, the C&C Mode of Renegade could well be the reason to try the game out. It's certainly a novel enough idea that seems like a perfect mix of the three big genres -- online, action and strategy. Hopefully the next few evolutions of the idea will bring it closer the refinement that it needs to compete with the games in the individual categories. Westwood's been careful to position this game so that it doesn't openly compete with the other first-person shooters on the market and to be fair, the game does have a different take on the whole genre that sets it apart. The trouble is, that many of those other games are much more enjoyable than Renegade for the first-person shooter fans that are likely to be interested in the game. The novelty of the Command & Conquer mechanic is definitely enough to hold your interest but the overall production is what, ultimately, keeps the title from attaining the success we all thought it ought to have.I guess I wanted something a lot less scripted and a lot less cramped from the single player game. The chance to jump into the middle of a battle between GDI and Nod would be made more attractive by the inclusion of large open levels like those in Ghost Recon or Operation Flashpoint. As it is, it's a lot like running through a hall until you get to a building, clearing the building and then running through a hallway until you get to the next building.I wanted to like Renegade more than I eventually did. The challenge in it comes not from its sophistication but from brute force and weight of numbers. In the end, it's not quite smart enough to really deliver the grunt's-eye-view of the RTS that it should have been. It's a departure for Westwood and only a moderately successful one. Still, with another title or two in this same genre, Westwood may finally be able to refine the concepts of  Renegade into something much more enjoyable than the current game.", "date": "Mar 4, 2002"}
