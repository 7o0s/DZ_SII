Today we're going to break from the usual to put out this impassioned plea to the industry.  Please, stop dumping your PSX and N64 garbage onto the Dreamcast.  We appreciate the support, but this isn't the way to do it.  Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000, while enjoying no competition in it's genre on the Dreamcast, fails to please in any category whatsoever.   As you can tell, I don't have nice things to say about this title.  The concept of the game is noble enough.  Its goal was to reproduce the excitement of motocross racing, with indoor and outdoor tracks (some of which are actually licensed), exciting stunts, and a wide variety of real racers including the man himself, Jeremy McGrath.  You can customize your racer, and there's even a track editor.  It all sounds good enough.  Unfortunately this game, like many before it, proudly displays the difference between a good idea on paper, and a good idea in execution.    This game is long on features.  Aside from the standard exhibition style race where you pick a track, a racer, and go and the equally standard time trial mode, there are a few more interesting modes of play.  The best (and in this game that's a very loose term) mode of play is the series mode, where you pick a racer and try to finish first in a series of races.  Your overall rank is kept track of, and doing well here will unlock progressively more difficult (another loose term) racing series.  In between races, you can adjust your power, suspension, and tires as well as choosing between auto and manual transmission.  Most of these adjustments are largely in vain, but we'll get to that more later.  The other mode of note is the freestyle mode that allows you to participate in a stunt competition in special arenas sparsely populated with ramps and other jumps.   Sadly, no matter how many different ways you serve up garbage, it's still garbage.  Rather than try to hit the tricky balancing act involved in making a good physics engine for a motocross game, Acclaim has chosen to not include any real physics at all.  The bikes can turn on a dime at any speed, screech to a halt then hit top speed in one swift motion, and even careen off invisible walls with no effect whatsoever.  The optional weather settings seem to have no bearing on the way the bike controls at all.  Basically you are just racing with some cheap raindrop effects.  No sliding in the mud or anything like that.  The whole thing reeks of laziness.  The stunts are kind of fun to pull off, but they have no use in the standard racing, so you are left to enjoy those in the freestyle mode.   Don't count on your fellow racers to add some thrills into the mix.  They are so incredibly bad that you can wipe out several times, go backwards for most of the first lap, turn around, and still nearly lap someone by the end of the race.  Most of the time in this game you will be way out in front with no challenge to your lead in sight.  Bumping up the difficulty level does little to alleviate this.    Graphically, this game is no pretty penny either.  The textures seem to be directly from the N64 version, which means they are nowhere near Dreamcast specs.  Granted, they upped the resolution, but that's hardly worthy of any sort of accolade.  Worst of all, the framerate just sucks.  It coughs up and down like there's no tomorrow, depending on the track complexity and how many people are playing.  If you are attempting to play the two player split screen with CPU racers, the framerate stays at a steady, low number that ensures minimal enjoyment.  The animation on the racers is just as week.  In the sport of motocross, there is a lot of great body movement involved, mostly because the body position has such a huge bearing on what the bike is doing.  In this game, the only time your racer budges is when he's fully into a turn, when he's doing a stunt, or when he finishes a race.  As I mentioned before, the weather effects are just cosmetic, and they don't look that great.  Even more disappointing are the ~time of day~ effects.  This only changes the horizon background while you race from yellow, to blue, to red.  There are no special lighting effects involved or anything.  This game would be considered to have miserable visuals even if it looked like this on N64.    The sound and music are the only place this game isn't below average.  The soundtrack is decent, with some Offspring music, and the sound effects are reasonable enough, with some decent engine noises and a very unobtrusive announcer.  Jeremy McGrath even cuts in with his voice at the track select screen and offers up some tips on the course.  Not greatly helpful given his tips are meant for someone with reasonable control of his vehicle, but still a nice touch.    Other nice touches are the rider customization and track editor.  Although the rider customization is limited to picking a name, number, rider color, and bike, it's still pretty neat.  It would be a lot better if you could choose from more colors or details, or you know, if the game played better, but what can you do?  The track editor, although fairly utilitarian, is a nice bonus.  You can only make indoor tracks, and can't really play around with the height of the ground save for adding ramps and bumps, nor can you get any variety in your textures.  Nonetheless, if you happen to get stuck with this game, it's at least something.    Even without any immediate choice in motocross games, you should still pass over Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000.  We Dreamcast owners aren't bad people.  We don't deserve these kinds of quick ports of underselling low quality games.  I can't really recommend this game to anyone in good faith, even fans jonesing for any motocross game.  Stay away.  Jeremy McGrath Supercross 2000 bad.  That is all.   -- Shaun Musgrave, IGNDCJeremy McGrath endorsed the game, did motion-captured animations, and helped with the design.  What's that mean?  Absolutely nothin'.  This is yet another bad port of a Nintendo 64 game, despite that the Nintendo 64 version shouldn't have been made in the first place.  Why bother bringing a game like this to the PlayStation when there's no vast improvements on its gameplay?  Acclaim, I know you guys can do better than this.  Knock off the crap and get to work on something worth playing, already!", "date": "Aug 19, 2000"}
