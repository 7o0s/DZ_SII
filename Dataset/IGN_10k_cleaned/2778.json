The game admittedly wasn't all that hot, but the development team went ahead and utilized that overhead game engine for another racing title, this time for Infogrames' NASCAR Heat 2002 license. And like Driven before it, this game design has a lot of potential, marred mostly by the seriously flawed game engine that limits most of the necessities of racing. Features Six gameplay modes 12 tracks 24 licensed racers Link cable support for four player racing (single and multiple cartridge support)  NASCAR Heat 2002 is not really a simulation of the sport of NASCAR racing...it definitely focuses more on the action, even in the career mode. The only simulation aspects are in the pitstops, where extensive races require players to bring their car in to replace worn tires, repair any damage to their vehicles, and to gas up their fuel tank. It doesn't go as far as determining gas weight to speed...but the longer you spend filling your tank is precious time off the clock.  This racing game's main problem is its visibility...the isometric viewpoint is way too close to the action and the tracks are so wide that it's incredibly difficult to anticipate the turns. You literally have to go into them blind, only knowing they're coming up by practicing that track. There's no way you'd be able to successfully win a race on an unfamiliar track the first time around based on pure driving skill...you're just never given enough heads-up where the tracks going. You don't even get an on-screen map. This viewpoint also hurts driving strategy, since you don't know how far the opposition is from your position on the track until they show up on-screen.   The game's collision detection is a real drag, too.  NASCAR Heat encourages ~drafting,~ a technique where you slip your car right behind another, using the lower air pressure to get a boost of speed...but the collision block around the vehicle extends at least five pixels from his rear bumper. So you'll gain a bit of speed, and ram into, well, nothing, which slows your vehicle down...or worse, have it careen out of control. NASCAR Heat 2002's game engine isn't that advanced either, and it has the same problems that Driven had...including a low framerate that doesn't offer a good sense of speed, and its control is a little on the sluggish side. The game doesn't self-center the vehicles as badly as Driven did, though, so a little more skill is involved in getting around the turns and weaving through the traffic...but then, the poor collision detection really hurts that strategy, too.  Crawfish gives the game a lot of variety in its game modes, especially in its Beat the Heat mode where you have to perform specific tasks handed to you in order to move on. But all of these modes are still hindered by the game's poor visibility and collision detection. And though the game supports single cartridge multiplayer, it doesn't give players a lay of the track ahead of time, so it's a blind race for those not familiar with what the game uploads to the other systems. If the game had better visibility, a higher framerate, and tighter controls, NASCAR Heat would be a decent racer on the Game Boy Advance. NASCAR Heat has a good game structure, including many of the items necessary for a successful racer, but when you can't see the coming turns, the approaching competition, and when it's difficult to take a sharp turn because of sluggish controls, it's difficult to enjoy the game.", "date": "Jun 28, 2002"}
