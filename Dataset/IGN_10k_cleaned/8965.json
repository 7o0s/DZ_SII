When everyone else is busy making the world prettier, bigger, and fatter, developers like Team 17 know that we gamers just want a good product. And why not? We deserve it. Worms Armageddon is a special summer present for those of us that just can't handle that S-U-N, or any more horrible Jell-O salads with carrots and raisins.  Call this what you will -- Armageddon isn't exactly a full-fledged sequel, but it's definitely more than an add-on pack. Most of the changes are cosmetic, but fans of the series will be happy to know that new weapons have been added, as well as some key additions to the multiplayer levels. More importantly, it's more worms dying in more intricate and pleasurable ways. Since a lot of you have played the series for years now, I've broken this review into two different sections to better save you time and energy (actually, I value your time, but not your energy):  Newbies As you probably know, worms are an inherently violent and grotesque species, who routinely pummel each other for the sheer sadomasochistic pleasure. The Worms Armageddon team has observed worms in their natural environment for the last 44 years in order to create a painstakingly realistic representation of their lives. Take control of worms in a 2D environment, in a game that feels like the best parts of Lemmings and old cannon games like Artillery. Your job: to eradicate the enemy worms on a single playfield using a huge array of bizarre weapons such as sheep, homing missiles, old women, and bananas. Most of Armageddon's skill (and fun) focuses on trying to find the right trajectory and force with which to lob your ammo at the enemy. Some weapons are unaffected by the wind, but other weapons (such as the powerful bazooka) can turn against you if you aren't careful about how you launch them. Add to that wild gadgets, gizmos, crazy animations and voices, and you've got yourself a fun, addictive game.  Worm Veterans OK, so this isn't exactly a real sequel per se, but the additions are worth spending the paper for. First and foremost, let's talk weapons. The new aqua sheep can do some deft underwater traveling, which is perfect for a little cross-country attack on those hard to reach enemies. Indian Nuclear Tests not only slam your enemies with powerful radiation, but cause huge earthquakes guaranteed to take out anyone near an edge (that includes you).  Flame throwers are fun because... basically we all like fire, and especially worms on fire. Armageddon also adds to the huge library of voices and options, and adds a few additions to the crate drop library.  The designers have worked hard to make full missions a more complete experience, but along with it the skill level has taken a big leap forward. If the last games in the series felt a bit too easy, n Armageddon plays like a limbless version of Full Metal Jacket. Expect to take on a mission at least three or four times before you conquer it (Mr. Robot: or perhaps you should just try playing a little smarter instead of screaming and spinning around on your chair every time you lob a grenade). The mini games are a nice touch, especially the warped ~Euthanasia~ level which has you taking target practice on old women, and ~Sheep Racing,~ which gives you ample time to test out your super sheep steering skills.  Extra voices and mini games are a nice addition, but anyone that's played the Worms series knows that multiplayer is what really makes it so special. The team touts that there are billions of different variations you can create while setting up a multiplayer battle, and once you start tweaking you'll realize how right they really are. Armageddon allows you to set up a deathmatch against computer opponents as well, which is perfect for practicing your skills before taking on the worms at large. More importantly, what the Armageddon has harnessed into a deadly weapon is the simple joy of playing the game. No matter how frustrating a level becomes, or how bad your troops are being squished, you can't help but keep coming back for more. It's a delicious addiction, and much more reasonable than most addictions currently on the (black) market. While playing Mr. Robot, I was amazed at the tension that you find yourself in while waiting to be pummeled, especially when the enemy calls out a napalm strike and you have no choice but to watch it explode your segmented pals into oblivion. Mr. Robot liked doing that a lot, actually.  In the end you'll find yourself thinking that this is still Worms, and though the additions are fantastic, it really doesn't feel like a full-fledged step in the series. Instead it's a nice little hop forward, but enough of one to start pressing those love buttons in your brain just like old times. For new players, this is a fantastic place to start -- as long as you realize that you're going to go through quite a bit of frustration before you learn to figure out the intricacies of sheep combat and bazooka hurling in hurricanes. For the rest of us, it's a perfect family reunion.  -- Vincent Lopez   What Vincent forgot to add, however, was the incredible list of weapons available to you as a little wormie, because Vincent is lazy and surly. You want action? How about: Air Strike Banana Bomb Baseball Bat Battle Axe Bazooka Blowtorch Bridge Kit Bungee Carpet Bomb Cluster Bomb Dragon Ball Dynamite Earthquake Fire Punch Flame Thrower French Sheep Strike Freeze Girder Grenade Handgun Holy Hand Grenade Homing Missile Homing Pigeon Indian Nuclear Test Kamikaze Land Mine Longbow Mini Gun Mad Cow Magic Bullet Mail Strike MB Bomb Mine Strike Ming Vase Mole Bomb Mole Squadron Mortar Napalm Strike Ninja Rope Old Woman Parachute Petrol Bomb Pnuematic Drill Prod Sally Army Scales of Justic Select Worm Sheep Sheep Launcher Shotgun Surrender Skip Go Suicide Bomber Super Banana Bomb Super Sheep Teleport... and Uzi. Is that enough for you? Huh? Huh?  Plus, he forgot to say that worms are cute. They are. And they taste delicious.  -- Mr. Robot", "date": "Jul 2, 1999"}
