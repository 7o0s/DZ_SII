Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar joins a growing (but exclusive) list of awesome expansions that we've seen over the last year or so. Where most expansions are simply mission packs designed to ~extend~ the game experience for hardcore fans, Dark Avatar is an expansion in the truest sense of the word, bringing loads of new features that take the core game experience into new and exciting directions.  (Though the new expansion pack includes all the content from Dread Lords, this review will focus on the new additions. The high level of polish, balance and overall design have been preserved. You can check out our full review of Dread Lords here.)   The new expansion adds so much that it's hard to know just where to begin. New civ options, more complex star systems, new espionage elements and improved diplomacy, an entirely new campaign, better graphics, and a number of other improvements make Dark Avatar a sure bet for fans of space strategy games.  Perhaps the most significant and satisfying gameplay change is the inclusion of environmental restrictions for colonization. In Dread Lords we, like many players, preferred to grab as many habitable planets as possible before worrying too much about things like infrastructure or technology or warships. Sure, it sometimes left you open for a massive attack, but it was the surest way to establish a solid foundation for the middle game.  This time around many of the planets are off-limits until you've researched the technology required to colonize them. And since there are different technologies for different environmental hazards, you'll really have to choose carefully. These technologies are also relatively expensive as well, so any effort you put into researching them is going to mean you're neglecting something else. In all it's an excellent way to kind of put a check on the colony rush that most players have been using.   There's also an added sense of terrain in space now, courtesy of the new asteroid fields. While the various resources scattered around the galaxy helped to provide some interesting focal points, the new asteroid fields are an entirely new substantial resource that you and your enemies will fight over. If you have facilities on an asteroid, you can divert resources to a nearby planet, vastly enhancing its productivity. Because the asteroids are rarely as well protected as planets, they make excellent targets for hit and run strikes and provide a nice objective for players who want to stick it to their enemy but aren't quite ready for the planetary assaults.  Espionage is another big change for the series and another weapon in your quest for dominance. Though it's not a game winner by itself, the careful and concentrated use of espionage can really make a huge difference, both in terms of giving you extra information about your enemy and in shutting down their key planetary improvements. You generate spies by increasing your espionage spending on your domestic screen. Paralleling the warlord units in Civ IV: Warlords, each new spy costs more money to recruit making each spy more valuable than the last.  Once recruited, you can station an enemy spy on any planet you've discovered. They shut down whatever improvement you've placed them on and start gathering information about your opponent's overall condition. They can only be countered by another spy so, even if you don't want to engage in the espionage game, you'll have to have a few spies ready to fend off your enemies.      On the downside, ground combat is still a bit flat. (Haha!) Though there are some interesting research paths you can explore to improve your assaults and some ethical decisions with regard to bombardment, invading another civilization's planet is largely a spectator sport. You'll basically just watch the troop numbers until you know who still has soldiers left on the ground.  The technology system is also still uninspired. It's great that each branch of knowledge is separate from the others; there's none of Civilization's sometimes arbitrary ~you need to know Masonry to know Monotheism~ prerequisites. But there's not much inventiveness or personality here either. Sure, Dark Avatar bundles Phasers I - VII in a single box on the tech list now, but it hardly feels like a dynamic progression from one interesting technology to the next. They're still too isolated from each other and still too generic in our opinion.   The new campaign picks up at the end of the previous game and, honestly, things have gone so bad for the humans that they're not the featured attraction here. This time around the story sees the player taking sides in a Drengin civil war. One side wants to exterminate all life in the galaxy, while the other side simply wants to enslave them. You play the part of the slightly less evil Drengin (the ones who only want to enslave the galaxy) and find yourself fighting against the more bloodthirsty types and their planet-killing spore ship.  In all, it's a pretty exciting campaign. Though it starts off in a fairly predictable manner, it soon develops into a rather complex story. You will have to build alliances with races that pretty much know you're going to enslave them once the common enemy is defeated. Some of the particularly interesting missions have you sneaking across the galaxy avoiding fights or using the game's new espionage system to discover just what your enemies are up to. Fans of the Dread Lords will be happy to know that they're not entirely absent from this campaign either. Unlike the previous game's campaign, the fact that you start from scratch with each new mission makes a little more sense here.   Terrifyingly, the expansion also includes an option to let the AI use the full power of your PC to shape its strategies. While it's a nice touch, sure to please the hardest of the hardcore crowd, we can't really tell a difference between the AI that really kicks our ass and one that really, really kicks it. Really. Those of you who have been finding the ~tough~ or ~painful~ settings a bit too easy will likely appreciate this new feature more than most.   As enjoyable as the campaign is, the real meat of the game is the open-ended dynamic campaign. Here you'll square off against a number of other civilizations in a race to achieve military, economic, diplomatic and technological superiority. This time around you're not limited to playing as the humans either (unless you've chosen a particular scenario, that is). You can now try your hand at leading all the other civilizations or even creating an entirely new one from scratch.  The new civs and the civ creation tool add a lot of replayability to the game.  Picking your new race's abilities, weaknesses, government, overall aesthetic and so forth really lets you tailor the experience to your own tastes. Better still, you can design your opponents as well, setting up whatever galactic civilization you want. If you'd like to have a three-way fight between financial powerhouses, you can do that. If you'd like to populate the galaxy with peaceful science types and then drop two militaristic civs into the mix, you can do that as well.      In addition there are options now to design custom ships for your new races. If you've got the skills and the inclination, there's no reason you can't have the Battlestar Galactica racing to intercept a Vogon Constructor Fleet as it passes by the impoverished Gungan homeworld. Along with the improvements in the graphics area comes new parts for the ship designer. We're not neurotic enough to have actually noticed the new parts but, trust us, there are more components here than you'll ever need.  The art team has done a really great job with the ships this time around. While the ships in Dread Lords were perfectly acceptable, those in Dark Avatar have more complex geometries and much better textures that allow for a much better sense of detail and depth. The large ships and stations are particularly worth taking a close look at. Weapon effects, explosions and so forth have also been improved but they're not quite as big a leap forward as the ship models are.   Planets and stars are still very well rendered but begin to get a bit muddy when you zoom in too closely. The new asteroid graphics add a bit of variety to the visuals as well and fit the overall style of the game quite nicely. Unfortunately, they, like many of the anomalies, are black against a black backdrop, which makes it a bit harder to appreciate how nice they look.  Finally, though we'd heard rumors that the foundation for multiplayer does exist somewhere in the game, Dark Avatar is still a solo affair, Metaverse notwithstanding. While it would be a welcome feature, the developer claims that the proportion of the game's fans who really want multiplayer isn't large enough to justify its inclusion in Dark Avatar.Dread Lords was great and Dark Avatar is even better. The new additions enlarge the experience considerably, even if they don't exactly change the overall purpose or personality of the game. The inclusion of tech-prerequisites for colonization of certain environments is probably the most significant change here but there are plenty of other new features here that force the player into new and interesting situations. That you get some ample improvements in graphics and AI is just icing on the cake.", "date": "Feb 12, 2007"}
