The hugely popular toy franchise enabled us, as kids, to race the souped-up automobiles of our dreams in miniature form around loop-the-loop tracks with corkscrew turns and a never-ending sense of speed. And as adults, the toys have lived on as collector's items. Now, Electronic Arts and developer Stormfront Studios (Nascar 2000), have teamed up to bring the Hot Wheels license to Nintendo 64 as a 3D racing game. Featuring more than 40 Hot Wheels classics, a wide selection of tracks and a simplistic, but fun stunt system to boot, Hot Wheels Turbo Racing is the perfect title for gamers who are more interested in catching big air and spinning around than they are coming in first.  The Facts  More than 40 of the classic, favorite Hot Wheels cars including the time-honored Twin Mill, Red Baron, Mongoose, JetThreat and Cat-A-Pult. Experience eight classic Hot Wheels stunt tracks including the Loop-the-loop, Criss-cross and Danger Changer.  Unique stunt mechanic that lets players execute wild mid-air spins, 360s and sensational end-over flips. Multiple gameplay modes include Exhibition, Airtime challenge, Hot Wheels Cup, Practice and more. Three ways to win -- speed, stunts and crashing cars off the road. Shortcuts, hidden cars, powerups and more.    Soundtrack includes the music of Mix Master Mike, Primus, Reverend Horton Heat and more. Two-player race mode. Rumble and Memory Pak support.   Gameplay After only minutes of play with Electronic Arts' Hot Wheels Turbo Racing, it becomes plainly evident that the game has been inspired, at least in part, by Midway's popular Rush franchise. Both titles dismiss simulation-esque racing mechanics in favor of light-hearted stunts, gravity-defying jumps and tracks that cater to both. However, Hot Wheels takes the spirit of the Rush series one step further by completely abolishing any sense of realism. Using its license to the fullest, Stormfront Studios' racer unfolds on colorful, plastic-like tracks that bend in virtually every direction, corkscrew at every other turn, loop-the-loop on a regular basis, and spit out jumps more often than Jay Leno spits out bad jokes. The idea behind Hot Wheels Turbo Racing is not to strategically power-slide around corners and blow past opponents, but rather to flip over them, spin by them or, if needs be, knock them off the road and keep moving.  An emphasis has been placed on the game's simplistic stunt system. Unlike the Rush franchise, where a player has virtually no control of their vehicle once it is sent airborne, Hot Wheels Turbo Racing enables the complete manipulation of cars in mid-flight. Racers can spin their vehicles sideways, flip them over, corkscrew them, or pull off a variation of all three  all while soaring through the air. The trick system takes a bit of getting used to and isn't very deep. The analog stick is used to spin cars right or left while in the air. Depending on how hard the stick is pressed in either direction, a car will spin fast or slow. Pressing forward or backward on the stick, meanwhile, flips cars forward or backward. Finally, holding the R button down in combination with the analog stick works to spin cars in a corkscrew, diagonal fashion. Control is very tight. Those accustomed to the loose, heavy feel of cars in the Rush franchise will be sorely disappointed to learn that nearly every one of Hot Wheels' 40+ vehicles feels just the opposite; they're all super light to the point where they seem nearly weightless.   An equally simplistic, but nonetheless effective point system has been implemented for added strategy. All of the cars in the game utilize nitro boosts for added speed. Boosting before a ramp or jump results in higher hang time, which in turn offers players more freedom in the air to execute bigger tricks. If a trick is pulled off successfully, a nitro boost is awarded to the player. The bigger the trick, the more nitro boosts are received. So, the idea is to execute the biggest jumps, land them correctly and gather as many extra nitro boosts as possible. The more boosts, the better, as they can and will need to be utilized in order to blow past opponents and win races.  Ironically, the Hot Wheels license and the track design therein may have actually worked to hinder the overall freedom of the game. In spite of the great many tricks and stunts available, players are still limited to a relatively straight-forward experience. Whereas the races in San Francisco Rush, for example, can lead in virtually any direction, the vehicles soar over hilltops, skyscrapers and through giant city streets, Hot Wheels offers a much more confined stunting environment. While roads do branch in different directions, it's almost impossible to leave the comfort zone of the immediate area; there is never a feeling of wide-open, go-anywhere, do-anything racing and this is a real shame considering the broad range of tricks that can be executed.   The title features a two-player split-screen racing mode that plays just as well as the single-player game. While it's somewhat disappointing that developer Stormfront Studios didn't op to implement a four-player split-screen mode instead, the game's two-player race, in its defense, features a consistently fast sense of speed and only marginal differences in overall fluidity. We've got no complaints.  Graphics Stormfront Studios has successfully translated the look of Hot Wheels plastic tracks into the world of polygons. Hot Wheels Turbo Racing features roads that glow bright red, stripe yellow and orange, green, blue  everything but black, really. While these tracks are most definitely reminiscent of the toy courses they were inspired by, as a game we must admit that they still come off looking overly tacky and far too bright in appearance. With that said, there are enough distractions in each level to avert our eyes for brief periods of time, such as rolling boulders, path splits, lightning bolts  all of the usual racing stuff. Because background graphics are of a much more realistic tone, the end effect is certainly unique, if not confusing. We end up with rainbow roads stretching through realistic environments. A bit odd to be sure, but it works. Vehicles, meanwhile, which are comprised of the classic Hot Wheels collection, come to life with solid polygon models and detailed textures.   The colorful environments themselves, it must be said, are not overly detailed. The entire game has a very polygon look about it, meaning roads and background objects have a blocky appearance about them. While a cut in environmental detail no doubt works to improve upon framerate, which we're always happy about, the title still comes away looking a bit dated when compared to some of the competition's offerings.  Sound In an off-the-wall move, Electronic Arts has licensed an odd combination of musical talent for this Hot Wheels based racer including Reverent Horton Heat, Primus and Mix Master Mike. Not exactly the type of bands you might associate with racing classic kids Hot Wheels miniatures, but hey  who are we to complain? Regardless, the music is compressed, but we still get the gist of it and overall it's not too shabby. On the sound effects side, we've got the standard mix of noises in relation to crashing, landing, nitro boosting, scraping walls  you name it. An in-game announcer proudly congratulates players when they land particularly special tricks as well, which works as a nice audio touch. Hot Wheels Turbo Racing is a good take on the popular toy license for Nintendo 64 owners. The game features a ton of classic vehicles, a simplistic stunt system that does the ~trick~ (but lacks depth) and lots of well-designed 3D tracks and environments. The title's visual appearance, an odd mix of bright, cheery roads and realistic backgrounds, may turn some gamers away in spite of the fact that it really does capture the look of Hot Wheels plastic tracks. Considering all of the above, though, I still prefer the wide-open, go-anywhere racing environments and heavy car physics of the Rush series to Hot Wheels' seemingly weightless cars and sometimes confined 3D tracks. With that said, the title comes recommended as a good racer that's going to appeal to stunt-lovers and not simulation junkies.", "date": "Oct 16, 1999"}
