Combining some mildly interesting, yet highly recycled, platforming with light adventure elements provides a tolerable diversion for fans of the series, but it's nothing to get excited about. And for those who have no clue about what this squishy yellow fellow is all about there's no reason to pick this up. Spend that cash on a few of the DVDs instead.  The world here is split up into nine separate areas and you'll be sure to become overly familiar with them. There's Rock Bottom, the residential district, the restaurant district, and others that are filled with plenty of things to jump over or onto. In the beginning of the game, SpongeBob makes a little mistake and causes evil red bubbles to attack the population.    This means that citizens are running back and forth with red bubbles flying about their heads. Jumping on them knocks off the bubbles, but if they hit you you'll lose a bit of life in the process. Even better, these citizens will all be back if you leave an area and come back to it. So expect to be jumping on heads by the hundreds.  Aside from the fleeing citizens there are plenty of floating bottles, moving platforms, and conveyor belts to jump on. If the levels were linear and you went through the game once these would be a fun challenge, but there's lots and lots and lots of backtracking involved and much of it can't be skipped. Getting across a spike-bottomed chasm by timing the jumps right is a fun challenge, but when you get to the end and a character tells you that you need to get her gym bag from her house it's a total chore. That involves going back across the platforming areas, getting the bag on another quest, and going back over the area a third time.  This constant travel is typical since most of the quests in the game require SpongeBob to go and get something and bring it back. The only challenge is in figuring out where the item is since the game rarely gives many clues. Fans of the show will have an idea of where someone's house or job is, but anyone else will need to find the information online or rely on brute force of exploring everywhere twice.  To make the nine locations spread farther they change as the game progresses and it's up to the player to keep exploring them constantly. Squishy plants that act as trampolines will appear near walls and blocked off areas will be open, but since there's no clue as to when this happens it's up to SpongeBob to keep going back, across the same platforming areas, to double-, triple-, quadruple-check and maybe go back again just to be sure.  A few of the new areas are opened up by super powers that SpongeBob picks up along the way and these are the most interesting parts of the whole game. Since each power is started on a special pad on the ground and have a short time limit it can be a fun task to figure out just what to do and race to get it done. But these challenges aren't done nearly enough and easily get drowned out by the backtracking that fills up the rest of the game. Way too much of the time SpongeBob is the universal errand boy and most of the game is running back and forth to find every knickknack and doodad that others have lost. The world of SpongeBob has been ported to the PSP well graphically, but the action that takes place inside of it is only decent for the hardcore fans who want their SpongeBob fix no matter what. The platforming and the special powers and the occasional boss fight all help to liven up the world, but the large majority of it is tedious and highly repetitive. Any trip to Bikini Bottom should be far more fun than this.", "date": "Mar 25, 2006"}
