Whether it will spread the game outside its small cult following, however, is another matter entirely.  It's a more accessible game than its predecessors, which stood as a perfect representation of From Software's anachronistic tendencies, but probably not to a degree that will convince anyone who grew frustrated with the digital controls and stiff difficulty curve of those games.   From appears committed to a steady evolution of its series, rather than genuinely shaking things up with each sequel.  Which is entirely the developer's prerogative, but it also makes it more and more likely that each successive Armored Core will only be bought by the followers of its predecessor.  In other words, if the franchise refuses to grow, its fan base isn't likely to grow an awful lot either.   Changing this game could drive off as many fans as it drew, though, so I suppose I can understand the conservative philosophy at work.  If the game does well enough to keep its creators happy, then better the digital you know than the Dual Shock you don't.   Boy, that was awful.   Gameplay  Armored Core 3 is, as these games always have been, a third-person-perspective presentation of solo humanoid robot combat.  Players take on the role of Ravens, mercenaries contracted by powerful corporations to accomplish various tasks, usually requiring the judicious application of extreme violence.  The money thus earned can be spent on a vast array of different robot parts, allowing Ravens to tweak an existing Core or build a new specialized model from the ground up.   The main additions to this sequel are in those key areas of construction and customization.  Weight limits are relaxed, allowing for more latitude in designing a Core's loadout -- you can pack extra equipment onto the frame at a small penalty in maneuverability.  And along with all the new parts added to existing categories, there's an entirely new part type, called ~Exceed Orbit.~  These are essentially the ~funnels~ from Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, little weapons or support devices that hover around the Core.   The addition of AI wingmates to the game is of somewhat mixed usefulness.  It's another factor that has to be carefully weighed in view of the mission at hand, just like designing your Core.  Early in the game, wingmen tend to take too big a bite out of a mission's eventual payoff, while later on, as missions grow more difficult and specialized, it takes effort and forethought to make the expense of a partner worth the money.  In the right situation, though, they're a substantial addition to the complexity of gameplay and potential success in a mission.   Amateur mecha mechanics, then, should be perfectly happy with the new toybox they've received.  Those more interested in the piloting experience, however, may remain somewhat disappointed with the controls on offer, particularly if they didn't cotton to the scheme featured in earlier Armored Cores.  It's changed, yes, but for most recalcitrants, it probably hasn't changed enough.   AC3, like the last expansion Another Age, features analog control, you see, but not dual analog control.  The left analog stick controls movement on the Y-axis (forward and back) and sight on the X-axis (left and right), but the shoulder buttons still control movement on the X-axis (strafing) and sight on the Z-axis (pitch).  In other words, the main problems with AC2 aren't solved.  It's still more difficult to target flying enemies than it ought to be, and movement on the ground remains unnecessarily clumsy.   To a degree, the game's missions seem to be designed with this in mind.  There aren't as many of the anti-aircraft missions that grew so maddening in AC2, especially in the early going, and aerial targets seem to have been granted less of that wasp-like speed and maneuverability.  Meanwhile, the new ~Over Boost~ feature extends the amount of boost power available, so there's more leeway in flight and while quickly maneuvering on the ground to compensate for the controls.  But it would still be even better if there were no control problems to compensate for, and proper dual analog control would solve that problem neatly.   Strange that From went halfway in the control department, because most every other part of the game has been made a fair bit more user-friendly.  The mission tree offers more opportunities in the early going, and the difficulty curve doesn't seem quite so stiff as AC2.  This time, only the truly incompetent will wind up in debt early on, although it's still important to develop those piloting skills during the simpler missions.  Core design, as I say, is much more flexible, with fewer situations where the game flatly refuses to let you drive a particular Core configuration.  The plot is more engaging than before, too, with a neat mystery surrounding the ~Controller~ that runs the world -- reminds me a little bit of the old Japanese comic Grey, if you've read that one.  Multiplayer, to finish things off, now supports four combatants at once, even if that does require the use of a cumbersome system link.   From my perspective, though, the control remains a sticking point, never mind what From's opinion may be on the subject.    Graphics  As before, it's a pity the game has to have its hangups, because along with the improvements in its design come nicer-looking worlds as well.  AC2 mainly concentrated on making the Cores look better, with backgrounds that remained somewhat drab and basic.  Then again, it was set on Mars, after all.  AC3 shifts the stage to Earth, though, and with that change in scenery comes more impressive and varied backgrounds -- relatively speaking, anyway.   Outdoor environments are now quite common, although the series doesn't entirely forsake the underground tunnels of its past excursions.  There are swamps shrouded in mist, shootouts on top of hydroelectric dams, more open city environments (complete with a little interactivity in the form of shattering windows) and a great many other different types of terrain.  Multilayered areas also come into play, with bigger stages that occupy more vertical space.   The Cores, meanwhile, still look plenty sharp, just as they did in AC2.  AC3 adds some more detailed lighting effects to the picture, resulting in better gradations of color on the mecha bodies, but the existing standard didn't demand a great deal of improvement.  The total package has worn a little bit in comparison to the competition on PS2, but with little advancement of late in the specific mecha action genre, Armored Core 3's visuals still hold up pretty well.   Sound  Meanwhile, the sound has taken a pretty substantial leap.  This is actually the first PS2 game released anywhere with Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound -- it came out in Japan before the first American DPLII game, Spider-Man.  You can tell this is an early effort for using the format in realtime, but there are still plenty of cool separation effects, particularly in missions where enemies swarm around you.  The style of the series' music and sound effects hasn't changed much since the last game, but if you have a system that supports DPLII, that addition more than makes up for it.   And as per usual, Agetec does a fine localization job, although the flat delivery of mission briefings and status updates doesn't demand a great deal of range from an actor.  Nevertheless, the voices catch the appropriate tone, and the one character who does develop a bit -- your control, Laine -- does gradually improve as the game goes on.I just wish the series would commit to more than gradual improvement.  At this pace, it looks like I'll be able to give an unqualified thumbs-up round about Armored Core 5 -- say, four or five years from now.  From Software could do so much more with these games, and instead it seems committed to doing the same damn thing over and over.For those content with this style of gameplay, well, more power to you.  You should have no problems whatsoever with Armored Core 3.  It's a definite rent-it-first for anyone else, though, lest you fear getting stuck with a lemon on your hands (subjectively speaking, of course).  Until Armored Core 4, then, here's to what might have been.", "date": "Sep 9, 2002"}
