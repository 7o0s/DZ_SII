If I had not reviewed it, I would have hardly noticed it, an Infogrames release from a developer I'm not familiar with preceded by hardly any hype whatsoever.  That is why this job is so interesting sometimes (it almost makes up for the hateful, maddening bits), because it exposes me to experiences that I'm glad I didn't miss.  NGEN doesn't quite earn admittance into the hall of fame occupied by games like Wipeout and F-Zero, but it does something new for the field of high-speed racing, and an original idea executed well is always deserving of praise.  The high concept here is that, in the future, the hip new racing machines of the moment are not hovercraft but decommissioned fighter jets, which have had their drab military paintjobs replaced by the bright colors of international racing teams.  They race on low-altitude courses filled with sharp turns and obstacles, and in the faster classes weaponry is allowed, keeping a few vestiges of the planes' dogfighting heritage.  Here and there are power-up rings you can fly through, increasing your health or your stock of afterburner fuel, which you can use to boost your speed at key moments.  The key to winning races is flying low and grabbing the afterburners - wimps who stick to the safe high altitudes do so at a substantial cost in speed.  You don't have to worry too much about running into the ground, since in defiance of all logic you just bounce off and lose a little speed and health.  Oh, well, suspension of disbelief and all that.  The game is divided up into four classes (Trainer, Fighter, S-Fighter, and X-Fighter), which correspond to both skill level and speed, and as you work your way through them, the competition gets both faster and more aggressive.  Once you're in the tougher races, breaking 1000 MPH while the other competitors are tossing missiles this way and that, the intensity level gets pretty darn high.  You work your way up through the classes in the NGEN championship mode, a lighter analog of Gran Turismo's simulation mode.  It doesn't quite have GT's absurdity of depth, but there's an awful lot to do nonetheless.  There's a few dozen different planes, most of them nifty-looking descendants of modern fighter craft, as well as modifications for your engines, aerodynamics, hull type, and more.  They honestly affect your speed and handling, especially funky add-ons like variable-thrust jets, and some of the aerodynamic mods are visually represented when you race.  Kit out your plane with canards or stabilizer modifications, and you'll see them the next time you take it to the track.  The many racing championships have a very British or European quality to them, all named after a venerable trophy like the ~Athol-Brose Bowl.~  It's cool to be able to win them and then see a 3D-rendered version of the cup displayed in your virtual trophy case.  The learning curve is pretty nicely sloped, but the Trainer races are awfully sedate in comparison to the later circuits.  You're liable to be a little disappointed at first by the slow pace.  However, it's not hard to make your way through them and get to the good stuff - in fact, the permit tests that earn you admittance into the later classes of the championship mode are almost little too easy.  The NGEN mode enforces an informal sort of restriction on the upper classes through the simple cost of the aircraft, though.  You can earn your X-Fighter permit straight away, but you can't afford a credible competitor in those races until you work through the lower classes.    If you find yourself steamrolling your way through every class despite all this, odds are you've been picking the default arcade controls.  Arcade and Pro controls are available, very reminiscent of the difficulty shifts in Air Force Delta.  Arcade lets you bank easily to the left or right with the analog controls, whereas Pro gives you much more realistic control over your aircraft - you have to use your rudders, elevators, and ailerons to bank and turn.  Trying to master the more advanced system opens up a whole new level of difficulty, but you don't necessarily need to try it if you don't feel up to the task.  The first commandment issued to the graphics in a game like this is that they move quickly, and the second is that they move smoothly.  NGEN goes against neither of these directives, presenting a fast and uninterrupted framerate.  The aircraft models and explosion effects don't quite compare to something like Ace Combat or any next-generation flight simulators, but considering the size of the backgrounds and the speed the game has to move at, they look good enough, and the planes are set off well by highlighting effects during both day and night races.  The backgrounds, as I said, stretch far off into the distance, and some of their textures are pleasantly surprising.  Flying over lakes, you can see the landscape and sky reflected in their surfaces.   I suppose the balance of what can be said against NGEN is that it is something of a niche game, and it doesn't present the kind of brand-new standout experience that we encountered in Wipeout or F-Zero.  The addition of a third dimension is interesting, but not quite revolutionary, and some of the tracks aren't particularly inspired designs, consisting mainly of long straights and predictable curves.  Oh, and if you don't like rave music (like some of my co-workers, who became a little vocal on the subject), you may find yourself turning the soundtrack volume down - although if you do like it, the game does have some rather nicely hypnotic beats.  In a lean month for actual completed releases, NGEN was a pleasant surprise, and if you check it out, you should enjoy its particular breed of high-speed racing.  -- David Smith", "date": "Jun 22, 2000"}
