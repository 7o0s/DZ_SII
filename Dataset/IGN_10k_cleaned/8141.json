Quite simply, Mario vs. Donkey Kong on GBA was a real tour de force with the plumber demonstrating the kind of acrobatic abilities that would put most Olympic gymnasts to shame. But as enjoyable as that game was wipe it from your memory, because March of the Minis is an entirely different experience and anyone expecting to see more of the same superhuman agility will be sorely disappointed.   That said, the lack of acrobatics doesn't mean March of the Minis isn't an enjoyable addition to the DS's rapidly expanding catalogue. It just means Nintendo has taken a very different route with this sequel. Instead of focusing on Mario and his majestic moustache, Nintendo has taken one of the more curious elements of the GBA game and built an entire around it. We're talking the undeniably charming mini Marios which, for us at least, were the star of the show last time around. So, with the Mario we all know and love out of the picture, it's up to you to lead the mini Marios to victory, using the DS's good ol' stylus.    March of the Minis has been compared to Lemmings by many, presumably because the little guys in the game are so stupid they'd happily stick their faces into a meat grinder unless you tell them not to. However, apart from this similarity the two don't really have that much in common.   In fact it's bears much more of a resemblance to the SNES classic Mario and Wario, in which players had to guide Mario through a series of levels packed with spikes and disappearing platforms, using the Super NES mouse. The mouse aside, that's pretty much what you have to do in March of the Minis, using the stylus to guide the petite plumbers to safety.    Being one of the few DS titles that dispatches with traditional D-pad and button controls almost entirely, you control the action using the touchscreen, swiping the stylus to make the mini Marios start walking. If a change of direction is in order simply sweep them the opposite way. You can also make them stop and jump too, by tapping the screen or stroking the stylus upwards, but this proves a little clumsy when you're trying to direct a big group of Minis. However, for the majority of the game it's beautifully fluid, giving the player total control over what's going on with just a few brushes of the stylus.   The aim of the game is simple: lead the ranks of Marios to the level's exit without drowning them, setting them on fire or letting them get attacked - in other words, avoiding all potentially lethal situations. As a concept, it's wonderfully simple, but to play it's anything but. Wedged firmly between your Marios and the level exit are a range of devious obstacles, designed specifically to make your life miserable - in that time-honoured glee-giving masochisitic manner.     Within levels, there are enemies to ride, springs to bounce off, high wires to tread and even magnetic walls to navigate. Although touted as a puzzle game, really it's more of an action title because there's always something happening and very little time to think, thanks to the constant clock countdown. Of course, the puzzle element comes into play as you attempt to suss out the best way and order in which to tackle obstacles, maximising the number of Minis reaching safety.   On paper (or rather on-screen) it sounds like a lot to deal with - particularly when you factor in the sheer number of Mini Marios bumbling into danger at any one time. However, the game has an excellent learning curve, enabling players to get to grips with the basics of navigation before ramping up the complexity. Normally, each zone adds a new obstacle or enemy to the mix, which could then be carried through to later levels. So, by the end of the game, you'll be prepared for even the toughest challenge - which is just as well, really.    Most stages can potentially be completed within a few tries - it's often simply a case of learning the layout, working out how to tackle each obstacle then, finally, bringing all your hard work together. However within each level there are special letters to collect and a grade (bronze, silver or gold) to achieve depending upon your score - both of which unlock new features. Getting a gold grade requires leading all the Marios through the exit as closely as possible, forming a chain of sorts. This frequently totally changes the way you approach a level, with a much greater focus on timing. It also adds a lot of replay value to the game because it's super tough to get the gold stars on later stages.   However, the greatest bolster to Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2's longevity is the inclusion of an extremely thorough level creator. By completing stages in the single-player mode, you unlock construction packs that can be used to design your own levels. Thankfully, creating a new stage is absurdly simple and - best of all - you can share your masterpieces wirelessly or go online to get new stages from friends. Get involved with a strong community of March of the Minis fans and it's a game that keeps on growing, even after the main adventure is long over.Comparing March of the Minis to the GBA Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a futile task. Besides sharing the same moniker and characters, the two are entirely different beasts. This sequel offers DS owners an almost entirely unique experience thats tough, enjoyable and superbly implemented. Admittedly keeping check of your Minis would have been much easier with some kind of map on the top screen but thats only a minor niggle. A niggle that's easy to overlook when you consider the brilliantly engaging single-player game. Throw in that extensive level creator and, potentially, the fun of March of the Minis never has to end.", "date": "Feb 28, 2007"}
