The guys at Creative Assembly that make the Total War games seem to love their jobs and it shows. So far they've managed to create nothing but good games and expansion packs for those games. Their latest, Viking Invasion, the expansion to Medieval: Total War continues the streak with style and a lot of new gameplay that should satisfy fans' hunger for strategy until their next full game in the series is released sometime next year.    Viking Invasion takes a step back in the timeline from Medieval and falls out of the Middle Ages right into the grimy and war torn Dark Ages. The game also takes a step out of Europe as a whole and focuses on a much smaller part of the whole. What is now known as England wasn't always just cockney accents and bad teeth. It was a land full of kings and torn by battle.    Some may not have realized this, but the Roman Empire actually extended all the way up into Britain for quite some time until its eventual collapse under its own bloated bureaucratic weight. When the Romans decided to pack up and move the Legions off of the island, all hell broke loose. Kings were being made and unmade with speed. The Irish and Scots had basically escaped all of the Roman rule and managed to hold their own ground (the Scots even managed to push into the Northwest isles on the main island), but the Piets, Welsh, Saxons, Northumberman, and Mercians were eventually all that was left of the many kingdoms that rose and fell during the Dark Ages.   Finally, around 793 AD, another group poked their bearded and grizzled faces into the thick of things. The Vikings, driven by the need of supplies and food that their snowbound countries just couldn't produce, decided that the lush green depressing country of the British Isles was some good plundering territory. So over they came with their longships, bent on a serious mission to upgrade their station in life. After the first attack and the plundering of a very rich monastery, it was hard for the Vikings to resist such fertile territory just like it's hard to resist beating Ivan up for his lunch money now that I know what a weakling he is and how much cash he has the audacity to carry around with him.   To take this big step back in time and focus on one area of Europe in a more detailed way, the Total War guys decided to take away the distraction of Europe on the strategic map and give the British Isles a full working over with tons of territories from that time period plus the Norse countries to the East to give the Vikings a home to invade from. This creates a whole new game that should be fun for everyone that played Medieval as well as provide plenty of interest for the history buffs out there (as long as they disregard the horned helmet of the guy on the cover of the box, it isn't indicative of the product inside).   The new campaign therefore follows this new set-up with the battle maps to accompany each territory. Viking Invasion not only allows you to play as the Vikings on their tear across the sea, but also as any one of the eight surviving kingdoms on the British Isles. Each of these kingdoms will provide a different level of difficulty with the eventual goal for all of the factions being unification of all of the territories into one whole merry country of England.    The Vikings add some interesting gameplay whether you're controlling them or one of the defending kingdoms. Not only are they powerful warriors (some of them like the Berserker and Huscarles are incredibly loyal and very strong), but they also have the advantage of an incredibly strong navy as was the case back in the day. The Vikings were the masters of the sea for quite some time and show their prowess with their boats that can move 3 territories a turn. Once you've got a chain set-up from the departing territory to the destination territory with a ship in each ocean space, you can instantly transport enemy troops onto unsuspecting shores, even if they don't have a port. This unique naval trait makes the Vikings very dangerous raiders that can make tons of money without too much effort.   In fact, you'll spend half the time raiding foreign soil to gain some money to feed your people, create bigger armies, and slowly build up the territories you've conquered. Rushing in and trying to grab too many territories at once is not a good practice for the industrially challenged Vikings. As long as you can muster a superior force to move in to a territory, force the defenders out, steal the money and leave, you'll be in the clear. The other factions won't have the money to spend and you can creep across the landscape, converting the citizens of the island into your own loyal subjects while building up your starving infrastructure.     The defenders have a lot more to worry about. Not only do they have to think about the Vikings raiding their shores, but they also have to worry about the other kingdoms that actually call the islands home. Eventually, someone is going to have to be totally victorious. Depending on the kingdom chosen, the game will take on a pretty different flavor. A couple of the kingdoms are much more powerful and wealthy than the others making their lot in life a little easier. The more difficult of the kingdoms, such as the Scots, have problems because their all of their territory contains coastline for the Vikings to raid into as well as not being as powerful as the rest of the kingdoms. It's an uphill battle, but one that most players will relish getting a shot at.   Some other time sensitive conditions are also a big part of getting an economy up and started as well. As you can imagine, the British Isles weren't always the rolling hills filled with farms and towns that they are today or even by the Early period in the original Medieval. Instead, they were heavily forested and not yet suitable for agriculture. Therefore, before you can build farms in many of the territories, you're going to have to clear cut the forests first. This takes a long time, but once done will help your kingdom immensely. It's just a matter of balancing this need with the need to build armies and other structures.   The changes to the religious structure of the game are also rather significant. Because the Pope hadn't really made his mark quite yet, the Viking Invasion territories are exempt from the ~thou shall not attack other Catholics~ shtick. Not only will you not have that pesky Pope telling you what you can and can not do, you also won't have to worry about the Inquisition as it's still hundreds of years until its creation during the period that Viking Invasion takes place. And because you're dealing with the Norse peoples, you'll have the chance to build Pagan Shrines that will convert much of the populace away from Christianity and into the loving embrace of the various Norse gods. This is especially important to the Vikings as the reward for their raiding skills will diminish if more then half of their population becomes Christian.   With all of these changes and focused gameplay, Viking Invasion gives a really fun and challenging campaign.   But the additions didn't stop there. Along with the new Viking and bandit units made specifically for that time period (which can carry over a bit into the Early period of the original game now) many new units have been added for several of the civilizations in different periods. Arab Infantry, Byzantine Lancers, Swabian Swordsman, and Steppe Heavy Cavalry are just a few. It seems that they've rounded the Slavic nations out a bit as most of these additions come from those territories. One special artillery unit has also been added. The Organ Gun is one of the first anti-infantry gunpowder artillery units. Looking like organ pipes, it fires several shots at once, takes a long time to reload, and is almost as likely to blow up in the crew's face as it is to work well on the enemy. The strange trick for this piece of weaponry is that once you place it in the pre-battle set-up, you can't move it again. It can rotate to track targets, but it can't move leaving it pretty vulnerable without support.    What did you think of Medieval: Total War - Viking Invasion? Finally, a new historical battle has been added for those that like to reenact some of the more famous battles throughout history. In Viking Invasion's case, this is the battle for Stamford Bridge which recreates a major victory against the Vikings by King Harold. Like the other historical battles, it's a challenge that you'll feel really good about beating.  I like these guys at Creative Assembly; they don't skimp where others might. There's doesn't seem to be such at thing as half-assed to these guys and that's really appreciated by me and the gamers out there that have to shell out 30 dollars for an expansion pack. While I still tend to think that's a little high for an expansion, it seems to be the norm these days. I'm just glad that they actually made it much more worth the investment. Not only does it add a very new and entertaining Campaign experience with a lot of replay, but also buffs up the original game with new content meant to refine. Those fans that are looking to add to their Medieval experience won't be disappointed with the Viking Invasion expansion pack.", "date": "Jun 4, 2003"}
