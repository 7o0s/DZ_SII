Here is a game that is physically fun to play, lets you burn calories, and lets you listen to music all at the same time. DDR is the antithesis for every other game that has you huddled under your blanket in a dark room as you try and blast the latest invading alien species. And that's not a bad thing.  Dance Dance Revolution: Ultramix is the latest in the series (and the first for Xbox), and as you might expect, not that much has changed - it's the nature of the series. In case you've been out of the loop for the last decade or so, DDR works like this: a song plays in the background and arrows corresponding to buttons on the mat/platform you're standing on rise up to the top of the screen. Your job is to step on the corresponding button at just the right time, essentially dancing to the beat. It's a great formula that is as addictive as it is simple.   So what makes Ultramix different from any other DDR game? Well, in terms of gameplay mechanics, nothing really - you still listen to songs while dancing on the pad (or using a controller, of course). What does make Ultramix special is the inclusion of online play, a first for the series. The typical Xbox Live options are included, and the game supports up the four players online. Note that when using the dance pad, using the communicator for voice chat is not the easiest thing to do. You can, however, have the vocal output come out of your television speakers. We should also note that while online play is great, it's only as great as the people playing it. Honestly, we had trouble finding a large number of opponents to play. Luckily, this game has just as much to offer in the single-player modes.  Online play was smooth, and we encountered no noticeable lag. For a game that requires precision timing, the lack of lag is a blessing. Also, the Xbox Live service can be used to download new songs to the already hefty roster (a little less than 50 tunes), though they do come at a price - a buck a piece, available in packs of five. While many of you may be against the idea of buying new downloadable content, it's inevitable that it become more and more prevalent as the online user base increases. Expect this to be a trend that only gets more popular.    Outside of the online play, Ultramix has a slew of other modes that actually have enough variety to them to warrant specialized modes. There is the standard Game mode which lets you pick a song, difficulty level, and such and plays just like you would expect. The Battle mode is divided into Score or Point battle, and lets up to four players compete against each other for highs scores or point deductions, respectively. Another, perhaps more interesting mode in the game is Workout mode. In this mode you can set your target weight and the game will actually put you on a workout program, complete with calorie stats. There is plenty of statistical data here, and the game can be a real workout, so yes, this is a legitimate exercising game. A Challenge and Training mode, as well as an Edit mode which lets you create dance routines for the included songs are also included, making this a very well-rounded DDR game.   One thing we should mention is the use of a controller versus using a dance pad. While using a controller is absolutely doable, you'll miss out on what makes DDR so much fun - the physical movement. Additionally, those looking to shed a few pounds will do anything but using only a controller. We highly recommend getting a dance pad (the game comes bundled with one for a $15 dollars more), or even two for either multiplayer or for the absolutely insane eight-panel single player mode.    DDR isn't meant to be a graphical showcase, so please excuse the lack of a dedicated graphics section. Outside of the arrows on the screen, you'll see either a polygonal, cel-shaded model dancing around, or some FMV provided by the group whose song is playing. Either way, you'll be much too busy dancing and watching the arrows to even notice what's going on in the background.  As for sound, Ultramix has music typical of the series - dance and R&B tunes. We can't say we're personal fans of the artists in the game, but within the context of the game, the songs are just fine. It would have been nice if there were some more mainstream and recognizable tunes like Samba de Amigo's soundtrack, but overall it's a trivial complaint. This game is about dancing and the sounds included are ab fab for that.Dance Dance Revolution: Ultramix is a great game. It's fun, physical, and so easy to get into that people of all ages can play and have fun, though the challenge-depraved should also take note as the game's harder songs and difficulty levels are just insane. The secret ingredient to the series is the simple and addictive gameplay. You're literally just pushing buttons on beat. The game's biggest crutch, ironically, is also the gameplay. While always fun, and always addictive, if you own any of the other jillion versions of the game, you'll have to ask yourself if the online play - the most notable addition to the game - is worth the price of the game. So while we love the game, just know that not much has changed in terms of gameplay. Ultramix just happens to offer the best package of DDR. Also, we can't stress enough how much better this game is with a dance pad. Shell out the extra $15 bucks and get one - you won't regret it. Ultramix is the most complete DDR package out there, with a ton of modes, online play and dance editor included. The ability to download new songs (at a price) also adds to the game's longevity. If you're new to the series, Ultramix is the one to get. If you're a hardcore DDR fan, this game is also worth your money. Only those that are casual fans or have other versions of the game should try before they buy.", "date": "Dec 9, 2003"}
