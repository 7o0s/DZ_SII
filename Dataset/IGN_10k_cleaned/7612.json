Sure, it doesn't have the ultra-dungeons of World of Warcraft, the minutely-balanced combat of Guild Wars or the endlessly evolving politicking of Eve. It doesn't, in fact, have a whole lot beyond beating people up. But there is one other thing, fundamental to its charm - it makes you feel important. After all, what other game has passing citizens comment, ~I heard The Entomologist [or insert your own hero name here] saved us all~? That they're saying this to a musclebound man in a cape and mask, with antennae sticking out of his forehead and a giant yellow 'E' on his chest, yet fail to twig that hey, maybe he's this famous Entomologist guy, doesn't really matter.    What matters is that we, playing as said insectoid avenger, feel pretty darn good about ourselves for hearing it. Grateful pedestrians have referred to us by name - that, together with the smug knowledge that no-one else in the game is dressed quite the same way as you is enough to make anyone feel just that little bit special. It makes the bounding, flying, teleporting and super-sprinting around gigantic cityscapes feel like it's achieving so much more than the MMO staples - collecting experience points and cash - on which the game is founded.    Since the game's beginning, both City of Heroes and its recent expansion pack City of Villains (now both available as an agreeably-priced two-pack, Good versus Evil Edition) have done a fine job of disguising that mechanical heart. It wows from the start, giving you an enormous palette of body shapes and sizes, ludicrous clothing and superpowers to create a character that feels unique, even if such individuality comes from the fact that you're the only guy in town wearing a purple skull mask on top of a pink ninja outfit, rather than from any of your actual abilities. From there, it's off to the streets of either Paragon City (if you're a goody two-shoes) or the Rogue Isles (if you're a dastardly evil-doer) to perform the usual rigmarole of pressing number keys to kill NPC baddies, level up, gain new powers, kill better and repeat. Other player Heroes and Villains are there to group with (or fight) if you so please, but, as we'll talk about shortly, City of Heroes and Villains is increasingly geared towards solo players too.   Because you're fighting on semi-living city streets, either saving harassed citizens or beating up law enforcement officers, it's that much more convincing than the Warcraft approach of sending you off to a field with some gnolls standing around, waiting for death. Particularly effective too is that most missions are instanced, giving you a private dungeon of your (and your group's, if you're in one) own, rather than having you endure the miseries of queuing up behind a bunch of other players all waiting to kill the same guy. CoH also chucks out the usual crafting and epic item looting in favour of designing new costumes (again, purely aesthetic) and earning titles. That it's all gained from constant combat makes it a little one-note compared to other MMOs, but the narrow focus does make for a much more coherent and direct game.    It's not standing still, either. The latest update for CoH, affectionately termed Issue 8, sees something of a refocusing from developer Cryptic on being a Hero. Lately, the devil's had all the best tunes - Villains, the stars of the first expansion pack last year, have enjoyed stuff Heroes don't have, so it's time to play catch-up. Specifically, this means Safeguard missions, a heroic equivalent of the cheerfully frantic Mayhem quests available to their wicked equivalents.   Safeguard missions aren't anything to bewilder an existing CoH player - they're instanced quests in large outdoor and indoor zones requiring you to foil a few NPC Villains from, for instance, robbing a bank. This involves killing all the baddies as always, but it's got to be done before they escape to their getaway vehicle. Essentially, it's just a mission with a time limit, but because said time limit is actually people physically running away rather than a countdown, there's a breakneck mania to the proceedings that standard quests are lacking.      After that, the zone is your sandpit. For fifteen minutes, you can hunt down swathes of enemies matched to your skill level to your heart's content. Defeat specific groups of vandals and you'll extend the timer; keep your eyes open for enemies acting especially suspicious and you might find a bonus mission or two. Basically, it's XP farming, but with a real sense of purpose and adrenaline, rather than just killing a glade full of respawning boars.   It's nothing fundamentally different from City of Heroes and Villains's common-or-garden PVE, and that's a shame. Cryptic talked of hugely destructible environments, but all we get is NPC baddies beating up cardboard boxes and bins - what we want is bank walls being smashed open to get to the loot and torn-up pavements from super-scuffles. It does, though, have a real race-against-time feel to it, and a far greater sense of being The Hero, rather than a hero. Instead of being just one more mook in spandex snooping about for trouble, you've been specifically called in by the police to prevent a major crime. Again, it's emphasising the sense of personal importance that no other MMO offers. That doesn't mean that it isn't going to get old fast, though. It adheres very strictly to the existing rules of the game and, as such, won't make a huge difference to anyone who stopped playing a while back because they wanted more variety.    Having said that, the redesigned Faultline zone may help persuade them to stay just a little longer. Previously the game's most impressive area - an earthquake-shattered city section crumbling into vast chasms in the ground - it was also both too tricky for young heroes to roam solo, and offered nothing for high level players. Using the excuse that it's undergoing municipal repairs, it's now open to all rather than being a group-orientated hazard zone. The increased safety and navigability makes it a real playground. Our character, The Entomologist, used his mega-jump power with relish in the new Faultline, bouncing from the bottom of a canyon here to a dangerously tilted abandoned skyscraper there, before plummeting from the top of a dam or leaping joyfully through the hole in the middle of a giant plastic donut. There may be no crafting or trade to speak of in City of Heroes and Villains, but there's still plenty of role-playing. No other game makes you feel quite this superpowered.    Faultine and the Safeguard missions both demonstrate the other refocusing that this update means for the game - Cryptic have twigged that an awful lot of people treat MMOs as if they were single-player games. Recent updates for World of Warcraft - and that game's upcoming expansion pack The Burning Crusade, in particular - have also demonstrated that there's a fair few folk who don't want to group with strangers or dedicate their entire lives to a play-every-night-without-fail guild. MMOs aren't, it seems, evolving quite as their creators expected. So, Issue 8's Safeguard missions are designed for either solo or small group play and, tellingly, are accessed by first completing three or four shorter standard missions. Basically, they're a single-player version of the huge, challenging Taskforces that require a large group of accomplished players to complete, and thus can be off-putting to casual Heroes. The playing field is now thankfully open; more or less the same opportunities are available to single-players and groupers alike. Hopefully, this move hasn't come too late in the day to prevent the hemorrhage of players to Warcraft and Guild Wars.    What this slight shift means is that City of Heroes and Villains has crept closer to the more complete game it needs to become. The Veteran's Reward scheme, a bunch of pleasing in-game freebies for long-time players, is clearly designed to lure back lapsed Heroes and Villains in the hope they'll then stay for the new content. It could well work, but until there's greater variety in the mission locations (offices, tunnels and sewers get really tedious after a while) and more to do once you're bored with random acts of cartoon violence than some fairly slight base-building and PvP, all but the most dedicated player is likely to lose interest after a while.If youve not Hero-ed or Villain-ed before, theres probably never been a better time to create a spandex-clad alter-ego. On-going graphical updates mean theres very little sense of CoH having aged, and the splendid Good versus Evil two-pack eschews the need to buy two separate games, giving you both the Hero and Villain stuff for one box price and subscription fee, together with the PvP content introduced since the initial releases. Youre not in for a hugely different experience whether you choose good or evil, though Villains arguably suffers a little for being too similar to its parent and placing strict limits on just how nasty you can be as a result. With everything now in one place though, for sheer character nothing can touch City of Heroes and Villains. The Issue 8 features - despite meaning an extra 300Mb download - certainly help consolidate its place in the higher echelons of MMO-dom. The overall score below, then, is for the current state of the entire game post-update, rather than purely the new features.", "date": "Nov 16, 2006"}
