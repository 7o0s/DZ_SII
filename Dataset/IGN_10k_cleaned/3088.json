Well, that's what we would've said a few years ago.  With all the characters from its arcade counterpart, Children of the Atom  should provide you with some mad capped comic-strip mayhem. Should. Instead,  Acclaim's port delivers a generic arcade port filled with nasty loadtime and choppy animation which ultimately strips the joy out of rumbling with your favorite X-Men characters.  To reiterate: the  loadtime is unbearable, the graphics are annoying and out-dated, and by now, the  general audience has already grown old of the senseless button mashing. You  spend half your time wrestling with the controller, and if you're lucky,  you can actually pull off some of the special X moves. Like all of Capcom's 2D fighting games, the main focus to winning is to roll your  thumb around (half-circles rule! Not) the keypad while pushing any punch button. Maybe it's just us, but we're tired of all-you-cans and ha-doo-kens.  We're not going to waste too much time on this game. The character animation bites, the loading time is horrible, what more do you need? Children of the Atom would've been a 16-bit phenomenon in older times, but in our day in age, however, Children of the Atom... bombs.", "date": "Mar 4, 1998"}
