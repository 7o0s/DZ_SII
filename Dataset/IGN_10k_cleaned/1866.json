However, this can also be a good thing,     especially if you love Mega Man's     tried-and-tested gameplay style.        Mega Man X is older and tougher looking than the regular Mega Man, and as such should appeal to an older audience. He's a little lankier, and has the     ability to jump/climb up sheer surfaces.     This one addition adds immensely to the     gameplay, creating all sorts of new     conundrums for Mega Man to deal with.       The game has the standard eight     levels, each with a sub-boss and big boss.     As always, there are tons of hidden items     and areas, and, as always, Mega Man     acquires a new weapon with the defeat of     each boss. The level design is standard Mega Man fare, with plenty of platforms to jump and bad guys to shoot.       One thing that separates Mega Man X4     apart from the last game in the series, Mega     Man 8, is the presence of Zero, Mega     Man's blonde-haired counterpart. Zero can do     everything Mega can do, except he1s got a     powerful sword instead of a blaster. The     game can be played as either Mega or Zero,     with a different storyline unfolding     depending on who you play as. This adds replay value to the game, something often missing in linear platform titles.   The control is top-notch, of course, and the graphics are as beautiful as 2D can be. However, like with Capcom1s 2D fighters, I still get the feeling I've played this all before. Yes, Mega Man X4 is a solid game, but no, it doesn't really offer anything new to the series. If you can't get enough of Mega Man, by all means pick this up. But if you1ve already played a Mega Man game and didn't care for it too much, don't bother.", "date": "Oct 1, 1997"}
