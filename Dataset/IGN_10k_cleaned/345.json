And it was bad. Hoo-boy, was it bad  not the games per se, just the entire collection: that compilation of Atari 2600 Activision games had so much wrong about it  poor system emulation, slow interface, and absolutely no historical background for each of the 30 games that were included on the disk.  This year, Activision tries again with the whole retrogaming scene with a 30-game compilation pack of the Atari 2600's competitor during the early '80s: the Intellivision. Intellivision Classic Games addresses most of the problems that plagued last year's retro pack, with one exception: these games just aren't fun to play. Gameplay Intellivision Classics has been developed by the same team that created the first compilation pack for Activision: Livesay Technologies. These guys were brought back to create a program that would emulate the Intellivision hardware on the PlayStation, and they did. In comparison to last year's pathetic Atari 2600 emulator in Activision Classics, the developer did a great job on the Intellivision emulation. That's where this pack excels.  This pack of Intellivision classics includes 30 games that were released in the 80s. Here's the list, and tell me if you can spot what's wrong with this picture:   Armor Battle Astrosmash Auto Racing Baseball Basketball Boxing Checkers Chess Football Frog Bag Golf Hockey Hover Force Las Vegas Poker and Blackjack Night Stalker Pinball Sea Battle Shark! Shark! Skiing Sharp Shot Snafu Soccer Space Armada Space Battle Space Hawk Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball Stadium Mud Buggies Star Strike Sub Hunt Tennis    Figure out what's missing? You got it...where are the Activision titles that were released on the Intellivision system? Pitfall, Stampede, Dreadnaught Factor...they're not here! Cripes, that's all that was in the Activision Classics compilation  Activision has a library of free games to use in this pack, and the company doesn't use them.  But as it stands, these 30 games are one-shot only games. Most of the sports games -- Baseball, Hockey, Football, Basketball, Boxing -- are for two players only. Now be honest, are you really going to drag your friend over just so you can play a simplistic game of Baseball or basketball? No, you're going to play Triple Play or NBA Live from EA, not these basic, clunky games. And you're definitely not going to boot up an emulator on the PlayStation to play Chess or Checkers  slow AI.   And what's worse, half these games require a combination of button pushes to perform basic tasks. The Intellivision used a 24-way control ~disk,~ a 12-button keypad, and four action buttons for its controller. Now, you can simulate the control disk with the Analog stick on the Dual Shock controller, but all those buttons? Forget it. All games have the ability to bring up a numeric pad on-screen by hitting L1 and L2 together, and this is especially useful for games that require a number input in the middle of the game (like Poker/Blackjack). The Intellivision wasn't exactly known for easy controls, but most of the games on this pack are downright unplayable without that clumsy Intellivision controller.   There are a couple of cool games in this collection: Hover Force is a way-cool helicopter shooter with somewhat decent graphics and sound, and surprisingly deep gameplay. Snafu was always a favorite  just picture Tron Light Cycles with snakes and a groovy soundtrack. But other than these gems, this is not a compilation pack you'll be booting up for fun. Maybe for a few laughs...  The other plus is the historical ~talking head~ interviews with the gang responsible for the original Intellivision games. It seems like it was thrown together  it's just these guys in front of a bluescreen talking about cool things that happened back in the day. But at least this pack has a bit of historical information  unlike last year's Activision offering.  Graphics  What was seen on televisions in millions of households back in the early '80s is seen in all its pixelated glory on the PlayStation. The graphics emulation is near perfect  a few sprite glitches here and there, but all in all Livesay Technologies came through with a great game system emulator, at least in graphics. You can even stretch and shrink the screen to fit your TV without too much distortion. Sound The sound emulation isn't perfect, it's slightly muffled and distorted. And I've never had a game that kicked on my sub-woofer so fiercely in my life  Shark Shark literally makes my room shake when the shark enters the screen with the familiar ~Jaws~ theme. But other than that, the emulation is acceptable.  I'm all for classic games on the current systems, but even I can tell how boringly bad most of these Intellivision games are  I will never, ever boot up this disk after this review because I had to struggle through many of the controls. Games are supposed to be fun, not work  and without that keypad controller, these games are a pain in the ass to play. I'm also very upset that Utopia didn't make the cut, nor did any of the licensed games like Tron Deadly Disks or AD&D  these, in my opinion, were the best Intellivision games available, and they're not on this disc. Sorry folks, just because it's retro doesn't mean it's good.", "date": "Oct 23, 1999"}
