Teetering on the very edge of control, the sensation of speed is intense as the muddy path ahead twists and turns. The other racers in the pack are kicking up huge chunks of dirt, carving deep paths through the moist terrain as I fight to overtake them. A hairpin provides the perfect opportunity and I let my foot off the accelerator, tap the brake and swing the wheel hard, the front of the car pivoting gracefully, mere centimetres from the inside of the corner, before correcting the turn and accelerating off down the straight. I tear past an opponent, but there's no time to savour the moment, as there's another driver in sight. Nor is there time to admire the environment as I drive, but it's gorgeous - the lush green palm trees and dense foliage to either side fitting the SEGA Rally series like a glove. The frantic battle continues as we loop back past the starting line, the furrows from the first lap crisscrossing the course ahead. I've made some ground on the leader of the pack, but have a long way to go to squeeze out a victory by the end of the third lap. Better stop typing and keep playing then.   I came third. Sod it all. Having progressed all the way through the Premier and Modified sets of championships, and on into the final set - Masters - it's clear that this is a seriously challenging arcade racing game. It's also clear that it's a masterful piece of game design, a glorious marriage of cutting edge tech, iconic art direction, endlessly replayable courses and accessible but deep handling mechanics. In short, SEGA Rally is back, in what is close to a perfect reinvention of the series.   Easy left, easy right, Eazy Duz It.  But let's rewind. I wasn't always coming third. In fact, at the beginning of the game I was carving up the pack, dominating as we screamed and slid our way through open African plains, around steep mountain hairpins and along the rich red canyon runs. SEGA Rally is the very definition of pick up and play - the action is so immediately gratifying, the speed and eye-candy so in your face, that it's hard to imagine someone not liking it. (And no, that's not a challenge for the comments thread). It's the distilled essence of arcade racing heaven, but thankfully it's also a whole lot more. You see, initial thrills are all well and good, but a modern arcade racer needs more to hook its audience in for the long haul.   Thankfully, as alluded to above, SEGA Rally delivers in this regard. You really will have to master the handling and learn the best lines to take on each course if you hope to compete further into the game. The learning curve is steady, but whether the team has completely nailed the balance between challenging and impossible is debatable. We'll get to that in a minute.   For now, let's talk about what SEGA Rally has to offer. The Championship mode is the meat of the game, and is broken into three major classes: Premier ('race with the world's leading rally cars'), Modified ('race with popular rally prepared performance cars') and Masters ('race with a legendary mix of classic rally cars'). Needless to say, you'll start out in Premier, then unlock Modified, then Masters. Each class is structured in a similar way, with Amateur, Professional, Expert and Final difficulties to work through, representing 11 GPs (or 33 races) per class.   Out and out arcade racers? That's how SEGA rolls. Bless 'em.  The progression system is fantastic, and entirely points-based. There are ten points up for grabs in each race, so you'll net ten for first, eight for second and so on down the line. Building up points unlocks new sets of races, and with some reasonable performances it won't be too hard to move from Premier into Modified, then on to Masters. The real test, in fact, is accessing the Final GP in each class. To do so, you need 275 points in the relevant class - out of a possible 290 available up until that point. That ain't easy.   There's plenty to keep you coming back though. While there aren't a huge number of courses - three forwards and backwards in each of the settings: Safari, Alpine, Canyon, Arctic and Tropical, they're almost all excellent. A couple of less interesting circuits notwithstanding, SEGA Rally throws all sorts of challenges at the player, ramping up from easy but undeniably thrilling, through to seriously testing, demanding both extensive course knowledge and handling expertise. Whether you're rocketing along a cracked tarmac road, pine forests on either side, snow capped peaks in the distance, or you're wheeling down around the precipitous slalom-esque corners of the game's rocky, arid badlands, each surface is subtly different, and each setting has its own aesthetic.    And taking the action to another level is SEGA's terrain deformation tech. Unlike Motorstorm's wide open paths and multiple routes, SEGA Rally's courses are generally pretty narrow, so when five cars are ripping up the earth in front of you, you can really feel it. It's not like it drastically affects handling - it's subtle, but when combined with rumble, the immersion levels go through the roof. The effect looks great too, really giving texture to the racing surfaces. There's nothing like watching the cars ahead carve through freshly fallen snow or spray up a stream of mud, and when you move from fighting ruts in the dirt onto smooth tarmac, the contrast is amazing. Suddenly you're gliding.   I think it was the Chemical Brothers who wrote,   You'll revisit each course a number of times across the three classes, but the changes to handling and difficulty as you progress are something of a mixed blessing. Moving from Premier to Modified, for instance, sees a marked change in the handling. Suddenly the cars at your fingertips (moving on from a range including the Subaru Impreza WRX and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX in Premier, to the likes of the VW Golf GTI and Peugeot 207 Super 2000 in Modified) have much more weight to them, meaning that you can't fling them around corners in quite the same way - it's more of a battle against the terrain, and sticking to a good racing line becomes even more important. This feel flows on to Masters, which features rally classics like the 1976 Lancer Stratos and that SEGA Rally icon, the Toyota Celica ST205. So far so good.   The way the AI ramps up, however, is a potential source of frustration. It's only gradual, but by the time you're well into the Modified class, the opponents have become seriously tenacious, unwilling to give any ground. At least, sometimes they are. The tuning of the AI seems a little uneven to us - on some courses you won't have too much trouble coming first, but on others (such as Alpine 1) you'll be lucky if you even see the guy in third place. It's a shame, because when the AI is somewhere in between, the tussle is never less than compelling, and you have to be on the money for every turn to come in first. Still, the points structure means even with a few embarrassing finishes you'll be able to play through the vast majority of the game, but unless you're some kind of rally guru, it's going to be tough going if you want to play through the Final GP in each class. But hey, when the frustration levels start rising, take a break and get together with some friends online.   Good to see SEGA lowering its in-game carbon footprint.  And you know what? The somewhat uneven AI isn't a deal-breaker. While it is the major thing holding this title back from a 9 or higher, there's just so much else to love about this game that it's still a must-play. In particular - for my sensibilities at least - I love the combination of unapologetically arcadey elements (no stats or damage for the cars, and barriers at the side of all the courses) with surprisingly deep gameplay and a meaty championship structure. And if we haven't made it clear already, this is a gorgeous looking game; quintessentially SEGA in its stylings.  If this is what happens when SEGA takes a beloved franchise and hands development duties over to a carefully constructed studio outside Japan, then perhaps they should do it more often. The UK-based SEGA Driving Studio has managed to capture the essence of the SEGA Rally experience, while also integrating stunning new tech and giving gamers a serious challenge. Its not perfect, but it is criminally fun. Get it.", "date": "Sep 27, 2007"}
