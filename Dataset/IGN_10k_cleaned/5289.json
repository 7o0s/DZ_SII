Now the developer/publisher is adding horror action to the mix with the release of Haunted Planet, a scrolling shooter where you must face off against wave after wave of ghosts and zombies. It's a simple game -- but there's still an audience for simple pleasures, yes?   Features:   16 levels  Multiple monsters  Power-up items   Apparently, an Evil Scientist has done what Evil Scientists are apt to do: open an inter-dimensional portal to a world overflowing with monsters. As soon as that rift opened, monsters poured out into our world. You have 16 hours to close up shop or else the rift will ultimately lead to our earthly demise.   Haunted Planet will remind you somewhat of the classic SEGA shooter, Space Harrier. You view the action from behind your hero, who is always moving forward through a scrolling environment. The ground is littered with obstacles that must be avoided, or else your health will drop. Now, as far as classic games to emulate, Space Harrier is a pretty good pick -- and thusly, Haunted Planet provides some quick diversionary thrills.   To defeat the Evil Scientist, you must hurl axes at all of the monsters headed your way. On Easy, you can use an auto-fire feature to slay the beasties, but if you put the game on Hard, not only must you fire, but you must cycle through targets on your own, too. This is actually hard, like the name implies. Fortunately, there are power-ups like shields and enhanced axes that cleave bigger baddies with fewer shots.   There are 16 levels in Haunted Planet, each getting progressively harder. The first levels are a run through a heavily forested graveyard. Next, it's through a dank crypt full of zombies that will eventually open up into a marsh. Finally, it's time to storm the Evil Scientist's lab and shut down the portal.   The enemies are varied. Ghosts, Frankenstein's Monsters, Brides of Frankensteins, Skeletons, Zombies, Vampires -- you name your favorite horror staple and Haunted Planet delivers. The little sprites are actually decently detailed.   Visually, Haunted Planet is pretty good. The scrolling moves along fairly smoothly, even if objects sort of ~pop up~ on the horizon without much scrolling effect. Occasionally, it is impossible to avoid obstacles because the game spreads them so wide across the screen you'll have no where to run. You can try to stay along the road -- the center of the screen -- but the problem with this is that power-ups are often dropped off the beaten path. You'll dash to the side to grab a shield, only to run smack into an unavoidable object. This is somewhat frustrating -- but at least the health drop for running face first into a tree is less than barreling into a zombie.  Mobliss will occasionally offer holiday-themed games and Haunted Planet was released just in time for Halloween. Of course, the spooky season has come and gone, but a game like Haunted Planet really doesn't require a set time frame to be enjoyable.Is Haunted Planet a super-complex game that offers eight hours of replay value? No. But, really, do they all need to be? If you liked Space Harrier and you like horror-themed titles, Haunted Planet is a fine diversion. Don't go in with terribly high expectations and you'll find yourself with an enjoyable way to burn an hour on the subway or in the backseat during rush hour.", "date": "Nov 16, 2004"}
