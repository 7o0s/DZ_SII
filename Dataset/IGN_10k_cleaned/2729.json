Full Fat, the developers of the GBA version of Dave Mirra 2, have created what's more like Nintendo's classic Punch Out than Majesco's own Boxing Fever game released last year. Unfortunately, strangely misbalanced game mechanics and a lack of features hurt the enjoyment of this Acclaim-published boxer. Features Twelve boxers Arcade, Vs. Mode, and Survival Only for Game Boy Advance Punch King is a very, very simplistic arcade boxing title with very little to do. It tries to offer both the familiar pattern-recognition design of Punch Out while giving players more freedom to wallop the opponent at any given time. In the game, the player (green hair, transparent and everythingan obvious nod to Nintendo's series) must work his way up the fight ladder of 12 different fighters, each with their own special attack along with the normal flurry of punches. It's a three round bout to get the other guy to kiss the canvasif you get knocked out three times, or if you can't knock him out by the end of the third round, the bout is over and you'll need to spend a credit to continue (you only get three). Players must watch their fatigue meter when they fight, since every punch will wear down your character until you'll have to take a break. But by filling up the K.O. meter with a string of successful punches, you won't have to worry about the fatigue meter at alland it's all about swinging your fists until the opponent can stand no longer.  I wouldn't use the word ~unique~ describing these opponents, because the character designers have definitely looked to the style established in Punch Out for the Punch King arsenal of boxers...the massively overweight Sumo wrestler, Basho Ishibashi, is more or less a clone of that gigantic Canadian lumberjack, Bear Hugger in Super Punch Outright down to his double-glove head slam special move that you need to duck at the proper moment. Most of these characters are drawn on the same exact body template, so these guys have the same familiar punch and block animations. Their attack patterns don't really change until they're ready to pull off their super secret ultra fighting move, which only has one real defense (dodge, block, duck or punch).   The graphics aren't too bad, at least in the backgrounds. The opponent sprites are large, but they mostly just ~bounce~ around the arena with minimal animationsand they're oddly scaled, zoomed in at a really strange ratio during 90% of the fight. This gives these guys a strange pixilated look while they spring around the ring like a hyper kangaroo.   The problem with Punch King is that its gameplay is not balanced well for the beginner player. Players who plop this game in the cartridge slot for the first time will get their rear-end handed to them in mere seconds, simply because the game design doesn't offer any training mode to wean players into the structure. The first few battles against the lowest ranking player will be an absolute massacre, at least until the player sees the pattern behind the attacks.  But even with the pattern recognition, Punch King relies on a seriously untweaked fatigue meter. Players can only throw punches when there's a specific amount of green flowing in the thermometer, so after landing a stunningly skillful combo against the opponent, you have to stand around like a goof waiting for your meter to refill. I understand the need and significance for this meter, but it should have been thought out a lot better than its implementation. And even though the game does depend on a bit of pattern recognition, some punches from your opponent will land for no real visible reason  The Vs. Mode option in the menu gives players the illusion that this game supports the link cable, but sorry folksthis game is a single player affair. This Vs. Mode just offers the ability to play against two of the characters you've fought against in the main modebut since the game doesn't have a cartridge save, you have to play through the game whenever you want to play the later characters in the Vs. Mode. Just a little tedious, yep.  No one is ever going to out-do Nintendo's Punch-Outit's just not entirely fair to judge a game by such a cool series at that one. I obviously didn't with Punch KingI think that if the game had a bit more time in development it could have been balanced a bit better. A training mode is sorely needed, because it took me literally seven tries to get the first boxer to stay down on the canvas. And the development team could have certainly included a few more options to increase the value of the product, since getting through the game's Arcade ladder will take a short couple of days to perfect. It's not a terrible game by any means, just awkward in its game design.", "date": "Jun 12, 2002"}
