{"name": "Silent Hill 3", "name_review": "Silent Hill 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/05/silent-hill-3-2", "text": "In the late 1990s when survival horror games hit their zenith, the equal blend of horrific stories, creative monsters and a newly imbued cinematic flair gave gamers a new thrill -- A chilling, occasionally shocking scare. While Capcom's Resident Evil provided shock and suspense, Konami's Silent Hill provided an eerie, surreal and disturbing sense of fright, one designed in the H.P. Lovecraftian style rather than in Mary Shelly's Frankenstein fashion.    Over the years, survival horror games have shown little growth in play mechanics and formula, and the Resident Evil series, to my dismay, has grown less and less frightening with each new iteration. Silent Hill 2, the PS2 follow-up to the first PS one title, provided a few band-aids here and there but essentially continued the series as it started. It remained an absolutely frightening, dreamlike and oftentimes obscure game, which usually only made only the slightest amount of sense.    Silent Hill 3 is a direct sequel to the first game, which explains a little more about Silent Hill 2's story, and follows in the footsteps of its predecessor with many new things: Storyline, monsters, and an entirely new set of characters. Quite honestly, for those who didn't like the first two, there isn't much here for you. It controls essentially the same as before, it flows with the same slowly unraveling storyline, it looks almost exactly like Silent Hill 2, and it's bizarre, dark and packed with psycho-sexual monsters, nurses, dogs and mannequins, and it's filled with lots of dark hallways. And there's a lot less fog.   However, despite all of the unchanged elements, Silent Hill 3 is still incredibly frightening and alarmingly addictive. Although a shorter game than before, it's well worth getting for the story and the chill of terror alone. Again, those tired of survival-horror and the familiar formula might disagree, but I love this game.   Video Review Available!

A typical teenager who loves shopping and hanging out with her friends, Heather meets a detective named Douglas who sends her running scared in a suburban mall. Heather finds herself transporting from reality to an alternate and horrific world in which blood soaked rooms, psychotic mannequin animals and split-headed dogs are the norm.    The game explains itself as players progress, but without giving too much away, Heather meets Claudia, a dark robed woman who tells her that within her lies the key to this nightmare, and if she remembers ~who she is~ all will become clear. As players progress they learn more about Claudia's role and what's more, they'll learn about how Douglas plays an important role in Heather's story.    Learning that she is the key to this abnormally symbiotic world, the protagonist is propelled into this frightening adventure with little more than a hand knife and her wits. As she flounders about, Heather often blacks out with pains in her head. Who is she really? Why is she so important? She is left with obscure trails, notes and clues, among which is this one: ~They've come to witness the beginning. The rebirth of paradise, despoiled by mankind.~     Without revealing too much, Silent Hill 3's story unveils more about the lead character, Heather, and the cult and characters behind Silent Hill than the previous two throughout the course of the game, while revealing less backstory tidbits via notes, clues and strange stories. Fans of Silent Hill 3 lore might like this approach less, because the game is shorter than the previous two and it's more direct in the way it delivers information. But for folks who've had a hard time figuring out what the hell was going on in the series, or for gamers new to the series, this third iteration is helpful. Also, since Silent Hill 3 ties in more directly to Silent Hill 1, it clarifies elements from the first, while being relatively easy to get into.    Gameplay  The most interesting and frustrating thing in every survival horror games is their control systems. They're deliberately meant to be slow paced, rendering them, in a sense, anti-action games. (This is, after all, an adventure game, which traditionally implies exploration, puzzles solving and a deep story.) These time-consuming elements help to create all the good things we like about the genre -- shock, horror, fright, tension, and in the case of Silent Hill, disturbing surreal horror -- but they also in turn create a sense of exasperation in gamers who like faster paced games. To date, there is no perfect solution though Silicon Knights' Eternal Darkness fared very well.   Not much has changed since Silent Hill 2, which offers a better control system than the Resident Evil series (for the record, the Resident Evil 3 Nemesis system was the most evolved of that series), but Konami's game has its own set of problems. Here, the control is exactly the same as before. The L2 button moves the camera, which follows and leads from a third-person perspective. Like before, players can swing the camera around Heather and rotate the perspective quite readily, except when the angle is deliberately set, which occurs a reasonable amount of times. I enjoy the flexibility of this camera, which is steady and offers many angles (except for up). R2 readies a weapon while X is attack, Square is block and now players can slowly strafe from side to side using the L1 and R1 buttons. Triangle calls up the map, Select opens the menu system, Start pauses the game, and by pressing R1 and L1 simultaneously, Heather spins 180 degrees. Heather collects a protective vest, which softens enemy blows, but it slows her down too, so the game is even a little slower than before.    Targeting is the same as before: It's automatic once a weapon is equipped and once an enemy is in range. The system works most of the time, but oftentimes enemies will leave the invisible target range or they will be down on the ground, which is when it falters, permitting Heather to blast her scrimpy supply of ammo wastefully into the darkness. The weapon supply resembles that of Silent Hill 2 in purpose if not entirely in function. Over the course of the game, Heather gathers a pocket knife, handgun, shotgun, lead pipe, a maul (like a morning star, but with the spiky ball attached to a long stick), a Katana, stungun, and submachine gun. The maul is heavy and slow, and resembles Pyramid Head's giant sword in use, and it's pretty worthless because of its weight and sluggishness. The Katana, lead pipe, handgun and shotgun will be your friends for most of the game.      The enemies are almost entirely new, save the return of the bloody, pipe-wielding nurses! Included is a hefty but not complete list of the enemies: Double Head (roving dogs), Closer (club-handed monster), Pendulum (annoyingly fast spinning mosquitoes), Numb Body (one-eyed creatures in large or small), Split Worm (first boss), Insane Cancer (bloated, slow-moving Hulk-type creature), Slurper (crawly annoying types), Nurse (with pipes), plus a few others who I won't mention now.

The level design is much the same as Silent Hill 2, except it's shorter than the previous two titles -- about 7-12 hours, depending on the person -- and there is a lot less fog. Also, there are fewer outdoor areas. Much of this game takes place inside and for those folks who've played Silent Hill 2, many of these areas look all too familiar. The commercial buildings look like the apartment complexes, the hospital looks like the hospital and so on. So, there is very little new, original or innovative in this game, except for new storyline.   That said, the chapel, amusement park, sewers and the subway systems are particularly excellent levels. Part of this is to do with structure. Thanks to more constrained, less open level design, there is less wandering around looking for what to do. It means more hall wandering, but more build up in tight areas. I know I was scared in Silent Hill 1 and Silent Hill 2, but man! This is once again a ridiculously scary game. I was jumping from my seat, jerking back in fright and in some sections I was so glad to have someone near me while I played. The sewers and the subway scared me sick.    There isn't too much to say about the puzzles this time around, other than that they maintain the good, solid puzzle quality from previus SH games. As usual, they work well into the game and players have a choice of selecting easy, medium or hard independent of the game difficulty setting. I found there were actually less and easier puzzles in this than in SH2, and so I was a little disappointed. What I still enjoy is that they blend excellently into the nature of the game.    While some folks are sick of the controls and the obscurity of the game's storyline or events (like, wa-hey the radio simply falls from the ceiling of the elevator? Wha???!!!), this third iteration helps to bookend much of the weirdness that has gone on to date with regard to the overall storyline arc, but it's also a faster game, which in some cases is better.    Graphics  Kaiser and I had an interesting debate about the graphics in Silent Hill 3. Are the graphics much better than in Silent Hill 2? Or are they simply an upgrade? Kaiser felt they are far better than in SH2, while I disagree. Having stared long and hard at both, I can say in all fairness that Silent Hill 3 looks better than SH2, but only in small subtle ways. It's not a big leap, it's a small one that some may not notice at all.    Silent Hill 3 re-captures all of the incredible filth, grittiness and decay of the second one, with a mixture of effects: Spectacular textures, an enormous amount of bloody walls, ceilings and bathrooms, and dozens and dozens of frighteningly dark scenarios. The level of detail is texture enormous, and the amount of dirt and grit also has returned to form a filthy, almost nauseating feeling in nearly every area.      Although I liked the real fog from SH2, there is far less of it here, so there is less of a feeling of claustrophobia. But the character models are subtlety more distinct. Heather's facial features are incredibly well formed, and the freckles on her face, the movement of her hair and even the specular highlighting in her eyes is incredibly well done.    The monster design follows very much in line with the other games in the series. It's neither better nor worse than SH2 though I can say for sure that none of the creatures scared me with their looks like in SH2. Their freaky design is still weird and grotesque, but the shock value is gone. And none of these guys outdo the freaks from before. Plus, though I loathed Pyramid Head (OK, it was more of a love-hate relationship), there is no creature of equal value in this game.    Sound  Sound plays a hugely important part in Silent Hill 3. Out of nowhere come screams and screeching falling objects. Scraping and scratching sounds abound. The radio once again picks up on nearby monsters and the ominous whirl of music that accompanies each one creates a lump in one's stomach of dread and fright. The sound effects and music are tightly interwoven and together they create an enormous level of mood in the often-bare environments. Plus, silence is golden, and in a game that's meant to frighten and unnerve you, the silent spaces here are infinitely well done.    Konami has done something nice for gamers this time around by giving them a bonus CD with Silent Hill 3. The game package includes a secondary disc with 25 songs in it, all original creations from the studio itself. The music is a little faster and rockier than in Silent Hill 2, but it still works well with the game.    Silent Hill 3 is a very good, very frightening game. It's just as scary if not more so than Silent Hill 1 or Silent Hill 2. However, two years after the second one on PS2, this game doesn't delivery much new material, gameplay, nor does it look or feel all that much different than its predecessors. In fact, it's created exactly in the same mold as the previous games, with almost no new alterations whatsoever. Konami has done little to widen its appeal to those disappointed with the second one, and nothing major to pull gamers sitting on the fence. While I have sadly grown tired of the Resident Evil series, I'm still very much in love with the Silent Hill series, and though I freely admit that this game is essentially nothing new -- except more guns and a new story -- I still am drawn into the horror, fright, and surreal qualities that comprise this quality game. So, yes, strangely I am happy to be scared sh*tless in the same way as before. Bu the point is I am still being scared! Silent Hill 3 still freaks me out, sucks me in and makes me awfully frightened to play this game in the dark by myself. And isn't that what's it's all about?", "date": "Aug 5, 2003"}
