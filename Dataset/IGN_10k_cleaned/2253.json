You'll feel claustrophobic in Tony Hawk 2X's levels after you've had a chance to explore some of the environments in this game. The game was the first Tony Hawk style extreme game on the PlayStation 2, and now it's only fitting that Mirra's one of the first on the Xbox as well.  The trick system is based on the concrete foundation of Tony Hawk, with some changes to make it unique. First, you've got modifiers to help you create an insane number of variations to your tricks, and you've also got multi-key commands for your tricks. Instead of just a direction and a button, you can pull off more impressive tricks by learning direction and button combos. Plus, since this is a BMX game, you've also got flips and directions to manage. Good stuff, huh? The question is, does the game pull off in practice what is preaches in theory? Almost. Dave Mirra 2 is a black comedy, with some fantastic moments, but enough dark matter to make this less than a cheery gameplay experience.  Gameplay You'll stub your toe, you'll cut an arm on the rough edges in Mirra. Just as with the PlayStation 2 version, there are so many little problems with the controls that you'll start thinking heretical thoughts -- like how you wished you could play the huge, amazing Mirra levels with the Tony Hawk engine. While the overall levels are fun to play, the moment by moment is frustrating, thanks to some weird hiccups in the way the game controls.  At first it's almost hard to describe, other than that things aren't quite right. It's not that the biker controls as slow as the skaters in Grind Session, though there is some of that. It's not that the levels aren't dynamic enough, or that it's too impossible to perform simple tricks -- because Z-Axis has used Tony Hawk as a foundation. It's more about a certain lack of finesse, and some tweaky character control that makes things so frustrating. Getting good air off of an object is never quite logical to gauge, how and why you crash can sometimes have you scratching your head, as will some of the clipping that occurs between you and the scenery, causing you to fall or get caught. In short, it's just not easy to do what you want, when you want, thanks to the way the rider controls, and the lack of polish on the game engine itself.  For instance, the game tends to bring you back almost exactly where you've crashed, so you'll find yourself stuck in awkward situations, caught on objects, or repeating deaths again and again. In the train yards, for instance, I missed a jump over some water, but since the game kept putting me at the edge of the jump, I had to immediately press the brakes or I'd roll down and off into the water, again and again. Turning in the air is much clumsier than it needs to be, as is trying to snap out of riding in reverse. Trying to get out of a bowl cleanly will drive you crazy, and doing combo tricks is more frustrating that it should be because of the delay for certain tricks. While games like Tony Hawk aren't quite as easy to play with an analog pad, with Mirra it's completely unreliable, especially when you've got to rely on diagonals for precise tricks. Unfortunately, while the Xbox controller is great for some games, like Halo, on twitch games like Mirra, it just makes matters worse, even with the digital pad. You can't blame a pad for control problems on Mirra, but it certainly doesn't help things any.  On the other hand, the structure of the game is bigger, more complex, and at times, more satisfying than most games of this type. There's more to do in a level, and you've actually got to fight to find your goals in Mirra 2, rather than just complete a checklist. The list is pretty varied and vast, and while there are some ~find these five dumb objects in the level~ goals, there's also a lot of unique, specific trick and environmental goals to keep you interested. Knock out a few dinosaur teeth, or just grind a baggage carousel and you'll be shaking Z-Axis' collective hand for really thinking about what would be fun to screw around with in a level.  While control isn't everything, on a game like this, it's certainly the most important factor. It's what makes or breaks games of this type, and right now Mirra's still stuck in the ~almost there~ category.  Graphics It's all about the size in Mirra -- huge levels, insane number of grindable/jumpable/rampable objects, interactive elements like trains, other bikers, and even stuff like swamp boats to screw around with... all laid out in huge expanses. After playing most extreme games, it's like leaping from the kiddy pool to an Olympic training ground -- there's no messing around with the levels in this game. They're all crisp and clean, and while there isn't the dynamic, realtime lighting you hope for in every Xbox game, there are some great touches like little blades of grass instead of just simple textures.  If there's a fault, it's that some sections of levels are spread out so much that it's hard to work combos together, though some practice and memorization will help things. I'd rather have the huge swamp to explore rather than a few dense, small buildings any day. Z-Axis really took pride in trying to put an impressive amount of ~wouldn't it be cool if you could...~ things in every level, like a swirly slide in the first level that, yes, you can go down with your bike -- or being able to jump a train. You can explore a swamp, you can ride through a dense metropolis, or maybe just jump off a police car moving through real traffic. The levels and their design are bursting with so much to do that you'll feel guilty for sticking with the ~quests~ given to you, rather than just charging it up.  Animations of the characters are pretty solid, and fantastic when it comes to showing off tricks. The connection between man and metal never looked so good, especially if you pull off some of the wilder tricks available to you. Bikes tend not to react to the environment however, especially stuff like long drops or doing a wall ride, and you'll notice other odd glitches, like finishing a goal before you've even done the trick. It's hard to make believe that you're actually reacting to and with the environment when you get a message saying you've done the last of a set of wall rides for a goal... before your tire even hits the wall. While there's real physics involved with the crashes, they aren't the right physics, which is a completely different thing. When you crash your rider, he'll flop around like a rag doll, with limbs flopping around like he's made out of sawdust and plastic. It's fun to watch, but totally unrealistic. Also, try not to watch the other riders on the levels too much -- you'll catch them generally freaking out with the environment, and getting into some ridiculous crashes. It's a good idea in concept, and in terms of setting up goals for the game, but the actual implementation of other racers in the game feel very, very incomplete.  The level editor is top notch, and filled with so much ridiculous junk to throw in a level that we'll be stunned if anyone actually pushes it to the limit. It's really impressive, and while it's not the fanboy, fully 3D, make your own environment level that we still dream about in our beds, it's the next best thing. You'll be able to create some ridiculously dense levels with it, and what's more, you're not stuck in boring locations like warehouses. You can make your own train yard, using the level's natural environments in with your new additions, and so on. Kudos to Z-Axis for this one... they know what the kids want, which is basically everything.  Sound A solid soundtrack from pals like Ozzy, Tribe Called Quest and Gangstarr make this one a fantastic listen, but like all soundtracks, this one'll repeat itself into oblivion by the time you hit the second level. While this is normally just part of the game, there's always the Soundtrack solution for the Xbox... which is actually not absent from Mirra. Its appears only in the in-game pause menu, but you'll be able to listen to your own tracks if the ones provided don't salt you fries enough.   Sound effects are solid and simple, with everything pumped up pretty load. Chirping birds, the sound of pedals racing over pavement, it's all here on a silver platter for your lobes. Dave Mirra 2 is almost, almost a really fantastic extreme game for the Xbox. It's pretty enough to impress, even if it doesn't show off some of the Xbox's more incredible hardware tricks, it's got a great soundtrack, and some stunning level design. The level editor is the best yet, and the goal structure beat Tony Hawk 3 to the punch. Unfortunately, extreme games are mostly about control, and in that respect Mirra 2 feels unpolished and messy at all the wrong times.From the way the biker controls to the way you react to the environment, the game just fees unfinished in the details. It's not a bad game, but the bad aspects of it will have you wishing that the entire package worked as well as some of the finer moments.", "date": "Nov 13, 2001"}
