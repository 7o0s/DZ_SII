Maybe that was the question on the minds of the developers at Void Star Creations as they set about designing their first game, a hybrid poker-puzzler coming to Xbox Live Arcade this week.     Poker Smash replaces the familiar jewels of Bejeweled, gems of Puzzle Quest and glittery blocks of Super Puzzle Fighter HD Turbo Remix with the face cards of your drunken poker nights. The result is a solid XBLA game with a glossy exterior that puts a snazzy new spin on the puzzle gaming experience without offering anything especially revolutionary to an already crowded field.   The main single-player mode of Poker Smash is built around an upward-scrolling table that reveals cards one row at a time, gradually getting faster as play progresses. Your goal is to arrange the cards into valid poker hands by sliding them horizontally across the table, building combos and gaining multipliers as you're able. We say poker hands, but we're really talking about hands involving only 10, J, Q, K and A, as there are sadly no 2 through 9 cards in Poker Smash.    Void Star expanded on its basic poker/puzzle concept by adding the ability to speed up and slow down the scrolling of the table; bombs that can be strategically placed to clear cards and build combos; and a sampling of extra online and offline modes. In addition to the main mode, there's a timed mode and a puzzle mode that's actually better practice than the game's practice mode.   One of Poker Smash's best qualities is its top-notch presentation. The game has a smooth, snappy HD look and the cards, visual cues and other graphical elements are well-laid-out and easy to read. Menus are easy to navigate and the tutorials are quick and easy to use. The controls are fairly intuitive and precise, and there are unlockable themes to collect as you progress in the game. The sound effects in Poker Smash are well-done, but the music is often distracting--a truly unwelcome trait for a puzzle game.     Poker Smash has a two-player split-screen mode and both ranked and un-ranked online multiplayer modes that pit players against one another to battle over a community pot of poker chips. An optional ~dealer~ function also allows players to send cards to their opponent's table when they match certain combinations.    Unfortunately, the online multiplayer mode only shows the action on your table, not your opponents'. That means the only tell you have about their progress is the chip count displayed on your screen. The online multiplayer is there in Poker Smash, but it doesn't shine like the game's showy graphics.   If you already have a stable of great puzzle games in your Xbox Live Arcade lineup, there's really not much reason to pick up Poker Smash, especially if you've already gotten your table gaming fix with Texas Hold 'Em. But if you're a sucker for eye candy and you're looking for a twist on the line-'em-up-and-clear-'em genre, Poker Smash is a well-crafted game with a good variety of modes and options.", "date": "Feb 6, 2008"}
