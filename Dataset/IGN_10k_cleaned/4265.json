Namco, creator of some of the finest coin-ops ever, have assembled seven of their classics here, with one upgrade.  Check it: Pac-Man, Galaga, Toy Pop, Rally X, New Rally X, Star Destroyer, Bosconian, and the aforementioned Pole Position are all here, and are all coded straight off the original boards, which means they're absolutely arcade perfect. There's also a museum mode on the disc, which lets you wander through a virtual museum of exhibits on the games, their original arcade cabinets, and their history. The museum mode loads a little slowly, unfortunately, but is essential for anyone wishing to know more about these ~golden years.~  These games really have stood the test of time. It's interesting to note that even though these games are graphically primitive when compared to anything we have today, they're still incredibly fun. Programmers take note: gameplay will always be more important than graphics, no matter how cool they look. Damn straight.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
