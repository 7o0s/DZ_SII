They made you feel like you were playing. Maybe it's the old school style. Maybe it's the elegant simplicity. Maybe it's just the little green men, but Introversion's newest game Darwinia made me feel good this whole week. The art style is awesome, the action is addictive, the strategy is fun, and the presentation and feel you get from playing it is undeniably charming and different than anything we get nowadays. This game is about being a game and having a good time. I love Darwinia. Honestly, it's not without problems, but it's been pretty easy for me to scoot past them simply because I was too busy enjoying myself.   What is Darwinia? It's a virtual theme park created by Dr. Sepulveda, a fictional computer scientist that tried to enter into the computer market in the 80's and failed miserably. After accidentally stumbling across quantum computing, he created a new form of AI. One that learned, grew, adapted, and, most importantly, had a soul. Each Darwinian was infused with virtual DNA that upon death was transmitted back to a central hub where their memories and experiences were taken sorted and then put back together along with other memories into a new soul that was then transmitted down to Darwinia again to create a new life. After 20 years of work, thousands of generations of Darwinians had evolved into a new kind of life. Dr. Sepulveda's dream was that these creatures would one day be able to fend for themselves and live in a virtual domain without their creator.    Unfortunately for the Darwinians, their existence was thrown into the crapper when a virus infected the system, converting many of the Darwinian souls into viruses. Dr. Sepulveda was barely able to construct some shields to protect one small part of the world... which is where you find yourself when the game loads up. There's no opening menu, just an opening sequence informing you that you've found your way into Darwinia when Dr. Sepulveda pops onto the screen and asks for help in clearing out the mess. It's almost akin to the way Half-Life 2 presents itself as an integrated experience in order to take you out of the real world and start caring about the problem at hand. That problem, in this case, is saving the cute little Darwinians from utter annihilation at the hands of an evil virus.   All of this is presented simply and perfectly. From the integrated opening sequence to the manual that comes with all appropriate information and a great mock article about the bizarre Dr. Sepulveda. It's entertaining, fun, and creates a strange sense of realism in such an unreal environment. Suddenly, after getting your feet wet in the first mission, you care about these funny little sprite creatures and want to save them. The presentation just simply carries through the entire experience. From the different loading screens that pop up every time the game is started to the brilliant retro art style that makes Darwinia so unique in a market dominated by spiffy new engines, Introversion has crafted a fine piece of entertainment.     Yes, Darwinia is weird. For the most part people around the office who hadn't heard of the game (which was all of them) didn't really know what to think. Explaining the premise seemed to help a little, but it's a bit hard to really explain the love of a game that has such a different art style that people just plain aren't used to seeing nowadays. It's almost hard to think that something without hundreds of thousands of polygons on the screen and highly detailed textures could be so successful visually. But even without the flash and pomp that you find in so many PC titles now, this sucker has style up the wazoo. It's highly colorful retro gaming bursting into 3D at high resolutions. It's art, really, not simple cookie cutter models and style in most titles nowadays, and that makes a big difference. Even our eyes need a new flavor of candy from time to time. The only problem with this art is the fact that it can slow down badly in later missions when a lot of Darwinians go to war. It's surprising, considering the rig it was running on how little really appears to be happening graphically.    The art style isn't the only bit that's fun. Introversion has created a game that's very simple on the surface but hides a crazy mix of genres and styles at its core. It's part god game, part strategy game, part action game, and part retro arcade game. The god game comes from your power to create programs to save the Darwinians, their reverence and obedience to your decisions, and the fact that these little ~people~ see all this stuff as an act of power and mystery from an unseen hand (there's more to that in the story, but I don't want to kill any fun). You give orders from above they rush to carry out your almighty whim.   At the same time, you'll actually draw symbols to create programs, something that hearkens to both Black & White and Arx Fatalis spell systems, which can then be placed on the field. The simple strategy comes from deciding when to place them and where. You can only have a certain number of programs running at once so making smart decisions is important. It's also possible to increase the level of each of the programs at your disposal. Simply hold down the ALT key to access the menu, move the mouse to the left, and choose a program. Dr. Sepulveda will then begin work to upgrade the feature for you. These include weapons programs, upgrades for Darwinians so they can carry weapons (they will suddenly become very important) and space for more programs to run at once.   The action and retro gaming come from placing squad programs onto the field and taking control over them. At that point, it's almost like a game of Centipede on 'roids. When in control of a squad, you'll actually have to aim and fire both lasers and secondary weapons at any enemy viruses to clear a safe path for your people. The virus creatures are anything from single wormlike creatures that hug the ground to much larger centipede and flying centipedes that attack at will. Both spiders (bugs of the system corrupted further) and spore generators drop eggs which the virus will try to fertilize with lost Darwinian souls. It makes both killing the creatures and collecting the fallen souls (which are dropped after a virus creature has been destroyed) very important.     All of the elements mix together so seamlessly it's like they were always meant to be as one like Twix or Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. But even with all of the fun and frolic, there are a few things that could have been improved. Most importantly is pathfinding AI. Units frequently get stuck in parts of an island and simply can't find their way around. Very specific patterns of movement need to be set up using upgraded Darwinians named officers that can give orders which can be a hassle, but for the most part, won't cause a problem. The armour troop transports/gun emplacements are the worst culprit. They'll forget what they're doing frequently and just sit there because of another vehicle in the area. This can make a coordinated attack difficult. When you've got a bunch of Darwinians flowing through the pipe into the area and then the extra troops don't show up with the gun emplacements, your whole plan can go to poop. In the last mission this can be especially vexing and can actually make it impossible to finish without resetting the area since there's no traditional save structure.Even with the minor problems (including some stability issues), Darwinia is great gaming. It makes me smile. My eyes rejoice at the sight of it. I found very little not to like and the things I had problems with were easily forgivable because of the simple interface that makes most mistakes pretty easy to correct. The game is both simple fun and a unique blend of wonderful.  It reminds me of the good old days when creativity reigned over marketing ploys and safe choices. Darwinia is a great argument for keeping games in the hands of creative developers with good ideas.", "date": "Mar 25, 2005"}
