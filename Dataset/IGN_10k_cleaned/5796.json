That clunker was rendered nearly unplayable by bad control and shoddy framerates, a real downer for anybody buying into it hoping for a return to yesteryear's best beat-'em-up.   Bandai learned a lot from Double Dragon EX -- and it helps that they have a new gen of phones to work with, too. Double Dragon EX is infinitely more enjoyable, a return to form for the franchise. The game is a cool mix of elements from a few Double Dragon titles, but the heroes remain the same. Jimmy Lee and Billy are changed with kicking butt from one side of your handset to the other, laying fierce punches on an endless stream of bad dudes.   Control is a little better in Double Dragon EX, especially because the game grants you access to a far greater stable of moves. You can jump kick enemies, uppercut them into the next screen, or elbow them to their knees. Now, many of these moves require multiple button inputs. Some gamers might find this frustrating, but fortunately the game allows you to control the speed of play. If you're having trouble with some combos, slow it down until you get the hang of the required inputs.   Series fans will certainly be pleased with how the game looks -- Double Dragon EX is total 1980s. The sprites are ripped right out the arcades, complete with full cartoon-y detail. The levels will be familiar to followers, too. Several classic tracks have been juiced into the game, as well as many sound effects -- however you cannot listen to them both at the same time. Pity.  Double Dragon EX may offer some complicated controls, but with a little practice, most mobile gamers should get the combos right within a few games. If you can text, you can play Double Dragon EX. The reproduction of several play elements make's this sometime of a fan's dream. I wish the game was a little longer, but for a few bucks, beat-'em-up fans will have a good time with Double Dragon EX.", "date": "Jun 8, 2005"}
