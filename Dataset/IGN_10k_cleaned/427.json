{"name": "The X-Files: The Game", "name_review": "X-Files: The Game", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/19/x-files-the-game", "text": "Developed with input from Chris Carter and Ten Thirteen Productions, The X-Files videogame is a point-and-click FMV graphical adventure where the player takes on the role of field agent Craig Willmore, not agents Fox Mulder or Dana Scully. Mulder and Scully are missing and Willmore has been assigned by Assistant Director Skinner to find them. Overall, the story has a reasonable amount mystery and suspense, and it would make a decent episode if it were part of the TV series. The problem is that there's really only about 30 minutes of a quality ~story~ in the game and it gets spread out over a four to six hour videogame.   Fans of the TV series will be pleased to know that many of the characters from the show make cameos in the game. The player will encounter individuals like X, AD Skinner, Mulder, Scully, The Lone Gunmen and even the cigarette smoking man. While The X-Files fans will be excited to see these characters, most will feel a bit short-handed by the fact that neither Mulder nor Scully appear in the game enough - aside from the opening they don't make their appearance until three quarters of the way through the game.   Gameplay The general interface of The X-Files is the same as most graphical adventure games. You move the cursor around the screen with the directional pad or analog stick and the graphic of the cursor will change when you are able to perform an action. The basic actions that you can perform include navigating, checking details, executing actions, and conversing with people. You can also use various items that you find and collect throughout the game. There are also a few action sequences which require you to shoot people or to execute tasks within a time limit.  One of the cool control features of the game is the ability to automatically jump to hot spots and navigation points by either holding down the R2, L1, or R1 buttons. This makes it much easier to move around the screen since the digital pad tends to move the cursor around too slowly and the analog control is a bit unsteady.  Graphics Most of the video in the game is letterboxed and takes up about half of the screen. The FMV of the letterboxed clips are fairly clean and run at a smooth framerate.  The video clips that are full screen aren't as clean, but still look fine and run smoothly. Most of the areas are dark and shadowy, but that isn't a negative because it perfectly fits the look and feel of the game.  Sound Since the game uses many of the actors from the TV series, the quality of the voice acting is top notch. Even the actors that aren't in The X-Files give a first-class performance in the video sequences. For the most part, the sound mainly consists of background type noises, but terrific mood-creating music will chime in at important parts of the game. I'm a big fan of The X-Files (following it religiously for about the past five years), so I was interested in checking out this game. The game has a lot of cool stuff that I really liked, but it just didn't please me overall - as a gamer or as an X-Files fan. The story wasn't bad, but I would have rather just sat down and watched it.", "date": "Nov 19, 1999"}
