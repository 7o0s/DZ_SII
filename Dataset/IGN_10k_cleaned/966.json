Take a look at Die Hard Trilogy - great movies, great game. What happened? Independence Day for the PlayStation possesses no redeeming qualities.   While the movie could at least fall back on spectacular visual effects, the game doesn't have this luxury. The texture-mapped polygons are extremely grainy and undefined, and unappealing to look at, let alone navigate around. There's also a serious clipping problem which can cause your ship to become trapped in solid objects. What's up with that?  As far as gameplay is concerned,  like the movie, it lacks depth. Sure, there are a variety of ships to choose from but they all move the same. What is most annoying is the lack of flying physics. You can fly straight into the side of a cliff and you only loose two points off your life meter. Totally unrealistic and unappealing to the eye.  As we were trying to pilot the planes around the grotesquely textured 3D environments, we thought to ourselves, ~How could this game get any worse?~ The movie is worth checking out, but the game isn't.", "date": "Apr 24, 1997"}
