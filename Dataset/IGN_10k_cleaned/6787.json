ElectroBrain grabbed the international publishing rights for Hudson's Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth, but forgot to tell anyone about it. Even several major retailers weren't sure whether they would receive any copies of the game until about a day before its release.The good news is that Star Soldier is far from the heap of crap that Hudson and Electro-Brain's last release (Dual Heroes) was. The game arrives as the first scrolling overhead shooter for the system and helps broadening the N64's lineup. The bad news is that we can think of 20 Super NES shooters that are more impressive and innovative -- even to this day.GameplayDeveloped by a Hudson team of videogame veterans (the project leader also headed up the development of the old NES Star Soldier), the 64-bit sequel follows closely in the footsteps of its 10-year-old NES daddy. The game is mostly played from an overhead perspective similar to the Raiden series, only this time around backgrounds are polygonal instead of flat bitmaps.Players choose from three ships, each varying in mobility and weaponry, and head out on an assault on the Zeograd Army. There are seven stages all together, with three bonus stages, ranging from space based battle zones to attack runs over intergalactic oceans. In addition to regular shield and weapons power-ups, you can earn bonus ~hit combos~ if you destroy more than 100 enemies.Besides the Normal Mode, which follows a storyline, a Time Attack mode (in which the player must get as high a score possible within a time limit) adds much needed replay value. Called ~Caravan Mode~ in Japan, this addition has made the original NES shooter a popular centerpiece for large-scale videogame contests in Japan. Unfortunately, it doesn't save Star Soldier from being only slightly above average.It would be fitting to describe the gameplay as brutally retro. The new 3D look helps differentiate Soldier from the old 16-bit shooters, but the gameplay is nothing new. As a matter of fact, games like Axelay or even Raiden have more innovative features and are still more fun to play than Star Soldier. Enemies fly onto the screen in predictable patterns, there is virtually zero interaction between objects and your ship, weapons upgrades are done by the numbers (wooah, a smart bomb!), and the game even lacks the fun two-player mode that defined many of the shooters in the early '90s.This is not to say that the game is bad, but Star Soldier just doesn't have what it takes to resurrect the overhead shooting genre on the next generation platforms.GraphicsStar Soldier's presentation is very much in line with Mode 7 style SNES overhead shooters. Hudson used polygonal backdrops to add a bit of a 3D feel, which does indeed lead to some spectacular rotational effects once in a while. But when compared to other titles on the N64, Star Soldier looks hopelessly dated in the presentation department. Textures are brightly colored, but much too simple and boring, and the cookie-cutter ~'80s sci-fi~ architecture won't leave a lasting impression. Some of the bosses and weapons effects are exciting, but considering the fixed perspective, they could have been much more spectacular. Hudson didn't even attempt to implement any type of lighting (neither real-time nor the simple texture pre-lighing), which makes the game come across as flat and dull. Still, at least it's smooth.SoundAgain, it seems like time froze and Hudson's sound designers and composers simply used the same samples they had in the office since 1988. It does instill a bit of nostalgia, but this game was conceived as a full-fledged sequel, not a re-release of a classic shooter. The sound effects are decent, but uneventful.When I first saw Square's Einhander on PlayStation, I was hoping for a revival of one of my favorite genres from the 16-bit days. Even better, only weeks later Hudson announced that it was bringing back the NES classic Star Soldier for N64. I was excited -- until I got to play the game. Seriously, play R-Type, Twinbee, Parodius, Axelay, Raiden. Each one of these titles is more original and Axelay even looks better graphically than Star Soldier. An embarassing feat, considering that the latter runs on the SNES... The bottomline is this: If you're itching to play an old-style overhead shooter, give this a rent. Just be warned that it's dreadfully uninspired and gets old quickly. I wouldn't buy it for more than $20. Shooting fans should stick with Dezaemon, a Japan-only N64 app that lets you create your own Star Soldier style shooters.", "date": "Jan 21, 1999"}
