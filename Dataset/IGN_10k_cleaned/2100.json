The Long Island, NY-based console dinosaur was first out with Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX on PlayStation, but it's game was followed by the better, but much later Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX. As it stands, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 feels better than its predecessor in control and speed, it's enormous in size and scope, easy to control but hard to master, and a very likeable first effort for the series on PS2. It's also got this amazingly kick-ass soundtrack that gels perfectly with the game. But despite its major overhauls and improvements, it still feels rushed, unfinished, and in some cases, poorly tuned. It's worth buying, as long as you're aware it's a far-from-perfect game.   Gameplay  The first thing that most extreme sports gamers should notice right off the bat is the controls. In Mirra 2, Acclaim's BMX team (Z-Axis) enables players to select from the former Mirra controls, or the intuitively perfect Tony Hawk controls. For me, it was easy to choose between the two (T. Hawk, thank you very much). What this means instantly is that if you have played Tony Hawk, Grind Session, or Mat Hoffman, you'll instantly get to grips with Mirra, with X as the jump function at the lip of any surface. Dave Mirra opens itself up to a slightly wider audience because of this, and in my opinion, is a better game because of it, too.   Second, the controls are instantly responsive and relatively tight. In the beginning players can select as many as 14 players, including Dave Mirra, Ryan Nyquist, Troy McMurray, Todd Lyons, John ~Luc-E~ Englebert, Mike Laird, Rick Moliterno, Tim Mirra, Kenan Harkin, Leigh Ramsdell, Joey Garcia, Scott Wirch, Colin Mackay, and Zach Shaw. With whomever one selects, the response with each rider is instant and the lag time one felt in Mirra on PlayStation has all but vanished (some other dilemmas stand in the way, but I'll come to those in just a second).   The magnet-like rails from the PS versions have been replaced by more subtle and more realistic rail moves in Mirra 2. Players can perform as many as 1,500 trick combinations, based on the game's modification system, including handfuls of rails, backflips, wall rides, and dozens of combination possibilities. The S.I.K. (Skeletal Inverse Kinetics) system, is back. SIK provides for some excellent bails, but is still suspect more than 80% of the time during those very bails. The riders' bodies do some amazing things when falling, but in-game slowdown is definitely apparent, and inconsistent with the rest of (well, most of) the rest of the game.    The game setup is pretty standard as extreme games go these days, with players opening up new areas and better bikes by kicking off big combos and earning lots of points. And, in this game ~respect~ is everything. As riders increase their respect by earning points from killer tricks and combos, they in turn are rewarded by better, faster bikes -- and further access to the levels and the non-player characters. The idea of increasing your ability, based on a better bike, is a little off kilter in my mind, since the player himself should be rewarded based on their individual skill with increased personal stats, not a better bike.   In any case, players can pull of their tricks in several modes of play. Aside from ProQuest, the game offers up Freeride mode, Session mode, (two-person) Multiplayer mode, and Park Editor. It's important to note that the Park Editor is one of the best create-a-park areas I have seen. It's loaded with primary and secondary objects to build your park, and it's quick, intuitive, and easy to build parks with; in fact, you can see quite quickly how well the actual courses are designed after you build your first park. You've got to try this Park Editor.    But it's the ProQuest, much like a Career mode, that's the heart of the game: it sets you up with a bike and a single course. First, you earn enough respect to talk to the locals, non-player characters that ride around and challenge you to different goals, and then you face the Amateur, Pro, and Hardcore challenges, all of which reward you with different things. The non-player characters (the other pros in the game that you didn't pick) are a nice touch. They ride around in various parts of the game, and offer goals up, and if you watch them carefully, they might even teach you how to pull off the harder ones. Also, they're definitely part of the game, and fully interactive -- you may get creamed by one or run into a head-on collision with one if you're not careful.   The goals are organized and well structured. Players must learn things like learning how to Wall Ride to Manual to simple grinding, each offering up its own reward. You can open up all of the levels without ever performing the Hardcore Challenges, but for those who just can't put the game down, the replay value of those challenges is there. I never had any major problems with these goals, but occasionally, the size of the levels -- which by the way is a huge plus for this game -- actually hindered my ability to find things, such as ladders and beach balls, for instance. After enough riding around, I did succeed, of course.   As a matter of fact, one of the best aspects of the game is the level size. Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 is not just huge, it's monstrous. Half of the fun in the game is simply riding around and exploring. And the different goals play into this very aspect. As aforementioned, some of the goals are to locate items and hit them, such as giant beach balls, or even to fast plant on things such as food stands and well-placed clocks. This is not always easy when the level appears to be miles in square feet (or at least they seem like miles of square feet). The scope of the levels adds a permeating sense of size, and in turn offers up an impressive set of seemingly endless goals. Classic levels such as Woodward Camp are here (but far more massive scale), and brand new levels, based in fantasy and reality, such as the TrainYards, Galloon Park, and Devil's Peak are imaginative, silly but desirable places to ride.    I like these levels, not just because of their size but because of their subtleness. What seemed like a simple wall at first sight is actually a wall-ride that leads into a rail into something else. What initially appears as a harmless sewer is a nerve center for major air and tons of gaps to fill. What once was a mere electrical wire transforms into a Pro Challenge Rail across Madison Street in a downtown area over moving traffic. And the sight of a cop car is no longer signal to stay cool, but rather an uppity little challenge to jump it for ~respect.~ The levels are well designed, not with stunning genius, but with a subtle, reserved manner, an almost subconscious architecture, that always requires players to take a second or even third look at every square foot. And while many of the long combo lines aren't brilliantly imagined (in fact the game is very basic in this respect), many of the lines, especially the gaps, are quite challenging and imaginative. And, there are tons of them hidden all over every course.   My biggest concern with Mirra 2 is not rooted in its control, or the size or design of the levels. Instead, it's with the game's lack of bug-testing, tuning, and several small, troublesome areas that raise a suspect eye. For instance, in many areas of the game, after having bailed, your rider respawns on a slanted surface, and instantly crashes off his bike. Other times, riders respawn right in front of moving cars, or on steep stairs, where it's impossible to do anything but to bite it, wait, and hope to get out of the area sometime in next 10-15 seconds. In fact, several times, my rider respawned inside solid polygonal objects, like rocks, concrete walls, and hillsides, which I luckily could ride out off, only to see my rider bail and respawn again.    Because of these kinds of problems, along with sudden seizures in framerate, I'm always a little worried that something might happen while I'm riding that could ruin my run. The framerate, which is good and high most of the time, does a few things that remind me of the first Mirra -- and the problems it had. The 3D engine that Z-Axis created still seems to pose problems when players ride over certain surfaces, such as stairs and slanted sections. In Galloon Park for instance, while pulling off the Arched Gate Rail Challenge, the game slows down 90% of the time I'm about to crash over the stairs. Sometimes it's slow, sometimes, it's intermittent, but it's almost always there, slowing down, stuttering, and annoying. It's not just graphic, it does indeed get in the way of the gameplay.   Also, depending on your opinion, you may either love or hate Mirra 2's camera angles. The riders here bump into objects and then move backward. In these cases, usually in small areas, the camera turns around to face the rider head-on, and players are required to double tap to spin around to get back on track. I didn't mind the camera that much, in fact, I just got used to it, but with some people, it's frustrating, and even worse, it actually makes them sick. It works much the same way the camera does in Spyro The Dragon, only you have no control over it. Yeah, it can be maddening.   Graphics  Mirra 2 looks good: It's not a stunning, next-wave piece of God-like code, but it's far from poop. Again, one of the most impressive aspects of this game is its monstrous levels. They're just huge, and their size impresses the eye to such a degree that one is convinced the game is good looking. It's a neat effect. The visual design of the levels benefits greatly from several aspects, too, especially their radical differences. You never really notice it, but the textures are rather simple, even plain. The hard darks and copper colors in the TrainYard level are a far cry from the light, Mario-esque primary colors found in the closed down amusement park level, Galloon Park. Even the Airport Garage looks largely different from the Commercial District. And then of course, there is Devil's Peak, which is sandy, earthen and really quite a stunning level to just wander about in. In all, the levels are crafted with a good eye on color and shape, and they achieve the right level of believability.    The high-resolution graphics are marred by the occasional drop in framerate, and by two other areas of weakness, wherein aliasing and flickering seams appear. Thus, the large, imaginative levels aren't perfectly topped off with a pristine frosting, and aliasing problems add another distraction, to make matters worse. While other graphic problems, such as pop-up and fade-in are noticeable, they're only worth mentioning as a side note, because Z-Axis just about nailed these aspects in the game. Yes, you can see pop-up and fade-in, and in fact, there is a certain level of problematic collision detection stuff going on, too, but the former doesn't effect gameplay at all, and the latter is noticeable but when weighed in with the amount of fun you'll have, it's relatively harmless.   The riders themselves are highly detailed, and you can instantly recognize the pros for who they are. Dave Mirra looks like Dave Mirra, Ryan Nyquist looks like Ryan Nyquist, and Troy McMurray looks like himself, etc., etc. The bikes are of solid framework, too. There isn't too much in the way of pyrotechnics here, so the little things you may notice are more noticeable then normal. For instance, while grinding the arcing sparks that fly off are cool looking and believable. The levels are generally filled with moveable, breakable, interactive sections, too, such as a fall-through second story floor in the TrainYards, breakable stands in Galloon Park, breakable awnings in the Commercial District, and the like. And in every level, players see moving vehicles, all of which can be jumped of pegged off.    Sound  Hats off to the folks who picked these classic, perfectly suited tunes. The 10 songs that range from rap to heavy metal to hip hop to straight rock are exquisitely picked. Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 has an absolutely kick-ass soundtrack that strangely gels the disparate likes of old (but hard rocking) farts such as Ozzy Osbourne (a live version of ~Paranoid~) and The Cult (The frickin' Cult!, which brings ~She Sells Sanctuary~) with today's more hip bands such as Sublime, Tribe Called Quest, and the ever-popular anti-establishment band, Rage Against the Machine (with ~Wake Up~). I never much liked the Cult's She Sells Sanctuary, but in this game, I love it. It's perfect, ridiculously so. Also, who ever though that grinding and 360-ing to Sublime would feel so right?   As for the sound effects, they're all good and they do their jobs.  Perhaps the most memorable sound effect of them all however is the simple whir of your bike as it speeds along during a quite section of the game. It's a perfect sound for those concentrating on harmonizing themselves with their peddling machines.    Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 has problems, but just like the first one, there is something in it that just hooks me into playing it until the night turns into day. The game feels solid and responsive, the controls are relatively tight and the bikes are fast, unlike in the previous games. Z-Axis took a lot of effort to break free of the problems in the first game, such as overly magnetized railings, slow riding, bad framerates, and small levels. In almost every aspect, this game stands way above its former iterations -- especially in the design and scope of the levels.  And while there are some truly monumental bails in this game, it's too bad the SIK system is still a little frazzled when it comes to shuttering slowdowns and framerate drops. I can't compare this to any other game on the system because there are none to compare it to as of yet (specifically Activision's Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2), but as a solid first effort in the series on PS2, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2 is a good, respectable game with more good points than bad ones. Let's just hope that Acclaim doesn't simply quickly produce another follow-up Mirra 3 that merely adds more levels, but instead fixes the problems in this one to produce a superior third version.", "date": "Sep 4, 2001"}
