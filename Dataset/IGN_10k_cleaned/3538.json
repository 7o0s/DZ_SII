The perfect example of this is its first, current-generation racing game Auto Modellista, a cel-shaded, online racer. Designed in the vein of urban street racing, Capcom's stylish racer enables regular folk to take standard model cars and then customize, personalize and specialize them to make a personal statement, but moreover, to look extremely cool.    With mixed to less than emphatic reviews in Japan, Auto Modellista has both been loved and loathed, and now that it's arrived here in North America the same seems to hold true. People seem to either love or hate it. Capcom's innovative racer is no doubt cool looking, incredibly plentiful with customization options and flashy throughout its core. But is it a great or even a good racing game? The answer is not as easy as are most other games to judge, nor as easy as I would like it to be.   Gameplay  The answer, in fact, is mixed. Auto Modellista is an arcade-style and cel-shaded racer that offers players a healthy and robust racing experience, but all of its excellence comes with some relatively serious caveats. While it offers superb levels of customization to nearly every aspect of a car possible, and functions well online, many gamers will simply not like what can best be described as the awkward, slide-prone controls. I'll get more throroughly into that soon enough.   The North American version of Capcom's flashy, attractive racer offers numerous changes and improvements over its Japanese cousin, including three new courses (nine in all, eight normal and one hidden), nine new American cars (for a grand total of 69 real-world, licensed vehicles), more kinds of races, a slick, all-new opening video, more replay options, ~improved handling and physics,~ and additional musical selections.    Auto Modellista is both an offline and online racer. Offline players can get to grips with the Arcade mode, a standard enter and race scenario, Garage Life, which is the Career modes of the game, and VJ and Theater, an arena enabling players to watch, edit and direct race replays of their choice. The game's Network mode enables players to connect online via Sony's Network Adaptor (with a broadband connection) and, using Sega's SNAP technology, vie against as many as seven other racers simultaneously.    You'll find good replays with lots of options.  Customization  The heart of the game is couched in the Garage Life and Network modes. Garage Life offers players the ability to start a career and progress through as many as seven-plus levels before completing the game with one vehicle. It's a unique and robust mode that heavily emphasizes the modern urban racers' desires to customize their vehicles to an extreme degree. It's an amazing amount of fun in a sort of RPG way. Auto Modellista takes the car collection concept from Gran Turismo: A-spec and brings it one step further, enabling players to dress up their vehicles so that they can sit back proudly and admire their vehicles, or show them off online.    Once a vehicle is selected from the 69 available cars (many of which are locked in the beginning), players can begin their endless assault of customizing. For starters, the superficial aspects of the car can be modified easily and quickly. One can change the paint color, add various styles of racing stripes, change the fenders, foils, spoilers, wings, side panels, hubcap styles and more. If you select something and then decide to change your mind later, it's easy to change. The whole modification system is like a snap-on tool set with totally modified and interchangeable parts; it's essentially easier than Legos.     What's also nice is that none of these parts cost a dime. They're all free. This might raise some eyebrows for those who have been accustomed to the monetary systems in Gran Turismo and similar racers, but Auto Modellista has its own system. A player can't instantly just open up everything: Winning races earns new goods. More specifically, winning races earns far more valuable parts, prized items, improvements and it unlocks faster and cooler cars, all of which are entirely necessary to win on the later levels. A typical race earns players two to three emails (an email system in Garage Life educates and explains driving techniques, hints for specific courses, and more), two to three items, and winning the final race in a level almost always unlocks a new vehicle.    Once you have satisfied your every desire to trick out your new baby's exterior, you can then save the car in a garage or sub-garage and, if you want, start over again with dozens of new cars. Even the garage itself is visually customizable. Selecting from three garage styles, players can place and store (save) their car or take it out for a test drive or start racing. After players successfully win a number of races, an endless wave of items are unlocked -- shelves, posters, oil cans, batteries, radios, the list of items you earn can all be select and placed in your Garage which, within only a few races, can take a tremendously personal look.   Once the dressing is complete, players can then instantly alter their internal car parts. The modification system is explained in the menu system itself, and includes alteration and improvement options for wheel types, brakes, suspension, muffler, turbine (if your car is turbine compatible), computer, engine, final gear, and weight reduction. Many of these aspects can be selected and then altered using a slide bar, while others can be upgraded. For instance, from the get-go players can reduce the weight of the car to say, level 2. But the menu bars show a selection for a secret weight reduction, which is clearly awarded after beating a certain race. In fact, to get every single hidden and locked goody, you have to beat every race in the game. The American version offers an additional 100-plus tuning parts.  The customization menus are very convenient, too.  Players can alter their cars in the Garage or in the race mode, so that they can adjust their settings to that particular race. An example where this is necessary is racing in the rain and the having to race on a dirt course or an uphill course, each of which require modifications to the brakes, tire types, suspension, and gear ratios, among other things.   Then, once they're finished with the ~make up~ phase, players can start racing. In Garage Life, players progress by beating levels, of which there are seven-plus in all. The amount of races in each level varies, and each one comes with a star rating, determining its difficulty level. The courses are almost all street style races, mixing in uphill and downhill races, races in the rain, a few dirt tracks, and lots of local Japanese street tracks.    There is no doubt about it, there is an excessive amount of customization to be had here.  Control and Handling  The racing itself is where people differ in their opinions. Being an arcade racing game, which by definition means easy to pick up and play, Auto Modellista is not ideal. The American version is more slide, or ~drift~ prone than the Japanese version, and it takes some getting used to -- but more to the point, it takes constant adjustment. You have to get used to these controls. You have to learn how to manage slides, to overcome all of the cars' tendencies to drift in sharp turns, and to counter balance that tendency with constant customization. The fact is, this game is inherently not a smooth and easy arcade racer, instead it's intrinsically tempered with overly drift-prone mechanics.    Is it broken? I don't think so. Is it meant to be like a street rally racing? I suspect so. In being weirdly drift-heavy, it's not a racer everyone will like. It's something that will either grow on you, or it just won't. Is it fun? Depends on whom you ask. Within time, for those who stick with it, this anime racer is very rewarding. The relatively steep learning curve can indeed be climbed and conquered, and for those who put the time in, there are excessive rewards, i.e. incredibly fast cars, tons of items, all sorts of cool parts to modify your car and more.    What do I think? I'm a long-suffering knucklehead who likes a challenge, and so I'm willing to put in the time. But I'll tell you this: I spent several very focused hours seriously considering just exactly what Capcom was trying to do with these controls. When it comes to drifting, I prefer proper rally racing, the Colin McRae Rally series, the old PS Rally Cross game, or even Daytona USA. It's Sega's arcade racer, Daytona USA, that I think Capcom is trying to mimic to a certain degree but doesn't quite succeed in doing.    Being the kind of arcade racer it is, Auto Modellista has its strengths and weaknesses. Like Gran Turismo and Ridge Racer, the cars don't take damage. So you can drive like a lunatic, crash into walls, objects and other cars, all without consequence. Well, the one consequence is that you slow down, but oftentimes you can actually bounce off walls and other cars instead of actually driving well, which is essentially cheating. It's not technically evil, but what I don't like about this fault is one's ability to actually drive poorly and still reap the rewards. I can speed into a moderate turn, bounce off the walls and use that momentum to keep going, while the other racers properly slow down and fall behind. Online, this behavior is really annoying, and it can ruin a skillfully raced game.    Secondly, if you get into a spin out, it's an incredible pain in the butt trying to get out of it. The reverse function is a little awkward, and it takes just a little too long to get things going. The AI is also extremely unbalanced. In the early levels it's easy to beat. But in the mid to later levels, it's tough to gauge. Sometimes you can smoke by a car and maintain a very high speed only to see it come speeding up behind you. How did that car get so fast all of a sudden? For the most part, the AI is solid though. On the Rokko Downhill course, you'll see the AI make its own mistakes. Cars will pile up, spin out and smash into walls, and well, having done that myself, I enjoy seeing the AI doing it, and it gives me the feeling that there is some balance to the opponent cars.     Online Racing  The other aspect that Auto Modellista has going for it is online play, which works well. Using the Network Adaptor and a broadband connection, players can join in with as many as seven other gamers in online racing. The combination of highly customizable cars and online play is a mighty addictive formula, and it's similar in a way to the formula offered in Rockstar's Midnight Club II.    From our time online, the racing quickly separated the boys from the men. When we played, the connections were relatively smooth and enough courses were available for some variation. After entering the Lobby and setting up your account, you can choose from a few types of racing, or you can watch races.    But the key to playing online is to build your racer, customize and tune it, and to get good before getting online. If you just hop online fresh and unprepared, you will get your ass kicked. The race will end before you even reach the finish line, and it will provide an unsatisfying experience. Instead, I suggest playing though Auto Modellista at least once, trying several different cars and finding the one you like and are best at, and then going online to for a good race. That will provide the best experience.    Graphics  Overall, Auto Modellista is an excellent looking game. It's unique in its approach, and it's the first cel-shaded racer on the PS2. Everything looks fresh and different. The style has this bright, vivid affect that really makes the game pop. Capcom has opted to create an animation style ~speed~ affect that appears in misty white lines, which increase as they spread around the car in the attempt to create a sense of speed. I liked the affect, but a lot of on-lookers here thought they looked stupid. The only problem with them is that they don't seem to jive with the speed of the car. In other words, they make the car look like it's going faster than the relative speed of the car with respect to the ground and the walls around it. So, if you just look at the wind effect, you feel like you're going very fast, but if you look at the walls and ground, you get a different feeling. It's a little artificial, but it's cool in my book, even if it doesn't quite work out.   The cel-shading works better in some places than others. For instance, in the night levels (Rainy Street Challenge Cup), the graphics lose that vivid quality, and the whole effect is relatively nullified. Here, the rain is quite cool, coming down hard and bouncing off the cars as they drive. But in the day levels, such as Ura Rokko Hill Climb Challenge Cup and Akagi Hill Climb Challenge Cup, the cel-shading really shines through. On the latter of these two levels, there is a significant level of graphic effects, such as realtime lighting, which dramatically effects shadowing and glaring, while driving through piles of bronzed autumn leaves gives one a distinct feeling of realism.    The good sense of speed is mightily enhanced with the later, speedier unlockable cars.   Despite the cel shading effect, good lighting and excellent and easy-to-use menu systems, much of the game's graphics are surprisingly average. The car models aren't enhanced much from the cel-shading effects, and in some cases such as in the Dodge Viper, the heavy cel-shade outlining actually diminishes the car's fine, sleek features. The effect works better on heavier models such as the Ford Mustang, for example. There is very little slowdown, but I did notice some annoying aliasing here and there as well as some artifacts floating around.     Sound  Capcom has definitely gone the way of Gran Turismo with regard to the menu music. The clean, jazzy theme is a livelier, more danceable one that Polyphony's tune (which I still love dearly), but I like this one a lot. The music during the game is good too. The combination of jazz, rock, and mixtures thereof are a little generic but it's nice to get some completely unlicensed music once in a while and go with the eclectic selections of Capcom's design team.    The announcer, however, is pretty crap. He says the same things over and over, and he often congratulates you even if you're in last place. He has a smooth yet barker style of speaking, which is great for a game like this, but he says a lot of things that are entirely disconnected -- a.k.a. late or wrong -- with what's actually going on the game. Another weird thing is that while in the cockpit mode (which is one of three camera viewpoints), the sound of the car is more like a jetliner than a four-wheeled automobile.It's become painfully clear that Auto Modellista is not for everyone. It's not a game you'll get into easily. It's an arcade racer that actually plays like a street-based rally racer, and not a very good one at that. I have scored this game this way because, despite the difficult and annoying controls that some people will never like, or perhaps even hate, the set of options, online play and sheer customization weighs in heavily in the overall final product. I personally spend more than 10 hours playing this game, beat it, and never really ever enjoyed the ~style~ of control. More specifically, I never enjoyed the control even when I began winning. The controls are without a doubt the game's biggest sticking point, and they'll probably push more gamers away than attract them. Then again, there is no doubt that the painfully-earned skill one earns by learning to play it, and once you do get good, you'll probably love Auto Modellista. My suggestion is this: If want to race online and you're a newbie, this assuredly isn't the game for you. If you desperately want an online, arcade-style racing game and you're willing to put in the time, then you may enjoy this tremendously. The level of outward and inner car customization is just awesome, and the whole showing off, comparing and contrasting aspect of Auto Modellista is an excellent idea that's perfectly implemented. Bottom line: Be wary of this one, you'll either love it or hate it.", "date": "Mar 28, 2003"}
