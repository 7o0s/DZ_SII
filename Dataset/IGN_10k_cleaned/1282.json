The only reasonable explanation is that throwing a car sideways on dirt is a heckuva lot of fun, even if you don't know anything about the real sport.  So, after getting our imports of Rally Championship and Colin McRae Rally, we now get the US version of the European Rally hit, Rally Masters.    When I first played the demo and read the feature list, I didn't believe there was any reality in the title.  The first thing was this idea of equal Rally cars running around a parallel closed circuit, each in its own lane in a continuous loop that forced each car to run both the inside and outside tracks.  First one to the finish line wins.  These are done in heats, where you have to win best two out of three.  This blended the head-to-head racing of 'normal' racing with the alone-on-the-track racing of Rally cars on diverse terrain.  I figured this was a great idea, but made up.  Oops, I was wrong, they actually do it!  There is a Rally Championship in the Canary Islands where Rallying's best drivers duke it out in equal cars instead of their own to see who gets bragging rights.  But of course you can't built a whole game around one circuit, so the developers decided to add several championship modes, bunches of open and closed tracks in varying countries and terrain, each with variants, mirror  modes, nighttime and weather modes, and of course networked multiplayer.  And then throw in a bunch of real drivers, three classes of Rally Cars including the top of the line FIA World Rally Championship cars.  That's the recipe behind Rally Masters.  The trick was pulling it off and still having a believable Rally game that pleased sim fans and casual fans alike.  My first impression was sheer pleasure at the graphics quality of the game.  Everything done here shows an attention to detail and polish, without sacrificing frame rate unless you get greedy and start pushing for levels your PC wouldn't dream of showing for most of your other games.  The tracks themselves don't have a great deal of variety within the length of the course, as compared the highly varied, detailed and long tracks of Rally Championship, but what is there is well laid out, challenging and pretty.  The colors of the game are all bright, crisp and vivid, almost to the point of being cartoonish.  There isn't any draw-in to speak of, and even the night views are a little less terrifying than they would be in real life in these cars.  I should note that not all locations have all the weather and time of day settings.  Some are either missing or possibly modes that you unlock later.  The cars themselves are reproduced very well, with moving suspension on each wheel, clouds of dust or mud or spray being thrown out behind cars, cracked windshields and crumple damage.  In muddy terrains, the cars get gradually mudsoaked, obscuring their sponsor names.  When you catch air the tires will hang lower from the suspension.  However, car damage isn't modeled as realistically as it could have been.  Smashing into things will dent the metal but not cause the kind of race ending damage you see in more simulation oriented titles.  The developers obviously want you to have a shot at finishing races.  Nonetheless, damage can put you out if you are too dense to take a hint from the first 10 collisions!  A constant bashing will slowly but surely turn your shiny new Rally Car into a rattletrap, knocking out the headlights, causing the transmission to go, which in turns causes your car to skip gears or hop maddeningly from gear to gear, or drop your speed down to a crawl.  An indicator in your view lets you know which parts of your car are healthy (green) to being on life support (red).  Oddly, sometimes bashing into something with one side causes the other side to get damaged.  Let's call this a bug.  There are several views you can drive from, including an in-car view with a nice thick steering wheel, though there are no hands turning it; it turns by itself!).  For multiple car races, you can turn an overhead mirror on and you will get get a detailed rear view in which you can clearly distinguish the positions of other cars.  One negative is that your view forward is never impaired by weather or by cracking up your front window in a crash.  It's a little weird to see a replay later showing your window was smashed up pretty good but while you were in the car everything continued as if nothing was wrong.  The actual handling of the car is closer to Colin McRae than it is to Rally Championship (okay, nothing drives like Rally Championship!).  That means that even with a front wheel drive car, you can easily turn the car and slide it sideways or spin it around.  You don't need to use the handbrake to lock the rear wheels and whip the car around, although you can do that if you want.  It's pretty neat that your handbrake will make a ratcheting sound similar to what you'd hear if you pulled up your own handbrake.  I found that the handbrake usage is a skill I have yet to master.  Every time I pulled it going into a hairpin I was either going too fast and slammed into a wall backwards into the far side of the hairpin, or the car whipped around farther than I'd planned, coming about to face back towards the way I had come.    In the version that we're getting here in the US, the braking is a little weird because the brakes are too strong at low RPM's.  That means it's all to easy to screech to a halt with the brakes, meaning you lose a great deal of time getting going again.  The alternative is to just lift the gas and slide sideways, but if you don't find a balance between braking and just lifting, you'll spend a lot of time either going too slow, hitting objects on the outside of the course, or both.  A patch for the UK version has been released which fixes this, among other problems, so I hope this means we can assume a US version of the patch will be out soon.  For the diehard sim fans the question will be how realistic the car physics are.  To be brutally honest, I can't be sure just how close they are, having never driven a Rally car.  However the car did everything I expected it to do from a weight transfer standpoint.  Probably the biggest arguments are about whether the effects are overdone or underdone.  If anything, they are overdone.   However, whether or not it is easy to slide these cars sideways (and recover them), we know that real Rally drivers do so regularly.  Therefore, when you can make the car drive that way in this game you just feel like you're in good company with the real drivers, which is a big part of what most Rally games are about.  I'll just say that if this isn't exactly what a real Rally car feels like, it sure does feel like what a Rally car ought to feel like!  The realism is sufficient to let you confidently use a wheel and pedals as your control system.  However, it's made to be joystick/gamepad friendly as well.  In fact, because of the ease with which you can get sideways and stay there, people with an analog gamepad may be the fastest at slamming into opposite lock and recovering.   With my Force RS wheel, I was kept quite busy in these cases.  The audio is very good in this game, and compliments the visuals nicely, including the backfiring that happens as gears are rapidly shifted.  A co-driver is present most of the time (not in the Rally Championship double loops), and uses the regular conventions of ~easy left~ through the numbers (~3 left~), and combinations (~5 left into 3 right over crest~).  To make life easier for those who can't keep up with the audio, a stack of cornering icons is constantly displayed, with each new icon pushing the old one out of the way, so that a combination will have a few icons popping through your view.   In my case, Rally Championship taught me how to use the audio effectively so I don't want any icons around.  But focus becomes key.  You can't just drive around the courses by what you see.  But all is not lost for those challenged by roadsides and audio: you can set an in-game option to show you a centered curving map line and arrow in the center of your HUD to help you out.  If you don't know what's coming, by the time you see it, it will often be too late.  In addition to these, you can hear the tire noises on most surfaces, as well as the sickening crunches of car impacts.   Fans around the track will applaud you as you go by them (you hear this more in replays than anything else), and you do hear the cars jockeying position around you when you are in head-to-head competition.  Replays happen after every race, even in multiplayer, and you have the option to save them for later viewing.  The camera views are stunning, and you can switch cameras, switch cars, and have full VCR-style control over the tape.  You can also change your replay view to include the same co-driver comments and icons as you got during the race, see your instrumentation, or just enjoy the race-style replay.  Either way, the graphics are quite enjoyable here.  The structure of the game is centered on multi-country, multi-race contests.  Each country contains a series of circuits.  One is, of course, the double loop Rally Championship course used for the side by side double loop contests.  There are also a couple of closed circuit larger courses and then several open stages that are similar in style to those in other Rally Games, where you simply go from point A to point B as fast as possible, using the instructions from your navigator to help you out.  The stages are not long, taking only a few minutes to complete, though they are a very busy few minutes!  Each of the courses in these countries will appear in mirrored mode, as well as at night and in rainy and snowy weather, depending upon the series you're entered in, and in multiplayer mode, almost all the cars and tracks are available, in single race or series mode.  What truly astounded me was how thoroughly I got my butt kicked by the people who race this game online.  They have truly memorized each course and perfected the fastest line through it, while people like me still rely on their copilot to remind them of what's coming up.  So if you're thinking of going online, I hope you have practiced up or don't mind getting soundly beaten by people who have!  Oh and by the way, they rarely brake (just a friendly hint!).  Depending upon the event and the rules, your ability to choose cars and customize them will change.  For the Rally Challenge double loop races, you get no choice over your car other than whether you want an auto or manual transmission.  For the more realistic Rally championships, you can choose your car once for the season, and can change your setup for the car, though the choices are limited to tire compound, suspension stiffness (front/rear) and gear ratio.  I wish I could say that I felt these were earth shattering decisions, but I still end up thinking that my driving more than anything else determines my success, so to people with garage-o-phobia, I'd say ~don't worry~, at least as long as you aren't getting your butt kicked online (where you will, with a straight face, try some of the most brain dead combinations of setup options with the illusion that the other guys are winning because they have found a 'secret' setup, not that I'VE done that  heh heh).  Because of all these play modes, ghost modes and time trial modes along with a huge set of variations upon tracks among countries and three different Formulas (two of which you must unlock), Rally Masters can keep even a casual racer busy for quite a long time.  What it lacks in realism it makes up with very good gameplay, and what it lacks in real licensed tracks, it makes up with a big diversity of tracks and cars.  -- Randy Magruder      Want to share your opinions with the world?
