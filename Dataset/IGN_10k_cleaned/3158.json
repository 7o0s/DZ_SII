That's the major problem with Tiny Toon Adventures: Wacky Stackers from Conspiracy: this game clones Puyo Pop, an excellent Tetris-esque puzzle game that was released several months before by THQ and Sega. Even though the developer added a few little, minor tweaks to the gameplay, the game's  just a Puyo Pop clone with Tiny Toons running across the screen; but working against it is the fact that the developers didn't include a bunch of features that are already available in Sega and THQ's product. Features Three modes of play Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  The concept of Wacky Stackers is certainly familiar: players work continuously falling pairs of colored eggs into a bin. By matching four or more of the same colored eggs, the shells crackle and disappear (in a very satisfying digitized sound effect, I have to say). Any eggs stacked on top will settle into the bin, creating a possible chain reaction if the player put any thought into his egg placement. So far, it's identical to the Puyo Pop design.  But there's admittedly a bit more to the game. By pairing up the same color in a two-by-two formation, those four eggs won't disappear. They'll form a huge egg that won't disappear until you match up another set of eggs right next to it, and it doesn't matter what color they are. The benefit here is, by breaking the egg, you'll earn a token that gets stacked along the side of your bin. The tokens are the second gameplay addition to this design; players can ~spend~ the tokens any time during the game, which will activate a special animation featuring a specific Tiny Toons character. Spending one token, for example, will send Dizzy Devil spinning on-screen as he munches away at a two-high stack of eggs to reduce the bin's stack. Two tokens will bring Plucky onto the scene as a fireman, hosing away half the stack. Some of these on-screen attacks are used against the opposing players: Spend six tokens, and you'll cause Montana Max to show up on the other person's screen, obscuring their view of their bin because he turns out the lights. Wacky Stackers is as basic as puzzle games come on the Game Boy Advance.  Players can choose to go through the game by themselves, against a computer AI opponent, or link up between systems...though the link up mode requires additional copies of the game for each system in the network chain (the THQ/Sega Puyo Pop featured single-cartridge multiplayer). But players can't choose who they're playing against in Vs. mode...the computer simply selects one character out of the Tiny Toons arsenal. And the only way you know who you're playing against is by the tiny text under the computer opponent's screen.  There's one additional mode, ~Puzzle,~ that challenges players to clear out the bin in a set number of moves. But since the game lacks any cartridge save, or even password save, this mode lacks any sort of progression that other puzzle games offer in a similar option. And because there's no cartridge save, top scores can't be recorded for all time. Wacky Stacker is, admittedly, a decent clone of Puyo Pop. But the developers focused more on the puzzle design than the actual level structure...the game feels very unfinished because of the lack of options beyond the initial menu. Unless you're seriously into Tiny Toons (which, as far as I can tell, has already run its course as a license), skip this one and get the real deal: Puyo Pop.", "date": "Nov 7, 2002"}
