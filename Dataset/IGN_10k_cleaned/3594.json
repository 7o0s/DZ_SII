Despite a few decent games, such as the aptly namedGodzilla for the NES, most games to bear the Godzilla name have been less than stellar, ranging from the mediocrity of the Game Boy color games to downright atrociousness of the Dreamcast's Godzilla Generations.      Nearly every time a new Godzilla game gets released legions of devout G-fans wet themselves with excitement at game store checkout stands, only to have their hopes of a playing a good Godzilla game crushed by a sub-par product.  There are very few exceptions to this rule.   Luckily, Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee is one of these exceptions.   A moderately updated port of the GameCube brawler of the same name, Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee is, without a doubt, the best Godzilla game to date and quite possibly the most four-player Xbox fun you'll find this side of Halo.   Gameplay  Something of a cross between WWE Raw and the original Rampage, DAMM manages to succeed where previous G-games failed; this one actually conveys the feeling of being in one of the classic Toho films, laying waste to a city full of innocent people as you kick the bejeesus out of a veritable who's who of Godzilla bad guys.   The basic premise of DAMM is about as straightforward as it gets:  You're a monster.  There are other monsters.  Beat them up.  Sure there's a story that involves Japanese-looking aliens in silly outfits, but it's only mentioned in the opening and ending movies of Adventure Mode.   Controlling your monster isn't particularly complicated, despite the fact that every single button on the controller is used.  You've got three attack buttons, as well as buttons to block, jump, run, pick stuff up and fire projectile attacks.  Even the right analog stick gets some use, allowing you to control the direction of your monster's head.  It may sound like a lot, but it's intuitive enough that even your most dim-witted friend will be putting up a decent fight within a matter of minutes.  While there are a number of complicated combos and strategies to be learned, a lucky button masher can still be a fearsome opponent.   It's this pick up and play aspect that makes DAMM such a great party game.  This is the sort of thing that your friends who don't really like video games will still be able to enjoy.  There's just something about picking up a ten story building and slamming it onto your friends head while he's lying on the ground that's hard to resist.      DAMM is a game that's built almost exclusively for multiplayer.  With the exceptions of adventure and survival, every single one of the games relatively small handful of modes is intended for two-to-four players.   Along with the traditional two-player versus mode, players looking for some hot four-way action can do battle with each other in Melee, Team Battle and Destruction modes.    In these modes, players cannot actually kill each other.  Instead, points are awarded each time you knock an opponent down.  The player with the most points at the end of the round wins.  Since nobody ever actually dies, there are never any of those dull, ~I got killed right off the bat and now I have to wait for everybody else to finish~ moments.  It works quite well.   Where Melee is essentially a free-for-all, Team Battle is, well, a team battle.  This mode is perfect for re-creating those cheesy tag-team battles from the Godzilla movies of the seventies.  Want to re-enact the Godzilla/Anguirus vs. Gigan/Ghidorah bout from Godzilla vs. Gigan?  Go for it.  Want to gang up on Ghidorah with Godzilla and Rodan, a la Ghidrah: The three-headed monster? Go right ahead.   Unlike the combat-only Melee and Team modes, Destruction mode allows players to take their aggressions out on the city surrounding them.  Instead of points being awarded based on damage done to other players, points are only given for destroying buildings.  Of course, you could always pick up your opponent and throw them into a building...    While the multiplayer modes are by and large great fun, there are a few minor issues that crop up.  For example, monsters perform different attacks depending on what direction you're pressing on the d-pad when you hit the attack button.  This works fine in two-player fights, because the camera generally stays in a slightly raised side view.  In four-player battles, however, the relatively stationary top-down view can make for some confusing moments as you try to figure out what ~up~ is when you're running toward the bottom of the screen.  It's not unmanageable, but it can be a little irritating.   Another problem is simply identifying your character.  When the camera is zoomed out as far as it goes, and everybody's clumped together, you can momentarily lose track of which guy is your own if you're not careful.  Compared to the alternatives of putting names over the monsters or using bright colors to identify them, though, an occasional moment of confusion isn't all that bad.    As far as single player offerings go, DAMM isn't quite as impressive.  You can play through any of the multiplayer modes against relatively intelligent bots, or you can try your hand in adventure or survival mode.  Survival mode is, well, survival mode.  You keep fighting guys until you run out of life and die.  Adventure is your typical arcade mode, in which you go from city to city, whupping opponents until you get to the boss, who in this case is Mechagodzilla.   Nothing special here.   Despite the fact that adventure isn't all that great, Infogrames still wants you to spend a lot of time with it.  By collecting randomly scattered Atari logos, you'll unlock various pieces of artwork from the Godzilla films as well as the game.  That's all well and good.  What's really disappointing is the fact that you only start the game with four monsters, and the only way new monsters can be unlocked is by beating adventure mode.  If you want to unlock everybody, you'll have to go through the game with every single character in the game.  Sigh.   For that matter, the character selection in DAMM is a bit wanting.  While pretty much all the most recognizable Godzilla monsters are here, eleven characters doesn't feel like a whole lot.  When you consider that multiple but very similar versions of Godzilla and Ghidorah are on that list, the number seems even smaller.   Luckily, we may see some more characters in this game soon enough.  While DAMM does have a ~download content~ option, we're unsure exactly what is planned, and when it will be made available.  Here's hoping Infogrames releases new monsters and cities, and does so in a timely manner.      Graphics  This is the best that Godzilla has ever looked. All of the character models in this game are simply spectacular.  These guys look more like giant monsters than the Japanese men in rubber suits ever did.  From the scales on Godzilla's back to the reflections in Mecha-King Ghidorah's armor, this iteration boats much more detail than the GameCube version.     Monsters move with a fluidity that, again, puts the films to shame.  Watching Godzilla's tail curl as he runs or Rodan's wings flap, it's tough not to be impressed.   As great as the character models are, the game's environments have a little trouble keeping up.  Individual buildings are nice and detailed, but taken as a whole most of the cities feel a tad cookie cutter, with groups of buildings divided into perfect square blocks.  This works fine on cities like Los Angeles, which is actually built that way, but the last time I looked out the window, San Francisco was a tangled mess of hills and streets, not a flat, neatly ordered grid with the pyramid shaped Transamerica building in the middle of it.    The amount of non-monster activity in the cities is fairly impressive, though.  Cars zip around the streets, just waiting to be crushed.  Helicopters circle, pelting you and your opponent with puny small arms fire.  Tanks even attack you with the oxygen beam from Godzilla vs. Destroyah.  This kind of attention to detail goes a long, long way towards creating the sensation that you're really wreaking havok on a terrified human populace.  Good stuff.    Sound  Raaaar!  Skreeeech!  Thud!  Get ready to hear a lot of this sort of thing in DAMM.  Some sort of imposing sound effect accompanies just about every action any monster takes.  Even the simple act of walking causes a deep thumping sound to emit from your speakers.  It might seem a little excessive, but overdone sound effects are a Godzilla staple.  It just wouldn't be the same without them.  Of course, this might not be the sort of thing you want to play while your parents are trying to sleep in the room above you.   The music of DAMM is pretty decent fare, vaguely menacing and reminiscent of old Godzilla tunes without, to the best of my knowledge, actually being those old songs.   Of course, you probably won't be listening to the game's music very much since Infogrames generously provided support for custom soundtracks.  Me, I've been battling alien beasts to the Sugarcubes.  Hey, it works surprisingly well.  While the single player mode leaves much to be desired, and the game does some from a few mildly irritating shortcomings, Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee is nevertheless a DAMM good game (Come on, you didn't think I'd go the entire review without using that pun, did you?)  Not only does it absolutely trounce any of the previous Godzilla games, it's also one of the best multiplayer party games available on the Xbox.  If you're the slightest bit interested in four-player gaming, go trade in your copies of Fuzion Frenzy, Kung-Fu Chaos and Shrek Super Party and pick this game up.", "date": "Apr 15, 2003"}
