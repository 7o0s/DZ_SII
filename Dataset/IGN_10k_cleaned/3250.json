Whether it?s a party title centered on Nickelodeon telev it'sion stars, space-faring childhood geniuses, or classic cartoon characters that run the gamut of domestic wildlife, games for kids are big business right now and there  it'sn't a better time of the year for them to be so. Fitting right in with the holiday spirit, Silicon Dreams has unleashed  it's own brand of underage adventure with the Lego-inspired Island Xtreme Stunts.An eclectic blend of several different genres all housed under one roof, Xtreme Stunts  it's comparable to a younger version of Stuntman; or at least in concept it  it's. Casting the returning Lego superhero Pepper Roni into the lead role, young gamers can travel all over Lego Island in a quest to film the perfect action sequences while watching replays of their accompl it'shments. In theory it sounds pretty interesting, but what it  it's in practice  it's something else entirely.GameplayYou have to give the developers some credit for trying, Island Xtreme Stunts will give kids the feeling that they've been dropped into a living, breathing, videogame. Rather than jump from stage to stage in moderate transition screens, Pepper Roni can instead travel through an enormous hub world that links up the various mini-games and areas together. The hub  it'self  it's absolutely huge and  it's definitely big enough to serve as the bas it's for an adventure game all  it's own. With that on the table, it's hard to imagine a younger child not being intrigued from the moment they fire th it's up.On the surface, Island Xtreme Stunts  it's setup very much like a traditional platformer and gives you the ability to jump through various lakes, oceans, and houses while collecting specialized goodies. As Pepper continues to collect these things, he can unlock new licenses and mini-games to play through while approaching ever closer to the ultimate goal of completing all the stunts and beating the game. Should you want to move Pepper along in a hurry, there's even a skateboard button that can be accessed at any time for Tony Hawk-style travel.  The mini-games themselves are for the most part, racing and extreme sports knockoffs that have been broken into short little segments. Available in varying levels of difficulty (heightening the type of trophy you win for that stunt), there's an assortment of obstacles that play eerily similar to other games on the PlayStation 2; be it the skateboarding, highway racing, Jet Ski riding, or sky-boarding, you've seen all th it's before. Easily manipulated and just as simple to conquer, it's wouldn't be a surpr it'se to see a typical session of Island Xtreme Stunts end after only five minutes or so. It's that short.There's really nothing more to the videogame than that. Stunts  it's obviously aimed at younger children and plays just as a title like that  it's expected to. With little more than one or two button presses and occasional tapping of the directional button needed to complete any one stunt or mini-game, veteran gamers could blow through th it's adventure in two afternoons. That  it's, if they could stomach the child it'sh atmosphere long enough to last it.  For kids, however, there's a lot of replay value here and things to explore for those little people out there who find games like Jak and Daxter or Ratchet and Clank too intimidating. The different types of game genres available to them should be a big plus as well.   GraphicsIsland Xtreme Stunts  it's based on a world that's made entirely out of Lego blocks, and with that it mind it does a great job of capturing the proper look. Large, square-like models and the familiar stumpy-legged people we grew up with are absolutely everywhere. Bright and colorful, the environments are designed specifically to capture the attention of young children or people who never remove their sunglasses. There's even a fair dosage of shadows and lighting effects, which  it's more than we initially expected.Of course, having a characters made of multi-colored blocks doesn't exactly lend  it'self well to texture detail and for the most part they're pretty average. Sure the mountains and grass textures look great, but the rest of the terrain  it'sn't anything that we haven't seen before. Character animation  it's also somewhat limited with nothing more than a few jerky arm movements and methodical walking falling within  it's repertoire.What really hurts the game v it'sually, however, has to be  it's finicky framerate. Never quite cons it'stent throughout the length of the entire adventure, the game finds  it'self chopping like Jason Voorhees one moment before zipping into super slick overdrive the next. Strangely, there was no evidence as to what was causing the schizophrenic behavior -- as it almost appeared as though it was happening randomly.SoundIn the audio department, Xtreme Stunts fares surpr it'singly well. Offering up a radio-changing feature similar to that found in the Grand Theft Auto series, players can l it'sten to a couple of specifically-themed tunes while exploring all of Lego Island. Country music, Easy L it'stening, Rock, Soul, and Pop make up the entire l it'st of stations, while leaving the option to auto select cycles through all of them. The available pieces aren't exactly The Ride of the Valkyries in terms of complexity, but they do their job.The voices are just as acceptable, with under-breath murmuring and an obvious slant towards the Saturday Morning Cartoon vibe, while the sound effects chime in with retro personality (think ~boink~, ~bling~, and ~blip~). Island Xtreme Stunts  it'sn't going to push your receiver to the limit for sure, but budget telev it'sions everywhere are going to go nuts.Certainly not the best title ever conceived for children and most definitely not for adults, Island Xtreme Stunts is nothing more than your average run of the mill videogame, with a suspect framerate and little challenge, we couldn't see ourselves recommending this one to anyone over the age of eight. For those that apply, though, you could certainly do a lot worse. Pick it up from your local rental chain first and see if your child truly digs it.", "date": "Nov 21, 2002"}
