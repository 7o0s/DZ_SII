Rocket scientists and brain surgeons get mad props for their superhuman mental prowess, but for every straight shooter, there's a Dr. Frankenstein waiting in the wings.  Anyone seen The Fly or Herbert West: Reanimator.. hmm, hmmmmm?  The defense rests its case.  And bearing in mind that B-grade horror film villains don't usually make quality computer game spokesmen, Cryo and Dreamcatcher deserve a little respect for delving into the depths of the past to pluck out a half-decent, eccentric genius to star in their latest sci-fi adventure.  H.G. Wells, or Wales as he's referred to, would of course be the nerd in question.  Though the majority of his peers' vices range from grave robbery to trafficking with otherworldly powers, Mr. Wales' Achilles heel is a fondness for the concept of time.  Predictably, this ambitious inhabitant of 19th century London's so obsessed with the ticking of the clock that he's gone off and built a vessel capable of propelling a man through the ages with the flick of a switch.  As if Murphy's Law weren't enough of a deterrent to this kind of counterproductive behavior, the poor schmuck's gone and upped the ante by setting the cruise control dial for 800,000 years in the future.  Yipes...even a half-wit could figure out what happens next.  Stuck in an anachronistic rut with a busted Chronohedron and no AAA membership, this particular Marty McFly isn't going anywhere, nor can he expect help from a crusty old coot named Doc.  Normally, this would be the point where I go off on a tangent about the whole hailstorm of crap titles the press and public's had to deal with ever since Myst reared its plastic surgery perfect little head.  Lo and behold, Cryo's saved everyone the trouble, because they've finally got with the program and published a 3D action/adventure hybrid that combines mindbenders with mindless violence.  Like a poor man's Resident Evil, the New Adventures of the Time Machine plays out from a variety of third person camera views, displaying 3D characters tromping through high resolution backgrounds of striking scope.  Actions occur in real-time, so combat, spellcasting, movement between scenes and acts of petty theft aren't drawn out affairs interspersed with cinematic transitions.  Huzzah!  Out of the point n' click dark ages and into the keyboard controlled light we come!  (Ed. note: Wheeeeeee.)  Pop quiz: You're stranded in a desert city that's half ancient Egypt, half Planet of the Apes.. what do you do?  Common sense would say reach for the spare cyanide pill, but in truth, the answer is that what you'll really do is manage to get devolved back into a kid before the first act has played out.  Assume the role of a tyke who's adult memory is still intact, you'll have to scour the four corners of the city for helpful hints, conveyed via a linear stream of dialogue by the various citizens going about their business on the dusty streets.  Prompted by a subtle nudge or two, intrepid adventurers can head off in search of useful items, firearms, answers to their lingering questions, and the occasional crystal through which magical powers of Chronomancy are awarded.  Challenge wise, the game's off kilter, as it targets multiple styles of play, not bothering to specialize in any one area.  Though many puzzles, such as the system of teleporters built into a hanging bridge, will likely get the best of you, a few prove challenging due to implementation, not intention.  Illustrating this point are movable objects and items, neither of which are highly discernable from the rest of the scenery. Fights come in many shades of difficulty as well, though the golden rule is strike hard and fast with ranged weapons, using magic for defensive purposes, a tactic made all the more sound by the fact that you've got a limited supply of Jad Garrul (mystical power) to contend with.  Although unprovoked melee encounters aren't a common worry, you should be saving frequently, because fatalities may occur due to hit point loss or environmental hazards.  Stomach the irregularities, though, and a jolly good romp can be had.  Imaginative landscapes and fanciful settings yield their secrets to the prying eye, as do the mobs of individuals that roam tomorrow's horizons, going about their personal errands.  Credible speech clips back up the script, which is a mish-mash of technology, religion, mysticism and science.  Cryo's cinematic standards remain high, meaning that you'll periodically be treated to a collection of brief, yet breathtaking, animated shorts whose sole purpose in life is to enhance the visual impact of the surroundings.  Even if you don't approve of the French on principle (and who does?), you've got to admire the gusto with which they approach their storytelling.  And zest's an admirable quality in a product, albeit one that plays second fiddle to gameplay as far as consumers give a rat's patootie.  While the New Adventures of the Time Machine sallies forth intent on delighting global audiences, it doesn't bother to break any new ground, or even cover the old ground exceptionally well to boot.  Be that as it may, the title's novel setting, thoughtful storyline, and awesome decor smooth out most of the warts. Sci-fi buffs can't go too far astray with this one, but PC owners who can't tell Captain Kirk from Yoda should stay light years away.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "Sep 13, 2000"}
