{"name": "Criticom", "name_review": "Criticom", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/21/criticom", "text": "3-D brawlers are now becoming the norm, having replaced their (primarily) 16-bit 2-D cousins. And for every great fighter that comes down the electronic pipeline like Tekken 2 or Tobal No 1, we get dogs like Criticom and Killing Zone. Marred by sloppy control, low frame rate, and dodgy graphics, these games give fighters a bad name.  Criticom almost works, too. That's the sad part. The graphics are decent, if anything, and the light sourcing is very nice. The backgrounds are also fairly decent - not on par with Tekken 2, but certainly better than the first. Unfortunately, the fighters themselves were animated by hand, that is, not motion captured, so they've got a jerky, unrealistic motion to them. And in a genre modeled off reality for the most part, that's a fatal mistake.  If this were the least of Criticom's problems, it would already be enough. But it's not. The frame rate is maddeningly slow, which everyone knows makes it really difficult to pull off any kind of move, special or not. Criticom is ultimately a disappointing game.", "date": "Nov 21, 1996"}
