{"name": "IndyCar Series", "name_review": "IndyCar Series", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/07/02/indycar-series", "text": "All things considered, it seems amazing that PC's and consoles have gone as long as they have without one single attempt to reproduce the Indy 500. The most recent efforts we can recall were both for the PC, and are at least five years old. Yet NASCAR has dominated the video game scene, particularly on consoles, and open-wheel racing has been only truly represented by Formula One games. Luckily Codemasters has crossed the Atlantic from the UK to yanks what we are apparently unwilling to produce ourselves: an IndyCar simulation.   This title is somewhat unique for Codemasters because of its previous efforts such as Colin McRae Rally and Pro Race Driver. After all, it's now entering a market full of Rally and GT racers. Because of this, it's hard to directly compare the game to that of any particular competitor, except the fact that IndyCar oval racing is rather similar to NASCAR -- albeit faster and without all the paint swapping and helmet-throwing.   Features  What you should immediately know is that this game is not particularly genre busting.  If you have no interest in oval based racing whatsoever, this game will probably not turn you into a fan. However, those who own NASCAR titles would do well to read on (and frustrated CART, IRL and open-wheel fans who want something more than the obligatory set of Formula One road courses each year as well).   As it's titled IndyCar series, the game includes all the tracks and most of the drivers you'd find in the Indy Racing League (IRL). You won't find any road courses or street courses here. It's all ovals, and they are a subset of the same set of ovals you'll find in NASCAR titles. Of course, you'll find the Indy 500, in all its glory, with a full 33-car field and even the four lap-qualifying format and Bump Day.    An excellent bonus is that everything you need for shifting, monitoring your fuel and number of laps of fuel remaining, drafting level, and weight jacker position are all conveniently shown on your HUD. All of this would be moot if Codemasters had made the mess of the rules of racing the way other titles have, all too often. However, we've found the behavior of the AI cars too be very, very, good overall. They hold their position when alongside. They pit without crashing into one another, they form up under caution and take evasive maneuvers, largely without incident. That's not to say we haven't witnessed the occasional AI boo-boo (such as a car merging out of the merge lane right into the middle of the track and getting obliterated by the faster traffic), but we're talking exceptions here, not rules.    The IndyCar series game also features some extras like the ole 'Madden Card' approach to unlockables. While all the tracks and most of the drivers are available, you unlock trading cards by accomplishing certain goals, like finishing a race, taking the pole, earning the pole for the Indy 500, breaking a lap record, etc. These cards are attached to either new liveries you can pick, or DVD documentary footage of various facets of IndyCar racing and specifically the 500. These mini-documentaries are impressively long and interesting to watch at least once if you have any interest in this history and greatest moments of the sport you're participating in.   Additionally, the game tries to teach you how to be a good Indycar driver by having IRL driver and former Indy 500 winner Eddie Cheever give you some video lessons, after which follow a Gran Turismo style test which can net you a gold, silver or bronze (and unlock an appropriate card). Unlike simple driving tests that are usually seen, some impressively sophisticated tests are provided, such as pitting and getting out and gaining positions in the process, or my favorite, taking a badly tuned car and using the garage and test laps to turn it into a serious speed demon (a 235 mph one-lap average at Indy is required for the gold. It was a delight to finally pull off a 235.4 lap for the goal after an embarrassing amount of time tweaking in the garage!).    Gearheads can rejoice at the fact that your setup options include the laundry list of front/rear wing angles, bump/rebound dampers, camber, toe-in, tire pressures, spring rates and ride height, all adjustable in fine increments for each independent part (4 tires, front/rear ride height, etc). These do affect your handling and lap times, as you quickly see when you try to go through Eddie Cheevers ~Masterclass~ mode. Each different item is thoughtfully explained on screen to help novices know how to tweak a car. Your auto save feature will automatically remember the qualifying and race setups you're using for your track. You can also copy setups between setup and qualifying.  It's quite nice to know that you do not have to start from scratch each time, and you also don't have to bother with remembering file names for saved setups. The hard work is done for you.     Gameplay  Codemasters has taken this license seriously, and it shows through with every detail included. For example, you can run both shortened and full-length races; you can tweak your weight jacker and fuel richness during the race to change your race strategy; cautions and restarts are fully implemented according to the IRL rules, and damage can either affect your car performance or put you out of a race.   As we spent hour after hour with IndyCar, it became fairly obvious that this was a true simulation and not an arcade game. That doesn't mean that its physics are necessarily on par with the best PC vehicle simulations, but it does mean that the things that are important in the real sport are reflected quite well in this title here. The cars are not excruciatingly difficult to drive, and we still have not found a way to make one of the cars go loose or oversteer. The limit here is not some arbitrary sliding/skidding tire model, but rather an unforgiving white wall and a bunch of other cars that really don't want you to get by. That makes this more of a racing sim than a driving sim, where smooth consistent fast laps are the challenge, not just keeping it on the road.   One way to differentiate arcade games from simulations is the AI. In almost every arcade title, it's a given that you can decimate the AI cars if two things don't happen: (a) you crash, and/or (b) they cheat. In IndyCar Series, you are presumed to have a reasonable attention span and ability to focus such that you don't mind reeling in an AI car by a few tenths of a second per lap, for many laps on end, slowly pulling them in until you are able to catch a bit of a draft and slingshot by them. You are presumed to be able to focus well enough to drive the racing line around an oval repeatedly for 50-200 laps while dodging through traffic without whacking them into a wall every time you try. It's also presumed that you can weave through heavy traffic without hitting anyone else. These presumptions take the game straight out of the arcade racing world and into the sim world, where people actually think it's more fun to drive the way the real guys do than the way you would in, say, Sega's Daytona USA or Burnout 2.    If what you want is a quick racing fix that looks like Indy, it's kind of hard to get long-term satisfaction from here. It simply tries too hard to be faithful to the real sport to be appealing to casual racers. It will try and teach you if you really honestly want to learn though, so if you haven't been scared off at this point, there's hope yet.   One problem with oval racers historically has been that it's quite hard to tell one car from another, because about the only difference you can see from the rear is the bit of rear wing that is visible (as compared to the various paintjobs on the back of a stock car). You'll likewise have to be paying attention to the scoreboard and your crew chief to really know who is who around you. However, by the time it matters and you are close enough to deal with them, the cars resolve into nicely detailed models that you interact with on the speedway. Your closure rates on the cars ahead are also realistic, so you don't scream by them like they are standing still; you have time to identify them and form a strategy for dealing with them. The draft sucks you in and might cause you to hit someone if you refuse to let out of the throttle or pull out of the draft in time, but it's not exaggerated to where it feels unrealistic. It feels just right. You've got to be within a few tenths of the car ahead of you to pick it up.    Another problem that developers have to deal with is the sheer amount of possible confusion during a race with a large field, cars pitting, caution periods, lapped traffic, etc. Some of the nicest looking NASCAR games can fall flat when trying to give the information to the player so they know what is going on and can form strategy. IndyCar Series does a great job here. The race engineer is always telling you the intervals to the cars ahead of you, to the race leader, to the car behind you, whether the car ahead of you is racing you for position, your car status, etc. In addition, certain graphics touches exist to help your situational awareness. For example, during a caution, some games let you scream right past the car you were supposed to stay behind, and then either penalize you, or start saying 'stay behind the XX car'.   This isn't particularly helpful if you don't know where the XX car is! The car you need to stay behind here is indicated by inverted green triangles that float above it. Until you see it, drive on! When you see it, slow down and follow it. Simple solution, nicely done. Not once did we feel confused about our position, what the rules were, what we should do, etc.  The game just puts you in the game in a state where you can actually figure out what the best race strategy is, not just drive and pray.   The actual racing on the tracks is largely a joy. The steering is responsive without being twitchy. You generally will go to full stick deflection in the middle of a corner, but you can make fine adjustments down the straight without nosing your car into a wall or onto grass.    And lest you have a hard time finding a level of difficulty that's ~right~ for your abilities, an advanced option lets you enable a flexible AI that adapts to your speeds. At the end of the race, you'll find out which direction the AI leaned towards. Do really well, and you might see an AI figure of 100% on the bottom of the final scoreboard. That means the AI was in full realism mode to fight with you. If you see 95%, it means the AI was pulling its punches because you clearly haven't got ~the skillz~ yet.    Damage is represented in various levels from the obligatory ~I am God, Fear Me~ invincible mode where you just go through the opposing AI like a bowling ball through pins, to the adrenalin inducing full realism mode where you drive like your car is made of your mother's finest china. While the 'full damage' mode isn't fully real, it does discourage paint swapping and will make you feel that bit of adrenalin when you're within a hair's breadth of the wall. It's more forgiving than real life, though; in one incident, our front wheel became a bit wobbly after scraping it along a wall, and the crew chief reported our electronics out. A few minutes later when trying to slingshot an AI car, our engine cut out for about a second. It then proceeded to do this once every lap or so, and usually at an inconvenient time.   One annoyance with games that offer long races is the fact that you are forced to do it all in one sitting. Not here. When you're running the Indy 500, for example, you can opt to save the game while you're rumbling down pit lane. The game auto-saves, and you can continue the race from there at any point. Personally, I used it to try to figure out if I could win the race if I adopted one fuel strategy over another. If I failed, I could always quit and reload the race at the save spot and try a different approach. But mainly, it's great to be able to race a long race in manageable chunks if you don't have three hours of uninterrupted game time, or you have ADHD and can't stare at the business end of a never ending oval for more than 10 minutes at a time!    Even your tire temperatures for the inner/middle/outside edge of each tire are reported to you via live color coding on your HUD, so you can know just which tires are being abused, and how to fix the problem.This is the stuff that makes sim fans very, very happy, and makes arcade racers very, very disgusted.   Graphics  Visually no awards will be won here. There are jaggies aplenty, and no one will say that either the cars or scenery is particularly memorable. It seems that with the requirement of being able to run 33-car fields, the developers understood they weren't going to be able to have gorgeous graphics and frame rate, too. What they are though, is realistic, and they are smooth with a consistently high frame rates that never seem to perceptibly drop.   Everything from the cockpit view to the track models seem dead-on based upon on observations of real circuits and cars. The cockpit view seems to be a bit too narrow, and the wheels look a little large, but we can't necessarily tell you that it's wrong. The polygonal model looks absolutely correct, and if a camera placed at cockpit height in that model looks that way, who are we to argue? What I do have a gripe with is the narrowness of the field of view. When cars are ahead of you and to your right and left, there is a sizable blind spot where the only way you can know for sure they are there is to look at your position in the field to see whether you were passed.   Unfortunately, there aren't any mirrors to use. First it happened in Pro Race Driver, then in the otherwise brilliant Grand Prix Challenge from Atari, and now this -- disturbing trend! It's really outrageous that there isn't even a rudimentary mirror showing even a blip where a car would be positioned along with its size. Bizarrely Codemasters put in colored arrows along the bottom of the screen in Pro Race Driver to represent trailing car locations, but developer Brain in a Jar decided not to do that. That means your spotter and engine sounds are all-important.    Replays are available at any time of the last few laps that have been run, from any car's viewpoint, including a TV-camera angles.  I'm less than impressed with the external angles, mainly because they seem obsessed with just showing ~speed~ instead of showing me just what-the-hell is going on. Often times you'll slow down the replay to see a replay of an incident going down a straight, but the static cam that is tracking it just shows a bunch of small black blobs and smoke off in the distance because the camera was geared to showing you just how fast the cars whiz by a stationary object. You often have to switch to a conventional behind-the-car cam or an in-car cam to figure out just who zigged when they should have zagged, and witness the vehicle carnage thereafter (which we all secretly enjoy, right?)   Sound  Given the lack of mirrors, the sound in IndyCar warrants a serious bullet point. In fact, it's crucial to the game. If you have a receiver capable of handling DTS soundtracks, you're in for a real treat, as the game supports 5.1 surround.     You are given two sources of information in the race:  the engine noises and your spotter.  Your spotter will do NASCAR style callouts (~Car inside. Still there. Still there. Clear inside~).  The engines will also get louder and move from one rear speaker to the next. You can 'sense' what's going on around you even if you can't see it, and when it becomes an overlap situation, the engine sounds and the spotter make it glaringly obvious what's going on. The cars also draft you and pass back after you pass them. Do not think that just because you've gone by someone the contest is over. You will hear their engine get louder and pull alongside, and quickly bear witness as they slip right past you. You can block, you can boost your fuel mixture, or you can just play leapfrog with them around the circuit, just like the real sport.Finally, as is always the case, there are gripes and nitpicks and glitches I could talk about. The lack of mirrors is one. The field of view from in-car is rather narrow, and I've observed some bizarre pitting strategy by the AI (such as not pitting until two laps after the pits are open during caution - if you're going to pit, you pit at the first available opportunity under caution). The fact that your crew chief doesn't ever seem to change his suggested pit strategy based upon your actual stops is another nuisance, but one you can safely ignore. Although the game itself doesn't break much new ground as a racing title, the fact is that what it DOES do, it does very well.  Indy Racing is VERY well represented in this title. The strategies, tactics, and on-track behavior of the cars is eerily like the '500 I just got done watching yesterday (note to Codemasters:  Kudos on the timing of the release, guys!). Without hesitation, I recommend to anyone who owns any console NASCAR title or wants to get a little bit more than the endless parade of GT-style sprint race clones that seem to come out every few months, especially if you want to see oval racing done RIGHT.  The gameplay is very believable with almost every real-life aspect of the sport reproduced for your pleasure.  The challenge level is great, the dicing through traffic is adrenalin inducing (I had to force myself to release my death grip on the controller a few times), and the focus required to play is high.  It just feels real, and what more can you truly ask of a game like this?", "date": "Jul 2, 2003"}
