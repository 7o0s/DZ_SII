Whether you played the original, plastic peg edition of the game or had a friend with the superduper electronic edition, Battleship was a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. The board game remains a brisk seller, but if you lack another player to sit down and trade torpedoes with, Vivendi's new mobile division has a very playable alternative for you: Navy Battle.   Set in World War II, players can engage is a very basic story mode by pressing through American, British, Chinese, and Japanese campaigns. No matter which side you pick, the basic tenets remain the same. You set up your array of warships while your AI-controlled opponent does the same. And once you've swiveled and spun your five different-sized ships into a suitably random-looking pattern, it's time to fire torpedoes across the digital seas. One square at a time, you drop fire shots across the theatre of war, hoping to score a hit so you can prolong your turn. Every miss offers your opponent a chance to return fire.   Navy Battle offers an updated mode with new weapons, like missiles, that attack multiple squares in enemy waters. Entire rows and columns are eliminated, but you only get a few chances to use these super weapons. And some weapons are only available as long as their associated ship is still intact. For example, the sonar which reveals ship positions, only works as long as your submarine is in good shape. Even with only a few shots, these advanced weapons can really make the game easier. However, it also speeds up a game session, which isn't such a bad thing for mobile.   Solo play is fine enough, but enemy AI is a bit uneven. I lost very few rounds, thanks to enemy commanders foolishly grouping their ships together and the ease of using the new weapons. Head-to-head mutliplayer via pass-the-phone offers a much more formidable challenge, but it also requires you to have another player nearby. In a future edition, I'd love to see online multiplayer where you used SMS alerts for trading blows.   Navy Battle uses a nice, clean interface. The screen is dominated by blue, but the thermal green wrapper is a nice touch. Little icons help you keep track of which ships are in play. Air strikes and basic attacks have little animation, but a Battleship clone doesn't necessarily need to be dressed up to be any more playable than it already is.  Navy Battle offers good Battleship-style play with some extra goodies (story mode, super weapons) to keep things interesting. Not every game has to advance the ball to be fun, especially when you're working within such established boundaries as Battleship. It's hard to really sell Navy Battle, because you either like Battleship or you don't. If you come down in the first camp, and have been itching to be a mobile admiral, Navy Battle is the download for you.", "date": "Sep 2, 2006"}
