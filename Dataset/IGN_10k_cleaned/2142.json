{"name": "Guilty Gear X", "name_review": "Guilty Gear X", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/02/guilty-gear-x", "text": "As several of my very dear friends would put it, ~pretty...~  This is the primary draw of Guilty Gear X.  It is an extremely pretty game.  Depending on how you slice it, it is arguably the prettiest game ever made, considering that 3D graphics have never yet achieved the precision of detail that you can do with well-drawn sprites these days.  Capcom, the other major purveyor of two-dimensional action left on the market, still insists on producing progressively nastier low-res characters amid its paradoxically gorgeous Naomi-driven backgrounds, and so Arc System Works gets to stand alone, with the only completely high-res 2D fighter on the market.  Watching Guilty Gear X in motion is enough to induce serious heartache in the sprite supporter -- ~why,~ cries the player of Mega Mans and Castlevanias past, ~do these evil bastards not make more games that look this good?~  Heavy sigh.  But Guilty Gear, despite some largish holes in its gameplay, is a good enough fighter to keep your mind on the task at hand.  Gameplay  As mentioned in earlier odds and sods of coverage, Guilty Gear  lead planner Daisuke Ishiwatari also happens to be the character designer and the voice of cover boy Ky-Kiske.  A bit of a vanity project, this is.  It's hard to argue that GGX is not a graphical showcase first and foremost -- something like Street Fighter III or Mark of the Wolves is well ahead in terms of depth and balance.  This is not to say a healthy helping of cheese can't entertain, however.  Guilty Gear is aggressively combo-happy, juggle-intensive, and friendly to the hammerer of buttons.  On the Cheap-O-Meter, it sits somewhere to the left of Samurai Spirits 2, and just a dash to the right of Asuka 120% Burning Fest Limited -- it's easier to set up juggle combos than in the Samurai games, albeit not quite so appalling as Asuka's shooter-fan design.  Beginners can hop right in and gleefully slash away, but at the same time there's plenty of room for the advanced player to flex their muscles, especially when you start min-maxing the different characters' defensive qualities.  There are variables for damage resistance, juggle resistance (some characters fall faster), jumping ability, and much more, which all factor in the development of big (5-6+ hit) combinations.  Most of the cheapest features in Guilty Gear are easily avoided, meanwhile.  The canned air combo launchers have such a hideous delay that the advanced player will probably dispense with them entirely, and it's easy to form a gentleman's agreement banning the insta-kill ~DESTROY~ attacks during multiplayer games (in the single-player game, why feel any shame in using them?  Damn near the only way you can kill Dizzy...).  Though serious purists may reject GGX out of hand, it's a great alterative for those (like me) who just can't quite get a handle on more complex, precision-intensive games.  Graphics  So far as we can tell, Guilty Gear X looks as good on the PlayStation 2 as it ever did on the Dreamcast or Naomi arcade hardware (making the usual allowances for a TV display versus the pristine clarity of an RGB monitor).  And that's very, very good.  Sprites and backgrounds alike are drawn in high resolution, with none of the jagged edges still present in Capcom's games.  A ridiculous frame count means extremely smooth animation, definitely in the SFIII/Garou class.  The character designs are a broadly mixed bag, but most players will be able to pull out one they're fond of.  Types range from Potemkin's overbearing bulk to Millia's Matsumotoid slenderness, with various bishonen swordsandrogynes and an anchor-wielding munchkin stuck in between.  Honestly, there's no global adjective to describe Guilty Gear's design sense, aside from something uselessly vague like ~weird.~  Ishiwatari just has a very, very active imagination, and we get to reap the benefits.  ~We~ I suppose is not universally descriptive, but I'd wonder whether anyone who doesn't like the look of this game isn't badly in need of some sort of sense-of-humor transplant.  Like everything else about the game, Guilty Gear's looks are meant to be enjoyed, not taken seriously.  Sound  Say it with me, Anthony...BUTT ROCK~!  Guilty Gear X is tracked with wall-to-wall cheez rawk from round 1 to the closing credits.  Said credits offer attribution for guitars, bass, and synthesizers -- the instrument repertoire has been stripped to the bone to offer you the maximum hair-metal possible for your money.  This presents a fairly black-and-white decision to the player.  Either you will run to the toilet, vomit horribly, and then kill the music volume forevermore, or you will do as I did: play one-handed with the other arm held up in a permanent slayer, bang your head repeatedly between rounds, and shell out thirty bucks for the imported ~Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks~ album.  If things get really horrible, you may even start buying the import vocal EPs, although your humble narrator has managed to forebear (they still haven't released one with Millia-Rage's music on it).  There are slow atonal pieces (Potemkin's ~Burly Heart~), more conventional Power Ballads (the closing ~Calm Passion~), MERC Standard Issue RAWK (Sol's ~Keep Yourself Alive~), and of course, plenty of gloriously overdone X-style speed metal (the harpsichord-accompanied ~Writhe In Pain~ and Dizzy's gloriously goofy chorus-preluded ~Awe Of She~).  In every case, you will like it, or you will loathe it.  Me, I like it a lot.  You, you can check some of the MP3 downloads below to make your decision.  Before the music everything else rather pales, but GGX does feature a competent array of voice clips and suitable impact in the effects suite.  Slashes slash, punches crunch, Faust's constant giggling is always a kick, and Ky's poofy Holy Knight falsetto contrasts nicely with Sol's low, thuggish guttural.  This is a game that's as much fun to listen to as look at -- providing, as in both cases, that your taste is kinked properly.  A Note on the American Release  After all this fulminating praise, I would like to conclude with a few words for Sammy USA regarding the raw deal they are presently laying on American gamers.  As you may or may not know, the American version of Guilty Gear X for PlayStation 2 is arriving about a month before the game hits the PS2 in Japan.  This is because the Japanese PS2 game, entitled Guilty Gear X Plus, is coming with a handful of extra features, including an art gallery mode and two extra characters (Justice and Kliff Underson, both refugees from the original Guilty Gear who didn't make it into the original version of X).  The American version doesn't include any of this good stuff -- it's identical to the Dreamcast version.  This is nonsense, and it makes me angry.  There's no reasonable reason why the US version shouldn't come with those extra features -- holding the game back a month or so isn't going to hurt the sales of a niche product like this one bit.  If Sammy or Majesco is worried about the importance of beating this or that game to market (Capcom Vs. SNK 2, say), they need to size up the appeal of this game from a more objective standpoint.  It will be bought by its fans, the enthusiast gamers who still follow 2D fighters, and by the people those fans can reach by word of mouth.  The time it hits market is a secondary factor -- meanwhile, that primary factor, word of mouth, will be hurt by the fact that gamers in the know are aware of the existence of a superior import release.  Perhaps there are other factors of which I'm not aware, but I can't think of any off the top of my head.  Well, there's one that's bouncing around in my mind, but I don't like it one bit -- but if I see something like ~Guilty Gear X: Director's Cut~ announced in the next few months...Hm.  This is a bit of a down note to end on, yes?I complain because I care, though.  The prospect of getting less Guilty Gear than I ought bothers me because I want as much Guilty Gear as I can get.  This is a great choice for the PS2's first 2D fighter, despite the unusual quarter it comes from -- it's especially rewarding as a multiplayer game, providing you and your fellow players don't mind a little cheese between friends.  Just outlaw those death attacks right off.  No point in inspiring more bad feeling than absolutely necessary.", "date": "Oct 2, 2001"}
