Both games demonstrated incredibly accurate dirt-road racing physics with an arcade touch for added flair to ensure that the games were fun and that they were.   With Rainbow latest release, Splashdown, the company's goal seems to be to do the same with water that they have done so well with dirt -- create a perfectly controlling racing game that lets the player know how it feels to be on the watercraft that's being used in the game.   Gameplay As far as control is concerned, Rainbow has yet once again come through with flying colors. The control is about as perfect as it can get and after playing the game you'll have a good idea about how it would feel to ride a real-life Sea-Doo.   The left analog stick is obviously used to steer the craft and control the body lean of the rider, which plays a very important roll in the game. By pressing forward, you make the rider lean forward, which in turn slows down the craft and allows you to make quicker and sharper turns since it's pushing the front of the craft underwater. Likewise, when you pull down on the analog stick, it makes the rider pull back, which causes the Sea-Doo to hydroplane, which in turn allows you to get a little more speed.   And it's up to the player to use a combination of both of these techniques to have a chance at winning any of these races on any level above easy, as if you simply just hold on the gas and steer around the buoys, you won't win any races. In order to get the most out of your Sea-Doo, you're going to need to use both techniques to help you speed up as much as possible when you need to and slow down for turns when needed.  What's more, the game makes use of a fairly cool trick system that rewards you for doing tricks by upping the power meter of your watercraft. By doing tricks you fill up your power meter, which makes you able to travel even faster, and by doing more complex tricks you'll fill up your power meter even faster. And the best part is that the need to do tricks, the advanced control techniques for speeding up and doing sharp turns, and the course designs are all melded together in such a way that it's important to be a master of all facets of the game.   You can't just rely solely on doing big tricks or by learning to effectively maneuver your Sea-Doo. If you just make use of one of these facets of the game, you won't be able to beat the game on the harder difficulty settings. This combined with some really awesome courses, of which there are about 18 in total based on different locations from around the world, make for a highly enjoyable and extremely addictive racing gameplay.   The only real problem with it all is that while there are 18 different courses, each filled with lots of shortcuts and hidden goodies to find, a lot of them end up feeling the same and the racing mechanics that you use when playing through them will often seem a bit on the repetitive side of things. It's only really a small problem, though, and doesn't keep this from being a must-have title for those of you looking for a water-based racing game.  Graphics The year 2001 will likely go down in the annals of videogame history as the year of great looking water. The most often heard question at this past May's Electronic Entertainment Expo was probably, ~can you please get out of my way?~ but the second was likely, ~did you see the water in that game?~ So many games that were shown at the show or have been or will be released this year have beautiful water.   And it's not just the water-based games, either, as action and adventure games like Ico, Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance and countless other next-generation titles have had great looking water. What's my point? In a year where water has become the focus of the attention of many gamers and journalists, Splashdown reigns supreme. It might not have the big waves, but as far as the way the water looks, this is about as good as it gets.  The lighting on the water, the way it moves, the wakes that your Sea-Doo make and how they react with walls and other crafts, and the transparency is all near perfect and ultra realistic. And beyond the water, the game sports some really nice rider animation, as the guys and gals on the Sea-Doos move perfectly in-line with how a real person would if they were trying to do the same things on one of these watercrafts in the real world.  If you were to get ultra-picky, one could complain that the game only runs at 30 frames per second instead of 60 fps. But, this is a really small one and it's likely that the majority of the people that play it won't know the difference anyway. Nevertheless, it's a truthful critique and one that a few people might see as an issue.  Sound As seems to be the case with any game with licensed songs, you'll either going to love or hate the soundtrack based on your musical tastes. Because of this, I figured the best way to evaluate the music would be to pass along the musical tracks that are included in the game. Here's what you get to listen to:   Sum 41 ~All She's Got~  Sum 41 ~Rhythms~  Smash Mouth ~All Star~  Groovie Ghoulies ~Chupa Cabra~  Groovie Ghoulies ~Graceland~  The Donnas ~You've Got A Crush On Me~  Man or Astro-man? ~A Mouthful of Exhaust~  SR-71 ~Right Now~  KMFDM ~son of a Gun~  Blink 182 ~The Rock Show~  Otis ~Hold Your Breath~  The Dude ~Rock Da Juice~   I personally like about half of these tracks and think that they as a group do fit the feel of the game for the most part. The only real complaint that I have with regard to this is that all of the music sounds a little too similar and could've used a larger quantity of songs, as well as a nicer mix of different sounding tunes.   The sound effects are pretty decent and the sounds of the Sea-Doo engines do seem to reflect how they sound in our world. The game also has character voices, but they don't really play that large of a role in the game. Most are just stereotypical bits that seem to be thrown in for comedic purposes and it all works in the regard.The big question that's on everyone's minds seems to be -- ~how does Splashdown stack up against Nintendo's Wave Race: Blue Storm on the GameCube or Eidos Interactive's Wave Rally for PlayStation 2?~  The answer? Well, there's not really a simple answer, especially when it comes to comparing Splashdown to either Wave Race or Wave Rally. Both of those games are Jet Ski games while Splashdown is a Sea-Doo-based racing game and with this simple little dissimilarity comes different racing mechanics as you must lean forward for more speed with Jet Skis and must pull back to hydroplane with Sea-Doos to get more speed. Wave Race and Wave Rally also require you to master the waves in order to win, while Splashdown is less about the waves and more about doing tricks to gain speed and learning to best maneuver your craft in the water. Subsequently, while they are all on water, Splashdown is really an entirely different racing experience than the other two titles (those can be compared directly, though...). It actually probably compares more directly to Rainbow Studios first PlayStation 2 title, ATV Offroad Fury, as it has the same basic feel of that game even though you're on completely different surfaces. If you must have some sort of comparison between the three games to make you happy, then I'll give you this -- Splashdown has hands-down the best looking water of the three. The waves are bigger in the other two, but no water in a videogame has looked this amazing.All of the comparisons aside, what really matters is that Splashdown is a highly enjoyable racing game and one that's definitely worth experiencing. The gameplay is highly addictive, it has a high-level of challenge and the water never fails to impress. Even after having played in the area of 20 hours of this game, I still find myself distracted by just how good it looks.", "date": "Nov 7, 2001"}
