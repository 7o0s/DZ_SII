Whether it's an updated version of a classic like Frogger, or collections of games reproduced in all their simple glory, these gaming reduxes are selling quite well while at the same time appeasing fans of a simpler time.  With that in mind, Midway brings the Dreamcast its first, but definitely not its last, collection of vintage games.  Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Volume 1 gathers up six of early gaming's greatest moments and puts them together, fully replicated just the way you remember them.   A compilation is only as good as the games it contains.  This one has Joust, Defender, Defender 2, Robotron 2084, Sinistar, and Bubbles.  Doing a quick count, that's four high-profile classics, one slightly lesser known but not totally unheard of title, and one totally obscure game, the variety that only seems to ever be heard of on these collections.  I'll touch on each game in it's own paragraph, but suffice it to say, these games are graphically and aurally exactly the way they were back in 1982.  They aren't graphically enhanced, there are no added gameplay ~features~, nada.      We'll start off the festivities with Joust.  This game hit the arcades in 1982 and filtered to many home consoles not too long after.  You play a knight on a flying ostrich type creature, trying to defeat other similarly mounted knights by bumping into them from above.  Clear the screen of your enemies, and you move onto the next stage, packed with faster and harder enemies.  It's a very simple concept, but what makes it challenging is the unique control.  Momentum comes into play strongly here, but those who become one with the ostrich will persevere.  Joust's control setup translates well to the Dreamcast controller, so it's safe to call this a perfect port.  Overall, a fun game and a worthy addition.    Next up is the incredibly addictive Robotron.  Of all the games on this collection, this one perhaps holds up the best against the test of time.  You play a nameless fellow who is the last hope for the human race.  The gameplay consists of running around on a one screen playing field, attempting to clear the screen of evil enemy Robotrons, all the while trying to save the last human family, who are intelligently wandering around in the middle of the warzone.  Some of these Robotrons cannot be killed, but if you eliminate all of the enemies that can actually be destroyed, you will move on to the next, more crowded stage, usually loaded with new and harder baddies.  In the arcade, this game used a unique setup of two sticks, one for movement, the other for firing.  Although this is not identically replicated with the Dreamcast's layout, the setup performs adequately.  Robotron is definitely the all-star of this collection.    Since Defender and Defender 2 are so similar, I will cover them both in one paragraph.  These games are side-scrolling shooters that were so far ahead of their time, it was just ridiculous.  Essentially you must eliminate all of the alien forces in the stage while making sure the humans scattered across the surface stay alive.  This is another game where your momentum comes into play, because you can travel in both directions at various speeds, and you will need to master that aspect of the gameplay if you want to get full enjoyment of these games.  The control of both games has translated well to the Dreamcast controller.  Defender 2's inclusion basically overshadows the originalDefender, but it's nice to have both for the sake of completion.  Defender 2 is a genuine classic, and still holds up fairly well.    Then we have Sinistar.  I'm not going to dispute the fact that this game did a lot of things that were quite advanced at the time, and the fact is that this is a fondly remembered title in a lot of people's minds, but the game was and is far too difficult to be properly enjoyed.  The game plays a lot like Asteroids, or for you youngins out there that need a more modern point of reference, Armada.  Basically the second you start playing, unseen enemy drones will start working on building the ultimate evil, the Sinistar.  This guy will eat your ship in one bite and cannot be harmed by your basic weapon, so you must comb the edges of space debris for crystals to make bombs out of, all the while evading fire from enemy ships.  At a certain point, the Sinistar will be formed, bellow out his trademark digitized speech, and come after you, very quickly.  At this stage, you'd better hope you have enough bombs to take him out, because that is the only thing that will stop him.  Once he's destroyed, it's on to the next level, where Sinistar will be built faster and the enemies are smarter.  To be honest, this game really isn't much fun anymore, but diehard fans will still get a kick out of hearing the nasty old Sinistar shout out his various threats.    The last game on the disc is Bubbles.  To be honest, I never played this game before now, so it doesn't have nostalgia in its favor the way the other games do.  I don't suspect many people would remember this one at all, but feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.  You play as a soap bubble in a sink.  You have to guide the bubble around, scooping up crud and little bugs to make yourself bigger.  Keep an eye out for roaches, scouring brushes, and razors though, because they will pop you in the blink of an eye.  Your goal is to clean all the crud out of the sink, at which point you will move onto the next level.  This game is representative of the surreal and unusual game concepts that were common in video gaming's early years.  As you gather up crud and get larger, a big freaky smiley face appears on your bubble.  Weird stuff.  This game was a bit boring to me, but I guess as filler goes, it's not that bad.    The quality of the games is pretty good, I have to admit.  However, the games are all you get.  Other than being able to play around with the dip switch settings of the original games, there isn't much in the way of options.  There are no interviews with the producers, no special artwork, no history of the games.  In other words, these six games that take up less than a meg total are all that are on this GB disc.  While the game is budget priced, it still would have been nice if they had gussied it up a bit similar to what Namco does with their Museum collections.  Perhaps putting more than six games on the disc would have been nice too.  Nevertheless, as collection discs go, this one has a pretty good ratio of classics to filler, and is probably one of the better collections of retro games I've seen.  Definitely recommended to all nostalgic gamers suffering from polygon burnout.  -- Shaun Musgrave, IGNDCThis collection is tremendous fun even for people who've never played the games.  However, I wish Midway had added more than just these six games.  Think of how cool it would be to have a whole catalogue on one GD-ROM!", "date": "Jul 12, 2000"}
