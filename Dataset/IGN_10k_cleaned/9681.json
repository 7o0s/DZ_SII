That's exactly what Master of Illusion is: this generation's magic kit. But instead of the trick hankies, cup and balls, and collapsible wands, you use the Nintendo DS as the tricks' ~prop.~ Master of Illusion is easily one of the most unexpected products on the Nintendo DS. Use your Nintendo DS to perform magic tricks? All right! It's certainly unique, and there's entertainment value in Master of Illusion, but keep in mind it's not a game; most of what you get out of this product is what you put into it. If you're not willing to show off your skills to wow an unsuspecting audience, the whole idea will be pretty much lost.    Master of Illusion is also a tough product to review. It's less of a game in the traditional sense than most of Nintendo's other Touch Generation products. This is a tutorial on how to perform magic tricks, and to review the game means to talk about the tricks, ruining the enjoyment and idea of the product. There's a general ~magician's code~ and the problem of revealing what the tricks are and how they're done. So to honor the code (and to not spoil the enjoyment for others) you won't find any secrets revealed nor will you find any allusions to how the illusions are performed.   The package is divided into three sections: Solo Magic, Performance, and Practice. Solo magic is tricks that the system performs on anyone that picks up the system; the Nintendo DS becomes the master illusionist. These are tricks in the ~mathematical~ design or in visual illusions that might take one or two attempts to see the ~trick~ behind the trick. These are meant for the critical mass  once you've performed the Solo Magic on yourself or someone else, you need to move onto the next rube or it's a wasted effort.   In the performance section, these are tricks that you perform on other people using the Nintendo DS. Some require touch screen interactivity by the person you're performing to, but mostly you have to remain in control or the tricks will never work. In the Master of Illusion pack you get a set of playing cards that are used in many of the performance tricks. Clearly there's a reason why the game gives away a deck of cardsand it's a damn fine deck of cards to use, and works well with the Master of Illusion tricks.  The tricks are pretty amateurish, naturally. These aren't David Blaine spectaclesthese are barely even Harry Blackstone or Doug Henning performances. But they're perfect for the younger crowd to wow their friends or parents with their skills of illusion.    You'll be an amateur magician in no time. Or in a couple of weeks depending on how long you take to unlock everything.   The way the tricks are explained is through still screens and artwork. You get the basic idea of the performance, but the whole idea of finesse and showmanship has to come from the player. Any poor performance can easily reveal how the tricks are done, so a lot of the ~issues~ of Master of Illusion isn't so much the package's problems, but of who does the tricks. But the game could have certainly done a better job demonstrating how the tricks could be performedmaybe through short video clips of someone who knows what they're doing.   The ~practice~ portion to strengthen your magic skills is as much of a stretch as the claim that Vision Training makes your eyeballs stronger. But these ~practices~ are cool Brain Age-style tasks, like trying to write a letter of the alphabet in a mirror image on the lower screen.    Actually, a lot of Master of Illusion is based around the Brain Age mentality: you can only open up so many portions of the product each day, based on the system clock. So unless you do the time travel thing and advance the internal date of the Nintendo DS, you'll spend quite a few days opening up all the tricks and treats of the package.Master of Illusion is today's generation of Magic Kits. There's certainly nothing wrong with trying to be an amateur magician, and this Nintendo DS product is a neat way to learn how some familiar illusions are performedand to see some cool variations of these tricks performed on a dual-screen, touch screen handheld. But if you have no interest in performing these tricks for others, you'll completely miss the point of the productand should skip it altogether.", "date": "Dec 4, 2007"}
