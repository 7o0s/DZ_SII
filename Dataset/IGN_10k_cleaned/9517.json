Try hard enough and you'll eventually get to the moon. Of course, ahead of that, you'll probably be lucky if you manage to leave the launch pad, let alone shoot 240 thousand miles into the air. And so we find Assassin's Creed, sitting destitute on the tarmac, frantically revving its engine. Sure, that's a damn fine rocket ship you've got there mister, but - you know - does it fly?   Given the huge grumbling avalanche of coverage Assassin's Creed has garnered since its unveiling, it's probably safe to assume you've got a fair idea of what Ubisoft's latest involves. Set in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade, you assume the role of Altair, disgraced assassin, sent to right his personal wrongs - and a few others in between - by taking the lives of nine men, three each in the cities of Damascus, Acre and Jerusalem, all apparently hell bent on bringing civilisation to its knees.   Here's how each of the nine assassination scenarios plays out: leave the guild, infiltrate the city, scale a tower, survey the area, locate the guild. Next, under the guise of collecting enough information to begin your assassination, you repeatedly climb towers, scan for investigation objectives and, if you're lucky enough to find any, complete the bare minimum and return to the guild. Sadly, aside from a seriously misjudged closing level, there's exactly no deviation from this formula at any stage of the game.   Free-running is undoubtedly one of the game's strong points.  To say Assassin's Creed is structurally repetitive would be an understatement. Where this becomes a problem though is that none of the tasks required are either particularly enjoyable or challenging and the whole thing reaches such levels of predictability and tedium that it actually become a chore to continue. Investigation tasks, for instance, come in a handful of variations. Interrogations involve waiting for someone to finish talking, following them for a bit then punching them repeatedly. Pickpocketting involves waiting for someone to finish talking, then following them with the B button held down. Meanwhile, eavesdropping requires you have a nice sit down, lock on to a target then simply wait for them to finish nattering. Really, the only interesting investigation tasks are those involving informants who'll only give you information once you complete a certain task within a time limit. Stealth killing a set number of targets is mildly compelling while running around rooftops collecting a bunch of misplaced flags is simply dumbfounding in its incongruousness.   Sadly, all this street time also highlights the generally superfluous, yet widely-touted guard alert system. Theoretically, you need to behave in an increasingly low-key manner as city security becomes aware of your presence throughout the game. In practice though, we had no trouble tearing through the streets and clambering up buildings in direct view of the law. Even when things get sticky too - generally completely arbitrarily, from our experience - it's not too hard to duck into one of the environment's many hiding spots, or hit blend, to quell any potential trouble.   Assassin's Creed is stunning from both a technical and artistic perspective.  Things don't fare much better when it comes to the assassinations themselves - what should have been the standout point in each chapter. With enough information at your disposal, it's off to a specific point on your map to watch an interminably heavy-handed cut-scene before giving chase and bringing your target to his knees. Unfortunately, despite its extraordinarily promising concept, none of these scenarios ever make much use of your assassination skills. What these scenarios need is some varied, intelligent design that really plays up to your skill set. Instead, the completely unscripted sequences mean it's almost always impossible to approach any of your targets from a stealthy perspective (in fact, the lack of any real stealth throughout the game is one of Assassin's Creeds more astonishing omissions) and you invariably find yourself hacking and slashing your way through an army of guards as your target either mills around within hitting distance or runs off in the other direction. Given that we killed the majority of targets completely by accident as we fought off the throng, it's a safe bet to assume no one's going to come away from a kill feeling either particularly empowered or satisfied.   Thankfully though, things pick up for the closing segment of each chapter. Following the death of your target, the city is placed on full alert and you're tasked with shaking off the guards and returning to the guild. These sections work because they actually play up to the environments' strengths, forcing you to assess and analyse your route through the streets and over the rooftops as your enemies follow in hot pursuit. They're tense in all the right ways and, thankfully, put Altair's acrobatics to good use.   Undoubtedly, Assassin's Creed's three cities (the less said about its almost wholly superfluous and largely forgettable Kingdom hub the better - horses or no horses), are the game's highlight. Whether on the ground or high above the city streets, we'd be hard pushed to think of another game that manages to convey such a vast, beautiful and believable sense of place and time quite so spectacularly. Every inch of the world is packed with a simply amazing level of detail, practically screaming out the toil and dedication of Ubisoft Montreal's art team.     Unquestionably, it's a stunning game from both a technical and artistic perspective. Whether it's the sprawling countryside, bustling streets or individual city districts, infused with their own unique personality, there's simply never a moment where the environments feel anything less than utterly tangible. Climb to the top of a tower and the seemingly endless city sprawl, still rendered with amazing clarity across huge distances, is enough to stop even the most jaded passerby in their tracks.   That you can literally clamber, climb and explore every inch of the world - hiding in secluded backstreets or scaling the highest tower - is even sweeter. Perhaps though, Assassin's Creed's crowning achievement is its control scheme which logically pares your movement set (and more-than-competent combat engine) down to the bare minimum, offering a set-up that makes traversing the enormous environments an incredibly fluid, exhilarating experience. Sure, Altair's semi-autonomous instincts can prove frustrating in the game's more heated moments but, for the most part, it's an incredibly elegant solution to a hugely complex issue.   Horses are used solely to traverse the huge, if redundant, Kingdom hub.  In game terms though, it's clear that cities have been designed with an emphasis on form rather than function. This becomes all too obvious as the game constantly forces you back into the ether, repeatedly and tediously scanning for investigation tasks. For all the densely packed, scalable architecture on display, there's little in the way of concession to fun, with apparently little thought given as to whether cities make for entertaining playgrounds. Skipping over the fact that's there's almost no impetus to explore the world beyond progressing through the story - unless you either like repetitive investigation tasks or really, really love collecting randomly discarded flags - there are maybe one of two instances of genuine design brilliance we wish Ubisoft had used as a template for the rest of the game.   Most memorably, the city of Acre features a huge cathedral offering the highest vantage point and, subsequently, most stunning vista, of the game. Actually getting to the top demands a fairly sizeable amount of creativity as you scan the area for promising outcrops, plotting your route ahead. Its complexity makes it feels like a self-contained puzzle and is all the more satisfying for it. Quite why nobody realised this was exactly the direction the game needed to go in is mystifying although, hopefully, we'll see more of this in Assassin's Creeds inevitable sequels.   Combat is satisfying and offers surprising depth, if not enough to stave off monotony.  On a final note, if you've gotten this far, you'll have noticed we've glazed over Assassin's Creed's not-very-secret sci-fi tangents. Without wanting to spoil anything,  it's a frankly unnecessary and utterly jarring addition to the promising yet ultimately disappointing storyline, but not completely without its merits. Firstly, it contains the only vaguely rounded, relatable characters in the entire game. Secondly, it has a nice sideline in playable optional challenges between chapters. By messing around in the lab, you'll uncover some slight adventure-style elements - gaining passwords to computers, offering access to emails and, thus, back story, for instance. It's hardly the most riveting thing in the world but does make us wonder whether this more structured sense of exploration would have benefited the lacklustre investigation elements of the main game.Ultimately, where Assassin's Creed succeeds is in its most basic form - a vast, believable world to explore freely, a place teeming with life and intoxicating beauty. As an experience, it's undoubtedly a bold, brave and distinctly unique creation - exactly what this generation of consoles has promised from the beginning. In that sense, it's an incredible achievement and one that deserves recognition - we'd even go as far as to suggest Assassin's Creed is an experience everyone should investigate purely to see what's in store for the future of the industry, if only from a presentation and tech perspective.As a game though, Assassins Creed fails in just about every respect. That sense of freedom offered aside, its design is hopelessly outdated at best and laborious to the point of perpetual boredom at worst. Once the initial lustre of Assassins Creeds world wears off after a few hours, whats left is a flimsy, soulless gameplay experience, struggling under the weight of a painfully ponderous, woefully hackneyed narrative which only serves to drag things down further.  That said, the score below reflects Assassins Creeds unquestionable achievements as much as it does its failing. Hopefully, next time, Ubisoft Montreal will give us the game to match its commendable ambition.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
