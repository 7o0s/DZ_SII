But perhaps this whole import frenzy thing has gotten a little out of hand with the release of D2 in the US, a visually compelling but gaming snoozefest that will make you wonder exactly why Sega brought the title over to the states in the first place.  If you're looking for a solid sequel to the original D, you're not about to get one  but then again, if you played the original spooky-but-confusing Myst clone, you probably aren't going to be all that surprised that its sequel far from resembles the original. In D2 you play as Laura, a businesswoman who looks more like a tourist who ends up being more like the world's savior, and who inexplicably seems to live in a universe where she's completely mute, but no one ever asks ~why the hell won't you just say something?~ She does talk by the way, though ~off camera.~ Another inexplicable Warp quirk, I suppose. As you probably know from the preview, the game covers a lot of loopy fantasy/science territory, starting with the hijacking of the plane Laura's on by two violent terrorists, and then heading (literally  the plane crashes) into the arctic wilderness of Canada, which also houses some local research centers and a lot of important clues as to why the dead passengers are turning into monsters, and why Laura's compact just happens to glow like the doorway in Poltergeist.  Once the game begins, it's up to you and your friend Kimberly Fox to figure out why innocent people are being turned into hideous monsters, how Laura survived eight days in the snow without a blanket or even good Legg's pantyhose, and how they're going to find help. And oh yeah, you've got to hunt animals with your rifle and roast 'em on your ~portable cooker.~ You didn't think this game was going to be free of Japanese wackiness, did you?  The minute you step out of the cabin where the game begins, you'll experience the best and the worst parts of the game at once. It's incredibly beautiful, with the snow drifts misting around you realistically, the vehicles and objects full of extraordinary detail, and the monsters full of more gory details than even Codename Veronica. Unfortunately, once you start trudging, you'll also experience the monotony and snail-pacing that bog this game down. I can answer the first question you'll be asking already  yes, you'll have to walk all the way over there, and then all the way back, and then all the way to that other place and then all the way back to the first place again. Twice. Snow may look pretty at first, but once you start hiking through it for twenty minutes, it quickly loses its luster. What makes matters worse is that Warp seems to enjoy cutscenes so much that even the non-boring (AKA, non-walking) parts of the game are made just that by having to show you, in interminable detail, every little action undertaken by Laura. Every first aid spray she finds in a drawer, every object she notices, and every door she opens must be played out in 10 to 15 second cutscenes.  As for story, this is one of the most adult games I've ever played, with a plotline that covers everything from poetry and evolution to drug addiction, and told with a sobriety and violence more shocking than your average Quentin Tarantino script. Add to that the insane amount of phallic references in the game, and you've got yourself a console title that has truly been made for adults  which may be why there's just so much damn dialogue in the game.  The storyline may have worked better if the pacing were tighter, but it seems as though Sega spent all of its time making sure that the tentacle sex wasn't visible, completely ignoring the seconds upon seconds of dead space that pads every phrase, sentence, or monologue. If the voice acting was completely out of sync with the character's lips, it might have worked better than what D2 delivers in its final American form. Characters will sync up with the spoken dialogue for a moment or two, and then suddenly slide completely out of sync, the most classic example being when a character's lips move before and after a sentence for one or two seconds.  Attacks are a mixed bag  for the first few fights, you'll be excited by the mixture of classic RPG gameplay with first person action. To kill the bloomers, you'll have to aim at their weak points, react quickly to their movements, and know when to reload your weapons without leaving yourself open to attacks. Unlike most shooters however, you can also take the time to cycle through your inventory and use health sprays and meat, or change the gun you'd like to use. Unfortunately, the repetitive nature of the battles (which is unavoidable considering their simplicity) won't hold you anywhere near as well as the classic RPG gameplay of Grandia II, or the button-mashing action that you'll get when fighting zombies in Code Veronica. There just isn't enough complexity or variety to keep you interested, especially when your only joy after finishing a battle is in knowing that you'll have to walk through snow again for another five minutes.  As for the adventure elements, it's mostly a matter of simply writing down a number in one area, or finding a key, and bringing it to another area. If you have the item that's needed to progress, then Laura will automatically bring it out as well, taking away most of the challenge, and leaving you with a Myst interface and speed without any of the brain-puzzlers. D2 ends up with all the worst aspects of a badly translated foreign film  it doesn't quite make sense, the lips never sync up right, and the pacing will bore you to tears. While there was definitely potential in the way that Warp wanted to tell the story of D2, the end product suffers specifically because of the game's unrelenting dependence on dragging you through every tiny detail of the plot. Despite it's minimal and haunting score, despite some very mature subject matter, and despite some of the prettiest graphics to hit the Dreamcast in months, D2 turns out to be mostly a dud.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Aug 23, 2000"}
