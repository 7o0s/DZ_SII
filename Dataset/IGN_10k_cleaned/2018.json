{"name": "Atari Anniversary Edition", "name_review": "Atari Anniversary Edition", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/10/atari-anniversary-edition", "text": "I'd have to say that Atari was just as responsible for my upbringing as either of my parents was. Oh sure, they fed me and bathed me and cared for me for the first 7 or 8 years of my life, but did either of them ever let me carve my name and high score on their foreheads? No.   I guess my point is that Atari was a big part of my growing up. From their arcade hits like Pole Position and Asteroids, to the famed Atari 2600 console, I probably spent more time with Atari-branded products as a child than I did with anything that was a Transformer or a Lincoln Log.   That's why Infogrames' new $15 Atari Anniversary Edition (we're not really sure what anniversary they're celebrating) is such a blast. It takes you back to the halcyon 1970s days, and puts you squarely in the mitts of favorites like Asteroids, Centipede, and Gravitar.  The front end of the game is fairly elegant, and allows you to choose your game easily. In the front end, you also can choose your keyboard setup, and whether you want to use the mouse or a joystick instead to control the action. And surprisingly, controlling some of these games with the mouse is superior to the original controls.  The game's graphics are top-notch, as far as emulation goes. If you come in expecting to see 2001-style 3D-accelerated graphics, you've come to the wrong place. This is all about recreating the look and feel of the old arcade classics, and the game does it perfectly.  Everything, from the raster look of the centipede creeping toward your shooter to the vector-ized asteroids floating slowly toward your triangular ship is recreated with 1979 perfection.  The title's sounds are top-notch, too. All the bleeps, bloops and blips you remember from these classics are here, recreated in perfect form.  I'm sure just about everyone knows how these games work, so I won't go into great detail about the 12 games in the collection. But for those of you born after 1980 or so, I'll do a quick run-down:   Asteroids: You control a space ship in the middle of an asteroid field, a la The Empire Strikes Back. You must shoot all the asteroids into smaller rocks, and then blow those up, too. In the meantime, watch for little UFOs that will occasionally emerge to take pot shots at you.   Asteroids Deluxe: The same as Asteroids, only deluxe! Actually, the big change in gameplay in this one is the addition of the shield for temporary protection from the asteroids and the UFOs.   Battlezone:  In a vector graphics world (its all green lines, baby) you are the commander of a tank that must shoot first, and ask questions later. Kill enemy tanks, and other hovering ships to clear the levels.   Centipede: You are the exterminator, and it's your job to rid the garden of tons of pesky bugs. The big enemy is, of course, the centipede, which snakes his way down toward your shooter as the game progresses. Other enemies you'll face include the spider, flea, and scorpion. Don't let anything touch you, because they'll kill you instantly.   Crystal Castles: You play a cute, little teddy bear who must grab all the crystals he can, as fast as he can. Played in an isometric perspective, you must make your way around all the walls on top of a castle to grab the crystals before your enemies (like trees and bees) do.   Gravitar: While the graphics are Asteroids-like, Gravitar is a very different game. You must explore several planets, each with its own gravitational field. Some have nasty, heavy gravity, that you must overcome to shoot and destroy enemy installations. Trouble is, gravity is always pulling you towards the ground -- crash into the ground and you die.   Millipede: The sequel to Centipede, this one is just like its predecessor, only it has more enemies you must face, and there also are DDT canisters you can shoot to help you destroy more of the bugs.   Missile Command: The first doomsday game, Missile Command puts you in charge of three missile silos to try and defend your planet against an all-out attack by IPBMs (Inter-Planetary Ballistic Missiles). Blow up all the incoming missiles before they destroy your cities, and you move on to the next level, let your cities get destroyed, and the game is over.   Pong: The classic that started it all. It is essentially video tennis. You control one paddle and the computer (or another player) controls the other. Bat the ball back and forth until someone misses it. Whoever misses the ball, their opponent gets a point. First player to 11 points wins the game.   Super Breakout: It is your mission, should you choose to accept it, to bust out of an walled-in enclosure, using only your paddle and a bouncing ball. When your ball hits the bricks at the top of the screen, it eliminates those bricks. Keep bouncing the ball against the bricks, and eventually, you'll bust out of the wall. It doesn't sound like much, but it is very addictive.   Tempest: Another vector graphics classic. You spin your shooter around several oddly-shaped playing fields. You must shoot the enemies that emerge from the center of the field, all the while spinning around. Touch an enemy, and you die. Too many things traveling around your field to survive? Use the SuperZapper, and it will eliminate all of your enemies. Trouble is, you only get one SuperZapper per round.   Warlords: Another fine game that gave you a reason to own paddle controllers for the Atari 2600. You protect one of four kings in the game, one in each corner of the screen. Shoot fireballs at the other kings, which, like yours, is protected by a thick wall. One hit with the fireball will break a brick in the wall, and eventually you'll get a clear shot at the king. Kill the other kings before your king is eliminated, and you win and move to the next round.  In addition to the games, the package also offers some compelling additional content. Included on the disc are desktop themes in the vein of these games, which are well done. Also on the disc are some pieces of Atari history, including some press releases from the old days, as well as photos of some old Atari promotional materials (many of which I wouldn't mind having in my personal collection). Also included is an interview with Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari. The interview is split up into several pieces, and cut into pertinent topics such as Bushnell's feelings on being considered the father of video games, as well as how he marketed the Atari 2600 in the early days. It's very interesting for anyone remotely interested in video games. And we know you are, otherwise, why in the hell would you be reading this site?  When it gets right down to it, the Atari Anniversary Edition faithfully recreates these games just as you remember them. And isn't that the point, after all? Even better, the control on your PC is probably better than the controls on the original games. So what's not to love?  As a nice little diversion, the Atari Anniversary Edition excels. It definitely deserves a place on your game shelf, if not for the sheer gameplay, at the very least for the history it documents. And for $15, how can you go wrong?  -- Mike Morrissey Want to share your opinions with the world?
