It's an acquired taste, but the fans just totally get into the sport  and that's why companies such as Ubi Soft create videogame versions of the sport. Monaco Grand Prix has seen versions on the PC, Nintendo 64, and Dreamcast (at least in Japan so far), and now it's available on the PlayStation to go up against the biggest system hitter in the genre, Psygnosis' Formula One. We have a new winner.  Gameplay  Let's be frank  this isn't an arcade racer. To really play the game you have to get into the innerworkings of how the cars operate. That means figuring out weight distribution, tire slickness, down and updraft, gearbox ratios, under and oversteer, and suspension. Learning how each of these elements affect the cars is key to succeeding in the game. You honestly can't have a lead foot and expect the vehicle to do what you want it to do. This is an attempt at realism, and this is how the cars react in real life.  Monaco Grand Prix features 16 international courses, from the licensed Monaco track to circuits in Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Canada, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The game doesn't have the player licenses, but the names are a few letters off so Ubi Soft didn't have to pay the fee. Instead, they give you the option to rename all the players in the game and save them onto a memory card. Just don't expect to see the same sponsor stickers on the vehicles of the players you're renaming.  The big deal about Monaco Grand Prix is its physics model. The game features a four-wheel independent suspension system that calculates all four tires as individuals. Meaning if only your front right wheel hits the grass, you'll find your car reacting in a different way than if your rear wheels have entered the field.  You'll also be able to change the settings of your front and rear wings, gearbox, suspension, and fuel tank. The problem here is, the interface isn't the greatest  for example, when you adjust your wing angles, it's not graphically represented to show how steep the angle is. It would have been helpful if you could see what you were changing.  The main option in Monaco Grand Prix is the Championship, where you take one character on a circuit of all 16 tracks. Each race you enter you win points, 10 points for first all the way down to 1 point for sixth. And when there's 21 opponents on the circuit, it's not going to be easy. And with the added element of rain entering the game, it's one hell of a challenge.  But even with all the focus on realism, it isn't to say that Ubi Soft hasn't given the casual gamers their own racing option  one of the first menu choices is ~Arcade.~ The intense physics model is thrown out the window, and you're left with a timed, three lap race against 21 other opponents. The problem here is, in arcade mode, the opponent AI is almost the same as in the standard simulation mode, so even though you've got superhuman abilities to take out the opponents, they won't do the same to you. They'll just follow the groove in the track and let you pass, even though damage isn't turned on. This makes Arcade mode a rather dull and easy option to play. But thankfully the difficulty increases with each track you unlock in this mode.  In Time Attack mode, you can even choose to play in Ghost mode  this will bring up a ~ghost~ of your car after every lap completed, showing every little move your car made in the previous lap. Believe it or not, this is a great educational tool, especially if you want to learn how to turn on each track's curve.  Graphics  Ubi Soft really put together an amazing graphics engine for Monaco Grand Prix  silky smooth framerate that rarely slows down, even with the mob of cars on-screen at once. Marvel at the sight of grass spewing from the tires when your car swerves into the field! Thrill at the image of skid marks and smoke during a spinout! The detail of the trackside objects is also very colorful and sharp. And if you look carefully, you can see the lightsourcing that's cast on the vehicle chassis. The only real complaint here is the pop-up of far away objects as you're driving. It's a mild distraction, but it's pretty obvious how Ubi Soft was able to keep such a high framerate on such a detailed game.   Sound  Well, if you like the sound of a weedwhacker revving for hours on end, you'll enjoy the audio content of Monaco Grand Prix. Hey, that's what Formula One cars sound like when you're right up against the engine. But it can get annoying to those around you  case in point, the Daily Movies editor had to make a specific trip behind me as I was playing, just to hum loudly in my ear  simulating what he was hearing as he worked in his cubicle. Yeah, well, deal with it. It's 22 cars driving really fast. It's not Mozart. Of all the options in the game, it doesn't feel as thorough as it could have been. The interface to adjust your vehicle's settings could have definitely been better, and the game would have been great had it featured a more detailed instant replay option (the only way you can see a replay is to finish the race and select the option  you cannot rewind, pause, or fast-forward). And the arcade mode is a little on the easy side because of the AI  so if you're just a casual gamer, you may want to steer clear of this game.However, the fans of the sport (you know who you are) will find lots to like here. Yes, there's no real license except for the Monaco name. But if you're knowledgeable enough you can enter all the circuit racers names and save 'em to a card. But you can tweak the car to your liking and to milk a few KPHs out of the performance. And you know you like that.What's more, the game also has a multiplayer mode, two-player split screen, as well as two-to-four player link-up mode. Now that's the way to do it.As far as Formula One games go, Ubi Soft is the best on the PlayStation, though it still could use a few more options.", "date": "Jul 16, 1999"}
