It's the intangible nature that gives you dreams of pieces coming together and can make you want to run back to play another round because you just thought of some new combo. When that question is applied to Gunpey it quickly becomes obvious that the answer to that question is a definite ~no.~ Instead of a game you will want to play for just a couple minutes that expand into half an hour this is one that quickly fades away.   The format in Gunpey is ~classic puzzle~ with five columns in the playfield and upward-scrolling tiles coming in from the bottom. Once they hit the top it's game over. There are four different tiles, each one with a diagonal line or a bracket like the one sitting on top of the 6-key on your keyboard. To clear the tiles you need to line up the tiles so that the lines on them come together to connect the left and right wall. The most basic move is to get five tiles lined up so that a simple line goes across. This lights it up and makes it disappear.    Naturally, there are more complicated moves to pull off. Instead of going straight across, it's possible to crate a line that zigs and zags and loops and splits, but must always be connected. Any dead ends in the line won't be deleted. This can create a large combo within one line. And since there is a little bit of time to move the tiles around you can add to a glowing line to make it bigger or connect a separate line at the same time for more points.    Moving the tiles around is a clumsy process of moving a rectangle around the screen that can highlight two tiles at the same time, one on top of the other. Tapping the swap-button switches the two highlighted tiles. If there's just one tile inside the rectangle, then that one piece will move to the empty spot. This system leads to tapping away furiously at the d-pad and swap buttons to move the tiles around, way too much tapping. Getting the right pieces in the right place requires too much work for the game to be fun.   It doesn't help any further that the single-player challenge is basically a marathon of endurance where it's worth going for the bigger combos not for the points, but just to get to the next background theme, called a ~skin,~ a little bit faster. In Gunpey, the only things worth fighting for are the different and bizarre skins and songs in the game. But these are only accessed by playing for an extremely long time and then finding some untapped reserve of patience and a lack of anything else to do to play even further. And then you're rewarded for your efforts by getting a new background where a visibly pained dog shoots worms out of his butt. I wish I was kidding about that one.   The gameplay is so slow and boring and who cares about seeing a crapping dog? The only other reason to create massive combos, besides the skins, is that the rest of the action is mind numbingly dull. I tried to play through to get more skins, but after playing for half an hour I couldn't fight the desire to do something, anything, else and I would quit. There were far too few moments where I felt like I was flying close to the edge to pull off a move of the gods. Mostly the feeling here is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle with a slight buzz from a strong cup of tea.   To make it worse, it's as if the developers didn't care either since the rest of the production is pretty meager. The other features in Gunpey extend the playing experience a little, but it's not enough. There's a Double Skin mode where you can swap between two concurrent playfields which is kind of interesting, but the better feature is the Gunpey 10x10 mode where the playfield is 10 spaces wide. Here you can create huge combos almost without trying, but now you're navigating an even larger field with exponentially more button taps.    As for multiplayer you can play an ad hoc game, which is smooth, but it still fails to get very exciting. While playing against Juan Castro I had more fun making fun of his haircut than in whupping him in game after game. A drab puzzle game with two people is like sharing a stale croissant, all you can do is make fun of how tasteless it is.   After exploring the bland yet bizarre world of Gunpey there is one final aspect of the game that is like a final kick to the groin of anyone who wants to play it. This is the sad fact that there is no autosave function. The only thing more fun than spending 40 minutes to unlock a new theme is to turn off the PSP and realize that all your progress is lost. Thanks, guys!There are up to 40 different skins to collect in Gunpey, but the game itself simply isn't strong or fun enough to merit collecting more than six, if even that many. It would be fantastic if Gunpey could stand next to either of the Lumines games or Meteos and keep the puzzle genre going strong, but it isn't up to the task. It's not even close.", "date": "Nov 14, 2006"}
