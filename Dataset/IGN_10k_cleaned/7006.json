And if these threats weren't enough, the evil Martians are using the cosmic debris as cover for launching a full-scale assault on our planet. Earth's only hope is you, a reckless hero -- operator of the Global Defense Station laser cannon, the creation of scientists locked in a bunker for far too long. Do you have the wits and the will to repel the phalanx of extinction-causers? Because if not... Boom Goes the Earth. Well, Boom Goes the Earth 3D.   Boom Goes the Earth 3D is the first major release from Punch Entertainment, a mobile game developer and publisher created by former Lavastorm Engineering, uh, engineers. It's an action-puzzler with a very creative approach but some insane difficulty that could keep some casual gamers at bay. Some of the difficulty comes from the straight-up toughness of the alien attacks. The skies fill with menaces from the big beyond and once you're free of the warm-up levels, the game shows no mercy. But there are a couple design elements that also bump Boom's accessibility out of the range of the absolute masses, such as the smallness of the target cursor.   You control a laser cannon and a shield at the same time. The cannon's crosshair is positioned at the center of a small shield grid, each shield tile independent of the others. The shield can be used to deflect incoming threats, like asteroids, by moving the cannon cursor around so a particular shield tile is positioned to ~catch~ the blow. Each strike on the individual tile weakens it, and after a particularly grueling assault, your shield will have gaping holes in it. This ratchets up the toughness, because you have to be very conscious of the broken tiles as well as the incoming objects. It can get to be a little much, especially because the camera angle really lops off a lot of the advance warning of incoming enemies -- at least, on a vertically oriented screen.   I have played the game on both an LG VX8000 and the horizontal VX9800 (Verizon has tried to position this handset as ~the V~) and had a much easier time on the 9800. You get an extra couple seconds of seeing the attacks coming in and it grants you just enough time to really plot your next few moves. On the 8000, the game goes from easy to hard to ~dammit!~ fairly quickly because the screen orientation slices so much of the view out of the screen. Punch was wise not to sacrifice the size of the planet on the vertical screen, but the expense is really quite great.   When objects stream toward Earth, there is a small shaft of colored dots that point down to the surface, showing you the threat trajectory. If you want to blow up the threat with the cannon -- and there is an entire side element of prioritizing targets -- you position the crosshairs at the end of the trajectory. This can get kinda confusing in later levels when the atmosphere is thick with impending doom. Punch makes things slightly easier by turning the crosshair red when you've lined up with a target. It's a smart addition that saves the game in many respects, because when you have five or six trajectories pointing toward the planet coupled with the camera angle (slightly skewed to the side), it can be tough to fire accurate shots in time to destroy certain targets, like UFOs, that can withstand more than one blast.   Your task is made slightly more manageable by a series of power-ups, such as the Shield Charge that replenishes tiles and the Gravity Well, which slows things down. The Nuke causes damage to all incoming threats.   Boom goes for a 1950s sci-fi look -- and succeeds. The action is interrupted by comic book-style screens that further the story. The HUD looks like it was designed by a B-movie art director saying, ~Just put science-looking stuff around.~ The game screen is clean (until the trajectories start filling the atmosphere) and I really like how the action moves around the globe with each stage. The sound effects and music are also pure cheese -- fun, delicious cheese.  Players that download Boom Goes the Earth 3D on a device with a horizontal screen will definitely have an advantage over other players. Shearing off some of the game screen really increases the difficulty in later stages -- almost unfairly. Maybe if Punch had permanently positioned the earth on the bottom of the screen, giving us more usable playing field in each level, I would have liked the game a little more. As it is, Boom is a clever riff on Missile Command with a neat B-movie look, but I got too frustrated too fast.", "date": "Jun 19, 2006"}
