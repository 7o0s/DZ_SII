Once the best place to go for racing games it appears that our fully-built ultimate gaming machines don't see as much playtime on the virtual tarmac anymore. We still get games like Need for Speed Underground, Colin McRae 04,  and Pro Race Driver, but miss out on the  Burnout 3s and Gran Turismos of the world. There is recourse for the PC raceboy, Codemasters' TOCA Race Driver 2; it's just a good bit of news for anyone interesting in a bit of seat time behind some solid racers.   One of our favorites was Codemasters' Pro Race Driver. It still is as good as racing gets on the Xbox for the circuit driver. We gave the game a score of 8.9 citing, ~[It] is easily one of the top racing titles on Xbox even if it doesn't have Xbox Live functionality and role-playing elements.~ Hell, it's easily one of the top racing titles on PC, too.  Apparently, good enough isn't good enough for Codemasters, the publisher-developer behind the simmy track racer. Codie is aiming to make the second time the charm with ToCA Race Driver 2. Don't let the silly name convention fool you; it's the true sequel to last year's outing.  Features Head-to-head PC online functionality.  31 licensed and fictional global race locations offering 48 tracks including  Hockenheim from the German DTM series and Surfers Paradise from the Australian V8 series.  35 high performance cars, including Ford GT, Aston Martin Vanquish, Jaguar XKR, Nissan Skyline GT-R and AMG-Mercedes CLK.  First person interactive story line.  Up to 21 cars on the track at once, battling for position.  All-new render engine, which allows for 60 frame per second graphics. Gameplay If the gameplay isn't there, there is no game, especially for wheel-to-wheel racing. Fortunately, ToCA Race Driver 2 picks up where Pro Race Driver left off. The cumbersome, semi-lackluster role-playing element has been all but removed, replaced by a more conventional career mode--still with rendered cinematics to break up the action. It's a nice touch that we're seeing in more and more racing games, adding a bit of human interaction and whole lot of personality to prevent the sterile pace of racing from getting, well, too sterile. But the flash isn't what ToCA Race Driver 2 is about; it's a racing game and that's where the game shines like a freshly polished gem.    It's no secret that ToCA Race Driver 2 won't appeal to everyone. But if you played the first game, you'll be immediately familiar with the simulation-esque control and physics model. If beating the pants of other players in Need for Speed Undeground has you psyched about your driving skills, be prepared for a shocker; drifting an RX-7, Supra or other super import isn't as easy as you think and ToCA Race Driver 2 on PC will test those skills the way GT4 will on PS2.   Grab hold of a decent PC-compatible steering wheel and the virtual world of tarmac, marbles, exhaust and tire smoke comes to life. Car handling is convincing yet remains fun. Give it too much gas a bit too early and you'll surely spin a mid-engine, rear-drive car like the Ford GT. Take a car like the Evo or STi on the tarmac and the same bad form will cause understeer--exactly what should happen. The tweaking is just that good. To untrained hands ToCA might seem a bit unforgiving, but give it a little time and you, too, will appreciate the depth involved with following the proper line and successfully shaving seconds of lap times.       Like other racing games, ToCA Race Driver 2 features realistic vehicle damage. So realistic, in fact, that you can lose a race because of engine failure or other mechanical issues. This is a new feature exclusive to ToCA Race Driver 2 and wasn't implemented in the original Race Driver.  ToCA does prevent foul play, but has found a better and far more satisfying way of stopping slop-drivers than other games. Tap a car, guardrail or other object with a wheel and the ailment might go awry, sending the vehicle to one side or another. Hit someone or something too hard and you're outta the race, be it from a broken axle, busted wheel or straight up engine or tranny failure. It's a fantastic touch that makes one appreciate racing seriously. This will, undeniably, force online players to use a much more finesse and less brute force as they plow throw the twisty turns of ToCA.   But ToCA isn't without flaws. Take the interface, for instance, if you want to do a quick race with a buddy ToCA forces one to choose a type of series, a vehicle in that series then the track--instead of using the generally standard, ~choose a track, choose a car~ format Race Driver 2. It's horribly confusing and there are better ways to setup this portion of the game. This is especially frustrating if, say, you want to take the Jaguar on Nurburgring. This semi-minor flaw aside, the interface is much better than before with less going on and less confusion between races; it's just one after another. Everything else is straight-forward, just how we like it.  As much as we dislike a few of ToCA Race Driver 2's interface issues we are highly impressed with the inclusion of almost every motorsport under the sun. One minute we play with some DTMs, the next we're up for a bit of convertible racing or straight to open wheel. While there aren't hundreds of vehicles, the selection of racing is more than sufficient to keep anyone busy for a very long time.    We fully expect online communities to sprout based on specific race and vehicle types. Some players might just wanna go at it with the open-wheel formulas, others may choose V8s, supercars or big-rig racing. We have yet to decide.     Graphics ToCA may not dethrone other games with bright graphics, but it does hold up fairly well. Environments don't have the visual polish that we've seen in previously-mentioned games. Courses are bright, colorful and look good enough from arm's length, but take a closer look and you'll notice rumble strips are prisms protruding from the ground with simple textures. Trees are billboards with textures slapped onto two-dimensional sprites and grass looks like something we'd pick out of an Easter basket.   Regardless, the graphics do hold up fairly well, especially when it comes to in-game car models. Each of the vehicles shine like a recently washed car (we get our vehicles at IGN washed by Wally's Carwash), but bash that beautiful ride headlong into a wall and it'll crush, crumple and deform like a real car would. Shards of glass, pieces of metal and even tires will fly off the car depending on the severity of the hit. And since this visual deformation translates to a vehicle that is less responsive or eventually doesn't work, you'll want to keep these rides as clean as possible      Missing are additional third-person perspectives--there's only one. We would have preferred at least two. First person is covered with not one, but up three different angles: bumper-cam, hood and, we like this last one, driver cam. The last camera mimics drive-specific sides. That is, drive a European or Japanese car and the orientation will be right-hand drive (most of the hood will be on the left); drive an American-spec car and orientation will be that of a left-hand drive car. But the most impressive part about the camera system has to be how it reacts. Thank Need for Speed Underground's over-the-top presentation during drag races for pushing the envelope. In ToCA Race Driver 2 you can almost feel the suspension compressing and decompressing as you go through whoops with rally cars or accidentally hop over rumble strips in first-person perspective. Vehicle hoods even vibrate slightly against the wind. It's a far cry from the days when first-person perspective felt like nothing more than a floating camera.   Sound Getting the sound right in a racing game is a sort of black art. There's a lot involved in the process and not many are aware of how hard it really is to get a vehicle to sound like what you hear when driving for real. It's not just the sound of a blasting engine, but the wind against the car, the sound of the exhaust behind you, the tires against the tarmac--all these things add up to the sounds we hear.   Someone at Codemasters is listening, too. Sound is excellent and hearing the stereophonic sounds of a wailing engine, smoking tires or rumble strips is hot. Occasional comments from the pit aren't frequent enough to become annoying but add to the overall experience, as do the sound of crashing metal and glass against metal.   Our friends in Europe have obviously been listening to our pleas as ToCA Race Driver 2 features head-to-head online support. A true sequel, but more of an '04 update, ToCA Race Driver 2 takes what we liked about the previous game and adds new cars, new tracks, improved gameplay and better visuals.  Normally the question would be does a sequel with 35 cars, 48 tracks and a lot of the same stuff warrant a purchase? For the car buff, yeah, it does--new cars plus additional tracks and we're sold. But even if motor oil doesn't course through your veins there's no doubt that ToCA Race Driver 2 is not only an amazing game, but worth the buy. The physics are amazing, the visuals just as good and the cars--well, they're race cars, new and old. Let's not forget the nearly 50 venues to race in.  Yeah, some might complain that 35 cars isn't enough, but I'd rather have 35 smokin' cars than a bunch of crappy ones. C'mon, it's on the cheap and nearly a budget game.", "date": "Oct 22, 2004"}
