In fan's minds, owners are despicable, greedy, bottom-of-the-barrel and borderline insane creatures who charge twenty bucks for beer, raise ticket prices every season, lockout players during labor negotiations, and the second there's a hint of fan disloyalty, threaten to move the club to whatever city will make them even more millions in their lifelong pursuit of Bentleys, mansions, and enough cheddar to make their rat-heads spin. If you've ever wanted to trade places with the haves and force your favorite owner into the world of have-nots, Baseball Mogul 2004 is the game for you.  For those unfamiliar with the Mogul series, the game's about simming the experiences of an owner and General Manager, not about actually playing nine innings of ball. You sign free agents, trade players, set your lineup, and sim games...everything you see in typical franchise modes in games like MVP Baseball. What separates Baseball Mogul is the fact that beyond the day-to-day lineup manipulations and trades, you're actually managing the entire franchise's budget, from the price of beer and parking all the way up to manipulating the money spent on developing your farm system. The more successful you are at making money, the more money you'll have to spend on free agents to help drive your team to the title. But it can work the opposite way as well. Your team can struggle because you made a bad trade, which affects attendance, which affects the amount of people buying peanuts, which means you make less per year, which means you have no money to improve your team in the off season. It's a dizzying snowball like situation that makes you scratch your head as you're forced to slash the budget of your minor league operations and jack up the price for parking. The longer you play, the more you begin to tinker with various business developments in order to take your team to the next level. Before you know it, what seemed like twenty minutes turned into about five hours and you realize just how hooked on the game you really are.  For baseball junkies, you'll find not only the day-to-day operations intriguing, but the chance to take one of your favorite teams of all time (real players and teams going back to 1900) and change history by winning the championship, somewhat overwhelming. That's where the real money in Mogul lies. For once, the Cubs and Red Sox can be just as dominant as the Yankees. In fact, you can change history so dramatically you can actually turn the storied Yankees into a franchise that more resembles the beleaguered Brewers.  My favorite team growing up was the 1984 Chicago Cubs, so that's where I started. Bob Dernier leads off and plays center field, Ryan Sandberg at second, ~The Penguin~ Ron Cey holding down the hot corner, Larry Bowa at short, and ~The Bull~ Leon Durham playing first. Sure, this Cubs team teased the city of Chicago into thinking they could win it all, but like all Cubs teams, this one faltered down the stretch and won absolutely nothing. But not when I'm in control, I thought. No way.  Yes way. No matter what I did, I couldn't make this team a winner. Even by calling up Shawon Dunston and Greg Maddux from the minors, my team struggled like, well, the Cubs. I realized a few seasons into the game that to make the 1984 Cubs a winner, I needed to start my franchise in about 1979 and build up my squad from there. It took me five seasons to finally win the championship as an owner, but it was more through knowing the future than being a wise businessman. I basically stole Cecil Fielder and Jose Canseco from their respective teams while they were still in the minors (hey, it pays to know your history) and made the Cubs the best hitting team in the majors. I also signed Roger Clemens to big money to stabilize my pitching staff while basically stripping my minor league system of all funds in order to sign these players to long-term contracts. Even with limited funds, though, my minor league team provided me with a left fielder who slugged 40 homers, and a pitcher who won 18 games a year. Only problem was that when I went to the championship game, I played the White Sox, but the way the tournament menu is laid out it's by city name, not team name. So when the menu flashed ~Chicago wins!~ it took me a minute to actually figure out that I actually won the series.  What did you think of Baseball Mogul 2004?  Looking back, however, you can take my manipulation of history one of two ways: The game is fun because I was able to change history using my knowledge of players and trading for the best, or, the game is not fun because I already knew who was going to be a superstar and it's easy to win a title when the game is somewhat fixed. The thing is, I signed a lot of other so-called big names from the era, and they ended up playing like scrubs. Sure, they all have potential, but once you start your franchise, these guys are all just names with potential, and not everyone works out like you think. So not only do you get to change history, you actually get a kind of do-over. If only players like Tom O'Malley had that chance in real life. As sports simulations advance to the next stages, games like this will be more of a mode in a playable game like MVP than a complete game onto itself. As much fun as it is to manipulate rosters and charge people an arm and a cleat for cold beer, you never get over the fact that you want to play the games instead of just watching their results. Still, with over a hundred years of baseball covered, Baseball Mogul is a must-have for all fans of America's favorite pastime. The Cubs win the pennant! Only in my dreams, and games like Baseball Mogul. One thing's for sure, though, being an owner is a lot harder than it looks.", "date": "Apr 30, 2003"}
