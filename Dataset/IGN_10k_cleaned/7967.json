{"name": "Europa Universalis 3", "name_review": "Europa Universalis III Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/24/europa-universalis-iii-review", "text": "Paradox Interactive's Europa Universalis easily one of the most ambitious historical strategy game series ever. While it doesn't have the approachability of games like Civilization or Total War, it manages to convey a scale and pace of historical strategy that's as appealing as it is wholly unique. Letting players take charge of any of up to 250 countries during the years between 1453 and 1789. Events play out day-by-day in realtime with leaders negotiating treaties, developing infrastructure, exploring new territories, founding colonies, competing for trade and making war with anyone who gets in their way.  There are no scripted objectives or victory conditions here. Your own success is determined by the goals you set for yourself. If you choose a major power like France or China, you might consider yourself successful if you can conquer your neighbors, establish trade in the Far East and set up profitable colonies in the New World. If you pick a smaller power like Bali or Transylvania, you'll need to set your standards for success a bit lower.   This third installment of Europa Universalis does make some attempt to lessen the more intimidating aspects of the game. The interface is much more polished this time around, both in terms of the main map and the window screens. The presentation of information is crucial in a game like this and Europa Universalis III does it better than any game in the series so far. Still, there's a lot you have to understand in order to play this game well and it's not always easy to see how the pieces fit together.  While the tutorial definitely hits the highlights, it still leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't, for instance, tell you that you have to move your ships out of port in order to load troops onto them. While it shows you how to utilize your colonists, it fails to point out just how and where you're supposed to send your merchants and missionaries. It's unrealistic to expect a tutorial for a game this dense to cover everything, there are certain important topics that you'll have to dig through the manual to find.  One of the coolest new features is the ability to choose any start date within the game's 346-year range. The developers claim that each starting date reflects the world situation at that moment. While we haven't bothered to check the status of the world year-by-year, we were happy to jump to certain events to see how things looked. Gamers who are so inclined can easily jump into Gustavus Adolphus' shoes at the start of the Thirty Year's War, or try to manage England's overseas possessions when her colonists first land in Virginia. Each of these events (and the others we checked) hit right when they're supposed to, giving players a wide choice of historically accurate starting positions.   In previous versions of the game, the AI rulers have tended to follow the course of history in terms of their decisions. England and France and Spain all fight for the New World, while a variety of states fight for dominance in Northern Europe. That's not the case with this third version of the game. We've had games where Venice becomes the dominant power in the Americas and Castile moves south to establish a powerful empire in Northern and Western Africa. While those two states have been focused overseas, Austria and Sweden managed to gobble up almost all of Northern Europe. History changes much more drastically (but no less realistically) this time around.  The range of historical events seems a bit less predictable this time around, particularly with respect to your rulers. Just because a nation suffered a succession crisis at a certain date is no guarantee that it'll happen at that point during your own game. Instead, these events are triggered by a variety of circumstances that arise out of your decisions.      The new concept of government types is just one of the ways that you can set yourself up for dramatic changes. Picking a government based on monarchy opens you up to all sorts of potential crises. We've had half of our entire empire split off after the death of a ruler. Then again, we've also had entire empires suddenly come over to us thanks to a royal marriage we brokered a few generations earlier. These types of events really make the game feel like real history.  National ideas are also a new feature that allow players to customize their nation in a variety of interesting ways. While the changes brought about by new governments are relatively obvious, it's the national ideas that really captured out attention. As you gain more levels of government technology, you'll be able to adopt new ideas that give you nation bonuses to technology, trade or agent generation. More significantly, some national ideas give you the opportunity to perform special actions, like exploring unknown territories.   European nations can jockey for positions within two large international organizations, the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire. By courting cardinals and electors, the player can make their nation favored and gain additional prestige or manpower. While it's an awesome added dimension to the game, one of the obvious problems with this system is that the game doesn't bother to tell you when you've lost control of the papacy or when one of your cardinals has been bribed away.  Europa Universalis III also introduces a new espionage component that really lets you tinker with other nations in a variety of underhanded ways. Whether you choose to slander or sabotage an enemy, you'll need to make sure that you're evaluating the risks and rewards correctly. It can be a lot cheaper than the traditional forms of diplomacy but, if you're caught, you'll give the targeted nation a justification for declaring war on you.  Where previous games focused on relatively generic units, this sequel opens up a world of specific unit types. Rather than simply fielding generic cavalry, infantry and cannons, you'll be able to recruit hussars and dragoons, redcoat and longbowmen, mortars and culverins. Each unit has specific strengths that you'll need to consider when deciding what troop types to field. Fortunately, the combat windows will show you all the bonuses that enter into a given combat, showing you at a glance whether or not you're suffering from poor terrain, bad river crossings, insufficient leadership or any of a number of other factors.   One of the smartest things the developers did this time around was to include an overall military support slider that governed how quickly your units are replenished. Where previous versions forced you to roll together the scraps of your former armies in order to maintain a concentrated force towards the middle and end of a campaign, this new military slider instead allows you to expend resources to keep your fighting forces in good shape.  Another interesting decision was to reward players who engage in warfare with the new concept of military tradition. Nations that engage in warfare will generate a military tradition that can be used to hire generals and admirals to lead their forces in the future. In this way, nations that don't practice war much won't be as good at it as nations that make a habit of it.      Europa Universalis III features much better graphics than have been seen in any of the series' previous titles. First and foremost, the main map takes up a much larger portion of the screen now, giving players the chance to really take in the whole strategic situation at a glance. There are a number of layers that you can use to view the map, showing off political status, trading areas, religious identities and so forth. Still, picking out the armies, fleets and whatnot isn't quite as easy as it should be in the close-up views.  There's definitely a lot more life to the game's visual presentation this time around. Where previous versions seemed like little more than boardgames, Europa Universalis III includes loads of animations and 3D elements that make the game a bit more exciting. Soldiers walk and fight on the main map, cranes get to work in the provinces when you're working on improvements and colonists start chopping down trees when you're trying to establish a new province. Small windows show off your cities, letting you see the specific buildings that you've constructed in the province.   The musical score is a fantastic addition that brings a bit of character and personality to the game. From the rollicking folk-style melodies to the atmospheric textures and strident military themes, the score really supports the game nicely and changes to suit the action as appropriate. It's not quite good enough to stand on its own apart from the game but it serves its purpose here quite well. The rest of the game's audio is less impressive with sound effects that are flat and generic.We've been big fans of this franchise since the original Europa Universalis came out years and years ago but we've always known that the game isn't for everyone. Though it will never have the mass appeal of games like Civilization it certainly fills a niche and feeds those gamers who are looking for a deep and involved historical strategy experience. With that in mind, Paradox has milked the franchise for years now, using it as the basis for a variety of other games that are little more than reskins of the original.This sequel finally shakes things up by exploring some new gameplay concepts and including some interesting new presentation elements. The new interface is definitely welcome and it gives the player access to a bit more information while also reducing the clutter of popups and notifications that seemed to accumulate in the other games. The new gameplay ideas aren't revolutionary but they manage to add more realism and a wider range of options to the basic historically-themed gameplay.It doesn't have the same impact that the original did so many years ago but the improvements definitely add a lot to the experience and make it more convenient for gamers who sometimes grew frustrated with the limitations of the earlier versions.", "date": "Jan 24, 2007"}
