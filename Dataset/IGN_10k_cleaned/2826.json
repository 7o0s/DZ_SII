Operation Flashpoint was the top of its genre. Not only did it stick in the position of a lowly foot soldier going throughout a war that was hard to understand (much like real life), but it also gave you the opportunity to participate in all facets of the conflict including covert night time operations, armor division maneuvers, helicopter missions, and airborne combat over water and land. There was a whole hell of a lot going into the game, and despite some shortcomings, it combined all of these elements with success. Now, around a year later, we're being welcomed back into this arena with Codemasters' official expansion pack for the game, Operation Flashpoint: Resistance. And for the most part, this add-on delivers on a lot of the same great gameplay features but manages not to fix some of the major problems that I had with the single player campaigns, and for some reason, I'm just not as patient in dealing with these problems this time around.   Resistance takes place several years before the original game and follows the story of Victor Troska. A man who's been in Special Forces for years fighting the Soviet Union here and there and who has, not surprisingly, become tired of the constant violence and killing. Following his heart, he retires to his home, an island called Nogovo to curl up beside the fire and read a trashy novel. We hear he likes Danielle Steele. What a sucker. Anyway, the island of Nogovo also happens to be a sovereign state. Until the Soviets show up and the government gives itself up when tanks blow up their houses and tread all over their nice rugs. Also not surprisingly, there are a lot of people not happy about having their democratic rights yanked from them and put in the hands of a socialist regime. That's when the fighting begins. And that's when Victor is drawn back into the life that he was so hoping to leave behind.   The story is told through some exceptionally long cutscenes that I was hoping to leave behind. I had this problem in the first game and I have this problem now. Whoever is putting these together has to learn some pacing. The cutscenes really bog down at times dwelling on shots of tanks rolling around for way too long. Hell, the opening story takes probably around half an hour to get through before you really start playing the game. They tried to break up the monotony by giving you control of Victor in the middle of some cutscenes. But I don't want to run around in a town where nothing is happening jsut to find a ride to work. And I especially don't want to wait for a damn bus to take me to into town. Just skip all that and get to the damn point. It really didn't help get me settled in character, which I'm guessing it was supposed to do. It just annoyed me. Especially when I restarted the game at home to play through the branching story line. Some of the cutscenes that are predetermined you can skip through, but there are some you can't, like the whole bus ride at the beginning. I had heard it all before and certainly didn't want to hear it again. I'm getting bored just thinking about it.   While I think they could have cut down on the length of most of these story points and found more interesting ways to include them in the game, they did manage to throw an interesting twist right at the beginning of the game that will give you different options. You have to make a choice as to whether to fight or to surrender to the will of the Russians. Depending on what you chose, you'll get some different missions. The roads converge eventually after Victor won't deal with the Soviets anymore, but you'll at least have some single player replay value to look forward to.   The story and the focus on the main character present a couple of big differences from the original game. Operation Flashpoint began by putting you in the shoes of a fresh out of bootcamp soldier under the command of friendly AI. Not this time. This time you're Victor. And Victor happens to be the only person on this island with any real combat experience leaving him in charge all of the time. So you'll have to take even more advantage of the troop control interface when you have units under your protection. The problem with this is that it's a fairly clunky and slow interface that just plain needs some help and has forever needed help. What should be an enjoyable and intense experience like you've seen in Medal of Honor and Halo, you get bogged down with some unresponsive and downright motarded soldiers under your command. There just isn't enough independent thought happening. Especially when they get in tanks.   The interface just isn't streamlined enough to deal with the fast reaction times you need to have in order to command units successfully. And when they decide they don't want to fire at enemies that are firing at you or them, even after you've given them the ~engage all~ and ~open fire~ and ~danger~ and ~please for the love of God attack those units before they kill me~ commands, it gets more than a little frustrating. When you outnumber the enemy but still end up losing because your group turns out to be a bunch of pacifists, it tends to result in the throwing of objects around the room and use of profanity like the world has never heard.    The other problem I always had, which also hasn't been attended to, was the major difficulty in finding and identifying enemies. Even when you're rolling along in a tank and you hear the ~tank spotted at 10 o'clock~, it's hard to find the enemy. You look towards 10 o'clock, but you can't see anything. And then you get shelled by the insanely accurate enemy tank that you can now just barely see. And before you know it, you're injured and your units haven't even fired off a shot yet.   Anyway, as a resistance leader and an experienced soldier, Victor realizes right off of the bat that waging a winning war against the invaders is an impossibility. But he also eventually realizes that that's no reason to lie down and take it up the bum. That whole Braveheart ~FREEEDOOM!!!~ thing. Basically, you're undermanned, underarmed, and really kind of an underwhelming force. Luckily Victor is some kind of tactical genius and suggests grabbing more ammunition and weapons. Otherwise the militia would have been throwing rocks at some nasty tanks that don't have as much patience as a charging rhino.   So you go off to steal weapons and ammunition with a few carefully calculated strikes at enemy convoys from your super secret forest base, conveniently located just off the I-90. Anyway, it's fun running these little missions where you have to get in, set up an ambush and get out with some firepower. You'll be able to keep most of the weapons you collect in these missions to arm your troops in later missions. In order to facilitate this gameplay element, you now have the option to drop weapons off, which you didn't before. Just remember to keep at least one weapon in your hands, it's embarrassing to get caught by the Soviets without one.   One of the really cool features in OpFlash was the ability to take vehicles and use them to your own gain. These included tanks, helicopters, planes, jeeps, you name it. The main problem here is that you have to have several units in some of these vehicles to operation them at a time. A tank requires a commander, a gunner, and a driver. You can take manual control over firing when you're in the driver position, which is good because trying to get a tank to go anywhere when you aren't in the driving position with the simple commands like forward, left, right, and backwards is so stupidly hard it borders on ridiculous. Tell a tank driver to go left/forward and you'll see the tank swivel to point the direction you want and then watch it swivel back and continue on the original course. You can always click on the ground where you want to move, but that's always a risky proposition as where you think you click isn't necessarily where you actually click.   If you were able to overcome most of the issues and battle through the frustration in the original, you'll probably be able to make it through Resistance with less problems. And you'll probably have a bunch of fun, because it really is a lot of the same gameplay strengthened with some new weapons and vehicles.    What did you think of Operation Flashpoint: Resistance? The multiplayer facet of OpFlash was always pretty fun as well. While it comes with deathmatch and capture the flag missions, the most entertaining of all of the missions to me were the cooperative levels. They're pretty well designed, if a bit difficult. The main issue here is that in order to really get all you can get out of the game, you'll need to have all of the player positions filled by human players. The AI is sketchy a lot of the time and of course, humans are able to think more on the fly with creative solutions than friendly AI is currently able to handle. But if you do get online and play together with a good group, you're in for a hell of a treat.   The look of Operation Flashpoint has been upgraded with the expansion. Well, it's been upgraded a little bit anyway. Trees and foliage certainly look better than the crap they used to look like, but the engine certainly can't hold a candle to the detail that many of the other first person shooters that are out there at the moment are capable of pumping out. You just have to remember the scale of the situation in Operation Flashpoint. You can see terrain for miles around. Given that scale, it's hard to argue so much. But I was really expecting more from the hullabaloo they were making about it.Sure, I said a lot of not so nice things about the game. I really wish they had been fixed. At the same time, Flashpoint still has a lot going for it even though the frustration. And Resistance offers enough new content to be deemed a worthy expansion pack. Those that had a lot of fun with OpFlash looking for a reason to get back into it will probably be pretty happy with what they find. Just don't expect any revolutionary changes to gameplay this time out.", "date": "Aug 1, 2002"}
