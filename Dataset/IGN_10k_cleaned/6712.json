Insaniquarium takes a look at life behind the glass, where you feed a colorful array of fish so they poop coins for you. The more coins these fish release, the more goodies you can buy for your tank, such as additional fish, better food, and egg pieces -- the latter being the overall objective of the game. Earn enough scratch to buy three egg pieces and you move on to the next stage.   Much like Glu's last big hit, Diner Dash, Insaniquarium is more of a balancing act than a traditional puzzle game. There is some resource management involved, as you try to grow the tank by filling it with fish and food, but you cannot speed too much too fast, or else you cannot sustain the cycle of life and death inside the tank. And there is plenty of death in Insaniquarium -- as fish grow tired and perish, carnivorous fish show up to feast on smaller guppies -- not to mention an eventual alien encounter (this is where the ~insanity~ apparently kicks in).   Insaniquarium lulls you with a leisurely first few levels, but pretty soon, things get frantic on the other side of the screen. You start out with a singular focus of feeding fish to earn coins, and then you're introduced to buying items, like better food. During this period, you get the hang of the basics, like moving a cursor around the screen to pick up falling coins. Pretty soon, you get a hungry snail that patrols the floor of the tank for any coins that aren't claimed before they hit the sand. Still, things feel pretty manageable here.   But when you start getting nasty fish in the tank, Glu turns out the heat. Trust me, the first few fish you lose are the hardest. Things get easier as you accept that fish will die during the game and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Soon, you fill the whole screen up with coin-farting guppies, and the screen fills up with coins. Fish die, but you have enough money to easily buy a new one and keep the coins coming in. And that's when the game loves to hit you with an alien attack. When the spaceman makes the scene, you have to scroll the cursor over him repeatedly to blast him back to his dimension.   Insaniquarium certainly has a lot to keep gamers coming back to it over and over. There are two game modes: Time Trial and Adventure. The goal of Time Trial is to pick up as much money as humanly possible before the lock runs out. The Adventure mode offers 15 levels of action, spread across three different tanks, so the scenery keeps changing. You can also unlock extra stuff, like pets which liven up the place.   Every tank is almost fiercely colorful in this well-made production. Insaniquarium's friendly fish are bright and happy-looking, while the mean Ultravores look incredibly evil. I'm not gonna gush about emotional attachment or anything in regards to Insaniquarium, but there is something to be said for making a bad guy truly look the part. The bad fish and the alien are in perfect contrast to the pleasant fish. Insaniquarium also has a pleasing theme and good effects.   Note: This review was originally written off of an ~almost~ final build of the game. I have played the final build available on decks now and the review stands as it is. Great game.  Insaniquarium is a great, great game. I had no exposure to it prior to playing the mobile edition, but checking out the PC game (which is anything but casual) only increased my appreciation of Glu's talents at translating successful casual games (Diner Dash, Zuma, etc.) to mobile. Insaniquarium is crazy fun and a good next download for mobile gamers that have managed to get their fill of Diner Dash.", "date": "Mar 10, 2006"}
