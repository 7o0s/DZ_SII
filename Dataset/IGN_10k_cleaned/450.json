I can't imagine a better way to annoy family members and generally detach myself from current American social society than by playing PC games when I should be, I dunno, talking or doing whatever it is people do to each other. I don't know if you'd call the familiar feeling of hitting alien-headed scientists nostalgia, but Opposing Force instantly brought back all the same shivers and shocks I got a year ago with the original game -- for good, and bad. It's good to be back.   The one thing that seemed a little odd about Half-Life was that a scientist could learn to throw grenades like a pro in the matter of an hour -- but I guess getting chased by spine-shattering aliens could do that to anyone. This time around you're in slightly more experienced hands. As Adrian Shepherd, you're the enemy -- part of the military team sent out to ~recover~ a certain wayward scientist named Gordon Freeman. Only you quickly find out that the bad guys aren't so bad after all. It seems that they were lied to as much as the scientists, and fairly early in the game, when your ass is left behind on the base while your fellow teammates leave for safer ground in a very cozy looking copter, you'll realize that the soldiers were as much of a pawn as anyone else. Conspiracy, anyone? I'll take two cubes of sugar with mine.    When you pop in any add-on pack, the first thing you look for, beyond new levels, is the ways you'll be doing some kill-kill-killing. One of your first new finds, and the best in my opinion, is the sited pistol that allows you to aim, and instantly kill most creatures. It fills that sniper-rifle feeling that makes my tummy warm, and solves the annoying problem of having to fire off 30 rounds of bullets to kill those hard to hit head crabs from afar. A new machine gun takes a nod from Team Fortress, and sprays an array of bullets that will quickly kill almost anything in your way, as long as you're willing to deal with its slow start speed. But forget about the human creations -- wait until you get your hand up into the butts of some of the new alien weapons. Kill a shock trooper (sort of like the electrified version of the grunt) and you'll get the scare of your life as it's weapon jumps right for your face, and attaches to your arm. The Shock Roach is the electrified replacement for the Hive Hand, and creates a nasty set of shocks for anyone in your way. The Spore Launcher is sort of like a squid version of a faithful puppy (you even pet it, and feed it spores by hand), that just happens to spit globs of explosive green ooze out of its slimy mouth. Last, and most bizarre, is the handy dandy ~Indiana Jones~ Barnacle, a scientific creation that allows you to attach a barnacle to your hand, and swing from nearby chunks of organic matter. Believe me, it's a lot better than having to swing from ropes and cables, one of the most tedious aspects of the game.   There aren't a lot of new creatures in Half-Life, which is understandable -- twenty new creatures in the same Black Mesa compound would convolute the plot. Instead, there's a few smart additions: another grunt-like trooper (the shock trooper), the next stage in the head crab evolution, and a scary set of super-fast spine-shooting beasts called pit drones. Add to that some big beasties, and you've got just enough new surprises to keep you entertained, and more importantly, fighting for your life. The sound takes the same cue as the creatures, keeping with the classics but adding a few new features. I loved the new music, but some of you will find it a little too techno-heavy for your tastes. That being said, anyone remember the odd times when pounding electronica would suddenly appear in Half-Life for no apparent reason? There's definitely more of a purpose with the sounds in OF, and you'll be hearing more music, more often. The sound effects are, for the most part, based on the original game, but the voices have a much crisper sound this time around, and the new creatures have voices, screams, and shouts that rival anything produced by the original set of baddies.  Though the game does an incredible job of connecting the plot of the two games, and even intertwining them at key moments (such as watching Freeman make his jump into the transporter device), it seems to focus on the aspects of Half-Life that most gamers would probably rather not relive in the original. Namely, jumping. Get ready for more jumping, and more box pushing in this game, as well as some frustrating rope swinging. The latter is the most awkward, and not only doesn't look right, but plays even worse. The last few scenes of Half Life featured some insane jumps and annoying catwalking, and OF raises that level even higher. On the up side, OF features new team battles, which take advantage of your soldier status by pairing you up with groups of two, three and more men during certain segments of the game. Though I had some problems with them at times (namely one soldier doing watch for me in a doorway, only to shoot me when I came by later to grab him), for the most part it adds a great sense of team style gameplay, especially when you're battling some of the badder baddies like the assasins. Better yet, there are certain areas where you lose if your companion dies, which means that not only do you have to worry about saving your ass, but some stranger's butt-type region as well.  The multiplayer game throws you some new maps, as well as the new weapons featured in the game, but doesn't really fix or tweak anything related to the original mplayer experience -- meaning that if you enjoyed Half-Life online, this will bring new life to your online experience, but if you're craving the super smooth action of Quake III Arena, you'll still be disappointed.  In the end the repetition of the original game's theme, which gives you jolts of excitement early in the game, is exactly why it ends up being short of the original. Without the sheer horror and wonder of travelling into new territories with no idea what's around the corner, OF takes away the key piece of Half-Life's puzzle: surprise. With the exception of a few films, most sequels have problems recreating the experiences that made the original so popular in the first place, and games are no different. Though it would be hard for me to imagine any fan of the original not having a great time with OF, I certainly don't think that it's in any way comparable to the original -- but then again, what add-on pack is?  Half Life was my favorite PC game of the year, and OF does a fantastic job of making you remember exactly why you enjoyed the original so much. But that's unfortunately also its biggest drawback. You'll experience a lot of the same features and frights that you did in the original, and while it was a stomach-churning experience in the first game, it feels like familiar territory in the second. That's not to say that there aren't a hefty share of scares in OF -- just that, for most of the game, you'll know exactly what you're up against. The ninjas, the army battles, the head crabs crawling around in air ducts... it's all back, in the now-classic Half-Life style. As an add-on pack, it's well worth the price of admission, but as a full priced game (it's selling at retail for around $40), you may find yourself wishing for a more original experience. Me? I was just happy to spray some spores over innocent Houndeyes. But does any of this even matter? Half-Life junkies, you know why you'll buy this game, despite some red-headed freak telling you that maybe you might kinda maybe want to think about the purchase. Believe me, I'd do the same thing. Opposing Forces may not be the next step up in the Half-Life saga, but it's certainly travelling down the same gore-strewn corridors.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Nov 25, 1999"}
