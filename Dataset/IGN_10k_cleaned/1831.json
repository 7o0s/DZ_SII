What it is, is a music sequencer that enables you to make music with your Game Boy. If you're looking for something akin to MTV Music Generator for the PlayStation, stop reading now, because Nanoloop will only disappoint. However, if you're into low-tech videogame music or want something completely unique to plug into your Game Boy, Nanoloop could be just the scratch to your itch. Features  Three types of sounds Make music patterns and save them into songs Battery backed Link cable support for dual system generation For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Nanoloop was originally a school project for German Oliver Wittchow, but the end result worked so well he decided to manufacture the software into a custom cartridge and sell it on his website. It's been a hit with fans of videogame music and interesting technology, as well as with electronic musicians looking for that extra something to add to their songs. I fall into the latter category, but realize that many non-musicians may also enjoy it.  While the Nanoloop doesn't play sampled sounds, it does take amazing advantage of the Game Boy's sound chips, breaking them down into three basic sound types: Sound-Synthesis, Rectangular Wave, and Noise. Sound-Synthesis gives you a basic tone, ad does the Rectangular Wave, and the Noise is just that -- adjustable noise that can be used to make approximations of things like snares and explosions.  The Nanoloop has what we call a 16-step sequencer. Instead of composing notes on a staff, as you would a regular music piece, the Nanoloop offers you 16 steps with which to compose. Each step can have either a note or a rest, and is represented by a gray square on the screen, organized in four rows of four. By maneuvering a cursor across this sequencer matrix, notes can be assigned and changed.  Each of the sound types is assigned to the matrix separately, and runs in tandem with the others. So you could first make a pattern of Sound-Synthesis, then Rectangular Waves, and finally Noise, conceivably having three patterns of 16 notes each all playing at the same time. Each note can be adjusted so the sound is greatly affected. A steady tone could be modulated to sound like a buzz, or a thump. Patterns can be saved and called back up easily, and organized into songs. One of the neatest features of the Nanoloop is that sound type patterns can be played in any combination, not just with the original other two.  Of course, all of the sound generated is fairly primitive, so don't expect to be making the kind of music you hear on the radio. It's more like the kind of music you'd hear in a NES game. If this is the kind of thing you're into, it's great fun. It's like composing music for games that don't exist.  Being a primitive 16-step sequencer, the Nanoloop never stops. It just keeps playing and playing and playing. You can adjust the tempo, but you can't stop it. While seemingly annoying at first, this eventually becomes part of its charm. It also makes it extremely addicting -- you'll be surprised how much time can pass when you get sucked into it.  Here's a selection of MP3s that I made with a Nanoloop.

In fact, it's probably only for a very few select Game Boy owners. However, it is one of the more unique items available for the Game Boy, and if you're at all musically inclined, I can't recommend it more highly.  --Adam Douglas  Nanoloop can be ordered at www.nanoloop.com.
