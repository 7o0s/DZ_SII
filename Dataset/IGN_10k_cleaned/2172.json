The Santa Monica Studios-developed title is a futuristic racing game where the characters are pretty much wearing the vehicles more than driving them, as they are fused into these kinetic suits with wheels on their hands and feet.   Gameplay In these suits, the racers can do a lot of different things beyond just accelerate and brake. Various tricks can be performed whether on the ground or in the air to increase the boost meter, which gives them the ability to perform speed bursts, tight turns can be executed by grabbing onto the road, and power-ups, which include things like faster speed bursts, weapon attacks, and drafting, can be used once enough of the power-up items are collected.   The key thing to remember here is that all of these different facets of the game are really important in determining whether or not you'll be able to consistently win each of the races. If you don't do enough tricks and combos to fill up your boost meter, you're going to have a tough time finishing in first place because the CPU opponents will be doing tricks, getting extra boosts and leaving you in the dust. And the same can be said for the collecting of the power-up items to get the extra bursts, weapons, and specials like drafting.   Moreover, each of the tracks are filled with plenty of alternate routes and shortcuts, and it's going to be up to you to learn which is the best one to take, as it's not always obvious. And taking shortcuts isn't something to just think about casually as you can in most games of this kind, as missing an important one can send you from first to last if the CPU racers take a good one and you don't. The bottom line is that you're going to really have to master all of these different aspects of the game to get to the point where you can consistently finish at the front of the pack.  This could be looked as one of the game's problems -- it has a fairly steep learning curve. The speed of the racing is insanely fast and because of this it's pretty hard to keep from grinding on the walls when you're trying to do a lot of tricks and before you begin to take advantage of some of the more advanced turning techniques where you slide into turns and power out of them. The races can be pretty frantic and will often feel completely out of control. You might find yourself slamming into walls like crazy, falling off the track, and completely out of control, yet still in first place because you happened to get a nice power-up or did a good job of filling up your boost meter completely. At the same time, you can be in first and running the perfect race and then make a little mistake where you fall off the track or get stuck in some corner on the track and find yourself in dead last.   These problems are even more apparent when racing against another human in the game's two-player split-screen mode. The track designs are highly original and feature an insane amount of crazy twists, turns, up and downs, and while this makes for some intense racing in single player, it can get somewhat frustrating when playing with half the screen in two-player mode. Parts of the track that are easy to fall off of in single player mode become a major problem when racing with another player. The racing is simply too fast for its own good and the crazy track design becomes more of a problem than an asset. Still, the game offers up a highly enjoyable single player racing experience as long as you can deal with the steep learning curve and sense of uncontrolled mayhem.   Graphics The game's visuals are pretty tight for the most part. The city-like futuristic environments are filled with lots of transparent surfaces and crazy lighting effects, and look pretty damn impressive. Things aren't quite as nice with the environments that are based in lusher, more organic locales, as you'll notice more flickering and jaggies on these tracks, but the overall look of the game is definitely above average. The only major complaint that one will likely have is that the framerate can get really choppy at times, especially when all of the racers are bunched up together at the start of each race and whenever a lot of collisions are happening on screen. It's not a huge problem, but a fault nonetheless.  Sound Unique is definitely a hot word in this review and it's going to be used once again to describe the game's sound. The soundtrack is comprised of a lot of very uniquely sounding techno-ish beats that is completely befitting of the game's futuristic mood. It doesn't always quite fit the speed or pace of the game, but it's nice to listen to, especially if you dig the kind of music that was used in the movie, The Fifth Element. Kinetica offers a really unique racing experience that offers up high-speeds that are comparable to what you'd get in the Wipeout games, plus a nice blend of trick performing and racing that was presented in EA's SSX. It's a very fast and fun racing game, as well as a very challenging one. The only possible turnoff is that it might just be a little too hectic for its own good and even after you've learned to master the tricks, tracks and power-ups, it's all too easy to make a very minor mistake that sends you from first to dead last, whether it be falling off the track after a big jump or getting stuck in a small corner that you have to reset to get out of. In spite of these problems, Kinetica remains a fun, and unique racing experience that's definitely worth playing.", "date": "Oct 16, 2001"}
