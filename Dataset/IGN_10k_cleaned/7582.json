Whether the waves are being made over sex, drugs or violence, it seems that there's always something on which legislators, lawyers and parent groups can hang their scorn. Games that promote lifestyles and behaviors that would be intolerable in the real world routinely come under attack for the influence they are believed to have on gamers.  Left Behind: Eternal Forces seemed like the perfect antidote to that. Nevertheless, this Christian-themed game, based on the popular book series about mankind's final days against the Antichrist, has inspired its own controversies. Some rejected the seeming intolerance inherent in the game's emphasis on converting non-believers. Some objected to what they perceived to be the game's exploitation of Christian theology. Misinformed or not, the controversy has definitely helped raise the visibility of this game and bring it to audiences it might never have reached otherwise.   In brief, the game follows the basic premise of the book. One day, all the true Christians vanished from the world. Though the authorities left on the Earth tried to explain this away as some freakish magnetic pulse, a small group of people suddenly realized that the Christians had been raptured up to Heaven. These new believers, those left behind, now find themselves fighting against the forces of the Antichrist who is building his world government on the bones on the United Nations.  The game lets players take charge of the new believers in the struggle in a standard real-time strategy format. New York City is your battleground and missionaries are your soldiers. You'll be fighting against the forces of the Antichrist -- secular recruiters, rock stars and cultists. Who comes out on top will depend on how well you use the resources at your disposal.  At the most basic level, the game is about using your disciple units to recruit more believers. These believers can then be sent to a variety of structures for training in other essential roles: they can become disciples themselves and go out to recruit more believers; they can become builders to buy and refit old buildings; they can become musicians to shift the allegiance of evil units to neutral; they can become soldiers or doctors to help on the frontlines when things get bloody. There are various tiers and upgrades to be found among each of the classes but the basic functions are still the same.  Although the buildings you own provide important resources like housing, food and cash, everything in the game revolves around the resource of spirit. Each unit has their own spirit ranking. You can increase it by praying or decrease it by killing other units. Raise the spirit of a neutral and he or she will join the good guys. Lower it and they'll take their part with the forces of evil.   The early missions focus on walking around and recruiting new units. As you gain more experience with the interface, you'll start to build your own infrastructure by taking over buildings in the city. You'll also come into conflict with the bad guys of the game, the Global Community Peacekeepers. Since they don't have to worry about their spirit rating dropping too low, they're not penalized for killing your units.  To keep the balance of power in your favor, you'll have to find non-violent ways to avoid getting killed. Your units will definitely fight back in a life or death situation but, for the most part, you want to either avoid your enemies or have a ready plan to convert to your side using musicians and disciples. This gets much harder as the game progresses.  There are some small problems with the overall interface. For one thing, your disciples seem to have a hard time selecting neutrals to convert. We frequently (and we mean frequently) had to click around and around just to get our disciples on task. Eventually, you'll stumble on the idea of setting your units to automatically use their powers but even this causes problems. The units just aren't smart enough to take any initiative here so you'll spend the majority of your time micromanaging the particulars rather than planning out your overall strategy.      Pathfinding is excellent when you're just moving down the street. Your units will occasionally walk right into a moving car but they always bounce right back and continue on their merry way. The problem arises when you give a unit an order and their path is blocked by something as simple as a lightpost or a mailbox or another unit. They sometimes simply can't find their way around these obstacles so you'll have to waste even more time leading them around by the hand. I've had units literally not be able to find their way across the street.  There are also some faults in the mission scripting. Nearly every mission requires you to build a bank before you do anything else but none of the missions actually tell you this. Instead, you'll be told via in-game dialogue and your objectives screen that you need to build a chapel right away. Once you build it, a window pops up telling you how stupid you were for not building a bank first and then asks you if you want to restart. Uh, excuse me?   Many missions also end if portions of your characters lose their faith and become neutral or evil. Where it might lead to some interesting back and forth action, it instead results in immediate mission failure. It certainly doesn't say much about the persistence of those who are left behind if they're willing to throw in the towel just because the enemy seduced away one of their believers.  Persistence will pay off for you, however, as you make your way through the missions. Succeed and you'll be rewarded not only with forward progress but with some interesting articles about God, the Bible and your place in the universe. The short articles are intended to stimulate thought and discussion about spiritual matters. The ones that place the argument in a historical or scientific framework are remarkably enlightening and compelling. Those that lean a bit more towards matters of opinion aren't quite as interesting or thought provoking.  In any case, the controversy about the game's message has been overinflated somewhat. Given the wide range of games that are inspired by religious, mythical and supernatural beliefs, it's interesting to see a game that presents the concepts of a modern religion like Christianity as core components of gameplay. True, the very idea that converting non-believers is the central activity in the game is likely to alienate some people but it really shouldn't be much of a surprise to people that a game with a picture of an angel and a warning about the antichrist on the box is going to have a Christian slant.   Still, even those gamers who appreciate the game's message will notice some uncomfortable inconsistencies. The game takes a firm stand about the righteous subject matter and gameplay and then lets the player turn around and play as the antichrist in multiplayer. While the variety is nice (or would be if there was anyone actually playing online), it tends to undercut the morality of the game's overall message. You can even add to that the mild traces of sexism arising from the gender qualifications for jobs -- ~Sorry, Sally. We'd love to convert you, but we only have room for one more believer and we all know girls can't build houses.~  The graphics are poor. Buildings are composed of simple polygon boxes with little ornamentation or style. You'll get the odd awning here and there, but for the most part, the buildings are flat and featureless. The textures are equally flat, even on the highest detail settings. The intricate designs on the front of a chapel are rendered with no more depth than you'd see on a cardboard cutout. Frequent repetition and flipping of tiles doesn't give the game much variety.  The only textures that look good are the high number of billboards and advertisements scattered throughout the city. While some gamers might be offended by the presence of these ads, they actually serve to make the game world feel a bit more real. Steam rises from grates in the streets, and adds to the overall realism of the environment. Buildings cast shadows on one another as well, which can reinforce the sense of scale here.       The character and vehicle models are a bit better but only because you don't get as close to them as you do to the buildings. Animations are reasonably convincing for the people, but the cars are laughable. They can only move forward in eight directions, so they're a blast to watch as they turn through intersections. Even more ridiculous, some vehicles will just spin all the way through the intersections.  Special effects on each character when using an ability are bright and effective. It would be nice, of course, if the different character types had a little more unique look. It's not always easy to tell which of the brown-haired guys in white shirts and vests are your believers and which ones are your musicians, for instance.   Left Behind's camera works reasonably well in light of the tremendous height of some of the buildings. The zoom and rotate function of the camera lets you see the action from just about any angle you want, and the buildings (almost always) fade to nothingness as the action moves behind them. We ran into a few instances where the camera just didn't want to cooperate. Backing up against the map edge usually leaves a sizable area beneath you that you can't see.   A wide range of voice actors have lent their talents to Left Behind's story but the quality leaves a bit to be desired. Awkward accents (the spunky New Yorker who wants to spread the ~troot~ is a nice touch) and a handful of unnatural readings definitely distract players from the action on the screen. The musical score is subtle but effective, lending an atmosphere to the game that always sits just outside of your awareness.  There are a lot of Christian rock acts featured in the clue screens between missions. While it's not everyone's cup of tea, the selections here are enjoyable and typical of the genre. The style of music, however, serve as an unintentionally amusing commentary on the game's decision to cast electric guitarists as the minions of evil on the Antichrist's side.   Finally, there are some basic functionality issues that continue to frustrate us. The game has crashed several times during loading screens. Given the interface frustrations that threaten the success of your mission, you're likely to be reloading the game a lot. Which means, at least in our experience, that you'll be doing a complete reboot just to get the game up and running again. We've also experienced a corrupted save file that, when we tried to load it, prompted the game to tell us that had a ~lost connection.~Ultimately, our opinion of this game is based less on the message it contains than the way it looks and plays. The basic design of the game is intriguing and worthy of a better treatment than it gets here. Fighting for and keeping recruits requires some thoughtful and persistent strategies and the fact that you have to do it without shooting or stabbing your enemies adds even more depth. Unfortunately, the inconsistent behavior of your recruits means you'll spend more time fighting the interface than the Antichrist.", "date": "Nov 14, 2006"}
