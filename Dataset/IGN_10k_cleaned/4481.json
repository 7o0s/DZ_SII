Features:  52-card counting game Head-to-head tournaments Progressive tournaments Practice Mode  The goal is to get 21 -- any way possible. Whether that's through a natural blackjack or a Five-Card Freddy. (Five cards add up to 21 -- not an easy feat.) The clock is ticking, pardner. How many times can you score 21 out of a 52-card deck?  You have four rows of cards in play. Try to clear each line of cards by creating combos of 21. Each regular combo is worth 5,000. A Blackjack Wild (jack of spades or jack of clubs) is worth 7,5000. The biggest combo is a Five-Card Freddy, worth 10,000 points.  The game goes by fast. Sure, there's always a clock ticking, but you will find that, as you practice, you can get really good at quickly busting out 21-point combos. And the faster to finish the deck, the more bonus points you receive at the end of the game.  Be careful about hording low cards to make Five-Card Freddies. Sure, they're worth a lot of points, but the game is timed -- and you may get a higher score by busting out fast combos and earned more bonus points.  The game is deliriously simple, which keeps you coming back for more. The set-up is crisp and clear, making it easy to keep track of the cards at all times.Prize-21 For Prizes! is one of the more entertaining games in Atlas Mobile's tournament service.
