This action puzzler apes the core of Taito's wildly successful Bust-A-Move series, but adds a boatload of new goals and collectibles that will make it more appealing to the crowd of casual gamers spoiled by the newest generation of content-packed web and download games from titans like PopCap and Big Fish.   Gameloft's tropical theme bursts with color and detail, serving to obscure the simple fact that the game wholesale lifts the entire premise of Bust-a-Move. There are even two islanders, Kale and Malia, controlling the ball cannon at the bottom of the screen, replacing the dino buddies from Taito's hit. As you clear screens, you move around a lush island map, filling the backdrop with bright scenery. The music is another high point of production -- Gameloft has excelled over and over at pumping music into its iPod games that is so good you will be tempted to turn your own library off in favor of it.   Bubble Bash offers some additional stage goal beyond just clearing the screen. There are boss battles at the end of each section of the island where you must clear small ball groupings to launch balloons at the top-of-the-screen monster. Another goal floats balls and balloons across the screen and tasks you will eliminating a certain number of groups. You are awarded points based on your time for clearing the screens, which in turn awards trophies at between-stage stat screens.   Understanding that the new rule of casual is dispensing a steady stream of rewards to keep the player hooked, Gameloft fills the game with collectibles. Items fill a gallery. New outfits for the heroes (and a crab assistant) drop into view. Story scenes and map pieces drip-drip-drip new stuff for the player to seek out. This stuff has zero effect on the actual gameplay, but it's the kind of thing players now expect from a casual experience.   Bubble Bash offers 100 screens in its story mode. That sounds like quite a bit of value, but there is a degree of repetition that sets in somewhere around screen 40. Even the boss monsters start to essentially repeat themselves, with little swaps here and there to at least the general appearance. I must confess that while I do like the game, my interest did wane from time to time. This is not something I played in marathon sessions. Bubble Bash worked far better in bite-sized portions. But should the 100 screens not be enough for your $5, there are extra stages to unlock and an endless play mode that tests your bubble-bashing stamina.  Bubble Bash for the iPod ranks as one of the better games for Apple's media player, but the derivative nature of the game puts it behind Gameloft's other efforts, such as Naval Battle and Brain Challenge. If you like the Bust-a-Move experience, Bubble Bash is your only option on the iPod right now and that alone will likely warrant a purchase. However, I just can get around the fact that I grew listless with Bubble Bash in a way that I did not with the aforementioned games. And that's why I am hesitant to give it a huge recommendation.", "date": "Mar 25, 2008"}
