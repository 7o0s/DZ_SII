With the release of Bass Rise, Bandai has become the latest of a long list of publishers that includes the likes of Agetec and Natsume to drop line looking to hook fishing gamers.  Gameplay Bass Rise offers the players a wide-array of lure's to use and a nice assortment of locale's in which to fish in. The game initially starts off with only two fishing spots opened to the player, but more can be opened simply by fishing a few times at each of the two initial spots. Even more can be opened if the player manages to be successful at accomplishing various challenges that are put unto the player.   The way the game is setup it has a sort of RPG-ish feel. There's no level building or anything like that, but the game has an RPG-like progression where more things are opened up as you complete certain tasks. Players are presented with the option of choosing either a male or female character to use, although it doesn't appear as though the characters offer any different abilities or skills. When progressing through the game, players will be introduced to other characters that will give fishing advice and will give the player tasks that need to be completed.   Bass Rise works with either the regular Sony control pad, the dual shock controller, or one of the various fishing controllers that are currently on the market. The game is playable with the digital pad, but the play value greatly increases if one uses the dual shock controller, as it gives the player a greater amount of control. Nevertheless, if you're looking to get the most enjoyment out of this or any other fishing game, playing it with a fishing controller is a must.   The play mechanics are pretty simple. The player selects the type of lure and then decides on the spot in the water to cast. When the lure is in the water, the player can reel it in at different speeds and give it tugs at several different angles. Depending on which lure us used, how the player tugs and pulls in the lure will greatly affect the success of catching a fish. It's all about finesse, making the lure attract the fish.   Bass Rise uses an underwater camera perspective that is rather impressive in the visual sense, but ends up detracting a bit from the gameplay. One of the best facets about fishing is the mystery of not knowing what you're reeling in. This mystery is not a part of Bass Rise as the player can see what's been hooked.   Another negative aspect with the game is the apparent lack of control that one has with actually hooking the fish. When the player gets a bite, the fish is either hooked or not hooked, and players don't have control over which they'll get. If a fish is hooked, the announcer will yell ~Fish On~ and if not, the fish will get loose regardless of what the player does. One should be able to hook the fish by pulling back on the rod (or pressing the corresponding button on the controller), but that doesn't seem to work in this game.  Graphics The developers decided to use the PlayStation's high-resolution mode in creating Bass Rise. In doing this, they've succeeded in producing one of the most visually appealing fishing games on the system. The backgrounds are almost photo-realistic and the water visuals are a site to behold.   However, in going with the high-resolution graphics, some sacrifices had to be made to the game. Most notably, the game has some slowdown problems that seem out of place in a game of this sort. There's also a great deal of clipping, pop up and other graphical glitches.   Sound Bass Rise has some of the finest sounding water effects of any game on the market. The ambient background noises combined with the sound of the water do an astounding job of putting the player into a convincing fishing atmosphere. If you're under a lot of stress, it might be a good idea to plop this game into your PlayStation and just leave it at the title screen. Even though it's not a genre that I'd list as one of my favorites, I've played my share of fishing games over the course of my gaming life. Fishing games generally have a sort of primitive quality that makes them very easy to get in to and at times extremely addictive. When playing Bass Rise in preparation for this review, there were numerous moments where I found it hard to put down the fishing controller. Fishing has some sort of weird addictive quality to it, whether in a videogame or in the real world, and this holds true to form in Bass Rise. While one doesn't quite get the same stress-relieving effect when playing this game that one would get when fishing in real life, both are rewarding on a primal level. Whilst games of this sort can be entertaining, most seem to suffer from a lack of long-term play value. Bandai's Bass Rise fits with this typecast. It's definitely not a game for everyone and even for those of you that enjoy fishing games, there are better ones than Bass Rise currently available for the PlayStation. Fishing fans may want to give this game a rental, but for those not interested in this genre, this definitely won't win you over.", "date": "Dec 16, 1999"}
