How does it manage to accomplish such a feat on its first trip to the plate? Read on.   Features:   Console-esque pitching menu  Automatic fielding  Voice and sound effects  First game in CBS Sportsline line-up   Mforma is hardly a newcomer to the wireless gaming landscape, but its first attempt at a sports game -- already a crowded genre -- is a homerun. True, it's missing a couple minor touches, such as only having four teams and some oddly absent MLB license issues -- but it has it where it counts: gameplay.   CBS Sportsline Baseball reminds us of a console game, particularly when its your turn to pitch. On the mound, you use the touchpad to select a pitch, then have access to a tiny cursor to direct the course of the ball. And every pitcher has a different selection of pitches, depending on their real-life specialties. Batting is also very easy to pick up. Once you place your batter in the box, use the action key to swing the lumber.   Fielding is on auto-pilot. While this may make purists throw up their mitts and groan, understand how tough it is already to manage an entire field -- pitching, hitting, base running, stealing -- without piling fielding on top of that. And besides, when the computer manages a pop fly and its base runners start tearing up the diamond, aren't you gonna be glad the auto-fielding has your back?   CBS Sportsline Baseball looks great. The players are nicely detailed and decent-sized. The animation is somewhat limited, however. More impressive, though, are the sound effects. When you score a homer, you hear the classic ballpark organ music. The crack of the bat is appropriately sampled, but the umpire's voice samples are what will really blow your hair back. Voice in a mobile game? Hopefully, more developers will try to squeeze this in.CBS Sportsline Baseball is an excellent way for Mforma to leave the dugout and storm the field. The mobile baseball category is woefully thin -- some earlier attempts, like SEGA Mobile's Home Run King were terrible. While we would have liked to have seen more teams, if we were able to accept it in Tecmo Bowl, we can accept it in CBS Sportsline Baseball. Nice play, Mforma.", "date": "Apr 24, 2004"}
