From the very beginning we've been following D3's Dragon Blade: Wrath of Fire, as the game may not be a high-budget, AAA title, but it dares to try something original on the system rather than just copping out and attaching a half-assed license onto an otherwise original IP.  Dragon Blade may not be your kind of game, and it may not be the most polished effort on Wii, but it's a breath of fresh air nonetheless; it just could have used more time in development, or a bit more ambitious design.   Dragon Blade makes no excuses for what it is: A pure-blooded action game.  Players move from level to level with Wii-mote and nunchuk in hand, and attack hordes of enemies en mass.  Run into an open area and you're bound to be surrounded by a field of darkness, allowing more baddies to spawn and attack.  Kill them all, and you're free to move on.  No puzzles, no platforming, just pure action.    That being said, Dragon Blade is also a first-time effort on Wii, and with it come a few issues within the game's design.  Developer Land Ho attempted to create a seamless, ~one-to-one~ fighting system which allows players to act out the sword swipes, and in turn see them delivered in kind on-screen.  The game takes into account horizontal, vertical, and stabbing motions, adding more in as the game progresses.  You'll begin with only the Dragon Blade, and then upgrade its powers as you go, adding a whip for the tail, giant dragon hands for huge attacks, and a head for fireball shooting and massive kill-all like attacks.  A simple press of the d-pad calls the next magical form of the sword, and in turn enables more ass-kicking.   Even with the multiple moves, however, the game is shallow.  Each level has players running from point A to point B, beating up everything in their path with Wii gestures.  Levels can be a bit too long and sparse, however, as you'll run through gigantic areas only to approach enemies waiting idle on the near-edge of the draw distance.  In closed in areas, a sketchy camera will often turn or pan frantically to keep up with the action, often bunching up like similar action games of its kind (the original version of Ninja Gaiden on Xbox comes to mind).   As for the actual combat, there's some fun to be had, but only if players fully understand what they're getting.  This isn't God of Wii, nor is it a fully-realized design like the aforementioned Ninja Gaiden.  Dragon Blade is a budget experience, it plays as such, and sits at a cheaper $40 price point.  Personally we'd go even lower, but $40 seems to be the new budget point; still a bit on the expensive side.     There's a ton of waggle to be had, but players that get a bit more ambitious with their swings will have more success in its motion-tracking.  There are a few basic strategies, such as the ability to lock-on, counter-attack, or pull off dragon-specific attacks for the tail, head, and arms, but it'll eventually result in the Wii-equivalent of button-mashing, as you'll still notice some odd motion tracking as you try to pull off timed, motion-specific combos.    The game has its high points, it's just surrounded by sluggish AI and shallow gameplay  that can come from a quicker development cycle.  Even the boss battles, which are easily the most entertaining aspect of the game, still deal with some wonky AI issues, as the dragons will go from attacking at seemingly-random intervals to perfectly tracking your player's movements in a moment's notice.  Battles are difficult and intense though, so hardcore gamers that are forgiving on the gameplay deficiencies will still find enough entertainment to justify at least a rental; it's just too thin overall for much more.  On the audio/visual side of things, the game has some of the most basic visuals we've seen on Wii at some points, and then teams it with impressive fire effects and some seriously over-the-top battle animations.  As a total package, however, players will want more, and hopefully a Dragon Blade sequel will deliver on all aspects.  We dig the Dragon Blade concept, and it's one of the reasons we've been following the game so close since its first showing during pre-E3 showings.  Wii needs more games like Dragon Blade, not only on the ~original IP~ train of thought, but as far as beat-em-ups go.  The game simply suffers from what looks like a fast development time, not a ton of experience with the hardware yet, and a full retail pricing.  As a $40 game (still better than $50) Dragon Blade lacks in far too many areas to be worth the cash, as the combat is simple, the design is entirely one-dimensional, and the simplistic enemy AI and gameplay bugs get in the way of an otherwise straightforward design.  For fans of beat-em-up games, or for those that just want to try something new on Wii, give this one a rental, or wait until it drops a bit more before purchasing.  Everyone else is free to join us on the wait for a more polished, focused, and ambitious effort in a sequel.  The concept is there, but the execution isn't.", "date": "Oct 3, 2007"}
