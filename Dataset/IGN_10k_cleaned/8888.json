So many Sudoku games at this point that the DS library is starting to look like the shelves of an outlet bookstore. Not to miss out on the craze, Ubisoft put its Gameloft mobile development team on a Sudoku design on the Nintendo DS. Outside of the Brain Age Sudoku engine, this one's probably the top of the heap of Sudoku games on the Nintendo DS. It's got a solid execution with a design that gives players a sense of accomplishment through unlocking extras by solving puzzles, and the addition of Kakuro is a nice inclusion to spice up the usual Sudoku offering.   In Sudoku, you've got a nine by nine grid of numbers, one through nine. The idea is to use the hints given and fill in those numbers so that all nine numbers span each row, column and grouping without a single number repeating. It's simple, addictive, and it's taking over newspapers and bookshelves all over the world.   At the start of Platinum Sudoku, you're offered your choice of a male or female character that'll be your guide during the game's Sudoku outing.  That's one of the many customization options that are available to you during the game's presentation - the rest are unlockable as you solve the puzzles. At the very least, Platinum Sudoku gives players a real feeling of accomplishment with all the things you can unlock, even if they're nothing more than a different font or background.   Like the Brain Age Sudoku game, Platinum Sudoku enables handwriting recognition so players can fill in their answers (or jot in a note). If that's too slow and untrustworthy for your tastes, you can simply tap in your selection via the number pad on the left or right side depending on your selected handedness. Like Telegames' Ultimate Puzzle Games: Sudoku Edition, Ubisoft's game has a puzzle builder as well as a puzzle solver. It also has a rendition of Kakuro, a slight variation of the Sudoku idea, which definitely is a nice change of pace from the familiar number grid. What it doesn't have is unfortunate: yes, there's multiplayer, but you need a second copy of the game. No game sharing.Platinum Sudoku has a cool and clean presentation which gives it a slight edge over the tons of third party Sudoku games already on the market for the Nintendo DS. It's still not the best of the best (that goes to Nintendo's Brain Age ~extra~) but for a standalone product, second best isn't a bad place to be. Just bring that price down to 20 bucks, Ubisoft - 30 bucks is just a little too much to ask for Sudokuespecially with other, cheaper versions already on the market.", "date": "Aug 14, 2007"}
