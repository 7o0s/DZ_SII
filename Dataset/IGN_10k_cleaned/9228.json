As one of six hard-bodies racers, you must suit up and zoom your jet ski through almost two dozen courses set around the world, from Brazil to Alaska.   One of Gameloft's biggest aims is to replicate as much of the jet ski experience as possible on mobile, and admittedly, they've done a remarkable job. Bouncing across the chop, you must raise the nose of your craft so you don't bob too far underwater as lose time. Steering through glassy sections is pretty loose, but when the water gets nasty, you really must watch your moves lest you tip over. Correcting your craft before tumbling must be mastered if you want to succeed in the game's championship races.   After checking out the general feel of the game in a small tutorial, head into the career mode to really explore Turbo Jet Ski 3D. At the start of the game, you only have two racers and two craft to choose from, but as you win events, you earn money and unlock additional content.   Each location has several events, from basic races where you must weave around floating flags, to trick challenges where you must pull off big tricks to earn photo points. I like the variety of things to do in the game, especially to race to save drowning people out in the chop. Having more than just simple races keeps the game from getting as stagnant as still water.   Out on the water, you must use those flags and land tricks to earn the titular turbo and boost through tough sections of the track or nose ahead of a rival just as the finish line comes into view. None of the races are particularly long, which is perfect for mobile. In just five minutes, you've buzzed around a slalom course, burned off a few tricks, and hopefully earned enough to unlock another racer.   As always, Gameloft loves to sex up their games. Turbo Jet Ski 3D stars a cast of beach bodies, from hot mamas in bikinis to ripped thoroughbreds that will want to do body shots after the big race. The visual wow extends to the courses themselves. Gameloft does a great job recreating authentic touches, such as the canals of Venice to erecting the statue of Christ the Redeemer in the backdrop of the Rio de Janeiro course. And, as expected, there's a wonderful use of color through the entire game.  Turbo Jet Ski 3D is a blast. The smart, attractive courses are fun to rip around on jet skis that offer arcade-style handling but are still anchored with some real world physics. The variety of events, smooth 3D, and good pacing make this an easy recommend to gamers with 3D-enabled handsets. Even though summer's on the decline, this is a great way to keep the sun out for a few extra weeks.", "date": "Oct 12, 2007"}
