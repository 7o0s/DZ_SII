This year, handsets are hosting a good half-dozen Olympic-esque games, from Sorrent's FOX Sports Track & Field to Overloaded's new Dan Parks Decathlon, a ten event track game that's aimed to put you in the Olympic spirit.     Features:   Ten events  Practice mode   Dan Parks Decathlon does not bring anything new to the table. However, before anybody takes that as a slight to Overloaded's new game, consider that there is certainly something to be said for refining an existing -- and successful -- formula. The game will remind you of two classic track games: Activision's original Decathlon and Konami's classic arcade game, Track and Field. If you've played either or both of those games, you understand what excellent pedigree that is.   The game consists of the classic ten events for the decathlon:   100-meter run  400-meter run  1,500-meter run  110-meter hurdles  discus  javelin  pole vault  high jump  shot put  long jump      Each game is controlled by a series of timed button presses. Unlike previous track games that required you to jam on the buttons as hard and fast as possible, Dan Parks Decathlon is more about nailed specific timed actions.   For example, when getting ready to throw the javelin, you must run down the long strip. There is an ~energy~ meter of sorts below your athlete. Instead of pounding on number keys, you must press the action key when the line is in the center of the meter, resulting in a nice speed boost. This is an excellent system, as we aren't fond of beating on our handsets just for the sake of a game. (We pound on our handsets when we get calls from Tyrone from IGN Cars.)   Each of the ten events is simple and well constructed. Naturally, the least fun of the bunch are running events. Because this is a decathlon, they are required inclusions, but they get dull. Fast. Better events are pole vault, shot put, and javelin. There is a legit feeling of minor accomplishment when you nail a record on those mini-games.   Dan Parks Decathlon is actually a very attractive little game. Big head Dan isn't a bad little hero. He's decently detailed, wears a colorful little outfit, and is animated quite well. The game's use of color is to be commended -- there's just a pleasing look to it that is missing in other track games.Dan Parks Decathlon is a very worthwhile download if you're feeling that Olympic spirit. Sure, you have to slog through the boring running events, but you did agree to participate in a decathlon, after all. And who knows, maybe you're the kind of gamer that likes rote activities like running simulations. With its incredibly attractive looks and solid game play, Overloaded has crafted a great summer download that will be enjoyed by many, many armchair Olympians.", "date": "Jul 14, 2004"}
