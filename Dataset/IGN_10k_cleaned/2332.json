That is,      until Namco dropped a coin-op bomb called Time      Crisis. To distinguish it from other light      gun games, Namco added two distinct      elements. First off, you're always on foot,      which lets you get into tight hallways and      cramped stairwells, and helps break up the      shooting gallery effect you get in      wide-open spaces. Secondly, and most      importantly, Namco incorporated a duck pedal.      This seemingly simple addition, which      allowed you to hide behind boxes and other      objects, giving the game a whole new      dimension of gameplay.        A PlayStation conversion was, of course,      demanded. And boy, has Namco delivered. The gameplay is as solid as ever and the graphics are almost (although not quite) as strong as the arcade's. And, just to prove you sometimes do get cake and get to eat it too,  it comes packaged with the Guncon, the best light gun available for the PlayStation. And it retails for $59.95. Yes!  The Guncon has an extra button on its side that mimics the pedal of the coin-op version. By pressing the button you rise from your hiding place, which can be anything from a stack of boxes to the far side of a corner. The game moves along a track, positioning you automatically at the next hiding area. You must kill all the enemies present to move on, and do it within a certain period of time -- hence the name, Time Crisis.  Where this game really excels, and where any light gun game should excel, is in the shooting. The Guncon is so damn accurate (down to one pixel) you really have to aim well. And, as the collision detection is so refined, you'll often be shooting at guys hiding behind cars, with just their heads exposed. This makes the game extremely challenging, but also extremely fun.  The full arcade story mode is here, in both regular and time attack modes (unlimited lives), as is an entirely new story mode, where you storm a hotel. Morals go out the door as you blast wave upon wave of bellboys and doormen, all wearing those funny, little chin strap hats (like the ones monkeys wear). The addition of this game (which is even harder than the arcade mode) adds tremendously to the value of the game, something most light gun games lack.  For all its overwhelming positives, Time Crisis isn't perfect. The gameplay can seem tedious at times, with no hostages to miss or bigger guns to power-up to. The lack of a two-player game is also a negative. However, if you can't get enough of solo shooting, these gripes shouldn't even apply.  All in all, Time Crisis is a superb game. The fact that it's a light gun game makes it even better. A must have.  Adam Douglas", "date": "Nov 12, 1997"}
