Most of the time, developers aren't really trying to attempt new and exotic ideas for the handheld market, and much of the reason comes down to the Almighty Dollar; to many companies it's financially not worth the effort to be innovative on the Game Boy Advance. Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand is the epitome of innovation on the Game Boy Advance. No game like Boktai has taken an original, out-there idea -- in this case, a sunlight sensor -- and incorporated almost the entire game design around it. The result is a very special and unique Game Boy Advance adventure with interesting and successful gameplay elements, and the only thing holding this game back is its time-restrictive gameplay and its use of unoriginal and redundant level challenges throughout the adventure. Features More than seven different locations Sunlight sensor with varying sensitivity Cartridge save with two slots Link cable support for two player (trades and battles)    Boktai follows Django, a young boy following in his father's footsteps as a sort of vampire hunter. It's Django's duty to seek out immortal beasts within infested realms, and banish them from existence by utilizing the power of the sun. Players, as Django, will have to traverse through dangerous, isometric levels and maps, destroying enemy undead creatures in order to get to the Immortal's lair. Once there, players must do battle with these godlike monsters and seal them into a crypt, which then must be dragged back through the undead-infested areas in order to wipe them out through the sunlight-powered Pile Driver.  What makes Boktai so special is the little plastic-covered device built into every cartridge: a sunlight sensor. This sensor can detect varying amounts of sunlight directed onto it, which is visually represented by a meter in the corner of the screen. The stronger the sunlight hitting the sensor, the more powerful the sun is in the game. And it's this element that drives many of the gameplay ideas within Boktai. It's main purpose is to fuel the game's weapon: players wield a pistol that harnesses the energy from the sun, and as players blast away with this weapon, its ammo, sunlight energy, is depleted, and it can only be replenished with either direct sunlight or sunlight stored within batteries scattered around the levels. And players can't just harness the sunlight anywhere in the game to replenish their weapons; their character, Django, has to either be in outdoor locations, or find ~skylights~ represented by beams cast on the floors. Standing in the lighted areas will slowly fill the gun's battery, but it also can be more quickly replenished by standing in place and pressing the A button; but this is a bad thing to do when Django is surrounded by blood-thirsty enemies.  The strength of the sun is extremely important in Boktai, and the sunlight sensor is very sensitive to how much light it receives. Play the game in the morning sun at 8:30 could net your power meter three or four notches, compared to the seven or eight notches you'll get at one or two in the afternoon. The higher the notches in the meter, the more powerful the sun is in Boktai, and strong sunlight makes replenishing and accumulate sunlight energy a lot more rapid in the game. It also means that the windows and cracks in the wall also let in stronger energy, which can be used against enemies by leading them into these spots on the floor for an easy kill. Boss battles in particular use these patches of light quite well.  But the sun can also work against you. There are some enemies that ~hide~ from the light, so they'll appear invisible unless you cover the sensor from the light. But more importantly is Boktai's ~safety~ feature: if there's too much light hitting the sensor, your weapon will eventually overheat, rendering it useless. The only way to remedy this is to cast shade over the sensor to cool it down; and since the gameplay pretty much requires a constant stream of sunlight energy, this is the game's polite way of telling you that you've played enough. Not only does the cartridge have a sun sensor, it also has an internal clock, so it will remember just how long the game's been sitting in the shade, or turned off completely. It's presumably so that players don't get too much sun and damage their skin.     Hideo Kojima, the man at Konami who brought the Metal Gear series to life is credited for the design of Boktai and its innovative use of a sunlight sensor to drive many of the gameplay elements. It's clear that he at least had some inspiration in the design, especially since much of strategy involved in getting through the levels is similar to what's involved in getting through Metal Gear worlds. In Boktai, the many different undead creatures wander aimlessly over the map, only becoming aware of your presence if you either jump into their line of sight or make a noise within earshot. Getting their attention accidentally can result in serious damage to your character's health, so it's best to take the paths slow and steadily so as not to get noticed. The designers even throw in the very Snake-like wall-tap move; push Django up against a wall to sneak closely around corners, and rap your knuckles against the wall to get their attention. This move is encouraged all over the game in many clever level designs. For example, players will need to trick an enemy to wander over to a spot in the hallway to trigger a pressure plate; tapping the wall in that particular area will draw their attention to see what made that noise, giving players time to run through the gate that'll open after the floor plate's tripped.  But as original as Boktai's focus is, the levels are typical and familiar because they focus on redundant ~crate-shoving~ and ~switch-flipping~ puzzles in order to advance through the adventure. You know the type: players will have to push gigantic boxes around areas to fit into specific and convenient crate-sized gaps in order to trigger a pressure switch or to create a bridge to cross...or locate wall switches and flip them in a proper order. These are all over Boktai's maps, which makes the game have a slightly routine feel in its largely unique design.  The game's development is very solid with large, wonderfully  animated characters and decent special effects that inject a lot of life in the production. The controls and commands are simplistic because the designers limit the players moves; he can't jump or climb ledges, for example. But the limitations actually work in this game since they honestly don't feel like the controls have been restricted.  And even though I ragged on the crate-sliding level design, I am impressed with what the developers had to do in terms of level layout, since they had to not only create challenges going into the Immortal lair, but also create challenges dragging the trapped creature back to the Pile Driver outside.  It does have to be mentioned that gamers are pretty restricted into how, when, and where they can play Boktai, which might limit your enjoyment of this adventure. Don't get me wrong, I understand that this is entirely the designers' intention, and it's something that definitely builds up the game's uniqueness. But, it's somewhat awkward to have a system like the Game Boy Advance, a system that encourages gaming freedom, and to be tied down to specific times and lighting conditions on when it's okay to play Boktai. The developers include many ideas that allow players to continue in the quest when the sunlight conditions are less than optimal, like the batteries and Sun Banks scattered throughout the levels. But since these energy withdrawal items aren't always readily available like the skylights are, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to advance in the game without the actual, physical sun cast down on the sensor. But hey, it does keep players from beating the game in one sitting... I wholeheartedly respect Konami for attempting something incredibly original and unique on a system that rarely sees anything but the routine. Boktai focus on sunlight as a gameplay element is remarkably different, and has enormous potential in game design. I wouldn't be surprised if this game only scratches the surface in terms of what the game designers at Konami have come up with during Boktai's adventure. I don't think the game design they came up with for Boktai is quite as epic as their Castlevania or Metal Gear Solid series due to some redundant and formulaic level creation, but it's still a good, solid adventure on the Game Boy Advance, and  Konami definitely deserves the props for bringing something out of the ordinary to the portable system.", "date": "Sep 16, 2003"}
