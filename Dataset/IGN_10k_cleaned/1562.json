Now I am disgruntled, annoyed, and generally displeased that I was the one that had to review this one. What could have been a great game with some great ideas and fairly spectacular graphics turned out to be a problematic, frustrating, and incredible short journey through the exploits of a very bald hitman.  The game starts out with you, the hitman, waking up in a patient's robe in some kind ofhospital. At this point, you start getting your training in the game via the quirky voice that sounds like Dracula or something. You go through various training exercises learning how to strangle, stab, shoot, and distinguish between targets and innocents. If you aren't familiar with shooters at all, there may be something for you here, but otherwise, this tutorial mission is largely useless. Luckily, you can just run through it if you need to, especially to escape the droning of the Dracula. He even chimes in a certain parts with encouragements such as, ~good, not many get this far.~ Why is that? There isn't a certain score you need to get on anything to get by... Whatever.  But all of this brings me to one of my rather large annoyances with this game. There are no mid-mission saves. So if you get close to the end of a mission and end up screwing up, you go all the way back to start without your $200. They even did this in the tutorial for crying out loud. The first time I got to the end of the tutorial a nurse ran up to me and shocked me. I didn't shoot him because I had no idea that I was trying to break out of the hospital, I thought I was being trained. The point is that I had to start back at the beginning of the tutorial and run through the whole stupid thing over again. This is especially annoying when the missions are set up so that you have to play them a few times before you can even really know what you are doing. And some of them take a long damn time to run through the dumb stuff again. I don't want to run through all of the easy challenges at the beginning of a mission all over again, I want to figure out the next problem. I was cussing like crazy at this game, not because I died really, but because I had to start all the way over again.  There was one feature that tried to help that problem I guess. Some of the missions save your progress along the way. You get two lives so if you die once you'll start somewhere in the middle of a mission. The problem with that is, that if you died, chances are that the guy that killed you let all of his buddies know, and they'll all be waiting for you when you get back to where you died. So you'll end up having to start all the way over again anyway.  So after the tutorial, you start on your assignments from ~The Agency.~ They give you various missions, which you'll need to complete to get you money to buy weapons with which to do the missions. Throughout the game, you'll get little hints as to what you can expect from the plot. But it isn't exactly brain intensive, I had it figured out early in the game, it was just a matter of getting to what turned out to be an underwhelming climax.  Each of your missions will take you into various locations around the world such as Hong Kong, Columbia, Budapest, and Rotterdam. Which brings me to the beautiful environments. The graphics really are superb. Lots of bright colors, beautiful textures, and well-animated characters flush out the levels. Unfortunately, you'll need a pretty good machine to run the game well. While it wasn't that bad on my machine, those with less than my TNT2 might well want to play the demo first to see if their system can handle it.  In each of the missions, you'll be given goals that involve eliminating various figures, tracking targets down, recovering items, disarming bombs, and the like. You know, your everyday contract killer fare that should be a whole lot of fun to do. So sad... This is where the wheels come off and the car flies into a ditch.  The control system in Hitman is frustrating. Very frustrating sometimes. What should be a neat thing of getting to off targets, drag them into corners, strip them and take their weapons and any items you might need, turns into a mess when surrounded by piles of bodies. The right click menu system can help, but when you're in a hurry, it doesn't always get the job done.  And the camera... Ugh, the camera. I can't tell you how many times I died because walls popped and blocked my view or I got stuck in a corner with the camera pointing in an odd direction. Just check out the video below and you'll see what I mean. That particular example is a bit much because I was trying to record the video and play and talk and the same time, but it gives a pretty good idea. The third person view they've adopted in this game really doesn't work. Either they should have backed the camera up from the character like Alice or should have done it in first person. I like the 3rd person myself because I like to see the character, but it just didn't work right in Hitman. They did have an alternate 3rd person camera, but it was even worse and only good for taking certain screenshots.  This isn't to say there weren't a whole lot of good ideas in the game. I really did like the whole disguise thing for example. You could strip any clothes off of unlucky victims to masquerade as one of the bad guys, or a bellhop, or a cop, or a citizen... But almost none of the clothes disguised that big fat bald head. How I managed to fool the guards of the Hong Kong mafia by changing into a new set of clothes when I still had that American accent, big fat bald head, and pale white face I'll never know. When standing waist deep in dead bodies with one of my victim's Asian guard clothes on, I was easily able to fool the guards with a lifted eyebrow and an, ~I think he went that way.~ Oh well, so much for realism. On the other end of the coin, guards would sometimes know I was a bad guy when I hadn't done anything suspicious at all. I was carrying a pistol and an uzi, both holstered, minding my own business, and then some punk screams, ~Alarm! Alarm! I've got a situation here!~ and everything goes to hell. See ya in hell Hitman.  The thing is, if it hadn't have been for the slew of other problems in the game, I could easily have overlooked all of that and had myself a right good time. I was having a pretty good time through the first couple of missions actually. They were pretty well designed and gave me a good chance to test out my skills and how the game mechanics worked. I love sneaky shooters like Thief but Hitman never decided it wanted to be a sneaker. There are quite a few bits where you just have to wade into the throng, guns blazing. It was a bit fun to mow enemies down every now and again, but this game deserved more situations that needed creative solutions than it had. It is very possible to just walk into some of the levels where you are supposed to be covert about things and just blow everything that moves away instead. But if helps that the guards in a separate part of the building can't always hear the noise of an MP5 firing round after round into the thick skins of the various enemies.   And I do mean thick skins. Somehow, you can strangle guards with no problem at all in a couple of seconds, but can't even get them to limp by shooting them in various spots around the body six or seven times. The only sure one shot kill is the back of the head cause I actually did hit one in the face, but he still managed to shoot me back a couple of times. I guess I made him angry.  Eventually, you'll find yourself done with the game. You'll look at the clock and say, didn't I start playing this in the morning? I beat this game in 15 hours at the most and half of that was running back through levels trying to get back to the point where I did something stupid, which is probably why there was no save feature. All of that useless running around was all that kept the game from being a 10 hour game. And once you're done, you probably won't want to go back through again. Once you've figured how to complete the level, there's really not much point.  What can I say? I'm disappointed. I really had been looking forward to this one and it let me down in so many ways. If only it had been longer... If only the camera had been different... If only it had been a bit more mentally challenging... If only Tal hadn't given me this game to review...  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
