While Jamaican Bobsled doesn't have an official Olympic license, it does have the rights to the actual Jamaican team -- the underdog heroes that were popularized in the Disney movie Cool Runnings. It's a loose enough connection to capitalize on any exposure granted by the Winter Olympics.   But let there be no doubt -- Jamaican Bobsled is no simulation. In fact, this is more of a kart racer, as evidenced by icy chutes full of coins, wrenches, and magnets. However, unlike most kart racers, the track is devoid of any direct competition; the only thing between you and the gold is your own thumb. And unfortunately, in the case of Jamaican Bobsled, your thumb might just not be good enough to get the job done.   Sometimes, things get a little too crazy while you're zooming down the ice. You must collect as many coins as humanly possible to juice your score, but there is no shortage of obstacles in your way, such as ice blocks and penguins. There are power-ups that help your cause, such as the magnets that attract coins around you and springs that launch you over obstacles. You also need to keep an eye out for rocket boosts, so you can get enough speed to do loops in the chute and pick up the coins that hang in the air.   I've played Jamaican Bobsled on two different handsets: a Sanyo 8100 and an LG VX7000. I thought the control was too loose on each handset. I know that I'm racing on ice here, but it was just too easy to over-steer and slip all over the track. And without any competition to contend with, just the same goals of collecting coins and avoiding the same hazards (just in different places), I failed to see any compelling reason to keep digging into the game.   I cannot fault the game for a lack of content. There are no fewer than twenty tracks in the Arcade Mode and 10 tracks in the Championship mode. Tracks can be played over and over in an effort to beat previous times and earn medals. Nor can I fault it for its production values, which are strong. The musical tracks that accompany the day-glo visuals are appealing, to say the least. The whole game screams ~happy,~ with its use of wild colors and rhythmic tunes.  Jamaican Bobsled is an OK game -- some might be entertained by its breezy gameplay, but my interest quickly waned. There is certainly no shortage of things to do in the game (it's loaded with tracks) but I just didn't like the ~feel~ of the game, thanks to slippery controls and repetitive game play. Gamers looking for a simple kart racer with eye-catching visuals might be decently serviced by Jamaican Bobsled, but if you're really in the mood for a racing game, there are better options out there.", "date": "Jan 12, 2006"}
