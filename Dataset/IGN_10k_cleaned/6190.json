As many of you might already know if you've played Worms 3D or any of the 2D Worms games of the past, the point of the game is to strategically position your of cute cartoon worms and annihilate the enemy team through the use of over-the-top weaponry. Eliminating your foes can occur by directly damaging them with weapons, knocking them into bodies of water, or triggering some of the environmental pitfalls like land mines and poisonous barrels.   Just like in Worms 3D, players will find a substantial amount of single player content in Mayhem. In addition to a tutorial, the game features a challenge mode and a story mode. In the challenge mode players will be able to participate in various mini games like sniping or shotgunning targets. As you beat one you'll unlock the next, though these can get old rather quickly since they're somewhat repetitive. You'll have a better time in the game's story mode. Though the plotline is total garbage, it basically consists of you going on a ~field trip~ to complete various objectives. Eventually a time machine is mixed in and you head to different maps to fight different enemies.   What's cool about the story mode is that it plants you on unique maps and charges you with specific challenges. Instead of just killing your enemies you'll be given the chance to detonate certain objectives and in some cases do some platforming. The destruction objectives are entertaining and help to expand some of Worms' gameplay. For instance, in one level you'll be charged with blowing up several wind generators located across an island chain. As you hit the generators, grenade tossing enemies that float on clouds will appear near you. You'll only have control of one worm, so you'll have to take the enemy out and continue destroying the generators until they're all turned to rubble. Before the end of the mission you'll have to battle a boss worm.   As refreshing a change of pace those missions are, the missions where you're forced to perform platforming actions are a real pain. In some you'll have to use a combination of girder laying, parachuting, and doing backflips to properly reach collectible items you'll need to obtain in order to complete a stage. The problem arises from the controls being unreliable. For instance, if you're too close to a wall and you try to hop over it, your worm will fly backwards. This normally isn't a problem since you can just try again, but if you're on a narrow cliff then you'll wind up either drowning or taking massive fall damage. If you do wind up surviving the fall you'll have to go through and redo all the platforming puzzles you've already completed. This can be frustrating given that your character controls aren't as precise as they should be and this really isn't a platforming title anyway.    With that being said, the PC version of Mayhem is much improved in terms of control over the console versions. It is way easier to aim your shots, view your surroundings, and check your positioning before you jump around. There is no longer the frustration of having to move your cursor five or six times over the same spot to try and get the exact aim you want. In other words, one of the largest problems with the console version is demolished by a mouse and keyboard, making this version of Worms without a doubt superior.   Even though the control issues are much improved, the three dimensional aspect is still awkward. I'm not complaining that it's difficult, many games are, it just seems unnecessarily difficult to properly aim long distance shots. For anything close range or large targets, the game works fine. For pinpointing small targets at long distances, though, the game is much more difficult than was its 2D predecessors. In addition, the 3D maps make it much harder to tell how objects like grenades will bounce or roll once they've hit the ground. Also, the transition between an attack, notification of how much damage was inflicted, and the next turn needs to be sped up. As it is, you'll spend an overly long amount of time just waiting for the game to process all the actions. There are some new weapons available to players, most notably the sniper rifle. This weapon is actually useful in the PC version since your control is much more precise.     Now that we've got those issues out of the way, let me say that Worms has an absolutely amazing array of customization options. First and foremost are the additions of a create a weapon feature, create a team, and create a game mode. Basically, these modes let you create the most ridiculous looking Worms you could ever want to, including ones with military hats, disco glasses, blonde handlebar mustaches, and pirate gloves. All sorts of crazy weapons can be customized and all their attack parameters such as worm damage, environmental damage, poison effect, delivery type, among a huge list of others can be set. The game style creation tool is of an equal depth to the others, letting you tweak six pages full of different options.   There's more still, including a random game condition generator called the Wormpot, tons of unlockable content you can purchase with coins won in the story mode, and a huge array of preset weaponry, so you'll never feel limited.   Of course, Worms is a game that's meant to be played with more than one person, and this game definitely provided options for just that. Up to four players can compete with one PC or you can take your game online over a LAN or the Internet. This is definitely the high point of Worms 4: Mayhem, and will keep you playing this game for a long time.    In terms of visuals the game isn't much to look at. However, the PC version is significantly sharper than the console versions, though it doesn't break any new graphical ground. It's bright, it's cartoony, and it animates smoothly, but there's noting especially detailed or impressive to speak of. The explosions are decent and spray some landscape chunks into the air but the textures are large devoid of intricacies. Character design is equally simple, with many of the game's landscapes and objects looking blocky and dated. The cinematic story sequences in PC are possess a grainy quality not present in the console version.   The sound is less impressive than the graphics, especially the character voices. In the PC version, the worms definitely seem to be more talkative and expressive. Still, the intelligible chirps the worms utter when delivering lines of dialogue is more aggravating than cute, and the weapon sounds are tinny and weak, though I suppose this has been the case with all Worms games. Through it all the game still manages to maintain a sense of cheery humor, especially in the death messages that appear at the top of the screen.  Worms 4: Mayhem incorporates even more customization options than its predecessors to provide a truly mind-boggling array of gameplay possibilities. To best experience this game it's definitely worthwhile to gather together a few friends or take your game online. For those more inclined towards playing alone there is definitely a variety of play options, and I'm happy to report that the imprecise joystick control that hampered the console versions is ameliorated by the mouse and keyboard. Hopefully in future Worms titles the game mechanics will be perfected so the 3D version of Worms to be as accessible and enjoyable as the original 2D games were. The PC version is definitely the superior, and it's only 20 bucks.", "date": "Oct 19, 2005"}
