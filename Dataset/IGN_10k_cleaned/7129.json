What's even more infuriating is that Microsoft has the nerve to charge 30 dollars for a product that basically amounts to a semi-large patch for many games.   In the interest of time, let's take a look at the first paragraph of the last review we wrote for the Endangered Species expansion pack!    ~A good expansion pack is really about not only creating new content and gameplay, but making good changes to the way a game plays. One of the best expansion packs ever made, Brood Wars for the original StarCraft, managed to completely alter the way the game worked while maintaining game balance and adding tons of content. While Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species is in a much different genre, the rules still apply. An expansion needs to have content and gameplay improvements that help make the game something more than it was.~   While Endangered Species wasn't exactly good with the amount of features and content added, African Adventure manages to be worse. It's like Blue Fang and Microsoft decided that it was a better idea to do the exact opposite of the general opinion and create an expansion with even less content for the same high price. Whether this is an experiment to see if fans of the series will continue to buy content updates for that much cash or just plain laziness, African Adventure is not worth the money unless you're absolutely desperate for new animals and have gotten tired of those offered for download on some of the fansites.    What's even more surprising is that while there are no new gameplay features, there are also no new gameplay improvements either. Little things that have been annoying from the start such as the lack of fast forwarding are still a problem. How is that even possible? African Adventure should have been offered for the same as the Dino Danger pack at 4.99.   The good news about this is that the reviewing process is extraordinarily easy. Simply load the game up, check out the maps, play the small campaign series, look at the new animals, plop down the nifty new Jeep models to watch them move around, and call it a day. So maybe we should be thanking Blue Fang and Microsoft for making our jobs easier.This is a sad excuse for an expansion pack. For 30 dollars (almost the price of a full game) there had better be some gameplay additions or at the very least some gameplay improvements. Instead, customers are going to find a number of new African animals, new Jeeps, and new maps, all of which could easily have been served up by an active community. If this pack had been offered for 20 dollars less, the content provided would be adequate. As it is, save your money and wait for the inevitable Zoo Tycoon 3.", "date": "Aug 15, 2006"}
