I say 'had' because this year has seen the release of some truly spectacular first-person shooters, each of which moves the genre in new and interesting directions. Aware on some instinctual level that other titles had supplanted her in my mind, Monolith decided to bring Cate out of retirement in No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way. And for those of you who don't have time to read the whole review, the sequel's as good as the original. Not only does it preserve everything we liked about the first game but it also takes a few steps in some rewarding new directions.   Cate Archer is still working for UNITY and trying to thwart H.A.R.M.'s latest plan, Project Omega. While it first seems pretty tame -- setting up a nice vacation spot for Communists -- it soon spills over into something larger with the USSR and the US teetering on the brink of nuclear annihilation. Over the course of forty missions set in more than a dozen locations, you're expected to sort all this out and save the world...again. Along the way you make new friends, meet new enemies and turn old enemies into allies.   You'll also run across many of your favorite characters from the first game. Bruno's back, this time with a big promotion, and you can still find the wonderful Dr. Schenker hard at work for the UNITY cause. A wheelchair-bound Volkov returns along with H.A.R.M.'s Scottish bad boy Magnus Armstrong. There are plenty of new characters to meet as well including H.A.R.M.'s aggravated new director and Isako, leader of the female ninjas. By far, the best of the new baddies is the leader of the fiendish mimes. In fact, that whole group is hysterical but I won't spoil it by telling you how or why -- although it really ought to be obvious.   Humor was one of the things that the original game was particularly good at and the same approach is apparent in the sequel. You're probably already aware from the demo that Cate fights a bunch of ninjas in trailer park while a tornado bears down on them. Once it gets going, the game is full of this kind of campy, tongue-in-cheek humor. Again, saying too much would spoil things, but there are outrageous death traps, tons of wacky gadgets and plenty of witty dialogue, all of which are faithful yet irreverent towards the stereotypes of 60s spy movies.   As befits a game featuring a secret agent, stealth is much more a part of things now. A new icon lets you keep track of how hidden and stealthy you really are. Move slow and low through dark areas and you'll be practically invisible. There's a lean in the game now as well, so you can get a peek around that corner before walking past it. And since there are now a few enemies that you won't exactly be able to kill, stealth becomes even more important.   The levels are also designed much more openly now, with two or three ways to get in and out of each area. And while you can take advantage of this to get around behind your enemies, they can do the same to you. The game compensates for this by giving you a new set of traps -- banana peels, bear traps -- to lay in places enemies might approach. Cool locator darts can be shot at enemies and let you track them around the levels. Cameras can be circumvented with yet another kind of dart, giving you a little more freedom to get around.   When you do cause commotion, you'll notice that the guards are much more alert to disturbances now and are better able to approach a situation in a rational manner. Whether on larger, outdoor levels or inside cramped buildings, the guards seem to work together to get at least a few of them in position to attack you from the sides or rear. I've laughed at guards as they ran away only to find out they were merely finding a way to sneak up behind me. Unfortunately, nearly all of the guards still have a tendency to run over and investigate dead bodies. As long as they can't see or hear you, they're biggest concern seems to be running up and standing right on top of the guy you just sniped. On some of the levels with good cover and low visibility, you can really rack up some snipe piles.   While the levels allow for a fair bit of flexibility, the missions themselves are very tightly centered on the collection of a seemingly endless stream of items. The whole urgency of the game shifts in to low gear once you've spent 20 minutes looking for that last briefcase. Then there are the classic instances where a whole chain of things have to occur in order to trigger a single event. To open a door, you have to restore the power, to restore the power you have to find the generator. Then you discover that the generator's missing a fuse, and etcetera. There's even a fair bit of backtracking in some of the larger levels as you move from one objective to another through areas you've already cleared.   You're led around now by a compass that indicates the direction towards your objectives or the various zone exits for the larger levels. There's no indication of the distance to the objective and the display is narrow enough in range that you can appear to be on top of something according to the compass but still be a bit off in the game world. There's also a much more convenient gadget system. If you're holding your pistol and try to ~use~ a coded note, you automatically switch to your decoder. Likewise, if you're facing a locked door, you'll automatically get your lockpicks or welding torch out. What makes this system work is that the ~use~ command that appears when these objects are encountered is grayed out, so you can always recognize when you'll need to use a different item. No One Lives Forever 2 also adds a lot more information to the objectives screen. Now you'll have access to all of the intelligence you've gathered at any point in a mission. You'll also be able to pull up descriptions of weapons or a list of mission objectives at any time.   I also like the improved skill system. While the original game hinted at some sort of ability advancement for Cate, this one brings it right to the forefront and lets you improve certain characteristics between missions. Spending points earned by completing objectives or accumulating intelligence items, you improve your efficiency or effectiveness. Boost your marksmanship skill and you suffer fewer aiming penalties from moving or firing bursts. But marksmanship also affects how quickly you reload and the stability of the sniper scope. Train in gadgets to defuse bombs faster, or train carrying to cart around more ammo.    Not only does the skill system help you tailor the game to your tastes, it also provides a compelling incentive to gather up as much intelligence and complete as many bonus objectives as you can. You'll get skill points for each item you discover and each task you accomplish. You spend these skill points at any time during the game to raise a particular ability to a higher level and, naturally, higher levels require more skill points. By the end of the game you'll have made a number of these improvements and helped to define a little bit of what your character really is. The changes aren't all that drastic in the early stages of the game but once you start to get towards the end of the game, you'll really need the extra boosts just to stay alive.   But while the game puts more of an emphasis on seeking out the extra pieces of information that are scattered throughout the level (~Where's that plan for our nuclear submarine, Ivan?~ ~Why, lying under the chair in the storage room, Steve!~), it actually reduces the amount of weapons, ammunition, health and armor you run across. The lion's share of these items will have to be lifted off of your dead or incapacitated enemies through a new search function. If you just search an enemy for a second, you can get the weapon they're carrying in their hand. If you're willing to search for a few seconds, you can get much more -- ammo, armor, first aid kits, and even hundreds of little throwaway items like used tissues or movie tickets.   As you can see from the screenshots, the game looks fantastic. Using the latest LithTech Jupiter engine, No One Lives Forever 2 can render the large expanses of Siberia as well as the cramped interior of an underwater submarine pen. While there are plenty of more exotic levels (Ohio, Japan, etc.), my own favorite is Calcutta. The exteriors and architecture here are simply stunning and really show off the range of the Jupiter engine. Explosions and particles seem a little canned in some places, but they're convincing enough that you won't be too distracted. Apart from the odd clipping problems, the engine is stable and runs quite well on the recommended spec.   The character models are just as good as the architecture. The faces and bodies are rendered with such detail and move with such realistic animations that you can't help but be caught up in the action. Although there aren't very many points of articulation on the faces, the characters convey a remarkable level of emotion with their eyes. The eyes of the characters move around in their sockets now and you'll see the eyes track the action in a cutscene. This also opens to the door to some shifty side-to-side glancing and, better still, characters actually rolling their eyes at the game itself. Watch for Cate's first meeting with Magnus.   In light of that, I'm glad Monolith resisted the temptation to overdo it with the cutscenes. These sequences were often the funniest part of the first game but they tended to drag a bit, especially those horrid meetings with Frick and Frack at UNITY headquarters. This time around, the scenes are much shorter and lead right in to the action. On a similar note, the interminable hours spent in Santa's Workshop (where Cate gets all her equipment) have been erased altogether. Now Santa appears throughout the game in the form of a robotic bird that appears within the missions and helps get you oriented without requiring an entirely separate level.   What did you think of No One Lives Forever 2?   If the single-player campaign isn't your thing there's only a short cooperative campaign to keep you busy. Composed of four chapters borrowing levels and story elements from the single player game, it lets you and three other friends tackle a small mini-mission. You can save and reload these sessions (they're long enough that this is necessary) which makes it pretty convenient. But while the single-player experience is the focus here (as it should be), I'd like to see more multiplayer options -- things like deathmatch seem basic enough to require little extra work.Every once in a while you come across some jerk prophesying the end of PC gaming. You see at least a couple of these statements every time a new console is released, and the recent launches of the big three have been no exception. No One Lives Forever 2 is proof that these people are idiots. I like to think of PC game development alternating between overlapping periods of innovation and refinement. Right now the basic principles of shooter design are fairly well understood; the challenge for developers is to add layers of meaning and interest on top of this model.Along with No One Lives Forever 2, it's titles like Mafia and Medal of Honor and Jedi Outcast that best express this promising new approach to developing first person shooters -- an approach that puts as much emphasis on personality and atmosphere as on technology. Like the first game, No One Lives Forever 2 displays this quality perfectly. It's clear the developers care as much about style and humor as they do about framerates and weapon balance.We were all having a conversation the other day about the unusually high number of first-rate first-person shooters that have come out this year. In each case, they stand out because of something beyond the basic game mechanic: they build identity with you and actually get you to believe in the worlds they conjure up. That they can do so while never neglecting the action is great news for us.In a year of fantastic shooters, No One Lives Forever 2 stands with the best.", "date": "Oct 2, 2002"}
