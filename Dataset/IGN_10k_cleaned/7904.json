Shrek, Madagascar, and now Over the Hedge have all seen games come out during the theatrical and DVD releases of their films. Vicarious Visions, known for innovative gameplay, has made a game that takes a separate course from all of its other console counterparts. It's crazy, sometimes fun, sometimes annoying, and always bright. Just like Hammy.Hammy Goes Nuts is different from all the other versions of the game. How different? Whereas the Nintendo DS version is an action adventure title, the GBA version is a miniature golf game. Oh yes. Vicarious Visions decided to make the entire game based around small woodland creatures playing putt-putt. And guess what? It actually works. The story starts off simple enough. Hammy's cable TV goes out, and to help him ass the time RJ and Verne teach him to play golf. As the friends go to find the cause of the cable shortage the encounter a beaver trapped in a cage. It's then that they figure out to use golf for their mischief. Hitting crap with golf balls as hard as possible is a lot safer than trying to break things themselves.There are two types of layouts for breaking the human's stuff in this game. The first is a basic golf layout, with the hole at the end being represented by a refrigerator, tool shed, or other large object. The second is a series of objects that all need to be broken by bouncing the ball between them. Preventing this from being a simple putting exercise, the course has a number of traps and obstacles blocking the way. In order to get the perfect shot, Hammy must arrange the course, moving the obstacles out of the way. Hammy runs around in a top down view - cute as ever - interacting with the various objects and planning out how to complete the level. After he fixes things just so, players switch to another character and hit the ball. Between shots players can switch back to Hammy, rearranging the course to accommodate them.The courses are brightly colored and pretty large, usually someone's yard or living room. They start off simple enough, with only one or two objects to move. As the game progresses more items get thrown into the mix. Diagonal blocks to bounce off of, bumpers, cushions, tunnels, even windmills make the courses get increasingly more complicated, and makes the game more interesting. Even with all of the junk in the way, the courses are never very difficult. Getting the ball in each hole in the given number of strokes is always easy, though completing it in par or one under (super par) requires some careful maneuvering. The game's obviously geared towards children, and so the difficulty level is acceptable. For kids that do blaze through the story, there is a Challenge mode that gets unlocked, offering more difficult courses and less allowed strokes.For players that prefer a more traditional minigolf game, there is an Arcade mode that takes out the Hammy aspect of the game. There are a decent amount of courses offered, and though it's not as interesting as the other game mode, there is a substantial amount of gameplay. There are nine playable characters available, most of the cast from the movie. All of them have their own style and makeshift golf club, though they all control the same.The physics in the game are spot on. The ball bounces realistically against walls and objects and has an accurate amount of speed. Sometimes the courses feel out of the player's control. Many times players will have Hammy set up everything and all it takes is a put straight up and everything takes care of itself. It's cool a few times, but it takes away from the whole golf experience.Let's face it; miniature golf is a multiple person affair. Getting a hole-in-one is only cool if players can rub it in the face of their friends. Hammy Goes Nuts actually features a single cart multiplayer mode, though it feels tacked on. It's the same as Arcade mode, but up to four players can pass the GBA to each other when it's their turn. Okay, so that's not particularly exciting, but at least there is something for kids to share, which is a lot more than most GBA games offer today.Hammy Goes Nuts is not what people would expect an Over the Hedge game to be. It's innovative, which is nice since license games can get particularly stale. The game is very cute and vibrant, and the characters are all designed well enough to actually be able to tell exactly who they are. The game starts to get repetitive though, and at times it's like the game is playing itself with how crazy it gets. Still, there's a lot to do, with the different modes and multiplayer. Hammy Goes Nuts is definitely worth a look, for people that don't mind a game that's a little nuts.", "date": "Jan 11, 2007"}
