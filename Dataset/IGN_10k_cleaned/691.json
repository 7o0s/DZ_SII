Even after Gran Turismo 2 took the racing trophy for overall best racer (despite a few technical flaws), the amount of room for fun, speedy, action-packed games is still wide open. Nascar Rumble fills the void perfectly. A genetic hybrid of cars, racers, and regalia from Nascar is woven together with the shortcut, high-flying style of SF Rush to create a truly arcade-style experience like none other on this system.   Gameplay The Nascar we all know (and whom some love) is based on the professional sport of souped-up racing cars that speed infinitely around an oval steering left. (OK, I admit it I don't know anyone who loves, or even likes, Nascar racing.) But that's not what this is. This is as close to San Francisco Rush as the PlayStation gets, with a few new elements thrown in for good measure. (SF Rush bombed on the PS about two years ago.) These cars are still as powerful as in real life, but now they race on 18 courses all across the continent, each course packed with clever short cuts, power-ups, and highly competitive AI.   The videogame replicas of real Nascar vehicles are burly, indestructible, leaping things that are as solid as bulldozers. They burst through walls, waterfalls, bricks, and bash into each other and just keep going. All of the cars are from the actual Nascar teams, all with the appropriate decals, strips, etc, and each mixes up various characteristics or speed, endurance, control, etc. There are even a few oddball Nascar trucks thrown in there. They're able to flip, spin, and summersault in mid-air.   The game really is a strange hybrid that works on several levels, the most apparent of which is the sense of speed. It's blisteringly fast. The frame rates appear to run at a constant 30 FPS, no matter how many cars are on-screen, creating G-forces that are delicious to any racing fan. What's more, your car, no matter which of the 30-plus cars (or trucks) you pick, has this unearthly ability to accelerate on a dime. I can't tell you how gratifying it is to go from 0-90 in three seconds.  Nascar Rumble is set up with several courses ready to compete on. Three courses belong to a Locale, of which there are six, totaling 18 total tracks altogether, a nice thick number. Players can race on any course in Single Race, but in Championship, they must win either two out of three races (or earn the most points from the three races) to take the Gold Cup. Having taken the Cup you can race the ~Legend~ of that Locale, and by beating him you can race in that area in his car, which is cool, because it's always faster than what you're driving. Taking the cup also unlocks a bonus track, Locale, or vehicle category.   Like I said before, this is not a regular Nascar game. There are no oval courses. Instead, all tracks are all rugged original terrain, ranging from country roads, to city streets, to beach courses, to pig farms. The tracks are riddled with shortcuts and surprise paths that jump over standard paths, or lead to new branches, or criss-cross above normal paths. In some cases you need to take risks to get to them, by attempting to bash through wrong way signs, houses, mine shafts, or dangerous hollows. Whatever hiding technique you desire, the development team designed the courses to be a hell of a lot of fun.   Having said all these good things, one of the most troublesome parts of the game for me is the Mario Kart-style power-up system. The 11 original power-ups (that can be switched off) range from Bad Gas (slows your car) to Twister (throws your car into the air), to Nitro (speed boost), to Big Rumble (transforms your front grill into a weapon), plus seven more. Frankly, I hated the power up races. I just switched them off in Options. They probably make the game fun for kids under 12, but for anyone over, they lose them, and they sweep out all of the skill. I could be in first place for three-plus laps and then suddenly lose. I could be in last for the whole race and win because I threw a Twister at some sap.   I have played Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, Diddy Kong Racing, Chocobo Racing, Crash Team Racing, and every other kart game under the sun, and only a few of stand out. The best of them blend skill, the timely use of power-ups, knowledge of the tracks, and a little luck to create a fun party game. They're usually four-player games, too. In Nascar Rumble, you need about as much skill as an Orangutan to win a power-up race (and only against one other real racer). Some would call this beauty, or a game with universal appeal. I call it a game that's trying to be too many things. Nascar Rumble is a strange blend of high-powered arcade racing that's good, and power-ups style bombardment that's pretty good, but together it's like oil and vinegar, like the Odd Couple. It doesn't quite live so happily in the same apartment.   Graphics Aside from the blistering frame rate, the game is well laid out, and has plenty of courses. Not all of them stand out so well that I remember falling in love with them, but I did enjoy a few, especially those with lots of air time.   Visually, the game looks like a PlayStation game with most of the inherent problems the PlayStation presents: it's somewhat pixelly and crunchy, but because the game moves so fast -- you hardly get a chance to see everything slowly and in detail -- they're actually great. Don't get me wrong, the game actually looks pretty good, especially the car designs, which are like testosterone-induced in looks, and the environments are wonderfully thought-out, so really it's a solid looking game, but it's no prize winner.   Sound One of the best things about Nascar Rumble is the sound. The engines roar to a height that is entirely intoxicating. I mean, I never thought that the sound of an engine revving could have such an effect. And with the power-ups turned on, there is a constant clatter of events, especially cars smashing into walls and mostly each other. One of the most effective sound effects is hearing a car coming up from behind you. I'm not quite sure how EA did it, but when an opponent zooms up from behind, the chill is cold and quick. It's very effective.   The other aspect of the sound I liked was the announcer. He's always humorous, but when he's actually funny he's dead on. He rarely misses a beat: The timing of his calls is really quick, and I can't count how many times an announcer was an embarrassing five seconds behind. This guy is a hoot. Like I said before, this game has a little bit of fun for everybody in it. The power-ups I didn't like so much, but the actual racing was a heck of a lot of fun. And for pure speed's sake, this game is lightning fast. I wish that instead of creating a power-ups system, the EA development team, had ditched it entirely and focused more on even more clever track designs and more shortcuts and high-flying jumps. That would have been awesome. There was one thing I forgot to mention, and that concerns the AI. When you get up in the middle to late levels, the AI is trecherously mean. They come up from behind and dart into your back side, throwing you into a spin and losing your position. Of course you're capable of doing the same thing, but the fact that a drone is nailing you is cool.For gamers who love fast, arcade-style racing, Nascar Rumble is an excellent game to purchase. It's big, filled with solid courses, and presents a lot of challenge. I would love to see this game come to the PlayStation2. I can't even imagine how cool that would be.", "date": "Feb 8, 2000"}
