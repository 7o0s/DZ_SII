Few people will remember the game Deja Vu, which was released on the ancient NES eons ago.  Regardless, you can now own two adventures in one game pak, Deja Vu 1 & 2:  The Casebooks of Ace Harding, which includes the private detective's first case and the sequel on one cartridge.  Features Two different adventures 140 different locations Battery-backed save Only For Game Boy Color  Unlike Shadowgate Classic, also available on Game Boy Color, your chances of being glued to this game are pretty slim.  No matter which adventure you play, you begin with odds that are definitely not in your favor.  In the first case, you awaken in a bathroom stall with a dazed head, a pounding headache, and a case of amnesia.  How convenient!  From here, you collect your belongings and explore the inside of Joe's Restaurant, where you discover the dead body of Joey Siegel, whose murder is now on your hands.  Just your luck.  Somebody's pinned the crime on you, and you have to do whatever it takes to clear your name of these unfair accusations.  In the second case, it's an entirely different story.  Ace has just solved the first game's mystery, but before he can get a little rest away from the scene, he's been gumshoe-napped by mob boss Anthony Malone.  Why?  Because Joey Siegel owed Anthony $112,000.  Since Siegel's murder, Mr. Malone's dough has been missing, and he suspects that Ace knows of its whereabouts.  After all, he was the last one to be seen with Siegel's body.  Thus beings the sequel.  Under the close watch of Stogie Martin, you're given exactly one week to recover the money and hand it back.  If you can't do it, it's curtains for you.  Both cases have the exact same navigating scheme.  To perform any actions, just use the corresponding icons at the bottom of the screen:  The eyeball represents examining, the wrench represents using, the hand represents taking, the open door represents opening, the closed door represents closing, the lips represent speaking, the fist represents hitting, the trash can represents dropping items, and the foot represents moving.  It's not exactly rocket science, but using these actions in odd combinations can have some interesting effects.  Your inventory is also easy to navigate.  Scroll through a list of your items, then select whichever one you want to look at or use. Go back to the main screen and do what you want with it.  It's as simple as that.  While on the main screen, you'll have a cursor to move around.  Point it at whatever you want and click, and something will happen, depending on what action you have selected.  Things get confusing right off the bat in both of the game's cases.  You're on your own to accomplish some ultimate goal;  before you can do that, you have to add items to your inventory, and a whole bunch of them at that.  What you will use all of these objects on is a mystery in itself, and you're left clueless about what they do.  Until you get lucky and use the right thing during the right situation, you're bound to be confused.  This type of game doesn't really take smarts -- it takes dumb luck and minor observations.  All in all, Deja Vu 1 & 2 is pretty bland.  The drab graphics and lack of animation add to its poor visual ambience.  The characters are just like the typical mobsters you've seen through years of cartoons and old sitcoms, except these ones aren't interesting.  The game's objectives include basically the following:  look around rooms, pick up items, find important things like keys, then use them.  It's not a whole lot more complex than that.  Sometimes when your game ends, the reason is so stupid that it's laughable.  If you don't pay a taxi driver, you'll get sent to jail.  Crocodiles can eat you in the sewers.  Trains can run you over.  I liked Deja Vu the first time around -- when it was called Shadowgate Classic.  There was a level of enjoyment in that game that made it fun to play.  When a puzzle was beaten, it felt satisfying.  When a foe was vanquished, it felt rewarding.  I can't say the same about this game.  It does have its high points, though.  The casino in the second case isn't too bad, and some of the areas elsewhere are a little interesting.  One thing I'm thankful for is that there's no time limit -- you don't have to roam buildings to find items that buy you a little more time.  All you have to do is keep away from death while you're hopping trains, searching cities, and finding loot.  It'll take luck, though.  I didn't like Deja Vu 1 & 2 too much from the start.  Perhaps it was the whole common ~private detective~ thing that bored me to death, or maybe it was just the lack of fun.  Nah, both.  If I want a game like Shadowgate, I'll stick with Shadowgate.  Sure, you'll get two games in one if you buy this, but neither is really worth the buy.", "date": "Jun 14, 2000"}
