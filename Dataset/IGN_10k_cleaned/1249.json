Pac-Man, in general, is majorly responsible for the reason why videogames are so damn popular today.  About two decades ago, Namco had a humongous arcade hit on its hands, and it's since evolved into literally dozens of other games.  It's a good thing that the sequels and spin-offs of the Pac-Man franchise have, for the most part, retained the same great gameplay as the original.  Like last year's ~Pac Man World 20th Anniversary,~ Ms Pac Man: Maze Madness is loads of fun and stays true to the series that the world has come to love.   Gameplay It's never been anything but dots, dots, dots.  Run around a maze, eat the dots, go to a new maze, repeat.  This same style of play has been revived in the third dimension with changes that appeal to today's gaming generation, and you know what?  It's as good as ever.  In addition to the four ghosts, Inky, Pinky, Blinky, and Sue, there are other nasty enemies in each level to stop you from proceeding to the next area.  In the first world, for example, there are anubis-type baddies who throw magic at you.  Mummies, caterpillars, and other foes will also attempt to put you away.    Levels are designed more like a platform game than like a Pac-Man game.  Although everything is composed of polygons, it feels right at home with the two-dimensional hits of our past.  You cannot freely move about the levels in any direction you choose.  Instead, you're restricted to moving up, down, left, and right, just like the old days.  However, you're not restricted to just one small maze any more, and your main objective isn't to just rack up points.    In fact, you're on a mission to recover the four Gems of Virtue from each of the four worlds in Pac-Land.  Someone wicked has claimed the Enchanted Castle and turned it into a haunted house.  In addition to this, the Princess is missing!  In order to return peace to the world, Ms. Pac Man will have to find each of the gems and stop the evil behind all the tyranny.  Sound corny?  Give it a break, it's a kid's game, and a hell of a lot of fun at that.   The best part about Ms. Pac Man:  Maze Madness is that it is very simple.  Instead of trying to rebuild an old game with complex, pointless elements, Namco keeps the basics and improves upon them.  In each level, there are hundreds of dots for you to eat.  The levels are much more vast than ever before, and have puzzles and enemies galore.  If you know how to press the directional buttons on the PlayStation controller, you know how to play this game.  To push a block, you move next to it and press the button in the direction you want it to go.  To defeat enemies, eat a Power Pellet and run into them.  All other buttons, for the most part, have non-existent functions during levels.   Other things have been added to the Ms. Pac-Man universe, such as keys, jumping blocks, speed chutes, moving blocks, TNT crates, and more.  If these additions worry you, fret not.  It's just as fun as ever, if not more so.  Now, instead of just running around and avoiding ghosts, you use the objects in your area to make it on to the next section.  Many puzzles require you to push blocks in the right places, whereas others make you walk across buttons in the correct order.  There aren't many taxing puzzles in the game, but some can make you stop to think for a moment.   Where's the fruit, though?  Oh, it's in there, all right;  it doesn't dance across the screen these days, though.  The more of it that you collect, the more bonus points you earn.  In order to pick up these delicious pieces of tropical -- and not so tropical (pretzel, anyone?) -- fruit, certain tasks have to be accomplished.  For example, some pieces of fruit hide behind blocks or doors.  To get to them, you have to either destroy or unlock them.  Other obstacles are even more difficult to overcome, such as getting floating fruit.   In order to progress on to new stages, a player has to collect a certain number of Golden Stars.  To get a Golden Star, Ms. Pac Man will have to either complete a stage, eat all seven pieces of fruit, eat every last Pac Dot, or finish the level within a certain amount of time.  For each one of these objectives that you complete, you earn a star.  Finding all of the Pac Dots and fruit can be difficult until you find the Witch Key, which unlocks secret doors in all of the levels.   The time trial is one of the better versions I've seen in video games lately.  When this has been activated, you have a certain amount of time to finish a level.  This is when you want to speed past everything, collecting as little as you possibly can along the way.  If you get hit by an enemy, time is subtracted from the clock.  If you are able to grab a clock power-up, 10 seconds will be added.  If Ms. Pac Man touches the flying witch's hat, she will be slowed down for a while.  This mode is actually a lot of fun.   What game, nowadays, would be complete without a multi-player match?  Ms. Pac Man's could be a little bit better, but it's enjoyable anyway.  Up to four players can join in.  Once each has chosen his or her character, there are a few multiplayer match versions to pick from:  Dot Mania, Ghost Tag, and Da Bomb.  In Dot Mania, everyone runs around frantically, trying to collect the most dots.  The player who gets 80 before everyone else is the winner.  During this mode, there are power-ups which give super powers, like lightning blasts and fire trails.  Da Bomb is really fun.  At the beginning of the match, a random player is ~the bomb,~ and has 30 seconds before he or she explodes.  If that player touches someone else, he/she will become the bomb.  Once a bomb blows up, someone else is randomly chosen.  When there is only one player left, that person is the winner.   For those of you nostalgic people, the original version of Ms. Pac Man has been included.  That's right!  Not only can you go around the world in 3D, but you can also revisit the classic that made this game possible.  It doesn't get much better than this!   Graphics I honestly didn't expect something this good.  I've seen better, but as far as a Pac-Man game goes, this is perfect.  The polygons are designed well and are all very colorful.  Like the gameplay, the graphics have been altered, but not so much to the point that they look entirely different from what was available 20 years ago.  Although 3D, everything plays like it's 2D, and it works out in the game's favor.   Each maze is designed to look like a specific area of the earth.  For example, the first set of mazes is set in an Egyptian scenario.  Tombs, caskets, magic carpets, pyramids, and other such things decorate the levels to give the appropriate appearance.  The second set of levels is very icy.  Here, there are snow boulders, ice spots, and other obstacles which are located within caverns.  The special effects aren't too shabby, either.  Flames, a few lighting effects, lightning, etc, can be found here and there.   Sound Remember '80s music?  Cindi Lauper, Duran Duran?  The music in Ms. Pac Man:  Maze Madness sounds like it was ripped from a decade and a half ago, but it's surprisingly really good!  The ~Egyptian~ theme, which sings throughout the first few stages, can get stuck in your head if you're not careful.  The sound effects are right-on, too.  The explosions, plinks, and other noises all sound good.  Although the full-motion video itself is crappy, the voice acting is very...~enthusiastic.~  When you talk to Professor Pac during the game itself, his voice is like the characters in Banjo Kazooie on Nintendo 64.  This is a great game!  Like the old Pac-Man adventures I've played, this is addictive and all too enjoyable.  The conversion that Ms. Pac Man has made from the old arcade to PlayStation is excellent.  Not only does it retain the spirit from the infamous classics, but it also makes some creative improvements.  Just in case you get tired of running around the 3D stages for some mindless Pac Dot-eating action, the original version is there to set things straight.  Great job, Namco.
