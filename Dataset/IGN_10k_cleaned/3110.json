And although this game boasts a lot of new features compared to last year's version, TP99 just doesn't feel like a brand new game.  Triple Play 99 is a good quick fix for those who love baseball games. It's probably one of the only baseball titles out there where you don't have to read the instruction booklet -- it's a perfect game for those who've never played a baseball title before. On the other hand, a simple pitch and hit interface makes baseball on the PlayStation a little dull and probably won't excite most hard-core baseball fans.  Now EA Sports has added a lot of new features that have improved the Triple Play franchise. One in particular would be the improved game cameras. Imagine watching Mo Vaughn up to bat, he hits a line drive between second and third base. When the third baseman grabs the ball and throws to first, the camera shifts behind the first baseman and flawlessly recreates just one of the acts that you would see in real game. Pardon the small tangent, but the camera angles add a lot of needed excitement when compared to last year's run.   Unfortunately, most of the changes in the game were cosmetic. Sure, the stadiums look nice, the players look a little better, and the dual announcers are a crackup. Look past all that, EA Sports needs to change the gameplay. The game looks nice, but TP99 is too basic. Simply judging by how fast a ball is coming in to the catcher isn't enough. It would be nice to see EA Sports add a some crazy curve balls and even some high and low swinging action. This way, hitting a ball would be more of a challenge.  There's no question that Triple Play 99 is one of the best looking baseball games on the market. However, the lack of in-depth gameplay still makes TP99 a little redundant. If you haven't picked up a baseball game, and you're new to baseball titles, Triple Play 99 is a good choice.  Jason Boor", "date": "Mar 11, 1998"}
