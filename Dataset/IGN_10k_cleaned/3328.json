Some gamers are plenty happy pushing blocks, collecting monsters and choosing ~attack~ from a menu all their lives, but I start to spasm with a jonezing if I'm left without an action game for too long. And, so far, the Game Boy Advance has left me to sweat through my fit. This system hasn't yet purged me of my need for bullets and explosions,  and thank the Lloyd that somebody -- possibly the most unlikely somebody in the business -- came along with a game that got my blood going again.   Features  Customize four car types with your choice of weapons, engine, overdrive and more Link up four players for arena combat with saved cars or preset designs Battery save for one player to save his quest and multiple car creations Only for Game Boy Advance   From the people who brought you Harvest Moon comes an RPG with as many  bullets flying as Doom. Natsume (in conjunction with its oversees partner Victor Interactive) has always carved out a unique niche, so the idea of a game like Harvest Moon with explosive auto destruction in the place of simple farm living may not be so strange. It certainly worked for me -- even if you don't care for RPGs at all, Car Battler Joe has enough heavy action to burn away any fears over the big-eyed characters and hyper-cute storytelling. This is an RPG set to my speed, right down to the overworld's ~run~ button!  For a second, let's say screw the RPG shell and concentrate on the meat of the game: the car battling. It's a very good Twisted Metal clone on the handheld, with plenty of weapons and technique to utilize, though still not quite enough to always satisfy my desire for a tight, technical car combat game (come on, Activision -- give us V8 or give us death ... or a different car battle game, either one of the three.) The developer Ancient (new to the GBA, but made of industry vets of Actraiser and other classics) got the underlying control scheme just about right, from the needed ability to drive backwards to the power-sliding steering. My only complaint is that the car still fishtails as if it's sliding if you have the wheels turned even when you come to a dead stop and then gas it again. That aside, it moves well, and the Mode 7-style top-down (actually more of a 3/4 angle) engine really adds a visceral quality to keep the screen always alive and active. If you missed the top-down stages in Contra Advance like I did, the spin-dizzy worlds of this game will set you whirling again.  What Car Battler Joe lacks in precision destruction, it makes up for with customization. You can build the heck out of the cars in this game -- stick on multiple weapons, crank up some Overdrive features, tweak the engine and chassis, even downgrade working parts ... it's up to you. The machines you build aren't always a day-and-night difference from what you started with -- the flying machines still steer a lot like cars -- but auto nuts and carnage connoisseurs will have a field day opening up the hood. You can also add Overdrive mods to the cars for special moves like a jump, dash or shield. All of this comes at an impressive economy of buttons in battle -- despite having four active guns on-board and three Overdrive mods active, the gameplay is still only controlled by two action buttons plus the gas pedal (and that's not counting the ability to eject spare junk out of your cargo just to shine on a trailing baddie.) The innovative trigger button system takes a bit to get used to (and a bit longer since it's not explained well in the manual), but once you get that you choose your weapons by engaging it in relation to the distance to your enemy, it works pretty well (for instance, the saw engages when a baddie is inches away, the long-range bombs when a foe is ahead and off-screen). There are issues -- the balance of strength and accuracy just isn't there for long-range weapons to be any good (stick with mid- and close-range weapons), and the game could use some side-firing weapons in addition to the forward and backward blasts. Even so, it whips in the heat of battle, and there's always new technique to explore in battle if you're adventurous.     Too bad the open-ended quality of the mod system didn't stretch to the story. As far as the RPG sections go, it's strictly linear (broken up mess of tasks to take up and play with your car when you don't feel like progressing) and none too deep, but it's dang cute and runs without any drag. The game is set in a bizarre land where cars are ancient relics revered by the population who now subside on these treasured mobiles. People are obsessed with car battling and gun vehicles: their heroes are car battle greats, their livelihoods are solely dependent on the business behind the gladitorial sport and the side-jobs available to friendly car battlers when not in combat, and their future dreams are to someday pilot their own gun vehicle. An RPG convention, sure, but it's still odd how these characters live and breathe car battling and nothing else -- one sequence has all of the local tournament's judges get offed, and suddenly the town is in a panic that they'll NEVER be able to hold another tournament without them. (It's a single-minded world that may be familiar to you if you've ever visited a GameCube message board...)  The main section of the game doesn't use the Mode-7ish engine, but it's still visually a cut above the average GBA RPG. Characters are huge on-screen, with big heads that are designed for lots of facial expression (there's not a ton of animation outside of the canned head-nods and jumping characters with exclamation marks, but it works in an old-school manner.) The drab color schemes of the battle engine doesn't mesh perfectly with the colorful (but still subdued) main worlds, but then again, those stages get some serious movement going on. The biggest quirk that I found with the aesthetics is that the sprite engine for the cars on the road does a strange perspective-correction trick that make all the cars look like motorcycles when far away. As for the audio, the sound engine is also not always up to the task that the designers are putting it up against. It's a full GBA orchestra composition -- very welcome against the 8-bit beeps we usually get on this system -- and the sound effects of ricocheting bullets and revving engines mesh well with the music tracks. However, the sound quality is too hollow over headphones. Just stick with the standard speakers. Also, the music just isn't so memorable when you realize that this is coming from a studio featuring the great Yuzo Koshiro and staffed with Actraiser and SOR people. Still, I appreciate the variety of the music, which stretches from big and brassy A-Team romps to pleasant tinkling overworld elevator music, and the team did go out of its way to do multiple battle themes and even a few unique songs for special conversations.   A few tweaks would have made this an easy choice at any score for our IGN Editor's Choice collection -- there's just not enough variety in the missions to push it into the upper echelons, and the cool multiplayer mode may be moot since you'll probably never find another gamer who owns this one -- but Car Battler Joe is the one I keep coming back to, for short romps as well as extended customization sessions. As a dedicated car battling game, it's just a few lengths short of the big score: give me a better variety of arena maps with danger zones and distinctive features more like Super Mario Kart instead of the basic sprawls we've got here and I'm sold. And as a dedicated RPG, it's no FF. But sandwich the two together and you've got a short-burst game that you can play for a long, long time.", "date": "Dec 13, 2002"}
