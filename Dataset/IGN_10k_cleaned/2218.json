You may be able to watch Bella Legosi or Brad Pitt sucking the blood from innocent victim's necks in the movies, or read about the new cult of goth-inspired vampire in graphic novels, but you can't get a hold of some good Legacy of Kain madness unless you play videogames.   From the beginning of the series, Crystal Dynamics' focus on story and character development has remained one of its strongest draws, while the gameplay and graphics have changed and grown according to the platforms for which they've been programmed. Eidos' and Crystal Dynamics' latest chapter in its ongoing vampire franchise, Soul Reaver 2, brings gamers deep within a tribe of vampires whose twisted world is rich with the kinds of things that make up great opera and daytime TV -- betrayal, death, murder, and power struggles galore.   The Ongoing Story  Soul Reaver 2 is the semi-conclusive sequel to the Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver branch of the series that follows Raziel and his quest for truth in the mired, divided world of Nosgoth. This chapter is a respectable, good-looking title that will please fans of the series, adventure lovers, and is very likely to draw in a substantial new crowd of gamers. Players don't necessarily need to have played the previous games in the series, since nearly everything is explained though dialog, but it does help -- a lot, actually -- if you're already familiar with the series. I won't even begin to tell the whole story, but just know this, in Soul Reaver 2, Raziel gets an education about the history of Nosgoth, and learns how he plays a part in the destruction and savior of it as well.   Raziel's adventure enables players to unravel the real shift of power from the Guardians of the Pillars to Kain himself, and the ongoing power struggle between the Moebius, Kain and Raziel himself. The story answers many questions posed in Soul Reaver 1, but it poses new ones that inevitably aren't answered in this game, questions that seem obviously left open for another a sequel to answer. In short, several characters are revealed, plotlines play out in both the past and the future, and it's all quite good fun. But you never feel like you've received the full, complete, definitive story, and that's genuinely part of Crystal D's plan, whether you like it or not.    The story in Soul Reaver 2 is elaborate, to say the least, and at times, it's vexing and muddled. The shifting of time and purposely questionable narrators -- Kain and Moebios -- draw what seems like a rather simple story about a power struggle into a epic, Shogun-length series of events that never end. I believe that part of this is consciously done, while other parts are not so consciously done.   But I did reach a breaking point, where I felt the story was a bit overdone, even pretentious. While I desperately wanted to know what happens to Raziel and Kain and the fate of the Pillars and humankind (see what I'm saying? Nothing in the Kain series is light), Soul Reaver 2 does wear on one at times, both in gameplay and in the story itself. Sometimes I enjoyed the lavish dialog, other times I just couldn't handle it. (I grew weary of the dialect, and my soul ached for the melancholy days of yore, and yet my patience withered like the flaky skin of a vampire victim on his dying bed, but still I yearned for the undulant knowledge that my game would eventually, inevitably, conceivably end, perhaps, if only, somehow, maybe, Kain would just strike the final deadly note we'd all singularly been waiting for.) The dialog does indeed reach these levels of haughtiness.   Yes, it's true, the sense of weighty issues -- the fate of humanity and of all vampires -- always has played a big part of the Kain series. But isn't there something to be said for good, even measure? Often, I just wanted a straight answer, or even a plain sentence. Simple language is good language. But Kain and Raziel's overwritten text makes them sound like caffeine-imbued English students verbally jousting in their first semester in college (and I know what they sound like, 'cause I was one). In any case, if you play Soul Reaver 2, you will receive a lot of story, language, and then some. It's rich and it's good, but much of it is overdone.   Gameplay  In most respects, Soul Reaver 2 plays exactly like Soul Reaver 1. Shown from a third-person perspective, Soul Reaver 2 evenly divides into equal parts combat, story, and puzzle solving. But while the game feels almost exactly like the first Soul Reaver at first, almost every single area of the game has received dramatic improvement, tuning, and balance. The game plays out for about about 15-20 hours, a good long time for most gamers, and little of that is getting lost of retreading steps unnecessarily.   Once you've played through it, there isn't much replay value left, even if it's gripping during playtime. However, Crystal Dynamics offers players all sorts of DVD extras, including still art, renders, the History of Nosgoth in text, a great new preview of Blood Omen 2, and funny, voice outtakes that provide gamers with the human faces to the voices played in the game.  Let's start with the new puzzles. If you played the first Soul Reaver then you're probably quite familiar with the block puzzles. The game boasted several likeable, clever puzzles involving the correct placement of moving blocks to open doors, etc. And then there were what seemed like dozens more, and it all got quite out of hand. Well, that's old hat, now. Soul Reaver 2 has evolved, and the new physical puzzles play on light, shadow, color combinations and a little bit of logic. There aren't as many small puzzles in the game as there were before, instead they're bigger, multi-part, moderately complex, and diverse.   I don't want to give too much away, but here's an example. The first puzzle enables players to gain the Dark Reaver power. The puzzle is found on the far side of the Swamps, and leads Raziel through what boils down to about three major rooms. In each, a series of moveable mirrors can be manipulated to connect sunlight through to secondary mirrors, or mirrors can be found and placed to connect the light to complete the puzzle. Each time another part of the big puzzle is connected, players see a cut-scene showing their progress and the result of their efforts. In one room, Raziel must use the Soul Reaver to project a beam onto the ceiling to open up a new passageway. In several puzzles throughout the game, wall murals and well-edited, foreshadowing cutscenes lay out the aim of each puzzle. The Light Reaver puzzle appears in an Egyptian-style structure, and the third major puzzle takes place in a huge structure with what appears to be dozens of rooms. To say the least, the puzzles are well balanced, varied, and far improved over SR1.   I noticed something about this game that I like far better than in SR1. With the exception of the over-written language, the game is well balanced in all respects. The spaces between enemies are balanced, and the way in which they attack in groups isn't overbearing. Also, switching to and from the Real world to the Ethereal world was not intimidating. I always felt that I was in trouble when I switched to the Ethereal world in SR1, that I would die too quickly. But here, while the game was still a little intimidating at first, the puzzles and the control over all aspects, from game flow to simple additions (such as a map and a compass), make this game much more manageable. During my 20 hours of play I literally died once, meaning that only once did I have to restart from a checkpoint.   The game is much easier to move around in than Soul Reaver 1. The map and compass were much-needed elements, and it's amazing how little things such as these increase the pleasure of an adventure game. You can check the map; it shows you where Raziel is, and where he needs to be. It doesn't give everything away, but it does point to a desired section of the map, and it's very useful and helpful. And the compass; it's another obvious addition that helps to complete the game.   What I particularly liked about Soul Reaver 2 are the improvements to the combat system. The basic fighting stuff still exists from SR1. Players can jump, hover, swipe, walk, run, crawl, swim, pick up and use or throw weapons, but they also can do more complex things, too. Raziel and his opponents perform special moves, combinations, and finishing moves. The finishers are rather simple and look a little off-kilter at times (collision detection stuff and odd height differencials, for instance), but the final effect is satisfying. You dust an opponent and then reach in and pull out his heart, or you lop off his head, or you cleave him in half. It's all good.   That's only half of it. Crystal has implemented a sweet and subtle targeting system, along with a great counter and strafe system. Press R1 and watch as Raziel targets an enemy, who then glimmers with light for a second to indicate he's your target, and under which a thin red circle appears. Let go of R1 and you can refocus on any other target. While targeted, Raziel can dodge and strafe quickly and effectively, and he can dodge large, fast enemies in this way and zip behind them to lay down all kinds of lovely damage. This simple system makes combat in Soul Reaver 2 so much better that in SR1 it put a smile on my face all the way to the end of the game.   Players can still use weapons like they did in SR1. Weapons can be picked off the ground, pulled off walls, and snagged from dead enemies. The Soul Reaver itself is with you at all times, and it's definitely the most powerful weapon in the game. But now it does something different: It overheats with too much use, and when it overheats it draws energy from your health spiral. The Reaver plays a major part in this chapter of Raziel's life, becoming imbued with Light, Dark, Wind, and Fire...and then there's something special at the end with regard to the Reaver that would simply spoil things.   The game encourages players to use a wide variety of weapons, including Raziel's own built-in weapons, his claws and feet. And come to think of it, Raziel is quite powerful. He delivers the standard hits and combos, but now along with finishers, he's got a powerful kick that, when mixed up in combat, confuses the enemy readily.   As for level design and sense of adventure, Soul Reaver 2 is a big game, populated by a good amount of enemies and weapons, but it's relatively bare otherwise. Collecting and such has never been a part of the series, but there is essentially no collecting of power-ups (although the Reaver does get technically upgraded), and there aren't a lot of hidden things worth searching out. This creates a kind of empty feeling in the large, linear rail-like passages, which must be re-tread a handful of times. The way it seems that Crystal Dynamics handled this is by changing the backgrounds wiht rain, snow, and various colors of the seasons, and also by opening up new areas and closing down others in the different time zones.   Graphics  Soul Reaver 2, like Soul Reaver before it, boasts an abundance of gorgeous CG and lots (and I mean lots) of excellent in-game cutscenes. Just like the stunning introduction of Raziel in SR1, the beginning sequence of SR2 is long, telling, and beautiful to the eye. Since the series is story-driven, the cut-scenes are a constant, popping into place in each new area, cutting in to tell new parts of the story, and to point out helpful hints for your next mission.   Raziel and his crew got the high-end treatment when it comes to character detail. Each character comprises a polygon count of about 3,000 polys, and the high-resolution image, along with a 60 frame-per-second movement creates striking, visceral imagery that's far more enhanced than its PlayStation 1 brethren. Raziel looks magnificently decripid, while Kain looks flamboyant and aloof, and the details of their body, their moving eyes and mouths, and their expressionistic movements, are all fantastically done.  The game delivers a special treatment of particles and light effects. Light plays a huge role in the game, from its use in puzzle design to the way it pours through stain-glassed windows to the way it reflects off rivers and streams. And then there are the wonderful little fireflies that buzz about the Pillars and Swamp areas. They look great. The Light Reaver, in all its forms, looks stellar, too, especially the Fire Reaver (in my humble opinion). The game is still very dark in its overall palette but then again, it's depicting a dark time, and we are talking about vampires, right? There's nothing terribly light about them.   Graphically, Soul Reaver 2 is a good-looking game, and compared to a handful of some of the best looking games on PS2, it definitely holds its own. It's not stunning looking, like say GT3 or Devil May Cry, but with the abundance of light particles, deep backgrounds (especially the wonderfully horrific Elder God), and respectable variation of textures, it's darn pretty.   Sound  The folks behind Soul Reaver know their music and sound. While the music is atmospheric in dark, ominous and even creepy, it's the voice acting that's truly top notch.   With professional actors that spotlight the return cast of Michael Bell (Raziel), Tony Jay (the Elder God), Simon Templeman (Kain), and who are joined by Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's Rene Auberjonis (Aerial), the excellent voice-acting is only slightly weakened by the game's overly haughty language. However one looks at it, in comparison to other most videogames, Soul Reaver 2's overall sound quality is outstanding. Overall, Soul Reaver 2 is a remarkably sound game. It's well rounded, it's improved in marked areas over its predecessor (The Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver), and the graphics, sound, and production levels are all high. The game delivers a huge portion of Raziel's and Kain's story to the reader, and it answers many questions that immodestly hung over Crystal Dynamic's head after the first Soul Reaver. I felt far more rewarded when I finished this game than when I did Soul Reaver 1. There was enough to bit into and enough given up that I didn't feel empty. With this game, players will find out how dozens of elements in the Kain universe fit together, and Raziel himself is fleshed out with a more likeable personality, showing more aggressiveness, wit, and balance than before. Indeed even Kain is put in a more favorable light, making him strangely more...well, human. I had a good time playing Soul Reaver, but I learned things about the series that I never really gave much notice to before, and that I'm not fond of. First, I realized that people, and sometimes even vampires (and even former vampires), should occasionally use plain English in conversations. Later in the game, the language tones down a wee bit, and some witty language and quick and smart converstions occur. But still, a little Nosgothian tongue goes a long way. Second, I realized that at least in Soul Reaver 2, the backtracking never seemed overly heavy (I think I had to retread the same roads about five times), but while moving from place to place I noticed how bare the environments were. With the exception of the underwater sections, there is very little exploration to be done, and there is almost no need to return to any location for curiosity's sake. The scenery changes, the seasons change, and new Elemental Fonts open up, but the route is kind of bare. Last, I realized that the Legacy of Kain series is a strangely attractive, yet equally obscure one that has me torn between loving and hating it. I'm sure that's the very nature or vampire stories that make them attractive, too, but Kain and Raziel's stories are more so, and it boils down to their actions being so damn important, to them being so self-indulgent in their own minds, that it's a little tiring. Still, I want more from the game (more exploration, things to do and see), and yet I'm caught in the realization that Soul Reaver 2 is just a very, very good exercise in perfecting the elements introduced in Soul Reaver 1.", "date": "Nov 3, 2001"}
