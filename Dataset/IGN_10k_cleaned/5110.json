{"name": "Xenogears", "name_review": "Xenogears", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/21/xenogears", "text": "When Squaresoft first announced from its Japanese offices that the latest RPG in development, Xenogears, might not make it to US shores due to ~sensitive religious issues,~ many RPG fans in North America were shaken. But during the following months, a reversal in the company's plans and a joint partnership with Electronic Arts has enabled the North American release of Xenogears to finally become a reality. And how lucky we are because of it.  The game chronicles the adventures of a young reluctant warrior named Fei, who, after three years of residing in a small, remote farming village begins a long, tortuous quest to uncover his mysterious past. With no memory of his life before being placed in the village leader's care three years earlier, Fei makes a violent and tragic break with his peaceful life and sets out upon a journey. Along the way, not only will his own past be discovered, but he'll also unravel the mystery of the planet's past and humanity's role in relation to it. The storyline is deep, complex, and once in a while even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered. To reveal more of the storyline would ruin it for potential players, and the progression of Fei's quest is a lot like a mystery for the player to follow and solve on their own.   The game itself is constructed in the traditional turn-based RPG style but with several innovative features that make it stand miles apart from its predecessors.  The combat system utilizes some of the same aspects of a typical Square game by incorporating the Active Time Gauge system that dictates when a character in your party may attack the enemy, depending on his or her (or its) speed and agility. However, in addition to this battle feature, Square also has implemented a unique combo attack system that enables your character to string together a series of different physical attacks dependent upon how many AP points you have accumulated and can use. For instance, each of the symbol buttons on the PlayStation controller correspond to a different attack that inflicts a varying degree of damage. The more damage an attack causes, the higher amount of AP is used. If you ~power up~ your AP gauge by using only light attacks, you can then unleash a flurry of ~super moves~ that are gradually learned over the course of the game to obliterate the enemy and inflict an extremely high amount of damage. This combo system is, by far, one of the most innovative features to recently emerge in the RPG genre and provides a higher level of interaction in battle beyond using only one attack button.   But the most impressive feature in combat is the ability to use massive ~Gears~ or mechs. The AP system is replaced by Attack Levels that increase by using low-level attacks. As your Attack Level creeps higher, you'll be able to perform special attacks that can be ultimately devastating to the enemy. And the mech enemies are massive! The experience of controlling and fighting in an intricately designed mech against a gigantic boss or sub-boss is probably one of the most visually satisfying combat experiences that you can engage in in a console RPG. And Xenogears has the scale of the fights as well as the momentum of battle drawn and programmed to perfection.   Visually, the game presents a beautiful mix of 16- and 32-bit worlds by rendering all the characters in highly detailed sprites and sets them against a 3D polygonal world. The result is more akin to the gorgeous hand-drawn world of Breath of Fire III than Final Fantasy VII's sometimes awkward pre-rendered environments, but moves at a distinctly faster pace and frame rate that enables your character to jump and run across the terrain. At some points, you'll also have to use skill to navigate certain areas by using your jump and climb abilities. This features adds even more depth to exploration of different environments and distances Xenogears from being too straightforward of a traditional RPG. It feels as if Squaresoft put an incredible amount of thought and effort into making Xenogears as complex and full of variety as it could before releasing the game. And the effort definitely pays off by making the players feel like they have an unlimited amount of freedom in exploring the world within the game; and by giving them the flexibility to experience it in a variety of ways.   But with such an epic adventure, does the game harbor any flaws? Thankfully, the weaknesses are minor in comparison to the overall strengths of the game. Things such as a rotating camera that sometimes makes viewing an area limited and slightly clumsy in tight spaces are easily forgivable since they don't interfere often at all. Some people may also feel that there are too many story-related cinemas and that the plot is too confusing to follow, but immersion is a key factor in Xenogears and the questions you may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game. Beyond these minor gripes, the total experience of Xenogears is definitely something that no RPG fan should miss out on. With an intricate storyline, beautifully designed characters and mechs, and some of the most innovative features in an RPG, you simply can't afford to pass this game up.
