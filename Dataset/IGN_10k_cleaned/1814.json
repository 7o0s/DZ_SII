With it's epic storyline, addicting gameplay, and awe-inspiring musical score, I would easily place it right up there with Deus Ex and Baldur's Gate II as one of the best RPGs of last year. The game certainly scored well, garnering an 8.8 in a time when Diablo II was casting its giant shadow over all fantasy-based PC games.  Now, almost a year later, Black Isle has delivered the expansion pack to Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter. The expansion, well, expands on the original story allowing you to delve deeper into the world of the Ten Towns and the Spine of the World.   Heart of Winter adds five new areas (including a new town), tons of new items and spells, the drop-away interface from Baldur's Gate II, increased resolution settings, new skills for many classes, and a greatly increased experience cap that allows you to take your characters all the way to level thirty.  We've discussed most of the added features in our numerous previews, so the question comes down to, is the expansion worth it? Coming from someone who tore through the original game and completed it with some pretty buff characters, I'd have to give a resounding ~yes~ to that.  One of the big changes, that will either please you or piss you off depending on your play style, is a change to the AI of the beasties that you will do battle with. For example, in the original you could pull one enemy out of the Fog of War and his buddies would just ignore the fact that you were killing their comrade. That little tactic doesn't work so well in Heart of Winter. Pull one dude out of the Fog and the whole army waiting there will follow and pound you into the ground.  The other big change to the game is some restrictions on spells that have been placed due to your character's alignment. While this only really effects evil characters (the game's detailed instruction manual tells you exactly what classes and spells are affected), it can be a real pain if you have a built up character, and all of a sudden you cannot use a spell because you made it evil during the character's creation.  Next up is the cool (no pun intended) Heart of Fury mode. If you want to power level your party up to level thirty, simply open up the game configuration program and check the box for the Heart of Fury mode. While playing in this mode, the enemies will be much more difficult to defeat, yet they will give you a lot of experience once you drop them to the ground. I'd suggest you not try this mode until you complete the expansion one time since by doing that you'll have a little better chance of survival as well...yet it does add replay value to the expansion.  The same quality in the pre-rendered backgrounds that existed in Icewind and Baldur's is still evident with each screen being more detailed than the last. As for the enemies, they are pretty varied, and there are some big nasties that you'll run into, while even some of the smaller ones (such as the popular Wailing Virgins) are cool to look at and have nice spell effects.   As with Icewind Dale, composer Jeremy Soule (he did Total Annihilation, the original Icewind Dale, and most recently Giants among others) has created an excellent score for the game, which once again fits the theme of high adventure perfectly. Just as the town themes in Icewind Dale were excellent, the new town theme here is so good I sometimes found myself simply leaving the characters standing in the center of town to have the music playing while I did something else (the Icewind Dale soundtrack CD is actually spinning in my drive as I write this).   Playing through Heart of Winter reminded me just how enjoyable the original Icewind Dale was and I'm actually tempted to go through the entire series again from the beginning of Icewind Dale through the end of the expansion if I can ever find the time. Heart of Winter achieved the goal that I believe every expansion pack should. It added even more life to an already great game, and I cannot find too much to complain about except the level of difficulty. The expansion is designed for characters who have been built up quite a bit, but there are always ways to get powerful characters.  -- Jeremy Conrad      Want to share your opinions with the world?
