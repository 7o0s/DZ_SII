You see, the game, despite all of its added extras and glitter, was nearly ruined with a handful of serious bugs and AI flaws. That said, IGN64 still rated the game highly as we felt it was still extremely well-executed, offering players the most intuitive batting/pitching system available for any baseball videogame at the time.  This year comes All-Star Baseball 2000, the much anticipated sequel to 1998's  original. Developer Iguana Entertainment has introduced a host of new options, executed a plethora of gameplay tweaks, refined graphics and animation routines and crammed it all into one cartridge. All of the above work to make ASB 2000 the best simulation baseball game we've ever played. However, it's still not perfect...  Features  All 30 Major League teams and over 700 players from the MLBPA. All 30 Major League stadiums 3-D rendered down to the cut of the grass. Scouting reports by New York Yankees All-Star shortstop Derek Jeter. Individual player models feature true-to-life sizes, faces, and team uniforms. Over 400 new motions include over-the-shoulder catches, breaking up double plays, hook slides, swipe tags, and fist pumping player celebrations. All-new player graphics include sunglasses, high socks, and alternate team jerseys, plus rain delays and airborne dust. Over 100 unique batting stances, from the open stance of Andres Gallaraga to Jeff Bagwell's crowding home plate. Authentic home run swings from the games' top sluggers. Advanced artificial intelligence simulates actual player performance in various game conditions: day vs. night, grass vs. turf, and home vs. away. Individual player streaks, slumps, and errors based on real life tendencies. 1,500 play-by-play and color calls by New York Yankee broadcasters John Sterling and Michael Kay. Authentic Major League game sounds for home and away games. On-screen matchup history for every pitcher and batter confrontation. Customized hot & cold strike zones for each Major League Baseball player. Future Throw Technology to turn lightning-quick double-plays. Roster management includes: Multi-player trades; creating, signing and releasing players; and calling up minor league prospects. Option to play the 1999 Major League Baseball schedule or a special 162-game non inter-league season. Ability to track season-long player and team stats in over 300 categories by STATS, Inc. Four game modes: Exhibition, Season, Playoff, and Home Run Derby.   Gameplay Ever play All-Star Baseball '99? If you have, then you've probably got a very good idea of what to expect from the sequel. All-Star Baseball 2000 runs on a variation of last year's game engine and both titles play very similarly. The same hitting/batting system of old is utilized once again, but ASB 2000 expands upon it greatly.   ASB '99: Batting/Pitching mechanic: Batter's swing represented by circle above home plate. Circles were small or large depending on a batter's power and skill. The idea was to align the batter's circle with oncoming pitches to connect with the ball. This process was balanced out by the fact that the pitcher's oncoming throws, represented by another small circle above home plate, were very difficult to hit until the very last second, giving batter's only a brief moment to align their circle and connect with the ball. Pressing B twice resulted in ~power~ hits, but it also decreased the size of a batter's square, thus greatening the chance for strike-outs.  ASB 2000: Very similar process. Hitters' swings are represented by a square placed over the batter's box. Once again, depending on the power and skill of the batter, squares will be larger or smaller. Oncoming pitches are represented by a small circle in the same area. Players can turn off the ball-indicator so that batters can't see it coming until the last second, which we recommend highly as it adds strategy and realism. Again, pressing B twice results in power hits, which lessen a batter's chance of connecting with the ball by decreasing the size of a hit-square.   But it doesn't end there. Now, batters can also position their square in 3D space. By this we mean that it is possible to angle a batter's swing-square so that, if a ball is connected with, it will rocket off into the direction and angle of the 3D square. In other words, it's possible to hit the ball into right field, left field, center, or to first base on purpose  that is, if executed correctly.  If a player is feeling particularly lucky, he can point to his television screen and call his shot and then try to deliver on it. However, we can't guarantee that failure to perform on said prediction will not result in a public flogging by friends.  The newly enhanced batting/pitching mechanic is nothing short of ingenious, and we feel it's nearly reason enough to pick up ASB 2000. Still, it gets better. Batters can now also attempt to predict oncoming pitches. This is done by pressing the Z-button, which then brings up a small sub-menu displaying the available pitches, represented by the camera buttons. If a batter guesses correctly, his hit-square will increase in size, giving him a better chance of connecting with the ball. If he guesses wrong, on the other hand, just the opposite happens: The square decreases in size and the ball is harder to hit. The system works brilliantly and, especially when playing with friends, adds an incredible amount of strategy to the hitting/pitching experience.  Running the diamonds works identically to last year's game. Players advance to the next base using the Z-button and turn back with the R-button. Largely because Iguana's graphics are extremely animation-heavy, ASB 2000's visuals clash with gameplay at times, especially in cases that require quick movements. For example, running looks beautiful, but if a player is sprinting towards third-base and decides that there is no way he can beat an oncoming throw, the process of turning around is often too slow to work for the runner. Another example: A player is caught in a pickle between first and second base. The animation process required for turning around is roughly 1  seconds. Meanwhile the first and second-basemen need only throw the ball to one-another, which requires significantly less animation. Some gamers may find this annoying while others may chalk it up to realism. Personally, we're subscribe to both opinions, if just a little.  Many of last year's reported bugs are thankfully gone with ASB 2000. No longer can players trade monkeys for great players (if they don't want to) and no longer do season statistics jump all over the place. Additionally, it's now possible to trade multiple players for exceptional athletes and the general manger feature is top-of-the-line. If creating full teams is your thing then you've come to the right game.  A few readers have already expressed complaints on the AI side. Examples include the second baseman covering the bag with a runner on second and, in rare cases, the computer pitcher has actually retrieved the ball from the outfield after an error. IGN64 has not, for the record, experienced the latter of the bugs.   Finally, like the original, ASB 2000 is very much a simulation-esque baseball game so don't expect the arcade speed and thrills of a game like Ken Griffey Baseball. Bearing that in mind, Iguana has boosted up the speed of the game considerably. There is almost no lag time now between pitches and everything runs with a bit more umph. In fact, according to project leader Jamie Grieves, if it took 45 minutes to play through a game in ASB '99, it takes 30 for ASB 2000.  Graphics Beautiful. All-Star Baseball '99 looked absolutely fabulous when it debuted for the Nintendo 64 last year and the sequel looks that much better. The game has a very refined, polish appearance to it. Athletes sparkle with realistic movements and tight 3D polygonal model design. Certain motions look so incredibly life-like that players are likely to jump into the game's unsurpassed instant-replay mode just to marvel at them. Slides, for example, comes to life in gorgeous realism; Sometimes, if a player dives into a base too early, athletes will actually scramble to get to the diamond before being tagged out. It's all animated so flawlessly that it may as well be the real thing. That, by the way, is to say nothing of the game's detailed, crisp 640x480 high-resolution graphics. No other baseball game even comes close in terms of visual finesse.   A word of warning however: Framerates, while still very good, benefit significantly from the use of Nintendo's 4MB Expansion Pak. If you don't own one and are interested in ASB 2000, we suggest you immediately shell out the cash for the extra memory. You won't regret it.  Sound Once again, this is largely where the ASB series comes up short. Iguana's sound compression tools and technology are only bettered by those of developer Factor 5 (Rogue Squadron). Why then, are we subjected to what seems like less than 20 select phrases to illustrate every play in the game? Phrases like ~He was way ahead of that pitch,~ tell us that we swung too early, when in fact most of the time we didn't. This would not unforgivable in itself, but coupled with the fact that these lines are repeated over and over again, the whole sound effort just doesn't compare with the rest of the game's ambition. Add in the fact that background sounds are, once again, almost nonexistent save for the steady hum of the crowd and some occasional organ music, and one begins to wonder what Iguana was doing with all of its compression technology. All-Star Baseball 2000 is, in our opinion, the very best baseball experience to be had for Nintendo 64. Admittedly, in many ways the game feels more like a polished, refined version of the original, but in this case that is by no means a bad thing. The enhanced batting/pitching system, enabling for 3D directional ball hitting, is pure genius and no other N64 baseball game has it. The majority of bugs from last year's game have been eliminated and new modes, including a create-a-team option, have been implemented. On the visual front, ASB 2000 is an absolute treat for the eyes; Every player model, 3D stadium and animation routine shines with realism right down to the quality of the high-resolution textures. Even Ken Griffey's Slugfest, a very pretty game in its own right, pales in comparison. We suggest you dive into third-base and then execute the instant replay mode. Your mouth will drop.Unfortunately, this great game is hindered by its lackluster sound efforts, which do little to enhance the feeling that one is actually playing baseball at a ballpark. No PA speaker calls, only occasional crowd boos and cheers, no one-person crowd reactions, limited background music  no personality. Because the sound effects are a bit on the dry side, the overall atmosphere of the game suffers in the end. Come on Iguana! Listen to what Ken Griffey is doing and then copy it. We know you can do it.The only other problem we can find with this stellar game is the fact that it takes more than 120 pages of Memory Pak data to save.Downfalls aside, ASB 2000 delivers in nearly every area and continues to dominate Nintendo 64 as the most polished, best designed baseball game. If you seek a simulation take on America's favorite pastime, then we suggest you run immediately to your nearest retailer and buy this game.", "date": "Apr 10, 1999"}
