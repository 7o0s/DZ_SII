Unfortunately, Micrprose has done an awful job in translating the chopper-sim to the PlayStation.  There are two modes of play in Gunship: a Quick Fire game that enables players to fly their choppers around, blowing up whatever moves, and the Simulation mode, which is much more fun. This mode enables you to create a pilot and fly a variety of missions in Europe and Iraq, piloting everything from the Apache to a UH-60K/L Blackhawk.  There are some decent mission outputs, including selecting the proper weapons configuration, that help give the game some credibility. Ultimately, though, the shoddy graphics and poor handling conspire to make this one forgettable.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
