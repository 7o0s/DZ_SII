After trying to sort it out for about half an hour, it finally occurred to me that I had actually written most of this material before. Over the last year or so, we have written nearly 4000 words about this action/RPG. Every time a new beta has come through the door, it has shut down production for a few days as we try and find new ways to kill each other with new traps, spells and magic items. What does this all mean? First off, I've found an excuse to keep this review fairly short. If you want to get the down and dirty details about the character classes and storyline, just check out our preview which already has all those details. Second, despite the fact that it looks a great deal like several other games that are currently available in game stores, Nox has an addictive quality that is missing in nearly every other game in the genre. Here's a quick look at what makes the game so great and what keeps it from being perfect...  Nox's storyline isn't exactly the most original concept in the world, but the depth with which it is filled out definitely contributes to the game's overall addictive nature. The game's creators have done an excellent job of creating one story that can be told from three different points of view. In this way they've managed to craft one cohesive tale that delivers several different play experiences. Before we get into the differences between the tales though, let's take a quick look at the events that are the same. A couple of generations before the game begins, the land of Nox was torn apart by a great war. The Warriors of Dun Mir, the Wizards of Galava and the Conjurors of Ix banded together to take back the land from the evil Necromancers who had ruled with their eerie powers. Jandor, the warrior who led the righteous army of the south into battle had uncovered the Staff of Oblivion, a weapon of such unspeakable power that even the undead armies of the Necromancers were unable to stand against it. When the dust had cleared, the Southern armies had killed off every member of the Necromancers' evil bloodline except one  a small infant named Hecubah. Jandor, tired of the killing and slaughter of the past few years couldn't bring himself to slay so defenseless an opponent and so he let her go, a mistake that any of us who have any experience with movie sequels wouldn't have made. After the battle was over, the very different powers of Ix, Dun Mir and Galava began to grow mistrustful of the power that Jandor wielded in the Staff of Oblivion. In an attempt to keep the peace, Jandor disassembled the device into three parts and gave them to the leaders of the three towns, As the years past though, the three villages grew further and further apart from each other, preferring to deal with other people of their own kind rather than deal with the increasingly exotic powers of the other cities.  This is where you come in. Your character is sucked in through a dimensional portal that just happened to be located in your TV (if video games have taught me anything, it's that TVs make exceptional dimensional portals) and winds up in front of the Airship Captain, a mysterious figure who watches out for the land of Nox. Depending on which class you picked at the beginning of the game, Warrior, Conjuror or Wizard, you'll be introduced to the tale of Hecuba and her undead army from one of three different points. While each journey will take you through the same locations, the way you get there and the powers that you have at your command are completely different. Each of the different tales are riveting despite the fact (or perhaps because of the fact) that they never take themselves entirely seriously. No matter how you go about the game though, you'll always have to duke it out with Hecubah and her minions at some point... and that's a lot harder than you might think. Each different path available in the single player mode features fantastic levels that are exceptionally well designed and that offer an excellent balance of fighting and puzzle solving (for those of you out there who are concerned about such things, it leans more towards action). Every now and then the dungeon/cavern exploration is broken up by the appearance of a super powerful 'boss' character that will usually force you to reload your game a few times until you figure out how to beat him. If there is any weak point in Nox's play movement it's in these characters  they're often a great deal harder to beat than anything else, so after you defeat them, going back to killing simple monsters again seems a little mundane. They also show up fairly soon in the game and may frustrate players who are still learning the ropes...  Nox' play interface takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you'll probably be disappointed by anything else. To move your character around the screen, you simply drag your mouse pointer in any direction away from your character and hit the right mouse button. If you hold the mouse far away from your character, he'll run. If you keep it nearby he'll walk, a useful option if you're trying to wind your way through a dungeon full of lethal traps. While each class has different abilities available to them, they all use them in pretty much the same way. The 'A', 'S', 'D', 'F' and 'G' keys can all be mapped with different spells or natural abilities. You can build up to five of these different keyboard layouts that you can switch between pretty quickly. Most players will opt to lay them out as I did, with all of their light combat spells on one setting, all of their heavy combat spells on another, all of their movement and control spells on a third and so on. Steve took a completely different tack with the game, preparing for situations rather than spell groupings. His 'Tough Area' setting, for example, combined a Lightning Spell for dealing with lots of enemies, a Fireball spell for powerful single enemies, a Heal spell to help out in a pinch, and Confuse and Slow to give him ample time to get away from those enemies he couldn't defeat. While I'd love to tell you that my setup is superior, the fact that Steve kicked my ass nearly every time I stepped into a game says a lot for his layout. My advice is to sort it out for yourself. Other items that you'll need access to quickly are also easy to reach on the keyboard. Health Potions can automatically be used by hitting the 'X' key, Mana Potions by hitting the 'C' and pressing 'Z' will use any Cure Poison potions you have in your inventory. You can also switch between a primary and a secondary weapon (a hand weapon and a missile weapon for example) by hitting 'V'.  This layout is so amazingly easy to use that it takes a great deal of the frustration of multi-item inventories out of the game and opens up new areas of strategy in multiplayer that I've never seen before. It used to be that all having a lot of health potions meant is that you could fix a lot of damage after a battle. But since it took so long to get to your potions, they didn't really play all that important a role during a fight. In Nox, on the other hand, you have to weigh in the fact that your enemy may be carting around a boatload of potions. Even if you have a slightly more powerful weapon, his ability to constantly heal himself will eventually put you at a serious disadvantage.  Which brings us to multiplayer. Nox's network mode is one of the most entertaining play experiences that I've come across in a long time. I can't tell you how many hours the entire team wasted (hell, we even let the intern play) playing round after round of this ultra addictive deathmatch. As the folks over at Westwood had warned us, we slowly went through four phases. In the beginning, we all played Warriors  they're fast, they're powerful and, most importantly, they're really easy to control. As we gained experience with the single player mode though, many of us started to switch over to Conjurors and after a while that became the character of choice in the big games. Their ability to use quick missile weapons and to summon immense critters to guard them gave them a seemingly unsurpassable advantage. Next we began to discover the power of the Wizard. While playing as one of these spell slingers takes an amazing amount of aim and control (not to mention courage) if you're up against someone who's skilled at it, they're a force to be reckoned with. Finally, each of us found a particular type of character that we were best with and our games begin to show a little diversity.  There are several different play modes, each of which I found to be pretty amazing. First off, there's the standard deathmatch in which all of the different players in the game run around like little monkeys and try to kill one another. It may sound base, but this is the game that we just kept coming back to. There's nothing more exciting than seeing the Warrior who was about to slay your manaless Wizard get creamed by  a giant Mechanical Golem who was summoned by a  nearby Conjuror. From here you can move over to team deathmatch, which offers a load of new strategies as you can travel with a character who makes up for all of your weaknesses (a Wizard and a Warrior travelling together are bad news). Next up is Capture the Flag, another IGNPC favorite. Unless you've got a lot of people here, the Warrior has a bit of an unfair advantage (he can just run in and get the flag, taking abuse long enough to get away), but with a crowd going the back and forth battles can take forever. Capture the Flag is a great place for Wizards to practice their spell trap abilities as well. Watching a Warrior run into a Stun/Fumble/Death Ray is always entertaining. Elimination is a simple last-man-standing game that just ups the ante a little from Deathmatch. This was probably our least favorite mode, but that's just because we're really impatient. King of the Realm was a great hit with our strategy guys (who are busy working on the Nox guide right now). In this mode, there is a crown hidden somewhere in the level. When you put it on, you start collecting points. Whoever ends the game with the most points wins. Last but not least is an interesting variation on Capture the Flag called Flag Ball. Here there's a single ball placed on the level and points are scored by picking up the ball and throwing it at the enemy flag. Whoever ends the game with the most points wins. Like Capture the Flag, this game is best when there are a lot  of participants.  Okay, so if all of this is so much fun, why didn't we give the game a '10'? Unfortunately, Nox does have its share of problems. In addition to the pacing and difficulty issues I mentioned earlier, the game also has several bugs that pop up from time to time that really hurt the way the game plays. The first (and most irritating) is a multiplayer bug that causes certain players to be able to enter a game without being able to see any of the other players. Unfortunately for them, other players can see them and usually end up killing them mercilessly over and over again. Tal got nailed with this one a couple of times and I thought he was going to throw his computer out the window in his frustration. There is also another crash bug that we've read a lot about on the message boards that seems to affect users who have AMD processors that are overclocked. I imagine that both of these issues will be addressed in short order by Westwood, but users should be aware that the problems exist. I also have to confess to having a problem with the game's principle sound effect, the spell casters chant. Since your caster makes this noise every single time he casts a spell, I had to turn my sound off to keep from getting super annoyed.  In the end, Nox is a fantastic game that I highly recommend to just about everyone. The problems it does have are minor and will most likely be fixed by the company in the next few weeks. If you've got the machine to run it and you're looking for something new in multiplayer gaming, I urge you to go out and pick up a copy of this fine game.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Feb 26, 2000"}
