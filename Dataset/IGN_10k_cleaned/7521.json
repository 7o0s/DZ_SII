While there's no doubt that some games have much better mazes, weapons and bad guys than others, the basic ideas behind the game remain pretty much the same. In Redline, Accolade seeks to alleviate this situation by tacking a driving simulation onto the basic formula and opening up level design to accommodate them. At first glance this seems like a great idea - you and your friends driving around a Mad Max world trying to kill each other while jumping in and out of high-powered cars. Unfortunately the end result never quite lives up to this promise.   The storyline is just what you'd expect it to be - an excuse to get in a lot fights. You play a tough loner who's home is attacked by a band of apocalyptic cannibals. In seeking to save yourself you draw the attention of the Company, an organized military group that squeezes local townships for money in return for keeping them safe from attacks like the one you just experienced. After passing a rudimentary test, you're given a chance to join the group and to avenge the destruction of your home on every group of crazed raiders who prowl the wasteland. Each of your missions is set up with appallingly long movies that feature a lot of very bad voice acting and images of your character standing very still while someone else drones on for what seems like hours. Once the mission actually starts, you'll usually be treated to more footage of your car driving through the rugged landscape to wherever it is that your mission takes place. Eventually the lectures will relent and you'll actually get a chance to play the game.  Each mission you'll have different mission objectives that you must complete in order to finish the level and move on. Most of these objectives are actually tied to your movement around the levels, so it's impossible to drive somewhere that you're not supposed to go yet until you've finished your goals within a certain region. Although your objectives will sound pretty different each time - blow up generators, rescue hostages, recover stolen goods - they all end up playing out pretty much the same. You drive around shooting at everything in sight until all of your enemies are destroyed and then you proceed to finish up whatever it was that you were send to do. Even so, the missions are long and well designed, and as long as you can figure out exactly what it is that you're supposed to be doing (the mission briefings are really good at telling you what to do, but not how to do it) you can loose yourself in them pretty quickly.  You defend yourself each level with a handy gun that's straight out of the Transformers movie. This Ronco-like device morphs itself into any weapon that you have ammunition for. If you've got machine gun magazines, it's a machine gun. If you've got shotgun shells it's a shotgun. If you've got rockets... well, you get the idea. If you're unfortunate enough to run out of ammo, this nifty weapon even has a spinning saw-blade that you can use to julienne your opponents. While the idea of a transforming fun may seem a little silly, it's no dumber than the idea of a soldier running at break neck speed through a combat course while weighed down with nine different weapons and ammunition for each. Having a multi-purpose gun also frees you from the frustration of discovering a large pile of high-powered ammo that you can't fire at anyone because you haven't figured out where the gun itself is. If you find it, you can shoot it at someone.  So other than the fact that you're carrying a nifty new gun, how is any of this different from any first-person shooter? As you run around the course, you'll also get access to various cars that you can hop into by running into the driver's-side door. Each vehicle in the game has its own included weaponry that includes everything from vulcan cannons and super-shotguns to rockets (guided and un-guided), missiles and mines. Better still, many of these automobiles have weapons mounted on their sides as well as on the front of the car so that (in theory) you can shoot enemies broadside instead of going for the typical head-on rush that ends up being the norm in any armed driving game. Each vehicle also has its own handling style ranging from frail but nimble trikes to massively armored pigs that take a licking and keep on ticking. At any point, if you decide that you'd be better off on foot, you can hit a key and jump out of the vehicle. Unless you've already killed everyone on the screen though, this is almost always a bad idea. Enemy cars have no qualms about shooting you or, worse still, slamming in to you with their cars, something that will reduce your health to nothing in a very short amount of time. If your car is ever damaged to the point of destruction, you'll automatically be thrown and you'll have to do your best to survive on foot.  Visually Redline is stunning. Although the characters in the game are pretty chunky in design, everything else in the game is drawn beautifully and animates fairly well (in single player mode). Explosion effects are amazing, with loads of Star Wars-like force rings, rumbling earth sequences, and particle fallout. The cars in the game are equally impressive inside and out and look just like you'd expect automobiles in the apocalyptic future to look. Unfortunately the game's sound is not as universally pleasing. Although the game's soundtrack is solid (standard techno fare) and its sound effects are brilliant (that whole rumbling earth thing is really well done), the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard in a game. One of the characters sounds like Froggy from the Little Rascals which makes him very difficult to take seriously.  Okay, this all sounds pretty fun. So what's the problem? Basically it boils down to the details. First off, the game's control scheme is a nightmare. While running around with a gun shooting things is relatively straight forward, trying to drive a car while aiming your weapons and keeping and eye out for nearby enemies is extremely frustrating. You'll find that even with a standard control stick or mouse control you still need a free hand for the keyboard, something that can get pretty irritating (not to mention dangerous) during combat. Although a lot of this problem can be addressed by purchasing a well-equipped programmable joystick or steering wheel, many gamers aren't going to have access to these tools. Even using these devices, I always felt like I was learning to get better at the game despite the interface rather than getting better at using it. Even if you get past the controls, there are a lot of things about Redline that just feel unfinished.  One of the big selling points that Accolade makes on the back of their box is that Redline has, ~massively destructible worlds.~ This is completely true, you can shoot just about anything in the game and it will blow up, usually with a satisfying set of visual explosion effects. The problem is a lot of times this doesn't change the world around you at all. The game is filled with large lampposts that cast light around them in a big circle. If you blow them up, the lamppost disappears, but the lighting remains, an eerie halo caused by nothing. While this may not seem like a big deal, these kind of discrepancies pop up at several points in the game where they directly affect your game. In one of the early levels, you'll have to destroy a set of collectors that are powering a force field that prevents you from getting any further in the game. Once they're gone, the beams that are powering the force field disappear and you can proceed to the next area. The weird thing is, when you turn around and try to go back, the force field has suddenly reappeared, even though the collectors that were powering it have been turned into rubble. This type of unexplained phenomena pops up again and again in the game and can make playing through the single player missions absolutely frustrating. Every time you feel like you're starting to get into Redline, the game slaps you and reminds you that you're playing a video game.  Even multiplayer, the one area that could have saved Redline, has its problems. We played several four-player games in the office and were constantly plagued by slowdown and frame jumping. Even so, I do have to admit that arena play is a lot different from any other first-person experience I've ever had and could be pretty damn fun as long as the lag troubles weren't too severe. The ability to get out of your car and peg enemies from locations where they can't reach you is not only fun in and of itself, but also because of the danger inherent in leaving your car and getting to such a location in the first place.  In the end, Redline isn't a bad game, it's just not nearly as good as it could have been. The game has a lot of great ideas and technology that is crippled by poor control and a general lack of thoroughness in the world's design. If you're a huge first-person shooter fan and you're looking for a multiplayer game that's something very different from what you've played before, you'll probably get some solid gameplay out of Redline. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a single player game that will keep you glued to your screen for hours at a time, there's much better games out there.  -- Trent C.
