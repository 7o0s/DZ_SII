Amping up the group combat action another notch, developer Zipper Interactive, Inc. has brought the bad-ass SEALs back for more in SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs II. The multiplayer's been enhanced and a host of new online maps and single-player missions have been thrown in for good measure. Not quite a complete sequel, SOCOM II plays like an expansion pack, but that's just fine.   Last year, the original SOCOM: US NAVY SEALs got tons of people online, slaughtering each other constantly. What was a familiar world for PC users had been brought onto the TV screen and gamers couldn't get enough. Seeing that there was more work to be done, Zipper went back to their coding cubicles and tweaked away into the night.   Online Gameplay  If you're online, and if you're reading this you probably are, then you want to get to the meat and potatoes right away. In a word, is it worth it to run out and get this game for online play? Yes, it definitely is. Bigger and more is better after all and SOCOM II is bursting at the seams with new stuff.   There are now a total of 22 maps to get your snipe on. A dozen new ones and 10 from the original. The new maps all feature gun turrets that players can jump on and a couple new modes of play. The old maps weren't ignored because they got jacked up with gun turrets as well as being enhanced with more shrubbery to hide in.    The two new modes here are Breach and Escort. In Breach, victory can be gained by using a bomb to blow up an enemy's HQ. There are two variations on this theme. In one, one team has a base with turrets and defends against intruders trying to blow up its central building. The other has symmetrical gameplay in which one bomb is in the middle of the map and either side can grab it to blow up the other base. Of course, you can still kill the other team for victory.    Escort is an exercise in moving civilians through a warzone. SEALs need to get VIPs to an extraction zone. Instead of a linear map, there are two extraction zones in the maps, separated by a decent amount of distance, making each terrorist choose which one to defend. To balance it out, gun turrets near each extraction point give the terrorist team a bit of an advantage.   A few of the maps have some changeable environments that can affect the game. Some bridges are really a few planks of loose wood across a gap. These makeshift passes make high towers and rooftops accessible, but since they're so rickety, a couple of bullets will take them out. In one Breach map, a bridge connected a sniping tower to a main building. In an Escort map, a bridge connected an extraction point to some other rooftops. In both cases, the destruction of the bridge called for a change in tactics. I only wish there was more of the same. Perhaps blowing up a wall or collapsing a tunnel to constantly change how the maps need to be approached.   In playing these maps online, there was a good sense of balance in the gameplay. Different teams have different advantages like the extraction zones with the gun turrets. Invading forces have a variety of entrances, but each one can be covered by a powerful gun. If the SEAL team coordinated together, they could bum rush one entrance and easily take out the terrorist manning the turret. If the terrorist team was watching the advance, they could trigger one hell of an ambush.   After some practice with the turrets, one fact quickly popped up. If you man a turret and start firing, everyone knows where you are. Run it too long and any fool with a rifle and a good view is sure to take you out. One strategy is to hide down behind it and jump up when a teammate calls out to you to gun down invading forces. The element of surprise is what works and any camper who outstays his welcome will be sure to become fodder.     A unique new weapon is the anti-personnel mine. It's useful if you know exactly where someone is going to go, you're sure it won't be yourself or a teammate, and it can be hidden. Otherwise, it can often get wasted or backfires bigtime. These are triggered by someone walking on them or another explosion. Put a few close together and a daisy chain explosion will go off. While it's a good idea, it's difficult to put into practice. Several attempts at using it created some ill feelings in our team. Finding yourself killed by a friendly fire mine is one of the most infuriating things in SOCOM II. It's a tricky new device that's just not as much fun as a good old gun or grenade. It would be the perfect camper tool for those who prefer to fight their battles from far away.   One major new weapon in terms of firepower is the rocket launcher. It takes a long time to reload and you can't move once you've decided to use it, but it packs a hell of a wallop. It slices through tanks and renders entire interiors exterior if you get my drift. It's almost more hassle than it's worth, but it's definitely the most satisfying weapon in SOCOM II. It's also not easy to get access to, requiring that you complete the single-player game on the hardest setting.   The rest of the new weapons are variations on the theme of what's already existed. The grenade launcher has moved from single-player to the multiplayer and gives the ability to shoot frag and smoke grenades a lot easier in combat. The rest of the list fills out with new rifles and shotguns. They help to enhance the game a bit, but not as much as the maps. After trying out a laundry list of weapons we kept slipping back to using the rifle and the 9mm with a few grenades in the belt, just in case.   To make the game better, Zipper has worked on preventing players from cheating. Snipers can't slip into the walls any more to be the spineless campers they truly are. It's still amazing that some gamers find fun in playing a dull game where they're invincible. Well, now they'll be forced to duke it out with the rest of the honest folk. For that alone, SOCOM II is almost worth the price of admission.    If you're still reading this and trying to decide whether to go out and buy it for an online game, just do it. The new maps, modes, guns, and cheating protection all together will justify the purchase. If you're looking for the single-player game, that's another story.   Single-Player Gameplay  With so many changes happening in the online game, one has to wonder why anyone would bother with the single-player game. After playing through the 12 missions, we had to wonder why anyone would care either. It's a well-done experience, but the lack of any checkpoints within missions, the repetitiveness, and the tendency toward long, slow crawls rob it of lasting value and fun.   The essence of SOCOM II is stealth, just like its predecessor. Keeping out of sight and being quiet are the two golden rules. Slowly moving and sniping enemies from afar become a large majority of the action. Sometimes both will be combined when you slowly move up to a corner, peek around, and snipe a guard or a security camera. To properly do a mission, and get a high score from your commanders in the wrap-up, it can take more than a half an hour.   This leads us to the biggest problem in SOCOM II: there are no checkpoints. At no point within the mission can you save your progress. This means that if you mess up at any time the whole thing is a wash and you need to start all over again. Watching 20 or 30 minutes go up in smoke is enough to make any gamer toss the controller on the floor. By doing the first half of some levels over and over, I was able to practically sleepwalk through the first 10 minutes or so.    Even with this frustrating philosophy of game saving, I was able to finish the game in about 10 hours. With such a short time considering the constant replays of long segments, it's a definite disappointment. If checkpoints were enabled, it would have taken about half as long to finish the entire game and it looks like a ploy to make SOCOM II's single player section look bigger than it really is.      Add the fact that most of those 10 hours were used slowly moving the four SEALs around and one is reminded that war is 99% tedium and 1% terror. It's a shame because the missions did have a lot of promise and were fun when they were allowed to be.    SOCOM II is broken up into four chapters with three missions each. Storylines follow different groups of terrorists with their own goals. Each chapter has its own location as well. They are, in order, Albania, Brazil, Algiers and Russia. Brazilian guerrilla terrorists seek to form a new national army while the Russian terrorists want to explode dirty bombs in the U.S. Whatever the rationale, the SEALs are there to ensure democracy is served.   SOCOM II starts off well in Albania, a European countryside with lots of bushes and broken down buildings provide plenty of places in which to hide and crawl. With mountains to crawl around, rivers to wade through, dark tunnels to creep in, and busted up churches to sneak in, it set the mood perfectly for a mission to bust up a black market operation.   The best mission of the 12 is set in Brazil when the SEALs need to fight their way through the crowded slums. Every room and ladder brought some new surprises. Running from building to building and fighting a renegade army brought the game to the level of what it should have been, a combination of action and stealth. The cramped buildings created a sense of claustrophobia and confusion. With the terrain changing at every turn, I kept wondering what was going to happen next.   By the time the game finishes up in Russia, it seems the designers ran out of ideas. In the last mission, set on a cargo ship, most of the action is as simple as opening up a door, shooting, and repeating it all over again. Defusing bombs provides a minor distraction, but finishing the game is more of a relief that it's over. Instead of building up to a big payoff mission, the Russia missions were more of a formality.    At least there's a payoff for finishing the whole game. To access the special multiplayer features like hidden characters or weapons (to be more specific, grenade launcher and the rocket launcher), the single-player game needs to be finished on different difficulty levels. There are five of them: Ensign, Lieutenant, Commander, Captain, and Admiral. At first, only the first three are available. To be able to play with every weapon, at least three runs through the whole game are required. That's a few dozen hours of crawling around to get the big guns and a different costume.   AI Pitfalls  For most of SOCOM II, gamers will thank the gaming gods for their squadmates. They follow orders, cover your back, and can pick off enemies for you. Sometimes, just sometimes, they'll make you scratch your head. Ladders can be a particular problem. It can happen where instead of climbing down a ladder, a SEAL will jump down. I once saw a SEAL jump some 20 feet and take a big hit to his life. When leading your group down a ladder you'll hear some Three Stooges sounds behind you as they pile on top of each other. To add insult to injury, your teamwork rating will be lower because your teammates were wounded in ~battle.~   Less often, SEALs have had problems going up a ladder as well. One particular ladder on a Brazilian level gave my Bravo team problems. The mission was to drop down into an underground drug lab, kill the workers, set up a satchel, and clear the area for an explosion. The first three parts went smoothly but for some reason one of my Bravo team members wouldn't climb up. On climbing back down, I had found that he had merged with the ladder and couldn't move. The next time, both members of Bravo team were stuck. Climbing back down, I had found them merged into each other. By giving them new orders I got them unstuck and able to climb back up. This happened occasionally in other areas as well. A character will get stuck on a tree or a bush and telling them to lie down and get up again gets them free. Usually the AI is spot on, but inanimate objects can get in the way.    Graphics  In providing the look and feel of the different locations, SOCOM II's graphics are spot on. The slums of Brazil are straight out of real life and the Algiers streets twist and turn and have random dead-ends just like you'd expect. It's clear that a lot of work was done researching the true locations to make the maps accurate. Plenty of little touches like flags and posters have been thrown in for local flavor.   The graphics themselves have taken a step forward and there is a little more detail in the maps. Bushes now move when you crawl through them instead of hazily disappearing in front of you. It adds a new measure to the stealth when you can spot someone creeping in the bushes when the tops start moving about. This also makes it harder to shoot from inside the bushes because your head needs to fully poke out in order to see a target.   Other light effects are effective and accurate. Look up at the sky and the contrast changes drastically, making it hard to make out any detail on the ground. Run from a well-lit area into the shadows and it takes a few seconds for your eyes to adjust. Look at a flash grenade and your whole field of vision will go white as you're blinded. When it slowly comes back, the dark details come back first, the color filling in soon after.    Sound  Where the graphics provide the visual environment the sound fills it with life, utilizing Dolby Pro Logic II for those who have it. The voices really stand out and you'll heard them coming from all sides. Your squadmates call out incoming enemies and gloat over a successful kill. Overhearing a conversation is usually not a tactical advantage, but they often have dialogue that's worth listening to for hearing what the enemy has to say. It turns out that terrorists take the time to wonder just how long the revolution will really last or if the terrorist leader has the hots for them. It works, too, because sometimes I felt bad about killing off a guy I enjoyed hearing talk.     The sound effects and the music are well worth the effort of hooking up your PS2 to a well-fit stereo system. Since stealth is so important you want to hear if you're making too much noise. From gravel to sand to crunchy snow, the various terrain produces different sounds depending on your speed. When I cringed from a loud footstep I mistakenly made, I knew that the sound was doing its job. A personal favorite is when a bomb goes off nearby. The sound goes way down for a few seconds, only to be filled with a ringing sound as your ears recuperate.   When a gun goes off, the sound is so good that you can tell how far away it was or even if it was behind a wall. In the thick of a firefight, you can tell if a sniper was firing at you from far away or your buddies were in the other room, taking care of business. Moving through a complicated situation is so much easier because your ears can sometimes tell you more about what's going on than your eyes.The new online maps, multiplayer modes, and weapons make SOCOM II an easy choice for those bent to play online. Everything has been improved and added to and it's more fun to get into. The developers have been paying attention and it shows. The single-player game is another story entirely. With missions that start off as being fun quickly turning into repetitive slogs as large chunks need to be replayed over and over again. Playing through the game becomes more of a chore than a challenge, especially since that is the only way to access the hidden multiplayer weapons and characters. The single-player experience is for the hardcore stealth fans out there and doesn't pack in enough game time to satisfy those who won't be going online. When the levels balance out the action and the stealth, as about half of the missions do, it can be a fun time. The long stretches of crawling around for the rest of the time will leave you time to wish you had a network adapter. All in all, SOCOM II is a great online expansion pack, but a weaker single-player game.", "date": "Nov 4, 2003"}
