{"name": "MediEvil", "name_review": "MediEvil Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/10/medievil-review", "text": "First hitting the original PlayStation back in October of 1998, MediEvil followed the exploits of one Daniel Fortesque, a hapless soldier killed during the opening rush of battle who is brought back to life a century later. Arisen as a bumbling skeleton, Daniel had been denied entry into the Hall of Heroes as he never actually made it into battle and then sought out to prove his worth for entry.   The game was released with reasonable acclaim, and saw a sequel two years later in the form of the aptly-named MediEvil II. Then in late 2005, the original was reborn on the PSP in the form of MediEvil Resurrection with updated graphics and so forth. And now, available via the PlayStation Store, Sony has re-released the original game for play on the PSP.    Though the game still has a handful of redeeming qualities, like its overall charm and sense of humor along with the numerous weapons at your disposal, it doesn't hold up quite as well as some other PlayStation titles we've seen released on the PSN. Part of this is because of MediEvil Resurrection's existence - the original may be cheaper, but it also pales in comparison in a number of ways, especially visually.   The game's age is most apparent with regards to its controls. Movement can feel sloppy, especially with having to double-tap in order to run. The standard walk speed is so slow that we don't know why you'd want to use it in most cases, so you'll find that you'll constantly have to double-tap anytime you move. There's an auto-run feature in the options menu, though the game won't allow you to turn it on from the PSP.   There are also some curious bits about the general design, especially with regards to some of the level layouts. Doorways lead to exits with no signs, so you don't know if you're going to another section, back to the overview map or what - it can feel confusing and a little disjointed. There are also some segments where what you need to do or where you need to go isn't clear. For instance, leaving the Hall of Heroes (which you'll visit often to pick up new weapons and such) isn't by means of a doorway, but by standing on a circle for a few seconds. Nothing tells you this, and we actually had to consult a FAQ online to figure out how to get out of there.    Still, the game's humor and overall style is pretty funny and can make it a worthy romp if you don't feel like plunking down the cash for the UMD remake and are somewhat bored. The wide variety and mass number of weapons keeps the combat feeling fresh throughout the game (even if it's extremely basic) and some of the environments are pretty interesting.MediEvil has certainly gotten a little stale over the years, especially after it was given a fresh coat of icing with the release of its remake, MediEvil Resurrection, just a couple years ago. Its humor may helps give it a decent sense of style, but too many of its mechanics and design elements hold it back from being an engaging experience.", "date": "Apr 10, 2007"}
