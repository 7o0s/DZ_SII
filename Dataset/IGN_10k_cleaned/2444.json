{"name": "Monster Rancher", "name_review": "Monster Rancher", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/11/20/monster-rancher", "text": "It's a fact of business: familiarity sells. People flock to sequels because they know what to expect. Likewise, people buy big game sequels because they enjoyed the original. They're safe buys for the consumer, and safe releases for the publisher. That's all good and well, but sometimes the market can seem a little homogeneous. Kudos to Tecmo then for having the nerve to release Monster Rancher, an incredibly original title that also happens to be a barrel of fun.  Following in the current virtual pet trend, Monster Rancher lets gamers raise, train, and fight randomly generated monsters. It's a little odd, so pay attention. Monster Rancher creates monsters based on data it pulls off other CDs, whether game or music. Each one will result in a different monster with its own look and attributes. This alone is worth the price of the game, as you never know what you'll get!  Once you've got your monster, take it to the ranch and send it to work. Working at different tasks helps increase attributes like strength and speed. Plus you earn money for each successful job which is then used to further care for your monster. You can send it away to be trained as well, although this is quite pricey.  Eventually a tournament will roll around, and your monster will get to fight, which you control. Other players can boot up their monsters from memory cards and compete as well.  It's difficult to explain just how fun Monster Rancher is, but it really is addicting. After all the time you've spent with your monster -- feeding it, scolding or praising it, letting it rest -- it almost feels alive. Like the Tamagotchi, it brings out strange parental feelings you may not know you possessed.  Monster Rancher excels at virtual life, but lacks somewhat in graphics and music. The monsters themselves may be polygonal, but the rest of the game is very sprite-based, with little pop-up animated windows depicting your creature at work or rest. It's quaint, yes, but also smacks of old 16-bit games. The music is dated as well, sounding more like a Genesis game than something from a CD.  In the end, though, you're not going to buy Monster Rancher for the music. You're going to buy it because it's the only game of its kind available in the US, and it's amazing.
