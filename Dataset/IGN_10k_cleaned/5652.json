When Iron Phoenix was announced last year it raised all sorts of eyebrows. The game promised weapon driven combat, a single player story mode, and the ability for 16 players to duke it out on Xbox Live. With each viewing, the game's feature list raised more questions than answers, but after playing the scaled down final version we are finally able to deliver a verdict.    The first thing that gamers should know is that the story mode has been removed from the game. Originally, each weapon was to have a back-story that would unfold in the single player mode. Instead, there is only a short training session and an offline mode that simulates the online battles with CPU controlled bots. Some gamers won't mind this omission. Fighting games hardly ever have interesting single player modes, and there's no reason to hold Iron Phoenix to a higher standard. Most fighting games do however support an offline multiplayer mode, and unfortunately, Iron Phoenix does not. If you are not an Xbox Live subscriber this game has very little to offer. Even so, the hook for this game was the online multiplayer mode and that is still included, so anyone with an Xbox Live account should read on.      The basic premise of Iron Phoenix is somewhat strange, but its unique qualities don't end with online multiplayer. Instead of basing combat around the character's unique fighting styles, the game focuses on nine legendary weapons. While characters have their own agility, attack, and defense attributes, their real abilities are decided by what weapon they take into battle. This means that even the smallest character fights like a 400-pound behemoth when carrying the enormous Meteor Hammer. Each weapon has its own move set and special attacks. This is an interesting idea, but ultimately it doesn't change the gameplay. Instead of forming an affinity for a certain character, players will choose one or two favorite weapons and stick with them.    There are many combat options in Iron Phoenix and it takes a number of games to pin down the basic moves outside of each weapon's specific attacks. Each character can dash, wall run, perform air attacks, throw darts, and charge explosive chi moves. Advanced moves include a cloud tread, which allows characters to add extra height to a jump and an energized mode that boosts attack power and raises defense. The actual attacks feel slightly unresponsive, and since the advanced moves are often strange button combinations, many players resort to button mashing. This is where a single-player mode would have come in handy. The tutorial quickly covers the basics, but it doesn't provide nearly enough practice with the advanced techniques for gamers to jump into a multiplayer match.    There are five game modes that can be played on or off-line. As I mentioned earilier, there is no split screen mode, but there are bots with scalable A.I. The first mode is of course the old standby, deathmatch. Its a simple kill-or-be-killed setup, but the format is not conducive to Iron Phoenix' style of gameplay. While the game encourages players to run on walls, seek out items, and perform a variety of attacks, matches often degenerate into a mob of people in the center of a level, mindlessly hacking away. There are many situations where gamers will enter into a good one-on-one duel, only to have some jerk jump in at the last second and steal the kill. This is a common occurrence in first-person shooters, but because the battles in Iron Phoenix last much longer than a typical fire-fight, having a kill stolen is much more frustrating.    This was most apparent in my first couple of deathmatches when my fighting skills were still lacking. I decided to keep my distance from center of the arena and instead wait for two fighters to wear each other down. This was something of a guessing game, considering enemies have no visible life bars. Once a character was on the verge of expiring, I would jump into the fray and let loose with some chi attacks. This method easily earned me one or two kills and provoked slew of insults from the contestants I had interrupted. It seems cheap, but this is the way Iron Phoenix is structured.      There is a method by which two players can separate themselves from the action and make sure no one else interferes. By pressing back + B, players can enter into ~bloodlock combat~. This engulfs the characters in a sphere that locks out other contestants. While in this mode players continually lose health but regain health by attacking. There are a few problems with this feature. First off, offering a challenge and waiting for an opponent to accept can be difficult when there are 14 other players hitting you in the back of the head with war hammers. Second, entering this mode guarantees that someone is going die. Personally, I'd rather take my chances outside of a bloodlock sphere where it's possible to leech off of other people's hard work.    Even with these problems, deathmatch can still be pretty fun. The arenas are large and sport some cool environmental effects. The glowing lava of the Castle Entrance level makes for a dramatic backdrop and a deadly resting place for contestants who hang around too close to the edge. It's also impressive to stand back and witness the amount of action that takes place in these massive brawls. There are also four other modes that offer more structured challenges.     First off, there is a one-on-one game type called the challenge ring. Gamers try to win a series of matches in order to advance to the champion's ring. Between rounds, players are relegated to a spectator area where they can view the other battles. One-on-one fights can be entertaining depending on the skill level of your opponent. But, unless you enjoy watching other people compete, the spectator mode is pretty useless.    Team deathmatch continues the age-old tradition of the red team trying to kill the blue team and vice-versa. The creation of teams makes the game less chaotic and inspires teamwork and planned assaults. Without the help of teammates, a fighter will be left to face two or more enemies at the same time and this almost always ends in defeat. There is also a team kill which requires every member of the team to use a maximum team strike for a massive attack that clears the battlefield of foes. VIP mode is similar to team deathmatch except it designates one player as a team leader who is able to revive their teammates. In order to win, a team must take out the other leader.   There is a third version of team deathmatch called ~giant kill~ and involves a few oversized, super-powerful players battling a slew of normal characters. The war rages on until the giants fall or a quota of small people have been wiped out. This mode is entertaining for a short time, but it would have been nice to see some more complicated rule sets like capture the flag, or zones implemented in Iron Phoenix   The team aspect of the game works the best so gamers will be happy to know that Iron Phoenix supports clans and competitions. Team leaders can sign up for one competition at a time and take on rival clans. All online match information is stored in the handy statistics area which keeps track of user and friend stats for every mode. There are already two maps available for download over Live, which is nice to see considering the game takes place almost exclusively online.    Graphics  The environments in Iron Phoenix are large and sprawling compared to most fighting games. They also contain a decent level of detail and some pretty effects like waterfalls or glowing fires. The characters themselves are good looking specimens, and the fireworks of combat can be eye popping. Instead of picking up a barrel, a character warps space and lifts the object into the air with Chi powers. When weapons clash, glowing particles are dispersed into the air, and maximum chi strikes erupt like high powered fireworks.    My online experience wasn't without its share of technical flaws. In all of the game types I experienced some lag and stuttering. This is to be expected with so many players moving around the massive arenas but it also hampers the gameplay. In a good fighting game, two experienced players should be able to face off on an even footing. Every attack and sidestep contributes to who will be declared the ultimate victor. This creates the tension and excitement in a battle. When one combatant warps across the screen due to a poor connection, the flow of the fight is destroyed.      Sound  Musically, the game mixes the sounds of the Far East with heavy metal guitar tracks. This is an odd choice, but it almost makes sense considering the chaotic gameplay it accompanies. There is also the option for custom soundtracks, which you will often hear blaring through other player's headsets. The raucous sounds of battle are the most appealing audio aspects of Iron Phoenix's. Characters scream with pain, shout out verbal challenges, and let out battle cries as they dash at their enemies.    Closing Comments  Iron Phoenix showed promise in its early stages, but ultimately it is unable to deliver in many areas of gameplay. Without a story mode, the game is essentially only an online brawler that offers very little to people who don't play on Live. The online mode has its share of problems mostly concerning the quagmire that is deathmatch. If you are looking for a good online fighting game there are plenty of better options that offer more features for less money. Check out Dead or Alive Ultimate, Mortal Kombat: Deception, or Street Fighter Anniversary Collection. As for Iron Phoenix, its highly recommended that gamers rent this game before plunking down 50 dollars.", "date": "Mar 31, 2005"}
