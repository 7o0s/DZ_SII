This 8-bit take on professional ice hockey originally arrived on the NES just in time for Christmas in 1988, and managed to repeat the feat this past Christmas season by showing up in the Wii Shop just one day prior to the holiday on December 24. It was a welcome stocking stuffer, too, because this is a game that still has legions of fans, even 20 years after its original release. Maybe it's because of the fighting.   One of the signature elements of Blades of Steel's interpretation of the NHL is its fistfights, where after two opposing players meet up on the ice in one too many high-speed collisions, they actually do throw down their gloves, put up their dukes and try not to get sent to the penalty box. The gameplay shifts from the overall camera view of the skating rink to a zoomed-in, close-up perspective of the two men, now standing and facing off against one another in a viewpoint reminiscent of Street Fighter or Urban Champion. You throw jabs and hooks with the B and A Buttons and try to land five hits before your opponent does the same  and the player who loses the fight is the one who gets put in time-out for the next few minutes.   Fighting isn't all there is to Blades of Steel, of course, but it's a good place to start in describing this effort's gameplay, because it's representative of the overall feel of the game  it's tough, no nonsense hockey that doesn't mind playing dirty. The core gameplay is a standard simulation of the sport, with five men and a goalie lining up on either side of the ice and trying to control the puck, then attempting to score by slapping shots into the opposition's net. It's focused and tight with no frills at all. The gameplay stands on its own.   The face-off looks civilized now, but in about five minutes those guys will be trying to punch each other's lights out.  And the gameplay stands in opposition to the competition of the NES era, as players' other choice in 8-bit hockey simulation in '88 was Nintendo's own Ice Hockey. The hook of that release  which is also available for download on the Virtual Console  was its differentiated players. You could customize your squad of skaters with men who were skinny, fat or medium-sized, each of which had its own strengths and weaknesses. Blades of Steel's men are all the same shape, though. The competition here is always perfectly evenly matched, as no player has any advantage in speed or power over any other.   It boils down to straight-up skill, then, as you pass the puck from man to man (your active player blinks with a white glow to let you know who you're currently controlling) and try to advance down the ice to set up a shot on goal. When you come near enough to the net, you'll see an arrow icon moving up and down along the edge of the goal's opening  that's where your shot will be placed, so you need to try to time your press of the A Button when the opposing goalie is clear of that same arrow.   Several presentation aspects are notable in Blades of Steel, including the game's array of teams, its difficulty selector and its halftime show. The team array is evocative of the NHL without actually being licensed  there are eight total teams representing different cities/states in Canada and the U.S., and their colors are set to be similar to those used on the uniforms of those same NHL franchises in those same locations two decades ago. The difficulty selector offers three options, essentially easy, medium and hard, and you'd do well to start off on easy and work your way up from there.    But the halftime show has to be the most notable of all, because Konami got shamelessly self-promotional there in the '80s. After the second period has concluded, you're taken to a view of the scoreboard. Then the score display will give way to various advertisements for other Konami NES games like Jackal or Contra  or, more unexpectedly, the screen will shift to a brief playable mini-game version of Gradius. This microgame take on Gradius is an element you might have also seen in Konami's The Legend of the Mystical Ninja, which is also available on the VC. It's a fun little extra and nostalgic for old-school Konami fans.When first reviewing Ice Hockey on the Virtual Console way back in December of 2006, I put a lot of emphasis on the rivalry between that game and this one  it really was a case of either/or in the '80s, as few young NES fans had the cash to be able to own both editions in their original cartridge forms. And the debate will still rage as to which one was really the better game to play, with Ice Hockey standing firm on its foundation of old-school Nintendo quirkiness and Blades of Steel offering a more standard, focused, grittier play experience. But now that both games are available for just five bucks, why not go for both? Especially if you've already downloaded Ice Hockey in the past  it's only an additional investment of 500 more Wii Points to get Blades as well and choose for yourself which you think is superior. That's got to be the ultimate recommendation here, and if you just can't pick between the two, flip a coin. You'll end up having solid 8-bit hockey fun no matter which way you go.", "date": "Feb 4, 2008"}
