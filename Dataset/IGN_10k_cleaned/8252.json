Rick Taylor, main character and hero of Splatterhouse, is dead. He and his girlfriend, Jennifer, were on a student field trip to research the parapsychological oddities rumored to exist inside an old and abandoned mansion. On arriving at the manor, the two intended to keep their distance and study the structure from afar. A storm swept in, though, forcing them to seek shelter inside.   Once there, the building transformed. The West Mansion, overcome by evil, metamorphosized into the Splatterhouse  demons swept in and kidnapped Jennifer, then brutalized and murdered Rick. He's supposed to be the hero here. And he's stone cold dead in the prologue.   He doesn't stay dead, of course. Rick is resurrected and revived by the power of the mask  the Terror Mask, a facial plating Rick finds is permanently affixed when he awakens hours later. Driven by the dark emotion of the mask and a thirst for revenge, Rick stalks after Jennifer's captors and unleashes his rage on the demonic denizens of the house in disturbingly graphic ways.   Splatterhouse is a side-scrolling brawler filled, overflowing, with guts, gore and blood. And fountains of puss. And putrid, wriggling parasitic worms, and death by decapitation. No big deal today. Today's gamers have seen worse in Silent Hill, or Manhunt, or The Suffering. In 1988, though, it was unheard of.          Splatterhouse was the game for disgusting, disturbing imagery now almost two decades ago  it was one of the first ever horror games, using shock value to attract passers-by into dropping in a quarter or two. There in the arcades, players with strong enough constitutions could enter the world of the house, clearly presented as a diseased and twisted mash-up of the most popular themes of Hollywood horror.   Chief among them, our dead-but-resurrected hero. Rick's an unmistakable take off Jason Voorhees of the Friday the 13th film franchise, his defining Terror Mask bearing more than passing resemblance to Jason's signature goalie gear. It was a clear infringement in the arcade. On the Turbo, it's not so egregious.   Because the color of the mask went from white to red in the home console transition  and that's not the only change. The version of Splatterhouse we're getting here on the VC is a port of the TurboGrafx-16 port of the arcade original, and that means more than a few sacrifices are made. In addition to the Jason connection being downplayed, there's a downgrade in visuals. The backgrounds are much more simplistic in this edition, and the characters aren't animatedly as fluidly.   Or as fluidically  they don't bleed and splatter as much. The violence is toned down, along with several audio cues like moans and screams. They're reduced in volume, or removed entirely.   So Splatterhouse, an arcade title of over-the-top gore, became a home console game with a considerably lesser number of offensive images. You won't want to buy this game just to see what the fuss was all about in the '80s. A lot of that fuss is gone. But you probably won't want to buy it just for its gameplay, either.   It's a limited brawling affair. Putting aside the aesthetic design and just looking at the game on the merits of its mechanics, Splatterhouse is lacking. It scrolls in strictly one direction, with no depth to its playing field. Its combat is built on very basic punches and kicks, with grabbable weaponry mixing things up, but only occasionally. Some of the more intriguing weapons, like the meat cleaver, are again censored in this version. You'll get instead a wooden two-by-four, which is not nearly so satisfying to wield.   Rick's adventure, too, is not very long. The Splatterhouse houses seven different levels, some of them with multiple paths to progress. But altogether, the sum is not too large  even new players could breeze through this one, beginning to end, in about half an hour.   So it's just as well that Rick was dead  most gamers probably wouldn't have minded him staying that way. Except, of course, that Splatterhouse then couldn't have become a lasting franchise. This game was just the first in a series, as Rick's quest for revenge eventually continued into Splatterhouses 2 and 3, both games that improved on the basics established here in the original and both good candidates for the Virtual Console sometime down the road. And in today's climate of even more shocking survival horror, isn't the Splatterhouse franchise long overdue for a remake? If we can get Manhunt 2 on the Wii, then motion-controlled cleaver-wielding should be a perfect fit.", "date": "Mar 21, 2007"}
