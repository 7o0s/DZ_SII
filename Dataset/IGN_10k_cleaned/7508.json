RedOctane used its experience making dance and drum gaming pads to design a guitar controller while it simultaneously hired veteran developer Harmonix to create the software half of the package. The result was Guitar Hero, a game that went from almost complete obscurity to selling over one million units in under a year - an especially impressive number considering the bundle runs for $70, but surprising to no one who has played it.   It's a year later and RedOctane and Harmonix are ready for their encore performance. Guitar Hero II expands upon the smash-hit original game in almost every way with a greatly expanded (and arguably better) track list, improved multiplayer support, a practice mode and more. The result is a game that seems to have almost everything you could have wished for in the sequel, aside from maybe a pack-in case of beer.    Just to get this out of the way, Guitar Hero II does indeed work with the SG guitar bundled with the original game. The game is available as both a standalone product and a bundle like the original, which this time ships with the cherry red SG.   Even before the game was announced, message board threads cropped up all across the internet with people listing their most-wanted tracks for the sequel. One thing that made the first game great was its track list, and the sequel's music selection is obviously paramount to its success. It's all a matter of personal opinion of course, but in our eyes Guitar Hero II's available tracks are at least as good as the original's, if not better than, which is saying a lot.    RedOctane had trouble nailing down some of the world's bigger bands for the original due to the game being a complete unknown, both from a namesake and potential sales standpoint. This time out, with a now world-famous name and hefty bankroll in its pocket, it wasn't just able to sign some of these bands, but a couple of them even handed over original recordings for use in the game.   From the Rolling Stones to Aerosmith to Nirvana to Van Halen to Rush to Guns N' Roses, the sampled bands here are some of the biggest the world's ever seen. Nope, there's still no Led Zeppelin, Metallica or AC/DC unfortunately, but maybe next time. While most all of the tracks are covers as was the case last time out, Primus and Jane's Addiction turned over the master recordings to ~John the Fisherman~ and ~Stop~, respectively.    Once again, the quality of the covers is phenomenal by and large. From Sting to Ozzy to Steven Tyler, many of the vocal tracks are dead-on perfect to the point where all but lifelong, die-hard fans wouldn't be the wiser, and the tracks might even fool some of them. Some covers are a little easier to pick out, as no one else in the world sounds exactly like Axl Rose for instance, but even these sound fantastic.   There are a couple tracks that aren't up to the level of the bulk of the covers, however. The stand-in for Scott Weiland on Stone Temple Pilots' ~Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart~ can't hit the same high notes as Scott, and generally sounds nasally and compressed. The same is also true of the vocals on Nirvana's ~Heart-Shaped Box~, though here some of the guitar work also sounds a little flat to our ears.    Matching the generally fantastic vocal performances is the instrumentation. The musicianship here is outstanding, not only matching the tracks note for note and pitch for pitch, but in tonality and mixing as well. There are a couple tracks where extraneous solos have been added to spice things up, but they all sound very natural. Kudos once again to the folks over at Wave Group Sound who record all of the music.   Guitar Hero II wouldn't be much fun, or at least feel correct, if the songs didn't play like the real thing, and luckily Harmonix has nailed this once again. Though you only have five buttons to work with on the SG guitar controller, the game makes you feel like you're properly using the entire fret board. As the game's licks billow from your speakers, your fingers dance up and down the neck of the guitar in accordance to how the song is actually played.   Harmonix did take a slight bit of liberty in a few instances and placed chords where single notes are actually played on some songs, like ~Hangar 18~ and ~Psychobilly Freakout~. This is quite obviously a result of attempting to make the game more difficult on Expert than the original, and by and large it worked. Guitar Hero II is hard, a fair bit more difficult than the original. RedOctane and Harmonix noticed that a couple folks out there were able to nail 100% of ~Bark at the Moon~ on Expert in the original game, and some of the tracks here seem to have been chosen specifically for them.   By the time you hit the acoustic opening to Heart's ~Crazy on You~ and the Stray Cats' frantic ~Rock This Town~ in the game's sixth tier of songs (out of eight), you'll realize that Guitar Hero II's Expert difficulty was designed to stump those who'd managed to squeak through ~Cowboys from Hell~ and ~Bark at the Moon~ last time around. Reverend Horton Heat's ~Psychobilly Freakout~ begins with a riff that might as well be called a repeating solo, and the myriad of solos in ~Hangar 18~ will keep you gasping for Star Power.   And don't even try Dick Dale's ~Misirlou~ until you can break the sound barrier with the SG's paddle strummer...    While Guitar Hero II certainly steps up the difficulty, the brand-spankin'-new Practice mode is exactly what the doctor ordered. Practice mode lets you play a song at one of four speeds and drops the accompanying music into the background, letting you focus more on the guitar part. Each song is broken into a series of pieces, and you can choose any beginning and ending point you want. So if you're fine with a tune's intro, verse and first chorus but need help with its bridge, solo and second chorus, you can section those off and repeat only those pieces.   While we might have wished for the ability to flat-out pause a song to better examine some of the fastest riffs in the game, Practice mode is extremely helpful and fantastically implemented. After trying ~Carry Me Home~ by Living End a few times and failing miserably at its confusing onslaught of notes, I loaded the song into the Practice mode for about five minutes, practiced at two different speeds and then passed the song on my next real attempt. A few of the solos in ~Hangar 18~ had me a little puzzled, and Practice mode made it extremely easy to learn individual sections without having to play through the first and comparatively easy half of the song again and again. Fantastic stuff.    While much of the game's mechanics work the same as they did in the original, there are a few differences. Three button chords is the biggest addition to the formula, requiring an extra finger to pull off these massive parts. Harmonix went somewhat easy on us with these killer chords, mostly using them to finish off a big riff or on a lasting chord that needed some extra oomph. There are sections that make plentiful use of them, but most of the time it's a strumming section or something similar, so you're not frantically changing from one to another. We have a feeling it won't be so simple next time around...   Hammer-ons and pull-offs work a little better this time around. For those unfamiliar with this technique, a hammer-on is when you play one note and then play a higher note without strumming a second time. A pull-off is the opposite, moving down the fret board. Both moves seem to be a little easier to perform this time around, as we've had less trouble hitting extremely long sequences of repeating or running notes. It's still not perfect, with some sections not responding as nicely or consistently as we'd hoped, but overall things are a little smoother this time around.    The first game was an absolute blast to play with a friend, and Guitar Hero II's multiplayer takes things to the next level. One addition that we're extremely thankful for is the ability for each player to independently choose a difficulty level. Last time around, experienced players would have to play at the lower levels with new players so that they could keep up. Now, each player can choose from Easy, Medium, Hard or Expert and cater the difficulty to their playing level.   The Face-Off mode returns from the last game, where players trade off licks back and forth. Once you finish the game, you'll unlock Pro Face-Off which has both players play the same parts on the same difficulty level, making for a great competition mode. This is fantastic fun, but the new Cooperative mode is even better. One player takes up lead guitar while the other plays either bass or rhythm guitar, depending on which song you've selected. Everything is split between the two players, so both guitarists are working on building up the same pool of Star Power, compiling the same note streak and so forth. When you want to use Star Power, both players need to raise their guitars at the same time, and you're able to actually fail the song, unlike in Face-Off.   The result of all this is that you feel more like you're in an actual band and accompanying each other, and anyone who's been in a real band knows how fulfilling this can feel when everyone nails their parts and a song really comes together. It's awesome stuff. The only thing missing here is some sort of Career mode catered to multiplayer. This is honestly a tad disappointing, especially when you first start the game and want to unlock songs while your friends are begging to play.    As far as the quality and enjoyment of the bass and rhythm tracks go, most all of them are good fun but some of the slower tracks can be a little boring, especially on bass. This is generally a result of the band's bassist not being too inventive, or a lick that really just holds things together without getting too inventive. For the most part though, these accompanying tracks are great fun to play and work really well to bolster the multiplayer experience.Guitar Hero II takes everything that made the original game great and cranks it up to 11, maybe even 12. The Practice mode and ability to set individual difficulty levels in multiplayer are fantastic additions that really were our two biggest sticking points last time out. The Cooperative multiplayer is a huge amount of fun, and three buttons chords help take the game's challenge to the next level. RedOctane once again nailed down a fantastic song list, Wave Group Studio again recreated them expertly and Harmonix implemented the tracks perfectly. This is the nearly-perfect sequel to one of our favorite games in basically forever, and it's an absolute must-buy.", "date": "Nov 3, 2006"}
