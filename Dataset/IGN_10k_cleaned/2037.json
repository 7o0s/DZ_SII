For this reason, the highly touted PlayStation 2 version of Madden NFL 2001 undoubtedly caused hundreds of thousand of college football fans across the nation to be hopeful of day that EA would bring its NCAA franchise to this powerful new next-generation console.  Well, that day has finally come and the long wait has been completely worth it, as EA has managed to construct a game in the form of NCAA Football 2002 that is arguably the best college football videogame that has ever graced a console. While based partly on the Madden NFL 2001 engine, it features a large number of improvements in various aspects of the game and has been loaded with practically every single imaginable feature that a diehard sports fanatic would expect to see in a videogame.  Play Modes & Options And so it's here, with the game's feature set that we'll start off the review. If you've ever played a football game from EA Sports, you already know to expect more features and gameplay modes than you'll get from anyone else's product. While it's completely debatable as to whether or not Madden NFL 2001 is a better or worse playing football game than NFL2K1, there would be no point in arguing which game had the most bells and whistles as Madden was the clear champion in this arena.   That said, EA Sports has been able to top what they did in last year's Madden with this incarnation of NCAA Football 2002. Not only does the game have the common Exhibition and Season play modes, both of which allow you to play as any of the currently available teams, but there's a nice Practice mode that gives users a chance to get a good feel of the playbooks and an insanely deep Dynasty Mode.  The Dynasty Mode is clearly the meat and potatoes of this game and helps give the game an almost limitless amount of replay value. Players can choose to use up to 12 coaches and teams during a single Dynasty, so you and 11 of your closest friends or relatives can partake in a Dynasty at the same time, and it's possible to take any of the available 27 Division I-AA teams and have them take the place of any of the current 117 Division 1-A teams in the game for an added level of challenge.  As is the case with the Single Season play, players can choose to play or simulate any of the games that their team or teams take part in and can check to see the ratings for their coach to see if he's living up to his expectations, which will determine whether or not you'll be able to coach and use this team past his contract period. The only real problem here is that the coach's expectations don't really seem all that varied and are a bit too stiff at times. No Athletic Director would ever expect a coach of the Delaware State Hornets to have winning season two out of three years (against Division 1-A opponents) and win a National Championship one out of three years, and this is was listed when I took over this team. It would've been much more realistic to have a goal like posting a winning record or bowl bid within the first four years.  And for those of you that are more into the management side of things and like to simulate the games, you have the ability to select the offensive and defensive coaching strategy and playbook to be used in the simulated games, with controllable features like the percentage of run versus pass, how conservative or aggressive your play calling will be and how many substitutions will be made.  While all of this is fine and dandy, you won't find the real meat of the Dynasty Mode until after the season is completed and you advance to the off-season. The first thing you'll notice is that as you're checking the list of your parting players, whether graduating seniors or money-grubbing juniors or sophomores, is that there's an option to export your draft class, a feature that you might remember for the latter PlayStation versions of NCAA Football. What this does is takes all of the players that are leaving and save them onto a memory card that can be used with the upcoming version of Madden NFL 2002. Consequently, once you finish your first season in the Franchise mode of the new Madden, you will be able to use this save to draft the real collegiate players instead of the fake players that would be normally created if you didn't have the save file.  What's more, it's possible to import multiple draft classes, so if you decide to play multiple years in both NCAA's Dynasty mode and Madden's Franchise mode, you can have semi-realistic draft opportunities for at least the first two or three NFL drafts in Madden. This feature alone almost doubles the play value and worth of both titles.  Even if you're not planning to pick up Madden and are just into the pageantry of the college football experience, the off-season has a lot of stuff to offer. For one, it features an intense recruiting process that allows you to try and recruit these randomly created players from across the country or enter you own created prospects that you might not be able to convince to come to your school.  The recruiting process is five weeks long and depending on the recruiting budget of your school, which will be large if you're coaching a school like Notre Dame and coming off a National Championship or small if you're coaching the Cal Bears and coming off a two win season, you'll be given only a limited amount of points that must be used to split up head and assistant coach visits and calls. Basically, Head Coach visits use up the most points and will increase your chances of nabbing a top prospect, while a simple call by the assistant coach won't have much pull but might be needed if you're on a limited budget and need to make sure you use up all of your scholarships.  What really makes this aspect of the game stand out is that it's done amazingly so amazingly well. During this process you have instant access to State Prospects for your state and any other of your choosing, your current targeted players, the National Top 100, all prospects, all of the prospects that are interested in your school and a list of your returning players and their respective classes, so you know exactly what needs should be addressed.  The craziness doesn't end there, either, as you're also given detailed stats on each of the prospects including things like his height, weight, 40 time, grade point average, vertical, bench press, squat, hometown, caliber, interest level in your school and his current top 3 schools. And once you go after a certain kid, you're given some additional feedback as to whether or not he's meeting, exceeding or falling below his expectations and additional insight as to whether or not you can get him to commit, so you can decide whether or not to keep after him or give up and try for another athlete.  It's kind of a game within a game and for any longtime college football fan that sees the recruiting process and whether not the 6'7~ 315lb prospect out of your hometown stays at a local school or heads on to greener pastures elsewhere is the most exciting aspect of college sports, it's quite simply worth owning the game for.  Beyond the recruiting, the off-season schedule also allows you to view the training results to see how much your players have improved, which seem to be at least partially tied to how well you use them in the season and how good your team performed. You can also decide on what players to redshirt, set the depth charts and then finally move onto the next season. Hey, and if all of this is just stuff that you don't want to deal with it, you can let the computer handle all of it for you.  Stat Tracking & Extras To go along with all of the included play modes and in-depth Franchise mode, EA has once again given the game just about every single stat tracking capability that one would want to see in a football title. Not only is just about every single possible stat that can be tracked recorded for every single player on all 117 teams in the current Dynasty, but career stats are also kept as you continue on to each subsequent year.   So, if you have a halfback that stays for four years, you can see just how many yards he's carried over his career without having to keep track of it yourself -- and this isn't just for your team, but for every single team and player in your Dynasty.  Moreover, the game also keeps records of the Coach's Top 25, AP Top 25, BCS Rankings, all the Bowl games, weekly awards, the list of All-Americans, and yearly individual honors for such things as the Heisman Trophy, quarterback of the year, and more.  The stat tracking is just so enormously in-depth and this characteristic also seen in the roster management capabilities that lets you set the depth chart for each position and particular subs at each position for every single available formation.   As if the Franchise mode and the ability to have your stats for your entire career weren't already enough to keep you playing this game well into the next year, NCAA Football 2002 also offers up a cool take on the ever-popular Madden Cards in the form of its Campus Challenge Cards. Just like was the case with the Madden Cards, players can earn points by completing different tasks like holding the CPU under 7 points, gaining 100 yards receiving with one player or 200 passing yards by two different players in one game, and can use these points to buy new cards, which consist of things like team boosts, cheats, new stadiums, historic teams and fantasy teams. With the last three being especially cool because they open up secret teams like a mascot team comprised of nothing but the Texas Longhorn mascot or the 1992 All American team.  Even though this might seem like fluff to some, it's a great way to extend the replay value of the game once you've mastered the AI on all difficulty levels because it gives you added incentive to play the game after you'd normally have moved on to something else. Likewise, the game also keeps track of season records, with the real NCAA records for yearly rushing yards, passing yards, receptions and other stats listed as the ones to beat. So, if you wish to try and beat Barry Sanders 2628 rushing yards and 37 rushing touchdowns, Ty Detmer's 5188 passing yards in a single season or David Klinger's 1990 passing TD total of 54, it's yours for the taking. Again, it's something that might seem pointless to some but for someone that used to keep his players' stats by hand and try to beat these records back when games didn't keep track of anything, it's a dream come true.  Gameplay All of this, the deep Dynasty Made, excellent recruiting feature, comprehensive stat tracking and record keep, would all be completely useless if the game didn't have the gameplay to back it all up. Thankfully, what we have here is based on the stellar Madden 2001 gameplay engine with some tweaks and improvements, so if you're a fan of how Madden played and controlled last year, you'll be more than pleased with what we're given here. On the contrary, if your opinion of Madden was that it moved too slow or that player control was a bit too floaty for your liking, then you'll also be disappointed with NCAA, as it has the exact same basic feel of Madden.  The again, if you happen to share my opinion and believe that the so-called floaty control is a faithful representation of real-life physics such as player momentum and speed, then you're going to feel right at home with this game. The only foreseeable problem is that you might find the control and gameplay to be a little bit too much like Madden. So much so that pretty much all of the same types of plays and specific money plays that you used effectively in Madden 2001 can be used here with the same success rate in NCAA. The only real difference is that with the greater discrepancies between teams, you'll find that some money plays that work great with Oklahoma against Florida State won't work nearly as well if you're taking Yale against the Seminoles on the game's harder settings.  The only discernable difference with the passing game is that there are no longer as many unrealistic one-handed grabs because there are lots of new two-handed catch animations. Otherwise, the timing of the passes, the types of pass patterns that usually work and the mechanics are all completely unchanged. This is too bad because this is one of the areas where EA Sports' football games really have some room for improvement, because it doesn't really accurately represent the timing aspect that's so important in having an effective passing attack in the real deal. It does give you the option to use route-based passing and this helps get past some of the issues, but still doesn't completely deal with the need to be able to pass to locations, lead your receivers and time your passes.   The CPU defenders do appear to react to your play calling, though, as if you constantly throw quick outs to your wide outs, they'll bring up their corners, while if you keep going long you can expect to have them drop back and have your deep patterns covered tightly. Either way, if you have a speedy bunch of receivers against anything less than a grade ~A~ defensive backfield, you can expect certain money patterns like outs and corner patterns to be open on a fairly consistent basis.   Whereas the passing game has its failings, the running game is almost flawless. The first thing you'll notice is that the offensive line work is much improved and you'll be able to distinguish holes and cutback lanes much better than before. The player control is also really responsive and it's easy to make quick cuts, jukes, spins and stiff arms if your thumb isn't stuck on the speed burst button too much. And thanks to the pressure sensitive buttons of the Dual Shock 2 controller, you're given the ability to do different levels of jukes and spin moves, which is especially important when moving up to the game's top difficulty setting. Moreover, the previously mentioned floaty or momentum-based aspect of the player movement really lends itself to some highly realistic running situations where you can use the momentum of the defender to your advantage and set up blocks and cut lanes by what you do with your running back.  It's in this area that you'll also find the biggest enhancement or addition over what you were presented with in Madden -- the option running attack. This is one of the most exciting aspects of the college game and it's probably never been done better before than it's done here in NCAA Football 2002. Running the option attack takes a lot of practice and leaves you open to a lot of mistakes, but is well worth the time and effort. You have full control over the option and can even handoff the ball to the fullback as part of a triple option, pitch it out to the end on an option reverse or just handle it the standard way with just your QB, the option back and your mad skills.   My biggest grievances with the game deal with when you're on the defensive side of the ball. The defensive line play, for one, has the same basic problems that were seen in both EA's Madden and Visual Concept's NFL2K1, which is the fact that your player would often get sucked into blocks. It's not nearly as bad as it was in those two titles, but still a problem worth mentioning. Similarly, the response time of doing the swim moves or spins seem a bit lagging and if you don't time the respective moves perfectly, you'll find that you'll get stuck in blocks too easily. Because of this, the best route to the quarterback once again seems to be to take a very wide stance and speed rush around the end because you won't get sucked into any blocks and by simply rushing deep past the line, you'll likely force the QB to move laterally or into the pocket, which will in turn make him a little more erratic and more prone to a bad pass.  Things are a little better when trying to defend passes, as you're not put into over-the-top animations that take you out of the play as much, which was often the case in Madden, but there's still a lot to be desired here. Case in point would be the way that players are selected when you switch control once a pass is thrown. It seems that whenever you would like to switch to the player in between the quarterback and the intended receiver, it'll switch you first to the defender behind the receiver causing you to have to use him to try and break up the pass, opening the chance for a big play if you make a mistake, or just let the receiver catch the ball before you make the hit. The optimum situation would be to switch to the player that's in position to intercept or deflect the pass without having to make the risky play on the ball and the only way to do this in the game is to press the switch player button twice quickly and in quick pass plays, you can't really do this quick enough and still make a play on the ball.  You will also notice that even the best of cornerbacks have stone hands and will drop about 95% of all passes that they put two-hands on. It's understandable that the developers wouldn't want the game to have an unrealistic amount of interceptions and if they caught a more realistic percentage of passes that they got two hands-on that we'd probably see a dozen or so INTs per game, but that just means that the passing game on the whole could use some tweaks in order to make it more realistic.  The defensive aspect of the game also suffers from the same thing just about every single football game ever made has a problem with and that's a realistic balance with the rushing and passing stats put up against you. Unless you're playing as one of the game's worst teams, you can expect to finish each season with the best rushing defense in the league because teams will often abandon the running game too early or will run plays that just aren't all that effective. You can go into the AI settings and tweak the computer's RB Ability and Run Blocking to find a nice balance, but it still feels a bit off kilter even if you jack these settings all the way to the max.  Graphics As far as I can tell, the graphics engine for NCAA Football 2002 is essentially an enhanced version of the already solid Madden NFL 2001 engine and a few step below the new 2002 engine for Madden. But instead of the shorter, thicker players that just about everyone in the world complained about, most of the players in NCAA 2002 are a bit more slender and accurately proportioned, while still keeping on enough muscle mass so you know that these are highly-trained athletes and not just some average Joe off of the street.   Even though what we have here is petty much Madden 2001, there have been a handful of very noticeable improvements made other than just the body sizes. Most notably is the addition of an assortment of new player animations in just about every single facet of the game. The transitional frames of animation are much more fluid this time around and you'll encounter a lot of player movements and motions that you haven't seen before. No longer will the ridiculous one-handed sticky hand grab be the most common reception, as there are a handful of new catch animations.   Additionally, the tackles have been tightened up a lot thanks to much improved collision detection where the player models actually touch each other instead of having that invisible force field around them like in Madden 2001. This minor little correction and the new tackle animation really help push the game's level of believability up a few notches, that's for sure.  Another area of the visuals that you'll also notice some improvements is with the texture quality of the uniforms. While the jerseys already looked great in Madden 2001, you'll see a marked improvement here in NCAA 2002, as the mesh jerseys have an even better sense of depth and shape to them. The background details have also been upped a few notches as the developers have added more players and bystanders to the sidelines and there are more people that can be ran into and knocked over.  You'll also see team mascots on the sidelines, such as the University of Miami's Ibis and the University of Washington's Husky, and these guys are every bit as detailed as the players, if not even more so in some areas. The mascots are all fully animated and the texture quality of their outfits are pretty darn detailed, so much so that it looks like real costumes and not just some texture around a polygonal model.  The stadiums are also highly detailed and contain many famous background elements from the real areas. While you won't be able to see Touchdown Jesus in South Bend,   Despite the fact that you'll see countless improvements in NCAA 2002's visuals over Madden 2001, there are still some areas where it failed to develop. The freaky eyes are still here, even if they aren't quite as glossy, and the intense slowdown during the close-up replays is as horrible as ever. While the game seems to move at a fairly consistent 60 frames per second from the snap of the ball to the whistle calling a play dead, most of the in between scenes get obnoxiously choppy. Since it isn't during gameplay it doesn't really matter all that much in the whole scheme of things, but it's still a major annoyance nevertheless.  In the face of these graphical flaws, NCAA 2002 is still the best-looking football videogame currently on the market. Sure, it'll only hold this honor until Madden NFL 2002 or NFL2K2 hits the streets, but until then, NCAA 2002 is the rightful holder of that designation.  Sound This is the area where NCAA 2002, and sports games in general, really need to see some major improvements. While the commentary job by Nessler, Corso and Herbstreit is generally upbeat and flows well, it just doesn't have the variety to support a game that will be played by many for weeks on end. Corso's Madden-esque comments will often repeat during single games and none of what they comment on is tied into what's happening in the current season or the player's career.  For instance, Corso will often make a statement suggesting that a player should be considered for the Heisman. While this seemed befitting after a 38 yard scamper by Clinton Portis that brought his yearly rushing total to 1858 yards, he also said it after my seldom-used fullback Kyle Cobia got his very first carry and rushed for 28 yards in the final game of the season.  Maybe it's too much to ask, but it'd be nice if the commentary were tied more into what's happening in the game and in the season. If my half back is only 10 yards away from the single season rushing record, this should be brought up, and if my Heisman-candidate quarterback throws an interception down in the red zone, the commentators should mention that he's hurting his chances.   Furthermore, when playing in a bowl game or, better yet, a National Championship game, there should be some brand new commentary, and there's not really anything extra offered here. After winning a National Championship, the crew will give you the same basic speech that you were given after an early season blowout win of some Division I-AA team.   Not all here is bad, though, and the game's audio does have its bright spots. As far as I can tell, just about all of the real college fight songs are accurately represented here and the crowd noise is pretty tied into the game. And just like was the case with Madden NFL 2001, when you put in an edited player's name that had a voice recorded for it, the announcer will say the name instead of just the player's number. This seems to work with most of the major college players, too, and not just common names like Smith, Williams, Green, etc.   It might not seem like a big thing, but hearing ~Suggs with the eight yard gain~ is a lot more interesting than ~Number 22 with the eight yard gain.~ While I haven't obviously heard every name, but the chances seem quite good that if your player is All-American quality, such as a Lee Suggs or Ken Dorsey, then his name will be part of the game's audio. Whether or not NCAA Football 2002 is a game that you should buy is really a decision that you and only you can make (yes, this seems like a cop out, but hear me out). The game plays just like Madden with some enhancements, so if you didn't like Madden NFL 2001 and the way it controlled and played, then you will not like NCAA Football 2002 because even with its improvements, it still plays like Madden did last year for the most part. On the other hand if you like the way Madden played and has always played, then you know what to expect from NCAA in this area and if you're looking for a college football game then this is a complete no brainer -- NCAA Football 2002 is a must-own game that you won't be able to live without. My personal opinion is that this is the best college football game ever made and has more replay value than you could ever hope for in a $50 purchase. I, for one, expect to get more than 200 hours out of this baby and will be playing it long after the Miami Hurricanes wins this year's National Championship.", "date": "Jul 24, 2001"}
