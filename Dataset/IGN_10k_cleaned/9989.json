Street Fighter II is Capcom's legendary fighting game, a genre-defining title that was a classic in its own right but then extended its influence by appearing again and again, over the years, in a variety of remixed iterations. The subsequent installments in the series always tweaked the gameplay, or increased the speed, or added more characters  an occurrence first revisited here on the Virtual Console last summer when Street Fighter II Turbo debuted for download in the Wii Shop. It was the second time the game had hit the service, the first having been the original Street Fighter II: The World Warrior on Christmas Day of 2006. And now we're offered a third (and likely last) version of the game  Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers. The third time's the charm.   This version is the best to come to the Virtual Console so far because it offers the most depth, most options and most playable characters of any take on SF2 seen to this point. The first Street Fighter II shipped with only eight fighters. Street Fighter II Turbo added the ability to play as the bosses, making the total roster rest at 12. But this time around four all-new combatants have entered the arena, and Super Street Fighter II finalizes its lineup at an impressive 16 different selections. Adding to the roster is the primary focus of this revision, and the new fighters are a welcome addition to the established fighting formula.   Cammy, the British Red Beret, is the most notable and memorable of the new four faces thanks to her continued popularity over the years after her introduction in this title  she fights with a spinning, kicking style that sees her whirling through the air like a drill for her main special move. Fei Long is Capcom's version of Bruce Lee, a Hong Kong native and cinematic martial arts master who can set opponents aflame with his rising Dragon Kick. Dee Jay is a Jamaican brawler known to celebrate his victories with festive maraca performances, and T. Hawk is a Native American whose large size doesn't stop him from soaring through the sky like the bird of prey he's named after.   T. Hawk blocks Dee Jay's projectile attack ... with his face.  Each of the four new characters also arrive with their own new stages in their home countries, and all around the additions just help to flesh out the game. Street Fighter fans in the early '90s had already seen plenty of the original eight characters and the bosses before, and it was time for something new  but the older characters weren't forgotten in this release, either. Many of them received new moves, animations and gameplay tweaks themselves, like Ryu's Red Fireball and Ken's Dragon Punch now being enveloped in a column of flame.   The one thing that Super Street Fighter II changed that could be seen as a negative is the overall tempo of the gameplay. Street Fighter II Turbo had amped up the acceleration quite a bit, making fights faster and more frenetic than they'd ever been before. But oddly, rather than keeping the speed upgrade seen there for this follow-up, Super Street Fighter II took it out. The gameplay here is much slower than in Turbo. Still a bit faster than the original, but definitely slower than Turbo.   There's a group of fans who still take offense to that fact, and still stalwartly declare that Turbo was the better version of Street Fighter II on the SNES because of its sense of speed alone. That opinion's a little extreme in my view  you sacrifice speed here, sure, but the four new fighters and stages, the revisions to established characters' moves and the multitude of other extra options more than make up for that one drawback. The extra options in particular add a lot of depth, as you can set up tournaments, create best-of-3 matches where different characters are used in each round, tweak the difficulty and button configurations, play a full-on elimination mode where you systematically take out an opposing player's lineup of characters one at a time and more. There's just a lot of different ways to play here, and the lasting value offered up by Super makes it hard to feel too bad for the lost sense of speed from Turbo.Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers is very likely the last version of Street Fighter II that will come to the Virtual Console, as it's the last version of the game made in the '90s for the SNES. It's possible that Capcom will present the SNES version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 at some point in the future, too, but that game's part of the Alpha series and differs quite a bit from this earlier design. So that makes this version the last of II, and the best of II on the VC. If you haven't yet spent 800 Wii Points on any of the different Street Fighter II downloads, this is the one to get. It took them over a year and we had to wait through two past editions of the same experience, but this third time is, at last, the charm.", "date": "Feb 7, 2008"}
