That RPG was none other than Final Fantasy Legend.   Features Role Playing Game  Battery Back-Up Three Character Classes For Game Boy (black and white)  Gamers familiar with the Final Fantasy series will notice that Final Fantasy Legend doesn't fit the Final Fantasy mold.  And in fact, the game had nothing to do with Final Fantasy.  Released in Japan as Makaitoushi SaGa, it was the first installment of the SaGa series (better known as Romancing SaGa).   For whatever reason, the Final Fantasy name was used for the game's American release.   Since it was the very first RPG on what was then an untested new platform, much attention was focused on the game and Square did not disappoint.  Final Fantasy Legend not only transferred the RPG franchise to the small screen, it did it with style.  The gameplay is ambitious, using an intricate ~class system~ based on Humans, Mutants, and Monsters.  Players are given the choice of these three classes at the start of the game, giving them the ability to mix and match different classes into their party, creating a dynamic party system that is far more interesting and customizable than most of Square RPGs.   The three classes have their own individual strengths.  Humans for example, are not good spell casters but are the most powerful fighters.  Therefore humans should be equipped with physical weapons.  Mutants on the other hand are excellent in magic and should be equipped with magic books.   And finally, the monsters are unlike humans or mutants as they gain strength through evolution. Monsters are by far the highest maintenance class of all.  They evolve as they consume the carcasses of fallen enemies, and gamers would have to make a conscious choice on the type of monster they want in their party.  For novices, this conscious choice is pretty much a leap of faith, as it is somewhat difficult to find the right type of monster for a specific party.  A player who has invested time into raising the skill of a monster may suddenly find it is unsuitable for their party. Considering the fact that Final Fantasy Legend fields some of the most difficult enemies in an RPG, having a weak monster in a team could mean certain failure.   Therefore, beginning players would often have to forfeit their hard work to find another monster in its place, creating much frustration.  Even more frustrating however, are the countless random battles in the game.  Random battles aren't a new RPG concept, but battles to the extent and frequency found in Final Fantasy Legend is.  The battles occur so often, and the monsters so powerful, that walking a distance becomes a chore, and for the unprepared gamer, it could mean certain destruction.  A feature that might have proved interesting is the game's novel item system.  Magic books, and weapons wear down with use, and would have to be repaired or replaced by the gamer.  This adds a certain element of realism to the game and rewards the good party managers with continued success.  However, the flaw in the system is that it could prove fatal to the party.  Stuck deep in a dungeon with no weapons and no cash (and the game constantly have you strapped for cash), gamers would be better advised to simply restart from the last saved point rather than watch the game decimate the adventuring party in a protracted series of fights.   Another problem in Final Fantasy Legend is its visuals.  While Game Boy was and has never been known for its graphics, the game already looked somewhat dated when it debuted on Game Boy more than ten years ago.  There are almost no background palettes to speak of, and dungeons could turn into a tedious maze of bland walls and floors. Perhaps the game's only saving grace is the detailed sprites of monsters the stirring score.  For Final Fantasy and Square buffs, Final Fantasy Legend simply cannot be missed. While not without its flaws, the game is still compelling RPG with a complex gameplay system and a solid soundtrack. This is the beginning of an epic saga of RPGs on the Game Boy, and if you're looking to pick up the trilogy, be sure to pick this one up as well. It should also be noted that Final Fantasy Legend was first released in 1990 by Squaresoft USA.  The Game Boy rights was later picked up by Sunsoft in 1998 for a re-release and that is the copy I reviewed. And for the record, the games are identical, even though Sunsoft claimed on the box that the game was for use with Game Boy Color, it doesn't seem to be special colorized in anyway.", "date": "Jun 13, 2000"}
