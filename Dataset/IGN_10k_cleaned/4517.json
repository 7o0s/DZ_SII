After bathing in the money made from their Medal of Honor games, several of EA's top programmers defected and created a WW2 shooter to call their own: Call of Duty. And thusly, publisher Activision made a boatload of money. Now, the Big A has enlisted Mforma to create a to-go portion of the popular shooter. Is it worthy of the name? Or does the game live in infamy?  Features:  Control a squad of three Four different classes of troops Top-down perspective  Call of Duty has a really solid angle to it -- other than just being a really, really good game. You proceeded to kick the crap out of the Nazi Wehrmacht all over Europe, but as three different Allied soldiers. The go-go version of Call of Duty allows you to play as three characters, but not from different nations. Instead, you must choose from different combat specialties:  Snipers: Long-range shooting capabilities Medics: Heal other soldiers Engineers: Demolitions talents (blowin' up stuff like tanks) Squad Commanders: More HP than the other troops  How successful you are at the numerous missions in Call of Duty depends on whether or not you bring the right troops into battle. Before each mission, you are given a complete briefing -- nobody is sent into the field blind. However, once you make your career selections, you cannot switch your team out while playing -- only between missions.  What you can do, though, is switch the position of your troops. You only control the soldier in the lead. The other officers follow your lead, as well as heed your commands. For example, when enemy fire is heavy, you can tell your mates to take cover -- and they do so. This preserves their life for later use, but it really leaves you hanging out there.  The action switches from FPS to top-down, 3rd person perspective. Naturally, this does dampen that ~you are there~ approach that made the PC version of Call of Duty so compelling -- but cellphones really aren't capable of good 3-D just yet. Now that you can look down on the field, you have a greater advantage of seeing incoming enemy troops well before your soldiers encounter them.  The game is actually somewhat difficult -- not that we're complaining. So many handset games are an absolute breeze to complete, whereas Call of Duty actually has some serious longevity to it. Enemy troops possess a relatively decent level of intelligence. And if they think they have the upper hand, they are merciless -- ventilating your squad with machine gun fire from all angles.  Where Call of Duty does stumble, though, is in the visual department. Nobody ius expecting a miracle from a handset game, but this is one drab looking war. Browns and grays everywhere -- which is fine on a console where there are plenty of shades to differentiate objects, as well as lots of polygons to splash them on. But on the cell screen, it just looks dull. The soldiers are tiny, but at least their stats are easy to read against the ~blah~ backdrops.  Call of Duty does, however, try for some interesting audio. The opening theme sounds muted and scratchy, like a wartime record dug up in grandpa's attic. And instead of attaching sound effects to every solider on the field -- which is impossible on a handset right now -- the game loops canned audio, like machine gun fire. The effort is appreciated, but it's strange when nobody on-screen is shooting, yet you hear plenty of action elsewhere. Makes you want to play whatever is going on off-screen. Call of Duty is solid effort from Mforma. It takes serious stones to try and port a hugely popular, and stunningly gorgeous, PC game to a handset where so much will be inescapably lost in the translation. But they pull it off to some extent. The visuals may be no USO show, but the game play is tight -- the control is good, the mission goals varied, and the AI quite well-done. If you've had a hankering to kick Axis arse all over Europe, now's your chance.", "date": "Mar 5, 2004"}
