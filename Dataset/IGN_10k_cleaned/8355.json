The nonsensical knee-jerk sequel -- not so much. However, the instantly recognizable nature of the MiB name and logo is worth hard currency in the mobile landscape, where fates are sealed by a publisher's ability to spin and sell a game within the space of a pathetic twelve characters. And so nobody could blame Reaxion for grabbing a license that is definitely past its prime, but still on the pop culture radar.   The goal of Alien Assault is to, as goes the credo of the mysterious organization, protect earth from the scum of the universe. As special agent Jay, you get access to the MiB hardware catalog for taking out scores of aliens that are wreaking havoc on the streets and sewers of the city. However, in a nice move, you don't exactly have to take on the levels in a particular order. Using the MiB HQ as a world hub, you can choose your missions as so desired. MiB scientists and friendly aliens will tell you of suspicious activity in the city, and if you think you can take the heat, you accept the mission and head out.   The actual game mechanics aren't exactly inventive. Alien Assault uses the three-quarter-view action-puzzle template. You move boxes to reach ledges. You collect stuff in maze-like levels. You shoot barrels. And you take on alien hordes with your guns. But the action is punctuated by occasionally using the Neuralizer on citizens that have seen too much. If an alien is in the open and spotted by a mere earthling, you must zap their memory before they lose their minds... or worse, go to the press. In fact, the best way to blow a mission is to not perform a mind-wipe in time; it's actually pretty hard to get shot up in Alien Assault.   At fifteen levels, MiB is worth a couple hours of game play. That's not a bad value, especially when you throw in online leaderboards for posting your best level times and a arena mode. Arena drops you into a short series of landscapes with the goal of wiping out wave after wave of incoming aliens. But the problem with Alien Assault is that, save for the Neuralizer trick, there's just nothing here that you haven't done before -- on games that are over two years old.   However, it must be noted that Alien Assault is a nice-looking game. Reaxion did not score actor likeness rights -- no big loss on the smallest screen, right? -- but they did a good job capturing the necessary elements of the MiB universe. The HQ scenery is dead-on, for example. The city environments feature a solid amount of color and detail. The alien sprites are ugly. (That's a compliment.) And the game does make use of some good audio.  Men in Black: Alien Assault is just too paint-by-numbers to be truly enjoyable. Nothing here is broken or unplayable, it's just that the game settles too comfortably into some of the hoariest pieces of the action-puzzle formula. Reaxion has done a solid job with the visuals -- easily the strongest part of the game -- and the Neuralizer mechanic is clever. But the rest of the game is just to me-too to recommend to anybody by the most ardent MiB fan.", "date": "Apr 10, 2007"}
