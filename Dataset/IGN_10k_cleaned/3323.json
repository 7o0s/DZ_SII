I mean, seven distinctly different superhero characters, each with his or her own special abilities -- give this license to the right development team and the game has tons of potential. The game that Midway and Saffire designed, however, feels like an incredible rush-job of a Game Boy Advance development. It's challenging and somewhat fun in its own way, but the game could have been so much better on the GBA given the proper focus. Features Seven controllable characters 12 levels Cartridge save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  Seven of the most powerful superheroes on the planet join forces in the Cartoon Network series Justice League, and in Justice League: Injustice for All, players must take these seven through the paces of a situation that threatens the world and learn of Lex Luthor's evil plot. The game breaks down into twelve different levels that branch off into locations all over the planet; each level features a pairing of two different Justice League heroes. Players will have to utilize each characters' strengths and weaknesses in these levels, switching off between the two to take out the different enemy threats, grab the keycard, destroy the hidden device in each area, and fight one of the eight different members of the Injustice League waiting for them at the end of almost every level.  The problem with Justice League is its overall feeling of a rushed development. It doesn't look a lot like the animated series because of the direction the artists went with the game; instead of hand-animating sprites, the designers instead 3D modeled all of the characters and objects in the game, rendering these sprites at several different positions. What gamers get are clunky movements for the animation that doesn't accurately represent the cartoon series' art and animation. Backgrounds vary in quality, but in some places you can see seams where the artists repeat certain tile patters, almost looking like an amateur wallpapering job in specific locations.  The level designs are relatively uninspired and unimaginative, especially for a game that supposedly encourages the utilization of two different, specific characters and their abilities to get through the areas. What could have been a superhero equivalent of Lost Vikings ends up a somewhat mindless action-brawler with the occasional platform-hopping and Mario-style token collection. Some levels have unfair hazard placements, such as nearly unavoidable stalagmites falling from the ceiling, or spike floors that refuse to disappear. And for a brawler, the game doesn't have forgiving controls or collision detection; players will have to be spot-on with their kicks or punches, because the game doesn't allow any sort of corrective movement while the character's in the middle of his animation. It's a shame that the designers didn't put any thought into the boss battles, either; most of these end-level challenges can be completed with full health, simply walking up to the bad guys and attacking until their power drops to zero. Once players figure out the control and animation quirks of each character, the game's admittedly a bit of fun and is somewhat on the challenging side...but then, 12 levels isn't a whole lot and it's over relatively soon after the game begins.   Implementation of Justice League's storyline is also a bit sloppy; cutscenes are supposed to unveil the plot through conversations between characters, but for some reason the designers give players the ability to cycle through these text boxes with a simple press of the A button, making the game's story a mystery for those who have a habit of holding down the action button to simply speed along the slow animation of the scrolling text. The license has a lot of promise because there are eight different superheroes that feature unique superhuman abilities, and it's potential creative gold for game designers to work a idea around each of the strengths and weaknesses of the Justice League members. But Saffire's design just reeks of a development team rushed to meet a deadline, damn the quality of the game. The art and animation can't compare to the television series, and the potential for some really clever level designs are lost in this sloppy brawler with harsh character controls and collision detection that really needs to be tweaked.", "date": "Dec 11, 2002"}
