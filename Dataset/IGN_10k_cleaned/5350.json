Targeting the casual gamer with titles that appeal with simple, easy-to-pick-up gameplay is a sound strategy, and their latest ~sports~ title nails the premise. Foosball is a game familiar to everybody, as tables could be found everywhere from high school cafeterias to dormitories, from employee break rooms to sports bars. And now the psuedo-sport where it truly is all in the wrist in coming to a small screen near you.   Features:   All teams based on European football clubs  Two play modes   Everybody knows Foosball already. The gaming table is dressed up like a soccer field. Rows of plastic players are skewered on metal bars with feet permanently frozen in the kick position. Each end has a goal, protected by a single player. Using reflexes of steel, you must spin the bars to advance the tiny soccer ball across the ~field~ to score goals.   It's a deceptively simple premise, as any beginning foosball player can tell you that the seemingly easy game has a steep learning curve. And if you're playing against a pro, abandon all hope. That's where Sorrent succeeds with their digital Foosball. Not only does shrinking the field to just the real estate of a cell screen make the game a little more manageable for beginners, but it smartly keeps the ~players~ closest to the ball active.   Foosball would have been a miserable failure if you had to manually select which bar you wanted to spin to kick the ball. Instead, Foosball automatically highlights the bar closest to the action so you can move, kick, and remain concentrated on getting the right angles to ~kick~ the ball and move it downfield. Does that strip away some of foosball's essence? Yes, but Sorrent has one more trick up its sleeve to make up for the streamlining.   The game is fully loaded with teams based on real soccer clubs from Europe and the United States. For example, if you want a team with real kicking power, you select Manchester or Chelsea. Development included input from a real-world soccer fanatic, and the fleshed-out AI adds an exciting wrinkle. Each team has individual traits like passing, speed, and power that actually affects the in-game action.   Foosball features three difficulty levels: Amateur, Semi-Pro, and Pro. There are two game modes: Exhibition and Cup. In Exhibition, you can select two teams to play with from any club where the Cup mode offers ladder tournaments against teams in the same division. There's no World Cup, per se, but Foosball certainly does a decent job recreating such contests.   Now, Foosball isn't exactly a looker. Foosball tables themselves aren't exactly known for visual flourishes, but Foosball faithfully recreates a foosball table -- and the uniforms and looks of the real-world teams and players. It's a nice touch.  Just like Sorrent intended, Foosball is a great download for a casual gamer. It's streamlined play -- thanks to the automatic bar highlighting -- makes it far more accessible than the real thing to beginners. But advanced foosball players will find real depth in Foosball, thanks to its real-world soccer teams and talents.", "date": "Nov 25, 2004"}
