Such a notion forms the crux of any team sport like hockey, football, or soccer. But let's imagine, for a moment, that you introduce guns to professional sports. Now, outfit one team in futuristic body armor, call in a biomechanical alien race known as the Strogg, expand the field of play to a vast reach of terrain, and drop in tanks and attack helicopters. More or less, this is the essence of Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, and its ability to keep that team versus team competitive spirit intact is why it succeeds.   Any who played Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory back in 2003 with be instantly familiar with Quake Wars. The Allies are now the GDF, the Axis suffered more of a rough transition, becoming the monstrous Strogg. Pick one of five classes on each side after hopping in a server. Earn experience toward more class, weapon, or vehicle abilities by using your skills and blasting bullets into enemy flesh. Work with your squad to blow up structures, escort vehicles, and hack shield generators. Win matches so you can type ~gglol~ ad nauseam on the post-match rankings screen, much to the delight of your squadmates and chagrin of the defeated.    Maps are large but varied and each objective, of which there are generally three per map, alters the front lines of battle. The game transitions smoothly between the various phases of combat, from large-scale open-field fighting, to base defense, to fast-paced corridor conflict. To be successful you'll need to pay attention to which classes will be the most useful as the nature of the conflict mutates. Hit Tab and see your team doesn't have a medic while trying to defend an indoor computer console? Switch over to the Medic class immediately. Find enemy engineers have set up a nearly impenetrable perimeter of anti-vehicle and anti-personnel turrets? Switch to field ops and call in artillery strikes, air bombardments, or an orbital laser.   Unless everyone in the server is an abysmal excuse of a player, one man isn't going to make that much of a difference in this game. For instance, you could have the best rocket soldier around, capable of targeting and obliterating Strogg tanks and airships within seconds of appearing on the battlefield, but it matters little if nobody's there to head for the objective while the enemy reels. If you've a group of field ops on your team with a great sense of battle, calling in air strikes and artillery shells with a heartening regularity, all can crumble in seconds if the enemy targets their deployable structures. You need engineers to back them up, repair the cannons they've called into battle when damage is inflicted, and ensure your team's offense never falters.   You may see the vehicles and scope of battle and instantly think, ~oh this is Battlefield.~ It's not. There's less of an emphasis on vehicles here, mostly because they're oh so easy to destroy. Stationary turrets, auto-lock rocket launchers, grenades, and even machine gun bullets (or energy rifles for the Strogg) can make surprisingly short work of any armor. The on-foot soldier is the focus here, made obvious by some of the classes' wide range of complementary abilities.    For instance, Strogg Infiltrators have an Unreal Tournament-like ability to launch a teleport beacon in any direction, letting them easily breach enemy base walls, escape enemy fire, or pop up to a sniper position. They also have flyer drones, little remote bombs strapped with cameras that can be sent out for reconnaissance and then detonated in an enemy's face. Then there's their primary and secondary weapon, grenades, and the Team Fortress-like ability to steal enemy disguises and instant-kill the unwary opposition with a backstab.   It should be obvious from reading this that Quake Wars borrows quite a few elements from other online shooters. At this point in the genre's development, it's almost impossible not to. But even though you'll be occasionally struck with how a feature seems eerily familiar, playing Quake Wars is assuredly a unique experience. It's the result of the strong sense of camaraderie and sense of competition developer Splash Damage was able to promote. It's a great feeling, after minutes of flinging munitions, to finally break through entrenched enemy positions. On a good team, there's a definite sense in this game, between rapid re-spawn waves, that you've got the enemy on the run, that your team is functioning as an efficient, well-oiled machine, and there's a certain sense of pride to be derived from that. It gets even better as your familiarity with the dissimilarities between GDF and Strogg develop. Though both sides' five classes are roughly similar, little differences become apparent with prolonged play, such an the Strogg Technician's ability to turn enemy bodies into spawn points, whereas GDF Medics can call in supply crates.   On the flip side, if your team isn't communicating and unaware of battle conditions, you're going to get utterly smashed. This could be frustrating for new players not using (or unfamiliar with) Ventrilo or Team Speak, as Quake Wars has no integrated voice chat system. It does, however, have a voiced chat system, where you can broadcast a large number of chats to teammates or the server at large. The chat commands are voiced by an enthusiastic human for GDF, or gruff alien for Strogg. And while they're all useful for things like alerting teammates to incoming fire, spotting enemy targets, telling people to switch classes or that you need health packs from a medic, they just can't compare to the amount of information that can be quickly passed back and forth with voice chat.     Another turnoff is the audio / visual package itself. Graphics range from being really impressive, like the snow section on the Slipgate map where a giant alien spire rises into a snow-choked sky, to somewhat drab, like on the Quarry and Outskirts maps. Then it bounces back to beautiful on maps like Volcano or Island where the terrain is blanketed in the sun's flare. Character model animations also seem overly stiff, which is really too bad since the model itself is quite detailed. Quite simply, Quake Wars' overall visual package just isn't that stylish or consistent. The sound is worse off, as many the weapon effects are dull. There's a classic rail gun sound for Strogg snipers, but other than that the rest generally fail to heighten the sense of frenzied battle in which you're constantly embroiled. Voice commands, which you'll often hear during a fight, can be kind of funny when you're on GDF, but they just sound ridiculous for the Strogg. Hearing a Strogg say ~haxored~ or ~5 Earth-minutes remaining~ just doesn't make any sense, and not in a good Adult Swim kind of way. What other kind of minute could a Strogg possibly be referring to? Space-minutes? Stroggos-minutes? How long are those? The Makron is not pleased with this brittle attempt at humor.   For the most part the game will be moving too fast for you to care about the disappointing sound and occasionally ugly graphics. The game's been designed so that every process, from calling in turrets or planting mines to acquiring rocket lock-on or stealing an enemy uniform can all happen within a matter of seconds. One on one firefights can also end rather quickly, since blasts to the head or upper body from any gun inflict far more damage than hits to the legs or lower torso. So, aside from proper teamplay, players' twitch skill makes a difference. We were a little put off by the weapons' feel, which may have something to do with some of the disappointing discharge sounds. They just don't seem powerful enough, like they're made of plastic instead of chunks of fused metal.    Naturally, with all your squadmates yelling out requests for engineers and strikes and defensive buffers, you may expect to become overwhelmed or lost amidst the action. Thankfully there's an extremely helpful icon system in place to let you know exactly where objectives are located, what class is required to complete them, and how far away they are. If you're a Medic, health icons pop up showing exactly where fallen teammates require revives or requests for health packs are being called out. Side-quests, which range from capturing spawn points to dismantling or hacking enemy armor, are displayed as well, helping you to stay focused and prioritize whatever set of objectives are presented to you at any given time. Of course you'll need to learn what the icons mean before you understand how useful they are, something accomplished after a few hours of play.   Oh, and there's a story, presented in text form at the beginning of each map. Don't bother looking at it. An announcer calls out main objectives during battle, and that's as much detail as you need. Aside from the gameplay, there's a robust statistic tracking system in the game, keeping tabs on kills, class use, performance with vehicles, and myriad other numbers. It's a great way to reward the hardcore for extended play sessions, as the rank emblem that changes as you amass more achievements serves as a badge of honor.   If you're one of those FPS fans with an acute distaste for joining up with others online, Quake Wars offers notably intelligent bots to team up with and square off against. These guys will actively complete objectives, drive vehicles, and drop equipment, making some of your offline teams with automated allies better examples of fluid teamwork than the sometimes hopelessly incompatible people thrown together in servers.The formula set forth in Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory in 2003 has evolved rather well with Quake Wars, delivering a distinct gameplay experience centered around team dynamics. It may not be the prettiest game out there or feature the greatest sound effects, but the enjoyable core of gameplay helps keep things interesting as you blast through the twelve well-designed maps. The elaborate persistent statistics system only strengthens the game's already impressive replay value, as it gives you something to work towards aside from in-game objectives. It's not the kind of mass-market gameplay that's going to appeal to every FPS arena fan out there, but it's highly entertaining nonetheless.", "date": "Oct 3, 2007"}
