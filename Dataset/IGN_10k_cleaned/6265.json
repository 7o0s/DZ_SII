Everywhere, that is, except for here. Americans have tried unsuccessfully to put together a soccer organization something like five times now. So it's interesting to note the release of a soccer game in the United States. Perhaps there are enough sports games fans to warrant such a release, but then again, you don't see too many cricket or rugby games, do you?  All of the World Cup games are represented in Goal Storm, and respond according to actual team performance. For example, Brazil is much better than, say, Canada. The game looks good, even if the players are a bit simply designed. The control is solid and relatively intuitive, the only major problem being the placement of the defensive tackle and goal shot on the same button. There's even the obligatory announcer, calling plays and adding that much heralded element of realism to the game, very popular in today's sports games.  Overall, a good sports effort, although the motion-captured polygonal players do look a little bit like monkeys.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
