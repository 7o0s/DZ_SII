Commanding tons of units in formation in large pitched battles on the field is a pretty exciting idea. When you throw in the whole 3D engine thing where you can zoom in and out and see all of the action from every possible angle things can get pretty interesting. Microids and Black Cactus decided to jump into the fray and swing sharp pointy objects around at all of the competition hoping to outdo and outsell some of the others out on the market. And in a lot of the basic underpinnings of their title Warrior Kings, they succeed. But in more than a few others, they didn't.   Warrior Kings is set in a medieval fantasy world with swords, sorcery, battle, resource management and the blurry lines that can sometimes be drawn between good and evil. The story itself actually seemed like it would head down a pretty interesting path. As Artos, son of a noble, you'll see your father murdered by the hardcore followers of the One God, who also happens to be in control of the most powerful state in the land. One by one, nobles that have anything bad to say about the central government have suddenly found themselves being accused of heresy. Your father was one of them. After seeing him murdered and your hometown burned to the ground, it's time for a little bit of revenge. The story chronicles the journey of Artos to the top of the food chain.   Unfortunately, where the story had good beginnings, it plays out more like a history lesson than an involved story. The main characters build no real relation to the game. The only real reason I felt for Artos at all is because I had to keep him alive in each of the battles. As for the rest of the world, I felt more than a little detached from it. While the span of the game has you traveling all over the map to different climates and settings, it's hard to understand the relation they all have to each other. There's little to no growth of the world's background and the tiny bit of character interaction that happens during the in game cutscenes isn't enough to ever get you grounded.   The campaign itself has more than a few problems. First off, it's mighty slow. I ended up wanting to rush through it by speeding up the game, which of course ended up causing me more than a few problems when trying to control battles and micromanage buildings, resources, and my troops. Maps were exceptionally large, and troops were exceptionally slow.   Part of the problem just lies in the maps and how they're designed. Your home base is the only area you'll be able to build barracks or any of the other military units needed to progress through the level. And usually that's miles and miles away from where you need to go to win the scenario. There'll be no forward bases where you can build up your troops in barracks. You'll have to run them all the way across the map. This often had me using only certain troops that could move the fastest, which means cavalry. And the way the games is balanced (one of the brightest points) means you'll need balanced forces to be effective in combat, which therefore means that my armies would very often get chewed up only because I didn't want to wait for my slow ass heavy infantry to make their slow ass way across the map.   The other disappointment with the single player, one that's solved with the multiplayer in some aspects, was that most of the levels just didn't give you the resources or time to build up cities. And the cities are very, very cool. You can build a sprawling medeival metropolis given the time and money. Build up a cool castle. Build up sweeping defenses against any kind of attack. But much of the time you'll find yourself running through maps with a set number of guys, and sometimes will have a time limit to get ready for battle causing you to ditch your castle building altogether.   My last gripe with the single player actually spawns from one of the features I was looking forward to the most. During the course of the single player game, actually very early on, you'll have to make some decisions that will forever effect the course of your game. Depending on these decisions, you'll be given the chance to play for either the Imperials (the religious fanatics of the One God) or the Pagans (the religious fanatics of the many gods). You'll also have the opportunity to decide whether to throw a little bit of renaissance in there as well or whether to be all for one. While the premise is neat, the way the decisions are made are abrupt. In the very first decision you make, you'll end up choosing the greater path of Pagan or Imperial. The problem is, there was no indication that this was the decision I was making. The only reason I was confident about what I was doing was because I had played through the mission before. And unfortunately in the first decision, you'll have to decide whether you want to destroy this pest that's been trying to wipe you out the whole time. I'm pretty sure most people's reactions are going to be to exact some vengeance, meaning that most everyone will go down one particular path without knowing what they were deciding.    Aside from these sorts of failings, the single player also seems to be steeped in some technical difficulties. The load times are pretty steep. This didn't matter a whole lot to me seeing as my computer is all kinds of fast, but those with the minimum and even recommended specs will see some long loads. The framerate also suffered while moving the camera around the large levels without the visuals turned up all the way. This didn't affect gameplay for the most part, but was still an eyesore at times.    Then there were the bugs. My entire computer froze up quite a bit while trying to load up a new level after finishing an old one. It's more than a little frustrating considering you'll need to play through the end of the last scenario again when you load back up to get to the next level. There were some other minor bugs as well that occasionally would cause crashes, but those were much fewer and far between.   If you can get past all of this and get into the multiplayer however, you'll be in for much more of a strategic and tactical treat. First off, instead of having to decide what forces you use before you begin a game, you'll be able to decide this through what buildings you construct down the tech tree. Build a maypole instead of a church and you'll move down the Pagan path... If you feel certain things aren't working, it is possible to change your path entirely by destroying the hinge buildings in the tech tree, so all the way back to your maypole in other words. You can keep all of the shared buildings of course. The way you'll be able to see what you're going up against is to scout about and check out their town. By seeing their manor and their walls and some of the their units, you'll find out which tactics and strategic direction you'll need to balance your forces towards making intelligence a very important part of the game.   Units are balanced very well in the game on all sides. And all sides have just enough of the same and unique units to make battles more than interesting. As I mentioned before, the balancing is based off of the ~combined forces~ theory. So you can't run in with all missile units because cavalry will wipe them up. But you can't run in with all cavalry because heavy infantry will wipe them out. And you can't run in with all heavy infantry because they're all slow ass slow asses and will get wiped out by anything missile firing. And then when you're in battle with all of your troops, maneuvering them into position for flank and side attacks is a must and can make for some seriously entertaining battles when playing against a careful and calculating opponent. When you add in the fun of sieging cities that have been well set up over time, setting up working supply lines and the opportunity to cripple them and even steal the supplies, it's hard not to have more fun. There'll be plenty of fights over outlying villages. There'll be plenty of fighting over the scarce stone and gold patches. There'll be plenty of fighting, period.   Troops for the most part actually act pretty intelligent. Units vulnerable to a certain kind of attack, such as archers not liking hand-to-hand combat with the heavy infantry, will retreat when approached and turn and fire. If they're set up in formation, you'll actually see them fall back in lines to turn and fire, which is pretty neat. Formations also cause half of the problems with pathfinding and AI however. Getting formations to move anywhere but forward can be a pain in the ass and sometimes impossible. If you try to fit a bunch of archers in line formation through a small pass, they won't file through and reform on the other side, they'll just act as one gigantic unit that can't fit through the pass. It's frustrating to have to change them to travel formation or disband them altogether to make them move forward. My other small problem with AI is their total reluctance to disengage from the enemy if you ask them to. The only way you can get them to do this is to hit the flee command. This doesn't give you control over the direction they flee. So if your heavy cavalry are committed in battle and you'd like to regroup them over to the right, you won't really be able to. You'll need to wait for them to flee far enough away and then select them all and tell them where you want to go.  Warrior Kings isn't a bad game by any means. While the single player game isn't entirely un-enjoyable, it could have used a bit more scenario tuning and more work on the story. Where the game really shines is in the tactics and strategy in the multiplayer game. There's plenty to be had here. The main problem with that is that it's hard to find a game. This certainly isn't the most popular game being played over the Net. It's unfortunate, but true. If you can find a game, you'll usually find mostly nice and fun people to play with, which is actually pretty unusual for multiplayer games nowadays.", "date": "May 17, 2002"}
