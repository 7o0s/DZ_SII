Not content with revel in its success, the wireless game maker has taken to the court to unleash a mobile take on b-ball, just in time for the new season. Can JAMDAT translate its winning way from the Astroturf to boards?   Features:   Full NBA license  2-on-2 action  Arcade-style controls  Exhibition and season play   One of the toughest decisions JAMDAT made in NFL was yanking ten players from the field, reducing the number of jugheads from 22 to 14. It made the game much more manageable, and JAMDAT is applying the same formula/logic now the basketball. In the spirit of arcade titans like NBA Jam and the desire to make a cohesive baller with such little real estate, JAMDAT has boiled b-ball down to a 2-on-2 contest. The real testament to JAMDAT's skill in that while this is now technically not ~authentic,~ it bears enough real deal basketball touches to offset the loss.   Besides, does your handset have the processing muscle to run AI routines for nine other players?   JAMDAT utilizes a full NBA license so fans can choose their fave teams from the league's 30 clubs. In addition to this, each team roster is legit, featuring the superstars to love to root for -- where on the court or in court. Shaq, Kobe, Odom, Wallace -- all here and selectable.   Because of its arcade-ish style, JAMDAT Sports NBA 2005 is a fast-moving game. The floor is always alive with action, and thanks to the removal of fouls like three-second violations, there are no free throws. This is actually something we missed, as free throws are actually a pretty big part of the game and often go a long way to deciding the victor. Just ask the Lakers. Or what's left of them.   Controlling the action is easy, as you just use the thumbpad to move your player around the court. Switch players with the ~*~ button and when you get in the paint, press ~5~ to shoot. On defense ~5~ doubles as the block button, while ~0~ is used to attempt a steal. This is a smart, intuitive, and reactive system -- it works well for beginners and accomplished players alike.   Because things are moving quickly and the screen is admittedly small (making the ball even smaller), JAMDAT uses a colored ring to help you discern which one of your players is active. When you have the ball, the ring changes colors depending on your chances of scoring. If the ring is green, you're all money. Make the shot and enjoy your two. If the ring is red, you're too guarded and need to back off or pass the ball. A yellow ring signifies that you are indeed guarded, but a good shot will likely make it. Even in this case, you are often better off just passing as the computer is actually pretty adept at blocking shots.   Of course, the best way to get around this is to rely on threes. This is one of the game's weaknesses, as we nailed an awful lot of threes. And by many different players. We watch the NBA pretty regularly and have seen more clang off the rim than make it, and even though this is an arcade-style game, the hit ratio is just too high.   One last arcade touch: a power meter. In the lower right corner of the screen you'll spy a basketball shaped meter that fills with each successful shot. If you hit three in a row, your player is effectively ~on fire.~ Blazing players nail monster dunks or throw unopposed alley-oops. If you are on defense, you're blocking is just too tight for the competition. The power meter is actually pretty slick, even if it makes a game a little easier, as there really are times in league play where you'll see a player just go on an uncontested hot streak.   JAMDAT Sports NFL 2005 is a pretty decent looking game -- but it's not quite as nice as JAMDAT Sports NBA 2005. The player sprites are well proportioned and have some good animation, but they just look too same-y. Memory limitations may have something to do with this, but as far as we can tell, only skin hues change. However, the court looks good with hardwood textures and reflections of stadium-side signage.   JAMDAT Sports NBA 2005 opts for in-game noises rather than constant music. You'll hear intro tunes, but after that, you'll hear noises for mainly just shots and blocks.  The decision to go arcade was for the best, as I cannot imagine trying to manage ten little dudes running the floor. And besides, I still have good vibes from NBA Jam, which JAMDAT Sports NBA 2005 certainly evokes thanks to its 2-on-2 play and the power meter. However, for anybody looking for a sim-ish experience, JAMDAT Sports NBA 2005 is probably too easy for extended enjoyment.JAMDAT Sports NBA 2005, though, does its best to deliver a somewhat authentic NBA experience, even in the face of its arcade trappings. I like having full rosters and real team names. If you're lloking for a baller for your phone, JAMDAT Sports NBA 2005 is your best choice right now. What the future holds, as other game makers are finalizing their b-ball games, is uncertain.", "date": "Nov 13, 2004"}
