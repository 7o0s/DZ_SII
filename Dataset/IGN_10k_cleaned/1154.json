And while it may not be a huge disappointment, it's a letdown just the same. Destruction Derby, contrary to everybody's expectations, slid into this unfortunate category. And worse of all, it's not really something you can readily put your finger on.  The graphics are quite good. The trail of steam pouring out of your car's cracked, smashed radiator is especially impressive. The control is also good. You'll waste no time in learning to ram your car into others.  The two-player mode is great fun. Who wouldn't enjoy smashing into your friend at high speeds, gaining points each crash? It is, after all, a fanatasy shared by most motorists. The problem arises in the one-player race mode. It's just not exciting enough to hold your attention - the control is way, way too loose. Psygnosis promises more intense racing action in the sequel, but for the time being, stick to the pit.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
