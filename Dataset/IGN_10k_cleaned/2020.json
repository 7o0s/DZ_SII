The look and feel of the game has changed quite a bit in this next step of evolution in the series. No more cartoons here boys and girls, this is some nitty gritty dark spooky gaming. The look will definitely have you feeling alone in the dark sometimes, but then, the outdated Resident Evil horror survival style of gameplay might as well.  So good 'ol supernatural loving Ed Carnby from the first games is here to solve another mystery of the occult. This time, one of his best friends and long time associates Charles Fisk has been killed and he's headed out to a dark and foreboding place called... Shadow Island (insert echo here). With him on this little foray into evil is a luscious little filly named Aline Cedrac looking to find more information about a Native American tribe called the Abkani along with some other more personal goals. On the way out to Shadow Island (insert echo once again), they run into a bit of nasty weather and their plane goes down in a mess. Luckily for the two of them, Ed is one slick worker and throws parachutes on both himself and his new lady friend. He pushes her out and then follows suit. Unfortunately for the both of them, they land in separate areas of a really spooky island. At the end of the opening cinematic, you get the choice to play as either Carnby or Aline.   This is actually one of the strong points of the game. I chose to play through as Carnby first because his one noted characteristic was that he possessed a double barrel pistol. ~Double barrel pistol?~ said I, ~this is my kind of freak.~ After playing a little ways with him, a quick in-game cut-scene will be enacted where Carnby and Aline get in touch with each other via their handy dandy walkie-talkies. Throughout the game, you'll hear more from your partner in crime either through more cut-scenes or because you can press a button to talk to the other at any time. You'll get a chance to hear how things are going for the other character and learn about their experiences. Now when you play through as the other character, as I did with Aline, you'll step into the other half of the story and experience what you were just hearing about over the connection. It was a fun way to blend the experiences of two separate pieces of a story together into a pretty cohesive whole. You'll run through several of the same areas and see changes that the other has been making to the environment. You'll also actually come in contact with the other in a couple of situations where some exchanging of items and information takes place adding to the interconnectivity.  Both of the characters will find themselves immersed in a unholy little plot to let the World of Darkness out onto our nice and happy world of light. This island is the epicenter for the action. Upon the island are several different areas including a very creepy house with an evil and bloody history. It's the residence of the Morton family, a very insane group of people that were and are infatuated with the World of Darkness. Many experiments were done on people and so on and so forth. While the story is new, many of the conventions are the same, which is what really holds true with the game itself.  What we have here is a survival horror game that puts you in the middle of a scary situation, gives you some weapons and tells you to survive and find out what's really going on. To make it through the game you'll have to take advantage of various weapons from the three-barrel shotgun to a lightning gun to blow away some baddies as well as solving some puzzles. I was actually fairly impressed with some of the puzzles. While there certainly is some handholding going on through some of them, others are pretty fun to figure out. Although the convention of ~find the key to unlock the door~ held true in a lot of the game, it didn't really bother me as much as it used to as small puzzles were often hiding them instead of the regular box or enemy.  The game adopts that damn Resident Evil/adventure game/still camera with the set camera type of control system. I just don't understand what the fascination is with this control system is. You run around in a room, running into various objects that look so pretty you'll wish you could control the camera to see all of it. In the meantime, nasty little leg humping, face-eating monsters will be gnawing on you while you try to turn and shoot them. And in some of the game you may just find yourself out of ammunition. This means you'll need to be able to run away from the action which can be exceedingly frustrating as you run into objects and creatures due to the set camera. While I can't say that I ever actually died in the game, it was pretty frustrating to have monsters hit you while you were trying to navigate around this cardboard box or that tricky doorjamb....  While you can play the game with the keyboard, I found it easier to hook up a gamepad and play that way. Either way, you're going to suffer some of the frustrations that the camera angles and controls provide. If you've played these games before, then you'll know what I'm talking about... you run down a long hall towards the still camera with nothing in front of you. But when you reach the edge of the area so that you can't see any farther in front of your character, a creature attaches its teeth to you while you're left cursing the stupidity of it all.  One thing that I did enjoy in the game was the use of the light. You come equipped with a flashlight as either character and can point it in all directions to see where you're going if you can't find a light switch. Not only is it a great visual effect, but it also causes some of the light sensitive creatures to retreat in the game. By shining the light in different directions, you'll also get clues about items that you can pick up by the shine that comes off of them. This way they can blend useable objects into the background a bit more without you having to try to use everything in the game. I thought it worked very well.   While I'm not a fan of the control style for gameplay purposes, the environments wouldn't have been nearly as nice if everything had been rendered in full 3D in real time. Well, they could have been but you would have needed a Cray to complete the task. The looks of the game are indeed beautiful more often than not. Although at the same time, it suffers the same sort of lifeless stillness that games like Myst do because of the memory requirements of those high-res environments. Character animations were also done very well with some lifelike walks and runs. Unfortunately in the age of lip movement, there was no lip movement. I was a little surprised to see that there wasn't even an attempt to make it look like characters were actually talking with different facial textures or something. Which brings me to the little things such as the parchments of paper and diaries that you find during the game that are supposedly written by various people. They're all in the same dumb type that looks nothing like it was written in the 1800's. A little thing, but it would have helped to suspend the disbelief.   Unfortunately, one of the things that generally makes games suspenseful, the sound work, isn't always top notch. Oh, it certainly has its moments where I felt all skeeved out and once where I actually made a little brown deposit in my unmentionables... but I turned the music off. Off. I never turn the music off. I love game music nowadays for the atmosphere and just because there's a lot of it that's really good. This was not. I felt like I was stuck in one of those music boxes with the monkey asking for money... you know the ones I'm talking about. Sound effects... suitably creepy... music... horribly poopy.   So what we have in the end is a fairly good addition to the ranks of the annoying horror survival control system. While it wasn't Undying scary, it definitely had some moments that made me jump and scream like Tal when he got his... well, nevermind. All in all, if you're a fan of this type of game, there's a good chance you'll like it. Hell, I liked it a bit and I'm not a fan of this type of game. But don't go in expecting the same old Alone in the Dark because you won't find it waiting for you.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
