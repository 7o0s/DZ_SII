Instead of crafting a 10-20 hour experience, the developers are expected to make something that you'll be coming back to for months and months, with a core crowd that may sustain the title for years. World of Warcraft, for example, started with about 1500 quests. That's one thousand five hundred quests. Granted, the overwhelming majority of those boil down to ~kill this dude~ or ~get this stuff,~ but it's still a heck of an achievement, and the number of quests quickly ballooned. I think what gives WoW its strength is a combination of the novelty of exploring the Warcraft universe on foot, the delightful and varied art style, and its sense of humor. That and hundreds of servers across the world to satisfy what is probably approaching five million subscribers at this point.     NCsoft has taken the clever approach of largely avoiding fantasy MMOs (in the United States, at least) and thereby deflecting the wrath of the 800-pound behemoth that WoW has become. City of Heroes is a jewel in the company's crown, and it was only a matter of time before they expanded on the premise and offered players the chance to be evil. CoV also gives you the opportunity to dress evil, with tons of additional character creation options on top of the current wardrobe. Villains can look undeniably villainous, with the beast and zombie templates being the most popular. I went with red and black, with lots of buckles, straps, chains, and leather. Once I got to level 20, I had a similarly deep set of options for cape creation. You'd have to go out of your way to design something that didn't fit the rest of your outfit. And all the while you can go to the Tailor and tweak things to your liking, for a fee. Overall, I was never short on money, so it was easy to try something else when the notion struck me.   For those of you just joining the hoopla, City of Villains is the companion to City of Heroes, taking place in the Rogue Isles. Although they're islands, there's plenty of room for the urban and industrial environments that CoH players are familiar with, and you can play both games for a total of $15 a month. CoV also gives your supergroup the ability to build a base, where you can resurrect if you die, turn salvage into base items, and set up traps to defend a relic of power. The base building interface is quite clean and intuitive, and like costume creation, the possibilities are virtually endless. You'll have several different templates to choose from, and you can mix and match as you like. Depending on your budget, you can create an enormous palace, but you will have to pay rent every couple weeks. If you don't, the power shuts down, so you can do salvage or hospital functions. Fortunately, there's no back rent piling up, so you'll never have to pay more than the last rent bill, no matter how long it's been. Money to build stuff is gained through Prestige, which you acquire like experience points when you're in Super Group Mode. You gain a little less experience in this mode, but it's nothing too bad. You'll also have access to the team colors, so you can adjust your outfit at any time if you like. My SG's colors are purple and beige, though, so that's kind of hideous.     At any rate, let's get down to what it's like to play CoV. If you've played City of Heroes, there aren't any fundamental differences, for better or worse. You have the Mastermind character class -- basically a necromancer, summoning minions to do the bulk of the fighting. As a Mastermind, you'll choose your development tree at the beginning; do you want to have mercenaries, ninjas, zombies, or robots? Each minion type has its advantages and disadvantages, and as you level up, you'll eventually be able to summon more of them at a time, and give them buffs (ability boosts, which are in this case permanent, until the minion dies). I chose zombies. At level 20, I can summon three grunts and one Knight. The grunts are two levels below me and the knight is one. There's a single buff spell that will have different effects depending on who you cast it on. The grunts get a ranged attack that does damage over time, and the knight gets an additional ranged attack and an enhanced melee attack. Eventually, I'll be able to summon a lich, but I can never have more than one at a time, nor can I have more than two knights or three grunt zombies. This keeps things more balanced during PvP.    I have to say that have minions to direct during your average PvE encounter keeps things pretty interesting. I started things out with a melee character, but that got boring fast. Unlike WoW, you can only choose one new skill every two levels, so you'll tend to use the same attack method for an extended period of time. In fact, as a Technology Mastermind, I still have only one nuke and one DoT at level 20. There's also a life transfer spell, but it eats a lot of Endurance (the equivalent of mana) and only pulls a small amount. I get about 30 points of health back at my level, which isn't very useful when I'm regularly getting hit for 75 points of damage. Granted, I'm rarely in the line of fire as Mastermind, but it hurts when I am. I can also get Enhancements that would boost the health amount, but the most I could manage at this point is about a 25% increase for that spell. Every odd-numbered level increase allows the player to add two more Enhancement slots, and you can slot multiple enhancements of the same type, if you have enough slots available.     On my Fly skill (which I highly recommend you get as soon as possible, at level 14), I have three slots, two of which are filled with class-specific boosts to speed and one to Endurance efficiency. Class-specific Enhancements are significantly more expensive, and their vendors much rarer. However, vendors are easily spotted on the overhead map, and their increased prices are justifiable, because you get some pretty big boosts. It's possible to raise your flight speed by 50% or more, depending on how many slots you've granted that ability, and this allows you to cover a lot of ground very fast. Your Fly skill will naturally increase in speed as you level up, but it's great to get that extra edge in PvP, when you need to get away or chase down another player. If you choose not to fly, usually for role-playing purpose, there are other branches of mobility, like super-fast running and an uber jump that vaults you high and far. I prefer flight for the ability to hover over a target. And it's also cool to go launching into the sky.   Whatever the case, you will typically have a lot of ground to cover, and there will often be some intimidating architectural obstacles in the way. Sometimes it's a city borough on an artificial mesa. Other times it's an open mine, or a mountain. I can't tell you how many times I had to traverse an entire zone to get to a mission or a mission giver, and running on the ground is a significant time sink, in the long run. It adds up. Once you can fly or run really fast, though, the dead time drops almost to nothing, which is awesome. Unfortunately, cutting out the fat of the game puts all the spotlights on the meat, and the core of the game doesn't completely stand up this level of scrutiny.     Like City of Heroes, the overwhelming majority of your experience will take place in ~instanced~ areas (mini-zones that are spawned as necessary to support individual teams or groups without external players interfering). There are more templates to choose from in City of Villains, but like CoH, you will be slogging through a lot of the same-looking sewers, office buildings, warehouses and caves before things start to get interesting. The instances are architected in a Lego style, with pre-fabricated rooms and corridors set down with a certain degree of randomized connection. You'll quickly recognize the same room template and the same corridor junctions, even though they're getting mixed and matched differently every time. And at level 20, I'm still fighting my through some the exact same types of areas that I did when I started.    Thankfully, though, things do get more interesting around level 15, although that may take a couple weeks for the more casual player. At this level, though, you'll start getting missions that are strung together to create some fairly interesting stories, with plot twists and some neat rewards at the end. You'll encounter high-profile characters in the Rogue Isles story line, and it's good to mix things up a little, because the missions are still pretty straightforward: kill these people, destroy or search for this item, and sometimes kill a specific ~boss~ mob and the mobs in his vicinity. The instances are also, for the most part, relatively small, usually taking about ten minutes to run through, with is either good or bad depending on your tastes. I should also mention that you'll be able to get into Strike Teams, akin to WoW's raid groups, and this allows you to do longer missions and invade enemy player bases, but the wealth of content in WoW at all levels is much deeper, while the Strike Team encounters are for those who have ventured through a goodly-sized heap of the game's usual fare.     More casual players will probably love the ability to do a variety of things in an hour or so, while the more dedicated players will probably be annoyed at the lack of mission depth that leads to a wash-and-rinse cycle of getting the mission, going to the mission, doing the mission, and getting another mission. There are a few large encounters here and there, but the norm is easily digestible, for better or worse. And CoH players will recognize the same mission types that have been only cosmetically reversed. Instead of rescuing someone, you're kidnapping them, but the functionality is identical. Instead of retrieving something, you might be destroying it. Much noise was made of ~villainous~ missions, but the only one I've seen that stands out is the bank heist. This is the smallest of the mission types, though, and it quickly becomes as rote as the other encounters.   Although you will occasionally encounter characters tied to the CoV story arc, you'll mostly be fighting anonymous foot soldiers and the occasional named individual. And you'll mostly be fighting evil factions, instead of heroes. I found this pretty disappointing. There are the Longbow and Talon groups, but they merely function as part of the modular mission system, rather than standing out as truly distinct groups with different aims and combat tactics. I was hoping that, as I villain, I could prey on innocent civilians, vandalize and destroy things, carve territory, beat up random heroes unwise enough to wander into the Isles, and generally make things go boom. Instead, the world is disappointingly static and hemmed in by City of Heroes game design. It's not a different game so much as an alternate take. As this was originally intended to be an expansion pack, maybe the lack of fundamental differentiation should be expected. But that explanation doesn't make the game more fun to play.    In the long run, City of Villains will appeal to those who still play CoH, but it won't pull you in if you didn't like the first game. The novelty of evil eventually wears off, and what remains is the same gameplay we had before. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but CoH didn't have excellent gameplay. Very good, but not excellent. And CoV, being not much different from CoH, suffers from its flaws as it benefits from the advantages. What keeps CoV from being truly great is what kept CoH from that plateau; the repetitive environments and quick missions will make things feel dull after a while, as will the relatively slow accumulation of combat skills. CoV looks great, with several new features added to give it some extra polish, but there are no new spell effects (or spell sound effects, for that matter). It also suffers from the occasional wonkiness we've come to expect at an MMO launch, but the problems I experienced were pretty rare. It crashed to the desktop a few times, but it never locked my system up. Some of the missions have scripting bugs and geometry holes, but the live team seems to be doing a good job of tracking things down and patching things up. Every few days there was a small patch that tweaked something or other, but CoV is relatively glitch-free, especially at this stage in its lifespan.It's just too bad that things get old kinda fast, and the more interesting mission sequences take a while to get to. I would still recommend CoV to the casual gamer who wants to dip their toes into an MMO, but I think those who are looking for the next big thing to dedicate their passion to would be better served by sticking to what they already have.", "date": "Nov 18, 2005"}
