Looney Tunes: Back in Action isn't setting ticket sales ablaze or receiving incredible critical praise, but it's big and important enough, especially with the revival of the Looney Tunes brand back into the mainstream, to justify a whole series of marketing tie-ins. Along with the action figures and rereleases of classic cartoons, Electronic Arts has produced a line of videogames based upon the film of the same name. The console version is its own beast, we're here to talk about the Game Boy Advance version...and once again, the handheld rendition doesn't receive nearly the attention it deserves. It's a hack of a game that has some promise but ends up a barely average and enjoyable rendition. And that's all, folks. Features Two playable characters Four levels Two mini-challenges Cartridge save (four slots) Looney Tunes: Back in Action is loosely based upon the plot of the holiday film, where players set out in different locations as Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck to locate the mythical Blue Monkey Diamond, a diamond with special powers that the head of the Acme corporation is looking to harness for its own diabolical purposes.  Warthog, the same developers that created the GameCube and PS2 Looney Tunes: Back in Action, put a handheld team onto this isometric collect-a-thon that's reminiscent of what Digital Eclipse has done with the Spyro the Dragon on the handheld. But in this case, it's hastily put together with poor focus on level design. Players control either Bugs or Daffy, each character having his own special unique abilities: Bugs can hover jump across distances and burrow between rabbitholes; Daffy can swim across some (but not all) water locations, as well as jump just a little bit further than Bugs. There are also special ~toony~ items to use against enemies, like a dropped anvil or piano that can only be used by specific characters...this little implementation just seems forced into the design to ensure that players are switching between the two more than they would otherwise.  The game looks and sounds nice...initially. The game puts to use the familiar isometric perspective, that camera angle that's tipped somewhat so that the Game Boy Advance can display a more 3D viewpoint in 2D without the need for those things called ~polygons.~ The characters, including the game leads Bugs and Daffy as well as the cameos (Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam, and even the recently-shunned-because-of-Politically-Correctness Speedy Gonzales) have been CG rendered into smoothly animated sprites. But then, the game starts moving. And then it happens: the dreaded slowdown. Get more than a couple characters on-screen and play a digitized sample, and the game begins to chug. Noticably. It'll snap back to its fast pace, but it'll continue to chug throughout the adventure. The game also turns characters transparent when standing in front of specific objects, when such an effect should be limited to when the sprite wanders behind something. It seems like a minor deal, but it does play with the head.  But the slowdown and graphical glitches are the least of the game's worries. No, the biggest issue is that it's unbelievably boring. Its heart is in the right place, as the developers try to put a bit of variety into the game levels by offering racing challenges, or a mini-game inspired by Bomberman to reward extra lives. But without these little elements, it just boils down to A) Collect money scattered around the area and B) Collect monkeys scattered around the area. The combination of the game's isometric perspective and slippery collision detection also makes it tough to shove items around the area ...especially during the Bomb-shoving mini-challenges.  Even worse, the game does support cartridge save, but players are forced to complete the entire first level before they can even save their position. And that could take literally an hour or more.  The level structure is so open and bland that it would have worked in favor of the game design to actually allow for save points scattered within a level. Instead, players will have to complete the entire first level in one sitting. And that's quite an enduring feat if you're on the road. Looney Tunes: Back in Action is yet another rushed-to-market Game Boy Advance game that starts out promising but just ends up flopping flat on its beak. Even fans of the Looney Tunes characters (like myself) will find it hard to enjoy Bugs and Daffy's first official romp across the Game Boy Advance screen.", "date": "Dec 4, 2003"}
