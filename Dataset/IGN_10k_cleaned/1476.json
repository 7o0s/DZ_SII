{"name": "Aladdin", "name_review": "Disney's Aladdin", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/15/disneys-aladdin-3", "text": "Before there was Earthworm Jim, David Perry worked at Virgin Interactive as the development lead on Disney Interactive's Aladdin game for the Genesis.  The game was overall an outstanding product, but what really brought attention to it was Aladdin's attention to graphics -- the designers felt the only way to accurately portray a Disney animated film in videogames is to represent the animation accordingly. It really was the first of its kind in the 16-bit era, and we had to boot up the original Genesis just to remember what it was like. And geez, the game still holds up even today -- sweet, silky-smooth animation and fluid gameplay mechanics still make the Genesis game one of the best for the system.   Even though Virgin's US office is no longer around, Disney Interactive holds the rights to the game and has handed it over to Ubi Soft, who then went to Crawfish Interactive (responsible for GBC Driver, Street Fighter Alpha, Rainbow Six) to bring the original Genesis game to life on the handheld. Though the solid gameplay has remained relatively intact, what made Disney's Aladdin such a special, spectacular game is not portrayed in the portable rendition. Feature Based on the blockbuster Disney film  Designed from the award-winning Sega Genesis version of Aladdin  Nine locations from the movie Only for Game Boy Color Disney's Aladdin follows the plot of the 1993 animated film (you know, the one that featured Mork as a blue genie), or, at least, follows as much as it possibly can in run-and-jump gameplay form. As Aladdin, you've got yourself a sword and a pocketful of apples to hock at the thieves and guards that inhabit the streets and deserts of Agrabah. Using Aladdin's acrobatics, you'll have to get to the end of each level unscathed (relatively) by slicing enemies and avoiding obstacles like pots and fire pits. Some of the levels have classic-but-clever old-school designs like disappearing/reappearing platforms and rope networks to leap and hang from. As a platform game, Aladdin's got plenty of variety and challenge to keep you going to the end.  What really hurts the game, though, is its sloppy scrolling game engine. Even without the Genesis game to compare it to, the Game Boy Color version has plenty of slowdown and flicker even when there's not much happening on-screen. And compared to the Genesis version, the portable version lacks most of the charm that made the original so much fun to watch. A lot of the jokes going on in the background (like the Mickey ears hanging off a clothesline or a Genie mensroom) and character animations are lost since the developer went with a small, one-megabyte cartridge -- without the memory in the cartridge, there wasn't room to fit all the frames of animation or background graphics. And the game is missing the Abu the Monkey bonus game -- another omission that hurts this translation. Even the graphics themselves lack the original Genesis feel -- they're more pastel and washed out on the Game Boy Color screen. I'm definitely aware of the GBC's limitations, but platform games like Donald Duck and Rayman show that the hardware's capable of more than what Crawfish offered here.  But the original Genesis game was extremely difficult, and this is where Crawfish improved it -- not only offering three difficulty settings, but also a password system so you don't have to play through all the levels just to get up to where you bit the big one. The limited continues and lack of game save really hurt the Genesis version's playability, so it's great to see the password option added to the design.  Disney's Aladdin could have been that game that showed skeptics that the Game Boy Color hardware has a lot of 2D capabilities -- I'm sure the game could have been done a lot cleaner and smoother with added resources and tighter programming. But instead, an amazing-looking Genesis game gets reduced down to a mediocre looking and above-average playing portable title on the GBC -- granted, the Genesis is a 16-bit system and the GBC an updated NES, but I've seen better, smoother, and faster on the hardware. It plays well enough, but the flicker and slowdown is a distraction.", "date": "Nov 15, 2000"}
