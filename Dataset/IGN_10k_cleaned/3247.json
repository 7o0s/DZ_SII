The primary gaming machine of my parents and grandparents (who are the ones who got me into this crazy hobby in the first place), the Atari 2600 in particular was the most dominating machine of that era. In no small part the champion of gaming libraries, the 2600's success was due in no small part, to the excellent third-party support provided by the American programming company known as Activision. Using an effective combination of original and cloned titles in great abundance, the young programming club shot to the number one slot in terms of 2600 cartridge sales, and to this day are still remembered for their most historic contribution to the videogame field: the original Pitfall!   Up until now there have been plenty of previous compilation sets and collections highlighting some of Activision's biggest and most popular titles. Available on both the PC and PlayStation, the various sets have brought 80s veterans back to the early days of console gaming with great success and appropriate acclaim. But none of them we think (Activision's or otherwise) have ever been this big or this well put together. Bursting out at the seams with nearly every Activision and Imagic Atari 2600 title ever released, Activision Anthology is the end-all/ be-all of retro gaming collections. And like the wildfire gaming craze of the ~Me~ decade before it, has sparked quite the retro gaming bug for the twenty-aged editors of the IGN office.   Features  Activision Anthology is the biggest compilation set we've ever seen. Tipping the scales at 48 perfectly emulated games, players new and old should find it an easy task to locate something to fit their tastes. Just to let you know just how big it really is, we found it a rather fitting task to list each and every one of them for you in the next paragraph. That said, here are the 48 available titles in a couple of very long-winded breaths, and divided by the racks they appear in:    Rack number one boasts Boxing, Bridge, Checkers, Dragster, Fishing Derby, Skiing, Freeway, and Ice Hockey, while the second slot has Kaboom, Demon Attack, Laser Blast, Tennis, Atlantis, Barnstorming, Chopper Command, and Stampede. Number three consists of Grand Prix, Megamania, Pitfall, River Raid, Sky Jinx, Spider Fighter, and Star Master, while we continue to count away in rack numero quarto with Beamrider, Moonsweeper, Crackpots, Activision Decathlon, Dolphin, Enduro, Frostbite, Keystone Kapers, and Oink! Moving towards the more obscure games out there, the fifth rack has titles like Plaque Attack, Pressure Cooker, Private Eye, Seaquest, Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space, Cosmic Commuter, H.E.R.O., Pitfall II: Lost Caverns, and Robot Tank. Finally, we come to the sixth and final rack that consists of Title Match Pro Wrestling, Commando, Baseball, Tomcat: The F14 Flight Simulator, River Raid II, and the never before released Kabobber and Thwocker.   Older gamers and fans of previous compilation sets on other platforms may notice that Kabobber and Thwocker were never released for the Atari 2600 in the first place. Planned but eventually scrapped, they never made it out of the warehouses until now. Other games like Baseball, Bridge, and Beamrider are available for the first time since they were originally released, and for those of us who were kids at the time and didn't have enough money to get the games we wanted, this is a great way to come full circle.   Luckily, the programmers have included some extra goodies for good measure. Giving every game in the collection zero to five unlockable bonuses each, the Easter Eggs can be unleashed by defeating certain high scores or living up to certain tasks. These extra bonuses are almost as much fun as the games themselves, and range anywhere from recreations of the old Activision send-away patches and commercials to all-new gameplay modes that affect how your screen reacts as you play it. V-Hold and Disco Mode in particular stand out as entertaining little diversions and can enhance your experience with the classics rather effectively.   The only regrets we have in the whole set are the lack of planned Internet support. Originally planned to include the ability to log onto Activision's retro gaming website to download additional games to your collection (such as the other Imagic titles like Riddle of Sphinx or Cosmic Ark), the feature was ultimately scrapped because of time and budget constraints. So when you notice that your rack has a few empty slots, you know why -- downloaded games were supposed to go there. Another thing we found bothersome was that a High Score table wasn't included. The game is obviously keeping track of how well you do (how else would it know when to give you unlockables?), why not include the ability to record those performances for posterity?    Gameplay  They may seem simple to us now but at the height of their popularity, the titles in this collection were excellent time wasters. Games like Pitfall, River Raid, and Keystone Kapers in particular were revered by the mainstream media and limited gaming press as some of the most entertaining software of all time (granted the medium was a bit on the young side but it's still quite the accomplishment).   Made up primarily of basic pattern memorization and button-mashing reflexes, the depth of these games never went beyond the simple visuals they were portrayed with. And other than a few basic guidelines (shoot others while avoiding getting shot), anyone could sit down, plug one of the cartridges in, and spend the next few hours of their life engrossed in this little digital world. Who cares if there weren't experience points, health retainers, or armor power-ups? This was fun stuff damn it! Not to mention an excellent source for developing the hand-eye coordination our teachers and parents were so concerned about.   Don't be fooled though, there's some true complexity to some of the games in this collection. Space Shuttle for instance is a full-blown flight simulator, which is made even more difficult by the presence of only a single button. Tomcat: F14 is just as heavy duty, with other games like Pressure Cooker and Private Eye moving beyond the conventional idea of moving from point A to point B while shooting something, and forces you to think and react in a more deliberate manner.   But come on, whom are we kidding here? These games are 20 years old. The majority of them rarely move beyond the type of experience you'd find in a last-generation XE title. Part of what makes this set so fantastic in addition to the games themselves however, is how players are encouraged to play through everything. Unlike other sets than just lay the games out on the table and ask for your twenty bucks, the programmers threw in a bunch of extras to make it worth your while to check everything out. It's a brilliant move and one that developers for other retro collections may want to remember for the future.    Unfortunately, the layout of the PS2 controller doesn't always compliment the requirements of certain games. In Decathlon for instance, your maximum speed can only be accomplished by going crazy with the analog controller, but because of the position of the reset button (located at L1), it's not very comfortable to grip the Dual Shock in a proper manner to reach the speeds you're need without restarting a few times. While this is an isolated case, it still could have been fixed. At least the black & white button was delegated to triangle, and doesn't get in the way much.   Regardless of any incentives, lack of complexities, or occasional control issues however, know this -- almost every game in this set is worth your time. Patches, commercials, or otherwise, this is not only a lesson in gaming history, it's pure unadulterated fun. What's more important than that in a videogame?   Graphics  Revolutionary for the time, the visuals in Activision Anthology fall extremely short of today's standards. Clocking in at 20 years old, the simple 8-bit graphics pale in comparison to the remedial eye candy of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Built using individual paintbrush sprites, the childish affair offers limited animation and few variety in colors (turn to the most visually intensive games on the disc, like Pitfall II and Robot Tank for proof.   To be honest though, some of these titles look amazing for the type of hardware limitations the programmers were given at the time. The aforementioned Robot Tank for instance really stands out. Not only does it give the appearance of three-dimensional movement, it also sports cool aesthetic day-to-night transitions, weather goodies, and a damaged-screen short circuit effect when your tank is hit.   The bedroom front-end however is put together quite effectively, with a virtual Atari 2600 system sitting right in front of an old RF television. Combine that with the picture-perfect scans of each game's original manual and box art, dead-on recreations of the Activision send-away patches, and decent (if not seriously compressed) FMV of the old commercials, and you have yourself an ugly, but acceptable history lesson.    Sound  Since the games on this collection were made near the beginning of 1980, the sound effect selection is nothing more than a few blips and bleeps. In fact, the majority of the titles shares the same noise pool, and unless you're a true fan, probably couldn't tell the difference between these games on audio alone. Not having a soundtrack on a per-game basis contributes a lot to that.   The soundtrack that is present however, is great. A quick assemblage of about a dozen distinctly 80s tunes, the virtual radio that plays in the background captures the blossoming decade perfectly. We're Not Gonna Take It from Twisted Sister, Its My Life from Talk Talk, Tainted Love via Soft Cell, and Take On Me from A-Ha, are but a few of the twelve kick-butt songs that can be switched on or off via the boom box in your virtual room's corner; Very nice indeed.We'd be lying if we said that that Activision Anthology hasn't been the main source of our videogaming pleasure over the last couple of weeks. A true walk down memory lane, and the most cleverly built multi-game collection we've ever seen, its certainly worth whatever money your local retailer is asking for it (which as of press time was clocking in somewhere around the thirty dollar mark). Occasional control issues aside (damn you evil reset button!), there's a guaranteed party just about every instance you fire this disc up.So what's the hold up? Slap on that ~Members Only~ jacket, fire up the Men Without Hats Safety Dance, and settle down to your favorite game in Disco Mode. We promise you that you won't regret it. Without hesitation, Activision Anthology is deserving of our gnarliest and most bodacious of recommendations. Righteous!", "date": "Nov 21, 2002"}
