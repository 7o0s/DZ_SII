While the scale and complexity of such attempts at reality are becoming more and more monolithic, the ideas have been around for years. From Super Mario World to the Final Fantasy series, the notion that your television set can take you to a world unlike any other truly captures the imagination. With the phenomenon that is Shenmue getting closer and closer to a stateside release, fans that are eager to immerse themselves into a living environment are getting antsy. What better opportunity for Eidos then, is it to release their own adventure simulator Omikron?A direct port of last year's PC escapade of the same name, Omikron is best described as Messiah and Shenmue's illegitimate child. An eclectic mix of genres, Omikron has more sub-games in its guts than 3DO has Army Men. Adventure elements and fighting snippets galore, every category from racing to the good old fashioned girlfriend sim has been included. A title that lets you do the coconut jiggle with your woman in the first 15 minutes can't be too bad right...? Nope, not entirely. But it does have its problems.Now before I go off into a rant that would irritate Dennis Miller's lawyers, and point out every single glaring flaw Eidos and Quantic Dream left floating around Omikron's intestines, let me make one thing clear; It's not THAT bad a game. Easily an above average effort on the PC, and a more than unique experience on Dreamcast, there are few games that take as big a chance as this one. Throwing everything out on the table and trying to emulate most of the industry's most popular genres is not an easy feat. The team deserves kudos for the attempt at least.Also worth a mention is the fine musical score courtesy of your friend and mine, David Bowie. Teamed with long time associate Reeves Gabrels, the duo has really done a number with the soundtrack, and likens itself to something out of a modern-day cyber punk flick. The opening theme (Omikron - New Angels of Promise) especially reaches out and demands your audio attention. Lets hope that more developers out there learn a thing or two from Eido's example. Start snatching up some of the better musical celebrities of their own to give us our tunes!Graphically, the game's textures seem to look a bit crisper here than it did on it's PC counterpart. No mean feat the considering power and resolution differences between the two platforms. Of course, the programmers didn't have to compensate for varying system configurations, so texture optimization was probably a lot easier to handle. The frame rate however has seemingly taken a nose dive and splashed into an abyss of random load times and odd glitches.In the computer version, there were access times between scenery changes just as there is here. Comparatively however, the load time differences are drastic. Slight pauses in the action as the information was streamlined from the disc was commonplace on PC, and almost unnoticeable. The Dreamcast's reaction is an entirely different proposition. Frequent hang ups and stillness can see you come to an absolute standstill for a few seconds and frustrate over time. Why not just have a longer load screen in the beginning to add that particular zone into memory to be explored in real time later?Another oversight in the game design would have to be in how experience is handled. Borrowing the famous system used by many RPGs, your character can go up skill levels based on practice and battle frequency. The only problem? There is no meter, chart, or number to keep track of your progress! Jumping into battles and not knowing whether it'll actually mean something in the long run bothered me quite a bit, and almost gave the illusion that acquiring skill levels was random. Not earned. Ho hum.And while the directional scheme is actually very responsive and fun to use when in ~Fighting mode~, some of the other areas in the realm of control can pose serious problems. Running in straight lines while walking on the street, or aiming your character the correct direction when speaking or picking up items can be tricky. First-person mode is a big let down, and why isn't there an analog option? If this is a 3D world, where is our 3D controls?One of the most innovative features the game boasts is the ~Virtual Reincarnation~ system. Which, like Messiah lets you zap around from body to body exploiting the special powers and abilities of each. It really is cool at first, and infinitely more plot-oriented than the aforementioned Messiah. Sadly, the novelty wears off as you near the end of the game, and by the time it's all said and done you wish that you could just hurry up and pick the guy (or girl) that can see you through with the least amount of resistance.There are a few other little nit-picks I have as well. Like obvious oversights that were missed in the translation process (example: In the intro to the game, the first character you encounter verbally says he is contacting you through your computer, while the sub-titled text reads ~Dreamcast~. I half expected to see ~Spoony Bard~ laced somewhere in the text as well, but fortunately I was spared). Freeze frames seemed to appear a little too often for me as well. As many times the inventory list that was on your screen a second ago, seemed to have been burned on to the screen for the next few minutes... after you've already left the inventory screen and returned to the adventure POV. Weird.Believe it or not, despite all these quarrelsome issues Omikron still manages to deliver some solid entertainment. Not a title you'll play over and over again by any means, the open-ended and intriguing story-line with it's cleverly veiled mystery is worth checking out at least once. And the fighting game portions of the game are a blast. If only the means to get there weren't so flawed.Cool only because of it's atmosphere, mystery, and music, Omikron: The Nomad Soul is a mixed bag of both pleasant surprise and honest disappointment. With an already announced sequel on the way, perhaps the problems with this installment can be addressed and fixed. But that's another story for another time. A bare bones port at it's most naked, you may want to rent before you buy.-- Jeremy Dunham, ContributorEven though this game was an obviously rushed PC port, it has some good things going for it. The cyberpunk setting of the game is extremely cool, and since the game is a little similar to Shenmue in style, it's one that adventure fans (like me) will dig. If they spent a little more time and polished up the port more (by reducing the jittering streaming, for example) it would have been a must-have adventure for DC owners. As it stands at release, however, only hardcore adventure gamers should apply.", "date": "Jul 6, 2000"}
