There are a lot of films and whatnot that claim to be fun for the whole family, but nine times out of ten, the result is more like fun for the brain-damaged three-year-old and gut-wrenching pain for anyone with an ounce of intelligence or maturity.  There have been games that managed to beat the odds - Mario is the most familiar of them, naturally, but there are others that manage to blend a modicum of youthful attitude with gameplay that's both deep and easy to grasp, resulting in something that anyone with an open mind can get into.  On the PlayStation, I'd say the best example is Spyro the Dragon.  Crash Bandicoot may draw the most press, while Spyro has always remained on Universal's second string, but as both a game and a character I've had the most fun with the purple dragon, rather than the bright orange rodent-thing.  He's cuter, he's friendlier, and his world is all 3D, Insomniac having made their way much more cleverly around the limitations the PlayStation imposes on the creation of a free-roaming environment.  The original Spyro was a bit of a sleeper in that regard, one of the earlier PlayStation games to do a fully 3D world more or less right.  Spyro 2, on the other hand, was eagerly awaited, and it delivered in full, an expanded sequel with much more to see and do.  Now we come to Spyro: Year of the Dragon, which looks like it will be Insomniac's last outing behind the property, as well as the last Spyro game on the PlayStation.  The future of the character is pretty hazy right now, but as far as the present goes, Year of the Dragon possesses all of Spyro's universal appeal and then some.  It's more than just Spyro, packing in a handful of new playable characters, all with their own unique worlds and gameplay mechanics, to go along with the sharply-executed dragonish action we know and love.  Gameplay  Your quest, in Year of the Dragon, is essentially the same as it has been in Spyros previous.  In this case, you're after baby dragon eggs, as opposed to imprisoned elder dragons and the like, but the essential concept is the same.  You explore 3D worlds (over 30 altogether), defeat enemies, complete puzzles, and collect eggs and gems as your reward for progressing, all the while making use of Spyro's familiar abilities.  He doesn't have much in the way of brand-new movies, but he controls as well as ever, once you learn how to keep the automatic camera under control.  The action is just as liberally seasoned with well-designed mini-games and other diversionary episodes, far more than there were before, including skateboarding, sub-hunting, boxing, and more.  I'm liable to be breaking from traditional opinion when I say I liked the submarine section better than the skating game, but the mini-games are still basically icing on the cake.  The big difference now is the addition of four new playable characters, or five if you count the special vertical-shooter levels starring Sparx the mosquito.   Spyro's quest to recapture the dragon eggs is aided by Bentley the yeti, Sheila the kangaroo, rocket-launching Sergeant Byrd (a flying penguin), and blaster-wielding space monkey Agent 9.  Yes, a space monkey.  I'm sorry if I've dwelt on the space monkey a bit much in earlier discussions of the game, but come on - how many times have you seen a space monkey in a game?  IGNDC's Brandon Justice is saying ~not enough~ from the other side of the cubicle wall, so to each their own, I suppose.  The biggest question surrounding Year of the Dragon's shift to a multi-character focus is whether it can make that many different gameplay models work, while still making them a unique alternative to the way Spyro himself plays.  The answer?  Very well, I'd say.  Insomniac has obviously put in a fair amount of time reworking the level design, puzzles, and enemy behavior to accomodate the radically changed gameplay of characters like Sergeant Byrd, who has big open levels to suit his flight and long-distance attacks, or Sheila, who has much more vertical levels to make use of her double-jumping ability.  The new characters have their own new game elements to work with their particular capabilities, and they also interact differently with existing objects and situations - they fit into the existing model, as well as changing it to suit themselves in some cases.  Graphics  Spyro has always, in its low-key way, been one of the best-looking series on the PlayStation.  Its cartoony style skips intensive texture detail in favor of lots of smooth Gouraud shading, sharp character models, large environments, and plenty of speed.  As per usual, you will not encounter any framerate problems in Year of the Dragon, whether you're flying through the air or blazing along a racetrack as fast as the little dragon's legs can carry him (which is pretty fast, especially in the chase levels held over from Spyro 2).  Special effects for lighting, fire, water, smoke, explosions, and so on are all professionally implemented, resulting in a clean, cohesive visual package.  Most of the game's character models are fairly simple, but they move with a fluidity that adds a lot to the overall impression of a sort of playable cartoon.  Almost everyone has exaggerated motions: Bentley jumps up and leans far forward when he slams his club down, Sheila kicks out with both feet like a Looney Tunes refugee, and Spyro's feet almost become a Road Runner-esque blur when he really gets going.  There are some nice understated animations as well, though, like the hopping gait of the mountain goats or Spyro's quizzical facial expressions.  Personality  Most games don't get much commentary in this area, but Spyro deserves its own section to praise its ever-engaging quality of charm.  The graphics, sound, and design of the game come together to create something that you can really grow fond of if you aren't too much of a cynical sort (which I am not, at least most of the time).  The character design shows Insomniac's knack for the iconic types made popular in American animation.  They're all drawn in very broad strokes, but the concepts work - even if they stretch the bounds of credibility just a little bit (I can only just accept the space monkey), they don't go anywhere near the British excess of something like Fur Fighters.  Sound  And then there is the voice acting, which is as goofy as ever in Year of the Dragon.  Just about every creature you encounter speaks with a different ridiculous accent, and while they're all of them over the top, it's not in an irritating or offensive way.  If this country can hardly do serious voice acting worth a damn (although congratulations go out to exceptions like Metal Gear and Soul Reaver), at least we have comedy down to a science.  The voices and effects range from mildly amusing to extremely funny - you'll crack a smile more than a few times throughout the game.Putting aside my personal enthusiasm for the game, this essentially comes down to the question of whether or not you want more Spyro.  The odds are you do, given how good it's always been, but this is still an evolution, not a radical change in the nature of the series.  Year of the Dragon features more than just Spyro, and it's an eminiently successful effort on Insomniac's part to expand and develop the scope of their game, but the balance of the action is still familiar, as is the visual style.  Spyro is still at the helm in the lion's (dragon's?) share of gameplay sequences - about two-thirds of the proper exploration levels belong to him, with the others divided up between the four sub-characters.  The shift in character focus is enough to provide more than a little diversion for fans of the series, but it won't necessarily change anybody's mind one way or the other about Spyro.Interpret that according to your own preference, then.  If you liked the past Spyros, this one will almost certainly be your favorite of the lot.  It has all their speed and graphical polish, the same remarkably well-done control, lots more variety in its gameplay, and most of all, the dangerously cute Spyro personality.  I wonder, actually, about the inclusion of the new characters in the game, whether Insomniac was perhaps getting a little bored working with just their title character.  One way or the other, they'll be off to something new and next-generation once they get back from their post-Spyro vacation.  But Year of the Dragon, even if Spyro has to share a little bit of the spotlight, is as fine a note as any for them to go out on, and proves that the PlayStation, even if it's losing all its thunder to PS2, can still play host to a universally excellent game.", "date": "Oct 13, 2000"}
