{"name": "Charge'n Blast", "name_review": "Charge N' Blast (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/16/charge-n-blast-import", "text": "As far as I'm concerned, there are three types of arcade games. You've got open-ended action, such as Crazy Taxi and House of the Dead 2; these titles feature non-linear or significantly branching gameplay that make subsequent re-visits an enjoyable proposition. Next, you've got Fighters, where the complexity of the underlying fighting engine drives the player to master all of the moves. Finally, we have Linear Action, or games that have been specifically tailored to suck quarters and provide a quick adrenaline rush.  One of these categories should definitely not be ported straight to a console without major improvements. Can you guess which one it is?  If you chose Linear Action, give yourself a hand! And do your best to avoid Charge N Blast, a criminally short-lived shooter that should never have seen the light of day on the Dreamcast. Based on an aging arcade game, the Dreamcast rendition of Charge N Blast brings home all of the coin-op action, along with the full twenty minutes' worth of gameplay. Hot damn!  You're introduced to the world of Charge N Blast through the needlessly melodramatic opening cutscene, where loveable rogue ~John Dawn~ dons his cool power armor, and talks about his Agency-assigned duty of blasting evil bugs who invade Earth via sinister, incoming meteors. Smack the start button, select one of three characters, and get ready to charge and blast until the cows come home!  The game starts off in ~The City of Nest,~ where enormous, oh-so-evil alien bugs are raising hell. Your job is to nuke 'em all with one of three weapons ? your arsenal includes lock-on projectiles (a la Panzer Dragoon), fire-and-forget ~dumb~ missiles, and mega-powerful tactical warheads. To send these projectiles into the cranium of a nearby beastie, you have to hold down the X, Y, or B button to charge up your weapon to maximum power, target with the D-pad, then fire by pressing A. The longer you charge, the more damage the resulting shot does ? but you'll be more succeptable to attack while you wait, so don't dally about.   From time to time, the critters that you need to blast will toss themselves towards you in a kamikaze attack. When this happens, just squeeze the L and R triggers ? you'll strafe to the left or right. You'll know when to evade, since your helpful on-board computer matter-of-factly states ~The enemies are attacking. Dodge them.~ Unfortunately, the computer says this every time that your enemies attack, which is once every three seconds or so. It gets a wee bit tedious.  The charging system is a mite tricky at first, but you'll probably get it after two or three playthroughs. And once you do get your technique nailed down, it won't take long to beat the game ? with its pitiful number of stages, you can easily plow through the entire game in under 20 minutes. It looks like everything remains the same each time you play it, too, so don't expect any branching levels or surprises. In order to add something that resembles ~replay value,~ the developers were so kind as to include a Time Attack mode where you're forced to beat the clock, and a Ranking Mode, which grades you on your performance. If you're feeling daring, you can head to the options screen and swap the gameplay from third-person to a first-person perspective, which makes things considerably more difficult. You can also turn on the ~Viblation~ function, which gives you exciting force feedback! We're really reaching here, aren't we?  While the game is short and has little to no replay value, it does look remotely decent. The graphic design isn't bad, and the three selectable mecha suits are beyond cool. The boss design is distinctive enough, with a giant robo-octopuses and fire-spewing Godzilla clones. The game moves at 60fps, though everything promptly drops to 30fps whenever something explodes. Now that's quality programming.  At its core, Charge and Blast isn't an awful game, but it could definitely stand to be anywhere from five to ten times the length of its current incarnation. Unless you're completely psycho over 3D shoot-em-ups, leave this one on the shelf, and blow your cash on an import that won't take you an hour to beat. -- Colin ~blasts without charging~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 16, 2000"}
