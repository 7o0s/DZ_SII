Now, publisher Starwave and developer Lightplay are kicking off the promo blitz with a mobile game based on the film's action sequences. Is this a treasure worth unearthing?   Features:   Based on film  Three levels   Well, if the headline didn't give you a hint as to what we think of National Treasure, here's what you can expect: A mediocre action game that offers zero innovation, created only to capitalize on a brand name and hopefully bolster consumer awareness for the upcoming movie. Cynical? Yes, but after tromping through the game's meager three levels after never once really ~enjoying~ the game, it's going to be impossible recommend.   The game takes its cues from three action sequences in the film -- an old ship, the National Archives, and a series of catacombs. In the old ship, you must break barrels with a crowbar, locating keys that open doors between the boat's decks. And the ship is one fire, so you must leap over burning planks and watch for falling fireballs from the ceiling. Many offer zero warning, so it's a matter of entering a deck and immediately running to prevent yourself from being clubbed.   The second level is in a series of hallways beneath the national archives. Now you must use a series of ventilation shafts on the ceiling to creep over impassable obstacles. In addition to ceiling work, you can also attempt stealth by flipping switches to turn lights off. Hide in the shadows until a guard passes, then either make your break and zap him with a stun gun.   The third level is in some old catacombs where you must hunt down the final treasure. There is more puzzle solving elements in here, as you must look for floor switches that open grates. Your goal is to uncover the titular national treasure.   As mentioned, at no point does this game ever really entertain. It's just an action game going through the motions. We were immediately reminded of two of Lightplay's previous games: Dual Threat and Ben Chase: Treasure Hunter. Except National Treasure doesn't offer anything those games didn't, and in fact, it's almost a step backwards from both.   Control is actually fine. It's your basic cellphone action game set-up, with ~up~ assigned to jumping, and the number keys performing actions.   Visually, National Treasure is dull -- even on the LGVX7000, which can actually host far better graphics. The in-game sprites are simple and lacking in detail and the animation isn't very fluid. The sound is minimal, save for an opening theme and just a few in-game noises.National Treasure is an average game. Two years ago, average got the job done, but the industry has moved so far forward it's difficult to look at a game like National Treasure and see anything to crow about. The game wallows in its own mediocrity. This is nothing more than a movie game that hopes to cash in on name alone. Lightplay is a talented game studio that has produced some good efforts in the past. Hopefully they'll strike this from their resume.", "date": "Oct 23, 2004"}
