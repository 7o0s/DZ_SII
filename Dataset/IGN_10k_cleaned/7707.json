The only problem with that theory is that the same guy is behind both games, Dr. Ryuta Kawashima. So, in a way, the good doctor is copying himself and he does a pretty bad job of it. If you want to have a rougher and less fun version of Brain Age, then Mind Quiz is the one for you.   Where Brain Age has a fun and innovative interface with creative use of the stylus, Mind Quiz is instead a pretty stale series of multiple choice questions. Perhaps it's not fair to say that people should buy another system to play a game, but really get a DS and play the original instead. The spirit is somewhat alive here, but only in the faint sort of way that you know it could've been so much better.    The brain training is done through different groups of challenges that feel like ways that a struggling parent tries to make some boring chore ~fun!~ by giving it a different name. Like remembering phone numbers? Then you'll love memorizing 5-digit numbers over and over and over and... Well, you get the point. These are the memory type of questions and there's also math, word, and puzzle games to try out too.   These other types of games have some good qualities to them, but they all suffer from poor pacing and a tendency to repeat questions. Instead of ramping up the level of difficulty for the questions, this is a matter of doing the same exact task over and over and over. Oh wait, did I say that already? Must be the nature of the game getting through to me.   Surely repetition is not necessarily a bad thing for building skills as these are really mental exercises to keep you sharp as the doctor would surely attest to. The other problem is that the whole package around the challenges is so hastily done that this feels like a rush job. Badly drawn characters and a bizarre world tour mode where you must travel through several countries for no real reason. For a game that's supposed to be played for short periods of time, the long world tour just doesn't fit in.   The main advantage of Mind Quiz seems to be that most of the challenges here are new to those who have played Brain Age, but they also feel like the leftover scraps that have been collected together. The challenges of counting cubes and following a path for animals to take are here, but that's about it. Oddly enough, the pathfinding challenge isn't even explained here. It seems like the developers are assuming you've played the DS version before. It's a bad choice since this game pales in comparison.Mind Quiz was clearly shoved out the door with the doctor's permission to ride the wave of popularity that his DS game has been basking in. The problem is that while the core gameplay is here, the rest of the charm and style is completely gone. This is a soulless clone that clumsily goes where its siblings have gone before. It pretty much does the job, but it can hardly be recommended for just that.", "date": "Nov 30, 2006"}
