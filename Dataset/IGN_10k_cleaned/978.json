These were the emotions and desires of this game.~   What the!?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... TIME OUT!!!  Space Channel 5 is a game in which you mimic button presses on your controller in synch with an on-screen beat, all in an effort to stop the invading Moroliens from forcing innocent bystanders to dance mindlessly.  A cute concept, but where is this ~message~ you speak of, Miz-san?  And then I played the game through to completion, and I finally understood just what Mizuguchi was talking about.  I identified the peace and the love he'd spoken of, noted towards the end of the game that I was inspired like rarely before, and made an attempt to count the number of times I'd smiled uncontrollably while playing.  Mizuguchi's space game (he's a ~space game producer,~ afterall) is one of the most memorable gaming experiences ever, and a title that everyone should play through from start to end.  That's a pretty surprising statement when you consider that the game portion (ie, the parts where you push and pull things on the controller) is not without its own share of icky problems.  You already know the basics, as you might have checked out our preview of the Japanese version, review of the Japanese version and preview of the English version (whew... overkill!), but here's a quick recap.  You play as Ulala, a spunky, sassy, spandex-clad space reporter (yes, all adjectives for Ulala must begin with ~S~) working at Space Channel 5 in the far future.  The dreaded Morolien race has invaded a space colony, and you've been sent over to cover the event and save the peaceful colony residents from the Moroliens' attempts at making them dance mindlessly.  You do so sometimes by out-dancing the Moroliens, and sometimes by zapping them to who-knows where while zapping the brainwashed humans to your side.  The entirety of the game's four multi-sectioned stages features gameplay of the simon-says variety - ie, you hear a button combination, something of the form ~Left - Right - Left - Right - Chu - Chu - Chu~ (~chu~ is how 'em Japanese fokels say ~shoot,~ and Sega's kept it like that for the US release), and you must mimic that, taking timing into account.  It's simple stuff - not deceptively simple, mind you, just simple.  But like all good rhythm games, the later stages ask that you work with trickier patterns, including off beat and blazingly fast cues.   The gameplay at its best almost convinces you that you're doing more than just following what an onscreen character is telling you to do.  Don't be surprised if you actually find yourself moving to the beat in some fashion (it's a requirement for me, and I'm damn proud of it).  The game also transcends the abstract nature of its simon-says gameplay.  When Ulala is asked to go ~Left - Chu - Right - Chu - Up - Chu - Chu,~ even if you didn't hear the voice, you're still able to figure out what to press in what order, as you've just witnessed a Moroloien appear to the left, followed by a Morolien to the right, then two more above.  Some of the boss encounters make even more clever use of this strangely realistic style  The rewards for doing things correctly are many, including new paths, new characters joining your ever-growing procession (and subsequently being added to the game's character database), and notable changes to the background music.  Do bad, and Ulala will grow lethargic, as will the soundtrack and game motion as a whole for just a bit.  Of course, you can't do too bad, as progressing to the next level requires some degree of competence.  Unfortunately, those trying to perfect the game will encounter some serious problems with timing.  There's an occasional lag between when you press a button and when something happens on screen, and this often leads to frustration as you wonder if an error registered by the game was your fault or just the game choking up.  The game seems to be improved over its Japanese counterpart in most ways, but it still happens way too often - maybe a bit more time could've been used to clean things up.  The game also suffers from Sega's age-old problem of giving us too short an experience.  The four levels end up going by rather quickly, and while there is always the goal of improving your score and meeting up with every single character in the game, a couple of extra levels would help immensely.  There's certainly room for more advanced patterns to truly test your rhythm quotient - guess we'll have to wait for the next game to see the gameplay form (whose name I'm coining as ~Visual Simon Says~) more fully exploited.   Despite these problems and the very simple gameplay, Space Channel 5 manages to shine based on the other elements of the game, primarily on the presentation side.  The stylized worlds which blend the '60s with outer space, have become legendary since the game's unveiling almost one year back, and are presented in the highest detail imaginable.  The Dreamcast is actually spooling the backgrounds off the GD-ROM as pre-rendered MPEGs, and although the video quality is occasionally somewhat dirty, particularly on S-Video, the effect works surprisingly well.  The characters are the only bits that are coming our way in full realtime 3D, and they're constructed seamlessly, with any crease and bend looking to be out of design more than anything.  The game's lead cast is a memorable crew with unique designs - they collectively have the potential to be a Sonic the Hedgehog 'n Crew for a grown-up audience.  Best of all, Sega of America has given everyone a full voice over job with excellent results.  Apollo Smile, the live action anime girl herlsef, is excellent as Ulala, but real props must be given to Dave Nowlin, the voice of Fuse - this guy knows his stuff.  The other main voices, including Jeff Kramer as Jaguar, Sumalee Montano as Pudding and Gary Martinez as Blank lack a bit in the enthusiasm department, but are still better than most.  And I've forgotten to mention the best part of the game, its sound.  I've experienced the sounds of Ys Book 1 and 2, Panzer Dragoon, and Lords of Thunder, but dare I suggest that Space Channel 5 features the finest soundtrack ever in a game?  In addition to the music fitting the game's visual style flawlessly (or maybe it's the other way around), the sound manages to be a technical marvel, with dynamic effects like guitar and keyboard tracks brought on when characters join your procession.  Building on the character, music, and style, the game manages to bring us some of the most memorable moments ever in a game.  We all have our share of moments we cling to from our favorite games.  Fighting Seven Force in Gunstar Heroes, the moment where Azel and Edge are falling in Panzer Dragoon Saga, the billion times you managed to find a new dungeon or open a door in Zelda - you know what I'm talking about.  Space Channel 5 is full of those, and it all builds up to easily the most inspiring ending sequence ever.  I think back on all the incredible games I've played on all the various systems out there, and I can't imagine myself having smiled and laughed more than with Space Channel 5.  And that's what Mizuguchi was talking about, claiming to have built the message of love, peace, and happiness into a game in which you zap florescent teletubbies, although there's also a more literal message contained within the game's story itself.  Pick up Space Channel 5 and try to overlook the gameplay problems, and you'll understand Mizuguchi's message as well.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Jun 2, 2000"}
