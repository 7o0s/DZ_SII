Sure, they cost a hell of a lot more than the likes of G.I. Joe and Hot Wheels, but last time I checked there was one key difference.  A miniature, die-cast metal car doesn't require a team of 20, a couple years, and a few million dollars to get on the shelves, so I guess it all evens out. Besides, you can just bring so much more to life with imagination, and with games getting more and more realistic, we're seeing some pretty crazy stuff.   Still, there's something I miss about setting up an elaborate army of military madmen who are ready to give their all to take out the enemy, even if it mean ~covering~ an incoming m-80 with their body. (Did I mention that I was a little sadistic as a kid?).  And as much as I enjoyed cruising down the highway when I had a car, it was never quite as cool as my collection of Matchboxes. Maybe it was because I could be so over the top, or perhaps it was the fact that my car was a Toyota POS, but it just never had the same flair.  So was I intrigued when I first saw No Cliche's Toy Commander?  Oh, hell yeah.  I mean, someone was developing a toy sim!  How cool of an idea is that? Tons of vehicles, varying missions, and sweet visuals to boot.  Let me at it!  And attack it I did. Toy Commander made its way into the office a few weeks ago, and I finally pried away from the ~real world~ long enough to give it a good solid look this weekend, and man, was it worth it.  It's been a long time since I sat down a game this unique, innovative, and engrossing, and the more I play, the more I'm amazed by this game's level of creativity.  The game takes takes its innovative theme and runs with it, and you'll get an instant kick out of how clever the design is.  For each level, missions take place in a particular the room, such as the bedroom or the kitchen, but you'd swear you were in a totally different world.  This is thanks largely to the fact that each mission is distinct and creative, from recapturing defectors with your personnel truck to making hot cocoa with a helicopter and a jeep.  I just can't tell you how friggin' cool it is to go through a mission and actually feel like you're a race car driver or a fearless fighter pilot, all the while knowing that you're in a fully realized house, and that you're just a toy.  This game just oozes personality, and you'll instantly fall in love with the killer atmosphere.   The strong sense of atmosphere can be attributed in large part to the game's subtle but spectacular visuals.  I know the game looks kinda simple, but it's alive with color, and makes great use of the hardware.  I still remember the first time I saw the level fly-by in a ~night-time~ level.  A blazing frame-rate, incredible lighting, sharp models, and surprising realism and continuity all help make this one of the best visual showcases this generation has seen to date.  The same could be said of the game's level design.  Several games have tried to make gamers ~feel~ small, and I've certainly been impressed by the likes of Re-Volt and Army Men, but nothing will prepare you for Toy Commander.  Like I said, each room is home to several missions, but you easily forget this because each level is so well done.  It's like the room just transforms into whatever it needs to be. Common childhood toys like racecar tracks, wine glasses, and cleaning products don't just appear in levels, they help shape them.  To make things even cooler, gravity can't hold down your imagination, and the level designers often make use of every single surface. I won't waste any more time trying to tell you how this all works, but let me assure you it is sweet.  The only thing that surpasses the missions' diversity are the game's vehicles.  Just about every gadget you've seen in the toy store is here, and each one has its own look and feel.  Unfortunately, one of >Toy Commander's lone low points comes in the way these vehicles handle. The camera seems to get a bit confused when you get stuck or get closed in, and this is further complicated by the fact that your side-to-side controls are reversed when you back up.  You can change this in the menus, but when you invert them, the game just feels unnatural. Regardless of how I tried to pick it up, I got completely frustrated at times, as you can actually push the opposite direction and continue to turn the same way which is just plain wrong, and it happens more often than I'd care to see. To top it off, you have to become a master of the game's controls to keep from falling off ledges.  And, of course, falling off ledges means instant death to any hopes of beating the top mission times, which happens to be the key to advancing.  Which brings up the other key problem with the game.  Despite its kiddie theme, Toy Commander is not for kids.  At times, it's downright impossible.  Most of the time, the game finds a nice balance between challenging and competitively frustrating.  You know, the type of balance where you get angry enough with the game that you decide you'll beat the little $%#@$# at all costs.  But occasionally, you'll face a mission that's way over the top.  I'm sorry, but when a boss is easier than a level two missions down, it seems clear that the balance needs to be worked on just a bit.  Thankfully, you can still advance through the missions, but you don't get the sense of completeness you would if it was just a tad bit easier. In the end, though, the problem with difficulty didn't keep me from enjoying the experience, and I still find myself wanting more. But the thing is, I feel that with a bit more fluent control and a slightly less difficult path to completion, this would have been the killer app for the Dreamcast. As it stands now, it is still a must-have title, but Toy Commander lacks the polish expected from a game that has so many other things right. If you like games that are both challenging and distinct, you'll want to pick this one up, but prepare to get a little pissed off.  Thankfully, the high points far outweigh the lows, and ultimately you'll get over the game's inconsistencies.  Give it a shot, gang. Opening the toy box has never been this much fun.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 5, 1999"}
