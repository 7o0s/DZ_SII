This year marks the first time the popular gridiron series hits the Game Boy system in full color  and for what it is, Madden 2000 is a damn good version of portable football, despite some odd quirks. Features  Single-player game Four play modes  Complete statistics for all teams and players Injuries Password system to save progress For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Don't expect the same game that the big guys (read: PlayStation, N64, and PC systems) got a couple months ago  Game Boy developer Tiertex had a lot of restrictions to work with to get all 22 players on the field at the same time (11 on a team). Not only this, but the team also had to convert the semi-complex controls of the Genesis original onto the more restrictive two button configuration of the Game Boy system. But with all the shoe-horning that went on in this conversion, the game came out really well.  The Game Boy game also marks the return of the passing windows you may remember from the Genesis days  when you want to pass, you bring up a series of three windows showing your available receivers. As you maneuver your quarterback behind the line of scrimmage, you cycle through the windows by tapping that same button. Find the open receiver and let it launch. This interface is a bit clunky at first, but after a few games you'll get the hang of it. You can also set up two plays at the beginning of the game to be your audible plays  a nice addition to the interface, especially when you want to psych out the opposition.  You'll have to put up with the extremely tiny character graphics  there's no real detail in the animation, so it's difficult to see when you actually catch the ball. It's obvious the game could have flowed a lot smoother if it was programmed with the Game Boy Color specifically in mind. But instead, the game was made to be backward compatible with the older Game Boys, so you'll have to put up with slightly choppy scrolling of the field tiles.  The AI is the big deal in any football game, and yes, you can still find the perfect play and use it over and over and over again  I haven't found a football videogame yet that I couldn't do this.  The huge downside is the lack of multiplayer. This is only a single player game. It's understandable why the developers couldn't do it (too many character positions to send through the somewhat slow link-cable)  but it's still a bit disappointing that you won't be able to hook up with a friend and go at it on the road.As far as portable football titles go, I'm really surprised how well Madden 2000 came out. It controls well, doesn't look terrible, and it's a fun diversion. I've been spoiled by NFL Blitz (not the Game Boy Color game, the arcade and console versions), so I'm used to quicker playing games. But you folks out there who can't get enough of the real thing will like having a decent version for the road.", "date": "Nov 6, 1999"}
