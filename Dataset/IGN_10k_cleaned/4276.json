Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy might get  all the glory, many of us were introduced to Middle Earth via the author's first work in the series, the prequel following the adventures of young Bilbo Baggins in ~The Hobbit.~ Or if you skipped the book, chances are you saw the cartoon from the late 70s by Rankin & Bass. Or perhaps you might've even been lucky enough to hear Leonard Nimoy's moving ~The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins.~ Regardless, the story is preferred by many to the trilogy itself, and follows Bilbo as he helps out a group of dwarfs, battles ogres, dragons, encounters Gollum and so on. And ya know what? It actually does a pretty good job of it.  Produced by Saffire, the minds behind several GBA titles as well as the Brood Wars add-on to PC's Starcraft, Sierra's The Hobbit is a pretty all-around solid actioner for the GBA with rich environments and some decent puzzling thrown in as well. In it, you play Bilbo as he helps out a band of dwarves (as well as a McKellen-less Gandalf, though he does still bear a slight resemblance), battle the dragon Smaug and swipe that ring from pathetic old Gollum. The game is presented in a perspective similar to the recent Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge -- a sort of 3/4 perspective, but with more emphasis placed on vertical objects like walls and trees. While this viewpoint does obscure the natural look of the environments (everything has sort of a squashed appearance), it does give a decent amount of depth to each setting and maximizes what the player can see. In a game where much of the action involves shuffling up walls and into caverns as forest beasties give pursuit, a solid perspective is essential.  The world itself is fairly well done, with interior areas in particular, like caves and hobbit homes gushing personality. Objects like rocks and trees are expertly done, though some of the more prominent details such as the plains, water and hills have a somewhat low-color jagged look, reminiscent of old PC titles. Rather than hand-drawn sprites, the game sports rendered characters, presumably from the console models. While rendered art in GBA titles often leaves everything with a blurry, mushy look, it works here. Bilbo creeps, slashes, rolls and runs very fluidly in eight directions and larger sprites, such as the ogres you encounter early on look simply gorgeous. The sheer  amount of animations you find is staggering, especially when you acquire some of the later weapons.  The background artwork in the game is not entirely cohesive, however; You can see tile edges very evidently, and some areas look more repetitious than others. But on the whole, and especially considering how much variety in enemies and objects there are, the graphics do very well. And while not particularly taxing on the GBA's capabilities, the game does throw some nice ambiance at you with flash rainstorms now and then.  Regarding gameplay, Bilbo spends much of the game playing whipping boy to the various folk he encounters...go find me this, go climb there, open that door for me. While the areas you explore in the game are vast, the quests are for the most part broken down into very minute, linear objectives. This makes for a very easy playing experience (chances are you'll never be clueless about where to go next), but it would have been nice to explore Middle Earth a bit more freely without running into blocked areas you must overcome section by section. Along the way you also run into constant little enemies (and not-so little ones) you must deal with and yes, Gollum's in there, too. Boss battle are fun, though not particularly inventive for the most part.  The game has been compared to the Zelda titles, and there definitely does seem to be some influence from  those games, as you trudge about each landscapes attacking creatures and looking for dungeon-like locales. But a more apt comparison might be to call the game Ico-lite. Like the PS2 game you'll run from area to area, fending off beasts as you struggle to turn switches and solve mini-puzzles to unlock the next area, the next puzzle and so on.  A game like this could get old fast, and I must admit that it never seems particularly epic, in part due to the fact that you take your journey one baby step at a time. The story is presented through Bilbo's interaction with others, and little popup dialogues that are not all that fascinating nor compelling. You objectives do however get a little more interesting as you progress in the game, and even when the game is at its most chore-like (I have to wonder why Bilbo should bother clearing out a house of rats when there's epic journeys to be made) it's still well designed enough to be worth the play.  In the sound department, the game fares pretty well. Cheerful little shire tunes match the gameplay, and don't really detract nor enhance your experience. The sound effects work very well with a pretty hefty assortment of samples, although quite a few of Bilbo's clips sound oddly enough like he's vomiting. The presentation value of the game is light, but solid. Menus are used to select which items to equip and not much else.  While three save files are thankfully included, the developers did play it pretty light with the saving locations. You record Bilbo's progress only upon encountering little books strewn about the game, and you can trek pretty far between each book. I also noticed that the game is a little inconsistent about where you restart after dying...sometimes I'd respawn on the same screen I perished, but sometimes I'd be a good five minutes back, even sometimes farther back than my last save point. Perhaps anticipating how challenging the lack of abundance in these departments might make the game, Saffire has very smartly included a Sleep Mode in the game, quite possibly the most important yet underused feature the GBA has. So if you need to take a break, even mid-battle just pause and select this function, and your game will be waiting for you when you return. All in all, the game is a decent addition to the Tolkien game archive. While a bit light on the 'wow' factor, the weapons system and puzzles are handled well enough to keep you playing until the end. The game has all the elements of a great quest -- what keeps it a bit lacking though is that nothing you do in the game really feels all that important. It's an enjoyable time, but most of the battles and quests feel rather trivial. However the art and sound, while at times a bit disjointed were certainly well thought-out and flesh out your little hobbit world quite nicely.", "date": "Dec 2, 2003"}
