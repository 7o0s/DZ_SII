Historically, it's been a strictly European affair, although that's changed a little in recent years with the introduction of Japanese competitors like Nissan and Toyota, and to a lesser degree the Viper GTS-R and Oldsmobile efforts.  The only winning American entries in the 24 Hours were in the late 60s, when Carroll Shelby decided to make Ferrari's ass his and Lee Iacocca decided that would make for a neat marketing gimmick.  This isn't to say GT doesn't have its fans here, though - like F1 racing, the circuit has serious followers all over the world.  It is they, I think, who would most appreciate Test Drive Le Mans.  What it offers is a particular atmosphere and style of racing, rather than the more complete racing experience of something like Gran Turismo 2 - what it lacks in breadth, it makes up for in precision.  It features the fully-licensed cars, tracks, and teams of endurance GT racing, along with a solid gameplay and progression system.  Unfortunately, it's the graphics that rather stick out the first time you boot up Test Drive Le Mans.  After seeing Gran Turismo 2, it doesn't really stack up.  The tracks and cars look good enough, but the 3D engine is a little shaky, the texture resolution is lower than average, and the in-game effects aren't all that impressive.  Nighttime replays have some nice lens flare effects coming from headlights, and in fact the experience of driving at night is replicated pretty well through lighting, but things like highlighting and reflection mapping are sadly missed.  What's left looks good - the many licensed cars are pretty nicely replicated, complete with sponsor decals and other little details, and there are a few neat trackside touches like video screens displaying the race - but theses are definitely not A-list looks.  Those willing to look beyond the graphics may find that this is still a game worth playing, though.  The actual driving is pretty nicely done.  There two modes, amateur and professional, letting you decide how much realism you feel like at any given time.  Amateur plays more or less like the mainline Test Drive series, letting you take corners at speed and not worry too much about collisions; professional clamps down and requires you to follow the racing line and apply your brakes intelligently.  Car damage also becomes a matter of concern in the professional mode.  In amateur mode, you should only need to hit the pits for an occasional refueling, whereas in professional mode, too much contact with other cars or the walls will definitely mandate repairs, and tire wear is also a factor.  Speaking of the pits, that part of the game is quite well-handled.  You're presented with a menu of options, and you select the ones you need while a timer ticks away.  The quicker you can manipulate the menu, the less time your car spends in the pits, which is a neat representation of the speed a real pit requires.  Developing your skills and working your way through the championship mode allows you to graduate into more powerful cars and classes.  In between racing seasons, you get e-mail from different teams offering promotions or new positions, which is another nice little touch of realism.  The different cars and three different classes (GT2, GT1, and Prototype) each present a very different feel - more powerful cars are more difficult to handle, and downforce definitely feels like a factor in performance.  The tracks are a nicely varied mix, and while the lack of an in-race map is a little annoying (you have to learn the curves with a little trial and error), the well-done pre-race flyovers offer a good introduction.  And then, of course, there is the 24-hour mode, which poses a bit of a dilemma for the reviewer.  In case you're wondering, it's exactly what it sounds like: a realtime recreation of the GT circuit's crown jewel, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, lasting (you guessed it) a full 24 hours.  It's hard for me to consider this an asset to the game, when from my point of view nobody in their right mind would ever want to play through the mode, but some would say I have a moral obligation to try it out in order to give the game a completely fair hearing.  However, I am going to kick that moral obligation in the head, on what I consider to be quite firm grounds; i.e., I have a great many better things to do with my time.  I'll just say that the 24-hour mode is there, complete with a realistic day-night cycle, and those of you mad enough to want to play through it are welcome to give it a shot.  Actually, we'd love to receive reports from those who've managed to win the entire thing.  Even if you don't go through the 24-hour challenge, there's enough racing left over in the other parts of the game that you probably won't get too bored.  There are also some other nice presentation aspects to liven things up.  For example, this is an Infogrames game, made primarily for consumption in the European market, so you can play it in different languages: English, Spanish, and French.  The neat part of this is that the text isn't the only part that's translated - if you get tired of the constipated British guy doing the English in-race voice commentary (incidentally, what is it with constipated British guys doing commentary in racing games?  I was just about to smash my TV in after half an hour of V-Rally 2...), you can skip over to a new language.    It's the details that make Test Drive Le Mans more fun than the slightly iffy graphics might make you think.  Gran Turismo 2 is a far more complete simulation racer, and there are perhaps better options as far as arcade-style racing is concerned.  In other words, this is probably not the best choice if you're only going to buy one racing game for your PlayStation.  But it handles its specific subject matter quite well - Le Mans followers, and others with an interest in trying out this particular style of racing, shouldn't be disappointed.  Comments:  I came into Test Drive Le Mans with pretty low expectations - I can't help being a little dubious after seeing a fistful of mediocre games with the once-proud Test Drive name slapped on them.  However, even though Test Drive Le Mans isn't a real Test Drive game, assuming you can even define what that is anymore, it's a fine Le Mans game, which is the important part.  Eutechnyx has crafted a varied, yet consistent driving experience, and what the license has to offer has been used quite well.  And if nothing else, the 24-hour mode is...well-intentioned, I guess.  -- David Smith Test Drive comes off like an extremely mediocre arcade game that, yet again, suffers from a bit of an identity crisis. I'm not sure if the physics were arcadey and the gameplay was too much like a driving sim or if it's the other way around, but the two don't synch up the way they should. With so many other racing options already available on the Xbox and more on the way before the end of 2002, it's hard to find a place where Test Drive truly belongs. Test Drive's career mode is the strongest element and worth a look, but Burnout does pure arcade action better, Rallisport Challenge simulates driving better and Project Gotham Racing straddles the fence better than Test Drive does. I'd recommend it as a poor man's version of PGR, but that penniless bastard has to cough up the same $50 to play it so it's not really an option.", "date": "May 24, 2000"}
