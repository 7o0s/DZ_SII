EA Mobile's Madden NFL 06 can be considered a let-down -- at least, the high-end 3D edition. Glu Mobile's FOX Sports Football 06 offered only minor updates to the previous edition, and with the franchise showing age, the results weren't terribly exciting. Neither of those games are bad, per se, but mobile quarterbacks are still waiting to have their hair blown back.   THQ Wireless' itty-bitty gridiron game is not the end-all footballer, but it is certainly a step up from its competition. The game improves on a few elements from the previous year's edition, as well as delivers additional new features that healthily round out the game's appeal. There are certainly a couple issues I have with the game, such as some stuttering animation, some lazy plays on the field, and one total boner of a call -- but they do not overpower the game's shining points. They just put a little dull on them.   NFL Football 2006 features a full NFL license and makes the best use of it we've seen so far this year. Football inspires emotional attachments on order with baseball, and being able to actually play as your favorite team means a lot. Even better, THQ has secured all of the player names, so when you make a successful play as the Vikings, for example, the on-screen ticker gives credit to those involved -- such as Culpepper. That's a nice touch, and THQ Wireless has even set up a system where gamers can download roster updates to make sure everything feels fresh.   THQ's game is definitely a more sim experience than, say, Glu's more arcade-style footballer. Normally, an abundance of sim mechanics can turn me off -- especially on a mobile game that is supposed to be easily digestible -- but the way things are handled here works quite smoothly. The 11-on-11 play doesn't crowd the screen as bad as I thought it would, even on the narrow screen of a LG VX7000. It helps that the player models are somewhat small that they fit on the screen (at the sacrifice of detail, though), but the way it was so easy to cycle through players, makes up for it.   NFL Football 2006 tracks a lot of stats, too. While you're playing the full sixteen game season, the game keeps a tally on passes, yards, etc. Again, things like this are of great importance to big fans -- so again, THQ delivers. After each game, NFL Football 2006 awards a Player of the Game to one of the game's participants, so if you're juicing stats and making big plays, expect to see the POG awarded to someone on your team.   The inclusion of the Pro Bowl is another good touch. While playing a full season, you can check to see how many of your players have qualified for the big game in Hawaii. Again, this has no bearing on me, but I know two football fans that would get glass-cutters over details like that.   NFL Football 2006 has pretty good control. I like the ease of cycling to the player closest to the action. While on defense, if you press ~OK~ after a pass is thrown, the game automatically switches you to the player closest to the receiver. This makes it easy to disrupt passes, or even better, make an interception. The easy to use dive button is also a good way to clobber a receiver and make him fumble.   When on offense, the game uses a standard ~*,~ ~0,~ and ~#~ system for making passes. Those symbols are attached to receivers and will turn green, yellow, or red depending on how likely you are to complete the pass. It's an easy system to use, and I also found it really comfortable -- one hand on the thumbpad, the other on the bottom row of numbers. This cuts down on the number of times you accidentally press ~END~ when you meant to press ~3.~   The computer AI is pretty consistent. I fooled it sometimes, and sometimes it fooled me. I totally lulled it into thinking I would always pass by doing it over and over, only to hand off the ball for a running play that resulted in a touchdown because the computer was caught with its pants down. Even better, in the next game I was unable to pull that little trick off.   Now, I did mention a few issues I had while playing. Sometimes it feels like the computer (and your receivers) is wearing cement shoes. Inexplicably they would just stand there or move so slowly I was able to make an easy tackle. When I play the Raiders versus the Vikings, I don't expect that sort of thing to happen. Sometimes in these moments, the animation would stutter, like the receiver was doing the ~running man~ with a little herky-jerky. That's jarring and annoying. Another questionable moment? I was sacked for a loss of -- wait for this -- 150 yards. Apparently, I had run all the way out to the parking lot and waited by my car for the defensive line to run me down -- even though it looked a lot like, maybe, a 13-yard loss. Are these deal-breakers? No. But they are disappointing to see in an otherwise polished package.   NFL Football 2006 does use smaller players to fit full squads on the field, and thusly, there is a big loss in detail. The uniform colors are correct, but by being so small, you get only a few pixels for arms and legs. The number on the back of the uniform is just a shotgun blast of black pixels. The animations aren't awfully detailed either, but it does looking like running and passing and diving, so even though it won't win any awards, it does get the point across. The game has some little jingles as well as grunts that accompany big action.  NFL Football 2006 is a good footballer, and so far, it's a bit better than the competition. (I'm going to post a preview of JAMDAT's footballer shortly.) Some of the hiccups are annoying, but there is also much the game does right -- such as making excellent use of the NFL license and offering solid, tight, and comfy control. Of the three football games you can get so far, I'd recommend NFL Football 2006 over the other two. After we see the final contender, I'll weigh in with a pre-season report card of the best of the bunch -- but I can tell you know that THQ's NFL Football 2006 isn't going to fall below the number two spot.", "date": "Aug 20, 2005"}
