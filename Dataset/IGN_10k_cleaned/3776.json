Space Spyder by Spot Wireless is one of those teeny-tiny games -- but did it deserve to be picked up by SEGA.  And more so, does it really deserve your few bucks?    Features:  Top-down scrolling action  ~Auto Save~ protects high scores    Space Spyder is a cosmic adventure starring a alloy-skinned spider that must navigate a series of space labyrinths, working from one goal to the next.  Your greatest foe is the cold, black void -- cause it spidey falls off the platform, it's a long way down to nothing at all.  The space platforms are constantly scrolling underneath your legs, so there's no stopping.  You must look ahead and chart a course while trying to maintain your current position on the board.    Most of the mazes are battleship gray, which you can runs across at normal speed.  Be on the lookout for Technicolor squares can temporarily imbue your arachnid with superpowers such as speed and high jumps, or hinder movement.  A handy-dandy menu at the start of the game will tell you which squares to avoid while piloting your space spider... er, spyder.    You always want to space sashay across the rainbow-hued square, though.  Collect four of these to receive level bonuses.  Of course, these squares are sometimes inconveniently placed in the maze, requiring you to jump across chasms to reach them or perform a number of tricky little maneuvers.    The sad bottom line, though, is that Space Spyder is just not all that fun.  The pace of the game is terribly slow.  Your spider literally crawls across these platforms, never raising the pulse from close calls.  Nevermind that the control is fairly sluggish, too.  You're constantly laying on the touchpad or joystick (we tried it on a Samsung N400) to get anywhere, pressing down harder and harder out of hope that the itsy-bitsy spider will show some get-up and go.    Worse still is the absolutely boring visuals.  Now, nobody goes into first-gen cellphone games expecting something of the caliber of, say, and Game Boy Advance game, but Space Spyder is about as rudimentary as you can get, with dull sprites decorated with dull colors.  Audio is fairly non-existent, too, with just a small assortment of bloops and beeps to accent what little action there is.Want to know just how boring Space Spyder is?  I downloaded it while sitting on a chair while my girlfriend shopped for a dress for her sister's wedding.  And I ended up preferring to watch her fret over whether the dress with the pink or yellow sash looked best.", "date": "Jul 14, 2003"}
