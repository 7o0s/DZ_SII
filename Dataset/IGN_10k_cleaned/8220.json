In fact, you've probably spent many a lazy sunny day, casually tossing husks of dried crust at their poor defenceless heads, in the spirit of arbitrary altruism. Put it this way though: if real ducks were anything like as mind-boggling annoying as their pixel counterparts in Super Rub'a'Dub, you'd be swapping your Hovis for a nail gun in no time.    In fact, as casual games go, Sony Europe has done a staggering job at creating one of the most pointless, soulless and - most importantly - infuriating titles we've seen in a while. This one's more likely to have your dear old mother hurling the PS3 through your fancy new 40-inch hi-def telly than it is encouraging a glassy-eyed state of catatonia after half a bottle of wine once Corrie's finished.   Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves though. In principle, Super Rub'a'Dub is quite an appealing idea. Simply, you're tasked with guiding a rubber duck around a bath-like maze in a quest to free your tiny plastic brethren from their bubble prisons and guide them to the plug hole exit. Of course, as usual, it's not quite that straightforward. As with Monkey Ball et al, rather than controlling the protagonist directly, tilting the SIXAXIS controller affects the lay of the water-logged level. Tilt right and water cascades in that direction, sending your tiny duck friends bobbing off accordingly. Further complicating matters are low walls threatening a plunge into oblivion, sharks with a penchant for nibbling on rubber flesh and other level-based obstacles requiring crafty navigation via controller-flicking jumps.    Success requires your completing a level within a set time limit. The goal is to hang onto each of your freed ducks (which form a polite line and follow your route) and dump the whole lot back at the exit together, forming a 'duck chain'. Depending on the number of ducks you liberate and the length of your chain, seconds will be subtracted from your overall time, earning you a medal in the process if you're swift enough.   As a starting point, it all works very well. Unfortunately, the first of Super Rub'a'Dub's many shortcomings is its complete failure to develop the idea in any particular direction. For pretty much the entire duration, you're faced with a range of extraordinarily basic 'mazes' to navigate, with obstacles limited to the odd chasm, badly placed shark or - very occasionally - a strong current or out-of-reach duck bubble. With a bit of creativity, these simple ingredients would be enough to fashion some increasingly fiendish skill-based levels to navigate. Unfortunately, what you get instead is level after tediously bland level, pretty much guaranteeing a flatline on the excite-o-meter after ten minutes. Even on 'Tough' mode, the only challenge arises from basic design flaws and sloppy controls.     Actually, now's probably a good time to address the issue of controls. Let's not forget that Super Rub'a'Dub is, essentially, the first game out of the Sony stable to rely exclusively on the PS3's motion-sensing capabilities. That being the case, you'd expect this to be a flagship title, demonstrating tight, responsive controls as a sign of things to come. Unfortunately, what you get - and yes, we realise this is entirely thanks to the inherent water-based gameplay - is a title which forces you to fight the completely unpredictable water physics in a manner which essentially feels like your duck is roller-skating drunkenly through syrup.    Presumably, in a bid to show off just how damn good the PS3 is at replicating real-life water, the developer failed to stop and think how this would affect the game itself. Consequently, even the simplest straight line manoeuvres require painfully minute adjustments to the SIXAXIS, lest an errant wave sloshes against a wall behind you, ricocheting up your arse and sending your duck and its troop catapulting over the side of the level. Similarly, things are all too unpredictable when it comes to navigating around enemies - one inevitable misstep and half your entourage is either eaten or jettisoned off into solitude. Unfortunately, given that success in a level is entirely dependent on bringing as many ducks to the exit as possible, you've got no choice but to restart after even the tiniest, unsalvageable mishap. It's hugely frustrating - and that's not even factoring in the dubious decision to map the 'jump' function to a jolt of the pad, rather than a button. Yup, unless you're holding the controller completely level, your ducky inevitably hurtles into space, taking your hard-earned flock with it.   With all this in mind, you can imagine we were hoping Super Rub'a'Dub's multiplayer option might be able to save proceedings from complete disaster. With support for up to four people, it's a bit of a disappointment to discover that you're expected simply to take it turns completing a single-player level as quickly as possible. Needless to say, enjoyment is limited to gleeful masochistic delight as your opponents grapple futilely with the controller and shout at the cat.    Admittedly, Super Rub'a'Dub does have some plus points. While simple, the visuals - particularly the water, with its constant shifting and rippling, bubbling and cascading - are nice. The generative soundtrack is subtly impressive too, randomly fading ambient samples in and out to embellish the base tunes. In fact, there's no avoiding that Super Rub'a'Dub feels more like a tech demo with a half-arsed game bolted on top - probably because that's exactly what it is.Ultimately, even for the couple-of-quid asking price, Super Rub'a'Dub is a slightly embarrassing start to Sony's European PlayStation Network original content ambitions. As a game, the whole thing is simply too dull, repetitive and frustrating to be considered fun even by the casual gaming audience it's clearly intended for. What's more, as a demonstration of the SIXAXIS, it's a slightly peculiar choice, given the inherently unresponsive nature of gameplay. With far superior offerings like Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection hitting the PlayStation Network on launch day for a handful of coins more, you'd have to be qua- um, you know the rest.", "date": "Mar 19, 2007"}
