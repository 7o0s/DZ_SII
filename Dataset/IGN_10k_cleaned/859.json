We've seen so many tripped out, psychedelic freak fests and neo-apocalyptic carnivals that only hermits and congressmen are still shocked by the insanity. If it's not giant robots and four-year-old pilots, it's transgender kung fu masters or pornographic mandibles and near-naked schoolgirl superheroes. Forget it, Ted-san. Nothing's shocking.  But JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is pretty weird.  It's not just the graphic design, although that is suitably crack-laced. It's the game itself that is bizarre. With nutty gameplay tangents and jacked-up battle balance, this game is less a fighting game and more a tweaked action game with a concentration on fighting. This twisted mix will probably put off most fight fans. Even though the original arcade mode is intact, the fighting in JoJo is largely uneven and haphazard to control. If you're looking for a true street fighting game, I'd suggest Street Fighter.   JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is for somebody completely different. Maybe you, maybe not, but never has a game divided the line so clearly and told everybody else but JoJo fans to go bite themselves. Anime fanatics might find sweetness in the 2D story sequences, which brings the Japanese comic book alive with animation like a Shockwave movie. JoJo is an exercise in style over substance, and although the two are never too far apart, only those already indoctrinated in JoJology need apply.  Gameplay Battling through the game's story mode here in the office, I was constantly asked the same question: ~Wait, isn't JoJo a fighting game?~ And I'd say yes, and tell them to hang around for a battle sequence to show up. Twenty minutes, an R-Type-type shooter, a game of Royal Poker, a boss battle, and a few tarot cards later, I was finally able to show them that yes, JoJo is a fighting game. You just aren't fighting very often.  It's this type of shifting gameplay that draws the line in the sand for JoJo fans. On one hand, some of the games are very, very good. The shooting game sequence is stellar, with several innovations I'd love to see implemented in the next Darius Twin. On the other hand, there are several sequences with Dragon's Lair-style timed-tap gameplay, only randomized to keep players on their toes. These sequences are extremely frustrating, and even if you get good at the timing and hand-eye coordination, there will be instances that will test your patience and endurance. Since this is a fighting game, it would have been nice if Capcom had focused on action sequences akin to fighting, but the randomness of this game is mostly off-putting. Fortunately, quests can be saved in progress, but players may find that they've lost their rhythm if they drop the controller for a while.  Part of what distances JoJo's Bizarre Adventure from your typical sane game player is the Japanglish translation job done here. None of the characters' voices are dubbed, which is fine for purists but means the rest of us will have to wade through page after page of baloney-jabber. It would have been nice if Capcom had added silly English dubs (you know, when everybody sounds like either Ricardo Montalban or Squiggy from Laverne & Shirley), but it wouldn't have helped a lick with the meandering plot and the boatload of mixed characters. Every time I came into a battle with an enemy and he cried out ~Prepare for yet another whipping from the force of my Stand,~ I half expected my character to say, ~Dude, haven't I fought you before? Aww, I can't even remember anymore.~  What's at the heart of this game is a sticky fighting game that only half appeases Street Fight fans. Most gamers get into fighting games looking for three things: a dude who fights like Ryu, a chick who's as fast as Chun Li, and a big dude who can do cool stuff. After that, everything else and every other character is simply gravy. Unfortunately, while typical Capcom moves are in the game, fight fans will only find vague representations of those necessary characters here. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure comes off more like a early-'90s Data East SF rip-off than a true Capcom fighter -- characters are tall and lanky and the control is a bit stiff. And don't forget that the balance is completely off.  To its credit, however, there are plenty new fighting characters in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, including a scappy puppy and an eagle, that give new dimensions to the gameplay. Also innovative is the Stand system, which you may have to read our  JoJo preview to understand -- I'm still sort of fuzzy on the concept, and I've been playing this game all week long. Basically, it's a ghost that battles as part of your character. The Stand acts somewhat like a permanent VS. tag partner, running out for attacks and teaming up with your character for Super attacks. It can start combos that both fighters can continue, or simply unleash a huge killer move. Technically, with only three attack buttons and limited moves per character, there's not a ton to do in this game, but the Stand does add strategy and depth.  Graphics What's lovable about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is the graphic novel stylings behind the visual design. Outside of the fighting game, and often inside as well, this is the most eclectic game on the system. If you buy this game, pick it up first for the graphics, second for its freaky fighting, and then mull around with it some more just to look at everything. It is a diverse and sharp graphic presentation, with style shifts and animated comic book shows have only been done well in one other instance I can think of (the comic-turned-cartoon The Maxx). This is artistic flexing, pure and simple.  Once you get into battle, the graphics even out a bit more flatly, but there's still buckets full of style, and if you're a devoted Capcom fan it's all for you. The character designs are in Capcom style of cute/ cut / cool, and the characters are always a mix or compliment. The hot chicks have butt-ugly Stand counterparts, the adorable puppy fight ferociously and swiftly in between its adorable ear wag animations, and the heroes have even more hip Stands. Some of the attacks, such as the big mouth that swallows your opponent (then shows him from inside the mouth as he is being gnawed on) are as incredible as they are surreal.  However, those simply looking for a fight without all this gimmicked sideshow antics won't be too happy with this game. It looks very good in motion and in still shots (and the fact that both characters and their Stands can be on screen is a testament to Capcom's 2D mastery, almost making one wonder if SF vs. X-Men might really be doable), it's not exactly conducive to fighting like a true Street Fighter should be. Animation in a fight is stiff and too fast to follow (except, of course, in Super attacks). You lose your timing sometimes because of the animation weaknesses. Characters have a lot of detail and frames of animation, but it's cycled animation with little transition. For instance, a jump kick looks well animated, with the pant legs blowing in the wind from the force, but the actual attack goes from standing to kick, with almost nothing in between. Most attacks use this trick, and while it doesn't look bad, it takes adjustment for those of us used to more precise 2D and even more advanced 3D grapplers. It just doesn't move or feel like Street Fighter, and while the game is fun once you get going, most of us who buy this will do so looking for another SF experience.  Sound Where Capcom really budgeted itself, both in money and PlayStation RAM space, was in the sound. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has all the typical J-Pop music tracks and nonsense character shouts, but they are severely clipped and chirped in this game. The stereo audio and explosive action sounds very lo-fi here, and audiophiles won't like the loss in quality. However, this sacrifice in audio was probably due to memory constraints, particularly with the demanding Stand system. Some may gripe about the lesser sound quality, but it was all for the sake of better gameplay, so let's not harp on it.  What would have been nice, however, is English dialog. The game has thousands of screens of text, and that's a killer in gameplay, particularly in an action game. A fighting game that takes ten minutes before getting to the fight has some priority issues. The story is so garbled that it may not have mattered one way or another whether there was an English dub (most gamers would have simply skipped it and read the text, or just jumped straight ahead to the battles), but I think the game would have been more exciting if gamers weren't constantly brought out of their zone by being asked to read a novel in between battles. You know now if you're a JoJo gamer or not. If you read Anoop's nunya-Japanese import reviews on IGNdreamcast, it may be right for you. If you scan anime chat sites daily, this may be your game. If you loved MTV's The Maxx, JoJo is your kind of guy. And if you're thinking right now that it's either Street Fighter, Tekken, or bust, then I need say nothing more to you.", "date": "Apr 12, 2000"}
