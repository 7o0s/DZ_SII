Sadly, it doesn't seem like they'll have quite enough juice to swing around the leaders and take first place.  Touring Car puts up more than a good fight in a number of areas, but a few blistering flaws keep it from nearing the checkered flag.    Cranking things up, aspiring drivers who sift through the manual and options screens will discover one of TOCA 2's most redeeming traits.  There are several different styles of play available, as well as a good compliment of customization choices for each car in your proverbial garage.  Everything from working the kinks out on the test track, giving the time trials a go, or diving straight into the championship is listed among your options right from the get go, so the necessity to choose one is the only real frustration.  The menu system is quite slick in its design, and allows intuitive access to what could potentially be a fairly complicated set of options.  Also noticed is the impressive musical score in the background, though this is probably due to the fact that it is the only time you will actually hear music in the game (more on that later).  All in all, everything leading up to the actual play experience is well designed, and few racing enthusiasts will find much to complain about here.  Moving into the meat of the title, players will be treated to a rather beautiful set of in-game graphics.  Touring Car takes advantage of modern 3D acceleration hardware (as it kind of has to if it wants to even have a shot out there these days), and thus is loaded with smooth surfaces, slick animation, and little background image pop-up.  Tragically, pretty wrapping paper doesn't make for a nice present.  The control scheme used here is the most frustrating thing I've come across in a long time.  Happily unpacking my force feedback steering wheel and fastening it onto my desk, I expected a truly realistic driving experience to go along with the eye candy.  Unfortunately, the game had some other ideas in mind.  Getting this thing to recognize my wheel was akin to trying to get a toddler to sit still in a photo shoot.  Everything I tried just seemed to cause more problems.  After about a half hour of fiddling around, I finally got some response from the program, but only in digital mode.  If you've never tried driving around in one of your racing titles with a digital wheel, I highly recommend this incredibly comical experience.  Imagine trying to drive your real car with an array of steering options which include:  cut the wheel to the left, go straight, or cut the wheel to the right.  No in-between here campers, you're either going straight or banking your car into the side wall.  Welcome to TOCA 2.  In all fairness, it's possible that I simply lacked the wizardry necessary to get the controls working correctly, and that it wasn't in fact the fault of the game.  So, with that in mind I switched over to the keyboard functions and started up my engine again.  It was at this point that it became clear that the control woes were not entirely of my own doing.  Upon achieving anything close to what might be called a ~speedy pace~ and then attempting a turn (of nearly any degree), the car spun off the track into a flurry of dust clouds and flying grass.  I'm not talking F-15 caliber acceleration here either folks.  A single, short jerk at a speed only slightly above that which is recommended for the turn will send you right into last place.  The most frustrating aspect of this is the fact that the computer controlled cars seem to have no problem negotiating the many twists and turns of these tracks at a velocity significantly above one which you can safely travel.  There's nothing quite as discouraging as rounding a corner in the middle of a pack of other cars, moving at the same speed as they are, and being the only one to end up killing worms on the side of the road.  I did find that using the rear camera and driving backwards seems to offer a startling amount of control at a fairly nice speed, though it certainly wasn't enough to keep up with the road runners who were lapping me by that time.    On another interesting note, keeping your foot off the acceleration pedal (oh, sorry, I mean keeping your finger off the keyboard) and thus killing the sound effects allows you to sample the non-existent in-game sound track.  That's right, you too can sit idle in the dirt 50 feet from the track and listen to absolutely nothing.  It's kind of sad to have a game that looks as good as this one does lacking something as simple as music.  This can of course be solved by picking out one of your favorite CD's and throwing it in the 'ol walkman before the race begins, but it would have been nice if Codemasters would have thought of this little oversight before shipping.  On the lighter side, the sound effects are actually quite convincing, though they don't seem like they would be that hard to emulate.  If you're a gamer who likes to turn the music off anyway, at least you won't have to worry about that this time around.  Ultimately, this title boils down to one immutable truth.  If you've got the patience to sit down, figure out the steering wheel setup for an hour, and spend a fairly extensive amount of time getting used to the ever so sensitive control structure, you may get some enjoyment out of Touring Car Challenge.  However, the fact remains that there are better racers out there, with even more options, and newfangled features such as ~music.~  If you're die hard with the patience of a holy knight, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, leave this one in the dust.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Dec 18, 1999"}
