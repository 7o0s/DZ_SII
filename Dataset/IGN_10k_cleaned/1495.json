And for most arcade ports to the Dreamcast, this has been true, only because of the additional extras that add more replay value.  However, if an arcade is perfectly ported to a console without any additional modes, the replay value of that arcade game is limited.  Such is the only problem with Cannon Spike, a port of the arcade game to the Dreamcast.  Cannon Spike is absolutely fun, with the solid shooting gameplay on level with Metal Slug... it's just too bad there aren't any bonus options. Cannon Spike is best described as a Smash TV-like action game.  As part of the Anti-Robot Special forces, your job is to take back the cities being terrorized by various robotic forces.  In order to maximize your mobility, each character is given high-powered Motor Boots.  Each of the characters has a weak and strong variant of their close and missile attack, as well as having a ~super bomb~ high-damaging attack.  Finally, you have a lock-on system that helps you target specific opponents; by pressing and holding the R Trigger, the character will be able to strafe side to side while still facing the targeted opponent.  Though you can't circle the enemy with the targeting mode on, you definitely need to rely on the lock-on option, because you're going to be facing a whole mess of enemies.  It's been awhile since Dreamcast players have had a solid shooting action fest, where ninja-like reflexes and lighting quick decision making skills are the requirement.  The game builds you up slowly, so for the first initial three or four levels, you will be thinking it's a breeze.  Then, from nowhere, a swarm of enemies will come out of the woodwork.  This is definitely a good example of ~twitch~ gaming.  And despite what you think, you never really get bored with this same blasting action because you really don't have time to be thinking of such things.  The game is also visually solid, though with Capcom at the helm, this shouldn't even be an issue.  It's delightful to have characters from other Capcom games (i.e. Mega Man, Charlie, Cammy, etc.) appear here, and the character models are the quality we come to expect from the Dreamcast.  Great special effects -most notable is flame effect from special attacks.  And should choose to play this game on a Dreamcast VGA box, you're going to be in for a real treat.  So, we've got a thumbs up for the visuals and five star rating on the gameplay... what could go wrong?  Well, as we stated earlier, Cannon Spike came out originally as an arcade game.  And the longevity of an arcade depended on how many quarters you could pump into it.  With the game at home, even though you're limited to three credits, it's only a matter of time before you beat the game within that credit limit.  Though the game sports a Gallery mode, there really isn't a lot to come back for second helpings.  It would've been nice to see even more extra characters or additional modes.  But in the end, Cannon Spike is definitely a great game that, despite lacking longevity, will satisfy those nervous reflex twitches.     --Anthony ~Where's Strider?~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 17, 2000"}
