Building on the success of games like 688(I) and Sub Command, Sonalysts are now offering a more survey-oriented sim in the tradition of Jane's Fleet Command. The new game, Dangerous Waters casts a wide net over the world of contemporary naval operations letting players experience the interplay between a variety of naval assets and familiarize themselves with the operating procedures of each.  One of the biggest draws here is the number and variety of controllable platforms. Like Jane's Fleet Command before it, Dangerous Waters gives you the option to take air, surface and sub assets into battle. The lone surface ship in the game is the Oliver Hazard Perry missile frigate. Though it's not terribly versatile, it's a great sub hunter. The frigate can also launch the controllable MH-60R multi-mission helicopter. Its powerful detection technology and powerful missiles make it a powerful weapon against surface and sub targets alike. You can also fly the P3-C Orion plane for anti-submarine or surveillance missions.  If those vehicles just aren't enough for you, you'll be happy to hear that there are a wealth of subs to choose from. On the US side, you'll be able to take the conn of the ubiquitous SSN 688(I) or the super silent, super stealthy Seawolf SSN 21. On the Russian side you'll get two versions each of the formidable Kilo and Akula subs. The Chinese also get into the action with their own versions of the Kilo class subs.  Though these are the only drivable platforms, there are plenty more to be found in the game. These constitute the things you'll be escorting, tracking or fighting. A very thorough in-game reference gives you all sorts of details about each of the ships, subs and aircraft you'll encounter.  The game comes with a hefty manual. With over 500 pages of information detailing each of the weapon platforms and the interface screens used to control them, the manual is bound to answer just about every question that could possibly come up during play. It doesn't necessarily make great reading, but it's a hell of a resource. To help you get a head start on the game, the developers have also included an hour of video tutorials. Though they'd have been more helpful as fully interactive exercises, the individual tutorials definitely help orient you towards the various interfaces.   Directing each of the weapons platforms and managing their various subsystems constitute the main challenge of the game. Finding targets, identifying them and engaging them is a process that will be repeated often as you play. Since each ship has up to 10 different stations to man, you'll need to get the procedures down.  Determining how you operate is the first big challenge. Knowing just how visible each of your several sensor modes makes you is key to locating your enemies while still preserving the element of surprise. Once you've spotted a contact, you'll have to identify it. Though your sensors can play a big role in telling you what you're seeing, you'll still need to step in and assign IDs to ships yourself. This alerts the crew members at other stations that a particular target is hostile. You can then move to other stations to assign fire orders to that target. It might sound like a tedious process but there's a definite reward in seeing everything come together for a successful encounter.  To help ease the burden, there's a voice command system as well. If you have a microphone, you can actually speak your commands to the game and it will respond. Though it's a nice feature, the keyboard and mouse interface is convenient enough to make it little more than a novelty. More significant are the options to turn over certain stations to the AI. You can select any number of stations to be manned by the game itself and be sure that they'll run effectively.  In addition to the capabilities of the individual crew station AI, the AI for the other ships is quite good as well. Friendly and enemy ships adopt stances appropriate for their situation and seem to know when to hide and when to fight. I was a bit disappointed to see that some of the friendly ships seem somewhat ignorant of you. In convoy missions, for instance, you'll have to be careful not to let the other ships accidentally crash into you. It's happened to me more than once that a friendly ship holds a straight course when presented with an obstacle.  Dangerous Waters comes with a large campaign simulating a split within the Russian navy. A mutiny in the Pacific Fleet puts ballistic missile subs in the hands of Russian rebels. The rest of the Russian navy moves in to hunt them down. Seeing this as a purely internal affair, the Russian government warns the US that any involvement would be considered an act of war. The US fleet heads out anyway and begin to uncover some disturbing information about the rebels and their plans. Using the need to defend themselves in the coming conflict as a pretext, China begins to move in on Taiwan.      The player will have the chance to take up to four sides in this war, switching from the US or Chinese perspectives to those of the Russian navy or the rebels. The campaign unfolds dynamically with your choices and successes having an impact on how the interested parties view each other. There's no way to advance through the campaign without succeeding at each mission's goals, but there's still a lot of variety built into the campaign engine.  If the campaign itself is a little too daunting at first (and it probably will be), you can cut your teeth on a variety of single missions. You can pick from a list of scripted missions or design one yourself using the quick mission builder. The range of missions here is pretty broad but almost every single mission involves finding and identifying something and engaging in combat. If you want a very specific mission that the game doesn't offer, there's a very rich mission editor that you can use to script your own encounters.  Dangerous Waters offers support for up to 30 players but the lack of a matchmaking tool within the game itself means that the number of games available are going to be very limited. Meeting up with an opponent and connecting with their game is left entirely up to you here. Interestingly, the game includes a cooperative feature where multiple players share the same ship, sub or plane, dividing up responsibility for each of the systems. Though it's a neat idea, I just can't imagine ever wanting to jump into a multiplayer game just so I can stare at the Target Motion Analysis screen. Luckily players can reassign duties as they wish.  The graphics in the game are pretty good, especially by the standards of the sim genre. The individual weapons platforms are a bit blocky but they're definitely acceptable given the level at which the game is played. The ship textures are also well done but I would have liked to see more visible damage modeling. There are some cool effects when your ship or plane gets really damaged; watching your patrol plane make a fiery crash into the sea is particularly cool.  The world around you looks good as well. The waves on the ocean are convincing, especially when the ships are rolling along with them. The wake behind each ship is nice but a little static. It also seems to originate from the bow, meaning the wake can clip through your own ship if you turn hard enough. Other visual treats include the sky and cloud model and the dense fog that can sometime lie low on the sea. When you dip below the surface of the sea to spot a sub or torpedo you'll be rewarded with some believable sea floor textures and a neat bubble effect.   The flat panels representing each of the stations you'll have to manage are very believable. All the readouts and buttons are fully functional. Though I haven't spent much time working with the FFG-7 hull sonar station console in real life, I wouldn't be surprised if it looks and functions exactly like the one in the game does.  In terms of sound, Dangerous Waters really doesn't offer much. In addition to the voiced crew dialogue, there's a small bit of music here and there. The voice work is definitely functional but it's a tad flat. While that sort of nonchalance and lack of personality in the voices is entirely authentic, it doesn't add to the drama of the action at all.  Games like this are a hard sell for most people. Many gamers just don't understand the appeal of staring at a blip on a radar screen or of having to solve math problems in order to launch torpedo attacks. They're just missing the point. It's the adherence to the actual procedures at each level that makes these games appealing. Short of actually enlisting, games like Dangerous Waters are as close as many of us can get to knowing the how and why of real world navy operations.Sonalysts Combat Simulations really delivers on this score, authentically recreating the processes of combat, from identification to engagement, in a variety of exciting missions. Though it's very detail-oriented, Dangerous Waters eases the burden of command with a convenient interface and a comprehensive manual. It's still not everybody's cup of tea but fans of the genre will surely love it.", "date": "Feb 28, 2005"}
