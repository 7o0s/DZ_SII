It wasn't a perfect simulation, and it wasn't as tight an arcade game as Moto Racer, but it was big and wild, and the crashes alone were worth the price of admission. Now we've got a sequel with even more tracks, a massive Enduro addition, licensed gear and better crashes than ever, just in time for summer.  For more information about what you can expect in the MM2, check out our recent preview of the game. But to recap, you've got more stunts, a pro-circuit mode that allows you to build up prize money and sponsorship moolah while buying bigger and better bikes, improved graphics, and an Enduro mode which puts you in open environments all over the world.  Except for the Pro-Circuit mode, the game is completely free form in structure. If you're looking for a track-by-track competition on the courses, you won't get it to the extent you'd like in Motocross Madness 2. The game definitely makes up for it with customizability, and once you get your head around the number of options you can tweak, you'll be more than satisfied with the overall experience. Once you get the hang of it, it's easy to set up a race or series of races with other computer riders, pick the number of laps, and the engine limit that you feel comfortable with.   The Baja, Nationals and Supercross races are just as addictive as the original game, but look even better. Nationals are always my favorite, since they tend to have some crazy crossovers, and some very nice looking outdoor scenery, but for those of you that like to work your brakes and accelerators, you'll find that the Supercross track will give you fun and frustration in one neat package. Oh, and in case you were wondering, the Baja course still features the wide open spaces, with the ~cannon shot~ feature for those of you that want to climb the bordering mountains.  Enduro is by far the most interesting new addition to the Motocross Madness universe. You've got open environments ranging from farmlands and ski resorts to desert tracks and south American jungles, each with their own quirks and features. The farmland features a train track with a scheduled train, while you'll see moving cars on the highway of the South American dirt roads. And the environments aren't just dense -- they're massive. They capture the free form feeling of MM2 better than any other mode, and show off exactly why gamers keep coming back to play quick MM games months after they've beaten the levels.  The Pro-Circuit addition is a lot less impressive. While it tries to add a sense of long-term gameplay to Moto-Madness 2, it feels like just that -- an addition. The computer racers are hard enough to make earning cash a frustrating affair, and while it's fun to be part of a long-term career in the game, having to do a whopping six laps of some of the massive Enduro courses will make you feel like you're trying to run a marathon instead of race a bike. Though it's a good idea, the implementation is such that most gamers will want to pop back into the quick play modes for some instant satisfaction.  As for the multiplayer mode, Microsoft has added league, team and ladder competitions to the zone in order to put some big time scoring into your online racing experience. While we didn't have a chance to try out the ranking system for obvious reasons, we did burn up our drives playing this game over LAN. And playing it again. And again. The Tag option has you holding on to a beach ball for as long as possible in order to rack up points -- if another player get near you, it's stolen. Throw in all the Enduro tracks to race on, or on of three special arena tracks, and you have yourself some instant fun. Of course, you're also able to have normal races on any of the tracks, but given that or the option to screw over Steve and Tal, there's really only one choice.  The game itself is very controller friendly, and works well with a keyboard, a mouse, and most surprising of all, a joystick. I found the joystick to be the best option, purely because it gives you a little more control when it comes to cornering, and more importantly, it allows you to feel every crash, engine rev, and whoop-de-doo on the tracks.  The controls are simple, the tricks are a breeze to pull off, and you've got a trailer-full of options -- but where the game truly shines is in the graphics. The first game looked fantastic, but the sequel takes the bar and raises it even higher with high-quality crashes, dense environments, and the smoothest hills you've ever seen in a racing game. They're truly buttery, and since you're going to be spending most of your time racing/jumping/eating them, they're also essential to the game's success. Environments have even more variety with the addition of Enduro tracks that introduce you to trailer park roofs, ski lifts, and the most pain-inducing bales of hay known to man. The Nationals have some eerie realism, and Supercross tracks have the sights and sound of the real thing, only if the crowds actually felt bad for you if you slid on your face for 50 feet.   Speaking of sound, the games keep the music out of the actual races, and focus on the sounds of the bikes themselves. The high-pitch squealing is authentically replicated, but thankfully put through an ~annoying non-stop screech kill~ filter to ensure that you'll actually enjoy hearing your bikes go through their motions. Supercross crowd sounds are incredible and dynamic, and the Enduro environments have nice details in relation to your environments.  Still, I wish that a game that looks and sounds this real felt the same. Though it's fun as hell to race, you'll find that the bikes turn with a snap around corners with little or no friction, or slide out as if on ice -- but you never get the kick of finally gripping the dirt, or the gratification that comes from using the terrain to your advantage. Racing on icy roads may be different than sand in terms of gameplay, but they're much less than you'd expect when it comes down to actual button-mashing. The game keeps you in check when it comes to hills though, and you'll rarely make a shoddy jump if you don't land just right. The controls are favorable for gamepads and keyboards, basically, but if you use an analog control setup (like I did with a SideWinder), you'll wish you had more control over the subtleties of bike wrangling.  In the end though, it's about fun, and MM2 provides this in piles and piles. The crash animations never (and I mean never) stop being anything less than hilarious, and the action is always as a pretty relentless pace. The eye-candy is constantly impressive, the physics are crazy enough to be fun but real enough to look right, and the multiplayer game is a blast, especially if you've got devious friends. Though I wish there was more technique involved in wrangling the bikes, it's a far cry from saying that it detracts from the overall gameplay.   Motocross Madness 2 is a worthy successor to the original, and with the dearth of dirt bike racing games on the market, it's great to see such a fleshed out, polished racer hit the PC. It definitely dances the dangerous line between arcade and sim, but if you like big heights, fast corners and horrific crashes (and who doesn't?) then you'll be happy you gave this one a drive.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "May 27, 2000"}
