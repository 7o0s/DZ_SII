Imagine all the football fans out there that would love to play football on the go. On my way to the Raider game on Sunday, I was stuck in miles of traffic. But lucky for me, I wasn't driving. I had my early copy of Madden going on PSP and the time flew by. I played Sunday's game right there in the car on the way to the real thing. Honestly, there's no better way to prepare to watch a football game than to play-out the match-up before you watch it live.   With that in mind, no football game can cater to the hearts and minds of rabid football fans like Madden 06 on PSP. I'll even go out on a limb and say that having Madden on a handheld is better than having it on consoles just  because you can take it with you to a real game just like I did. If I wanted to, I could've played some during halftime just to feed my craving. If there's any game I'd want to have on the road with me at all times, it's Madden.  Now although this is Madden we're talking about, the game has taken some dings in it's iteration on PSP. These few things aren't overwhelming enough to spoil the gaming experience, but they do tarnish it a bit. Also, because this is the PSP version, some compromises had to be made in terms of scale. There aren't as many features here as the console version. But the team did put in some PSP exclusive goodies to flesh out the experience, and make the game worth our time for the on-the-go experience.  Madden 06 on consoles introduced both the vision cone and precision passing. Personally, I wasn't too fond of the vision cone because it made passing a bit more complicated than usual. The feature doesn't make its way into Madden 06 for PSP, but precision passing does. Just in case you're not familiar with precision passing, it allows the quarterback to place the ball in more specific places for the receiver to catch. How does this work? Say your receiver is covered by a shorter cornerback. You can exploit the difference in their height by placing the ball a little high when you pass it. All of this is controlled by the analog nub or D-pad, whatever suits you best. One of the mini-games is devoted to refining this very skill, so you'll have plenty of opportunity to master this feature if it sounds a little tough to pull off. The vision cone would've just added a layer of frustration. Imagine trying to read the field under pressure, while swinging a cone around to get in a good pass. Now imagine how difficult all that would be on a small screen like the PSP, and it becomes clear as to why saving precision passing and dumping the vision cone was a nice move.     One of the most important questions that everyone has been asking about is ~how does the game actually look on PSP.~ We all know the PSP has a nice screen and all, but knowing that the dev team is shrinking down a game that requires you to make snap decision based on where players run in chaotic situations would give almost anyone doubts about the finished product. Well thankfully, the graphics here are pretty crisp. Things are clear enough for players to read positioning and proximity, and even find opportune holes for a devastating running play. The animations are rather impressive as well. The players have a healthy dose personality, with a nice selection of celebrations for touchdowns, penetrating sacks, and all the other mainstays like falling and tackling. All the specific emotions still read even though they're so small.   The AI here is pretty sharp, and true to life. When I played against the eagles, I broke them down slowly by pressuring McNabb relentlessly. After a while, he began to buckle under the pressure, and started getting inaccurate with his passes. Teams do become aware of your money plays, and the defense will adapt to break up your rhythm. There's a good amount of depth here, enough to challenge the way you approach each play.    There are 10 all new mini-games exclusive to the PSP, and they're just as addicting as they were on the consoles. In all, you have 18 total. The one I spent the most time with was the one for precision passing. You're basically playing the role of QB, and you have three receivers running routes. There are hoops placed in specific locations along the receiver's route that you're supposed to try and hit with your pass. They're each graduated in difficulty, bronze being the easiest, and gold being the hardest. The idea is to get better control of your pass using the precision passing control, which the hoops force you to do when you're aiming at them. But you're also trying to get the receiver to catch the ball, so you really have to focus. It's all great fun and practice rolled into one. It makes sense for the dev team to load the PSP Madden with mini-games because they suit handheld gaming very well. They could've very well packaged these mini-game scenarios under another title and they would probably sell really well to PSP gamers. For the PSP Madden, there are exclusive mini-games like, Passing Distance, Kicking Distance, 40 yard dash, Kick Return, and Route Running.   Probably one of the hottest accomplishments for this particular title is the PSP and PS2 connectivity with Madden 06. You can actually start a franchise game on your PSP or PS2, upload it to the EA locker (an info hub on the web for all EA sports games), and download it to either device. You can download your rosters or profile, and take your game on the road with you. This is ideal for the situation I spoke about in the top of this review. If I had season tickets for all the Raider games, I could play out the each game on my way to the real game while I wait in traffic.  It's just great. The time flies by while I get familiar with the team plays, and ready to watch it all in person. Another bonus is the online play that the dev team took advantage here. You can play other Madden owners all over the country on their PSP. You get the game rankings and EA messenger features from the console as well.   There are two key features in the franchise mode that are rather cool here. With the Assistant Coach mode, users are given 4 goals to meet for a week of play. Each week you get new goals. This could mean reaching a certain number of rushing yards, passing yards, or sacks. For every goal that is met, a point is awarded. These points are used to improve player attributes, which of course gets a better performance out of your team. Practice Squad allows you to sign eight players for the bench, just like real football. The idea is to build up there attributes through drills (more on that later). Once they're up to par, you can sign them on to the real team, or release them, whatever you want. You can actually use points earned through the Assistant coach mode on the players here. But the thing is, you get more points for accomplishing task in drills. You'll get anywhere from 2 to 3 points for drills, and just 1 point for goals met through assistant coaching. So again, you're getting a nice amount of depth with your handheld experience.  The flaws that show up in Madden 06 on PSP are easy to ignore in the beginning. That first initial load screen comes up and it just chugs. When you hop into a quick game, and you select past a few menu screens, you run into more chugging. All of sudden, that quick pick-up and play nature I'm looking for gets a bit hazy. Once you finally make it into the game (after more chugging with more loading), you haven't quite escaped the chugging. With every a play, every transition, from screen to screen, there's a pauses or stutters.     When you're warming up and playing the game for the first time, it's not a noticeable because you're thinking about strategy and you don't mind the time the game spends chugging. But when you find your rhythm, and the plays you like, and you know what you want to do with your team, all the pauses and stutters just drag on the experience. Some pauses are longer than others, so much so, that you think the game might have crashed, but it's really just loading the next screen. Maybe if screen transitions were the only pauses to worry about, the flaw wouldn't be as noticeable. But you'll find these issues in game as well. It'll happen a split second before a reception, or right before a tackle. At the very moment a play is complete and the announcer is about to speak, there's a pause that brings everything to a halt. One of the most heavily lauded features of Madden has always been the speed and fluidity of everything. That magical flow that gets things clicking for me when I'm playing is interrupted by the constant pausing through-out the game on PSP.  Madden 06 on PSP is a solid game. It's definitely Madden in the palm of your hands, and the PSP to PS2 connectivity pronounces that fact even better. It has the look, sound and feel of the console versions, and for that I'm grateful. Everything from the online play to the depth here makes this a great addition to PSP libraries everywhere. I just wish things could've been tuned better so that loading was faster. Madden is known as a fast and fluid brand of football games, and it's necessary to have that quality when you got some momentum in a football game. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it is a scratch on what would otherwise be a gleaming finish.", "date": "Sep 19, 2005"}
