Lost in a maze of undersea tunnels and alien command centers, it was up to players to help the young porpoise find and rescue the rest of his pod  a dark and difficult journey. But for the series' third installment, Ecco Jr., SEGA decided to go in an entirely different direction. The dreary storyline was gone, the challenge was entirely removed, and the whole experience was retooled for young children. It was a choice that made the marine exploration design more accessible, but at the cost of any lasting appeal. Ecco Jr. is, sadly, a shallow follow-up to the two far deeper adventures that came before.   Everything looks fine on the surface. You've got the young Ecco the Dolphin, back again, and reimagined to be a bit younger of a dolphin than he previously was. You've got two new playable characters, as well  Kitnee, a darker-colored dolphin, and Tara, who's a young killer whale. And you've got a workable story, as the three friends have decided to set out on an adventure to find the Big Blue, the largest creature living in the sea.   But it's just under the surface level that things start to get choppy, as after selecting which of three marine mammals you'd prefer to control you're taken straight into your first challenge  a scavenger hunt. You're asked to swim around a stage and locate a couple of different sea creatures, then ~sing~ at them with your sonar waves. The task takes only a minute or two to accomplish, especially since the game assists you in tracking down the animals by pointing you in their direction with other waves of sound.   New playable characters, like Tara the Orca, join new undersea activities, like hunting for treasure.  After that, it's more scavenger hunts  as succeeding levels either repeat the same task as the first stage, or else slightly vary the premise by asking you to locate a seal's lost rubber ball, or a set of hula hoop rings, or some pieces of sunken treasure. These activities, to be fair, are all new to the Ecco series and therefore at least a bit novel. The problem is that there's no sense of danger or urgency, at all.   Because all of the enemies have been removed. There's no health meter any more, so you can't die from damage. And you're given an unlimited amount of time to spend underwater. There's no air meter any more, so you can't die from drowning. You can't die from anything, any more, which takes away a whole lot of Ecco's potential to hold your interest. It's unengaging now.   And being unengaging combines with being short, as the low level of challenge and repetitive nature of the game's missions makes it possible to swim through all of Ecco Jr. in only a very short amount of time. It likely wouldn't even take you an hour the first time through, even if you'd never played it before.This kinder, gentler edition of Ecco the Dolphin's adventures is certainly more accessible in the early going. It's easier to get into compared to its predecessors, which might have been too challenging and intimidated players in the past. But beyond the initial ease of adjustment to the design, Ecco Jr. proves to offer little more  its lack of any sense of danger or urgency keeps it from being as engaging as the first Ecco game, or The Tides of Time, and it would be very hard to justify spending 800 Wii Points on this title over those two superior games. Ecco Jr. might still hold some appeal for younger players, who would benefit from the very same features that hardcore gamers would find to be at fault, so it could be considerable for you if you're a fan of the franchise and you have a young son, daughter, niece or nephew you'd like to introduce to Ecco's world. But beyond that possibility, stay well away from these shallow waters.", "date": "Dec 15, 2007"}
