This hex-based title brings a few enjoyable elements to the table but is ultimately riddled with gameplay issues and thematic problems that rob XF of higher praise.   XF follows the story of Clarissa Arwin and Felius Arwin as they attempt to reclaim Clarissa's mother's sword from a troublesome Drifter named Rupert. Their humble quest obviously expands into a much greater story involving an entire kingdom and political upset. Clarissa comes across a number of different characters during her journey and a text heavy plot plays out as the game progresses.    The game is structured in a straight-forward manner and will be recognizable to fans of RPGs. Story sequences move the narrative forward and are punctuated by traveling and battles. You move across a 2D world map with small dots representing both towns and battlefields. While you can enter towns to talk with villagers, buy supplies and hire Drifters to work for you (though only through a list of options -- towns aren't rendered in any way, they're just static images), most of the action happens on the battlefield.   Everything in XF is dictated by precise hex movements and turn-based actions, just like Final Fantasy Tactics. After placing your party on the 3D map, each character has a turn to move and execute commands and the process repeats until particular objectives are fulfilled (or you lose). Battle is also heavily influenced by character classes, which range from magic users, close-range warriors and specialized classes with specific purposes, like dealing with the undead. Unfortunately, most of XF's problems come from the battle system, but we'll get to that in a moment.   Felius to the rescue. As I mentioned above, XF has a number of positive elements to consider. The first thing that comes to mind, surprisingly, is the sound. The Western-themed soundtrack is extremely enjoyable, though it may grow repetitious to some due to the small number of tracks versus the game's total play time, which is extensive. Regardless, the title's voice-over options are admirable, giving users the option of selecting either the original Japanese language track or the English dub. I opted for the Japanese track and was greatly satisfied with the quality of the voice work. The English track sounded... regrettable.   I was also rather impressed with the game's writing. While I can't necessarily speak on the quality of the translation, I will say that the dialogue was decidedly sharp and clever, which is definitely a plus for such a text-heavy title. Some of the characters have some genuinely great personality quirks, Labyrinthia being my personal favorite. But that's not to say the overall story is great -- I wasn't particularly enthralled by the narrative and it seemed pretty standard.   So now: the real problems.   A startling number of the battles in XF are objective-based and require very specific, very unforgiving methods of approach. This issue is easily my greatest problem with the game as a whole, because battles became a matter of extreme trial-and-error. If you don't have the exact classes for the task at hand, you'll usually fail and that means a lot of wasted time. The immense joy of strategy RPGs for me comes from delving into each and every class and exploring how best to use them, outfitting your party with the right members to provide the maximum reward. But XF essentially demands that you approach things a certain way, making a typically creative gameplay type into a linear one.     And while the game attempts to give you control by allowing your characters to switch class at any time (assuming you're not currently in a battle), the resulting gameplay just feels aggravating. When I originally played Final Fantasy Tactics, I would switch classes from time to time, but a great deal of fun came from mastering a class and relying on that one character for very specific purposes. But in XF you have to switch most of your classes for every battle and it makes the game feel like class has no permanence or weight.   More troubling is the fact that some of the objective-based battles are infuriating. For example, an early battle in the game gives you six characters to defend an entire row of hexes from enemy penetration. If a single opponent steps on that side of the map, you instantly lose. Worse still is that every member of the opposing side belongs to a class with nearly unlimited movement range, and they have a force twice as large as your own. I wasted hours trying to best this battle, where a single mistake would let one guy through and ruin your previous twenty minutes of play time. It was absurd.    The problems don't end there. As I mentioned in previous coverage of the game, each of your characters has a VP, or Vitality Points gauge that drops as you perform actions (even waiting). A number of battles require the traversal of a large amount of terrain, and even if you have light armor equipped and possess a VP regenerating skill, your characters will still deplete their gauges before the battle ends. This might not sound so awful, but when the gauge empties, your health begins to drop which subsequently cripples your party.   My final complaints, while not gameplay related, are still pressing. First: XF just doesn't feel like a Wild ARMs game. That Western style presentation the first titles in the series possessed gave them their charm, and XF lacks that. The game's character designs and plot feel nothing like the dusty, pistol-wielding numbers they should be. Second: there is a severe lack of animated cutscenes. The Wild ARMs games have always had beautiful anime clips that breathe some life into the experience, but only still pictures show up in XF, which is really disappointing.   Yes,  Wild ARMs XF definitely does a few things well and can occasionally be fun, but the gameplay just has too many holes to be enjoyable. The objective-based battles aren't particularly well designed and character class implementation takes away a lot of player freedom. If you're interested in a strategy RPG for the PSP, I would look elsewhere -- both Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions and Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness are far superior experiences.", "date": "Mar 14, 2008"}
