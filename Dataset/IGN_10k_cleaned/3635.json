On cellphones, at least.  Console gamers seems to have sadly forsaken the great staple, but on a first-gen 3G celly, the simple shooter could potentially thrive.  SEGA Mobile is giving the genre a go with Space Gunner, a licensed blaster from Coastal Sports.  Does it help or hinder the cause? Features: Multiple levels High score board  You are an intergalactic bounty hunter with bills to pay.  Good thing the cosmos is full of unsavory characters just begging for a little justice.  And that's it.  But really, that's all the back story you need for a blaster.  All that really counts in this genre is if the action is fast, furious, and--most of all--fun.  Unfortunately, Space Gunner is none of these three.  In fact, the only thing that's gonna be furious is you if you spend your hard-earned scratch to download this flawed trifle.  For one thing, earning that alimony payment is made easy by decidedly dumbed-down bad guys that felt the need to paint their ships red.  So, right there, any strategy is jettisoned into the cold regions of space.  All you do is zip from right to left at the bottom of the screen and blast enemies, no matter what shade they are, but just no that the crimson-hued vessels are the ones worth the serious green.  Too bad Coastal Dreams didn't make it so you have to avoid firing on any ship that isn't red, just to make this a shooter with a little bit of brains.  Of course, that would have required decent control to pull off, something Space Gunner is seriously lacking.  Oh, they'll hear you scream in space--screaming at this dumb little game as you are repeatedly unable to line up a decent shot because the designated fire button is on the touchpad.  You have to press ~OK~ to fire your supercannon, and on most phones, the ~OK~ button is activated by pressing the joystick or touchpad in.  To fire your regular gun, you have to press up.  And since these phones are purposefully designed to be small, you almost always end up moving the ship when you intend to fire either gun.  But you know what isn't small?  Your ship.  You're piloting one immense hunk of metal that stretches across a third of the screen.  You might as well have a target painted on your hood, as that's all you are.  Repeatedly, you are pelted with enemy fire you are unable to avoid because of the one-to combo of crap control and an unreasonably sized spaceship.  Visually, Space Gunner looks like it was put together in a weekend.  There are very few enemy types to fire at.  Green globes, blue circle-like ships, reddish circle-like ships, etc.  At least there's some semblance of a starfield in the background.  And space is a quiet place indeed, as the only sounds you hear are the occasionally blast of your cannon or the ~bonk~ of an enemy ship exploding. Well, needless to say, Treasure needn't be looking over their shoulder any time soon.  Space Gunner is as rudimentary as you can imagine--this is kindergarten stuff compared to Ikaruga's maddening shooter.  Of course, it doesn't help that not only is the game design purely ~eh,~ but also that the control is slow and cumbersome.  I haven't been this frustrated since my senior prom.  Blaster fans are better off seeking out the infinitely better Gundam: Space Assault.", "date": "May 5, 2003"}
