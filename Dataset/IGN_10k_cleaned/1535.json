Mooooo! Yes, that's the sound coming out of 3DO's offices these days as they milk that poor Heroes of Might and Magic cow yet again with the second Heroes Chronicles, Conquest of the Underworld. If you didn't like the Heroes of Might and Magic series, you can stop reading right now. There's nothing really new about these Chronicles games. If you're a fan of the Heroes series these Chronicles are mildly enjoyable, sort of like the pleasure you get from watching sitcom reruns that you've seen several times already.   Conquest of the Underworld is the second of four of these short, one campaign Heroes games. This games use the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 turn-based strategy game as their basis and consist of eight linked scenarios that make up a story driven campaign. In Conquest you play as Tarnum, a now dead barbarian king who has returned as a knight. He's been summoned back by a queen who asks him to descend into the underworld so that he can rescue the soul of the queen's deceased father who was kidnapped from heaven. Adding to the dramatic tension (in theory) is the testy little fact that Tarnum was slain by a man whose soul he's being asked to rescue. Shakespeare it ain't, but it's interesting enough to make you want to get to the next scenario to read a bit more of the story.   Like the first Chronicle, Underworld is a bit easier than Heroes 3. 3DO and developer New World Computing are hoping that these Chronicles can serve as entry-level games to entice new players to try the Heroes series. In that regard they're not a bad idea, especially if you can find them priced on sale for $15  they have a $19.95 MSRP. They don't include multiplayer options, extra scenarios, a scenario editor, and random scenarios as does Heroes 3, however. So a far better deal is to buy the latest Heroes 3 repackaging. For $29.95 you can grab the newly released Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete which contains the original game: Restoration of Erathia, the expansion pack: Armageddon's Blade and the stand-alone/expansion: The Shadow of Death. There's probably between 100 and 200 hours of gameplay here, along with an editor for making your own scenarios, a random map generator, and multiplayer options.   Underworld does do some things right, though. Tarnum's experience level gains and items carry over from scenario to scenario, and you can take two of his best heroes along to the next scenario also. Tarnum can also find the six parts of a powerful artifact to assemble it, which will make things a bit easier for Tarnum. The scenarios are well designed and interesting too.   So what's the tacit recommendation of this review? Is this a worthwhile purchase? If you're a big fan of the series and don't mind paying $15-20 for eight new scenarios, it's a good buy. You get fun, well-designed scenarios that hang together well due to the mildly interesting story. The real irony is that if you've never touched the Heroes series, 3DO is hoping that you'll try these Chronicles, yet a far better deal is to buy the latest version of the complete game. It would be a bit easier to be enthusiastic about these Chronicles if 3DO had included a bit more value, like a handful of standalone scenarios. My recommendation for new players is to download the Heroes 3 demo, try it, and if you like it, get Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete and bypass these Chronicles for now. Given 3DO's proclivity for yanking the udders of this series, you can bet that at some point next year all four Chronicles will be packaged together at a reduced price. If you listen closely, you can hear that cow mooing.   -- Mark Asher      Want to share your opinions with the world?
