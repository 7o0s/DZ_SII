Next up -- Radio Control Racers, another member of Sierra Attractions 3D Ultra line, a RC action racer demanding that you give it a little consideration while you search for that last remaining copy of Teen Digital Diva II.  What Sierra has really done is create a low-budget version of Super Sprint that allows you to try out RC racing on cleanly rendered tracks, everything from a mini-golf course, to a haunted mansion. Whether you're veering around a hillbilly course dodging moonshine, or just trying to keep a nasty turtle from taking a bite out of you at the local pond, the levels are all a matter of slamming through jumps, tunnels, and straightaways to guarantee you the one spot. The tracks load up with the entire race on the screen, similar to Super Sprint, but actually zoom in fairly close to give you more detail. Though it means that you can check out just how nasty those dancing gnomes are in the backyard track, it also means that you're much more likely to get confused about what curve is coming up next. Anyone who's played games like RC Pro-Am or Micro Machines will be instantly familiar with the gameplay style -- punch and go. You've got your steering, your gas, and your special power-up button. This is RC racing buddy, so you'll never need to worry about the non-existent brake pedal.   With only eight tracks to take on, you won't have to spend much time exhausting the possibilities of this game. There's a circuit mode that allows you to take on a series of tracks, each of which wins you money and the ability to upgrade your car, but frankly, with only eight tracks to race, you aren't going to have much of an urge to keep pushing for the gold, no matter how much they shuffle the track order. The quick race mode is much better suited for the game, getting you in and out of races quickly, and painlessly. This is arcade style gaming at its very simplest -- grab your car, get on the road, and go. Steer with the keyboard, hold down the gas, and make sure to fire every and all weapons at everything that crosses your path. As far as handling goes, the cars are fairly sticky and rarely slide out of control, so even the clumsiest of hands on the cruddiest of keyboards should be able to conquer most of the races in the game.  There are four cars to choose from: Monster Truck, Stadium Truck, Baja Bug, and Buggy, ranging from the super light buggy to the meaty handling of the monster truck. You'll have your choice of six different looks for your car, which are truly unique when rendered in the selection screen, but translate to ~fly on a screen~ detail when you actually see your car in the game. You'll be able to collect six special weapons on the tracks in order to help you get a one-up on your opponents, everything from a standard Turbo Boost to Electro Shock, a trick lifted straight from Re-Volt that allows you to power-down other cars that come near you for a limited time. Though they are all pretty useful, the animations that accompany the weapons are dismal in appearance, especially considering with the size of the cars, and how little work it would have taken to make them at least a little more exciting. You'll be bored of the controls and the weapons long after you've bored of the nice look and feel of the tracks, unfortunately. Though the animations of the cars are pretty accurate in relation to the environment (especially considering that the backgrounds are pre-rendered), there just isn't a high skill level when it comes to taking corners. You won't be sliding around curves like in RC Pro-Am, and you don't get any of the smooth over-steering that made Super Sprint so much fun. And you can forget about the variety and insanity of Micro Machines. Instead, you'll be left with something that's more exciting than slot cars, but much less interesting than shooting your hot wheels over the barbecue pit with your slingshot. The two player mode adds some fun to the mix, but doesn't back away far enough to really give you enough breathing room with which to play, which means even more wall-slamming than in the one player mode. Still, it's a nice option to include, especially in the budget world where the gamer may not have the online access that most multiplayer games demand.  And there you have it. If you think that I haven't described the details of the game enough, it's because there aren't any. The most complex this game gets is when it allows you to upgrade your car, and even that is fairly useless in practice. If the game had three to four times the amount of levels, it might have been a nice attempt to bring arcade perspective racing to the PC, but Radio Control Racers just doesn't put forth the effort. They didn't even include the option to play zoomed out, which was sad, especially when they tease you with the view in the loading screen. The game reeks of simplicity, which is a shame, because with some added depth this could have been a plug-and-play game for all types of gamers.  I would like to feel some sort of emotion about this game -- even anger, but it really just left me stranded in the country of El Generico. The bus to Hateville was nowhere in site, and the train to Glee was at least a few more hours away, and me, I was just stuck playing RC Racers trying to think of where I was going to head to next. This is a perfect gift for radio control freaks that must own every piece of RC memorabilia, but for those of us that have had a taste of games like Powerslide, or Acclaim's wicked Re-Volt  (or even Nintendo's RC Pro-Am), the limited appeal of Radio Control Racers won't get you excited.  I was debating about what rating to give this game -- it's definitely not wretched, but it's certainly not better than some shareware games I've seen floating around the web. That's when I got a little piece of wisdom from the guy who scrapes out the back of the toilet after work in order to create sculptures from the rotted lint and mildew that collects there -- no, not the intern. He said, ~you need to think to yourself, is this better than playing Ultima IX?~ A good point, actually. Then he told me to get off the toilet so he could scrape better. I'd have to say that this is right around Ultima IX in joy factor, though to be honest, it's a lot less frustrating. This is standard budget fare, which means that if you'd rather not just spend a little more money to get a lot more game, than you can expect exactly what you pay for -- cheap eats.  -- IGN Staff", "date": "Dec 22, 1999"}
