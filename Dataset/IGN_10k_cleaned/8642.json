Gameloft's Driver: L.A. Undercover gives you this distinct impression as a Grand Theft Auto wannabe occasionally veers off-track in a series of mediocre action sequences.   The latest installment of the console-cum-mobile series sends uber-macho rogue Tanner undercover in -- you guessed it -- the City of Angels, charged with bringing down the Los Angeles Mafia.  A former racecar driver who now works with the police, Ryan Reynolds look-alike Tanner is an old-school Don Johnson/Mel Gibson cop, the sort who leaves his razor untouched but never forgets his pistol.   The game gives you 80+ different missions in a combination of foot chase action and high-speed car racing. Like the GTA games and their many, many, many copies, you are able to move about the entire city at will, although there is a handy map provided for checkpoints when you're feeling a bit directionless.  Naturally, there's a garage for repairs, upgrades, and fresh nitro boosts.   Since no mobile phone yet comes with a steering wheel, your left to lots of left and right tapping.  Steering the car with the D-pad/stick was a little clunky, but that could be chalked up to the Sony Ericsson K800 I was using for a test phone. (It has a very tiny joystick.)  I found it much easier to use the 4 and 6 keys.  The 0 button will perform a U-turn, which is fun the first couple of times.  So is the nitro boost you get from the 2 key for a short blast of extra speed.   When you're on foot, a red H.U.D. will appear and lock quickly onto your target for easy, effective shooting (press 5 to pull the trigger).  For an undercover cop, Tanner gets into an awful lot of trouble with his brothers and sisters in law enforcement.  No problem: you can always zip down to the police station and pay off your debts or bribe your fellow cops after you've engaged them in a breakneck chase through the heart of the city.   Driver: L.A. Undercover has plenty of fun ingredients, and is enjoyable in doses.  The problem is, the various game elements don't mesh well.  The foot chases are the weakest aspect, as the clunky mechanics fail to engage and quickly lead to frustration.   The car chases are certainly the highlight -- but these, too, are undone by being too repetitive. Mission objectives include riding around marked areas and destroying everything, running through the street and shooting everything to wreck neighborhoods, and, of course, chasing bad guys and avoiding capture while being chased in return.  Nothing overly complex, simple enough to keep you engaged -- at times, in fact, a little too simple. Anyone with an expansive attention span will soon grow bored of the repetition and tedium of Driver: L.A. Undercover.  Played in short bursts, however, it's likely to provide a quick fix for speed junkies and fans of fast-moving action games.   Gameloft's Driver mixes 2D sprites with 3D environments, giving it a strange hybrid appearance. When you throw the wheel to take a hard turn, your 2D car clicks through a few static views as it negotiates the corner. The cityscapes in the background, also in 2D, are pretty accurate views of the LA skyline. The game is accompanied by some decent, if not unspectacular, music.  This sometimes flaccid GTA clone for your mobile phone tries to be too many things without getting any one element completely right.  It's fun in small doses, but quickly grows tedious.  If you don't have a lot of patience for clunky gameplay, you may just want to leave it in park.", "date": "Jun 18, 2007"}
