EA Sports has divvied up the latest game in its wildly successful series, Triple Play 2001. 3DO is offering its console version of its critically acclaimed High Heat PC series, Sammy Sosa's High Heat Baseball 2001. And finally, 989 Sports is back again (for the last time as its own company) with the latest game in its popular series, MLB 2001.   Gameplay This year's version of MLB 2001 isn't a revolutionary step beyond 989's previous offering, but it does offer some minor improvements to the already polished game. Feature-wise, there isn't another baseball game on the PlayStation that is as stuffed to the brim as this.   MLB 2001 has all of the typical play modes and management features that are a MUST in any baseball videogame, such as Quick Start, Exhibition, Playoffs, World Series, All-Star , Home Run Derby, Season Mode, and the ability to trade and create players. The modes that the game offers that aren't quite standard in baseball videogames (yet) are its Manager, Spring Training, and Franchise modes.   The Manger mode is meant for the hardcore stat junkies, as the player isn't required to ~play~ the game, but just manage the team. However, it actually fails to impress because it doesn't allow the player to completely manage the players in the game, i.e. calling for bunts, hit and runs and the positioning of fielders.   The Spring Training mode is an especially cool mode when you combine it with the ~create a player~ option. The reason being that Spring Training offers you a chance to improve further your characteristics of the created players beyond its default settings (you can't max out your player attributes when creating players, you have to earn points through playing and performing well in Spring Training and the regular season).   MLB 2001's pitching and batting interfaces seem pretty much unchanged from last year's efforts. When pitching, players first select the pitch type and then the location (the time given to setting the location is limited to the pitcher's windup in the single player game). The type of pitch, the control attributes of the pitcher and other factors help determine the accuracy of the ball hitting the intended location. It's nice, easy, and very effective.   The hitting mechanics are equally intuitive. Players can select whether they wish to hit for contact or power (changing the size of the cursor) and then they can move around the cursor to where they wish the player to swing. Once again, it's nice, easy, and very effective.   However, the game is far from perfect as it is plagued with a lot of little problems that keep it from being a top quality game. Firstly, the game doesn't factor in fatigue over the course of an entire season. This won't be a big problem for most people, but for those gamers looking for a realistic representation of the national pastime, it takes away from the value of the game. Basically, there's no need to effectively manage your pitching rotation or your bullpen.   Furthermore, there are some serious issues with the game's AI and realism. The CPU fielders will almost always try and throw out the lead runner, even if there's no chance to get him out. It's possible to throw runners out at first when balls are hit to the right fielder on a regular basis (it'll happen in real baseball, but it's extremely rare). And more often than not, pitching against the computer usually equates to a battle of striking out the CPU or giving up a home run. Racking up 15+ strikeout totals is a common occurrence.    Graphics If you've seen MLB 2000, then you pretty much know what to expect with MLB 2001. Aside from some very minor graphical enhancements, the graphics of MLB 2001 are a direct duplicate of last year's game. The game's player models are slightly more detailed than they were last year, which means that they have the same slightly off look. Basically, the players all seem a bit out of proportion, making all of the players look a bit pudgier than they should.   The player's are animated well, but the animation isn't quite up to the quality that's found in EA Sports' Triple Play 2001. However, the tradeoff of less animation is more than made up for with the game's fast framerate. While there are some points where the game has slowdown, it's still leaps and bounds ahead of TP 2001 in this important facet.   Both hitters and pitchers feature varied stances and motions. 989 Sports has motion-captured some new players to add to its already large stable of player styles. In most cases, the players will hit and pitch in a fashion that resembles their real life counterparts.   The game's stadiums are modeled after the real MLB ballparks and are fairly accurate representations. Even several Spring Training ballparks can be found in the game. However, because of the camera angles of the game, which are generally close to the action or pointing down towards the field, there's never really a time in the game where you get a good view of the stadiums. A minor problem, but some of the current major league ballparks are works of art and it'd be nice to be able to see them as so in the game.   Sound Audibly, MLB 2001 is a pretty much a mixed bag, doing some things better than EA's offering, while being inferior in other areas. On the plus side, MLB 2001 features some quality play by play announcing by Vin Scully and ESPN's Dave Campbell. While there are some problems with Campbell's comments being a bit off from what just happened in the game, and many of the catch phrases seem to be reused from last year's version of the game, it's a quality effort on the whole.   Another point in MLB 2001's favor is the game's excellence use of musical pieces from popular tunes such as Aretha Franklin's ~Respect~ and this one rockin' tune from Van Halen, which generally play at fitting points during the game. The music does an excellent job of increasing the excitement at certain key points in the game, such as when the bases are loaded, and helps the game's overall presentation.   Other in game sounds, such as the various cracks of the bat when contact is made with the ball are extremely well done. There are distinct differences between the sound of a well hit or poorly hit ball off the bat and it helps greatly in bringing the game to life.   On the downer, aside from the excellent timing of the boos, cheers and other crowd effects, the overall enthusiasm of the crowd in MLB 2001 isn't quite up to snuff when compared to TP2001. On the whole, the crowd reactions in EA's game seemed to give off a greater sense of excitement.  In the end, I have to give the edge in this year's Triple Play versus MLB match up to 989's offering, MLB 2001. The game has a better framerate, the difficult levels are more balanced, and the game's features are more robust. However, both games have their advantages and disadvantages and if you happened to prefer last year's Triple Play 2000 to MLB 2000, then you'll probably disagree with my take on it and like TP2001 more than MLB 2001. Likewise, if you found MLB 2000 to be superior to TP2000, then you'll definitely like MLB 2001 better than TP2001 this year. Both games haven't really changed that much and are really minor upgrades over the previous year's release (is that really a surprise?). Please note that I gave both of these baseball games scores that were lower than what we had given the previous versions of the games. This isn't because this year's versions aren't as good, because they are indeed improvements over their predecessors; it's just that I personally believe that the games were given higher scores than they warranted and I couldn't see myself scoring either TP2001 or MLB 2001 in the high 8s or low 9s just because of the high scores given to the other games. While both TP2001 and MLB 2001 are solid offerings, they both fail to represent the sport of baseball as well as they should. It wouldn't be that big of a deal, but there were some games in the 16-bit days that had more realistic representations of the sport than any of the baseball games that you can get on the PlayStation. That's just not right. If you're wondering about where Sammy Sosa's High Heat Baseball 2001 fits in this race, we'll have a full review of the game for you later this week.", "date": "Apr 20, 2000"}
