It doesn't matter. In a hundred years you'll be dead, and everyone will know you as a part of the lucky generation around to see the changing of the world as we know it. Like the printing press, the Internet has turned our world inside out. Or maybe it's just a place where you don't have to wait two months to read your game reviews.   When we were living in the self-aware, self-referential spiral of the 90's, we all talked about how we'd immediately recognize the importance of this monumental technology, and put it to the best uses as quickly as possible. But now that we can already order DVDs from a website and get them in our underwear from a surly bike messenger, what's left? It's time for the Internet to start growing up and move beyond reproductions and puppet shows of books, TV, animation, and the Fingerhut catalog. It's time for the next step. Majestic, at least on the surface, is said step. A game that relies on all of the unique facets of the Internet, while feeling familiar to anyone who's touched any of today's popular media. But does it pull it off? Is this the entertainment revolution? To be specific, yes and no.   The original pilot moved along fairly quickly because it was designed to be completed in about a week, and was built specifically to show off all the features you'd expect when you started spending the monthly fee to get the full episodes. You worked out a complicated set of puzzles that utilized phone, email, and the Internet, you watched streaming video of all sorts, you chatted with strangers on AOL Instant Messenger, and the entire souffle cooked to completion in a classic cliffhanger with your mates in mortal danger. You started to get in touch with the characters that you help in a game, a ragtag bunch of programmers that have created a conspiracy game that, as Mike, Kendra, and Shintaro of the company Anim-X (the puppet ~designers~ of Majestic) find out, emulates the truth a bit too well. To give you more information would ruin the point of the game, which plays on clues, secrets, and conspiracies. Good stuff to convince you it was time to give the first real episode a try.  The first episode sets up new characters like a hacker extraordinaire and an old friend of Deep Throat's that acts as a safehouse for two of the programmers on the run from the dark figures of the Majestic conspiracy. The hacker introduces you to email spoofing and hacking in simplified forms, but still convincing enough to give you that thrill of being able to manipulate a security system, or mimic a major corporate figure to get off with key information. When the game works best is when it finds ways to play upon the truth, using current news and information as a jumping point for fantasy. It's an education in the subterranean, everything from the creation of an underground network when you're on the lam from the law to being able to chat your way into vital corporate information. On its own it's nothing new -- any avid reader of Scientific American will watch countless X-Files episodes pop out before their eyes -- but it's great to see such devices being implemented in a normally shallow-plotted medium. Like the X-Files, Majestic also uses past military mistakes and secrets like MK Ultra and the fabled Majestic 12, and mixes them in liberally with its own fiction, never revealing which parts of the puzzle are actually based on the real, or the imagined. It makes for a great madhouse aesthetic that's never quite played upon quite so well before, in any medium.  But Majestic could be pitched for hours just on theory. On the day to day, it doesn't quite seem as large as all that. In fact, due to the hand-holding that the game does, constantly handing you clues and prodding you to the next event, the game itself sometimes feels more like a delivery job with streaming video snacks to keep you interested. For instance, in Episode One there's a great segment where you're stuck because you've got to find out seemingly impossible personal details on a person. You're stumped, but you decide to run their name through the Majestic search and see what comes up -- simple stuff. Just before your pinky has a chance to tap that Enter key and send your brain on its merry way, you get an email from a fellow friend in the Majestic Alliance, the game's underground network of freedom fighters. ~Why don't you type so and so's name into the Majestic search engine?~ it chimes, erasing in an instant any challenge set up by the puzzle. On the other hand, when the game works, it's magic. One puzzle in Episode One puts you through hoops, chasing a radio show to listen for a secret message to use with a map from another site, also with a coded message. The trail can be incredible, especially when you're working on a puzzle that takes you from an image on a web site to a phone mail system to instant message, to email, and back to the web, and so on. But again and again, gamers seem to complain that just as things build, they go flat. Right when you're waiting for the next clue, the second step, you're forced to wait a day, or god forbid, even two for the next piece of information. I should know, I've been one of those people watching my email for hours while writing a story for work, hoping Kendra or Mike or an anonymous member sends me the URL I've been waiting to hear back about.  The second part of the equation is the storyline, a much more important figure in Majestic than in any other game before. While great gameplay can blur a critical gaze at a flawed storyline, Majestic's pacing and its character focus do just the opposite. We're watching for clues on every page, and listening in every word, so when someone's delivery doesn't quite convince us, when Kendra's hysterics seem a bit forced, it's all the more jarring. Just as the puzzles vary wildly, so the story seems to follow. An eerie, calm phone call from a company employee saying they'll be by your house in the next week to pick up a file will creep you out, and remind you why Majestic's a unique experience. A day later, Majestic will bring you back to earth with a news story that nonchalantly mentions black helicopters and men in black, as if it was a common occurrence at your neighborhood Utah motel room. Sometimes the plotline can get a little too B-Movie, and sometimes the characters play themselves too thin, dancing out scenarios rather than growing into the people you need and want to care about. To make the game jump out of web sites and emails and touch you at the level of TV, Majestic is going to have to make you worry, sweat, laugh and cry about the people you help in the game, and so far it's failed to reach that level. Finish Episode 1, however, and you'll see just how hard the game is working to move towards that goal.  Because it's neither fish nor fowl, the game's going to be fought over for months to come. Neil Young, the product's designer, will argue that it's meant for the mainstream, those with 30 minutes a day after work to jump into a living piece of interactive entertainment, not an Internet savvy version of the classic brain-buster The 7th Guest. On the other hand, a recent press event had a fellow gaming journalist scratching his head and wondering exactly why a legendary hacker would have you do a simplistic whois search on the web to find out information on a site, because the hacker is somehow at a loss for the way to do it himself. The balancing act is harder than it seems, especially when you're trying to reach beyond the hardcore game fans and out to those who would rather talk about the new co-host on Regis than the best Rocket Arena map currently on the web. The answer is none of the above. Young wants to create a game that is neither puzzler nor streaming TV. Or maybe it's both. The game's pacing is dictated by the stories and the characters, as well as the structure itself. It's meant to be eaten in bite-sized pieces, played after work, and chatted about around the office the next day. With a TV show tie-in in the works, that move towards a hybrid beast is taking shape more and more. Is it just that we've never seen entertainment doled out like this before, and so it's just something to get used to, just as radio listeners had to adapt to the shortened, stunted style of original TV shows? The proof will certainly be in the paycheck.  There's so much potential here, and Majestic is in the lucky position to garner that criticism without the addendum or the but. As an ongoing series, gameplay will change with voices of the players and the critics, and as the first of its kind, Majestic will get the sort of soft touch not reserved when talking about the new season of Friends, or David Sedaris' new book. It's an imperfect formula right now. But the moments of intrigue, and the future possibilities make this worth your gaming dollar, just to have the chance to see Majestic as it grows over the coming months. Will this change your world? Not quite yet. Will it change your gaming life in 2002? Barring a revival of  the door to door DVD man, there's a great chance.  -- Vincent Lopez Want to share your opinions with the world?
