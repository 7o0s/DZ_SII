Late last year we received the respectable Knockout Kings from Electronic Arts  a solid, though not impeccable, initial offering in the category  and now we're presented with Sony's first go at it, the Victor Interactive developed Contender.  Rather than the realistic simulation of the sport that EA's offering aimed for, Contender goes after the same arcade-style play we've become accustomed to from games such as Buster Douglass Knockout Boxing on the Sega Genesis. Despite the fact that the game is polygonal  and the ability to ~sway~ away from attacks is included  the game is a largely head-to-head experience throughout. There are mid-section punches, head punches, blocks (high and low), a more powerful ~smash~ punch, and an extra-powerful punch that must be earned (by being knocked down) before use. Get knocked down and it'll take plenty of ~X~ and ~O~ button-smashing to regain composure before being counted out.  Featuring 20 playable characters in all, the game also boasts two play modes: Main Event and Exhibition. Where the former has players punching their way through local, national, and world divisions to a hopeful championship, the latter is provided specifically for player versus player competition. Six camera views, including first-person and the odd reverse first-person mode, can be switched on the fly. Also of note is a experience system whereby player attributes (such as stamina and speed) are arbitrarily upgraded between matches. Rounding things out is a training mode via which new players can learn tactics from a grizzled, eye patch wearing veteran boxer. While I won't deny that PlayStation has been sorely lacking in the boxing category, I can safely say that we don't need games like Contender to fill the void. What had the potential to be a fun, fast-paced game has instead proven itself all-too-anemic on all fronts, ending up the gameplay equivalent of Rock'em Sock'em Robots, and maybe even less satisfying at that. Below-average on all accounts, Contender was most disappointing in regards to gameplay, or, in this case, its near total lack thereof. Despite the seemingly large array of characters (and the attribute upgrade system) everything ultimately boiled down to mashing lots of buttons until somebody falls down, mashing more buttons to get up, and, all the while, trying to fight off the sneaking suspicion that there's really no strategy involved. That is, of course, because there isn't. Sony, for its part, billed the game as ~arcade-style~ from the get-go, but even the most simplistic arcade boxing games (such as Nintendo's Punch-Out) necessitate some change in strategy to progress from one match to the next  and nearly all of them have more personality.Contender came up nearly as disappointing when its technical merit was called into question. From a design standpoint it's wholly generic, and in terms of visual and aural quality it would have been more acceptable as a first-generation product  as it stands, however, it is simply inexcusable. It's clearly a 1995 product trying to make it in 1999, and that became apparent from the moment the stilted character animation and tinny sound effects first hit me. I'd been hoping for a good arcade-style boxing game on PlayStation for a long while, but it became apparent all-too-quickly that Contender wasn't going to fit the bill, even in the slightest. What I got instead was a textbook example of mediocre game design, and one I recommend that anyone, boxing fan or not, keep clear of.", "date": "Jan 14, 1999"}
