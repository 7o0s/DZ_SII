{"name": "Def Jam Vendetta", "name_review": "Def Jam Vendetta", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/03/31/def-jam-vendetta-3", "text": "For over a decade, the rappers at Def Jam have been looking for a fight. From ~Fight the Power~ and ~Fight for Your Right to Party,~ to ~Bring the Pain~ and ~Mama Said Knock You Out,~ the label has twisted rhymes of boasts and bravado into a multi-billion dollar industry of beats and beatdowns. But how would these same rappers fare if they had to put down their mics and put up their dukes? That's the concept behind EA Big's bangin' new brawler, Def Jam Vendetta.   At its core, Vendetta's a wrestling game without the wrestlers. It's Fight Club without Brad Pitt. It's Redman picking his opponent up by the throat in the middle of the ring and punching him in the nuts so many times that you need to drop your controller and grab your sack out of some remote fear that pain might actually translate to your testicles. It's also the best wrestling game to slam the next-gen consoles to date, no doubt. Welcome to the Terrordome.  Features   Tight wrestling mechanics meet hip-hop personality in this no holds barred, over-the-top brawler  Play as one of 44 different wrestlers, including 12 actual Def Jam artists  A total of 12 funky-fresh arenas to fight in through six modes including the single-players Story mode and brutal multi-player matches  18 fully licensed, thumping Def Jam hip-hop tracks  Requires a Memory Card to save single-player progress  For one to four players simultaneous  Gameplay Designing an original wrestling game without a traditional wrestling license (i.e. WWE) proved to be a process full of ups and downs -- or smackdowns, as the case may be -- for veteran wrestling game developer Aki (WWF Wrestlemania 2000, WWF No Mercy). To its benefit, Aki was never limited to merely imitating exactly what's seen on TV in terms of presentation or even move sets. In a WWE game, for instance, if The Rock doesn't remove his elbow pad and deliver his signature raised eyebrow to the camera during the course of a People's Elbow, then wrestling fans across the globe would (and have in the past) shriek louder than Mick Foley rolling around on a mat full of thumbtacks.  By creating a world of underground fighting where the wrestlers -- 44 in all -- are a mix of fictional fighters and superstar rappers, Aki could design each character and fighting style the way that suits gameplay best and was never once forced to cater to preconceived notions of what a specific wrestler needs to fight like in the ring. When Spider delivers his version of the Rock Bottom, he doesn't just pick his opponent up and slam them to the mat ala The People's Champ. Instead, Spider picks his man up like a traditional Rock Bottom, then spins them around two times before dropping his opponent straight down on the back of his head and neck. A move so painful and nasty, it must bring a tear to The Rock's eye to think that he can't match the jaw-dropping awe that a move like this inspires.  This theory of starting from scratch also plays to Aki's benefit outside of the ring, too, as the arenas and fight locations (12 total) are some of the coolest in any wrestling game. Each rapper has a venue that matches his persona to perfection. So while Ludacris fights in an arena full of distractions including scantily clad ladies sliding down stripper poles, DMX is ~gonna give it to ya~ in The Junkyard, complete with old tires beneath the ring.  But while character and arena design work in Aki's favor, the lack of overall features and match types that wrestling fans have grown accustomed to suplex the game back down to the mat. Sure, Vendetta sports a scintillating Story mode (more on that later), as well as Singles, Tag Team, Handicap, Survival, and up to four-player Free For All bouts, but that's absolutely nothing compared to the countless match types found in WWE Smackdown!: Shut your Mouth on the PS2. There are no Battle Royals to be found. No Table matches, no Ladder matches, and, for a game that aims to be hardcore, there are no Hardcore matches and no weapons to be found in any match type, period. There are no chairs, ring bells, mics, or platinum records to smash over your opponent's head. There's not even a Spanish announcer's table to piledrive enemies through.  This is Manny. Everyone, say hello to Manny -- you'll be saving his ass in the Story mode. Again, Vendetta's not a traditional wrestling game, so you can't expect every type of match, but, at the same time, the game's still grounded in the roots of wrestling. Fans of the ~sport~ will be disappointed that more was not done to blend the two together. Another disappointment is the omission of any type of Create-A-Wrestler mode -- traditionally one of the most popular features in recent grappling games. It would have been a welcomed addition to Vendetta.      Another oddity is the actual lineup of fighters. While there are 44 wrestlers total, there are only 12 Def Jam artists. That's not completely outrageous, but the 12 aren't exactly the 12 that you'd expect from a label like Def Jam. The game features Method Man, Redman, N.O.R.E., Capone, WC, Scarface, Joe Budden, DMX, Ludacris, Keith Murray, Ghostface Killah, and Funkmaster Flex. But that begs the question, where is LL Cool J? He's been the most recognized artist on the label for years, and he's nowhere to be seen. Also MIA are Ja Rule, Jay-Z, Cam'ron, and old school rapper Slick Rick. Speaking of old school, while a Public Enemy cut is featured on the soundtrack, there's no P.E. representation in the ring. There's no Chuck D., no Flava Flav smashing fools with his clock, and not even Professor Griff or an S1W in the crowd saluting. While certainly not a game breaker, the exclusion of these artists is a bit perplexing; it's like creating a WWE game without Stone Cold.  But if the lack of features forces the game down to the mat, then it's Vendetta's brilliantly smooth gameplay that picks it back up and flexes its muscles as it struts along the road to the title. Take the N64 classic WWF No Mercy, replace all of the wrestlers with silly names like Mr. Ass with, well, rappers with silly names like Ludacris, and you pretty much know how Vendetta plays. Simply tapping the grapple button performs your basic set of moves like slams, suplexes, and headbutts. Hold the grapple button down to perform an entirely new set of more powerful moves from choke slams to the good old Stink Face. Fighters can launch themselves off of the top rope, dive through the ropes onto an opponent outside the ring, and lock adversaries in a variety of bone-breaking submission holds. Anything you've ever wanted to do in a wrestling ring can be performed in Vendetta, and, as mentioned earlier, the moves you're accustomed to seeing on shows like Raw and Smackdown are delivered with such force and flair that it makes the real thing look somewhat tame in comparison.  As players work their way through a match, utilizing a greater variety of moves encourages the crowd to cheer them on even more. And the more the crowd adores a fighter, the more his or her Momentum meter begins to fill. When the Momentum meter is completely full, they're able to deliver one of two (one from the front, one from behind) Blazin' finishing moves at their disposal. Moves like Redman's aforementioned ~Balls to the Wall~ and Method Man's ~Methalize,~ where the prankster from the slums of Shaolin picks his opponent up in a Lex Luger-like Rack, cracks the spine a few times for good measure, then drops him head first into a modified brain-buster. These are devastating moves that wrestlers could never pull off in real life for the simple fact that real people have real bones that would snap in two (if they are lucky). In the videogame-only realm of DJV, you can just hit reset.  In addition to the basic moves and finishers, each fighter features a unique set of three combos. When these combos are completed, not only will the opponent be left flattened, the momentum meter will fill up extremely fast, enabling players to move from combo to finisher in no time. The combos aren't your basic punch-punch-kick, either, as experimentation with each brawler will be necessary to see what moves link into others. For example, one of Joe Budden's combos is ~The Focus.~ Performing this move requires getting close to the opponent and then hitting him with a soft strike. Follow this up by grabbing him in a rear hard grapple and send him down to the mat. Once your opponent is down, run toward him and strike him one last time by pressing up and punch. It may not be as simple as 1-2-3, but it will lead to many pin falls throughout the game.  Getting your face beat is as fun as it gets here in Def Jam Vendetta. While Def Jam Vendetta, like all wrestling and fighting games, works best as a two-player contest, the one-player Story mode is not only refreshing in its originality, it's also rewarding in regards to all of the unlockable characters to play as in other modes. As the story goes, street fighting was too gangsta for the Garden, so a local crime boss named D-Mob decided to take the conflict underground. At first, players are simply trying to do a homey named Manny a favor by taking his spot in a few fights and earning some scratch to pay the bills. But once it's revealed that former main squeeze, Angel, now lays down with the enemy (in this case, D-Mob), players join the tournament and attempt to take the big man and his band of Def Jam fighters down -- and, in the process, prove to the former honey who the man really is. As players progress through Story mode, every fighter defeated becomes playable in other modes like Single and Free For All, and as all fighters are defeated from the same area, that area's venue also becomes unlocked.       And like all winners, the ladies in DJV flock to your side, even fighting each other for the rights to be your ~girlfriend.~ When two girls are about to fight for your rights, players choose the one that they want to win and then actually control her in the ring. If their woman wins the fight, then not only will she become a playable character in other modes, but a piece of her Gallery will be unlocked as well: a Maxim-esque photo spread of the real woman that the video game character is based on -- bikinis and all. Throughout Story mode, money is earned for every match won and it can in turn be used to either increase the character's attributes or to buy more girlfriend photos in other outfits like nightgowns and other assorted evening wear (use your imagination). Speaking of spending money, if players decide to actually get their skills working instead of their imaginations, then they can increase everything from their characters' speed and strength to their charisma. And while it may sound silly to spend money to increase a fighter's charisma, remember: This is a game based on the entertainment industry, where image is everything, and Vendetta is no different. The more charisma players boast, the more the crowd pops to their every move and the faster their Momentum meter fills, thus making the charisma attribute actually one of the most useful in the game.  One disappointing feature of the Story, however, is the fact that we can't play through the mode as any of the Def Jam rappers. Players are given four of the fictitious fighters to choose from when the story begins, and while it's always thrilling to take an unknown underdog through the ranks of the underground fighting circuit, it would've been even sweeter if the game also included some kind of storyline that enabled playing as one of the maniac musicians.  Graphics From the homies to the hotties, Vendetta delivers some of the best-looking fighter models ever to grace the squared-circle. Anyone can spot the definition in DMX's abs, the ice on Redman's ear, and the gold around Ghostface Killah's arm. Each rapper's face and trademark look is instantly identifiable for fans, and non-fans will get a kick (sometimes in the balls) from the unique styles and profiles of the men behind the mic. The game isn't meant to look realistic, but rather adapts a stylistic look with a cartoon affect that blends hints of realism with some very artistic techniques. The game's visuals work extremely well.  The atmosphere surrounding the Story mode and the cinematics that push the storyline forward are also top rope. We're talking two-way pagers, arenas with DJ's and dancing girls, and a bad-ass boss looking to intimidate your every move -- quite cool.  There are some big boys in this game, and they drop some very big hits. Sound Fans of rap music will totally dig Vendetta's soundtrack laced with a mix of old school and fresh cuts. There are 18 songs in all, including:  ~Nothin'~ - N.O.R.E. ~Smash Sumthin'~ - Redman ~Fight the Power~ - Public Enemy ~Buck 50~ - Cappadonna, Method Man, and Redman ~X Gonna Give It To Ya~ - DMX ~Bring the Pain~ - Method Man ~Uh Huh!~ - Method Man ~Focus~ - Joe Budden ~In Cold Blood~ - Scarface ~Do Sumthin~ - Comp ~Throw Ya Gunz~ - Onyx ~The Streets~ - WC, featuring Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg ~Oh My Goodness~ - Keith Murray ~Yeah Yeah You Know It~ - Keith Murray ~Intro~ - DMX ~Party Up~ - DMX ~Stick 'em~ - Comp ~Stomp~ - C-N-N  The only downer is that a bunch of the lyrics have been edited out for obvious reasons. Too bad there wasn't a version released for retail sale with a Parental Advisory sticker and the lyrics left intact -- oh well, maybe next year.  For those who love the super slick hi-fi stereo connections, Def Jam Vendetta supports Dolby Surround Pro-logic II. So hooking up the game to a bumping system will generate a clean, smooth, and big sound; given the level of bass in the game, that's a good thing.If you played Wu Tang: Shaolin Style on the PS1 and have since been scared of rapper fisticuffs ever since, don't worry. Def Jam Vendetta represents both the culture and the clash to the highest degree. Besides, word on the streets is that Method Man himself thought the Wu-Tang Clan game was whack, so you're not alone.When it comes to two-player action, you'll be hard-pressed to find a smoother, slicker slobber knocker than this wrestler. It's the game that makes The Rock look like a pebble and is a must-buy for all fans of the genre. And, as you can see by the score, it's the highest rated wrestling game on the site.", "date": "Mar 31, 2003"}
