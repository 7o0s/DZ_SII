After slogging out the crap-a-licious Street Fighter EX games and the mildly playable Rival Schools on the Playstation, they produced the godly Power Stone on the Dreamcast. Capcom's future prognosis looked rosy ? for a while, anyway. Then we got the no-frills 2D port that was Giga Wing, and now, a ghastly-looking retro-beast called Star Gladiator 2.  Star Gladiator 2 was originally a System 12 arcade game (from what they tell me, anyway ? I've never seen it in any Japanese arcades). As most of you know, the System 12 is essentially a jacked-up Playstation arcade board. And, as all of you know, the Dreamcast is obscenely more powerful than the PSX. So we'd only expect Capcom to go back and revamp Star Gladiator 2 so it could compete with the high-polygon, effects-laden brawlers of today.  But let's start with the story: a bunch of intergalactic characters have come together to beat each other up in a fighting tournament, with the grand goal being... oh, god, who even cares anymore? The gimmick here is that you've got twenty-two aliens and you can make them fight each other with their sparkly laser weapons. Aside from that, it follows exactly the same formula as the other eight billion games that Virtua Fighter spawned back in 1996.  Star Gladiator 2 controls just like Star Gladiator 1 (surprise, surprise!), combining Street Fighter-style special moves with Tekken combo cheese. You've got horizontal and vertical weapon attacks, a side-strafe button that evades attacks, and a button for kicking. Busting out the quarter-circle-forward gamepad rolls executes the expected fireballs, spin-kicks, and other what-not. Hitting either of the triggers results in a screen-filling special move, where frantic button-mashing results in outrageous combos. This is probably the game's high point, and the resulting carnage looks pretty cool.  But that's about the only visual thrill you'll get out of Star Gladiator 2, which looks like a pile of Wookiee dung in comparison to every other 3D fighter that's come out in the last year. Apparently, Capcom made no effort to create anything other than a quick and dirty port (aside from fixing the pixelization and texture distortion that plagues the PSX hardware). To be honest, it looks like a Playstation game running under Bleem. The characters are noticeably low-polygon. The backgrounds are static, 2D bitmaps. And the ground is completely flat, scaling out to infinity like in Tekken. Yeesh, no wonder they didn't opt to support the VGA box.   Aside from the incredibly average gameplay and ass-looking graphics, my biggest beef with Star Gladiator 2 is the character design. In Street Fighter II, you care about the characters. You don't want Ryu to lose a match, because Ryu is a complete badass, and has personality. But look at Star Gladiator's ~Saturn.~ He's a freaking green conehead with a Gene Simmons tongue. Hell, half of these guys look like rejects from a bad episode of He-Man or Scooby-Doo, and make the insipid characters from Street Fighter EX look like genius in comparison.  Extra features are also slim pickings. The only real bonus is a training mode, which features a ~combo map~ that displays how moves can be linked together. Aside from that, there's a group battle mode, a versus mode, and... um... an options mode, too. I'm really reaching here.  When all is said and done, Star Gladiator 2 is nothing short of incredibly average ? and when compared to Soul Calibur and Power Stone, is about as thrilling as digging the wax out of your ears. The boys at Capcom put as much effort into this one as a student who's been asked to write an essay on the life cycle of the fluke worm. Just remember that we play these games so you don't have to, and save your money.", "date": "Dec 16, 1999"}
