Still awaiting its US premiere on the PC, Killer Loop is already wrecking havoc with European arcade racing fans throughout the Old Continent as well as PlayStation owners worldwide. I have played quite a few arcade racers in my time, and it always comes down to each person's unique preferences. But if you're into speeds over 300MPH and futuristic looking vehicle flying around suspended race tracks, then German-based developer VCC Entertainment may just have what you're looking for.  The plot in Killer Loop is really a non-significant factor in the game, but as some game developer out there was recently claiming, every game has to have a story ... even Tetris. Now, without getting into an argument over the Tetris storyline, I'll lead you through the basic Killer Loop plot -- 23rd century Earth is a very peaceful and tranquil place. Wars, famine and terminal illness are a thing of the past.  Where's your precious Cocoon now, Wilfred?  Anyway ... in this century humanity has surpassed all expectations, and is now faced with a challenge of having a very stable and yet annoyingly dull community. In this age people seek new challenges, one of them being a new extreme sport institutionalized through The Magneto-Kinetic League (MKL). Yup, you've guessed it -- the MKL is a conglomerate of a lot of ridiculously fast cars, perilous tracks and entertaining weapon add-ons.  Sounds good to us!  Vehicles in Killer Loop are called Tripods. The idea behind their high velocity is that they roll on friction-balls like those found in a computer mouse. The player can choose between three manufacturers, none of them bearing any resemblance to Mercedes, VW, or BMW mind you... There is also a fourth manufacturer, but it is accessible only to those with fine looping skills and trophy rooms filled with first prize medals.  If there is one game ripe for comparison with Killer Loop then it would have to be Melbourne House's Deathkarz. Generally speaking the two games look alike, but once you get down to the real nitty-gritty hardcore stuff, it gets more than obvious that Deathkarz poses no real competition to Killer Loop.  Any comparisons in terms of the game's addictiveness and gameplay qualities would simply be unfair to Deathkarz. As far as the Loop's basic setup of cars and tracks goes, it goes something like this -- there are twelve tripods (futuristic vehicle models) and eight tracks in all. The track locations range from the snowy slopes of Himalayas A and B to the scenic landmarks of Hawaii, and then over to Mars, Hamburg Holodrom, Needle Rock, Moscow, and finally the Killer Loop itself.  I get very excited and equally frustrated when thinking about this one. You start with one of three lightweight tripods on one of four available tracks: Moscow, Himalayas A, Hawaii and Mars. From that point on it's nothing but speed baby!    Killer loop features two kinds of power-ups that you can pick up during the race: particle fields on the raceway surface and pink pyramids floating on the track. Yellow particle fields increase your maneuverability and keep you on the track, whilst the green particles serve to accelerate the Tripod. Floating pink pyramids hold different weapon power-ups, ranging from guided missiles to land mines. The weapons are very useful and downright fun, especially in multiplayer games. There are two levels of fun to be experienced while playing Killer Loop. One comes from enjoying tremendous sensation of speed and mastering the difficult tracks, while the other comes after gaining certain skill and mixing it up with other humans. The game's AI is solid enough, and will pose a challenge for the player possessing early skill levels.  But once you've conquered the frustrations of losing speed, or having too much of it, and learned how to use the particle fields and weapons to your advantage, I suggest throwing a small LAN party and getting into some furious competition with your friends. This is where the real fun lies!   One thing is certain about the Killer Loop visuals -- they are compact and hip. Although these words may seem odd for describing game graphics, they best explain the overall appearance of the title. There is nothing obscenely stunning about the graphics. It's not like the wire frame of the models is GeForce demo material, but each is so well put together, with such a skillful design, that they easily compensate for the lack of more complex 3D models. All of the tracks are simply magnificent, with steep roller coaster-like bends and slopes, surrounded by dynamic and imaginative scenery representative of the different track locations. The usual dynamic lighting with fancy lens flare effects adds nice touches of color to the scene, and the tripods, although the models are fairly simple, still contain a lot of futuristic elements that make them fit the game's profile perfectly.   Berlin and Germany are famous for their wild rave parties, and I can definitely say that Killer Loop has some traces of that spirit implemented into the design. The Hawaii track is a masterful example as it features some of the most extraordinary underwater tunnels I've seen in a game.  It makes you feel like you are rushing 300MPH through giant aquariums in an adrenaline-charged, insanely fast death race.   As I have already mentioned, Germany is famous for its rave parties, so naturally all the musical selections on the CD carry that familiar techno-beat.  What is interesting though is that the tracks don't get tedious after a few hours of playing. I should note that I'm not a big techno fan, so even I was surprised at how good the musical tracks were. The sound effects are nothing out of the ordinary, with no real innovation or serious breakthroughs. The weapon add-ons sound solid, although it would've been nice if they were louder and more spectacular. Driving over a land mine in the game should have sounded a lot more bombastic as it would bring even more action into gameplay. Overall, sounds and visuals are very good, but nothing overly exciting or ground-breaking.  Killer Loop's gameplay is all about speed. If you lose speed, you lose the race. Even the weapon power-ups serve only to the purpose of slowing the other competitors down, and making them lose precious speed. On the other hand, too much speed is not good either.  The physics model is so incredibly good that you have to find just the right balance between good steering and high velocity to stay on top of the heap without flying off the track. Talk about an amazing physics engine ... the folks at VCC folks claim, and may I add rightfully so, that, ~Each player has the physical forces of gravity, friction, mass and a dozen more parameters at their fingertips.~ They couldn't be more right! It's pointless for me to try to explain any further. It's like trying to explain why playing Quake 3 ~feels~ so good. It just does, and it has to do with some very skillful computer engineering. I know this may sound a bit pretentious to some -- comparing Quake 3's feel with the Killer Loop physics engine -- but if you doubt my words, you can always try out the game for yourself!   In the early stages of your killer looping, I suggest stacking up a few bottles of whatever calms your nerves best. Losing your momentum and going backwards after you have missed the green acceleration particles may stress you out a tad, and hitting an opposing player's landmine does tend to make some of us rather irritated as well -- but in the end, it's all worth it.  Killer Loop is one of the best arcade racers I've played in years, and it's definitely worth laying down your hard earned money for.   There just isn't an arcade racer out there they combines speed, a great feeling physics engine, and innovative track design like Killer Loop.  Now if Crave would just get this bad boy out in the States ...    -- Uros Jojic Not a terrible game, but not too exciting either. There's no two player game to add to the appeal, and the actual tournament is not quite stimulating. What's worse, the game design isn't too impressive. Tracks are a bit too tightly bound to really let you open up the speed, the magnet power isn't as effective as could be, and the MK vehicles steer as if they're futuristically powered magic bricks.", "date": "Mar 7, 2000"}
