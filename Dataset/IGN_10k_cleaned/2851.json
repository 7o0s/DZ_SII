A game where Cory Nastazio cannot do a tabletop is not doing justice to the sport.  Activision obviously recognized the game's failings and enlisted Rainbow Studios to take over for the sequel, resulting in a game that is entirely new in every way -- the technology, animation, and game mechanics are all new, with the only holdover being the various famous names.  But now, the problems have been reversed, somewhat,  This is a killer BMX sim, but it may not as much fun to play as you think.  If all you want to do is ride, Mat Hoffman 2 is your game.  The trick selection and bike control are both top-notch, the graphics engine inspires no complaints, and it presents the sport in a uniquely relaxed, low-key way.  The single-player mode is presented as a road trip, moving from level to level with little slice-of-BMX-life video clips in between.  The trouble, however, is advancing from level to level.  The objective structure is designed such that you get hung up on a single task far too easily and far too often.  This wouldn't be as much of a problem if it didn't limit the selection of levels so badly at times.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, to my mind, had a much better progression structure -- it was still reasonably challenging, but it opened up new levels more quickly.  It's not as if this limited the replay value of the game in any way, considering how much it's been played by us and so many others around the world, and it cut down on the amount of time spent hurling yourself at a particular gap, transfer, or line.  Mat Hoffman 2 is frequently all about hurling yourself at a single task, over and over again, and it holds back the potential of what is otherwise a very well-designed game.  Gameplay The first game's problem wasn't necessarily that it recycled the Tony Hawk control scheme.  That wasn't such a bad idea in concept.  It fell down, though, when its developers fitted it out with a very questionable physics model and a small, random selection of tricks.  Like I say, Cory Nastazio couldn't do a tabletop, which looked awfully silly in comparison to the broad and versatile trick system in the competing Dave Mirra.  A couple of very poor level designs were the icing on a disappointing cake.  Rainbow Studios has fixed more or less all of that.  Mat Hoffman 2's trick system still obviously derives from Tony Hawk, but there are many more tricks, mapped to double-tap commands and the like, and it includes an expanded flatland system that works a fair bit better than the one in Tony Hawk 3.  Flatland tricks are simply face button commands performed in a manual -- there aren't quite so many of them as I'd like (I'd rather see a selection of more easily-linked basic tricks, rather than such a wide gulf between the simple tricks and the huge canned combos), but the animation for what tricks there are is excellent.  On a more basic level, the bike behavior in this game is quite good.  Rainbow obviously has a lot of experience simulating the physics of two-wheeled vehicles, and it shows here.  You still see the odd unrealistic landing, and some movement in the air that bends the suspension of disbelief (there's just one center of gravity, so the turning looks a little odd), but when you crash in this game, the bikes fly very well.  It's a pity the levels all have solid boundaries, so you can't do the old Motocross Madness trick and try and ride across the edge of the world, because that would produce some excellent bails.  It's fun to ride, then, fun to do tricks, and Rainbow's level design provides plenty of opportunities to create lines and combinations.  The levels are good-sized, a fair bit bigger than those in Tony Hawk 3, but there's more than enough architecture to fill them -- it's not like the New York level in the first game, which had far too much empty space for its own good.  In particular, Rainbow's designers have the knack for building up along the vertical axis, adding more layers of rails and lines.  So what is the problem?  Well, this requires a little math.  Like any game in this genre, Mat Hoffman 2 presents a series of challenges to be accomplished in each level.  In this case, there are twelve per level, grouped into three categories -- rookie, semi-pro, and pro.  You only have access to one level at a time, so all four tricks in that level must be cleared before you can do the next four, and so on.  Completing a level earns a certain number of road trip points, which are spent to unlock new levels.  The higher the level, the more points you earn, but the price of levels increases as you unlock more.  The way the numbers add up, anyway, means that you fairly quickly run into a bit of a wall, round about the third level.  Many of the challenges are difficult and tedious -- the ~fetch five [whatever]~ quests are particularly nasty, thanks to the bigger levels -- and others just aren't explained properly.  New Orleans, for example, requires that you ~'Flip' Out The Jazz Trio~ in order to complete the pro level.  No explanation is given regarding what that means.  Is this fun, really?  Dinking around the same three halfpipes, trying to figure out which variation on a backflip might trigger whatever's supposed to happen?  Tony Hawk had a little of this, with tasks like ~Help the Thin Man,~ but it never stymied me the way Mat Hoffman does.  The different levels also aren't anywhere near consistent as far as the difficulty of the tasks grouped together.  To use New Orleans as an example again, the semi-pro level includes three tasks that are ridiculously easy and one that's cursed hard.  If these are meant to represent gradations of the player's skill, they ought to be grouped together more appropriately.  It's unfortunate that progression becomes so tedious, because I really wanted to see more of these road-trip videos.  Scattered in between different levels, the videos in Mat Hoffman 2 aren't necessarily just a continuous stream of big tricks.  Many of them don't have any tricks at all -- they're just little bits of the road trip taken to promote the game.  It's an open question whether those who don't follow BMX or any of the personalities featured will find it all that compelling, but as a follower of the sport, I thought this was a nice change of pace.  Many of the clips are, if nothing else, very funny, although the punch line occasionally gets a little lost.  I still can't figure out why Nate Wessel wanted to kill Ruben Alcantara, for instance.  Perhaps I'm just impatient.  The pace of progression through the single-player game in earlier titles in the genre has been pretty quick, after all.  But the fact of the matter is that all the Tony Hawk games were just fine without making the challenges this difficult -- I still played them for hours on end after unlocking all the levels, and I got to spend that time trying the lines I wanted to try, rather than the same particular line I had to hit to get that last little widget.    If you just want to tool around and do tricks, the multiplayer and park editor modes serve their purpose in that regard.  Park editor has three basic themes and a part selection about on order with Tony Hawk 2, plus much more space to work with than in that game.  If you're annoyed about the game's unwillingness to unlock its levels for you, hey, go ahead and make your own.    Graphics Exactly what, if any, games this shares technology with, I'm not sure.  There are just a few times where I catch a hint of ATV Offroad Fury in the animation, but for the most part, Mat Hoffman 2 just looks like itself, which is just fine.  It's even better than Tony Hawk 3 in some ways, particularly when you consider the amount of effort required to model and animate the bikes properly.  The levels are larger and have at least as much texture detail, plus the expected selection of passersby and other animated background objects.  Almost all the trick animations are dialed right -- I think the tailwhip could use a few more frames, but those happen so fast in reality that I suppose the speed of that animation could be justified.  In particular, the flatland tricks look excellent (again, if only there could be more of them).  Crashes, however, are what Rainbow has always done best, and there are a million ways to throw your bike in this game.  Thus set free, the bikes animate perfectly, whether it's the cranks, the wheels, or the fork.  I even think they may have gone to the trouble to model different crank types -- Profiles for some riders, Primos for others -- although I can't focus on them quite that closely.  The odd problems with collision detection still abide, as they probably always will in games like this.  It's still possible to intersect with the background at completely wrong angles, and I even fell through the architecture on one occasion.  That, however, was probably something to do with the bail routines, since I never actually fell through a seam during gameplay.  What glitches do appear in Mat Hoffman 2 are mainly of the very tolerable kind.  Sound One thing you could say for the original Mat Hoffman is that it was great fun to listen to.  I'd still call it the best licensed soundtrack I've ever heard, even if it didn't have any Motorhead.  In comparison, the sequel falls a little short, the victim of some poor licensing decisions.  I was terribly excited when I first heard it would include ~Institutionalized~ by Suicidal Tendencies, but for some reason it's the weak remake version from Suicidal For Life..  ~Return of the Living Bassheads~ isn't bad as remixes go, but it's not half as effective as the Public Enemy original.  Or ~Rebel Without A Pause,~ if you want something really good from that album.  I shouldn't complain so loudly -- on balance, this is a very good mix of rock, hip-hop, and electronic whatnot, with much of the same character as the first game, and the presence of another Bad Brains track (~I Against I~) ought to be enough to keep me happy.  But this still isn't as fun to listen to as the first game, or the Motorhead-powered Tony Hawk 3.  As far as issues that were in the developer's control, the sound effects are mostly of the familiar sort, but it's a good suite all round (the ~whoof!~ of a bail is a personal favorite), and there are some neat pieces of engineering when elements of the background interact with the soundtrack.  In New Orleans, for example, the jazz combo fades in and out depending on your proximity, mixing with or replacing the ordinary background music tracks.    Oh, and as should be the norm for all Xbox games, Hoffman allows for customizable soundtracks.As always, your mileage may vary.  I definitely recommend that fans of the genre or the sport try this game, because it does almost everything very well.  There's absolutely no reason to give it a pass because you were diappointed in the first Mat Hoffman, because the two games have nothing besides the name in common.  Maybe those with more patience or persistence than I will be able to get more out of it.I still think, however, that this would have been more fun, and no less replayable, if Rainbow had dialed down the difficulty a little bit.  Re-jigger the numbers to open levels more quickly.  Maybe make more tasks available at once, so you could address yourself to more different challenges -- four is a little on the thin side.  Or keep the most difficult challenges, but attach different rewards to them, again opening levels a little more quickly.In any event, try it for yourself.  In the meantime, I'll go hurl myself at this transfer for a while.", "date": "Aug 13, 2002"}
