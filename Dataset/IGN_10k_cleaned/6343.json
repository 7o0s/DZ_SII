Unfortunately, while some steps were taken to freshen the game up for a return to active duty, it still falls woefully short of current-day standards in terms of presentation and gameplay.  Assuming one of several alignments, players summon an army of monsters to wage turn-based battle on a hex-based world map in an effort to gain control of their opponent's towers, gaining the ability to summon more monsters (and lessening their opponent's ability to do so) in the process. Several types of monsters are available at the get-go, with further varieties accessible through a ~breeding~ process later on. Once all of your opponent's monsters have been killed, and their towers captured, the game is won.  It's a simple concept  unfortunately far too simple for a current-day strategy title. Nothing more than an elaborate game of chess, it lacks the depth and opponent AI required to warrant repeat play. It's not the same game every time, but it's pretty close. A four-player mode has been included to help boost replay value, but it doesn't hide the fact that Master of Monsters is, at its heart, a very simplistic and out-dated experience.  Although the graphics have been changed, the game still falls sorely short of 32-bit titles in terms on presentation. Visually it's nothing more to look at than a good Super Nintendo title, the sound effects are dull, and the music is one unimaginative, droning loop  in other words, it's nothing you couldn't get on 16-bit. That's not exactly something you want in a genre populated by the likes of Final Fantasy Tactics and The Unholy War.  With superb titles like these on shelves, Master of Monsters just doesn't have what it takes to warrant purchase, and instead serves as a prime example of how not to re-make a 16-bit title when given the chance. Even if you're dying for a new strategy game, you'll want to pass.  Randy Nelson", "date": "Dec 16, 1998"}
