Why?  I have no idea.  We can watch cars race in endless circles in NASCAR, but are not interested in watching cars race through varied terrain across natural land, as well as varied weather conditions.  Whatever.  I'm just glad that we can experience rally racing through videogames.  Rally Fusion is the newest racing game from Activision, and developer Climax.  Climax is also the one responsible for the excellent MotoGP: Ultimate Racing Technology, but instead of going for high-realism as with MotoGP, Rally Fusion leans more to the arcade side of things.  How do things turn out?  Not too bad.GameplayRally Fusion features 20 different cars from an assortment of makers including Ford, Toyota, Opel, Peugeot, and Audi.  There are even 6 Group B cars.  These are cars that have been banned from World Rally Championships due to the fact that they are so powerful.  If you ask me, more power sounds like more fun, but rules are rules.  Each car has varying stats that cover speed, acceleration, handling, and strength.  The beginning cars are really weak, but do get the job done for the early races.  The cars you unlock later in the game are much better stat-wise, but don't feel drastically different from the others.  There are also nine different racing environments divided into 20 tracks.  What's strange is that all the levels feel very similar, regardless of if you're racing on ice, mud, or sand.  For a rally racing game, that's not exactly what I expected, but I guess it does fall more in line with Rally Fusion's arcade approach.  Still, you should be able feel the difference in terrain a little.  This is supposed to be rally racing game, isn't it?Rally Fusion's main quest-type mode is the ROC Challenge.  It is divided up into four classes, the first being Qualifiers.  In it, you'll have to complete four challenges such as a head-to-head race, a driving challenge with cones, and a time attack race.  After completing these, you can move on to the Class C races, then the Class B races, and finally to the Class A races.  When you first start a Class, there are only three races available.  After you complete them and think you can move on to the next class, another race pops up.  Then another.  And another.  Eventually the number of races in the class is almost triple what you initially expected.  For some reason, I found this humorous.  Don't ask why.  Each class of races is made up of a variety of different races, though in the beginning they mostly consist of racing three races across varied terrain.  You will also race duels to gain better cars and also complete more driving challenges, which have you racing around a track while driving between cones.  You almost always have to place first to win the challenges.  Some may find this a little frustrating because if you happen do well in the first two races, then do somewhat poorly in the third, you may have to start the entire challenge over again.  It would have been nice to be able save between each race, but luckily the races are short enough that you won't have to take too much time repeat it.As you work your way through the different classes, different types of races will open up.  In total, there are nine different types of races you will have to compete in to win.  Everything from Hill Climbing, to Checkpoint, to Elimination races.  The variety of races keeps the game from feeling too stale, and they are challenging enough that you definitely won't win them on your first try. See the snow? There is also a Custom Championship mode, as well as a Race of Champions mode.  The Custom Championship mode let you create your own rally, rally cross, or circuit championship, while the Race of Champions mode will let you race in the legendary Race of Champions race held in Gran Canaria.  This race is setup as a knockout tournament in which you must win 2 out of 3 heats in order to progress.  You can also play this mode as a Nations Cup where there are teams, and you can join forces with other players to form a new team.  Besides the ROC Challenge, Custom Championship, and Race of Champions modes, there is a Quick Race mode that is broken down into 11 different types of races.  Many of these are the types of races you'll race in the ROC Challenge mode, but in Quick Race you can select the levels and cars, and you can also play these modes in multi-player.  One of the coolest modes is the Follow the Leader mode.  Like in Tokyo Extreme Racing, each driver has an energy bar that depletes whenever they are not in the lead.  This makes for some intense races, especially with a group of 3 of your friends.  Many of the other modes are also locked, which helps add incentive to finishing this challenging game.  Unfortunately, part of what makes this game as challenging as it is, is the physics.  First off, your car just doesn't feel as heavy as it should.  Instead, it feels like you're driving a car with nothing under the hood.  This especially becomes noticeable when racing other cars.  It's very easy to turn cars over just by running into them.  Also, when powersliding, your car REALLY powerslides, with an emphasis on the sliding part.  You sometimes contemplate how far your car will slide before it actually stops.  Rather than help you in making turns, the exaggerated powersliding hinders your ability to win the race.  You can eventually learn to compensate for it for the most part after you've learned the general feel, but there are still occasions where you'll think you'll know what you're doing but end up crashing into a wall.     GraphicsRally Fusion is a fantastic looking game.  The cars look great with their high-polygon models and sharp textures, and if you look closely, there are even real-time reflections on them.  Unlike a lot of other racing games where the car reflections are almost too drastic, making the cars look more like mirrors than metal, the car reflections in Rally Fusion are subtle and convincing. The cars in Rally Fusion also take damage, though rather than dents, you're more likely to see your bumper fall off.  Or your hood fly away.  Your doors will fly open if you bash them hard enough, and then maintain swinging in and out depending on which way you're turning.  There are also a few other minor details, like animated drivers and cracked windshields.The best looking tracks are the ones with rain.  Water droplets stick to the screen and distort colors and reflections.  Lightning flashes and lights up the sky in an almost eerie way.  The road, slick with water, reflects the car's multiple lights, as well as the environment.  Mist rises and slow dissipates as you drive through it.  These levels just look awesome.  In fact, they're very comparable to the raining tracks in Climax's other racing game, MotoGP: Ultimate Racing Technology.  You never really tire of the effect either.    The rest of the tracks also look good, though a slight notch below the raining tracks.  There's almost no draw-in, and everything moves at a steady 60 fps, even with 5 other cars on the screen.  Overall, everything is solid and well done.  What keeps this from being the best-looking rally racer on Xbox is the lack of more bump-mapping and other effects, like volumetric grass.  You do see some great effects, just not enough.   I like see-through grass a lot. SoundThe sound in Rally Fusion consists of three main elements: the sound of your car, the sound of your passenger, and the music during the menus.  The menu music is just your standard ~hip~ rock music.  I can' tell if it's licensed or original, but it doesn't interest me enough to find out either.  During a race, there is no music - just the sound of your car and your passenger.  Your passenger will tell you what kind of turn is coming up by blurting out things like ~hard left~ or ~slight right.~  If you crash, he'll also wonder what the hell's wrong with you.  Even though you hear his voice a lot, it's not really bothersome.  If you do find it irritating, you can always turn him off.  The only other real sound you hear when racing is the sound of your car, which are a little weak and don?t really give me impression that I'm driving a high-powered car.Of course there's other sounds like the crowds cheering and the varying terrain as you're racing, but overall, it's pretty sparse.  The only real standout moment for sound is in the Inca stage.  The thunder and rain sounds are so good they'll make you want to reach for an umbrella.  Good stuff.Rally Fusion is great looking, average-playing racing game.  The floaty feel of your car, along with the wacky physics keep the game from being any deeper than a petri dish, but it can enjoyed in brief spurts.  This is one game where I would really recommend a rental first.  Some people will really like the over-the-top physics, while others won't.  With so many great racing games on Xbox, Rally Fusion has a tough time keeping up with the competition.  If you want a great rally racing game, your first choice should be RalliSport Challenge.  If you want to try something new and a little more pickup-and-play, give Rally Fusion a try.  You might like it.", "date": "Nov 18, 2002"}
