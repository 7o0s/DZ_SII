You take the role of Curtis Hewitt, an American who gets lost at sea after a storm mysteriously sinks the massive ocean liner he's riding on.  Adrift after the wreck, he's sucked into a water vortex and plunged into the world of Atlantis, which apparently exists on the inside of our world, or something like that.  The world is populated mostly by people who fear or enforce the will of the gods.  Being an outsider, you are quickly labeled a ~deviant~ and shot about 800 times with laser pistols.  Seriously, you get shot a lot of times, many times for no apparently reason, which leads into one of the games major problems....   A lot of things just don't make sense, such as the lack of lables for basic menu options.  Abstract shapes litter the screen, which use mouse over pop ups to highlight their purpose.  The same goes for all subset menus, such as graphics and sound, assuming you can find them. While this is alright for in game mechanics, menu systems should be clear and straight forward with their uses. As far as the game options go, there simply aren't that many.  There is no screen resolution control, only ~smooth mode~ which smoothes out jagged edges, and the option to change between 16-bit to 32-bit color.  The sound options allow you to control levels, such as music and voice, but nothing else.   Now, menus are important as a gateway, but it's what's inside that counts... such as controlling your character.  It's simple enough, in a first person view you point at an area, the cursor will change shape and with a click, you move forward.  However, you'll find yourself getting easily disoriented, which is mostly due to the backgrounds being too crowded.  There's so much, for lack of a better word, ~stuff~ in the background, that every time you jump forward you have to look around and completely reorient yourself, which often involves backtracking and retracing steps in order to become familiar with how each screen is related.  This could have been solved by putting a compass or some other directional indicator onscreen.     Interacting with items is pretty straightforward, and items that need to be picked up are generally identifiable.  Right clicking the mouse brings up your inventory, where you can combine items (lantern plus matches = lit lantern!) and then use them onscreen.  It's also possible to look up close at items, which fools the player into thinking that items can be manipulated, but alas, they cannot.  The puzzles are fairly ordinary, just find the items, combine them if necessary, and then plug into the puzzle.  In some instances the puzzles are timing based, and require numerous retries to get it right.   Talking to in-game characters is a painful experience.  Dialogue options pop up in the form of little pictures of characters and objects.  Basically, you click the pictures with no idea what your character is about to ask or say, and no idea what the response will be.  Whoever you're talking to might end the conversation altogether because you managed to insult him, when all you did was click on a picture of yourself.  It proves to be a very frustrating experience, turning every conversation into a scratch-off lottery ticket, where the only thing assured is the aggravation caused by the time you've exhausted using all your options.   And it gets worse.  Every question and response in conversation is accompanied by a separate cinematic cut scene.  This may sound cool, but it just stretches what is already a grueling experience.  It's easy to imagine that each of these characters has been tied down and injected with a gallon of Novocain considering of how their mouths sync with what they're saying.    What is impressive is that every conversation is fully voiced.  Unfortunately, the voices range from passable to grating.  Most of the NPC's have very little to say, and repeat essentially the same thing for every response.  The protagonist is the easiest to listen to, which is good considering he does a lot of talking, but still, he makes too many smart-alecky comments.  Considering he's been dumped into an alien world, why is he such a wise ass?  Wouldn't he be much more attentive to the people he talks to? Maybe so he can figure out what's happening to him and what he can do about it?  For example, in a moment of lashing wit, while observing an obviously alien object, the main character comments ~I've never seen anything like this before, even in New York City,~ and you just want to smack him upside the head and scream ~No crap!~   But the game does have some better parts, such as the cinematics and ambient sound effects.  There are lots of cinematics, as every major action, puzzle manipulation, and conversation is accompanied by one, and they can be quite pretty. They may not be close to the next-generation games currently on store shelves and soon to be released, but they're still nice to see.  The problem is with the conversation cinematics, which get repetitive quickly.  Sadly, the developers seem to have spent most of their time on this area as the regular in game graphics are static and boring.  You can be in the middle of a dense forest or a vast ocean, but absolutely nothing moves!  You might expect a leaf to move once and a while, or a pond to ripple, but that's not the case here. Though many areas are detailed, sometimes overly so, the lack of movement and interaction makes it very difficult to become immersed in the game world.   The ambient sounds and music stick out, not necessarily as excellent, but certainly unique.  Many times the effects are strange; clicks and whistles and odd horns in some areas, pounding techno in others.  There is a wide range of effects, and while not all are easy to listen to, they definitely provide a characteristic sound for each area.     A few more nagging issues include saving your game and death.  There are no save game slots.  Instead, there's a save button that overwrites your file every time.  In the event that you want to reload a game to try a different conversation route, you're out of luck.  So, if you really want to find out what you missed, you need to replay the game, which, in a title plagued with problems such as this, is a scary thought.  Dying in Atlantis, though sometimes hilarious and satisfying, is ultimately annoying, as it forces you to restart the area you're in.  This means frequently retracing your steps though screens that give little to no sense of how you're supposed to get to the next one, making doing your taxes seem like a lively, lucid activity.  If and only if you're a hardcore adventure gamer who absolutely cannot continue to exist unless they conquer every adventure game ever made should you consider purchasing this title.  Otherwise, steer clear.  It has a few redeeming qualities, but for the most part Atlantis: Evolution is a confusing, annoying experience that does not deserve space on your hard drive.", "date": "Oct 25, 2004"}
