If you've played the other two games in the series, you're in for pretty much of the same good game. 989 Studios and Sony have joined forces one last time on PlayStation, before they make the leap to PS2 sometime next year.    In the Syphon Filter series players control Gabe Logan, an intelligence agent for the United States Government.  As Gabe, players are sent all over the world to stop the deadly Syphon Filter virus. Along the way players perform the typical saving-the-world thing, rescuing hostages, killing terrorists, and making sure good old Uncle Sam stays on top of the global food chain.  Oh yeah!   In this third chapter of the Syphon Filter trilogy, Gabe Logan must defend himself against a new enemy, the U.S. government.  Apparently after their last mission the Syphon Filter team was suspected of treason.  Gabe's whole team is under trial by Secretary of State, Vincent Hadden, who is convinced these patriots are traitors and will do everything in his power to prove it.   Gameplay Unlike the previous Syphon Filter games I wouldn't exactly say this game stars Gabe Logan.  Syphon Filter 3 takes a different story-telling approach.  While Gabe and his team are explaining how they met, the game takes you back in time.  Players have the chance to take on the role of the character telling the story.  For example, Lian Xing tells the story of how she met Gabe Logan, and then bam! There you are, playing Lian, in the middle of the jungle awaiting your mission orders.  It's a nice change of pace though every agent's arsenal is basically the same.    The controls are nice.  If you've played the other games there's no difference. You have your basic strafe, lock on, shoot, roll, duck, manual target, and action buttons. Admittedly, the game hasn't sped up, or become much smoother, so you won't be in for any new thrills in that department.  Still, the control that bugs me the most is the lock-on button.  This button auto aims for you; usually it will lock on to the chest area of your enemy.  The big problem I have with it is when there are several enemies on the screen.  Now you'd think the game would lock on to the closest enemy directly in front of you.  But, oh no, it decides who to target on a case-by-case basis.  Sometimes the game will target the opponent farthest away from you.  Other times it will lock on to an enemy directly behind you.  And sometimes, just sometimes, the game will target a guy right in front of you.  Not knowing who or where your weapon will target, became very frustrating as I yelled at the game, ~Not there, you idiot!~ It doesn't matter what kind of arsenal you have, especially when you're aiming at some guy, sniping behind a wall, 2 miles behind you. It's something I was able to overcome, but it wasn't the most tactical control function.   Weapons Speaking of arsenals, I bet you're wondering what kind of heat Gabe and the gang are packing. Here's the rundown of weapons in the game:  Silenced 9mm Falcon .45 Handgun Biz-2 Machine Pistol HK-5 Machine Pistol Spyder Skorpian G018 Machine Pistol Mars Sub Machine Gun M-16 Assault Rifle PK-102 Assault Rifle K364 Assault Rifle Sniper Rifle (Silenced) Night vision Rifle H11 Sniper Rifle AUG Assault Rifle, Silenced 12 Gauge Shotgun MIL-15 Shotgun UAS-12 Rapid Fire Shotgun Maks Shotgun  Combat Knife C-4 Mine Air Taser Crossbow with Laser Incendiary Grenade Nerve Gas Grenade M-79 Grenade Launcher Flack Jacket  Minefield Detector  Night vision Goggles Camera   By far my favorite weapon in this lineup has always been Air Taser.  Why?  First of all, this weapon is unique to the series.  Off the top of my head I can't think of any game that has this weapon.  But the real reason I love the Air Taser is the shear fact that when you use this weapon it causes the enemy to shake violently, scream in horror, then burst into flames.  Cracks me up every time!  Why make the enemy's death quick and painless, when you can make them cry out in terror as they vibrate into fiery explosion?  Levels There are 19 intense levels all told. All of the levels are taken from different locations throughout the world, which range from the Australian Outback to the mines of South Africa.  Each level possesses a mission unique, for exmaple, in the Australian Outback you must help cure diseased Aborigines as Chinese Operative Lian Xing (I kid you not, this is the mission).  In the mines of South Africa you play Lawrence Mujari, a South African agent, and with the help of his fellow agents, he drives to free slaves (No, I'm serious).    By far my favorite and most challenging level is Paradise Ridge.  You start out killing these rednecks (real stereotypical rednecks, mind you) who carry shotguns, and who yell, ~Git off our land!~ (I know it's wrong to call them this, but what else could they possibly be?) But as soon as you find out the FBI agents you're working with aren't on the up and up, you decide to change sides. Except the rednecks don't realize this and as you kill your fellow FBI agents, you feel this sharp stinging pain as rednecks take shotgun blasts at your back.    But I'm not done, no, not by a long shot. Even though the Redneck mission changes, players stay in the country for two -- TWO -- more levels. In these following missions, players must protect the righteous rednecks and kill the evil FBI agents. Except there's one more twist.  Apparently, you meet the pregnant wife and son of the redneck leader and it's your job to escort them to safety (by now you're probably convinced I'm just making it up as I go, but I swear to you this is how the level is!). So while you wait for a very slow pregnant woman you also have to protect a shotgun-wielding testosterone pumped teenager.  Graphics The graphics in the game are pretty much the same.  If you played Syphon Filter 1 and 2 you won't notice any spectacular change.  The graphics aren't bad, and considering the game's on PlayStation the levels are pretty big.    Now we come to the best part of the game, and by best I mean funniest part.  Gabe Logan and his infamous running animation.  Now I know there are those of you out there who believe ~Hey man, it's hella realistic, he runs like a real commando!~  Oh come on, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just a funny thing.  But I'm here to tell you that in Syphon Filter 3 they've changed the running animation.  It's not as bad as the first 2 games, where it looked like he was wearing a diaper with a full load, but it's still pretty funny.  He's now just wearing a diaper, with no poo.    Sound The sound was decent.  It wasn't phenomenal, but it wasn't that bad.  The voice actors of Gabe and Lian are back to give their ~exceptional~ performances.  The weapons sound fairly realistic, I say this because I've never actually seen or heard C-4 explode.  The music plays quietly in the background and does not hinder the gameplay in any way.   Extras If you like replay value, this is the section to read.  From the first time you put Syphon Filter 3 in your PlayStation there is an option to select a two-player mode.  In this mode you go head-to-head with one of your friends attempting to take his/her life.  There are 27 characters and 10 areas to choose from (Pick the bag-lady, she's my favorite...character, not location.)  The controls play exactly the same as single-player mode.    Now, if you're like me and you like playing Counterstrike on the PC, this game is definitely not going to suit you.  Playing a third-person versus death match feels kind of funny.  Going from first-person to third-person in the realm of one-on-one, or even multiplayer, action is kind of weird.  The controls don't work as well and you can't take your time like you can in the single-player mode.  The same characters that are in the versus mode are available in the mini games mode.  The mini games are unlocked after you beat the game.  There are several mini games, Thief, Elimination, Demolition, Assassin, and Biathlon.  Thief: you steal a briefcase from the enemy and return it to your starting position.  Elimination: you must kill other agents bent on killing you.  Demolition: you locate bombs and provide cover fire while a demolitions expert defuses the bomb.  Assassin: with the sniper rifle you must kill people without being detected.  Biathlon:  destroy all the targets from specific firing positions within the allotted time.  Defeating these modes unlocks a harder mode for each mini game.  For example in thief mode by beating trainee you unlock rookie, which gives you more enemies and less time to finish the mission.Syphon Filter 3 is a good game.  I've played my share of third-person espionage games and I'd say this game ranks pretty high.  It's no Metal Gear Solid 2: Son's of Liberty, but at least it's not Nuclear Dawn.  I had a lot of fun with this one. It was challenging without being completely impossible. The developers didn't dumb the missions down by telling you exactly where to go. It simply gives you tasks and you have to find out what to do and where to go. I like how the story traveled from one person to another, so you didn't have to stick with Gabe throughout the entire game.  I did have a problem with the versus mode.  I simply couldn't get into it.  The controls are good for a one-player spy espionage game, not a versus shoot-em up.  The targeting mode is fine if you have one target or several stable targets to select from.  But once you get two or more moving shooting targets that's when you're in trouble.  So, if you don't have a PS2, then of course you don't have Metal Gear Solid 2, and you do own a PlayStation, this is the game for you.", "date": "Nov 28, 2001"}
