With a cavalcade of big rigs and diesel burning  engines, this cute little game is sure to please car-seat bound kids when away from their toyboxes. While the game itself isn't breakthrough entertainment, its simple pleasure may be enough for young truckers.   Features:  26 stages of construction action. 5 different construction zones. 11 real Caterpiller trucks and machines to get the job done. Statistics and diagrams on each truck. Password saves for game progress. For the Game Boy Color and standard Game Boy.    In this game, players take control of a fleet of trucks, transports, and  tractors to farm a countryside, assemble a neighborhood, repair a ramshackle  forest area, and eventually construct a city. Each truck has a specific task,  whether it be lifting flats with the fork lift, picking up loads of girders  with the crane, or pushing boulders with the bulldozer.  If you don't love trucks, there's not much reason to play Matchbox Cat  Construction Zone. It's hardly a puzzle game, with easy objectives that  rarely overlap. Trucks have different jobs, but they all essentially take one  object and bring it somewhere else. There are street pavers and farm  threshers for special jobs, but these machines only come out every now and  then.  This is a kids game, for blue collar kid at that, but certainly the game has  its charms. For one, driving the trucks is a fun challenge, as these diesel  monsters don't turn on a dime or speed down the streets. Truck drivers must  pull the trucks through turns and then back into driveways, or circle back  around the block to bring their load in, just like real trucks. Also, the  level of detail in the graphics and sound is spectacular for a kids game. The  colors are bright and detailed, showing off the cows at pasture in the fields  you are fencing in and the fish leaping at the dam you are building. Your  little weeble-people job buddies give you hand signals to back up or dump  your load. And, in the audio, you can actually hear such sounds as backing-up  beeping and individual engine sounds (this feature is only as good as the tiny Game Boy sound processor can punch out, but it's still impressive to hear big diesel trucks sound deeper than the whining gas-engine farm threshers).    This is a little kid's game. It's no Chip's Challenge or Blast Corps. It's not challenging, it's not terribly exciting, and it doesn't have a purpose beyond the trucks. Still, there's no denying the title's charm. Take, for instance, the section of the game where gamers are hammering out a pit in a neighborhood zone -- once you are done, the pit is filled in as a pool and the little construction buddy dives in for a swim. If the game had been full of those little moments (or had a two-player co-op game), it would have brought the score much higher. As it is, it's only an average, simple toy, yet one that I still recommend for young truck lovers.", "date": "Feb 4, 2000"}
