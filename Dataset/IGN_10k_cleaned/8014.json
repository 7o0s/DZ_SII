Take the power into your own hands!~ So begins the story of Vigilante, immediately recognizable as a side-scrolling brawler from those two lines alone. Only the beat-'em-up genre can put things so concisely  someone important has been kidnapped, so go and kick the snot out of anyone who gets in your way as you walk to the right of the screen. Gaming purity, gotta love it.   It was the Irem Corporation that first created beat-'em-up games, doing so with the arcade title Kung Fu Master in 1984. That game Nintendo fans may remember, because it was ported to the NES as Kung Fu, one of the 18 8-bit launch titles for the Big N's first home console back in 1985. Kung Fu featured side-scrolling brawling in its simplest form  waves and waves of mindless baddies run at you from both sides of the screen, and you bash them out of the scene with a small arsenal of quick punching and kicking attacks.       Vigilante is very similar. Though not officially a sequel to Kung Fu, it was also made by Irem and used the gameplay engine of the previous arcade and NES hit as a starting point. Vigilante came to arcades in 1988, then was ported to the TurboGrafx-16 soon after. This Virtual Console version is an emulation of the Turbo edition.   Again, like Kung Fu, Vigilante offers simple and focused beat-'em-up gameplay. You walk to the right of the screen in a strict single dimension  there's no moving up or down on the Z-axis, like Double Dragon or Final Fight. No, it's simply a choice of left or right, and enemies attack from both. The baddies are still mostly mindless, the least powerful of them coming in swarms of clones and being easily defeated with a single kick or punch. The most powerful, though, may have you headed quickly to the Game Over screen  the end-level bosses have full life meters, and it takes a lot of skill and patience to chip away at their health, bit by bit.   Irem counterbalanced the challenge factor of the boss enemies by offering players a slightly more robust repertoire of attack commands. You can punch, kick and jump, just like in Kung Fu, but new to Vigilante is the ability to wield weapons. Well, weapon. There's one obtainable item, a pair of nunchucks, to be found and picked up off the ground  using it extends your attack range, but the added power is easily lost if you take a hard hit.  Vigilante is a great representative of old-school brawling, just one step beyond the very origins of the genre. Its gameplay is marked by simplicity and unforgiving challenge  prepare to be frustrated by the resiliency of some of this game's boss enemies. But games of this ilk always had something extra, a quality of addiction that kept you coming back again and again, even though you know you're just getting your butt kicked. If that sounds like your kind of pain-loving personality, cash in 600 Points and get moving  Madonna isn't going to save herself from those Skinheads", "date": "Feb 7, 2007"}
