They're not exactly my game of choice either, but since I'm IGN PC's official whipping boy, the duty of evaluating Wrebbit's latest CD-ROM adaption of the popular Puzz 3D series fell upon my shoulders.  Sigh.  Dubbed The Orient Express and subtitled ~from the Twenties~ so you won't confuse it with that Asian fast food joint down the street, this product is part jigsaw puzzle, part Myst style adventure.  And if that's not enough to scare you away from moving further into this article, oh intrepid reader, then you're a better gamer than I.    Still with me?  Then more's the fool you, because The Orient Express represents the worst of both worlds.  Thanks to an interface that sports more buttons than the suspenders of the latest crop of management trainees at TGI Fridays, you're best off introducing yourself to this beast by way of the tutorial.  Guided by a series of still pictures with instructions written upon them, you'll take the first tentative steps towards making sense of the game's point and click driven system of organizing pieces, placing them together, and plopping them into their rightful place in the 3D representation of the puzzle.  Sorting trays, picture mock-ups, table view selectors and various other useful tools can be accessed from any screen and will aid you along the way.  Even so, sifting through the various toolbars and table views can be a chore, but thankfully by the time you've completed the first, basic puzzle, the controls should come naturally.  This means you can find the 'Quit' key all the sooner...can I get a ~hallelujah?~   Once you're ready to enter the game itself, you'll be prompted to choose from one of four difficulty levels.  The setting you choose determines the number of pieces in the puzzle you'll then have to complete, its overall complexity, and the areas of the train which can be accessed after you've surmounted the challenge.  After bypassing the formalities, you'll be confronted by a cute actress dressed up like a fortune teller, who mumbles something about mah-jongg tiles, destiny, and trains in a half-hearted attempt at a European accent.  While a little T&A always spices up a CD, I'm still mystified as to what the hell Madam Babushka and her Chinese tiles are doing in a game about the Orient Express.  Oh well, at least she's easy on the eyes.   Whisked away into the magical world of jigsaw land, you'll attempt to piece together the cars which make up the train.  Gameplay boils down to searching the table for the scraps you need to recreate each model, placing them into one easily accessed location, and reassembling them into a workable whole.  Sound bytes will clue you in when you've found a pair of pieces that fit together or have somehow managed to assemble an entire section.  To add insult to injury, however, it's at the height of your ecstacy after finding the two pieces out of ten million that actually match up that the game decides to hit you with a low blow.  What's this I see here on the message window...educational audio and movie clips?! Son of a b*@!#, didn't someone tell these guys that games are meant to kill brain cells, not stimulate their growth?   Fear not though, for salvation is at hand.  As soon as you've suffered through a puzzle, you're given a ticket to board the train and experience an adventure filled with the same inane gameplay that inspired an entire four years' worth of Myst clones!  Plodding through the cars using an entirely linear progression system delivered in 'stunning' QuickTime quality, you'll get a sweeping view of washrooms and sleeping compartments.  Wouldn't you know it, there's a few puzzles to solve along your journey too, ranging from slider based conundrums centered around piecing together a jazz tune to word games that require you to determine which letters fit into a certain sequence within a predetermined number of tries.  You'll also get to interact with several passengers who'll further the story along, provided you're still awake at this point to listen to their ramblings.   Complementing the monotonous gameplay are drab visuals, low quality audio clips, and video footage that looks it was shot on a shoestring budget.  Puzzle pieces are supposedly 3D objects, but all you'll ever see of them are low resolution 2D images that use shading to portray the illusion of depth.  While several camera views provide you with as broad or close up a view of the action as you'd like, the game looks and feels unpolished.  Even the 3D rendered objects are so unrefined as to call to mind thoughts of those budget priced adventures Dreamcatcher, Head Games, and H+A used to shovel out.  I can't help but wonder if Wrebbit is still using the same engine for The Orient Express that was featured in '97 on the original Puzz 3D: Notre Dame Cathedral.   Ultimately, despite its ridiculous attempt to make use of adventure game elements, The Orient Express is the most detailed rendition of a jigsaw puzzle that you'll find on the PC.  To be honest, it lacks the broad selection of puzzles found in most of its bargain bin competitors.  Puzz 3D: TOE puts them to shame nonetheless by taking things into the 3rd dimension and offering a highly customizable gaming experience.  But due to an awkward interface, crap graphics, a deluge of historical data, and downright terrible acting, you'd be hard pressed to pick up on this fact.  Provided Wrebbit does themselves a favor and dresses their next title up a bit better, they might just salvage a decent game out of the Puzz 3D series yet.  For the moment, however, this train's one step short of derailing.  -- Scott Steinberg", "date": "May 11, 2000"}
