Then the credits started rolling, as I had apparently beaten the game.  On my very first play through.  Such is Balloon Pop: a puzzle game that rips off many previous titles but forgot to borrow some challenge.   The Balloon Bandit has abducted the Earth's seasons and enclosed them in his diabolic balloons.  It is up to you, a dancing mushroom, to release them and restore life on our planet.   That's all well and good, as puzzle games have never required a coherent explanation as to why we are matching gems or dropping blocks.  Balloon Pop is a match-three game where chains of same-colored balloons can be connected vertically or horizontally.  Once a group has been made time will stop, allowing you a few seconds to add to it or create new ones.  Once the grace period is over the chains will pop and new balloons will fall into place.   You play as a dancing mushroom who must release the trapped seasons from evil balloons.  Make sense? Where the game stumbles is in its difficulty.  It's not so much a difficulty curve as it is a straight line that starts at ~easy~ and ends at ~easy.~  The playing field does slowly expand as you work your way through Story Mode, adding new colors and more columns to work with.  But the speed never increases, so you'll find yourself coasting through level after level after level, wondering if the madness will ever end.   There is also a Puzzle Mode with over 200 stages to be cleared, but you have to work your way into the upper echelons of levels to find a decent challenge.  Head-to-head multiplayer is available either against a friend or the computer, but it's nothing more than your typical versus puzzle mode where you send objects to your opponent's screen by creating combos.   Along with the lack of difficulty, the game's controls provide another obstacle to fun.  You can play with the controller either held like a remote or in the horizontal position, but both are awkward.  The pointer is used to target balloons and you flick your wrist in the direction you'd like to move them.  But it's hard to make selections in a speedy manner this way.  When the controller is held horizontally you hold the 2 button to select a balloon, then press the D-pad in the direction to want to go, then release the 2 button while holding down the D-pad.  Fluid controls are very important for puzzle games so we can quickly maneuver across the playing field and set up combos.  Playing Balloon Pop is like fumbling with an actual balloon, trying to tie off the end.   Balloon Pop's visuals are on par with some of the better looking free Flash games out there.  The graphics are pleasant enough, but rather generic.  I do like how as you play through story mode life slowly starts to return to Earth.  As you pop balloons grass will grow, trees will sprout, and little creatures will join your dancing mushroom.  The music is also passable -- nothing special, but lighthearted and playful.As far as Wii shovelware goes, you could certainly do worse than Balloon Pop (I'm looking at you, Monster Trux Arenas).  It isn't hard on the eyes or ears, but it lacks any sort of challenge (apart from wrestling with the controls).  I could see very young gamers getting some fun out of it, maybe if they've never played a puzzle game before.  But for most of us, there are deeper, more inventive puzzle games available all over the place for cheaper or for free.", "date": "Mar 4, 2008"}
