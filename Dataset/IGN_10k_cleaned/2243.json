It's a point-to-point racing game in which the player gets the chance to drive a variety of exotic and not-so-exotic sports cars on five different courses set in different parts of the world.  TD4's garage is definitely an eclectic one. From the modern age there's a Dodge Viper (mmmmm: Viper), the gorgeous TVR Cerbera from Britain (sadly looking not-so-gorgeous in the game, however), a '95 Nissan 300ZX (bor-ring), the new Chevy Corvette (medallion and chest wig not included), and Jaguar's incredible XJ220 (ooooh yeah!). A selection of classic American cars is also available -- there's a '66 Shelby Cobra, '69 Chevy Camaro ZL-1, '69 'Vette, '70 Chevy Chevelle SS, and a '71 Plymouth Hemi Cuda SS for Midwestern PSX players who haven't picked up a car magazine in years. All are nicely rendered (apart from the Cerbera) and are clearly recognizable -- something that Need For Speed 2 didn't do particularly well. The only thing I didn't like about the cars is that during the game they look like they're floating above the road and not touching the ground at all.  The tracks are varied. Set in England, San Francisco, Switzerland, Japan, and Washington DC, all are very well drawn and faithfully capture the essence of the locations upon which they're based. Each can be tackled one at a time, or sequentially in one of four different Championship modes. Adding extra variety are a link mode, a duel option, and a drag strip to cane the cars to the max.  Sound is of reasonable quality. The title music is a great Orbital track, but the in-game techno music (surprise! surprise!) is generally poor. The sound effects suit the action, though.  All pretty good so far, but what about the gameplay? Well, that's where disappointment rears its ugly head in the form of the car's handling. It's not dreadful, but it's not brilliant either. The problem is that the controls are way too light and over-sensitive (particularly with an analog controller), so the car feels like it has no weight at all. Also, the car's weight-shift response is not fluid, so there's no feeling of feedback -- once you lose control, it's very difficult to avoid spinning out. I didn't feel like I had enough control -- particularly in my preferred first-person view. Third person is a little better because you can see what the car is doing, but it's still frustrating. Bottom line -- when you do something stupid in a game, it should be the player's fault. In TD4, sometimes it feels like it's the control's fault, and that is very annoying.  It's a shame. Everything else in the game -- graphics, sounds, gameplay options, the cars and AI (the enemy cars race like lunatics, which makes the game very challenging) -- point toward this being a great racer. But sadly, the flawed handling takes the edge off the enjoyment and as a result it's good, but not great. Had Test Drive 4 been more polished and better refined in the handling department, it would have been close to getting a 9. As it stands, it misses out on an 8 by a whisker.
