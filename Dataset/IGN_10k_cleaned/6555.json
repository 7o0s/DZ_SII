If you've played the Wild ARMs remake Alter: Code F (or any other game in the series, for that matter), then XSEED's first official release, Wild ARMs 4 may seem like it's part of an entirely different series. The art style, the gameplay mechanics, and most obviously, the battle system are all big departures from the mythos of previous titles. Luckily, it's not quite the jumbled collection of ideas that a lot of ~drastically different sequels~ usually are -- it's actually pretty pleasant. That's the good news. The bad news is that it doesn't exactly set the bar for RPG action or storytelling.   And what about that storyline? Best described as a modern-day ~Sun Tribe~ without the immorality, Wild ARMs 4 has a very distinct anti-adult theme (It's ~Kids~ vs. the ~Grown-ups~ for most of the adventure). Following the exploits of a small pack of adolescent friends determined to stop a coalition of Congressional Knights, Wild ARMs 4 is an interesting anomaly. One the one hand, its characters are somewhat engaging (main character Jude Maverick and his cohorts are predictable but likeable) and each of them has a few cool individual moments throughout the 40-hour adventure. On the other hand, the linear plotline itself uses themes and story arcs that we've seen dozens of times before -- and that means that the narrative is predictable and slightly disjointed. Though I must admit, I do have a weakness for stories that don't take themselves too seriously, and Wild ARMs 4 has a nice bit of self-deprecating humor to it. That's a plus in my book.   The characters of Wild ARMs 4 certainly have some appealing... things. Another one of the game's admirable qualities is its art style. Though its theme isn't any different than the prior titles (think ~classic fantasy meets Old West~), its approach to the subject matter isn't as familiar. This time around, for example, there's a dash of cyberpunk influence and a 70s-style cutscene technique used to move the story along. The character designs are substantially more complicated too, with lots of bells, buckles, blasters, and buttoned things covering up just about everything that breathes. If Rob Liefield decided to move into the world of manga, his work would probably look a lot like what's in Wild ARMs 4 -- only without feet.   Surprisingly, the game's artistic style actually compliments the storyline very well and saves it a bit in the end. Thanks to its strong visual design, every predictable moment in Wild ARMs 4 is made better or more interesting because of a well-imagined cast of characters and environments. Big thanks for this goes out to the graphics guys too, as 4th Detonator (as it's known in Japan) is certainly the best looking game that the series has seen so far. Even without progressive scan or widescreen support, there's a nice range of differing locales, believable facial expressions, and a solid framerate. The only real problems here are with the enemies (they're nothing too imaginative) and the number of characters onscreen at one time (the world is pretty barren). Still, the visuals are definitely impressive.   Platforming has finally come to the RPG genre. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Wild ARMs 4 (aside from its battle system, but more on that later) is its attempt at puzzle expansion. In last year's Alter: Code F, regularly solving brainteasers in-between battles was par for the course. 4th Detonator, on the other hand, adds several new actions to its puzzle-based tool system -- with 2D-style platforming being the most prominent new inclusion on the list.     You read that right -- there's platforming in Wild ARMs 4... And I'm not just talking about the occasional jump here or there either; there are several sections of the game that require you to traverse boxes, hop onto ledges, and explore your way through a whole mess of areas that have become synonymous with console adventuring. Players can slide, duck, perform double jumps, and stomp things below them too -- and it's surprisingly fun to get caught up in it.   To be honest, the exploration of the world of Filgaia is definitely its most appealing challenge. Most of the jumping puzzles and dungeons are well thought out, are fun to play, and aren't anywhere near as frustrating as those from previous titles. It wouldn't be stretching the truth to say that Wild ARMs 4 has been dumbed down a bit to appeal to the masses, but it seems to work out just fine (save for a few choice areas that may cause you scratch your head a couple of times). Tools are back too, but now in a much different way than before. This time the tool system is area-specific with puzzle solutions dependant on location-native items (ie, you use what you find laying around, not what's in your inventory). Expect to see bombs, swords, and an assortment of others goodies along the way.   Would acceleration be wise to use here? Surprisingly, the elements I've mentioned above aren't the only reasons the exploration in Wild ARMs 4 is so fun to participate in. There's also a neat little mechanic known as ~Accelerator~ that allows Jude to increase his speed and slow everything around him. When activated, Jude can pick up hidden bonus items, complete time-sensitive puzzles, and do other cool things he couldn't otherwise do. Players can also unlock the ability to turn random encounters on and off by ~breaking~ special locked save points found scattered throughout the game and capture some hard to find Gella. Nice!   But as much as I enjoy the originality shown with the new exploration system, I just can't get into the combat nearly as much. Broken into seven hexagons that have their own elemental properties known as HEX (Hyper Evolved X-Fire), the battle sequences are strongly reminiscent of strategy-RPGs. Players can move within one of the hexes at a time, perform an action, defend themselves, or do whatever else they want to do via an endless cycle of turns. The strategic element comes into play when it comes time to decide how and what to attack.   Say hello to the HEX system. It hates you. You can stack units in a single hex for a bonus (and so can your enemy), for example, but you're also more prone to damage. This is risk is because the actions performed within your grid affect every unit within it. This forces you to think about what your next move will be several turns down the line for every character on the list. When you couple that with a myriad of status-changing spells and a number of possible hex combinations, the potential for strategy is definitely pretty deep... but it doesn't always live up to it.    But why doesn't the combat meet expectations? There are several reasons really. First and foremost, there are very few battles that take much planning at all -- it's easy to decimate your opponents rather easily unless you somehow avoid battles until deep into the game. Confrontations are made even easier if you're a level-grinder (which, I am) and other than some bosses and a few choice enemies, it stays a breeze almost all the way through.   The above would actually be more forgivable if combat felt different from battle to battle, but the AI of your opponents never really varies much at all either. Straightforward physical attacks and the occasional damage spell are the bread and butter for most opponents, so it feels pretty repetitive ten or twelve hours into the game when you realize that enemy variety doesn't necessarily mean strategic variety,   The strategic potential is there, but do you need it? The combat isn't all disappointing, though. There are number of really cool personal skills that each character can learn that are not only fun to use but are pretty badass-looking as well. So while your opponents may not offer much in the long run, at least it's entertaining to try and take them out in different ways. The battle theme is pretty kickin' too, and is one of the standouts in a decent but not very powerful soundtrack.There have been a lot of ~Starter RPGs~ coming out in the last couple of months (re: role-playing games best suited for genre beginners), and Wild ARMs 4 is another one I'd add to the list. After all, the story is certainly not the greatest of the bunch and the combat is, for the most part, way too easy.But that statement sounds worse than how it actually relates to the gameplay. Developer Media Vision's cast of characters is overly likeable, the visuals are the best that the franchise has seen so far, and the puzzle-solving and exploration elements are really fun... it's just too bad that the potentially-awesome battle system wasn't hampered by bad enemy balancing and poor AI. Still, Wild ARMs is certainly a good 40-plus hour experience and a nice change of pace from your typical RPG fare.", "date": "Jan 13, 2006"}
