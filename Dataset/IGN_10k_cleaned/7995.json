Namco's Pool Pro Online II is just such an exception, as it offers a good pool game, but ups the value of the package by providing a very easy-to-use online component.   Pool Pro Online II offers just two variations on the game -- 8-ball and 9-ball -- but it really nails the presentation, geometry, and ease of use that I didn't mind the exclusion of other table games. The mechanics of these two games are incredibly well done. The basics you would expect from mobile pool are present, such the ability to spot check the angle of your shot and a useful pool cue meter for measuring the power of your shot. Sure, these are the fundamentals, but if a mobile pool game cannot even get control and functionality right, there's just no reason to go even further.   You can play quick, single-player games against a computer controlled player to get acquainted with the essentials. The computer is not a ferocious cheat, which makes for a pleasant single-player experience. When you first start out, nobody is pulling off miracle shots that serve only to dampen your game. The computer will make mistakes (sometimes even stupid mistakes) as you get into the game, which you need to pay attention to. Use these as cautionary tales for when you engage in the other half of the game: Online. However, don't count on such mercies as you dive deeper into the single-player stuff, trying out the AI pool sharks on the medium or hard settings.   Although the single-player stuff is solid, online is where Pool Pro Online II really takes off. When you first create an online account, you get to assemble a little avatar from a selection of pre-made heads, but change little things like hair color. Then you go head out to the lobbies to play either variation of pool against people across the country. You can jump into a quick game for fun, or get serious about your ranking and seek out opponents based on their experience or win ratios. There are tournaments you can enter for in-game prizes and items. You can also send messages to other players, issuing challenges and game invites.   One feature I especially like is that you can put players on a Block List if they disconnect right before losing. Nothing sucks more than a poor loser -- it just ruins a game. And with just the press of a button, you can make sure you never deal with that player again. Also very cool: Wagering your in-game cash on games. This is a great incentive to get people not to drop out since they forfeit their cash if they disconnect.   I really like the clean look of the game. Tested it on an LG VX8100, Pool Pro Online II was easy to use, thanks to smart visual cues, like the map of the ball when applying english or checking out the possible angles of a shot. The balls along the table show where you are in the 8- or 9-ball games. And the avatars make faces as you play, going from grins to grimaces when a shot goes sour.  Pool Pro Online II is a great pool game that I highly recommend to mobile gamers looking for a good pool sim. Gameloft's Midnight Pool has more personality than Pool Pro Online II, but the addition of the online mode (which does eat minutes on Verizon) really bumps up this game's overall value. If you're looking for a smart 8- or 9-ball sim to pass the time, Pool Pro Online II is an excellent place to start.", "date": "Feb 1, 2007"}
