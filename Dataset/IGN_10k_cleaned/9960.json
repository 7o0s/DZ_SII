On he doesn't in more places than just prime time television. 24: Special Ops is his third mission to neutralize a terrorist threat on mobile. But this is Digital Chocolate's first take on the popular 24 franchise. Previous efforts from I-play focused on a meta experience, casting the gamer as a member of the team operating alongside CTU agents via their own cellphones. It was a compelling mechanic. Special Ops is a more traditional action game, based largely on Digital Chocolate's awesome Mafia Wars Yakuza. It's a wide departure from I-play cerebral take on 24, but it is still an exhilarating one.   24: Special Ops starts with trouble down at the docks in Los Angeles. Intelligence reveals a terrorist organization has smuggled three bombs into LA. Jack reports to the scene and immediately starts ventilating the bad guys. He can use his pistol to unleash devastating headshots, a machinegun to chew through crowds of thugs, sneak up to perform a melee kill, or grenades to splash enemies behind barriers. But I want to concentrate on the first weapon for a moment.   The headshot skill is very cool and one of the game's standout features -- it adds a very slight puzzle/strategy element to the game. To eliminate an enemy with a headshot, you must establish a line of sight and then hold down the fire button. A white ring around the target fills with red. When you release on a full red ring, Jack performs the one-hit kill. In early stages, you enjoy several easy opportunities to get those headshots. But as the scene gets hairier for Jack, you must weigh whether the added exposure to enemies is worth going for the one-hit kill. An added complication: Extra body armor, which substitutes for health in this game, grows rarer as you go. The extra three seconds it takes to execute a headshot is sometimes just enough to put Jack's armor dangerously close to the edge.   The majority of the game is spent pushing through area after area, full of crates, walls, exploding barrels and other obstacles. Taking cover behind these objects to avoid detection or to take cover from incoming fire is paramount. Each area represents an hour of the thrill-filled day. You must hunt down the terrorists and get to the exit so you can move on. The pacing is exceptional, there are hidden goodies to find, achievements to earn, and the difficulty ramps up nicely, allowing you to get the hang of the controls in this isometric actioner. There are also a number of boss battles, such as a fight against a helicopter gunship, that are exceptionally well done.   In addition to the action scenes, Jack must also drive down busy highways, avoiding traffic. These scenes always start out simple, but as traffic snarls and bunches up, you have to use the brakes the create opening between passing semis and commuter cars. There are puzzle sequences, too, where you must decipher coded messages, pick locks and diffuse bombs.   Since 24: Special ops is based on Yakuza, the game looks predictably fantastic. The environments are expertly designed and detailed. Portraits featuring the actors, such as Keifer Sutherland, appear throughout the game to add authenticity. DChoc is exceedingly skilled in this area, so it is no surprise that the high-end versions of 24: Special Ops look and play so well.   Wait a sec -- the high-end versions?   Yes, it is incredibly important for me to point out that there are multiple versions of 24: Special Ops on the decks. I have played the game now on three different handsets: Sony Ericsson w810i, Sony Ericsson 900, and a Motorola RAZR V9. The V9 version looks pretty good, but it is definitely a different animal. Instead of a big adventure at the docks, Jack starts out at CTU and must clear out floor after floor of terrorists and rescue hostages. The basic mechanics are the same, such as the headshots and using cover, but it's not nearly as exciting as the higher-end version. So, this review is grading the higher-end version -- but make sure you know what you are getting on your phone. And if you are not pleased with the game after you download it, contact your carrier and request a refund. Trust me, I've done it on a few occasions myself and have never had an argument.  24: Special Ops is a great action game for mobile. The pacing is excellent, switching between well=paced action scenes and clever puzzle elements. If you have a higher-end handset, I highly recommend the game whether or not you even like the television series. This would be a gfun action game even if it starred Bert and Ernie.Hold on, lemme just jot that idea down...", "date": "Feb 5, 2008"}
