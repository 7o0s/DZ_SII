As big fans of EA's rugby franchise, EA's best rugby effort since relaunching the franchise in 2000, there was a silent air of anticipation in the IGN offices ahead of the arrival of Rugby 08. When the disk arrived, the silence was filled with the thumping slap of man-flesh on man-flesh and then we started playing the game.    Rugby 08 isn't a total overhaul of the series - instead it's a solid refinement and polish job of 06, with improvements in critical areas, some new features and the inclusion of the exclusive Rugby World Cup 2007 license. EA has managed to find the fine balance between ease of play for the novice, yet it retains enough challenge for the expert. With the official Rugby World Cup 2007 license, all major international, provincial and club tournaments and the new World Cup challenge mode, this game has everything the sports gamer is looking for irrespective of whether you are a rugby fan or not.      Rugby can be a mind-bogglingly confusing sport. Yet EA has managed to make some of the more complicated idiosyncrasies of rugby, like lineouts and scrums, a much more intuitive process. With advanced difficulty settings and new advanced lineout and simulation offload settings there is still plenty challenge for the experienced scrummer once you've mastered the basics. The interactive tutorial is informative and useful, however it would have been even better if had taught us how to use the advanced lineout settings.   One of the biggest issues we had with the last version of Rugby was the difficulty in controlling scrums and lineouts, particularly when we were learning how to play the game. In novice mode, lineouts are a simple single button push, helping you restart play and get moving again. However on the advanced lineout setting we just couldn't work out how to make our lineouts work - having said that, we didn't have an instruction manual supplied to us with the review copy of the game, so hopefully it's explained in there. The scrums are a big improvement over 2006, with enhanced push and rotation controls, enabling you to wheel your scrum to your advantage or to counter an opposition's wheel or drive.   Given that Rugby World Cup 2007 starts in early September we started to manage and play our own way through the tournament as the Wallabies. Managing the selections for the starting team for each game was quite the challenge, as players' form drops if they don't get game time. Trying to increase the squad's morale is also tricky - unfortunately there's no option to take the boys out to the Moulin Rouge in Paris for a bonding session! By the time of the quarter finals the trick is to have a squad of thirty players who are all in form with high morale. If you just pick the same team for each game and then suffer an injury to a key player, the replacement is going to let the team down.     EA trumpet ~Authentic Defensive Formations~ in Rugby 2008, however we aren't quite sure how these differ from Rugby 2006 and 2005's defensive patterns. There's a minor difference in that the defensive pattern doesn't need to be reset each ruck like it did in the 2006 instalment, but that's all we could see. Unfortunately there is no rush defence option, which is used now by a few of the top international teams, particularly South Africa. What is more noticeable this season is that when playing against the CPU it tends to attack based on the defensive pattern you've employed. For example, if you defend across the width of the field the CPU is likely to attack you close in to the ruck. Whilst on the topic of defence, the CPU defensive AI noticeably lifts when you're close to scoring against it. You can't always just pick up at the back of a ruck and drive over from close quarters for a try any more as the CPU smashes you backwards. This requires you to be a little more creative in how you score in the ~red zone~.   The improvements in AI aren't limited to defence close to the line and reacting to your defensive patterns. The AI in general has been improved, being much more inventive and less predictable that before, which adds volumes to the longevity of the game. We're not sure how accurate EA's claim that ~authentic offence~ as been implemented in Rugby 2008; it's doubtful the Wallabies and All Blacks haven't been sharing their playbooks with the developers. However, the set plays are a good start for gamers to understand and easy enough to implement on the fly.     Unfortunately our big gripe from 2006 still remains - when in drop goal distance the CPU seems to always have a shot at the three points. This may be Johnny Wilkinson's favourite tactic but in the world of professional rugby the drop goal tends only to be a deadlock breaker - as the Wallabies found out courtesy of Francois Steyn's boot in South Africa this year.   The inclusion of the World Cup Challenge Mode adds another element to the longevity of Rugby 2008. It's a nice little challenge game within the game, with key objectives to be achieved before the next challenge can be unlocked. Jonah Lomu Rugby on PS1 had a similar feature, but it wasn't close to the depth seen here. It's a fun inclusion, but could have been better if it used the original player names and kit designs for each of the classic moments rather than modern day teams.    If you're a sucker for punishment, you'll love the elite level difficulty setting, which seems much harder than in previous versions (in Rugby 2006 even the elite level became easy to overcome, but not this year) and the timing of the kicking meter is different making it harder to anticipate the perfect strike at goal. Also, unlike previous versions it is difficult to be caught offside this season unless you actually push your player into offside territory - this really removes a lot of frustration for the novice and for the gamer who isn't 100% au fete with the rules of rugby (which is most of us).    The graphics are very similar to the last game, with the biggest improvement being the stadium models. The stadium lighting effects in particular are noticeably superior to Rugby 2006. The sound production quality is as good as any of the EA SPORTS titles, which is high praise indeed, although the commentary doesn't seem to have changed drastically since Rugby 2006.     The ~Tournament Central~ page when playing the Rugby World Cup 2007, Super 14, Tri-Nations and other leagues is a nice addition, presenting all the bits and pieces required to track your progress through each campaign. Camera angles have been given an overhaul, with customisable camera angles and a nice tight zoom on the rucks and scrums. In short, whilst not many overarching changes have been made in the areas of graphics, sound and presentation, overall it's definitely a more polished, presentable game than the last.   While there's a whole lot to love about the new game, we've got a couple of issues. AI could kick less drop goals - this is quite unrealistic in the world of rugby as a first option - they are usually only used, at least in the southern hemisphere, as a way of sealing a game, not a primary scoring mechanism.   Some of the player stats aren't quite realistic. If Stirling Mortlock isn't a star then we're not playing! His goal kicking, which has been flawless for the Wallabies and the Brumbies over the last two seasons, isn't reflected in his kicking rating.   We're still frustrated by not being able to pass just before being tackled sometimes - you really have to get your timing right to pass otherwise you get tackled in the process. We recommend not using the simulation setting for offloads if you want a free flowing game.Rugby 08 is an improvement on its predecessor in every regard, although it's not the quantum leap that Rugby 06 was. The improvements in the control of the lineouts (at the novice setting) and scrums are small changes but definitely improve the overall experience. Mix all this in with EA's excellent production values and improvements in AI, and we're left with a quality sports title that will satisfy both the flag-waving rugby fan and the casual sports gamer. All we can ask for is a PS3 and Xbox 360 version with online play next season, and for the All Blacks to choke at the world cup again!", "date": "Jul 27, 2007"}
