First in the arcade, then on my Xbox, next on my Wii, and most recently on Xbox Live Arcade. You'd think by now I'd be sick of SNK Playmore's side-scrolling shooter. What keeps me going? ~Rocket lawn-cher!~ This short declaration of your acquisition of one of the weapons in Metal Slug 3 never fails to put a smile on my face.   Like the rest in the famed arcade series, Metal Slug 3 is a difficult game. It was designed to munch quarters by killing your character early and often. Were it not for the little joys of attaining a rocket ~lawn-cher~ or being turned into a blood-spurting zombie, I might just give up halfway through Metal Slug 3. If you get frustrated having your ass kicked, Metal Slug may turn you off. But if you want a good ol' fashioned 2D shooter, this should do the trick.   Choosing from one of four different characters, players lay siege to five diverse and challenging levels. You'll trek across the desert, trudge through the jungle, swim the deep blue sea, soar through the skies and even blast off into outer space. The controls are simple -- radial aim with the left thumbstick, shoot with X, jump with A, lob grenades with Y -- but the game is tough. There's a myriad of enemies on screen at all times, firing from a variety of weapons. You'll need to move and dodge deftly and fire accurately if you hope to survive. Making it through a level unscathed is a feat accomplished by a rare few. Fortunately, you can turn on a Free Play option to allow unlimited continues.    Metal Slug stands out from some of the other coin-op side-scrollers thanks to some inventive character design. Though the visuals aren't much better than when Metal Slug 3 was brought to the original Xbox, it remains a colorful game with some humorous animations and enjoyable enemies. It's the fifth and final stage that really shows off what has made the series a fan-favorite. This sprawling level features a plethora of unique enemies and locales and even something that amounts to a plot twist.    Halo 3 has just been served. You may be wondering why Metal Slug 3 (the fourth in the series) was chosen to be first Slug title brought to Xbox Live Arcade. MS3 is the most significant entry in the series. This is the first Metal Slug to offer branching paths and zombies that can turn the player into one of the undead. It also happens to be the best Metal Slug to date.   Metal Slug 3 isn't the perfect translation from the arcade. There are some nagging issues with aiming. At times it can be a challenge to aim with precision (say, point your gun at 2 o'clock while moving in a different direction). This is particularly an issue when you first hop into some of the slugs (AKA vehicles). And though the horrible framerate issues that plague the arcade version are mostly gone on 360, there are still a few times when things chug. This is especially true online. When things get hectic over Xbox Live, the framerate takes some major hits.   None of this is likely to earn as many complaints as the censorship of Metal Slug 3 on XBLA. Gone is the copious amount of red blood, replaced with anonymous white goop. Oddly enough, if you change the language on your 360 to Japanese, the red blood magically appears. Also gone from the original Xbox version are the two bonus modes Fat Island and Storming the Mother Ship.    You can, however, play with a buddy on Xbox Live this time around. While I ran into a few latency issues, it's hard to know if this is a problem with the game or a result of Xbox Live's current instability. The latency is intermittent and certainly annoying, but still not enough to keep me from having fun online.  Before you purchase Metal Slug 3, you need to ask yourself how much you value ten dollars. This is a short experience that, even with a few playthroughs, won't last you long. The exclusion of the two bonus modes from the original Xbox version is certainly a bummer and would have added a few more hours of playtime. Metal Slug 3 is a lot of fun, but this should be a $5 download. Especially when original, awesome-looking shooters such as Omega Five are storming Xbox Marketplace.", "date": "Jan 4, 2008"}
