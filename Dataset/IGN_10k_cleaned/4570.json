Early mobile pinballers like Space Taxi Pinball were absolutely awful. Lat year's Lord of the Rings Pinball? Not so kingly. But Sorrent bucked the trend last month with their fun Ren & Stimpy Pinball -- and now Blue Lava Wireless and developer Vanguard are hoping to keep the ball rolling with Pinball Dragon.  Features:  Physics model developed in Japan Full-color board  Pinball Dragon is actually a very well done pinball game. Blue Lava wasn't blowing smoke when it boasted on the company website that ~clever programmers in Japan have found a way to move the ball through the most realistic pinball machine on your mobile.~ The physic engine powering Pinball Dragon is quite effective. Dare we say, better than Ren & Stimpy Pinball? We dare say it.  However, unlike Ren, Pinball Dragon only has a single board. But the board is full of all the bells and whistles you expect to find on a pinball table -- bumpers, buzzers, ramps, flippers, etc.  Pinball Dragon also has a variety of special events, triggered by nailing the right bumpers. Rings and shields appear in the center of the screen, and if you manage to hit the object three times, you can unlock special modes like multi-ball.  Vanguard did a very, very nice job designing the dragon-themed table. We especially appreciated the isometric view, since few people actually play pinball standing directly over the glass. It certainly lends the game a certain sense of realism -- even if the screen is only 1/100th the size of an actual pinball machine.  Unfortunately, unlike the best pinball machines, Pinball Dragon is pretty quiet. On the Sanyo 8100 we tested the game on, we heard only a smattering of sound effects -- no music themes. We certainly would have enjoyed a little more aural razzle-dazzle. Blue Lava Wireless scores again with the acquisition of Pinball Dragon from developer Vanugard. This is a solid effort, and we would love to see Vanguard take on more pinball games in future -- hopefully adding more boards and sounds. Will the original pinball wizard Elton John be crooning about Pinball Dragon any time soon? No. But we just may.", "date": "Mar 20, 2004"}
