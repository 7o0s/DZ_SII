{"name": "The Weakest Link", "name_review": "The Weakest Link", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/10/28/the-weakest-link", "text": "by iPlay is a simple mobile edition of the once-popular televised game show here in the States (it has enjoyed more success overseas) that simplifies the show's formula so much I cannot imagine even the most ardent fans being that amused or taken with the game.   The majority of the show's appeal came from its lightning pace and the acerbic wit of its host. Neither are present in this mobile game. There are occasional comments and quips when you blow a game, such as ~You're the bad apple in my barrel.~ No, The Weakest Link, you are.   The game also eschews the other players. Instead of voting out players, you vote out a category of queries at the end of each successful round. Categories include entertainment, geography, history, and general -- and after you choose a category to jettison, The Weakest Link lets you know which category was your best or worst played.   The rest of the game follows the basics of the show. You answers a series of questions -- each correct answer moves you up to a higher value question. You try to raise the stakes as much as possible by answering the questions correctly. You can ~bank~ that money you earned at any time, but then the next question is worth the lowest amount possible for that round. Get a question wrong and you lose any money that has not yet been banked.   The Weakest Link sports some very base-level presentation. The text is certainly legible, which is always a plus in trivia-style games, but the rest of the affair offers very little for visual stimulation.The Weakest Link comes a few years too late and in a very stunted form that manages to replicate little of what made the show once enjoyable.
