But now Warriors Orochi has found itself on Sony's portable system and PSP owners might be wondering how the game has made the transition. Despite the fact that I wasn't hugely fond of the game in its console iterations, I must admit that playing Warriors Orochi on the PSP seems fitting and the amount of content on the UMD -- repetitive content though it may be -- is pretty impressive.   Warriors Orochi revolves around the idea that Orochi, the Serpent King, has used his vast powers to merge the Three Kingdoms era of China together with the Warring States period of Japan. These two historical times are, conveniently, the homes of Koei's well-known Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors franchises. So in the grand scheme of things, Warriors Orochi collects a huge number of characters from both series together in a big fight against Orochi and his demonic legions.    This title is very, very similar to the other Warriors games. Combat is all about guiding your characters through hundreds of enemy soldiers and officers and dispatching them with a handful of different types of attacks. Each warrior at your disposal has a Normal attack, Charge attack and Musou attack to take advantage of. The majority of the game will be spent pounding away with your Normal attack and ending combos with a Charge attack. Musou techniques, as you may expect, take out a large number of your foes but requires time to recharge.   The special addition to Warriors Orochi is the tag-team system, which lets you cycle between three different warriors at any time and create diversified teams to suit your tastes. Although there are no tag-team attacks (which I found extremely disappointing), you can chain together each character's Musou attack for added damage, which is a nice touch.   Ultimately though, this is a game you've played before. If you've spent even five minutes with a previous Warriors game, you'll be relatively familiar with the happenings in Warriors Orochi. This might not be a bad thing for some because a lot of gamers really love their hacking and slashing, but I would have preferred a more robust combat system.   Working up the food chain. But the PSP version does a number of things that I find quite commendable, including the fact that it's taking the entire console experience and putting it into portable form, with only a few minor sacrifices (the graphics have been toned down and cutscenes have been removed in favor of comic book style segments). While previous portable Warriors games segmented the battle environments to lessen the demands on the hardware, Warriors Orochi offers the full maps without any real alteration, which fans will certainly appreciate.   And if Warriors Orochi has just one thing going for it, it's the massive cast of characters -- a cast that can be leveled up and customized to ridiculous proportions.  The PSP version also runs fairly well, though pop-in and jerky animations are still commonplace. Ad hoc multiplayer is a welcome feature, though you'll definitely encounter more slowdown there than in the single-player experience.   In a way, I feel as though Warriors Orochi is more at home on the PSP. A portable environment seems infinitely more conducive to a button-mashing experience than a home console setup, if only for the fact that portable games shouldn't require as much focus and can pass the time with quick bursts of play. Obviously some gamers on the go prefer a immersive experience, but there will always be gamers that want to power up, kill a few hundred soldiers and then power off without thinking too hard.Warriors Orochi is just the same Warriors experience weve seen for years except in portable form. I enjoyed the tag-team dynamic, even if its more of a novelty than anything else. All the typical problems of repetition, poor story, below average graphics and awful voice acting return once again, but the renowned Warriors button-mashing seems more fitted to quick, portable gaming sessions. There are certainly better PSP games out there, but Warriors Orochi is a fine representation of the console experience and may even surpass its predecessors by existing within a more appropriate medium.", "date": "Mar 24, 2008"}
