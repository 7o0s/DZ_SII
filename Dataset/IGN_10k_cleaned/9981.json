Sure, the cynics among you might think that having to play a game that can be finished in a little over two hours (that's having played and hit the top score in every mode), all while being force-fed the same amphibian malady that drove the whole of Europe into the darkest depths of insanity has claimed the mind of yet another, but you just don't get it, man.   In actuality, Crazy Frog Arcade Racer (also known as Crazy Frog Racer 2, thanks title screen!) is exactly what you think it is: a racer that piggybacks off the baffling success (at least abroad) of one of the most annoying mash-ups of eurobeat backgrounds and, well, something that sounds like a guy doing an impression of an F1 car sped up a bit too much. A whopping 12 tracks, a dozen racers and the ~option~ of running through the former with the latter in Time Trial and Single Race Modes is really all that greets here. Well, unless you absolutely crave the frighteningly well done CG videos for two of the Crazy Frog ~songs.~   Don't... Or mini-games! Yes there are two delightfully simple options for those that just can't seem to rid themselves of their Crazy Frog addiction. Although, tapping all four face buttons in various one-, two- and three-button combinations to a bunch of Crazy Frog tunes or guiding a pinball around a course with billiards-style bumpers to hit a bunch of targets barely qualifies as a game... which, I suppose, is why they called it a mini-game.   There is no more perfect an example of what Crazy Frog Arcade Racer than the Chase Mode, where you continually race around a track -- not picking up any weapons or power-ups or anything, just racing endlessly -- over and over until the drones placed all over the course hit you enough to whittle your health down to nothing. Your reward? A tally of how far you went before the sweet, sweet embrace of video game death saves you from this nigh-eternal suffering. It is, like the rest of the game, something that you start up and give to a three year old to keep them happy for a few minutes.    Buy... What's really weird about the whole mess is that visually, the game is pretty damn impressive. It's not going to wow anyone beyond the whole, ~wait, this is what a Crazy Frog game looks like?!~ comment, but it's certainly a solid looking game. The limited animation on each of the characters is fluid and clean, and the models themselves are really rather detailed. The number one comment that people in the office had after finding out what game I was playing was a reserved, ~that actually looks... pretty good?~ Furthermore, the courses have all the color pop of classic Sonic levels, which just feels weird to type.    The track designs however, which twist and warp not unlike a rejected WipEout course (even the racers themselves sound like re-skinned WipEout hovercraft), never really gel enough to feel inspired, but the game regularly tries to play with elevation, throwing racers off huge jumps at least once per course.    There's a problem here, though: the same sense of momentum that lets a bunch of 'tude-sportin' racers go careening off-course at pre-set spots also affects some less-than-ideal corners. Enough speed plus enough of an incline in a track will nearly always mean a trip into the abyss below the tracks. Were the races terribly challenging, it would be a bigger issue, but instead it just feels like the designers didn't really care too much about the ramifications of building their own tracks.      Like all good kart racing clones, there are weapons aplenty, all of which neatly fall into the usual projectile/mine/shields categories. You've got your dumbfire missiles, your poison clouds and -- oddly enough -- two different shields: one that protects against normal weapons and another that apparently only works if you hit another player or they try to do the same, though I don't think normally it even causes damage, so it's really more of an offensive weapon. Should you need a repair, there are two options: little coins or a few gears smashed up that offer small and large resuscitation options. The coins, contrary to the instruction manual, don't give you power-ups -- those would be the little lightning bolt icons, which according to the manual are small shield repairs. There are a whopping nine pages to the manual counting the front and back covers, so it's easy to see how someone could make a mistake with so much to type up.    This... With no real side-to-side momentum for the racers (which are broken down into speed, accelerating, road holding and weight categories in values from one to six, yet none of them actually go beyond two, and there are no apparent upgrades), the ultra-twitchy controls make the game a spazzy exercise in caroming off walls unless you have one of the more agile racers. It really does feel like a game made for the Ritalin crowd.    You'll notice that I've steered away from even mentioning the sound for the most part. There's a good reason for it: I'm pretty sure that the half-dozen or so eurodance remixes of popular songs like ~Hey! Baby~ (the Bruce Channel 60s one) and ~Final Countdown~ are being used right now as the replacement for waterboarding at Gitmo. I like most electronic dance music -- even the cheesy synth stuff -- but even I had to kill the volume after a while. Everything else in the game seems plucked from standard sound libraries, though that doesn't mean they sound bad exactly, just very run-of-the-mill.   Game. Crazy Frog Arcade Racer is probably dangerous enough to be classified as a controlled substance, for it will surely drive anyone who plays it long enough into the throes of insanity, left holding 20 minute conversations with houseplants and trying to iron French toast ~just to get the wrinkles out.~ Despite not looking like the ocular abortion that one would expect, I still wouldn't even wish it upon my worst enemy. If you play it, you clearly hate yourself. And freedom. And puppies.", "date": "Feb 7, 2008"}
