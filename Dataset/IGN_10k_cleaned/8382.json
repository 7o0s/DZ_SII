Almost totally unseen today, there was a time when Nintendo used their names and likenesses liberally  attaching their status, popularity and reputation to a variety of titles. Kobe Bryant headlined NBA Courtside on the N64. Before that, Ken Griffey Jr. had hit a Winning Run on the Super. And even before that, on the NES, was Nintendo's first celebrity-endorsed sports title  Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!.   This game isn't that. This game is Punch-Out!! Featuring Mr. Dream, the altered version that removed Tyson's image and name after a contract dispute in the early '90s. The removal did little to harm the game, as Punch-Out!! was never really about Iron Mike at all. It was about the patterns.          Recognizing the patterns, timings and tells of each opponent is what it takes to win the championship in Punch-Out!!. You play as Little Mac, a diminutive upstart rookie in the boxing world who's faced with one of the most flashy and funny rogues' galleries of heavyweight opponents to every appear in any game. You'll stare across the squared circle at enemies like the overly effeminate Don Flamenco, the friend of the bottle Soda Popinski, the pectorally gifted Super Macho Man and, most famously, the excessively rotund King Hippo.   Boxing each of these mighty fighting men is a contest of perception and reflexes  each has some subtle hint that reveals his next action, each jab, hook and uppercut telegraphed in some way. The jewel on turban-clad Great Tiger's head-wrap will blink when he's about to bring the pain, meticulously mustached Von Kaiser will shake his head back and forth before his attack  many of the hints are obvious, but some of the signs are subtle.    You anticipate what's coming based on these tells, then dodge, block or preemptively strike to counterattack against them. Little Mac's a small guy, but he's got an impressive arsenal of moves for only having access to two controller face buttons. You can command him to dodge left or right, duck down quickly, shield his face with his gloves, and attack either high or low with either his left or right hand. The control is remarkably tight, preserving the challenge of the experience and letting you know that when you go down, it's your lack of skill that's made you hit the mat  no fault of the game.    Punch-Out!!'s strict level of challenge, its outstanding graphics and addictive ~just one more try~ style of gameplay made it a major hit in the NES days. It didn't need a celebrity sports star's name attached to it, because it stood solidly on its own merits  merits that merited a sequel on the Super NES a few years later. The Punch-Out!! series has since gone dark, which is a shame. But shades of its influence live on in such modern Nintendo titles as Wii Sports Boxing, and it wouldn't be a shock to someday see the Big N bring back the Little Mac.   Punch-Out!! has been one of the most wanted and requested Virtual Console titles since Day 1 of the Wii's launch last November. Now, with its arrival, it'll likely become a top seller for the NES VC line-up. And deservedly so. Punch-Out!! is more than worth its 500 Point asking price, and a high volume of digital sales for the title may make Nintendo take notice again of the forgotten franchise. The Wii seems perfectly suited for a revival of the series  or, at least, Little Mac could be added to the roster of playable fighters in the upcoming Super Smash Bros. Brawl. He's Nintendo's original fighting mascot, after all  the company's own celebrity sports star.", "date": "Apr 18, 2007"}
