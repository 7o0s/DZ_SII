{"name": "Parappa The Rapper 2", "name_review": "Parappa The Rapper 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/01/23/parappa-the-rapper-2", "text": "When Masaya Matsuura and Rodney Greenblatt were given the go-ahead with their first effort on PlayStation, Parappa the Rapper, the flimsy, 2D characters and happy-go-lucky rap music touched a warm fuzzy spot in just about everybody. People in the Imagine office (where I was working at the time) were playing the game over and over, singing Parappa songs, saying stuff like ~I gotta believe!~ and generally having a sweet little romance with the oddity that was Parappa the Rapper. Despite the game's simplistic gameplay mechanic, the music and the characters made Parappa undeniably charismatic.   After the relative commercial failure, and moderate critical reception, of Um Jammer Lammy, the not-quite sequel, the idea of creating another Parappa the Rapper seemed questionable. Yes, it's a fun game, and Parappa and his gang are certainly cool, but the novelty has slipped. The game concept hasn't changed, leaning neither toward an evolutionary or even a moderate change in the way gamers play music games. Perhaps that's SCEA's doing, because after all Vib Ribbon was certainly innovative, and SCEA refused to publish in the US. Now we have Parappa the Rapper 2, a clear and simple sequel, with few frills, and by no means a step forward for the music genre. So, is it worth the cash?   If you like music games, be they short, silly, or kiddy, and you love Parappa, then yes, you should. But if you want anything more than a mere five-plus hour experience that betters Um Jammer Lammy and takes the genre inches forward from the first game, then you shouldn't.   Gameplay and Everything Else See, Parappa the Rapper, or any music game for that matter, is about music. I liked the first Parappa the Rapper better than Um Jammer Lammy because I liked the music better. Others disagree. Whatever. With this sequel, Masaya Matsuuru and his small team created a funny story, added in some extra characters to meet up with their old gang, and created all new songs to rap to. The songs fall into similar styles first heard on Parappa's first outing.   The first stage in the burger joint is a fast rapping song that feels like the first Chop Chop Master Onion song, but is sung with Beard Burger Master, while stage four is sung along with Moosesha, and it also feels much like the song from the first game (Mooselini's stage). It's no loss, for sure, in fact, they bring back that sunny, positive vibe that made Parappa so likeable. Those two songs from Parappa were some of my favorites, as well as jamming with Rastafarian Frog in the flea market.   Other songs bring a slightly different variation to Parappa's song palette. Stage 3 is a funny and wonderful area, in which Chop Chop Master Onion is the leader of a Romantic Karate TV show, and the song is slow and um, perhaps, meditative? It's low key to be certain, and though the level makes up in humor for what it lacks in the song itself, its not the high-energy Chop Chop song or songs we've once heard. Stage 5's Hairdresser Octopus is a Latin, slightly feminine male hairdresser whose song is fast and funny, adding off-beat raps that make the game slightly more difficult (but not much). Guru Ant's stage and song are also quite mellow, a little less hectic than say, Moosesha's army antics. Another nice little touch is that De La Soul and another outside band were part of the creation of at least two songs in the game.   All in all, the songs divvy up the soulful, positive music that made early morning TV shows such as the Jackson Five show and The Fat Albert Show such fun to watch and listen to back in the 1970s (when most of you weren't even conceived yet). The music in Parappa brings happy, good-time beats and positive messages into the mix, and even if it's rather light and perhaps even trite at times, the mood is sunny, warm, and cheerful despite its familiar charms.   The game comprises eight stages in all, providing players with an easy and a medium mode of difficulty, and it's pretty easy to beat in both easy and medium modes in less than a few hours. In fact, this game feels easier than Um Jammer Lammy or the original Parappa the Rapper.   The levels include stages:   1. Beard Burgers, a Burger Town Tradition 2. Strictly for Adults romantic karate, danger tick 3. Hey, Grab That Remote Control 4. We'll Turn you Into a Real Man 5. You Don't Want Her to Go Through This Yet 6. Parappa Papa's Pastime is Perfected 7. Noodles are the Flow, Noodles are the Groove! 8. Final Party   Additions to the game mode mix are several, with players given the standard story mode, which after its beaten, offers players a two-player challenge, called Battle mode, played either against the computer or another player. After beating a stage, players also can see their ranking, play again, or enter into Battle mode. The two-player mode is good fun, with or without a real person around. For those who are new to the game, a helpful and optional Practice level is presented before each stage, so players can get into the flow beforehand.   Another neat addition is the Bonus Stage. After a player achieves a score or more than 500 or 750 (we're not quite sure on this yet), they're given a chance to add more points to that score with a little mini-game. Parappa stands in between four little Chop Chop Onion minions who hold up blocks or boards for Parappa to hit, kick or chop. When they hold them up, players need to hit them by pressing the corresponding symbol on the controller; the trick is to hit them fast, and NOT to hit them when they don't hold up anything. The extra points are tacked onto the final score of the stage. It's a neat little bonus stage that has nothing really to do with music, but it's cheap fun.   For those who haven't ever played a Parappa game, it's quite kooky goodness. The game is a Simon Says-style game, in which a character presents a set of buttons to press in time with the beat of the music, and players are meant to press the corresponding buttons in time with the music, too. The game gauges your success with a ranking of Cool, Good, Bad, and Awful. Players can pass the level with a Good ranking, and get extra points for Cool. As with previous Parappa games, the music changes from the standard song to slow and funky variations of that song when players perform below the ranking of good. Players must restart the stage if they can't upgrade from Awful within a few beats.   The visuals are equally weird. Every character is a 2D sprite, thin as a playing card, and simplistic but sweet and likeable in character design. The whole game looks very much like a high-resolution rendition of the first Parappa PlayStation game. It's nothing wild or Earth shattering, but that's OK, the game is light-hearted fun, for one or two players.   The story is quite hilarious. Parappa's town is being taken over by a mysterious noodle infection. Everything turns into noodles, including the local burger joint! Now they serve noodle burgers! Yeccchhh. And since, Parappa already won a lifetime supply of noodles in a contest, he's got noodles on the brain. When Sunny Flower makes him dinner and it's all noodles, he insults her, and leaves the house. As with the first game, the crux of the plot is driven by his love for Sunny, who wants to win back by learning how to act mature. His quest leads him on an adventure in which he must learn the cause of the noodle infestation (which is all done by the evil Noodle Syndicate), and team up with his inventor father, a colonel in the army, and his former band members from Milk Can.   The characters include:  Colonel Noodle, Beard Burger Master's Son (new) Guru Ant (new) Hairdresser Octopus (new) Instructor Moosesha (new, and cousin to Mooselini) Sunny Flower PJ Berri Chop Chop Master Onion Um Jammer Lammy Parappa the Rapper Katy Kat The drummer creature MC King Kong Mushi Once I heard the music and saw the game again, I had to have Parappa the Rapper 2. It's not as hard as Um Jammer Lammy (which may be good for some folks), and it certainly covers familiar territory when it comes to the essentials -- gameplay, graphics, and sound -- but it's still fun and happy-making. For the cynics: I can't recommend this to graphic tarts, simply because it's literally comprised of 2D sprites and simplistic graphics, and I can't recommend this to fans who were expecting a major breakthrough in the series or the genre. Also, it's a short, short game. I haven't found anything more than earning new colored hats each time I beat it. For the fans: For those who truly love Simon Says-style music games and who love Parappa, his hilarious story and the upbeat music will have you cheering, laughing, and playing the game again and again. It's the kind of game you can play and beat in mere hours, but it's always great to have around when you get in the mood. My suggestion is to rent it first, and then if you must have it, then buy. It's a little hard to shell out $49.99 for such a short game.", "date": "Jan 23, 2002"}
