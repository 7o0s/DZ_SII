Where's the fun in that? Hell, I can turn left in my Civic. I don't really see the big deal in doing it in a car with advertisements plastered all over the front, aside from all the extra pretty colors of course. What makes them so special? I don't see the Mars Corporation paying my ass to paint my car with an M&M logo while I turn left. What's up with that?   I think a lot of people have that exact viewpoint on NASCAR racing, a sport that, while wildly popular across the United States, remains a love/hate, predominately hate relationship for a majority of people. Personally, I don't much care for watching televised NASCAR. Hundreds of laps and sickeningly ecstatic announcers start to bring me down (like the Spanish soccer of that world). But that doesn't mean the sport is any less legitimate, demanding, or enjoyable. Indeed, reality proves to be quite the contrary. And if you fancy yourself brave enough to play NASCAR 2002, you'll understand just that.  Without a doubt, NASCAR Racing 2002 Season is currently hands down the best PC NASCAR racing game around. From sound, to physics, to graphics, to control, to options, it's the complete racing simulator... Simulator.  Uh oh, now we have two things to potentially turn away the masses of casual to avid players around the world, who, though madly in love with gaming, perhaps don't want the complexities and overtly realistic play inherent with the simulation. Sims can be intimidating things, after all. But simulations of NASCAR? I can appreciate how that can be a downright terrifying prospect to many.   Allow me to set you at ease. You too can and should play and enjoy Papyrus's latest, even though it's a heck of a lot like Papyrus's last.  Don't be fooled by the simulation aspects of the title (control options, customizability, and a demand for interest in and knowledge of the sport), NASCAR 2002 is just as easy to pick up for the beginner as it is the pro. Certainly the more experienced will have the advantage, and the beginner may be daunted, but new options and allowances in the realm of realism are made with the intentions of catering to a wider audience (the word ~optional~ is of vital importance).  Turning left at 180MPH and keeping a cool line into the straight is tough in the purest simulation mode. Doing it with 42 other cars muscling in on you is downright crazy. That's why there are plenty of novice assists in place that act as training wheels.  Foremost are the expansive, and still disappointingly non-interactive tutorials and tours of the many tracks and nuances of NASCAR. It may sound like Kurt Loder is narrating the game's ten tutorials, but it is all NASCAR goodness, to the limit. Gameplay footage, visual indicators, and plenty of audio pull along what turns out to be descriptions on a ton of basics and more advanced intricacies to the game. Then comes Darrell Waltrip, famed racer, and his run through the 24 courses. Darrell talks a bit about each course and then offers advice on how to handle it. What sucks is that all this is a strictly look but don't touch affair. There's not a bit of interaction in the whole thing. As helpful as it is, the lack of any real hands-on is pretty sad. Mini-games like GT3's licenses or even Crazy Taxi's Crazy Box that are designed to improve your skill while keeping it fun are definite musts. A free test session that provides a colored overlay indicating a proper line through courses and how to take turns is in there (also available in actual races), but that hardly makes up for it.  Once you've come to grips with the beast, the actual game can also be played from a more novice/arcade way, or a strictly realistic simulation (as always). Damage, breaking, and steering assists exist to lighten the load, but wind up positively working for diehards as much as they can for beginners.   Managing your position among the 42 other cars is what it's all about. Weaving in and out between your hapless and soon to be dusty victims and using strategy and foresight to gauge when to floor it and when to hold it are paramount to success. But because doing this while navigating the many minor but altering differences of the tracks alone can be tough enough, enabling the steering assist alleviates the pain of getting around bends while fighting for position. This in turn allows for more attention to be diverted to drafting and position. Inching close behind those in front and making quick battles to the outside or inside requires a lot of nerve. Assists in steering let you concentrate on that without worrying about things like the wall exploding your car. Of course you also got difficulty, damage, and other twists to ease or harden things up as you see fit.  From Papyrus:  ~In an era in which the term realistic simulation is viewed with disdain by many in the gaming industry, you've proven that there IS a market for such products -- if they're done right.~  Amen to that, brother. Amen to that. If only more could see the light.  Regardless of what play style is chosen, investing in a quality steering wheel is practically a necessity with NASCAR 2002. Keyboards and joysticks are just not going to cut it anymore. Even though linearity adjustments that allow you to configure the responsiveness and way in which the car carries out your commands are provided for, the very precise and intensely tight nature of NASCAR prohibits the tried and true interfaces entirely. I even had problems with an analog gamepad because it simply did not have enough subtlety and precision to pull off the maneuvers I was attempting. Flowing from gas to brake and back again in very minor adjustments while trying to keep as best a draft as you can is critical to success, so it's important, that while you may be able to play with an analog stick on most gamepads, you have a means for very precise analog control for not only steering but also acceleration and deceleration.      All of the many gauges and indicators have to be looked after through the run of a course. Letting your tires go or your fuel deplete can spell disaster. Glancing down at all times is important, but the frantic nature can be slowed by pausing the game. Once paused you can still access any of the many indicators by way of the function keys. I'm using this small touch as proof of how much thought and effort has been placed into the game as a whole. It may not be the most realistic thing around, but if you need a little extra time to analyze all of the available information and figure out what the hell you want to do, this is it.  For the enthusiast, atop the new listen and learn tutorials comes the standard and overwhelming barrage of car configurables and customization options. If you like to tinker, you'll like NASCAR 2002. Opponent AI can be tweaked to preference (still a rather tiresome and tedious trial and error slider driven affair), and cars can be modified in so many different, minute, but still pertinent ways that it's scary. It's because of this that the initial non-interactive tutorial encourages players to simply leave the garage be until they arrive at the conclusion that it's not no longer limited skill preventing victory, but rather a limited machine. Sound advice.  As always, instantly replaying your run is a comprehensive breeze. In addition to the proven suite of camera and speed controls, 2002  also allows players to rudimentarily edit their saved replays by cutting them to wanted size and importing external media files for augmentation -- perfect for the taunting gloaters wanting to glorify their win and humiliate their foes with the additions of a few crying sounds and smiley face graphics.  Aurally, the experience starts out rather depressing. I'm not too fond of the Top Gun inspired ass rock that taints the menu system. Play (something the title is particularly good for) is thankfully a completely different story. NASCAR 4's audio effects were quite good, at the least. 2002's compilations of vrooms, dings, and dongs, on the other hand, are exceptional.   Because the game sounds and feels (yes that is an appropriate word) so true to the mark, it's almost unnoticeable at first (a canon special effects artists live by). The less people notice your work, the better it is, and the more you're succeeding at your job. But, going back to anything else, even for a moment, makes the care and meticulous approach that has been put into NASCAR 2002 immediately apparent and that much more appreciable.  Engine noises emanating out from within your hood and even those of your competitors differ depending on where you are in relation to them and from which of the four views you're playing from. More than this, the sound seems more believable, more intricate. As an example, unlike other games, there are not merely two forms of tire squeal (on and off). Moving in quick will start at a low almost grip-less hum and then gradate into a fevered wail. The transition between states is virtually seamless.  One point of contention I developed with the audio component was with the spotter. He sounds fine and appropriate, for sure, but can often mislead or coax players into doing things against their betterment, especially if they are novices. Worse, he sometimes annoys with repetitive and constant remarks that are already glaringly apparent to anyone with eyes. ~In the middle, three wide.~    Thanks. ~In the middle, three wide.~    Yeah, I heard the first time... Thanks. ~In the middle, three wide.~   Why do you keep saying that?  ~In the middle, three wide.~   Yes, I can tell I'm in the damn middle... Three wide. Thank you. I understand. ~In the middle, three wide.~   Shut up! I've been here for the last minute! I know! Just shut the hell up! Shut UP!!! ~In the middle, three wide.~   The spotter can keep the car moving, but it's the crisp and clean graphics that keep the game moving, provided you have the system to fuel it. Drawing 42 cars ahead with full track details at 1024x768 resolution means you'd better have a at the minimum a GHz processor, GeForce 3, and 256MB of RAM. I did, and still was only able to attain a steady 30fps (very playable -- I'm not complaining).  I don't see anything substantially improved when compared to NASCAR 4 (a lot of people will no doubt confuse the screenshots), but there is certainly more polish abound. It's the little road details and sly trackside changes that help highlight the still impressive car models, complete with deforming chassis and billowing smoke, if the need arises.  If not for the blurred texture that makes up the audience, one might briefly mistake the game for an actual TV broadcast, even during play (not just replays). The cockpit is well articulated and not only realistically modeled, but somewhat realistically animated in the way it shakes and bakes. Seeing forty-two cars ahead of you with a huge Penzoil bumper jammed in your face as you wait behind the pace car is very believable. But so was NASCAR 4 before it.  Graphics and sound are important...for amateurs. Between you and me, a racer will be just another fleeting imprint on our hard drives without the play to back it up. And as we all know, in a game like this it's the level of artificial intelligence that makes or breaks the play.      Let's cut to it. NASCAR 2002 once again does not disappoint. Depending on how everything is tweaked to preference, the AI can be downright vicious and faithful in its behavior.  Since the game now, more than ever, revolves around drafting trains for success, the AI has to learn how to capitalize and manipulate these car conga lines to its advantage. And boy does it ever. Fall back in the middle of a train and you'll be overtaken. Edge too close to the leader, and he'll do his best to shake you. Try and psyche him to go high so you can make a low pass and he'll swing a low line out of spite, forcing you to slow or move high to avoid a bump. If you do try to pass on top it's either all or nothing. You get to the front of the pack, or you go to the end, because anyone behind you in the train will eat up your spot in a moment's notice. Nice.  A few quirks are still present. For one, caution flags seem to cause a great deal of confusion amongst the computerized drivers. When one loses his place in line it could take him a good minute or two to get back in, and you don't want to get flagged (which will happen often if you don't follow the many rules of the game), so it seems the burden is placed on you, and not him, to speed and slow enough to get him back in line but not enough to screw with those behind you. Good thing he's an idiot and takes his sweet ass time in hustling up.   Moreover, don't ever expect or rely on anyone ever budging at all either. If you move in low and try and squeeze the train leader into fearfully pulling up and away you'll quickly find yourself in a brutal spin if you haven't allowed yourself ample time and room to push it through at a low enough line. They'll die before they move. Perhaps a bit too competitive, no?   The same 43-player multiplayer that hit NASCAR 4 has made its return. Like before, you'll need a smoking connection and solid knowledge of with whom you're playing to get a kicking match going. Plenty of serious vets and fun loving racers populate the world of NASCAR Racing, but with them also comes the crash happy kids content with plowing into any and all things the second they feel a top seat is unattainable. Knowing your opponents and having a good connection naturally still results in an immensely enjoyable experience.  What did you think of NASCAR Racing Season 2002?  Even though the game features a total of 24 tracks (a huge amount, and a solid representation of the venues the sport has to offer), only three new ones make appearances. Chicagoland Speedway, Kansas Speedway, and Coca Cola Fantasy Track. The latter is a massive 3 mile wide open course with no restrictor plate rules, and very slight 36 degree turns resulting in what Darrell Waltrip describes as the potential for 240MPH speeds. Insane!  But... Like a lot of iteratively designed games, NASCAR Racing Season 2002 is not a markedly substantial improvement over NASCAR Racing 4. Rather, just as the latest in marquee sports franchises succeed and are content to work at only marginally improving what already existed before them, NASCAR 2002 analogously takes an already superb house, and simply decorates it. The result is a package comprised of the essential and fundamentally awesome base components of NASCAR 4 only expanded upon through more polish, the implementation of more features, and even a greater degree of applied accessibility. Perhaps this is where the name change stems from. Dubbing the game NASCAR 5 would have no doubt been a bit of a dubious stretch as far as fans of the series would be concerned. For really, the game could easily be sold as an expansion or even offered as a patch (some developers are courteous and cool enough to occasionally let out free expansion style patches -- it happens). I suppose they saw the change in moniker as an opportunity to allow themselves this extra bit of leeway in getting away with selling something old (but still changed) at a hefty full price. Obviously, I won't be so lenient if when next we meet all is the same. Undeniably, its new inclusions and slight alterations are plenty enough to be appreciable to the diehard fan and still attractive to the apprehensive newcomer. However, that percentage of casual gamers currently involved in NASCAR 4, but not overcome with lust at the sight of a new offering are not recommended to pick this one up. What you have will suffice, for you anyway. But, to settle the curiosity of the newbie and unquenchable thirst of the fanatic alike, nothing is better, or comes more highly recommended than NASCAR Racing Season 2002. Racing in a purist sense of the word (a notion CART fanboys no doubt find hilarious), NASCAR 2002 is supremely enjoyable provided you can open your mind to the possibility that a racing game need not involve winding turns, heavily populated streets, or Street Fighter esque combo tricks to be good. If you can invest enough time to master its intricacies and really get into it, NASCAR Racing Season 2002 is simply the best there is, but that's not to say it's remarkably better than the last champion, which coincidentally enough, happens to be the game's father.", "date": "Mar 7, 2002"}
