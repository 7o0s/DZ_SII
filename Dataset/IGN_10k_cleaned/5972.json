It essentially recycles games that have already been on the Game Boy Advance platform since day one and repackages them with a new front end. That's it. Nothing special here, folks.   Back when the Game Boy Advance launched in 2001, Mass Media was put to the task of creating two packages: Namco Museum, a collection of five classic Namco arcade games of varying genres, and Pac-Man Collection, a grouping of several games that starred the company's most recognizable hero. Both games were highly recommended cartridges for the GBA because the development team did a great job reproducing the arcade titles on the handheld hardware. The only thing missing was a chip to save high scores, but at the time publishers were saving that extra expense for games that couldn't survive without the save RAM.   Fast forward to almost exactly four years later. Those two game collections can still be picked up at the local game shops for a budget 20 dollars. So when Namco announced Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the GBA, we were expecting a new compilation of classics that we haven't yet experienced on the handheld., especially since this was to be a collection that celebrates the company's huge milestone. Instead, what we got were new reprogrammings of games that have already been released on the GBA: Ms. Pac-Man, Dig Dug, and Galaga are already on the original GBA Namco Museum, with Pac-Man showing up in Pac-Man Collection as well as last year's Classic NES Series edition. The only new addition is Rally-X. As classic as the game is, it just doesn't justify a new package, especially since this current collection's being priced around    The arcade games were ported by Digital Eclipse, a name not unfamiliar to the world of retrogaming. This team has pulled off some great classic reproductions on the GBA, including the darn fine Atari Anniversary Advance. Like that Atari collection, Namco Museum's collection of games are near spot-on to the arcade counterpart, and even includes different video modes to display the action. Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and Dig Dug all originally used vertically oriented video monitors, and these ports allow the player to switch from a squished or scrolling mode to a mode that turns the image 90 degrees, using the GBA's wider resolution to accurately simulate the original games' aspect ratio. Though it's not very comfortable to play this way on the GBA SP, this ~tall~ mode works extremely well on the upcoming Game Boy Micro.   But what else was done for this new package? Nothing. No historical elements, no creator notes, no trivia, no nothing. All that's been added is a cool rendered interface, with game selection as easy as rotating to the proper arcade machine. Players can change a couple settings to the gameplay, like adjusting how many extra lives a player has or what score players will earn these additional lives. Outside of this? Nothing.   So it's surprising to discover that Namco didn't even slip in an SRAM chip into this compilation package. Without one, any high score that players earn in the five games becomes wiped from memory when players either turn off the system or jump to another game. And when these games focused on challenging players to best their top scores, the package loses precious points because players lose theirs.  Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary is good, but it's not good enough. We've already experienced 80 percent of these games on the handheld already, and even though the newer ports are slightly better than the previous ones there's just not enough in this package that justifies a second take. If you haven't scored the classics yet, then this is a good buy, just keep in mind that your earned high scores are temporary. The lack of SRAM is an incredible disappointment, especially this late in the GBA's life where even the most basic of game developments earn the precious save chip.", "date": "Aug 30, 2005"}
