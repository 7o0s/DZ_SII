Between Nanosaur, Bugdom, and Cro-Mag Rally, this unique developer has made a name for itself with fun, colorful games that appeal to a broad spectrum of users.  With Otto-Matic, a game mixing action, adventure, and platform elements, Pangea Software looks to continue on its roll of hits.  In the game you take on the role of Otto Matic, a friendly robot, who must save humanity from the evil Brain Aliens of Planet X.  Because the aliens have taken the humans to far-ranging planets, you too must travel the galaxy to rescue them.  The graphical style of Otto Matic is clearly reminiscent of previous Pangea titles, and that's not a bad thing.  In an era of games striving for realism in their graphics, Otto Matic comes as a welcome respite.  The world is lush and colorful with a cheerful, Nintendo-like quality that doesn't take itself too seriously.  Gamers looking to push their graphics cards to their limits might be put off by the somewhat simplistic graphics, but the presentation is full of character and allows the game to run at a solid framerate on even modest hardware.  The music in Otto Matic is in line with the theme of a campy sci-fi movie.  It has a very retro feel that will either further engross you in the experience or will just begin to annoy you.  Depending on how well you're playing, it could do both.  Sound effects are competently executed, particularly Otto's.  The metallic quality of his body is well represented by the sounds it makes interacting with the environment around him.    Gameplay in Otto Matic follows the tried and true formula found in most games of the genre.  You'll explore the various locales looking for humans to rescue and enemies to fight or avoid.  What keeps Otto Matic fresh is the variety of enemies and how the player must use different weapons and power-ups to most effectively deal with them.  This twist on gameplay is a welcome distinction that should appeal to gamers looking for a little more depth.   Its hard to dislike Pangeas gaming vision.  The graphics are imaginative and fun, the sound is appropriate, and the gameplay is suitable for all gamers, from children to adults.  The problem is that Otto Matic loses some of its luster when not looked at in a vacuum.  If you have never played Bugdom, Otto Matic is an excellent introduction into the world of Pangea games.  For many gamers, though, there simply might not be enough motivation to play through another game that is so similar to Bugdom.  Luckily, Pangea has released a demo of Otto Matic so that we can make an informed purchasing decision.", "date": "Jun 29, 2002"}
