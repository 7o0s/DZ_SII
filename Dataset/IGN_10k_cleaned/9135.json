It's a good idea, in theory. Kids aren't reading as much, so lets try to stick something that's valuable into those video games they play so much. Big Blue Bubble tried its hand at converting the classic Scholastic puzzle books, I SPY, into an educational Nintendo DS game. I SPY Fun House is a nice idea, but entirely unnecessary since the books are cheaper and way more fun.   I SPY should be familiar to anyone that went to elementary school in the 1990s. For the youngsters and dinosaurs, I SPY is a book series of picture riddles. Large, artistic pictures accompany two line riddles naming objects to find. I SPY Fun House takes that premise and puts it into a video game, while throwing in a few extra mini games.   The fun house holds six different illustrations, each one with three riddles to create a total of 18 puzzles. The pictures are smaller than the ones in the book, so everything to find is pretty close together. They are big enough to require players to scroll using either the touch screen of D-pad. Players tap on the touch screen to highlight the item they're looking for. The puzzles just don't have the appeal that the books do. Sure, they're I SPY-esque but there's something missing. These are not Walter Wick's photo illustrations, which were works of art in themselves.   Since there are three riddles per illustration, players will become intimately familiar with the pictures of carousels and playing cards. The biggest problem with the puzzles is that the picture is so small and cramped that players will see everything in it the first time around. This makes the second and third rounds cakewalks because nothing has changed. A couple of the puzzles have interesting twists at least. The X-Ray puzzle for instance has a button that turns on a, you guessed it, x-ray mode that reveals hidden items. Oddly enough this is one of the easiest puzzles in the game though.   Some of the puzzles are done book style, like Brain Age. There are four other games in the fun house: Listen up, a carnival themed version of Simon; Pop 'n' Drop, a puzzle clone; Hoop Shot, a Venn diagram matching game; and Prize Popper, which is item matching skeeball. There's a pretty basic theme of matching objects linking most of the games. Even for a kids game it's pretty rudimentary, but most of the games have dozens of rounds that make it more complicated. Still, unless the player is in the single digit age range, matching ~green objects~ from ~round objects~ is not going to be very difficult.   The game is ~won~ when players collect 10 tickets, thus earning their way out of the fun house. Since each puzzle gives a ticket, and every ten round of the simple games does too, earning 10 tickets takes about an hour. After leaving the fun house, players are just dumped back in again and told to earn 10 more tickets. The second time around it takes a little more time since the minigames stay on the round they got left at. However, the I SPY puzzles are still the same, and they really aren't fun twice. Why didn't the developers just make it so that 20 or 30 tickets bought the player's freedom so that they wouldn't notice as quickly that this is only a fraction of a game?   The thing about the I SPY book series is that they're only about 10 bucks each online. For the same price as this game, someone could buy three I SPY books. That's about 40 puzzles. Each puzzle will take as long, if not longer than playing each of the video game's puzzles three times. I SPY is really only suitable then for fans of the book series that have already played through all 13 entries. The irony is that anyone that is that big of an I SPY fan will be underwhelmed and quickly bored by this title.Books aren't cool anymore. Scholastic has to reach to out to the new batch of schoolchildren through another means and they've tried to do so with I SPY on the DS. It's an admirable effort, but there just isn't enough game here to justify purchasing. If there were more puzzles, or if they were more difficult to solve it would be a better game. The fact of the matter is that this game is made to be played by kids too young to have seen the I SPY books, so why don't they just get the books and get more use out of those?", "date": "Oct 2, 2007"}
