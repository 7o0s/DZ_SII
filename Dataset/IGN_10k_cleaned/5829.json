After all, from Europe come gems like the Battlefield games, Far Cry, and Serious Sam, to name a few. You might notice, however, that those are all shooters, arguably the least complicated to design. When you try to break out, which is always admirable in an industry driven by franchises, it's that much more important to explain exactly what's going on. Unfortunately, the box copy doesn't quite get the point across that this is not your typical Medieval adventure. In fact, Traps of Darkness is more like a puzzle game than anything else, where the setting is purely cosmetic. While I can get around the fact that the game is poorly presented, and I have nothing in particular against puzzle games, the odd blend ToD presents is a little underwhelming.   Instead of adventuring through some fictional Medieval land and collecting items along the way that open gets you need to get through to progress, as the box copy suggests, what you have is a series of small stages where you must compete against AI players to collect keys that open doors that leads to a gate. Sometimes it only takes about a minute to lose the round, with sheer brute power winning the day. Of the seven character classes, it seems like the Stone Golem invariably crushes the competition. This is what happens when you give a unit lots of armor and a ranged attack. The guy is a tank, basically.   But he also moves slowly, and I got a little impatient with this game, so I chose the Magician. He has a short range attack, ironically, but he can turn completely invisible while moving at full speed, which comes in quite handy. When the enemy AI can barely be bothered to make a few half-hearted swings at you in the first place, you're nearly a ghost with this guy. And it's a good thing that the game is more trap-oriented than combat-oriented, because defensive capabilities are surprisingly limited. You can evade quite a bit, but you can't to things like block, parry, or deflect. It's mindless Diablo clicking.   While the traps can be quite effective, they're also pretty aggravating, because it usually means instant death. The teleporter is a favorite, which is typically used to zap you into one of the many doorways that use vicious, snapping metal jaws as an arbitrary design conceit. Most of these can be disabled with a nearby switch (which is often trapped), so it's a hit-or-miss proposition--literally. Meanwhile, your health meter (which is also your magic meter) depletes at a constant rate. You regain it by killing the opponents, finding the occasional refill vial, or revisiting the regeneration circle. As a nice touch, it's impossible to trap this circle, although you can be attacked while you're standing on it, particularly by the churning layer of vermin. While these beasts ensure that you can't camp a trap and take the loot dropped by your enemy, they're more annoying than challenging.     So when you die, you lose all your items, although the map is very small and getting back into things isn't an issue. This is a problem for you because you can drop one of those precious keys. Since one key typically unlocks a door to a room hiding another key that opens a door to another room with a key and so forth, fighting with the enemy isn't as important as simply moving quickly and setting traps to slow your opponents. In theory, at least. In practice, the AI fight each other meaninglessly when they should be trapping each other and grabbing the loot that falls. Hence, the Stone Golem beats everyone else into submission and you eventually fall prey to a trap or zigging when you should zag (since the key setup is decidedly unintuitive, awkward, and unconfigurable). Since traps are invisible to the player (unless you pick up a rare power up that allows you to see all of them temporarily), traps are far more effective than combat. No one can counter traps--even the rogue-like character has no save roll.   Speaking of characters, there are none that are really balanced. The Beastmaster comes close, but he's still relatively wispy when it comes to taking a hit. The knight hits hard and takes a beating, but he moves slowly. With speed being such a factor here, slowness is not good--unless you have a ranged attack like the tank Golem.   Unfortunately, the game doesn't get any extra points for at least looking nice. This is shareware-caliber stuff. The resolution appears to be locked at 800x600, the maximum resolution, the interface is enormous, the animation stiff, the 2D textures generic It's very dated, on the whole. The slanted overhead perspective also makes it difficult to discern between a wall and a door, since they chose not to make it isometric. The sound effects are limited, save for the constant and unintentionally hilarious taunting your enemies will dish out. It's not what they say so much as the thick layers of ham they lay on each catch phrase. It's difficult to take the game seriously (and the intro custscene suggests a lot more humor than I saw in-game, creating an uneasy mix). If you want bells and whistles, you're not going to find them here.   There is multiplayer, but not surprisingly, we couldn't find anyone else playing the game. I don't think I could in good conscience convince someone to buy this game just so that I could play against something more interesting than the AI provided by the game.Necromania: Traps of Darkness gets points for trying something a little different. Unfortunately, it doesn't do it well. It also looks like something out of the mid-90s. More importantly, it feels like an old, forgettable game risen from the grave. With a little more depth, a little more polish on the visuals, and some better character balancing, it could have been one of those ~simple but fun~ games like Katamari or pulling lint out of your bellybutton. Instead, it's not as interesting as either, and it takes a lot longer to do.", "date": "Jun 16, 2005"}
