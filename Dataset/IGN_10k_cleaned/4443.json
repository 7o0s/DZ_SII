Pro-Pinball", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/09/04/timeshock-pro-pinball", "text": "Timeshock is the second in Empire's Pro-Pinball series, certainly not a shoddy game of pinball by any means. The only table in the game features an overwhelming amount of ramps, lights, and bumpers. It even has one of those new-school dot-matrix displays that's so popular in pinball machines nowadays, throwing tons and tons of rendered four-shades-of-orange video animations over the game screen as the ball cruises around the playfield. There's even a few basic ~video mode~ bonus games, but only if you land the ball in the right hole.  This pinball game also utilizes the PlayStation's highest resolution, giving the table an incredibly crisp, photo-realistic look. The ball physics are also spot-on, from the way it rolls down the playfield to how it ricochets off the powered bumpers and flippers. And, you got it, the game features the ever-popular multiball mode that really puts the game's physics in action.  The only real problem here is very simple  there's only one table. There are a handful of variations, but there's no way of tap-dancing around the fact that once you've careened the ball around the table for an hour or so, you've seen it all. Even the gallery, which is little more than a slideshow of rendered closeups of the Timeshock table, is just a quick five-minute trip. I love pinball. I spend more time on pinball machines at the arcade than at all the fighting and driving games put together. There's something about real-world action that intrigues me, and there's nothing more chaotic and unpredictable as silverball.That said, I enjoyed Timeshock. For a bit. But after I discovered pretty much everything, all the bonuses, tricks, and videomodes, I was done with it. It was a nice two hours, but it was time to move on. It's a splendidly designed pinball machine, but it's pretty weak that they only included one single machine on the disk. And at forty bucks for the game, that's not exactly a bargain.So, I mark the score down simply because it's only a game you'll play for maybe a half-hour at a time. It's really only worth a rental.", "date": "Sep 4, 1998"}
