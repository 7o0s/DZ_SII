We've long anticipated a game that could blend the real-time strategy and action genres in a multiplayer format. Games like Tribes have offered a taste of this but titles that have wholeheartedly committed to the concept, such as Allegiance, have likewise managed to fall short in key areas. And while there are still some problems with Savage, the overall effect is addictive, in terms of originality and solid design.  For those who don't know, the story behind the game is quite compelling. I always respect developers who attempt to do a low-tech story without reference to the usual suspects of dwarves and elves. In this case, humans and humanoid beasts are thrown into conflict millions of years after a worldwide apocalypse all but eliminated the human race. Having only just rediscovered long lost technologies, the humans are coming in to power again and the beasts are intent on stopping them. The player is thrust then in to a conflict between science and nature, man and beast -- a conflict as old as Gilgamesh and Enkidu. The fact that the beasts are now somewhat intelligent or can walk on two legs isn't really explained but that's not much of a problem. At least it's not any dumber than saying, ~Hey, there are elves.~  There are some parts of the backstory that aren't all that tight but, as with a game like Battlefield, the focus is on the small battles, not the war. Each player is probably better off simply creating their own context for the battles. This mess about the human leader's sister going off and teaching the creatures how to use magic isn't as compelling an organizing influence as the beasts' natural fear of human pollution or their desire to seek vengeance for the humans' past transgressions. But as I said, you're supposed to be a local participant in a largely unseen global conflict. When the Behemoths start marching on your base, you don't so much care why they're there anymore.  In any case, once the action starts, you're likely to be hooked. Each player begins with a small amount of gold and an extra, optional ranged weapon. You earn more gold by killing other players, hunting the local wildlife or damaging enemy structures. A percentage of this gold is siphoned off to be used by the overall commanders for the development of extra tactical options. As these new technologies and spells become available, you can spend your gold to buy them for your character. You will also have the chance to but upgraded character types, with stronger characters being balanced out with reduced speed or hit points.  It's a sound concept and one that definitely encourages players to approach the game in the spirit in which it was designed -- not always an easy task for developers of multiplayer games, particularly those with an underlying economy. S2 Games should be commended for looking beyond creating a game that forces the players to cooperate and instead crafting a game that really rewards and encourages that sense of cooperation and common effort.  In my own experience, I've found myself surprised that I'm willing to do as the commander says, even as more interesting opportunities arise. In one case, a commander caught me on my way to attack an enemy base and asked me instead to harvest stone for buildings. I did it gladly, secure in the knowledge that, with his strategic perspective, he had an agenda that was more important than mine. Soon two other workers joined me and we managed to get the stone supply up to where the commander wanted. We all three took off for the nearest enemy base but were pulled back by the commander to construct a guard tower over our new sub-base. We did that too.    The only real gripe with this particular sequence has nothing to do with following someone else's orders. I just find it slightly ridiculous that the only action a player can take is animated as an attack. Want to harvest stone? Hit it. Want to hurry building construction? Just hit it. Want to repair a damaged outpost? Hit that too. A new animation would go a long way to bringing you deeper in to the world. On that same subject, I have to add that you have to keep hitting the attack button. Why isn't this type of action controlled as a toggle, rather than forcing us to rapidly press the mouse button again and again?      But while it's an essential job, it rarely results in the kind of excitement you get from fighting directly with the enemy. The melee combat in the game takes a bit of getting used to as the quick swings and odd collision detection can have you dancing around your opponent without seeming to hit them at all. After an hour or so, you learn to anticipate the tactics you'll need to hold your own. Circling around, falling back, rushing ahead -- all are tactics suited to particular situations. Things are much more straightforward with the missile weapons, but the melee portions of the game are just as important.  Most of the basic troop types aren't equipped to take out the large structures, so you'll have to call in the big siege weapons. Unfortunately, the human siege units aren't nearly as visually impressive as those of the beasts. On the human side, you actually take the form of catapults and ballistae that travel about the map. (Strangely the vehicles are always in a perfect horizontal orientation, even when traveling over the slopes of the game.) But the big beast units, like the tree-wielding Behemoth, are just so much more impressive.  In terms of balance, I tend to think that the other late beast unit, the Summoner, is too powerful, primarily when equipped with a mana crystal. The long range, high impact spells that this guy can wield make it a nearly unbeatable choice...at least when played smartly. But the seeming lack of balance may simply be the result of the opposing players being unaware of the tactics required to take down specific, powerful units. Though one person can make a real difference in Savage, the combined efforts of a swarm of smart players can topple even the largest, game-winning type units the other team is fielding.  The notion of teamwork is strong in the game and, like Tribes and Battlefield, once you understand the fundamentals of the game, you can go on instinct as far as working with other players goes. This is when the game gets good. Sure, it can be frustrating when the rest of your team seem totally clueless and I've had to jump in as commander from time to time when things just weren't advancing.  In all, about a third of the matches we've played seem to hit the experience the developers intended. Another third are enjoyable but not as tight while the final third of matches seem too disorganized and the smart and responsible player will really have to hustle around the map to take charge of specific situations. Even without a commander, you'll still be notified when structures are under attack. The handy mini-map directs you to the scene of the action.  The maps themselves are really well designed, in part because they seem so, well, designed. It's almost as if someone's taken the original Warcraft maps and rendered them in full 3D. They're not as big as maps in many other shooters but that helps to focus the action a bit more. Additionally, the game makes use of many corridors and chokepoints to throw players against each other with a surprising regularity. Some hills and paths are hotly contested where two bases are close together.  It's probably best to keep your hands off the commander's controls until you've developed a good understanding of what's going on at the soldier's level. This is, in fact, one of the bigger problems with the game as there's no real forum in which to practice your command skills. New players will endure many an impeachment vote -- and much bitching besides -- as they get the hang of the strategic side of the game.    But S2 Games has skillfully managed to hit just the right balance in terms of depth in the RTS portion of the game. As a pure real-time strategy game, Savage won't offer the range of options available in many triple-A RTS games. What it does offer is enough depth and focus to support the action of the individual ground soldiers in the war between beasts and humans. And it presents it in a format that will be familiar to anyone who's played a real-time strategy game in the last five years.      Most games that attempt to blend the two genres fall short on one key aspect -- orders aren't enforceable. Plus people are jerks. Okay, so two key aspects. But in any case, Savage makes following orders easy with a nice title bar outlining what you're supposed to be doing, and a handy on-screen waypoint telling you where it needs to be done. The commander can also reward players by purchasing upgrades for them from the team's overall gold pool. Towards the end of a match, good commanders will have also built up a number of beneficial spells and abilities that can assist players in the field.  In addition to the human players, each side begins with a main base and a few workers. The commander is responsible for directing the actions of workers, either to build new structures or harvest the game's two resources, stone and gold. Extra buildings allow for the research of new technologies that translate into new units type and new weapon availability for the actual combatants. A number of additional structures, based in science for the humans and magic for the beasts, further open up the range of equipment and turret upgrades.  This new technology allows you to customize your character beyond the simple choice of character type. Some weapons are better suited to certain tasks -- sniping, building demolition, fighting en masse, etc. -- and players will have to find their own roles based on their preferences and the situation at hand. The versatility of this system, where players effectively build their own unit, makes for some surprising variety in the game. The beast equipped with the carnivorous power can regain health by damaging enemies -- perfect for picking on guys littler than you. The beast with the mist shroud can become invisible, making him the perfect infiltrator and worker-killer.    Though I quite like the overall visual style of the game, the quality of the graphics does leave a bit to be desired. Since the game is simultaneously presented in a FPS and RTS format (and both using the same assets no less), I'm willing to cut S2 Games a bit of slack here. The animations are fairly natural overall but can still seem slightly stiff in places. The effects display an arcade sensibility with plenty of sparkles and bright colors. It works overall, not because of the believability of the effects but because of their uniformity. What I mean is that, though the effects aren't as impressive as those in other shooters, the overall consistency in the visual style keeps you from questioning the quality. No description of Savage does justice to the experience itself. At least, that's true of the matches where things are actually working according to the designers' intent. As I said, the proportion of matches seems divided in even thirds - a third are fantastic, a third are tolerable, and a third are simply frustrating.As more people get into the game, I expect the proportions to remain the same, at least in the short term. Given a few months to congeal the community and combat of Savage has the potential to offer a higher percentage of matches focused on intense and sophisticated play.Still, even when saddled with a terrible Unnamed Newbie for a commander and a team of total idiots, you'll find that you can make a significant contribution as an individual. It's just much more effective when people are working together.Since the developers have created a system that encourages this type of cooperation, we can't fault them for the matches that the players spoil. Still, as an online-only game, you have to take the other players into consideration when determining the overall fun factor. For now the moments when the game does work as it should are more than enough fun to keep us playing through the down times.", "date": "Sep 13, 2003"}
