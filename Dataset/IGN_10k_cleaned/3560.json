Former EIC Trent Ward's mom was an amateur archaeologist and helped to cultivate this interest throughout my high school years. Once I entered college, I quickly discovered that there was a lot more to archaeology than shooting Nazis and whipping guys in turbans. My own experiences in the field of archaeology always seemed to involve an awful lot of dusting of pot sherds. (Don't call them shards.) In the true spirit of the university hierarchy it was the grad students who seemed to draw all the choice jobs that involved mine cart racing or Thugee punching.   Screw this, I thought. I'll get a job reviewing video games instead.   Thankfully the gang over at The Collective have finally managed to combine my earlier fascination with the pulp-era tomb raider with my duties as a game reviewer. Their latest game, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, finally gives me the chance to go head-to-head with the finest the Reich and the Far East have to offer. And in keeping with my own bloodthirsty tendencies, this Indy does a lot more killing.   There's a strong serial aspect to the game as Indy finds himself in a seemingly endless succession of tight spots. The game tells the story of Indy's quest to recover a powerful pearl. He travels to numerous locations in the Orient as well as Eastern Europe and Asia Minor. As usual his employers are somewhat suspect right from the start and the game does a good job of building up a sense of rivalry among the main characters. Still, the plot here can't quite seem to rise to the standard established by the films.   While the game was initially designed to be played with a gamepad, Indy's keyboard controls are actually quite good. When controlling Indy in a third-person perspective, you'll use the WASD keys to move him around. He moves relative to the screen rather than his own facing. In other words, hitting ~A~ moves Indy to the left of the screen rather than to his own left. Although this system is more intuitive on the gamepad, you'll be adjusted to the same principles on the keyboard after only a few minutes' play.   Ideally, the camera almost always rests above and behind your character. You simply need to move the mouse to point Indy in a new direction. The camera rotates a bit quicker than Indy does, but rather than being a detriment, this actually adds a little more personality to the game. You'll get to see Indy from a few different angles, even catching a few glimpses of him side-on as he mows down Nazis and/or Ninjas.   But there are numerous camera problems resulting from the cramped nature of many of the environments. The camera frequently gets hung up on the environment and is occasionally obscured by walls, pillars, and the like. There is a first-person aiming mode, but Indy turns far too slowly in this mode for it to be really useful. Thankfully, there's a bit of an auto-aim feature built in to the game so you can reasonably expect to hit things if you only point in their direction. In any case, the first-person mode doesn't allow you to move Indy around and is therefore of questionable use.   There is also simply too much damn swimming in the game. While it's good preparation for piggybacking on submarines, there's no reason Indiana Jones should have to spend so much time underwater. Perhaps I wouldn't mind if the swimming controls weren't so absolutely terrible. Completely disregarding the regular movement keys, you have to hit an extra key to get Indy to move forward through the water. This can make it tricky to negotiate some of the tight corners you'll find yourself in underwater. Trying to switch inventory items while coordinating all this is almost impossible.   And even worse, Indy seems to get stuck on almost every object he gets remotely close to. And while I can safely sit there for a few minutes before his breath runs out, the fact that there are hungry alligators and sharks in nearly every body of water you come across means that a moment's hesitation could spell instant disaster.   Lovers of jumping puzzles, rejoice! Indy constantly finds himself separated from his objective by numerous canyons, chasms, rifts and holes. For the most part, these are relatively easy to clear but there are a few instances where you need to time your jump down to the last pixel. Still, grabbing on to a nearly-missed ledge with your fingertips is more exciting than frustrating.   There's also a healthy dose of whip-swinging to be found. A handy icon appears in the top corner of your screen to let you know when you've reached an opportunity to swing across an area using your whip. You can instantly switch to the whip at that point using your action key, so you needn't mess around with the otherwise cumbersome inventory selection process. A few sequences even have you jumping off a ledge before you can hit the anchor of your swing with your whip. Excitement, indeed.   The icon that clues you in to your chance to use your whip also alerts you when you have a chance to interact with other puzzle objects. Walk up to a lever that can be pulled, and a pull icon appears. While this type of approach babies you somewhat, it also eliminates the frustration of not knowing when you're supposed to do something important.   For the most part, the puzzles are simple enough even for the console editors to have a chance at solving them. But with the exception of the Zodiac-clock puzzle, these aren't really puzzles at all. Instead you'll have a series of levers to pull, cracked walls to demolish and door to unlock. There are a few lever puzzles that require you to complete them in a certain order but there's never any chance to pull the wrong lever and ruin the level. Even the giant crane puzzle is sadly free of any room for error.   While it's not necessarily less-direct, the combat is much more interesting than the puzzles. Thankfully the second half of the game actually starts to emphasize combat more and more. Indy's attacks include a few cool combos that are quite easy to pull off with the rather fluid interface. Things like grabs are even incorporated if you need to throw someone off of a roof or in to another charging opponent.    As far as my own experience goes, the whip is pretty useless. You can use it to knock several enemies back at once or even disarm enemies but the ranges have to be just right or you'll just be cracking empty air. In all, I never really found anything that beat Indy's fists for close-in combat -- not even the curved blades I picked up in Istanbul. Guns are a different story but the amount of ammunition spread throughout the level tend to put the emphasis on hand-to-hand fighting anyway.   The AI provides a reasonable challenge. Enemies are surprisingly smart (although they will stand on top of grenades from time to time). Otherwise, they know how to team up on you. Even better, enemies can pick up items dropped by other characters and use them against you. There are a few pathfinding issues here and there but, for the most part, the enemies in Indiana Jones are bright enough to keep you on your toes. The few bosses are much more scripted in terms of behavior and don't seem to react as well to your own moves.   The levels in Indiana Jones are reasonably short and broken in to bite-sized bits for easy consumption. Since there's no save system in the middle of the levels, this more compartmentalized approach keeps you from having to do a lot of backtracking. Each level is rich with atmosphere and detail -- from ancient temples to Eastern cities. There's also a real sense of vertical space here as well with lots of varying heights spread throughout the level.   Apart from the overall spirit and mood of the levels, the real stars here are the character models and animations. The Indiana Jones model is nearly perfect although he seems a bit too old to fit in the continuity of the films. His appearance even changes slightly between levels (some scenes with a jacket, some without, basically). The other character models are equally well done if not as recognizable.   The animations are fantastic and give an illusion of greater variety than they perhaps really provide. Fighting combos are terribly cinematic with wide punches that really seem like they connect. Indy's hat can even come off in a fight and you'll need to make sure to pick it up before moving on if you want to keep your head cool. Indy also grabs hold of his hat while rolling (under quickly closing doors and such) so it won't fall off. There are a few blending issues (like when quickly Indy holsters an item he's carrying so he can grab on to ledges), but these are merely concessions to keeping the game fun.   But all is not well with the graphics. While I like the character built in to each environment, a few technical issues conspire to make the game world seem less than real. First and most significantly, the game still has some irritating clipping problems. While most of the objects are reliable solid, I've been able to walk through tables from time to time. Most of the other clipping annoyances are considerably less problematic from a gameplay standpoint but still compromise the illusion. Additionally there are several open seams here and there in the game's environments.    I'm really impressed with most the sound work in the game. Most essential was the casting of David Esch as Indiana Jones. Although Mrs. Ford probably wouldn't be fooled, he does a tremendous job of replicating Harrison's sounds and rhythms. The other actors do reasonably well -- from the Belloq wannabe to Jones' heavily-accented Asian ~patrons.~   Musically, you'll find a great use of the Raiders theme, which comes up now and then according to specific triggers. It really helps to highlight the action (or let you know when there's nothing more to fight). The rest of the game's score shares the same spirit and atmosphere as Williams' score so well that you'll be hard pressed to tell where the archival material ends and the new composition begins.   What did you think of Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb?   The only poor parts of the sound palette are the weapons' sounds. The MP-40 stutters and burps, to be sure, but not with the force you'd expect it to. It's more like a ladies' tea party burp than the frat kegger style you'd expect. Likewise, the crack of the whip just falls short of being convincing. Explosions and such could stand a bit of a punch as well.The Xbox version suffers a bit from comparisons to Collective's recent Buffy game but there's a bit more room for this title to shine on the PC (despite the glut of Tomb Raider games). My biggest gripes against the game are the tricky camera and the horrible and frequent swimming bits. The interface is also somewhat clunky interface but, outside of these three issues, I had a lot of fun putting on my fedora and punching the crap out of Nazis and enriching the collections of museums worldwise.While there are plenty of better games on the PC, none give you your recommended daily allowance of Indy quite like this one. Fans of the film will definitely be able to overlook the minor (but recurring) failings. Fans of platform action will have less patience for the game's shortcomings but will still find the overall experience enjoyable, if a little straightforward.", "date": "Apr 2, 2003"}
