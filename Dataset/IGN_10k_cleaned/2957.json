Anything I do or do not spew is irrelevant (falsely assuming anything else I say is of some importance, of course). Any gripe I find can be disregarded... The price makes it worthwhile. Any positives I'll commend will only be compounded by a factor of ten... The price makes the worthwhile all that much better. It's free, so how can I judge, rate, recommend, or otherwise give opinion on a product that can be enjoyed by all without consequence?  It's still a game.   Like all games (those things you used to enjoy before becoming the bitter and jaded shell that you are now, Dan Adams), the online-centric, team-based, tactical first-person shooter that is America's Army: Operations comes complete with a slew of good and bad. Price, or lack thereof, is certainly a factor in a ~professional~ sand script scrawled review such as this, but the good and bad determine all.   I'll not ever rate the road trip of Hooters a ten, even if they paid me a substantial amount of money to. Despite working for an Internet publication and being a pop-culture bombarded boy of 21, I still, amazingly enough, retain a fair bit of integrity. The good and bad is what I live and die by. The good and bad keeps me employed, you interested, and sloppy developers in check. If I dismissed all the wrongs of this game and justified such a careless blind eye because of marketing strategy, then I'd be doing you a disservice. You come to IGN for a reason, to be informed. Upon the deliverance of this information, you then will undoubtedly wreak terrible havoc on us with constant a berating and inane email. Such is my life. I have come to accept it.   Blessed be the zealots who are loyal and vocal fanboys of the tactical first-person shooter. Clearly they are superior to everyone and of greatest importance. I fear them and writing reviews because of them, but nonetheless, the free ArmyOps is both good and bad.  Since America's Army: Operations is clearly worth the price, is it worth the play and the time? For the hardcore currently enthralled in Counter-Strike and playing Tactical Ops simply because it exists, that's a resounding yes. For everyone else, that's a ~download it to see what it looks like and then get quickly fed up with random grenades and tedious training exercises.~    I know, I know... You haven't even gotten your final CD yet, what's up with the review? Here's the thing, even though you may not have been able to enjoy the pressed final, what's already out and available to you, is still technically for review. Think about it like this: Was it right of us to have reviewed Ultima IX when it came out, or should we have waited a year for all the patches to come? The same can be said about ArmyOps. What you're playing may not include every single little thing of the final, but it is still final. The product is an incremental release, which means constant patches will be forthcoming. It also means that what you got should never have to be uninstalled in order for what's to come to function properly -- a single release that's expanded with time.  So...  The game does not make us privy to the coolest parts of the Army. Because this is an officially sanctioned product designed to offer the average Joe a taste of the action in store for the average enlistee, there is no OICW, thermal goggles, controllable vehicles, or anything of the technologically advanced sort. It's a very tight and regimented offering of different, but old-school, zero-frill mechanical weapons that are decidedly lacking in the electronically advanced department. Believe it or not, there is no shotgun or pistol. But there is plenty of grenade action.   The lack of a lot can be attributed to the game's insistence on being very much Army. This is both a plus and a problem.   I doubt normal troops blindly toss lethal explosives into every crevasse, open door, or concrete nook without a thought to what might happen when they explode, but the people here sure do. Remember with whom you're playing. Normally these children of the Internet bunny-hop and rocket-sling, now they're throwing grenades straight into the air without a care in the world. The result is the same: chaos and death at the hand of lucky landings. I'm of course speaking of tight machinegun fights where cover and placement are thrown to the wind by the jerk whom prefers to equip himself with an M16 accompanied by M203 grenade launcher and then promptly go nuts with the fragmented death. Add this to sometimes sloppy networking code and performance issues and chances are you won't even spot the in-flight explosive until you're viewing the match from spectator mode.  There should be a huge penalty for tossing these balls of fire about -- a choice to limit their use and one to decrease their effectiveness. They kill instantly and are incredibly hard to avoid. Realistic? Sure. Fun? Hardly. One going off just around the corner spells devastation, while oddly enough, another that hits in front of you whilst you bravely cower behind a door won't cause a scratch. It's an odd balance that's more of a nuisance than anything.  Worse is the smoked off grenade (after the pin has been pulled and the spoon released, a grenade can be held for a few seconds, making it explode the moment it hits the ground if timed properly). When encountering the smoked off grenade, a soldier can either die or hope that he/she is by chance not in the same vicinity as it. Tactical fun, no?   The problem isn't so much to do with the lethality of the grenade (a non-lethal one would be even more obscene). No, it's rather the slow and plodding nature of movement that ruins the experience in this regard. There is no quick burst of energy. Getting up from laying down takes time. Turning around and initiating a double-tap sprint without clipping into the wall takes time. A grenade that is about to explode in one half of a second does not allow for this necessary time. It seems to me like there should be a panic button similar to the one that every soldier has hardwired into his or her brain that determines the fight or rapidly flight response. If only I could depress this button and watch as my character bolted and dove for cover, I could avoid needless deaths, a main problem with the title.       I'd even settle for a Wolfenstein-esque stamina bar. When the ~adrenaline~ gets activated, moves like running and jumping and screaming for dear life should be accomplished much quicker. It's simply too hard not to get hit by a grenade without any kind of assistance. Every corner is a potential graveyard, every doorway a deathtrap. And since matches can force a player to wait a good seven minutes after death (God bless you, ye idiotic camper), getting picked off by a random bit of explosive love Asamo_Ben_Laden_664 left for you while trying to take out someone else across the map is plain frustrating.  Had the game been a bit more forgiving in some areas (such as the above mentioned) it would have complimented the slower, unmanageable movements of the characters. Equally so, had it been more realistic in other areas, we wouldn't be seeing NeoRanger doing the unwanted damage that he does.  As is, it's often times simply too hard to get a good, lasting, or even satisfying machinegun bout going. Dodging, hiding, and fleeing are nearly pointless. Play comes from position. But, I do recognize that speeding things up would have ruined the methodical, tactical, and believably tense style. My solution is to tone down the grenade action by imposing more deficiencies to counter the positives. I also think it's vital to use some kind of defensive-centric adrenaline function with its own set of problems to help keep the good, but misfortunate player alive.  But these problems aren't to say the whole of America's Army is not good to the core. When achieved, the sense of teamwork is profound and the feeling of accomplishment grand. Taking out four enemies without so much as a nick and then proceeding to hide behind a SAW toting friend only to then free a prisoner, take an installation, or defend a point, is really freaking cool.   Unfortunately, as seems to be the case with most recent offerings, ArmyOps' play is directly related to ArmyOps' maps. Even though this is the Army (an attack/defend kind of institution), a little more than simple keep or take play should be available. Because it's a game, it should include things from other games, like modes, for instance. Thankfully, the maps that are offered are diverse and enjoyable enough to last quite a while. Just be sure the first thing you do upon play is complete every single training scenario available, else you'll be subject to the problem of cycling servers that disallow players because prerequisites have not been met. And singleplayer? Well, there is none, so to hell with that.  On to the standards. Sound is fairly spectacular. Fairly but not genuinely. It's all the newness and goodness attached with modern technology, only in speaker form. But where's the shouting and frantic Army nature? Where are the cries for help? Futile pleas of the opposing force for mercy? Indeed, aside from sporadic gunfire and the bursts of explosives, these rounds are surprisingly quiet. This adds atmosphere and tension to the title, but prevents things from being excited or panicked. It's akin to what Stephen accurately pointed out to be a fault with Battlefield. The Omaha Beach map didn't feel like Omaha Beach because nothing would be happening at times. Dead silence in the midst of a brutal war is wrong. I'd expect a firefight between Army ass kickers and slacking terrorists to be a bit more vocal and excited. But this doesn't change the outward quality of the effects, which, though not technically up to Soldier of Fortune II's range-based brilliance, are quite pleasant.  What did you think of America's Army?  I'm sorry to say, these graphics are not the greatest around. That blaze of fire you see is the trail of burning death following the mass of flame mails coming my way. Character models are woefully substandard, don't animate well, feature zero facial animations, have no applied ragdoll physics (perhaps the coolest effect found in these new Unreal powered games), and are textured rather poorly. Making up for this are some quite astounding weapon models with quite astounding animations (the SAW still being my favorite in feel and design). An odd amalgamation to be sure. The environments are just as random, some indoor scenes are detailed, well lit, large, and designed to a tee, while others are bland, blocky, and blasted. One thing's for sure, whether hit or miss, each is very static. Lights are indestructible, walls cannot be shot through, smoking vehicles stay smoking, tables don't break, etcetera, etcetera. Realism? Sort of.   Can you tolerate dying instantly from grenades thrown by the entity called Chance? Does Counter-Strike lure you in with its batting eyes and succulence, but now fail to bring you to climax? Are you patient beyond reproach? If you answered yes to all three questions, America's Army is definitely for you. If not, then download it anyway.The beauty of a free game is that it's free. Ka-ching goes my paycheck. But, much like our freedom, it seems the price of literal pricelessness (in that there is no cost) is also eternal patience. I can change clich as I please. Ka-ching goes my paycheck.If you ask me, I can also find fault in free HBO, sex, lunches, and lunches preceded by sex and followed by free HBO. But I can also recognize and relish the positives within each of these activities. Such is the same with America's Army. Some parts are great, others not so. Enjoyment is based on personal preference. As its nature is directed to a very limited, cult, and belligerent audience, it does not cater to the casual. So, you must ask yourself, do you like sex, lunch, and free HBO?", "date": "Sep 20, 2002"}
