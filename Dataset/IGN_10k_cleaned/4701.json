The latest company on the diamond is Sorrent with Batter Up! by FOX Sports, an arcade-style hitting game that's more home run derby than baseball sim. Actually, it's all home run derby, no baseball sim.   Features:   Multiple batters and pitchers  In-game animations  Graduate to the majors   Batter Up! by FOX Sports is a very, very simple game. Now, we've long discussed how sometimes simple is best when it comes to handset games -- but this may be too simple. Sure, there is some strategy when it comes to deciding where to swing the bat, but beyond that, Batter Up! by FOX Sports is nothing more than a quickie ball game.   As the onset, you select from four available batters -- each with different levels of power and accuracy. Since the goal is to put 'em over the fence, you may need to choose an accurate batter if you're having trouble lining up hits. If you're timing is hot, but you're not good at guesswork, patch your hole with a power hitter.   Once in the game, you step up to the plate and start nailing homers. At least, you try to. There are nine positions in the on-screen batter's box. The pitcher throws the ball somewhere within that box. You need to quickly ascertain which of the nine positions -- assigned to the nine number keys -- to hold down and release in time to smash one into the parking lot.   Now, it's not all guesswork. As the ball screams toward the plate, two small ball outlines begin to converge to one location. If you can quickly figure out which position that is, hold down that key and release when the ball is over the plate.   Or, you can choose to play your instinct and begin by holding down a number key and hope the ball comes close to the corresponding position. If you're right -- BAM! -- it's outta there. If not, then you may have to settle for a single or double. And when it comes to scoring, singles and doubles ain't gonna get you in the majors -- which happens as you get better at swinging lumber.   Batter Up! by FOX Sports looks very nice with good player mug shots and detailed batter models. The fields are certainly realistic-looking. However, the best part of the game are the goofball animations that happen when you nail an awesome homer. Signs may be blasted, releasing a million sparks or a hot dog vendor in the stands will take one to the head. Good stuff. The crowd cheers when you nail a serious homer, and the opening screen is accompanied by a little jingle.As I mention in the review, there may be such a thing as too simple, and I think Batter Up! by FOX Sports approaches that level of simplicity. Considering the level of detail we're seeing in mobile sports games now, a simple home run contest like Batter Up! by FOX Sports may not satisfy baseball fans like a good sim. The excitement of nailing homers wears off quickly, despite the great animations that accompany huge hits. A fine distraction, but certainly not one that you'll keep for the entire season.", "date": "May 7, 2004"}
