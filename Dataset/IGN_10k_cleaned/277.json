{"name": "FreeSpace 2", "name_review": "Freespace 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/10/02/freespace-2", "text": "When the original Descent: Freespace hit the shelves last year, it was blasted by a lot of reviewers for following too close to the path already set by Origin with their Wing Commander series. While the game was technically sound and well designed, it didn't really offer anything that players hadn't seen before, and to make matters worse, its storyline was almost identical to that of Wing Commander Prophecy. But a lot has changed in the last year. Origin's iron grip on the space sim market has loosened quite a bit since the departure of Chris Roberts, who is still months away from finishing his first solo release. In the meantime, the designers at Volition have tucked themselves away to work on the sequel to Freespace. What they've come up with is a title that is not only technically excellent, but also boasts the creativity and depth that was lacking in the original release.  Let me start with a little background for those who aren't familiar with the original tale. In the last game, the Terrans teamed up with the their old enemies the Vasudans in order to combat a new race that was attempting to eliminate all life in the sector. The attacking race, designated the Shivans, were not only better armed, but their capital ships were protected with shielding that was nearly impossible for the Alliance to penetrate. Just before all hope was lost, the Alliance discovered the remnants of an civilization that had been destroyed by the Shivans 8000 years ago. While researching the ruins of the decimated civilization, which the Alliance was now calling the Ancients, scientists discovered a way to destroy the Lucifer, the Shivan's mothership. Unfortunately, while the destruction of this mighty ship broke the power of the Shivans in the sector, it also destroyed the jump gate back to Earth. Their civilization broken by decades of war, the Terrans were faced with the idea of having to rebuild far away from their original home.  As the second game begins, the Terrans and the Vasudans have put aside their differences, forged a more permanent Alliance and both set about reconstructing their civilizations. Sadly, not everyone felt that this was the best idea. A large group of Terrans calling themselves the Neo-Terran Front have rebelled and taken over three Alliance Systems. To make matters worse, there are still quite a few Shivan ships floating about causing all sorts of damage. Your job is to protect the Alliance from these and other attacks as they begin the long search for a way to return home. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to give more details about the path the story takes without ruining the game.  Each of the missions makes absolute sense within the larger picture that you're given. Early levels consist of scrambles and escort missions, but as the game progresses, you'll have plenty of chances to take out larger targets. One really nice thing about the way the game is set up is that your goals can actually change in the middle of a mission if strange things go down (and they will). If you perform well, you'll be assigned to new squadrons that will give you access to new ships and weapons. Better still, as you advance you'll get more of an idea of the secrets that the Alliance is keeping. In order to keep things moving, Volition has added a feature that allows players to skip any mission that they've failed five times. While this is definitely cheating (and cheaters never win), it's really nice when you run up against that one mission that you just can't seem to get the hang of. If you opt not to skip the mission, you'll be given the choice again each time you fail.  Gameplay is very similar to that of the original Freespace, which is to say, well designed but basically the same format that we've seen from every space fighter. You begin each mission with a quick and dirty briefing that will give you the basics of what to expect. Once you accept the mission, you're launched into space immediately to start taking care of business. Control is smooth and responsive and the game offers very nice sensitivity and dead zone settings for your joystick. One quirk that may take new players a little while to get used to is the huge number or keyboard commands -- but none of these are absolutely necessary, and the game comes with an extensive set of in-game tutorials that will get you up to speed in no time. These advanced controls, while hard to get used to, are extremely helpful in combat and allow you to instantly get a bead not only on your nearest enemy, but also nearby missiles, capital ship electrical systems and other targets as well. Fast action features like the missile countermeasures work pretty well, but I recommend that you bind the action key to one of your joystick buttons if you want to survive for more than a few outings. Once a mission is complete, your commanding officer will give you the word and you'll be allowed to open your jump gate to return to base. The one thing that Freespace 2 really does add to the genre is the feel of being a really tiny ship in a world of giants. All of the capital ships in the game are huge. Better still, these giant ships have access to beam weapons that can utterly destroy a tiny ship like yours with a single shot. In addition to watching out for the other side's enemy fighters, you'll have to stay out of the way of your own capital ships' fire or you'll get turned into paste. The entire effect is magnificent, giant craft blasting each other with weapons of unbelievable power and beauty while dozens of smaller craft buzz around trying to change the outcome.  Fortunately, you'll have quite a few different ships and weapons to give you an edge in combat. The first few ships you'll get your hands on, the Hercules, Medusa, and Perseus class, are all general class fighters that offer slight advantages in a specific area. The Hercules can take a pretty good beating and is great as a dogfighter for inexperienced pilots. The Medusa is a bomber, but carries enough firepower and speed to keep those just learning the rope from being shredded, and the Perseus is fast and nimble enough to get out of just about every situation. As the game wears on though, you'll get access to some ships that, while not as well rounded as your starting fighters, are far superior to these three craft in their specific spheres of influence. Weaponry ranges from basic xasers (which come in a couple of different forms) that are designed to do a solid amount of damage to an enemy's shields and internal armor, to weapons specifically designed to cripple a ship's subsystems without harming the craft itself (a la X-Wing's Ion Cannons). There are also a load of different missiles that range from the dumbfire Cyclops to the extremely lethal and quick Harpoons.   Where Freespace 2 really stands out is its mind-blowing visuals. Simply put, every ship, every stellar object, every surface in this game looks incredible. Ships move quickly and realistically, and when they're hit, they shower sparks and plasma behind in dazzling arcs as they spin out of control. Weapon effects, particularly the giant beam weapons fired from the capital ships are beautiful, and dynamically light up any objects close to them. Certain missile types fire as streak packs and leave a chaotic trail of particles behind them. The end result of all this going on at once is a startlingly attractive battlefield that will give you joy just to watch. This effect is enhanced by the game's plentiful sound effects and voice acting, which I found to be cut above what I'd heard before. The soundtrack is also movie quality and never gets in the way of your enjoyment of the game.  In a final analysis, there's no doubt that Freespace 2 is still very derivative of the games that came before it. What's different this time around is that Volition has added to the genre instead of just cloning it. If you're a fan of space combat games, you owe it to yourself to grab a copy of this game.
