Which is hardly a criticism, since the vast majority of all those Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games and spin-offs are nothing short of utterly brilliant. It's just that, after playing The World Ends With You, you'll wish the company would do more of this sort of thing, because it's really, really good. And in many ways it's a bit of a departure for the company. Having built its reputation as one of the world's leading publishers by building exotic new worlds, this game sees Square Enix cement it by entering the real world: Tokyo's fashionable Shibuya district, to be precise.   Waking up with no memories, Nekus only hint as to whats going on is the appearance of a mysterious timer on his hand.  Like the real thing, it's a bewildering place where you'll find yourself assailed by people and noise and incoming cellphone texts. Unlike the real thing, you'll also be inundated by the random thoughts of strangers, and a combination of sounds and sights that are all a bit reminiscent of Sega's cult classic, Jet Set Radio  which can only be a good thing. The game starts with your character, Neku, having woken up at the famous Shibuya crossing, discovering that he's only got seven days to live. Unfortunately, with no memories to go on, he must quickly make sense of his surroundings  made more complicated by the mysterious Game, being played by the even more mysterious Reapers  who hang around looking moody in hoodies, putting up invisible walls that restrict your movement till you follow their orders.    At the start of the game (and the Game), Neku finds himself outfitted with a pin (sometimes known to Brits as a badge), which allows him to see the meandering thoughts of Shibuya's many passers-by, as well as the nefarious noise  various freaky enemies that haunt the streets. Those streets aren't quite the same as the real Shibuya. The big brands that dominate the real-life urban cityscape have been replaced, so the Starbucks on the corner becomes the Outback caf; the famous 109 department store becomes the 104 building; and HMV becomes AMX. But the art direction does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the real thing, and in many ways, the game's utilisation of this real-world (ish) setting, is inspired, and one of its strongest points   Just like real life, shopping  and shopping well  is essential, so youll need to buy the right brands, eat the right foods, and so on.  There are brands that go in and out of fashion, to affect the strength of your items. Text messages alert you to your next objective. You'll need to comb the shops for new items  the right brands, for example, or the right foods to boost your stats. Your phone signal indicator tells you how much noise is in an area. And you can control Shibuya's inhabitants by planting memes in their minds. It captures every important element of today's high-speed, networked, fashion-conscious society. It also captures the isolation that sometimes lurks beneath the surface, because at the heart of the game is the sort of deep story and involved character development that Square Enix has made its hallmark. Neku's personal journey is every bit as important to the game as its funky new game mechanics and fancy art style. It's a journey from sulky teenager to socially adjusted (young) adult, and there are big themes, about companionship and seizing at what life has to offer (hinted at by the game's Japanese title, which translates as This Wonderful World).      That said, the funky new mechanics are every bit as excellent as the setting and story. The main basis of the game is exploration and combat  the latter, based on a collectable and customisable arsenal of pins that level up with use. But there is a multitude of neat little tricks and minor design innovations. You can adjust the difficulty level on the fly if you get stuck on any difficult bits; or your character level before combat to earn more experience or items. You can gain bonuses in combat by wearing or using fashionable items, and even shape those fashions by using those items. Your pins even earn experience points while your DS is shut down, providing you with a neat little present at the start of every play session. And there are a couple of cool multiplayer modes: Tin Pin Slammer is a modern riff on shove ha'penny, while Mingling allows you to power up your pins for every player you encounter in real life.    You can also use your psychic powers to manipulate Shibuyas residents, by planting memes and messing with their ouija games.  During exploration, the random thoughts of passers-by are excellent, lending background colour and variety to the game world (and departing from the usual RPG staple of having to chat to random NPCs). Every element of modern life is captured, from musings about how to attract girls and complaints about ill-fitting shoes, to thoughts about the latest blogs and hottest celebs. And during combat, a dual screen control scheme is wholly innovative. Indeed, it's so innovative that it takes a bit of getting used to at first. That's because you fight across both screens, controlling your partner on the top screen, using the d-pad to enter combos, and Neku on the bottom screen, using the stylus to enter various commands that depend on the pins he's wearing.    Those touchscreen inputs feel a bit approximate (the game often gets confused as to whether you're moving or attacking, for example), and trying to enter them at the same time as controlling the upper screen can get utterly chaotic at times  especially if you're trying to enter the right combinations in the top screen to trigger a combined Fusion attack  but you can automate the upper screen to help you get used to things, and you'll soon get the hang of controlling both to help you overcome all of the obstacles that the Reapers put in your path. Unfortunately, it's difficult to say too much about that path, or the game's story without giving too much away; and there are so many interlocking design features that it's difficult to do justice to the way they all come together.  During combat, you control both screens, and you can customise your attacks from a range of psychic powers that includes chucking cars around to impaling the enemy on frozen spikes. What can be said, however, is that The World Ends With You combines Squares hallmark character development and story with the collectability of Pokmon, and ties together innovative game design with the urban cool of Jet Set Radio. Indeed, the games appropriation of real-world themes and issues are at the heart of its success. Its a celebration of modern life, and like modern life, it can be messy, complicated and confusing, and you might find yourself beset by minor disappointments. But you get out what you put in, and at its heart is an important message about making human connections in a world that can sometimes seem harsh and uncaring. Which, when you think about it, is pretty cool. And if you dont want to think about it, well then you can just sit back and enjoy the game design.", "date": "Apr 8, 2008"}
