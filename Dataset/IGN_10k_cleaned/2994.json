Sure, I've been caught enraptured by a few along the way -- the original Dragon Warrior left me lost in its forgotten land and amongst its strange characters for a memorable duration. A few niche experiences here and there, maybe one or two really in-depth role-playing experiences to get a feeling of why the true RPG fanatics are into this stuff -- sure, that's good for any gamer. But these games have suddenly become THE big thing that everybody's wild about. Why? For the most part, you don't have the freedom in the pre-scripted adventure to actually play the role, and you don't get the character depth and excitement to beat simply reading a book. Not to mention that you're spending hours and hours pretending that menus are as exciting as action sequences...So when The Lord of the Rings began to come back as a hot property, I just shook my head knowing where the games would be going. And right away, we had kids writing in saying, ~Oh my god, this would make SUCH a great RPG!~ My questions back always was, ~How?~ How would a game with a story that we already know (two times over for most fans, considering how the movie brought Tolkien's novel to life in such a definitive way,) that certainly will not have the freedom from plot to let you explore Middle Earth as you'd want to in an RPG, that surely would not carry the depth of text of the novels, and that will (or may -- my apologies to all the genuine RPG enthusiasts in the world) bore you to tears with a bunch of menus instead of delivering real excitement ... how will that be fun? Vivendi Universal sought out to prove me wrong -- or at least answer my questions -- with this game.Features: Go on a quest with the complete Fellowship in your party Follows the original text of Tolkien's novel Only for Game Boy AdvanceThis was the game that you read about -- or rather, it's the Game Boy Advance version of it -- in all the brouhaha following the licensing of The Lord of the Rings. EA has the rights to the movies, Vivendi Universal (now publishing under the name Black Label Games) got the book rights. EA went for an action/adventure game to follow the thrill-a-minute-for-200-minutes film. Black Label went for a more inclusive version of Tolkien's text, with characters not in the movie and a more in-depth telling of the story. EA's game is still in development, so we'll have to see how far that one goes in capturing the tale. Black Label's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring -- arguably the more challenging and time-consuming game to develop -- is already done and in our hands. More material, more comprehensive game design, yet less time to have made it happen? Before I even started the quest, I had a feeling that this game wasn't going to give me a good answer to my question.And for the most part, so it went. Things fell apart piece by piece in the game, and developer Pocket Studios held on for as long as they could, but it all goes back to the fact that The Lord of the Rings is very difficult material to fashion into an RPG. The novels (yes, I read those monster books) were exciting (to everybody besides AD&D nerds -- they liked all the baddies and weirdoes) because of the characters and exciting action. And pretty much right away, those two started slipping.I think maybe the developers got too clever for their own good when it came to integrating characters and story. Some of the puzzle designs are quite crafty, and bring in elements of the novels. The boot thief puzzle gag is brilliant, and the way that little Simon Says music puzzles keep showing up reminds players of Tolkien's constant breaks for poetry and lore (the music puzzles even match up to the book, such as when the elves found in Bag End ask Frodo to memorize a song.) On the other hand, while the detail work is impressive, the main story doesn't have the same kind of care. The midnight flight from Bree becomes a simple gate puzzle, while your encounters with the Ringwraiths aren't interactive -- for example, you can wander on and off the road as much as you want and only get punished with a short text when Dark Riders are in the way, and in your first encounter with Sauron's black henchmen, you don't even get to put the ring on (in general, the ring is just an inventory bauble that turns itself on at key story encounters -- boo!)You just don't get a great feel for the story since the storytelling is uninspired. The design team went a short way towards the goal of getting players into the story by having lots of letters to deliver (thus giving you characters to look out for), and there are some good character moments (one character who was off the road spoke of voices ... seconds later, you encounter a Ringwraith) and other means of interacting with characters. But when it comes to major encounters, again, the Fellowship story just doesn't get told. Granted, they had a TON to work into the game here, but it seems like the dev team was more concerned (or maybe too pressured by the fans and experts) with getting in every character and encounter, at the expense of the main characters and key story sequences. I get to meet every single Brandybuck, Bolger and Took in the Shire, yet I never in the adventure get to really see Samwise's craven and overemotional character, or hang out for much of Tom Bombadil's frivolity? I didn't expect everything in the 500-page novel to make this 20-hour game, but some important elements just didn't translate even in an abridged form.The bottom line between all of this is that, since the story doesn't come across very strong -- the gameplay has no clock on heated or critical events, so there's never tension, and the intense character moments didn't make the script text. It's not the kind of game that'd enthrall people who haven't read the novels (and since the movie glances over most minor characters, they don't have much chance there either.) On the other hand, people who are familiar with the text get the signpost tour of Middle Earth and get little of the thrill and life of the novel. Either way, what's the point?Even if the story had been told well, I doubt this game would have been a joy to play. The gameplay is both rushed to completion and spoiled to begin with. The battle sequences are a painful waste of time. The instantaneous battle sequences don't work as they should, so the camera has to cut out and then back in to start a fight (thus losing a lot of pacing and yet giving you nothing new to look at.) The entire Fellowship can stand in battle, but the multiple character battles become more of a drudgery than it'd seem -- from the beginning, enemies get the jump on you with the first attack, and since there can be several enemies on screen, it can take a long time for your turn to come up. Then you have to watch every swipe of battle, which all begin and end with the characters taking a LONG walk across the screen to attack and then retreat -- just the time that it takes for sprites to rotate back into the ready position is enough time for you to lose interest. Your party will also take hits even though you're ready to lay out some serious pain. Luckily, the designers didn't randomize battles -- better yet, when they're dead, they're dead and you can go back and explore -- but there's no visual stimulation or great excitement to make battles a thrill.There's some screwy stuff in the controls -- Frodo and his Fellowship ~drive~ strangely. Moving a character sometimes feels like steering a car, especially when they get caught on a wall and suddenly go wherever they want to. There's also some flubbing in the context events that makes playing a chore. There are times where you'll buy an item without actually wanting to because the game confused you're wanting to check a price with wanting to put money down. Characters sometimes don't pop up their option for dialog when they're supposed to, so you have to circle them and button-mash the talk button to see if they're speaking commands aren't working or if they just feel like being quiet. Puzzles have the same problem -- I spent five minutes trying to put acorns through a hoop, trying to fight the menu into doing what I wanted.Whether it was a rush job or just the result of unskilled RPG design(many try, but very few studios have the kind of puzzle craftsmanshipand storytelling to make a really great RPG) is kind of up in the air,but in the end, this first chapter of The Lord of the Ringsis arough start for the journey. I think there's still plenty of promise -- I likethat the battles are meant as landmarks for your quest rather than justfiller, and that you don't have to battle for experience (EP insteadgets doled out at different points of the quest after you've donesomething or earned a reward, and it's often character-specific as faras who gets a prize according to either the story or the gameplay.) Whatthey can't do is just drag players on a connect-the-dots tour of thestory without letting you feel a significant encounter when you get toeach dot. There's a good sequence where your friends get abducted by theOld Willow and have to call on Tom Bombadil for help (who's more in themood for playing games.) Contrast that with scene in Bree, where playerscould have had more back-and-forth with the trusting barkeep Butterbur(in the book, he kind of does them favors.) Events that take place in character's minds don't make the game -- it makes me wonder how they'll make the ending of the last book, since it's mostly Frodo freaking out over the horrors he's experienced on the way back from what should have been a hero's victory...Then there's the TERRIBLE fight sequences -- the book's magic may not be as flashy and constant as a Final Fantasy game, but at least the hack-and-slash could havebeen more engrossing. But that's its own problem...When I saw the movie, so much of what I read in the book ages ago came flooding back. When I played the game, I expected the same thing to happen. But the storytelling wasn't there -- not only was I not remembering things from the books, but even elements that I had seen in the movie not long ago left me confused. There's not a cut scene until the second half of the game, and even that break for story make enough sense to do anything but remind novel readers that something sort of like that happened at that point of the book. I'm not sure how people who haven't experienced the book will get what's going on. The game is not just not taking enough from Tolkien's spirit -- they've got all of the stuff, but not enough of the pacing and passion. I'd say that Samwise is sobbing, but I don't think anybody who's played the game would get it.", "date": "Oct 1, 2002"}
