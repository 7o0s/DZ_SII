That would be the editor of the music channel, Spence ~Dookie~ Abbott. From day one, he has espoused the greatness of Root Beer Tapper because, well, he has only played about 7.5 games in his whole life, and he must have played this one in college while seriously bakedor something. Sadly, he isn't around during the writing of this review, but it's no matter. It's likely his response to the game would be something like, ~Dude. That's awesome. Root Beer Tapper. Again. Sweet. Best game of all time. Balls, man. Balls.~ And so forth. We like Spence; he's crazy.   Drink like an old-school dude without getting drunk. His love for Root Beer Tapper is well founded. The original arcade game, issued in 1983, was unique because of its game design, but also because of the unusual use of the joystick. Players would push down on the stick to pour a root beer from the tap. It seems like a simple concept, but the mechanical motion felt just right and back in 1983 everything was simple. Thanks to Digital Eclipse, the core development team responsible for so many ancient arcade conversions on Xbox Live Arcade, the controls work nearly identically to the arcade game from 24 years ago.   Digital Eclipse has handled this port differently from the rest of the XBLA games we've seen. We're not exactly sure why -- it's either because of critical reviews or Microsoft's loosening of the XBLA restrictions -- but Root Beer Tapper is a Spartan affair that does just exactly what it's supposed to and nothing more. It feels just right -- mechanically right. First, the analog sticks in the XBLA conversation are perfect. The left stick moves your character, a soda jerk who looks conspicuously like a tall Mario, left or right down an aisle of kegs. It also moves him up or down the four lanes to collect tips. The right analog stick is used to pour the beer. Press down to fill a bubbling mug of root beer, and then send it to the hungry crowd down the aisle in one swift motion. This mechanic made the game work so well in the 1980s and it's re-creation makes it work again on Xbox Live Arcade.    Craig Harris, IGN's resident coin-op buff, said this when he played the game, ~Finally they did it. They re-created the analog movement of the original. Cool.~ There you have it. Even though Spence wasn't around to applaud this fundamental design choice, another IGN staffer, knowledgeable in the arts of the ancients, was there to declare this version of Root Beer Tapper a success.    Buy the $5 version or spend $344 on one of these babies. So, the controls work well. Root Beer Tapper is really nothing more than a mini-game. Its original design was a full arcade unit, but in 2007, this type of game ends up being part of larger games like Jak and Daxter or Leisure Suit Larry or what have you. Apparently, even Midway has packaged this game with 11 others in a stand-up arcade unit. But for $5 (400 MS points)? This is an easy and smart purchase. The original game still holds its own as a fun getaway from the drudgeries of life by presenting a challenging set of levels that require skill, timing, and experience in order to simply get past the second level. And for some reason, the root beer in this arcade game makes me thirsty, and I hate root beer. Something about those foaming glasses of elixir   The game features the basic arcade set-up with the guessing mini-game built in. If you're familiar with it, you can still collect tips, move down rows to collect the empty glasses, and you'll still have to be wary of not sending mugs to customers watching the dancing show. Like most games at the time, the whole concept is based on how far you can go and how many points you can collect. Each customer type served has a point value (50, 100, 150), with higher points given to unusual characters, and the highest points given to collecting tips. The guessing mini-game in between levels rewards the correct guesser with 3,000 points. Achievements are smartly delegated, with a few easy ones collectible for passing the first level, etc., a few given to co-op games, while others are attributed to the versus games.   Back in the high life again. Root Beer Tapper can be played in co-op and versus online in player and ranked matches. The online game essentially pits players against each other in a race to see who can get the highest points before losing all their lives. While playing online, you won't see the other person actually playing. You'll only see their point total building in the upper right-hand corner. While not that interactive, this works out pretty well because the game isn't affected by online lag in the least. The custom and create-a-game offerings are meager, consisting of two mere options: picking co-op or versus play. But it's no big matter; Digital Eclipse didn't force the matter. It enabled people to play the game online without creating lag or messing up the original design. The co-op game is rather simplistic: it hardly feels like you're playing with anyone at all, but there are a few Achievements built into it, so at least there is that challenge.   Like the re-creation of the game proper, the graphics haven't been messed with much either. Interestingly, there is no option to pick between old school or ~new, updated~ graphics, and honestly, we kinda like that option. The music is exactly like the original as well.", "date": "Feb 8, 2007"}
