It's been tough going for people like us, though, with World of Warcraft blowing the doors off the online competition and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion dominating our offline eyeballs (not to mention all the stuff going on in the handheld space). So it was with guarded relief that I peeled open a copy of Hard Truck Apocalypse. It's obviously action-oriented, but that's not a problem as long as it's fun, am I right? And certainly doesn't hurt that the box copy boasts things like, ~Uncover secrets of the lost civilization, gain powerful friends, and destroy all that stand in your way.~ Rawr! Let's get it on!Unfortunately, the getting had yet to be initiated, even a dozen hours or so into this game. The game's pacing can best be described as ~glacial,~ which is unfortunate when there are so many explosions and flying crap on the box. Sure, it's advertising and is subject to some, ah, creative representation of the game, but it's been a long time for me since the delta between box and game was so wide. In practice, the overwhelming majority of our ~gameplay~ consists of holding down the ~W~ key. The world of HTA apparently lost the knowledge of cruise control in the wake of a global thermonuclear war that has made every character in the game accustomed to wearing masks (a conceit that conveniently obviates the need to animate people's faces when they talk). There's a lot of ~W~ key going on because the game is apparently 99% terrain and 1% Point of Interest. In between the incredibly spaced-apart towns and villages you'll encounter random people driving around, most of whom want to kill you. The portion that don't tended to serve as an unintentionally hilarious example of the game's fascinating approach to AI pathing.  But it's not just that the towns and villages are spattered in miserly manner throughout each zone. A complicating factor is the speed at which you move, which feels about 30 miles per hour. Also, the compass map cannot be zoomed in or out, and it's default scaling is virtually useless, so you have to constantly swap between the screen-filling map and the game itself. Unfortunately, this kills the ~W~ input each time. If you swap to the map and back while the ~W' key remains pressed, you will putter to a halt in a few moments. So, W, map, W, map, W, map, and this how you make your way laboriously from one largely arbitrary location to another. And while the game is technically competent, featuring fairly well detailed vehicle models, solid character models, a far clipping plane and some occasionally interesting natural formations, the wilderness is largely barren. In ten minutes of W, map, W, map, W, map, you may encounter two or three random clusters of oddly bloodthirsty road brigands, but other than that, it's brown hills, clumps of forest, a river or two, and a few gun emplacements in the middle of the road that also shoot first and ask questions later.If the sheer tedium of playing the game wasn't enough, the much-trumpeted combat model is disappointingly simplistic. Your typical strategy won't get much more complex than driving in a circle while holding down the mouse button that fires your gun. There's no way to target specific vehicle mechanisms, little in the way of arsenal variety, and nothing more than poorly-aiming kamikaze opponents between you and the next town. Your guns never run out of ammunition, but they do need to be reloaded, and constant repairs and refueling will be an irritating money sink for the first several hours of the game. You can do bounty missions, where those random brigands get prices put on their heads for a few minutes, but often the repair cost incurred in fighting them outweigh the bounty you get from killing them.There is a story here, but I struggle to get myself interested in it. It kicks off with a fire back at the ranch, while you're doing your first basic FedEx mission, and your adopted father is found dying in the dirt, with your childhood home going up in flames. Sadly, our main character elicits no emotion about the man who raised him from birth and now lays dying, and zero curiosity about whomever it was that just destroyed his home and killed his adoptive father. So to say that there are some holes in the plot would be diplomatic. From there, you're sent on a wild goose chase to track down your real father, and the whole escapade is marred by (1) poor translation from Russian, (2) those facial masks, and (3) a pervasive sense of dull duty rather than, you know, fun. In the end, HTA is succeeds as a demonstration of how good a budget title can look, rather than succeeding as a compelling experience.", "date": "Jul 18, 2006"}
