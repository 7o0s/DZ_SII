{"name": "Gem Smashers", "name_review": "Gem Smashers", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/12/04/gem-smashers", "text": ", the most recent GBA release from publisher Metro 3D (Wings and Aero the Acrobat), really surprised me. From first glance at the box art, the game looks like every typical budget GBA puzzler you've never heard of, the ones that sit on the bottom rack or behind the Mario and Metroid boxes. So sitting down to review the title, I wasn't going in with much expectations. Luckily, the game turned out to be not only a decent play, but one of the most original puzzle games on the GBA so far.  Features: 60 levels in Arcade Mode Over 100 levels in Story Mode Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save  The first effort from European developers Frame Studios, Gem Smashers is all about bouncing around like an Arkanoid ball, dodging and then bouncing some more. If you select the Story Mode, we learn that an evil doctor (who comes off as a cross between Dr. Wily, Dr. Robotnik and every other crazy, moustached degree-holder) and his clunky robot have crash-landed on a peaceful, foresty planet...and immediately decided to start messing things up. They've sucked up all the energy the planet has to offer, trapping it in little gems. It is your job, as one of three fuzzy little creatures of varying skills, to venture out into your world and release the energy (which looks like more fuzzy little creatures) from these gems.  How do you do this? By bouncing frantically up and down, of course, smashing each gem open along the way. The world of Gem Smashers, like Bust-A-Move is made up of single screens filled with colorful little blocks and blobs. Your creature hurtles itself upward until it hits a block, then immediately back downward. Where you come in is guiding your creature left and right so that it hits the blocks you're after, and misses the ones you're not. Yes, this is a game that (menus aside) is controlled entirely by pressing left or right on the D-Pad. But somehow, in play this doesn't seem as simple or 1-dimensional as it sounds.   Each level is filled with gems of various colors, which your creature must bump into in order to set free the animals inside. However, you can only crack open gems the same color as your little guy. So most levels boil down to unlocking a few gems, then searching for little colored bowls that will change your tone, allowing you to unlock more gems. These bowls are usually hidden (depending on your player) in rocks or tumbleweed-like objects that crumble after a few strikes. So what's so hard about a game where all you do is bounce into things? It's the dealy little objects the developers have scattered about each level that do you in.   Strewn among the other objects are hazards such as little skull blocks that kill you upon contact, as well as arrow blocks which in jarring effect, reverse your controls temporarily. There are also quite a few fun objects to aide you, like dynamite triggers, little wrecking balls and even something that slows your bouncing down to a float. Unlock all the gems and find the exit door before time runs out, and you move onto the next level. The developers have obviously given a lot of thought to what powerups and challenges make a good puzzle game interesting, and everything on your board is not only logical but play well off each other.   What makes the game so challenging is that you're doing all this bouncing in such a small area. That gem you're aiming for might be surrounded by three deadly skull blocks and quite frequently you'll find yourself bouncing across the entire screen for one gem, only to hit the wrong color bowl and have to bounce all the way back again. So you have to be constantly thinking not just 'where am I going?' but also 'which blocks am I going to be bouncing off along the way?' Strategies such as rolling down the sides of objects or hitting gems at an angle are essential to completing each level intact. And at the end of each world in Story Mode, you get to battle a large boss whose weakness is usually color-related.   It must be mentioned that Gem Smashers is a very pretty game. While the in-game sprites aren't much to write home about (there's not all that much you can do with a 16x16 block), your hefty character sprite at the right of the screen, which indicates your present color, is well-detailed and adorable (very similar to those in the SNES title Tetris Attack). Presentation on this game is just wonderful. From cinema scenes, to menus that play with sprite rotation and manipulation, even a multi-layered level select screen with hovering clouds; this game is polished. You rarely see this level of presentation in 3rd party GBA titles and I'd say this is on par with any puzzler Nintendo has given us itself.   Both songs and sound effects work well and while there's not a huge variety, the voice samples and music match the gameplay. The game isn't without its flaws, though. When you begin a game in Story Mode, you won't be given access to save until you blow through all the early levels and the boss first. After that point you can thankfully save as much as you want, but if you're starting a game on 'Normal' or 'Hard' you might find yourself playing the first few levels several times to get to that first save. Additionally, every time you unlock a gem, the creature inside flies up at the screen with a little help from the GBA's sprite rotation and scaling abilities. This looks swell, but when you're blasting through five or six gems at once, and they're all the same color as your character, it's easy to get temporarily lost in the crowd.  Gem Smashers came out of nowhere, and I really hope more people pick it up because it's a very original GBA title that for once doesn't feel rushed, or filled with bugs. The bouncing idea might not have worked well enough on its own, but Frame Studios' careful choices for items, powerups and hazards give the game a wonderful balance. Boss battles are similar to, and as much fun as they were in Warioland 4. And playing against your friend with a link cable is a blast. If the idea of this gameplay interests you, you likely won't be let down because everything in this game has been handled as well as it possibly could have. This title is another under-the-radar charmer the likes of Denki Blocks and considering you can find it in many stores for under $15, it's certainly worth tracking a copy down.", "date": "Dec 4, 2003"}
