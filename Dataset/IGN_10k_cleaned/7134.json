Breaking through the pack is tougher than beating Tiger on a good day. With familiar game play mechanics (many mobile golf games play remarkably similar), Abandon Mobile's NBC Sports Real Golf enhances the presentation side of its sim golfer to make an impression. To go along with its touted realistic golf action, the developer has grafted real world photography to accompany its virtual golf course.   The effect is actually quite surprising. The photo-realistic backdrops may not have a direct impression on the game mechanics, but they immediately set it apart from its competition. When you finish selecting your club and angle from an overview map, the game switches to the view of a photographed golfer standing on a real green. The effect isn't entirely convincing -- it looks a little like the green screen effect you see when reporters file ~on location~ stories on The Daily Show. But the clarity of the photography, from the golfer to the lush forest backdrops and blew skies, is instantly appealing.   As you move up the course, Real Golf clicks through different photo backdrops to approximate where you stand on the fairway. Some photos line up better than others. When you make that first drive, you can see a great shot of the fairway stretches out into the distance. However, in one instance I laid a shot right next to a sand trap, but after choosing my club and angle from the overview, the photographed backdrop revealed no sand trap. The problem is that because the game puts so much emphasis on its photo-realism, seeing a photo that doesn't even roughly match up with your current location is immediately jarring. It forces you to register, ~Hey, that's not where I'm standing.~ The effectiveness of the visual technique crumbles until you see the next uncanny photograph that is a near-perfect match, but once you've seen the bad match, you find yourself looking for it on every subsequent shot. What was once cool is now distracting.   Real Golf offers a quick play to get your toes wet and a full tournament. Developer Lucky Chicken adds in a two-player quick play game (basic pass-the-phone action) that's a nice touch. The tournament is an eighteen-hole contest against a field of made-up golfers that show little mercy, so it's advised that you practice up on each hole using the quick play game.   The game uses some tried-and-true golf game mechanics, such as the meter system for choosing shot power and accuracy. You have wind meters, club selectors, and a series of gradient lines to reveal the slope of the putting green. However, Real Golf adds two levels of customization that I think fans will appreciate. When you start a game, you can choose the course conditions from ~wet and slow~ to ~firm and fast.~ You can also choose from a series of clubs, each rated by power, control, backspin, and putter.   Lucky Chicken has included an unlockable 19th hole for champions and commentary from NBC sports announcer Dan Hicks, but these extra goodies don't make up for an additional problem with Real Golf -- lack of content. Full price download with only one course? I'm afraid that doesn't cut in the value-conscious mobile market.NBC Sports Real Golf is an adequate golf game that relies heavily on its photo-realistic presentation, but as soon as you spot that first ~inaccurate~ image, it becomes something you're constantly looking for. I found it distracting after a while -- strange that a game would almost invite you to look for problems rather than do everything it can to obscure them. Also missing: Additional modes besides a basic quick play or a full tournament. Where's the putting contest? And only one course? That's just not enough right now. The basic mechanics are acceptable and the ability to choose club sets and course conditions are fine additions. However, there are better golf games in the field, such as Gameloft's Vijay. And EA Mobile has an edition of Tiger on the way, too, that had five courses in our preview build -- something to think about before making a purchase.", "date": "Aug 18, 2006"}
