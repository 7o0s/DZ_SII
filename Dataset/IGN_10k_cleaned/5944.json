Built on trial-and-error games such as Dragon's Lair, Flashback, and Out of This World, Exoddus takes Abe and his enslaved friends on a journey of goofier magnitudes and more complex communications than its predecessor.  Cast with a zoo of bizarre characters, almost all of whose favorite past time is to injure, torture, or brutalize the loveable Mudokons, Exoddus features similar if not exactly the same gameplay found in the first Oddworld title  2D platforming.   Packed with a slew of puzzled-packed levels, all based on Abe's ability to rescue his newly enslaved cohorts, Exoddus displays an intriguing mix of communication aspects (i.e. Abe talking to his friends) with traditional platform gameplay. Abe must run from level to level turning dials, calming (or in some cases slapping) his associates, and sneaking around the torture chambers/brew houses of the Glukkons freeing them from their awful chores.   What are those new chores, you ask? The Glukkon's apparently captured a number of Mudokons and are using them to dig up Mudokon-ancestors' bones for their fine, fine SoulStorm brew. They have also strapped them up and implemented an excellent tear-inducing torture process, because after all, tears are the other essential ingredients in Glukkon's beloved brew.   The new game looks much like the first game, but it is packed with even more exotically textured environments than the first, and more movies than before. The 3D characters are better looking than the previously iteration, and more animated backgrounds and moving parts liven up the slightly old formula.   Abe's also is filled with more of what the first game was so loved for, new characters. In this case, most of them are hateful Mudokon-killers, but they're evil in such as way that you'll love to hate them. The new characters include Fleeches, Greeters, Slurgs, Slogs, Flying Sligs, and Sloggies. The old favorites have returned, and include Scrabs, Paramites, and Sligs. What's great is that you can now possess Scrabs and Paramites, and you can possess Glukkons to command Sligs to do your dirty work as well. The thrill of it all!  Abe's is neither analog nor dual shock compatible. But it really doesn't need it since the game is essentially a side-scrolling platformer. Exoddus is also two-player, which is a nice touch in the depth department, but this feature is not much more interesting than the single-player game.Abe's Exoddus is a game that delivers a strange standard in gameplaying. It takes the platform character paradigm and lifts it into a bizarre land of its own, complete with a unique communication scheme, an oftentimes annoying trial-and-error system, and a troupe of grotesquely cute and endearing characters. But what makes the game any better than Heart of Darkness or Dragon's Lair? Amazingly enough, it's the devilishly lovable characters who can talk to each other in many more ways than before. In an ass-backward kind of way, the game is tremendously rewarding, too. You'll have to repeat the same steps over and over again to get from point A to point B that will make you feverishly happy just to complete a small section. I was awfully frustrated with Abe's at first. But as I got to grips with the many audible commands, I really started falling in love. As much as goofing around with characters is a pleasure, however, I have to say the gameplay doesn't vary much more than the first game, and the same trial-and-error scheme is frustrating as a thorn in your heel. Several areas simply leave you stranded and you must start over again, a sign of poor design. So yeah, you are forced to get good  the object, anyway  but along the journey, it's more than just frustrating, it's agonizing. Some times, you'll simply want to quit altogether. Another bad sign. Nonetheless, like the character-rich Monster Rancher and the deep AI of PC game Creatures 2, the world of Abe is so gorgeously created and easy to dive into and the creatures so lovable, you will find Exoddus difficult to put down because of its charm. In the end, Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus is not just a cult game, it's bigger and better than that. But many people will be turned off with the die-until-you-don't game design and its unforgiving approach. Hopefully, the goofy ways of the hilarious Mudokons and their story will compel you to play on until the very end. But if you're not immediately swept away with Abe's Exoddus, then just don't buy this game. While it's not for everyone, those who favor it, will love it to death.", "date": "Dec 1, 1998"}
