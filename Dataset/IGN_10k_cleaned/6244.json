There's something pretty relaxing about being able to take your time and build up a healthy business and watch it flourish. Tycoon titles tend to range from the hardcore business management sims down to more creatively centered titles that have to do with entertainment properties like RollerCoaster Tycoon. The latter often have management options, but the focus is on creating an environment that will appeal to customers looking to have a good time. They tend to be a little simpler, more family friendly, and put an emphasis on creating fun through colorful visuals and exciting customization options. Marine Park Empire has what it takes to create a pretty healthy atmosphere to have some fun. It's not the best in the business, but for the price point, there's a lot of game to be had.   I wasn't expecting much out of this budget title. Most games that come in at 20 bucks don't usually end up being decent. Thankfully, I can say that Marine Park Empire is actually a fairly good value. With it comes Zoo Empire, a title from last year that provides the same type of gameplay, but on dry land. Like most titles of this ilk, Marine Park Empire challenges players to build up or renovate a theme park until it's profitable or has completed a certain number of objectives. Objectives are easy enough to understand and parks are easy enough to build. Anyone with any range of tycoon skills should be able to pick this one up and play.    Zoo Empire allows players to build all manner of enclosures for land animals along with some fresh water amphibious creatures like alligators using free-form deformation tools to sculpt the landscape and provide interesting enclosures. The marine additions are pretty similar though now you can dig a hole and fill it up with salt water as well in order to create some terrific enclosures for your water animals. Likewise, players can choose to build an above ground tank that can be extended to any height to create the correct depth of water for each animal.   As with Zoo Empire, constructing the perfect enclosure for your animal is pretty simple because of some very rigid rules for what will make an animal happy. They want a certain percentage of different terrain types (sand, rough sand, sea moss, brown rock, etc)  along with different types of plants, rocks, and equipment to keep the water clean. Those strict guidelines make it pretty easy to outfit a tank, but also create a pretty easy game.   Yeah, you still have to make sure to keep park guests happy and spending money, but that's also pretty damn easy. Just make sure there are places to eat food, go to the bathroom, buy gifts and so on. Yes, there will always be complainers walking around your park yelling that there aren't enough benches or trashcans even though your park has them every few feet, but for the most part, it's hard to lose a challenge as long as you're not completely stupid about the whole thing.   As it was with Zoo Empire, the interface is still a bit complex for what's ultimately a pretty simple game. You'll have to wade through several screens of information to eventually find the bit that you really need in order to make the right decision. None of the icons are very clear so it's really just a matter of learning how to navigate the mess. It has to be a tricky balance between providing so much information and making it accessible. I think for much of it, I would have just preferred larger screens full of text and numbers instead of cramming it into the one interface box at the bottom of the screen.   Marine Park Empire also only provides play at 1024x768 or 800x600, which is pretty unheard of in this day and age of PC gaming. Sure, a lot of the people that are going to buy this type of game are going to have lower grade computers, but it sucks to have a great machine and not be allowed to use it to its full potential. As it is, the visuals suffer a bit. They're cute and fun as they're supposed to be in a game like this, but the detail is certainly lacking. Cartoony people and animals are nice to see and play around with, but there aren't any exceptional examples of this style of game art to shout about.Marine Park Empire isn't the best example of a tycoon game that I can think of, but it's not even close to awful. In fact, it can be pretty fun, largely because of its simplicity. You don't necessarily have to worry much about losing and can instead focus on creating a fun park full of great exhibits and interesting design. The fact that you get Zoo Empire with it in one package for 20 bucks is hard to underplay. For the money, it's a terrific value.", "date": "Oct 30, 2005"}
