This river tubing action title wasn't that much fun to play, especially with the funky controls the designers put in the machine. And when you get a bad port of a lackluster game to begin with, well, it's time to ask yourself, ~why bother in the first place?~ That's what we got from Midway on the Game Boy Color.  Features Multiple rivers with different difficulties High score save, deleted at power off. Only for Game Boy Color  To give you a good idea of what Toobin' is like, the best thing to do is go right to the original  the arcade game. In Toobin', you're on an inner tube cruising along flowing rivers like the Yukon, Nile, Amazon, and the Colorado. Even though you're at the mercy of the currents at your butt, you still have full control  by paddling your left hand or right hand, you can maneuver yourself through the water to get between hazards and to pick up bonus items for points. Sometimes you'll have tree branches, logs, animals, and other obstacles that'll put your tube out of commission, so luckily you've got cans at your disposal. It's not really a statement on ecology, but to take out things in your way, you can hurl empty Coke cans to eliminate the threatening sharp thingies.  The arcade game also put you up against another inner tube guy, and you both worked your way through the same river, bumping into each other to make the way a little more difficult. Whether it's a one player game or two player game, the other guy was always there to make life on the river a bit more challenging.  Even with all these elements, the game never did much in the arcades. There really wasn't much in the form of payoff, other than collecting floating ~TOOBIN~ letters to win a T-shirt. It was a game that seemed to have a point as well as a beginning, middle, and end  but in the long run it just went on forever without any real substance. You kept going from one river to the next until you lost all your lives.  This Game Boy Color rendition is just a poor attempt at recreating a boring arcade game. There's nothing wrong with the graphics and music  in fact, the game looks and sounds great. There are a few sprite problems that definitely shouldn't be there, but all in all the artists did a great job rebuilding the animations and backgrounds from the arcade version of the game.  No, the real problem is in the actual gameplay.  The worst part of about Toobin  is, hands down, the controls. Granted, the original controls are nearly impossible to emulate on the Game Boy Color's control pad, but they could have done a MUCH better job.  To actually move your character, you have to rotate your tube and then paddle forward in the direction you're pointing  figure it as a game of Asteroid but you have to ~taptaptap~ the controller to get your ship to turn. And  for some odd reason, the developers forgot to put a way to paddle backwards, which is a major part of the gameplay  if you miss a gate or a bonus item, you're supposed to be able to just paddle back to grab what you missed. Can't do that here. Heck, I've found myself stuck between two objects simply because I couldn't paddle backwards  and in one case, it was a bug that forced me to turn off the system to get out of it.  But the controls aren't the only problems. The collision detection routines are some of the worst implemented in a game  you can pass right over an item or through a gate, and it will refuse to register the points. Sure, it's an occasional glitch, but it's something that shouldn't be there. And unlike the arcade game, the rivers in the Game Boy Color game have no currents to give the game a sense of randomness. The water's just one long stretch of blah and yawn.  Let's not forget the lack of two-player support. Heck, let's not forget that there's not even another innertube guy on the river, computer controlled or not.  It's obvious that it was always planned, since there's a location on the lower right for the other person's score. The game changes without this guy getting in your way, and really makes the game just a pointless task with no real challenge. Chalk another game up to a ~could've been somewhat good with two player support.~    I love the classics, but I never cared for Toobin'. And I absolutely don't care for Toobin'  if it was an exact port of the arcade game, it would have gotten a 5.0 at most. With the terrible controls, lack of water currents, and gameplay glitches, that knocks a few points off the score. It's not the worst Game Boy Color game, but it is one of most pointless.", "date": "May 25, 2000"}
