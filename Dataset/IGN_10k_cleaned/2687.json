My second reaction was, ~Why hadn't anyone thought of this before?~ The idea is flawless. You'll get the older crowd who grew up watching the Hulkster tear it up on Saturday morning, and the younger crowd, who's currently watching Hollywood Hulk Hogan thrill audiences in the WWE.   With such a solid concept, the only things needed to pull it off were a solid wrestling engine, a good career mode, and decent graphics. Legends of Wrestling doesn't necessarily deliver on all counts, but it does have two major things going for it: a healthy dose of nostalgia and a big heap of fun.  This game has already been out on the PS2 for awhile, and you might of read our review of it on IGN PS2. No doubt the review that follows will be lighting up the IGN Boards with comments like ~How come it got higher on the Xbox and GameCube sites when it's basically the same game?~ Well, my dear friends... different reviewers, different reviews.  I liked Legends of Wrestling. I liked the overall presentation, I liked the variety of wrestlers, I liked the combo/counter system, and to some degree, I liked the graphics. Sure, it could be deeper overall, but it certainly does a lot more right than wrong in my book.  For starters, the array of former (and some current) stars is truly remarkable. While I would have liked to see Hacksaw Jim Dugan, Rowdy Roddy Piper, The Ultimate Warrior or Jake the Snake, the list of assembled talent reads like a who's who of wrestling down the decades. These wrestlers are available right off the bat:  Hulk Hogan Jimmy ~Superfly~ Snuka Road Warrior Hawk Road Warrior Animal Bret ~Hitman~ Hart The Iron Sheik Terry Funk Don Muraco Jerry ~The King~ Lawler George ~The Animal~ Steele ~Mr. USA~ Tony Atlas Ricky ~The Dragon~ Steamboat Nikolai Volkoff Ted Dibiase Tito Santana Koko B. Ware One Man Gang Greg ~The Hammer~ Valentine Haley Race Dynamite Kid ~Flyin'~ Brian Pillman ~Superstar~ Billy Graham ~Hot Stuff~ Eddie Gilbert Rick Martel Ivan Putski ~Cowboy~ Bob Orton The Sheik Kerry Von Erich Kevin Von Erich Rob Van Dam   In addition, you can unlock the following dudes. Head over to IGN Codes to figure out how):  Captain Lou Abano David Von Erich Michael Von Erich  Fritz Von Erich Dory Funk Ivan Koloff Jimmy Hart King Kong Bundy Mr. Fuji Ricky Morton Robert Gibson Sabu  The game has good presentation throughout. From the starting movie to the menus, the game is easy to get into, easy to navigate, and easy on the eyes. Acclaim has employed a unique, cartoony style that sets it apart from other games in this genre. It looks fun to play. It is fun to play. Let's talk about that.  Gameplay Legends of Wrestling employs a pretty simple control scheme, but one that's quite effective. Each of the controller's face buttons is a different kind of move: grapple, strike, attack or block/counter. These can be further modified by pushing in any given direction. Pretty standard, really, but it works well for the style of game that Legends of Wrestling is: an action-based, arcade-style slugfest. There isn't infinite depth to the control scheme, which might disappoint wrestling game purists, but it has definite pick-up-and-playability, which can't be discounted. If you're into lots of different unique moves and styles from the various wrestlers, you may find Legends lacking. Once you've got one wrestler down, you've got a pretty good grasp on how they'll all play. That doesn't necessarily detract from the experience, as they all still have their own stables of tricks, but it's worth mentioning for the technical moves gurus out there.  The thing that makes Legends unique is its combo/countering scheme. It allows you to counter holds and attacks on the fly. As Cypress Hill once said, ~Some defense turns to the offense.~ The interface for using the combo system is slick and easy to use. Basically, when you get into a situation where you can use the combo, a cursor traces along the curved combo meter, and you have to press a button at a specific moment in order to pull it off. In two-player, this makes for a lot of cool reversals and swings in momentum. In single player, mastery of this system will spell victory or doom. Using the combo system, you can turn an ordinary throw into a pin attempt, or apply a head-butt when someone's trying to tie you up. The combo system is Legends of Wrestling's unique stamp, although we're sure to see it employed in other games.  Another cool, nostalgic thing they've included is a reliance on button-mashing. Anyone who's ever played a wrestling game before knows the joy of whaling on a button to get out of a pin. In Legends of Wrestling, you get to button mash when you're trying to pin as well. In two-player, this leads to a mashing extravaganza the likes of which haven't been seen since you and your buddy traded off on the Track and Field machine down at the pub. It's a little thing, but it makes you work for the pin... and if you're anything like me, you'd be mashing anyway.  Match flow is also handled well. A typical bout will go for about five minutes, with several swings in momentum. When starting out, it is very difficult to go out and dominate a match from beginning to end. As you progress through Career Mode and get some experience, it definitely gets easier to win, but you still won't come out and just clean up from the starting bell. There's good balance in the one-player affair, and the two-player game has enough nuances with the counter/combo system to stay fresh for awhile.   Other things add to the fun as well. For instance, when wrestling in a tag match, you can have your opponent jaw at the referee and take his attention away from the match. This is the perfect time to go grab a folding chair and bust some skull. In addition, you can bump or strike the ref to the mat. In Career Mode, this will get you crowd approval and a higher audience rating. You can also Cheat by having your partner come in and double up on someone for a short time, which is a necessary touch in any tag match.  If I had one gripe with the control, it's that it takes a while to perform some of the maneuvers. They're not as lightning quick as in Smackdown! In addition, it's kind of difficult to get the right touch on some of the running moves. Most times when I tried to do a running clothesline or throw, I ended up just bumping into the other wrestler. This part of the game could have been made more dynamic.  Another area that is lacking is the number of available modes. All that's here is the standard Exhibition mode, a modest Career Mode, and a Tournament Mode. By far the best of these is the Career Mode, which allows you to take one of the legends on a tear through America. Your wrestler begins in the South, conquering each region of the country and trying to win approval of the crowd.  This mode is most interesting because of the audience approval needed to succeed. Throughout every match, the crowd's excitement level is closely monitored. If you repeat the same maneuvers and fail to link combos, you won't win their love. Crowd approval feeds into the storyline that takes place in between matches, minimal as it is. Your manager will tell you to get the crowd more involved if you've neglected to create an exciting match, or praise if you've set the house on fire. Sadly, these little impromptu chats between matches are all the Career Mode really offers in the way of story. It's a far cry from some of the stuff done in the Smackdown! series, to be sure.  Also disappointing are the character entrances. This is really the only place where the game's presentation is lacking. The wrestlers all seem to come into the arena in roughly the same way. There isn't enough of the carnival atmosphere and histrionics you expect from wrestling. Back in the day, wrestling wasn't as extreme and vulgar as it is today, but it was definitely larger than life, and I wish the entrances and general match pageantry showed that a bit more.  Back to Modes. Exhibition is really bare bones. It offers one of four match styles: versus, 3 way dance, 4 way dance, or tag team. True, a lot of the kinds of matches we see today weren't large  in classic matches, but at the very least a cage match would have been nice. At least it allows you to select or play as a special referee. Tournament allows you to compete in one of the following tourneys: versus, tag team or tag belt. Tourney matches play the same as regular matches, but if you make it all the way through, you'll end up unlocking bonus wrestlers.  There's a Create-a-Wrestler function as well. This isn't as deep as some of the CAWs we've seen of late, but it isn't lean, either. There could be more body types and the ability to change facial features, but the CAW gives you tons of customization options for apparel, footwear, and moves. There's a lot of recycled gear from other wrestlers, but enough general options for you to piece together your own gal or dude.  Overall, gameplay is about fun, and Legends of Wrestling delivers on this count. While it might not be as deep in the moves and modes categories, it's got a good, arcadey, old-school feel. And it's a fun multiplayer game as well, a must for any wrestling title.    Graphics As I've already stated, the graphics in Legends are grandiose and cartoony. This is a welcome change from some of the angular models we've seen in the past. The wrestlers look beefy and bold, and their movements are grand and exaggerated. I like the overall style that Acclaim is going for, but it falls down a bit in its implementation. In the ring, the wrestlers come across looking like action figures. Their skin is too shiny and plastic-looking. The hair looks kind of like those molded hairstyles that you place on LEGO peoples' heads.   There also isn't a whole lot of differentiation in body types. With the exception of George the Animal Steele and Jimmy Hart, most of the other wrestlers look like they were cast in the same mold. Luckily, a lot of detail has been put into appropriate costuming (and in George's case, hair placement), so the wrestlers come away with different personae regardless of their body types being so similar.  One thing that surprised me was the good lighting. The wrestlers actually cast shadows on each other and the mat, and the ropes cast shadows on anyone who nears them, too. Good attention to detail here.  As for animation, it could stand to be a bit smoother. When you lock up with another wrestler there is a twitching that occurs before one of you perform a move. As stated above, the animations should have been a little faster, too. As for capturing the individual motions and movements, this is pretty well done. Some of the reversals and counters look especially impressive.  Another issue I have is lack of camera control. In Tag matches, the camera is at a fixed angle in the upper corner of the arena. This makes everything much too far away, and there's no option to change it. It would have been nice if the camera would have been more dynamic in these cases. In single player matches, the camera will occasionally switch to a low angle in the corner, which provides a nice change of pace. There are also matrix-style effects when you're doing an exceptionally devastating move, and a good deal of motion blur as well. These effects are used (and not over-used) to good result. However, sometimes the camera does a poor job keeping up with the action. More than once, I was left looking at an empty mat while the camera struggling to find the wrestlers offscreen.  Ultimately, these slight graphical foibles won't irk you unless you're a total graphics snob. The game has a comic-booky feel, and this style is a welcome change. Let's just hope that Legends of Wrestling 2 roughs up the models a little and works on the camera. Be proud you own an Xbox. Once again, this is the best version of a three-system game.  Sound There isn't much to say about sound except that it gets the job done. The crowd noise is average, the guitar rock score is average (not quite catchy, and not quite annoying) and the match sounds are fine.  The announcer only talks to introduce each wrestler, so you don't have to endure repetitive commentary. You do, however, have to put up with quite a bit of grunting. After awhile, you may just decide to turn down the sound effects meter. You might miss some of the excellent slapping and snapping noises, but you won't miss the grunting. Trust me. As for crowd noise, it ebbs and flows accordingly, but doesn't really assert itself in the end. It's like waxing and waning white noise. No individual voices can be heard.  In the end, I'm of the opinion that sound is the least of a wrestling game's worries. Legends of Wrestling neither impresses nor disappoints. I've got much love for any game with Superfly Snuka in it. Sure, it's got some graphical issues and the gameplay is not as flashy as some of its rivals, but Legends of Wrestling has that elusive ~fun~ element. It's a great multiplayer game, and the Career Mode will keep you busy for the times in between.", "date": "Jun 3, 2002"}
