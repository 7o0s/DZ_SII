{"name": "Pokemon Stadium [Japanese Version]", "name_review": "Pokemon Stadium (Import) Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/08/31/pokemon-stadium-import-2", "text": "Nintendo released the original Pokemon Stadium back in 1998 in Japan. The package contained the game as well as the 64GB Pak (called Transfer Pak in the US).We have reviewed the US version of Pokemon Stadium in full, so be sure to check out the review -- but we also decided to add this short import review to let you know whether the Japanese version is worth importing. In one word: no. The original Stadium is a much more limited game than the US game. Not only does it lack more than half of the Pokemon featured in the US version, it also misses many of its great features.It boils down to this. If you own the Japanese version of Pokemon Blue/Red or Yellow and you're looking to link it up to your N64, get the Japanese Pokemon Stadium 2. Although not quite as good as the US Pokemon Stadium, at least PokeSta 2 lets you use all your Pokemon. Even as an add-on for the Game Boy games, Pokemon Stadium Japan is much too limited.", "date": "Aug 31, 1998"}
