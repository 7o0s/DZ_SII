Unfortunately, it's not a name I can write here because children might be reading.  The flight sim community was introduced to Xicat last year, when they published F/A-18 Precision Strike Fighter, which turned out to be a four-year-old sim, repackaged as if it were a new product.  There was nary a sign that it was recycled goods.  Now they're at it again, digging up a dead project and shoving it onto the shelves as if no one would care whether it's awful.  Which it is.    Jane's Attack Squadron looks bad, plays poorly, and is unstable.  It's unrealistic, erratic, and limited.  At one point in its development, this was clearly an ambitious project with a lot of promise.  But that was three years ago, when it was being created by the folks at Looking Glass Studios who gave us the superlative Flight Unlimited, a series of civilian flight sims that showed up Microsoft's Flight Simulator series.  Unfortunately, Electronic Arts decided to stop publishing sims, Looking Glass Studios closed down, and Attack Squadron was officially orphaned.  Now it's back, after having been supposedly finished up by Mad Dog Software, the company who gave us Star Trek Armada II.  The end result has only vestiges of what this sim could and should have been.  At first glance, Attack Squadron seems like a nice varied box of tricks.  There are Allied and Axis campaigns, single missions, instant action, and multiplayer support, all in a nice series of familiar fighters and big bombers.  The included aircraft are your usual suspects with a few distinct aircraft such as the British Lancaster heavy bomber and Germany's Ju-88 medium bomber.  So far, so good.  But the campaigns are a linear sequence of canned and rigidly scripted missions that jump around among different planes and mission types.  This sort of desultory approach gives it a bit of variety, but doesn't offer any sense of continuity.  There's little sense of purpose or accomplishment beyond filling in another line on the ledger that tracks the missions you've played.  There's a pointless pilot roster for each mission, which leads you to believe that perhaps there was a more robust campaign at some point in Attack Squadron's development.  As it is, each mission might as well be one of the single missions.  In fact, considering there are only five single missions, this might have been a better idea.    The mission structures are simply a matter of jumping from waypoint to waypoint and fighting whatever planes have been scripted to appear there.  Theres no sense of navigating, flying in formation, or moving over Europe.  Instead, it's like a Wing Commander game: jump here, shoot down these four guys, jump here, bomb this target, go home.  Actually, you can just skip the 'go home' part; as soon as you accomplish your objective, simply hit Shift+Q to end the mission successfully.  It doesn't matter if you're being jumped by enemy fighters, you have a fuel leak, or your plane is flames and plummeting to earth.  To its credit, the campaign does offer some interesting bomber missions in which you can fly the plane, jump around to various gunnery stations, and then hop into the bombardiers seat.  There's even a torpedo drop from a German bomber, something you're not likely to see in many sims.  The Germans didn't get to mount a lot of air strikes against naval targets, not to mention torpedo drops.  Jane's Attack Squadron is one of the few sims that will let you visit this obscure corner of World War II.  The instant action is good for pitting different types of airplanes against each other, but otherwise it's not very flexible.  The multiplayer support is one of the most underdone parts of this game.  It offers only deathmatches without AI controlled planes.  There's no way to fly bombing missions and no way to get larger dogfights going, since it crashes regularly and is unreliable in terms of getting more than three or four players together.    As a fighter sim, Attack Squadron has some nice features.  The padlock system, which includes an inset window that shows you the aircraft you're tracking, is intuitive and informative.  There's an option to use a target lead indicator that makes shooting down enemy aircraft much easier.  Some hardcore flight simmers might regard this as a sort of cheat, but it's an appropriate way to simulate the gunnery training that most of us armchair pilots haven't had.  The instrument panels on the aircraft are almost entirely superfluous, which is good since many of them are dark and difficult to read.  The flight model in Attack Squadron is a grab bag of fidelity mixed in with heaps of silliness, apparently engineered to make the game simpler and more action oriented.  Aircraft, particularly the heavier bombers, are absurdly nimble.  It's hard to lose speed and even harder to spin or stall, even on the most realistic settings.  The flight model is forgiving to a fault, as if these planes just don't want to leave the sky.  There are some suspiciously canned physics that defy the way bombs really fall, how planes behave with lost or stopped engines, what a heavy loadout will do to performance, and how control compression makes it hard to pull out of a dive.  Also suspicious is how AI controlled planes don't seem to play by the same rules as the player's plane.      Where Attack Squadron feels most like an arcade game is in the damage model, which has a powerful amount of flexibility that's sadly wasted on what seem to be papier-mch aircraft.  Just as the flight model is overly forgiving, the damage model is overly punishing.  There's clearly a lot of detail in how planes' systems and weapons' ballistics are modeled.  When an aircraft is hit, there's an explicit message about what kind of damage the plane has received.  But this detail is squandered when planes are so doggone easy to shoot down.  Fire a few rounds into a target, even a hardy B-17, and it'll fall apart as if you'd been firing explosive shells.  On those rare occasions when you chew up a plane before it crashes, you'll notice that damage doesn't seem to have any effect on how AI planes perform.  Then there are the times when planes just mysteriously explode of their own accord.  This has to rank as one of the oddest bugs I've ever seen in a flight sim.  Screwy physics, bad flight models, and graphics glitches are a dime a dozen in flight sims, but I've never seen planes just suddenly blow up for no reason.   What did you think of Jane's Attack Squadron?  The graphics and sound are what you'd expect from a game that was killed three years ago and then exhumed and propped up on a shelf.  Some of the models are clunky and primitive looking, but it's a passable presentation if you don't have high standards.  There are some oddities, like the super bright dynamic lighting for muzzle flashes and the sewage colored Spitfires.  Overall, Attack Squadron doesn't look much better than Microprose's European Air War and it's barely up to the level of Jane's World War II Fighters, both from 1998.  And it's certainly not up to par, graphically or otherwise, with UbiSoft's IL-2 Sturmovik from last year. Xicat released a patch for Attack Squadron a few weeks after its release, but it didn't include a readme explaining what the patch actually did.  This is a game with myriad problems and shortcomings and when the patch comes along, there's no indication what, if anything, has been fixed.  There's no indication what plans there are, if any, for future bug fixes or features.  Nada.  Total silence.  Which speaks volumes.  Lump this one in with Screamin Demons over Europe, Luftwaffe Commander, Nations, and other underdone and eventually forgotten World War II sims.", "date": "May 6, 2002"}
