As part of the first troupe of games ushered in from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, Dropship promised to bring tactical military fans and aircraft aficionados the kind of hovercraft experience that Warhawk brought in helicopter form to PlayStation owners back in the mid-1990s.With SCEA filled to the brim with its own selection of games, Bam! Entertainment grabbed the chance to bring it here, along with the popular WipEout Fusion. Dropship is a military flight-combat game featuring a fleet of VTOL (vertical-take-off-and-land) crafts that range from heavy, slow and sluggish to  those that lighter, sleek, and almost nimble. Studio Camden's effort offers a wide ranging selection of missions, including land-based vehicle missions in addition to air-based ones, and an integrated Starship Troopers-style story backdrop to provide context and continuity. The final judgment is surely going to be up to the buyers themselves, but from where I sit Dropship is one of those games that's hard to review and difficult to pin down. Dropship is a meaty combat game that offers a steep learning curve, impressive productions values, and a good overall sense of military combat. Yet, it's frustrating and at times even a little hard on the player, making it a labor of love, rather than a pure joy, to play.GameplaySet in the close future, Dropship United Peace Force drops gamers into the role of a rookie UPF dropship pilot, akin to being part of the United Nations, only cooler. You set out upon five different campaigns, with as many as 20 missions in all, and they take place all across the world, from South America to the Middle East to the Far East among other locations. The game's excellent user interface is constructed like a military camp, with tons of documents to read on potential enemies, a full pilot's log, a healthy, five-part training mission, mission records, and more.   The dropship itself is a wieldy cargo/attack vessel that functions much like a more nimble Space Shuttle, a workman-like craft capable of hovering while also carrying on much like a weighty combat jet. Players set course on missions requiring master knowledge of handing the dropship as a ferrying vessel in combination with attack and defend missions. In the early campaigns players will engage in upgrading from the lofty old-style craft to a sleeker, faster version, and soon after that they'll continue to use newer, various other forms of dropships, each with slightly different flight capabilities, speeds, and purposes. Some are slow, clunky and well armored, while others are fast and lithe, using less armor.The notion of piloting a dropship is very appealing, but make no mistake about it, the controls are a little difficult to master. The multi-function military vehicle can take off vertically like a harrier jet in a snap, while within seconds being able to blast through the skies in pursuit of enemy craft. After playing through the very lengthy and very necessary training levels, players find that every button on the Dual Shock has at least one function, if not two or three. The heavy ships, which are designed to be heavy, unfortunately feel and move with a considerable amount of heft, thereby creating not only a slow learning curve, but a frustrating one. So, while the game's very concept drives you to play it, the ability to control it often works against you. Still, I was compelled to continue since I wanted to beat it, but also because I wanted so badly to master piloting the damn dropship I just had to keep playing.The craft enables players to use air-to-air missiles, air-to-ground missiles and an unlimited amount of machinegun fire, while giving players the ability to upgrade and re-load their craft, using strategically placed drop points. The dropship can attack from a hover or a moving position, and most of the missiles are guided. Players get the chance to take out other jets, ground vehicles, helicopters, humans and buildings. A good function to master is to deploy wingmen during missions. By pressing R1 to sift though to the correct wingman, players can select them, then deploy them to attack the desired target, be it a jet, building, copter or turret. While this is a slow, tedious process, it can help in a jam.   Dropship, however, isn't just about flying a dropship. Adding to the whole military immersion is the ability to drive land vehicles, escort fighters, battle tanks, armored assault vehicles and recon planes. If you think the dropships are difficult or slow to control, you might change your mind after driving one of these armored vehicles. These more-or-less military vans handle poorly, with jerky response times and tons of sliding. They're also a little unpredictable. Once, when I was hit by an enemy craft, my vehicle literally bounced up into the air, smacked up against the compound wall, flipped a few times, and then landed back on the ground, undamaged. I finished my mission, no problem, but I should have exploded into a fiery ball of broken metal and glass. On the whole, these vehicles are fun to drive, and their added change in pace creates a nice layer of variety -- but they are serious clunkers.One major problem that seems to have been created to help dropship landings actually hinders the process. A cut-scene occurs when a player nears a landing circle, but it takes the camera off the landing target, disorienting the player and causing more trouble than it's worth. Landings coud have been made more cinematic and simultaneously helpful by showing the action from a higher angle. Another major problem occurs throughout the game, and that's the difficulty balance. While some missions are relatively harmless, others, randomly placed, are brutally difficult. Some fresh testers might have been able to streamline this process a bit better, creating a smoother transition from mission to mission.What makes one so compelled to continue through a game that's hard to control and that is slow to master (if ever)? First, like I said, the dropships are very appealing crafts, and second, the variety and the abundance of missions is impressive and engaging. The game switches gears often and well. The standard kinds of air combat missions are here, from attack to defend, escort and survey, but what's so well done in Dropship is the seamless transition from the basic objectives to fresh new objectives introduced mid-mission. Making the cut-scenes and missions flow so well together is the radio communication between HQ and yourself, as well as chatter between other UPF pilots and yourself.   A good example of growing intensity in a level is found in the second mission, wherein you and your cargo ships are meant to drop off goods, and reload them in three different locations. But during your flight, endless waves of enemy crafts attack the cargo ships you're supposed to defend. They're wily and quick and they outnumber you. And just when you think you've finished off one, another wave zooms in, picking off your valuable teammates. Finally, after four waves have attacked and been felled by your superior skills, an even larger swarm of ships fly in with bombers, blasting the crap out of your base. Every skill you've learned from the training is tested here, from landing quickly, to handling the craft, to air-to-air combat and prioritizing enemies.Other missions are more drastic in their variation. In an early mission, using a hefty old dropship, players must save an abandoned cargo vehicle smack dab in enemy territory. You land to save it but your ship is so old and damaged it starts smoking and quickly, using a steady cutscene, players find that their mission has transformed into a land-vehicle mission. The dropship explodes and you're left only to save yourself. Enemy vehicles are swarming in from all sides, and you must use the tracking system from HQ to escape. The second part of the mission is driving, but it's followed by a cooler third part, in which your partner drives while you use the turreted machine gun to blast away everything from men to vehicles to bases to helicopters, like a rail shooter. It's very good fun.   GraphicsAn ambitious first-generation PlayStation 2 game, Dropship looks average by today's standards, but it might have looked better if it had shipped last fall, for instance. Again, we?re happy it's come to the US, but why so late? Ah well?Anyway, Dropship boasts the ability to show off vast landscapes with little to no fogging, a steady framerate (60 fps), and a few special effects to boot. While the game does indeed boast huge views, it's a standard thing on these systems, while the cooler, more impressive goal is to produce great looking textures while also providing the large vistas. Unfortunately, Dropship's textures are medium to low resolution, and they're also plain and drab. The military color scheme of brown, green and black create a redundant, unimpressive textual appeal. One can actually see the LOD working, as the dropship zooms over a hill that clicks into focus like it got switched on. Sure, I'd pick framerate over textures, if I had a choice, but why not have both?Other aspects of Dropship are mildly impressive. The ship designs are certainly pretty to look at, and luckily, deeper in the levels, newer, more sleek ships are available to pilot. And the articulation of the dropships is cool, too. You see all of the parts moving, including the jet engine itself (on one of the smaller models). A nice set of heat effects are used to blur the air behind the jet engines, while good use of smoke and particles show off other good effect systems.All in all, Dropship does a respectable job of producing good enough textures to get by, while the other aspects -- framerate, ship design, and vast environments, good CG, and an excellent UI -- do the rest. SoundDropship offers a military set of sounds that work perfectly with the themes of the game, but there is nothing musically that stands out so drastically to set you humming for the rest of the day. The sound effects, however, are where the game chimes, so to speak. With excellent and consistent voice commands coming from headquarters, wingmen, and other supporting ship pilots, the game is also bolstered by excellent engine sounds (especially those used when the dropship takes off from the ground), and a toolkit of other special effects. Gamers also have the chance to select mono, stereo, or surround sound in Dropship, which adds to its aural appeal.Dropship is one of those games that will appeal to a very specified, small group of gamers. It's niche stuff. Like a flight sim, the dropships are larger and weightier than jets, taking a long, slow time to master. Unlike the fast, wham-bam arcade-style of Ace Combat 4, Dropship makes up for it with variety and excellent production. It contains massive combat sequences and superb and seamless cutscenes, enabling smooth transitions from early objectives to secondary and third mission objectives. In essence, as military combat games go, Dropship is the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none kind. I would forewarn gamers that Dropship takes a good amount of time to master. It also brings on the enemy AI hard at times, making the game challenging and sometimes frustrating. It's not a casual, ho-hum game, by any means. Still, I definitely would recommend it to hardcore gamers, because it's an atypical title that's really unlike anything else on the PS2 market. Definitely rent this, and perhaps even buy it.", "date": "Jun 13, 2002"}
