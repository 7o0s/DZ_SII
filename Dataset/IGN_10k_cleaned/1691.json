The venerable franchise has been kickin' like fried chicken since 1996 and, like Energizer, it just keeps going and going and going.  It's been a year since the release of the mighty Quake III: Arena, and hordes of Quake-heads are still fragging it out incessantly online. But, for the most part, the focus of Q3: A was you against the world.  There were a few team play modes, but nothing overly exciting and, while Clans have been hosting their own pseudo team matches for years, id has stepped in and offered up Team Arena, where the focus is on Blue or Red rather than just ~you.~  The first thing you'll notice when you load the game is the new user interface.  Id has achieved their goal of creating an enhanced UI that is simple to use, yet gives the player access to tons of options at the click of a few mouse buttons.  The new interface is a lot more functional than the old UI and, although you still have to use the console for some advanced functions, most users won't even have to mess with typing at all, instead finding everything they need in the pull-down menus.  There's also the addition of all-new video sequences for each level embedded in the interface, so you can catch a glimpse of the hot spots before you even begin to play.  These new videos also relieve some of the ~what in the hell map was this again~ experiences we had with Q3: Arena.  Like I mentioned earlier, the biggest new addition in Team Arena is, aptly enough from the name, team play.  In getting away from its pure deathmatch roots, the folks at id have added:   Classic CTF: Easy enough -- capture a flag located in the opposing team's base and return it to yours.  One Flag CTF: Like above, but with only one flag located in a central room. However, you don't return it to your base, but rather to the enemy base.    Harvester: Every time a player is fragged, a skull appears near a skull generator in the center of the map. Like One Flag CTF, you have to grab as many of the other team's skulls as possible and take them back to the enemy's base. If you get killed while carrying skulls, you lose them all.   Overload: Each team's base contains a skull-adorned obelisk. The point of the game is to destroy the other team's obelisk, which can be pretty damn tough.   Overall these new game play types enhance Quake III by leaps and bounds.  We love team play around here, so we found Team Arena to be especially fun, especially One Flag CTF and Harvester.  There's nothing quite as satisfying as humiliating your opponent by fragging him or her and then carrying the hard-earned skull into their base and scoring.  Unfortunately, these game types aren't going to be everyone's cup of giblets, so to speak.  The problem with team play is that your success is dependant on those you play with, so if you get stuck with a team that doesn't work together, chances are it's going to ruin the fun.  But that's easy enough to solve...just jump onto another server.  It should also be noted that, like Q3: Arena, there's not much of a single-player component here, and it's really only a warm up for the multiplayer game.  So if you're into team-based online play, you're probably going to like Team Arena, but if you like single-player shooters or deathmatch, you might want to think twice about getting the expansion.  Internet performance was pretty solid, and it's a breeze to find or set up a server in Team Arena.  Like any other online game, lag is inevitable, but the Quake III network code has always been tight, and we only ran into major lag issues on a few select servers that were either overloaded with too many players or were running both bots and humans.  We did run into some CD key authorization and skin mismatch problems on more than one machine, but re-entering the original Quake III: Arena CD key solved the CD key verification, and reinstalling the game worked for the skin mismatch dilemma.  Because of the addition of the new team-based game types, new maps were a must.  Team Arena features eight new team maps, four new tournament maps, four redesigned maps from Q3: Arena, and three outdoor maps (ranging in size from ~perfect for 6-on-6~ to ~where in the $#*& is everybody~ expansive).  Even in a 12-on-12 game, the biggest of the outdoor maps was too large to really have much fun on, and more players than 24 overloaded most servers, even on a LAN.  To keep balance between the teams, most of the maps in TA are mirror images of each other with a central area that houses the skull generator or the flag in One Flag CTF.  For the most past, the new smaller maps are well designed and include lots of jump spots and portals to keep the action moving and airborne.    We've talked about all of the new power-ups in our preview, so I won't go into them again, but I will say that the team did a good job with coming up with ideas for the new power-ups.  Each of them comes in handy in certain situations and offers up all new gameplay strategies for the creative player.  Only one player can have the individual power-ups from a spawn point on a map at any given time, so it's good strategy to plan who should nab what.  For example, Scout makes a flag-runner that much more effective, Guard is perfect for the defensive or offensive powerhouse of the team, and the Ammo Regen makes the mine-layers very, very, very happy.  It's new strategies like this that are going to make Clan-based play that much more meaningful.  New weapons in Team Arena include the prox mine launcher and the return of the nailgun and chaingun to the Quake universe.  While I always like to see more weapon variations in a shooter, the new weapons in Team Arena add little to the way the game plays and, with the exception of the mine layer, I prefer to stick with the tried-and-true rocket launcher.  For example, the chaingun, which was a powerhouse in Quake II, runs out of ammo way too fast to be very effective against the likes of the rocket launcher or an effective railgunner, and the redefined nailgun isn't as effective as its original counterpart since it shoots a barrage of nails over a wide radius all at once, similar to the shotgun, only slower.  It's powerful at close range, but it's so slow that it becomes almost useless on all but the lowest lag servers.  We also found that some weapon/power-up combinations, like the aforementioned prox mine with the Ammo Regen, really throw off the balance of the game, as you can incessantly mine the entirety of the smaller maps, making navigation for the enemy team all but impossible.  Get one good miner on your team and you don't need much else in the way of defense.  Of course, Quake III has never really been about balance anyway, with constant fast-paced action winning out over game equilibrium, and seeing a constant chain of ~You Fragged [insert poor sap's name here]~ when you're no where near them is certainly satisfying.  Visually, Team Arena looks amazing, but not as nice as some of the other visual treats that have crossed our desks this holiday season such as Alice, Giants, and Sacrifice.  It's still amazingly pretty with dazzling lighting effects, tight bump-mapped textures, and elegant curved surfaces, but graphics technology is moving at such a rapid pace that it's not the mind-blowing experience it was last year.  Unfortunately for id, Team Arena may be a little too visually ambitious.  One of the big drawbacks of graphical acuity is system performance, and Team Arena is even more of a system hog than Q3: Arena.  From a recent poll on our site, most of you are running on 400-600Mhz machines, and I'm afraid you're going to be incredibly disappointed with Team Arena's performance at full detail if you try to run it on anything less than a 600.  Even on an 800Mhz machine with a GeForce 2, I encountered nasty slowdown running in resolutions higher than 1024x768 in full detail.  While the graphics in Team Arena are a step up, the new models in Team Arena are just crap.  There are only two new character models, with a handful of skins, and they just don't live up to the quality and variety of Quake III: Arena's models.  Add this with the fact that the Internet is flooded with better looking and more creative user-created models and the new characters in Team Arena just look plain sad.  The Team Arena pack does add two new models for the original Quake III, Pi and Fritzfrieg, who both look pretty stylish, but this just makes us wonder even more why the Team Arena models look so generic and bland.  Another low point for Team Arena is the audio.  The effects sound good enough, and are well recorded albeit sparse, but the voice work sounds distorted and lo-fi.  While the team may have been going for a snowy, crackling effect, what's the use of hiring professional voice actors unless you can clearly understand what they're saying?  It doesn't help that the voice taunts are immature drivel like ~My momma shoots better than you~ and ~You wanna buy a shot?~ either.  Team Arena does include a new Doppler effect on the larger projectiles like rockets which is kind of cool, but overall the sound work was only a little bit better than average.  We also had misgivings about the Artificial Intelligence.  While id claims the AI has been improved, I found it worse than in the original Arena.  I was pretty impressed with the AI in Q3: A, but bots don't coordinate attacks or perform the complex tasks required for effective squad-based play very well in Team Arena, even when you give them direct orders.  Of course, there's nothing like playing against real human opponents, anyway.  So how does Team Arena fare in the end?  Well, it passes the most important test -- it's one hell of a lot of fun!  While it's not without its share of problems, Team Arena is certainly a worthy addition to any Quake III fan's library.  It's a good expansion pack.  Not great, but good.  It expands the gameplay of Quake III to new heights and, although you can find similar mods out there for the cost of a download, true Quake fans are going to want anything and everything Quake they can get their hands on.  All in all it's a good package, but whether you need it or not all depends on your play preference.  If you're into team play games, then you'll get a big kick out of Team Arena, but if not, it's probably not worth the money when you can just download a buttload of mods and maps for free.  -- Tal Blevins      Want to share your opinions with the world?
