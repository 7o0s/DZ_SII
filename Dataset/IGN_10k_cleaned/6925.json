{"name": "JAWS Unleashed", "name_review": "JAWS Unleashed", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/26/jaws-unleashed", "text": "There are two ways you can look at Majesco's oft-delayed underwater actioner, JAWS Unleashed... You can either (A) Swim away in disappointment from a project that had more than two years of production time (with an experienced developer) and yet still finds itself full of problems and bugs, or (B) stop being such a pretentious conch and enjoy the open-ended ~Grand Shark Auto~ for what it is -- mindless fun.   Of course, if we're being fair, it's actually hard to accept one of those final conclusions without accepting the other. Truth be told, Appaloosa's JAWS Unleashed embraces both of those justifications rather symbiotically (much like barberfish and hammerheads do in real life). Though it's correct that JAWS does suffer from a number of bothersome glitches, numerous camera issues, and sometimes-infuriating lock-ups, it also benefits from a number of gruesomely satisfying missions, a large environment to play around with, and unique combat maneuvers that you just can't do in any other game. Of those, which sounds more tolerable?   The magic eight ball says,  But let's start with the basics: what is JAWS Unleashed anyway? In the simplest of terms it's yet another entry in the increasingly popular line of genre-blending ~sandbox~ games. In other words, the development team has given you an entire world to explore and now it's your job to go out and play in it. And play in it you can! There are three major coasts around Amity Island with multiple environment types in each area (swampland canals, ship graveyards, traditional beaches, etc), and a number of destructible objects can be found in all of them (harbors, boats, jet skis, animals, you name it). Moreover, players can also opt to take part in story-based missions or unrelated sidequests whenever they want and continue to go on with things even after they've finished they game.   But what's that I said? ~Story-based missions?~ Believe it or not, JAWS Unleashed does try to tell one... painfully generic and short as it may be (the abbreviated plot: everyone wants to kill the shark... surprise!). Uninspired yarn aside, the narrative does provide the means for our friend Bruce (that's the shark) to get into some pretty interesting situations. A rampage through a Sea World-like theme park, the destruction of a pollution-causing chemical plant, and cool boss battles against things we only wish we'd see on Animal Planet (Great White vs. Orca baby!) are just a few of the circumstances you'll find yourself in.   Internet community, this is Bruce... and he has an eating disorder. In addition to the main story mode that can be started or stopped at any time after the second level, there are also 32 sidequests with three difficulty levels apiece. While not as long as the main stages, these side-missions are arguably the more entertaining ways to pass the time. Hidden collectibles, timed races, and a number of neat challenges involving eating, destroying, or a combination thereof are surprisingly addictive. Stealth killing a hapless swimmer, only to launch them into the air like a lawn dart towards a beach-based sun tent is a lot more fun than it sounds (and it already does sound like a lot of fun doesn't it?).   Keeping things interesting, JAWS also has a number of cool moves at his disposal. Besides his obvious ~weapon mouth,~ Bruce also employs a number of secondary attacks like the tail whip, the nose ram, a covert victim grab, and supplementary ~advanced ~moves that are unlocked via experience points (dive bomb splashes, corkscrew attacks, and jumping 'one-bite kills' are just a few of them). Put it all together and you have the true heart of what JAWS is: having a blast via destruction and uncontrolled consumption.    Now my shark-like instincts are telling me that with all that I've said thus far, some of you might be wondering where that ~symbiotic disappointment~ I mentioned earlier comes in. For that answer, I also ask that you remember the bit I had about the bugs, the camera issues, and the lock-ups. It's those frequent aspects that grab what could have been a very impressive underwater actioner and harpoon it downward a couple of notches. Fun and mindless as JAWS may be, it could have been a lot better thanks to a couple of rather devastating hitches.   It's hard to say which problem is the most bothersome of all JAWS Unleashed's issues, but if we had to pick one it would be the camera -- it is one stubborn and schizophrenic little bastard. Though users have the option to choose three different perspectives (free, locked, and first-person), it frequently gets caught in weird positions making it hard to see what's going on in tight spaces or populated areas. This dilemma is made even worse in that during most missions, JAWS will find himself in tight spaces or populated areas, and the camera becomes even more problematic if you travel from the surface to underwater on a regular basis (which you will, because you're a shark!). The sad thing is, that while you can certainly learn to live with this problem after an hour or so, it never goes away -- so it always feels like you're fighting the analog sticks when in combat.   This boat doesn't see JAWS yet, but then again, with all the game's camera problems, the shark probably won't see the boat for much longer either. Unleashed's bugs and glitches are almost as bad. Swim too close to some kind of structure (especially in narrow quarters), for example, and it's entirely possible (re: likely) that Bruce will get stuck on invisible polygons never to detach again -- forcing you to load from an earlier save point and thereby repeating everything you just did; this sequence is especially a pain if you had just uncovered a lot of hidden stuff prior to the need for a restart. But that's not the only glitch, not by a long shot. Required victims for missions will sometimes never be accessible at all (forcing another reload), while certain enemies will mysteriously double and triple in damage power for no apparent reason. It's also not unheard of to see the game lock-up altogether and require a hard boot... and this is with the retail copy folks (the Xbox version seemed to give us the most trouble of them all). That's pretty annoying!   As you might imagine, these problems definitely take their toll and when combined with a few questionable design choices make it harder to enjoy (the overworld map, for instance, doesn't show you which missions you've completed and which ones you haven't). The visuals aren't very impressive either. Strange textures and character models occasionally make people look inhuman and unexplained showdown, pop-in, and tearing will occur with frequency. The island of Amity is populated with all sorts of different life and objects, however, and the animations for most everything are pretty good too. Credit goes to the team for that.JAWS Unleashed is one of those difficult kinds of games to pigeonhole because it has such strong plusses and minuses. What it really boils down to is ~What kind of experience are you're looking for?~ Are you a ~My ocean is half-full~ kind of a guy or a ~my ocean is half-empty~ sort of person? From our perspective, we tend to lean in the more positive direction because the destruction and people-eating is just so dang fun despite all the technical problems. Sadly, with a little more fine-tuning and care it could have been a one heck of a cool game.", "date": "May 26, 2006"}
