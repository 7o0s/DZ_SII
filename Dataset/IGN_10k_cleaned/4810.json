{"name": "TOCA Championship Racing", "name_review": "TOCA Touring Car", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/10/01/toca-touring-car", "text": "The British Touring Car Championship is one of the world's most exciting race series. On the face of it, it might not seem so: the only cars valid for entry are mass-production four-door sedan cars with engines no greater than 2.0 liters. However, while that may sound like an average family mobile, TOCA cars are stripped out to drastically reduce weight, feature tuned engines capable of producing up to 300 horsepower, have fully modified suspension and thunder around on soft-compound racing tires. Not only that, but strict weight and power regulations ensure that no car gains an unfair advantage, and the end result is very, very close racing.  Eight different car manufacturers participate in the series: Renault (Laguna), Audi (A4), Volvo (S40), Honda (Accord), Peugeot (406), Nissan (Primera  better known as the Maxima in the states), Ford (Modeo  called the Contour over here) and Vauxhall (Vectra). The Championship is run over 24 rounds which take place on nine different British tracks, which include world famous Silverstone and Brands Hatch. And there's not an oval in sight. Codemasters' TOCA Championship Racing is a very faithful recreation of BTCC racing. Graphically, the game looks great. The cars are beautifully rendered and the track graphics are very good, recreating the real courses in a convincing fashion. Sound is also very lifelike, and thanks to the realistic car samples, the game sounds just like the real McCoy. This realism continues in the gameplay. This is no arcade game: it's a simulation, and because it's very faithful to real life, it's very challenging. Novice drivers taking an arcade approach to the game will quickly find themselves out of control and spinning off the track. To actually drive a TOCA car successfully, one must consider variables such as the car's weight shift, track camber, bumps in the road and curbs, and execute straight-line braking, correct turn-in and non-contact overtaking.  The superb AI also contributes to the racing realism. Other cars behave very realistically, and some AI drivers are very aggressive  they block the racing line, and if you start bumping and jostling, they bump back. The end result of all this is a race game that requires a good degree of skill and concentration: novices need not apply. But if you're up for it, TOCA provides highly enjoyable and very thrilling racing.  The game sports the usual roster of options. Players can opt for a single race, or enter a full-blown championship with variable weather conditions  which offers a huge long-term challenge that takes plenty of practice to master. There's also a time trial mode, and the game has the facility for up to four players to participate at once using a split screen. Internet players have the ability to race other drivers over the 'net, lan or by linking to another player with a modem.  There are only two real disappointments about TOCA. First and foremost is the lack of car setup facility. This is a dreadful oversight, especially considering that this is such a realistic game: I'd have loved to be able to tweak my car's setup to fine-tune it for each track. Hopefully this feature will be incorporated into next year's edition. I was also unimpressed by the presentation screens. They're very poor. The car select screen is blurry and the cars are really badly drawn. How about full color pics of all the cars, using the actual game models so you can really look at them? It'd have been great if Codemasters had featured videos of the cars actually racing, a bio of each driver and some history about each car. I think this would have been especially useful for the US market, where little is known about the racing series, the drivers and car manufacturers like Peugeot, Renault and Vauxhall.  But even with those two negatives, TOCA is still a thoroughly enjoyable title that offers everything a racing game should: challenge, excitement and entertainment. Highly recommended to hardcore racing fans who want to try something a little different.  Jaz Rignall", "date": "Oct 1, 1998"}
