Blazkowicz, a US Army Ranger out to stop Hitler from creating an army of demonic soldiers in an attempt to annihilate the Allies. The plot is campy, hokey, and it makes complete sense in a game like RTCW; who doesn't want to mindlessly shoot Nazis and demons with an arsenal of weapons that includes everything from machine guns to flame throwers?  Though RTCW: Operation Resurrection is a port of the PC game, there is a distinction that needs to be made between the two, as well as from the Xbox version, confusingly titled, Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War. While the complete PC game is found in Operation Resurrection, there are additional levels tacked on to the start of the game that further flesh out the Agent One character, as well as detailing how B.J. actually gets captured and thrown into the dungeon of Castle Wolfenstein. While nothing too drastic or spectacular, the added levels make sense in context of the game, and also help the story ease its way into the main plotline.   Outside of the introductory levels, the only other significant difference between all three versions is that Operation Resurrection (that's the PS2 version, in case you're already lost) lacks any and all multiplayer modes found in the PC and Xbox versions. Now, any Wolfenstein fan will know that the multiplayer was one of the big draws of the PC game, and is also the standout feature of Tides of War. Can the PS2 Operation Resurrection stand on its own two feet as a single player game with no multiplayer to lean on? Read on.  Gameplay You love shooting things, don't you? Of course you do. Shooting every moving object on your television screen is a great American pastime, don't you know? If you're one of those folk who could use a little less of the shooting and a little more of the thinking, then this is not the game for you. Return to Castle Wolfenstein is as straightforward a shooter as they come. Though the objectives list will often assign you interesting sounding goals such as  ~Disrupt local delivery of supplies,~ or ~Obtain information on Deathshead's destination,~ what it translates to is, ~Shoot everything and everyone in every room, and while you're at it, press the action button at every glowing object you come up to.~     But don't take this the wrong way. We love shooting stuff. A lot. And in that respect, Return to Castle Wolfenstein offers up a hefty plate bullets and shells. The action is tense and brutal, especially on the harder difficulties, and the weapon selection should leave even the most gun-thirsty gratified. But often times a shooter is only as good as its enemies are smart, and in this respect, RTCW falls flat. Yes, the battles can be thrilling, and at times difficult, but sheer numbers and strength are to blame, not fiendishly clever AI. This is one game where standing by a doorway and waiting for each and every enemy to walk out works every time. Still, as clueless and robotic as the enemies are, there's something strangely delicious about pumping lead into an army of assembly line opponents. Play Serious Sam if you're still clueless.   For a game that puts so much emphasis on action, it's amusing to see stealth elements being advertised as one of the game's features. Granted, situations do arise where you can sneak up on someone and stab them with your lighting dagger hand, but it's almost as if these rare events are planted and planned, and not based on your stealth abilities. When enemies are aware of your presence even before you're in their line of sight, it seems inconsistent that other soldiers will let you walk right up to them in an oh-so-convenient situation. Stealth that is predetermined loses a lot of its appeal and satisfaction. Better to set opponents on fire with the trusty flamethrower.       As mentioned earlier, RTCW: Operation Resurrection lacks a multiplayer mode. This, my friends, is saddening news no matter which way you look at it. Now, the lack of an online multiplayer mode is horrid enough, but to not implement even a split-screen deathmatch or co-op mode. For shame. And for this great loss, what do PS2 owners get? The ability to use earned points to increase stats or buy items. Wooptydoo (well, it's actually more than a novelty, as it does help out later in the game, but still).  Graphics Return to Castle Wolfenstein was quite the looker when it was released on the PC, and Raster Productions has done an exceptional job bringing its likeness to the PS2. In fact, Operation Resurrection looks almost identical to the PC version, albeit in lower resolution, and with the presence of the infamous PS2 jaggies -- by no means a small feat. The texture quality is impressive, as is the steady framerate. Only in isolated situations, like manning a gun turret, does the framerate chop up. Even then, it's trivial at worst.  With the great technical achievement of bringing the game to the PS2 in a faithful manner (see flamethrower below), why then is the collision detection often dodgy? Unless Nazis and inanimate guns can float in some alternate universe, there are some definite graphical issues to deal with in Operation Resurrection. Especially frequent when shooting enemies on ledges, the supernatural nature of some of the objects/characters in the game is not really detrimental to the game per say, but if there's anything that will shatter the suspension of disbelief, a dead soldier hovering twenty feet in the air will do it. Is it finally time to move past the aging Quake III engine? Perhaps.  RTCW: Operation Resurrection is a great-looking game that does its PC and Xbox counterparts proud. The game even outshines many other PS2 FPSs. While not without its faults, overall, the game is a visual success. Now about that kicking animation   Sound There's a lot to like, and little to dislike, with regards to the sound in RTCW: Operation Resurrection. Like Medal of Honor, particular events/points in the game will trigger a surge of music that heightens the tension of the situation. The quality is great, and fits the game well with its almost patriotic theme. Ambient music is also of note, with subtle snare rolls and orchestration. Then there are the rooms where classical songs are playing out of vitrolas, namely Fur Elise. Ah, the sweet, sweet sounds of Beethoven in Nazi Germany.   The rest of the aural package is of equal quality. The guns boom with thunder, the undead moan with grief, and the Nazis speak with, er, righteousness? Yes, even the voice acting is of decent quality. Somewhat ironic, don't you think, considering the game's lack of any real drama when compared to the likes of an RPG or adventure game that features hokey voice acting? More power to Wolfenstein, I guess. Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Operation Resurrection loses big on the PS2 because of its lack of multiplayer modes. As is, the single player game is fun the first time through, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a motivating reason to go back through it. Still, if you're looking for some no-frills first-person action, RTCW: Operation Resurrection will do the job and do it well. But rent first, as, depending on what you're looking for, the game's limiting lasting power may or may not be worth the fifty bones for admission.", "date": "May 28, 2003"}
