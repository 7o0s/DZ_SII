The game was everywhere -- at the tops of bestseller lists, preloaded on new handsets, front and center at the launch of Verizon's V CAST service... However, after Electronic Arts bought JAMDAT to gain dominance in the space, one of the greatest organically produced mobile hits went dark. Even Trip Hawkins, CEO and founder of Digital Chocolate, wondered aloud during his Game Developers Conference keynote where the game had gone.   It's been branded with the Sims, apparently. The Sims Bowling has almost every bit of the old JAMDAT Bowling DNA, but tacks on some Sims trimming such as the ability to create an avatar and pursue popularity by winning matches again and again. The game play is largely the same, as players manipulate a series of meters -- power, direction, spin -- to cast the ball down the lane. This system is entirely functional, but in late 2007, it must be noted that it does not advance the ball in the least.   Sure, a winning formula doesn't necessarily need to be reinvented just for sake of it, but after some time with the game, I felt like I was stuck in 2004. There has to be something new to add to the JAMDAT formula other the Sims branding. And that branding is oddly implemented, too. At the start of the game, you create your Sim -- which is cool -- and then you're told that your Sim as the desire to be popular. You can increase the Sim's popularity aspiration through playing. Again, that's fine, but after some time you realize that there are no other character tracks. Why bother setting this feature up if it's not going to be followed through on?   I tested Sims Bowling on a Sony Ericsson w810i. The game loads quite a bit. A little clock between frames wears out its welcome quickly. Why so much loading, even if for only three seconds a pop? The actual game play moves at a pretty good clip, but when the ball roars through the pins, those things carom wildly. Pins fly through other pins that remain standing. I understand that the game has already run the calculation that determines what pins are dropping, but don't give me false hope like that.   So, why the 7? Because the game is still a solid bowler. The meter system is a little creaky, but it works. And the addition of game modes like Strike-a-thon and Spare-a-thon (you need to get as many of those in a row as possible) are nice extras.   Note: There are editions of Sims Bowling that offer online multiplayer, such as LG VX8100 on Verizon and Samsung M610 on Sprint. This mode lets you bowl with another player over the network instead of just playing against computer-controlled Sims.  The Sims Bowling is the direct descendant of JAMDAT Bowling, but not enough genetic intermingling keeps it from being too close of a facsimile. Only updated visuals and a few new game modes, like Spare-a-Thon, keep this game strictly out of 2004 territory. So while the game itself is absolutely solid, it is indeed dated and hard to recommend to anybody looking for a mobile bowler that offers anything significantly new. That said, if it's just a basic bowler that you desire, then this wholly functional game will get you through.", "date": "Oct 2, 2007"}
