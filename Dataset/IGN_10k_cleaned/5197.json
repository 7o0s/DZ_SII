{"name": "Bejeweled", "name_review": "Bejeweled", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/02/bejeweled", "text": "An online sensation, Bejeweled follows in the same vein as other classic puzzle titles. Another of those tile puzzle games, Bejeweled shares only slight similarities to granddaddy Tetris. Once again you must remove connected colored tiles. The difference is, these tiles aren't dropping from above. Instead, you begin with a full board. You can grab any tile and swap it with an adjoining tile either left, right, up, or down. But you can only do this if it creates a link of at least three vertical or horizontal like tiles (which destroys them). Gravity does exist, so tiles will fall if there is a game and more tiles fall into once again completely fill the board. It's simple and just different enough from other tile games that it seems new.   There are two modes to try, either Normal of Time Trial. It would have been nice to have a puzzle mode of some kind and the lack of a two-player option (an essential part of most puzzle games) hurts considerably. Live scoreboards are in effect here and your game automatically saves if you quit early. This means you can play for a bit, leave and come back the next day to continue. While the game itself is fun, the lack of multiplayer (even on the same 'box) is a real letdown, especially since there is a multiplayer version of Bejeweled available on other mediums.", "date": "Nov 2, 2004"}
