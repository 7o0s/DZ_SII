Pool Hustler is a one to two-player game that enables gamers to bet on games and make money from the win. The object in the Story Mode is to travel from pool hall to pool hall improving your game, betting and taking the cash to bigger and bigger gambles. Of course, the competition gets better too, and the stakes become higher and higher.   Rather than tacky FMV cut-scenes the game uses well, rather plain still shots with voice bubbles from the opponent's mouths. Occasionally opponents may bet on your shots, and vice versa, and you can either win or lose even more money.   Pool Hustler makes available about five modes, three of which are the heart of the game, Story mode, Two-player (you versus a real person), and trick shot (in which you can see tricks being performed and then you can practice until your palms are sweaty).  Several little helpful additions are packed into Pool Hustler. You can view the trajectory of the white ball before you shoot, and you can check the angle you're at. By depressing the square button you can adjust top or bottom spin, as well as right or left English. Of course, the power of the shot is adjustable with X. Using the L and R buttons adjusts any camera angle backward or forward from any angle you choose, as well as allowing zooming in or out of the screen, a very nice function.  Pool Hustler is supported by analog control and is in retail stores as of today, September  30, 1998.Pool Hustler is the kind of game that neither stokes a fire in your belly nor angers you to the point of a heart attack. I like the ~Hustler~ aspect of the game, which makes the single-player game much more interesting and provides it gamers with more compunction to finish the game.Like light-gun games, you really can't just eye the game and get the angles right immediately. With those, you must synchronize your gun. With Pool Hustler, you must adjust to the game's angles, or rather, it's aiming system. It's not bad, but it's not terrible natural either.What I thought needed some serious work was the blaringly miserable music. It's worse than elevator music, but just slightly better than porn music...or vice versa. Man, with CD capabilities, ASK could have really composed just about anything, but it appears the developer simply threw in some really unlistenable tunes, if you can call them that.I also noticed a couple of things I didn't like: you can shoot right through a ball that sits in front of your white ball, and your opponent plays almost as slow as you do. Why not speed up your opponents' play, which will give you back the ball faster, so that you can play more. I mean it's not like you're actually in a bar smoking and enjoying a beer, taking it all in. You're in your living room or the den and you're all by yourself. This isn't a game I would buy, especially if I could rent it first.", "date": "Oct 1, 1998"}
