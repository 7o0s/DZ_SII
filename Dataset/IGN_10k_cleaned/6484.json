Tower Bloxx is just such a game, a puzzler with simple action for casual fans, but real depth for dedicated players that want to dig into it. The initial concept is deliriously simple -- stacking blocks to create, well, towers -- but if you stick around long enough to explore the imbedded city building element, I promise you that you will find twenty minute blocks of time disappear like free food at a video game press event.   The basic play element has you dropping the building blocks of towers into place. A massive crane swings each floor of the tower overhead. You press the action button to release the block and try to make the tower as straight as possible. You do have some wiggle room. Towers will stay standing if you fudge it a little bit, but the more blocks you pile not directly on top of each other, the more the tower will sway. This, naturally, makes it harder to create a straight tower. If you manage to drop a block so it snaps into place firmly above another, you activate a bonus meter. Any block dropped in place during the bones time gives you extra points -- which, in the case of Tower Bloxx, are counted as building inhabitants.   You have three tries per building to get the construction right. If you drop a block so it misses the tower completely, or place one too far on the edge of the previous in-place block, you can lose a bit of the tower and its inhabitants. If you blow through all three tries, you do not get to put the capstone on the building, and it will never reach full occupancy.   Now, this feeds into the second aspect of the game: town building. You aren't creating these towers just for giggles -- you are a city planner in charge of twenty-five square blocks of downtown space. Every building you construct is installed in the downtown area. The more buildings you erect, the more citizens live in your town.   There are four different kinds of buildings, each one taller than the other. The first building is a basic blue apartment complex. As you build more buildings, you get a red commerce tower, a green high-rise, and finally, a yellow skyscraper. And you cannot just build these structures anywhere. Blue apartments can be dropped on any block, but red commerce towers must be built next to blue apartments. Green high-rises must neighbor a red and blue building. And yellow towers must neighbor blue, red, and green buildings. In order to maximize your population, you need to carefully plan where you want these buildings to go just as much as you need to concentrate on dropping the blocks in the ~action~ part of the game.   The two play elements work beautifully together, feeding into each other to create an incredibly ~full~ play experience. It always remains somewhat casual, but like I said, if you want to really sink your teeth into Tower Bloxx, the game gives you more than enough to chew on.   DChoc's Tower Bloxx ships in two flavors: 2D and 3D. I played the game on a Nokia 6620, which offered only the 2D edition. The game play between the two versions is identical, just the graphics are a little different. As you build towers, inhabitants fly in via umbrellas to assume their living quarters. The game is clean, colorful, and attractive. And it plays a nice, harmless little jingle while you go about your bidness as a city planner and crane operator.  Tower Bloxx is just one of those game that absolutely grabbed me. At first, I wasn't sure what to make of the simple tower building parts, but when you start to explore the city planning element, the need to build better towers really presents itself. The sooner you hit population milestones, the sooner you can build the bigger towers and really goose the number of people living in your new city. The game smartly limits the building types to four, so it never feels overwhelming, too. I have been playing this one quite a bit lately, and after finishing up this rev, I'll continue to goof with it. That's how I know I've stumbled upon a winner -- I want to play it long after I've closed up shop for the day.", "date": "Dec 7, 2005"}
