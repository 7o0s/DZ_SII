And that means the mobile games based on those tentpole flicks are about to hammer handsets will full-force. The season's first movie tie-in to trickle on to the decks in Blaze's The Da Vinci Code: The Quest Begins, an isometric adventure game that hops between Swiss banks and lush estates, sending players on a journey to solve a riddle that may shake the very foundations of modern Christianity and Catholicism. Heady stuff, indeed.   Unfortunately, Da Vinci Code is a major bore, plagued by unchallenging puzzles, unfortunate controls, and some maddening decisions regarding game mechanics.   You slip into the tweed jacket of Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon and the daring Sophie Neveu, who may have a bigger part in the unfolding conspiracy that Langdon would ever imagine. You control these two characters together, as if there was an invisible cord between them. You can switch between the two characters at any time, but in an absolutely inexplicable design choice, neither has a special talent that helps in specific situations. This is especially frustrating in many puzzle sections, where you have to leap over laser beams or navigate through gardens, because you always have to worry about the dead weight in the back. Maybe if Sophie had to pull Robert along because only he could illuminate the truths behind paintings or whatnot -- that would make sense and lessen the blow of having to constantly yank a second character around the game screen.   Not helping this matter is the choice of control and camera angle. Isometric on mobile is sometimes a recipe for disaster, and in the case of Da Vinci Code, the disconnect between seeing something to the upper-right, but having to press right to get it is troublesome -- especially when you are trying to wave through a maze to escape a guard. (Interesting observation: Nobody in Da Vinci Code runs. Even when you are fleeing from trouble, you power walk.) Jumping is a pain, too, because you have to line up both characters so they are parallel to each other before making a successful leap.   The puzzles in Da Vinci Code fall into two categories: intellectual and ridiculous. You encounter brainy puzzles like a Cryptex (pictured in the screenshot section) that ask you to answer a riddle. First example: A master of arts and sciences was born in this city in 1452. Now, if you have read the book, you know the answer. If you don't, Google it up. But there are other instances where something seems like a puzzle, but really isn't. You find something cryptic, but then one of the characters conveniently has the answer. (This was a major problem with the book, too, in my opinion.) Other puzzles involve collecting keys to open doors, finding items to thwart enemies, etc. Trust me, there is no getting lost in Da Vinci Code. If there is a locked door, you can be assured that the necessary key is only a screen or two away.   As mentioned, the Da Vinci Code: The Quest Begins is viewed from an isometric angle. I understand the decision on a pure artistic level -- it allows the designers to show you more of the environment than a basic 2D view. Most of the locations look good, such as the Teabing estate and the Louvre museum. The characters are surprisingly large, but not terribly detailed and their animations are limited. It should also be mentioned that there are no actor likenesses used in the mobile game. So, no Hanks mullet for you.  Da Vinci Code: The Quest Begins is not the way I wanted to start the summer movie games season for mobile. Something like this might have been okay a couple years ago, but with so many other good games on the decks, Da Vinci Code: The Quest Begins is impossible to recommend. You will be frustrated by the mechanics over and over again, which really drains any enthusiasm you might have for the source material.
