{"name": "Lucky Luke", "name_review": "Lucky Luke", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/04/lucky-luke", "text": "We all know that saying, ~you get what you pay for.~ Granted, most PlayStation titles eventually make it down to the $20 mark, but when a game launches at that price, you've got to ask yourself, why? And when you play Lucky Luke, it's not very difficult to answer that question.   Lucky Luke is a licensed character from the land of frog's legs, the Eiffel Tower, and classic Jerry Lewis: France. According to sources that happen to know something about this guy, he's apparently a popular cartoon hero that's sweeping the land. And hey, if it's popular, someone has to capitalize on it, right?   Enter Infogrames, who's taken the liberty to design a videogame around Lucky Luke. In this PlayStation game, Lucky Luke is the sheriff of a small, western town, and bad guys are running amok through the dusty roads. Like all good-natured sheriffs, Luke has to take out all the bad guys.   The game switches wildly from an old-school platform game, to an over-the-shoulder game of tennis against a bad guy, to a side-scrolling shooter on the back of a horse and back again. Throughout all the levels, you'll guide Luke over money icons  the more money you have at the end of a level, the more extra lives you can buy at the between-round shops. There's also a few puzzles to solve, but since this game is obviously aimed at kids, there's nothing here that will tax your mentality.  But despite all the variety the game offers, there's a lot wrong with the game. The control is sluggish, the 3D graphics are very first-generation, and the music  well, you can turn that noise down to save your eardrums.   The game may have a very attractive price tag, but there's a price to pay for a game with a low one. In this case, there's a very substandard game inside.  -- Craig Harris", "date": "Nov 4, 1998"}
