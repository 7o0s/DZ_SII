This seemingly simple genre has proven to take much skill on the part of the developer to pull off successfully. It takes more than just an assortment of simple button-mashing mini-games to take a party game to the heights of Nintendo's wildly popular franchise. And in the case of Shrek Super Party, gamers may have more fun fishing with flatulence than boring themselves with this would-be party game.   The Facts   Six playable characters from the Shrek universe Five different environments based on the movie 30 assorted multiplayer mini-games Up to four players can compete Board game like progression or choose your own mini-game   Gameplay Party games or so popular because of how simple they are to just pick of and have a furious competition. Unlike games that require a deep understanding of the controls, or take a lot of practice to master, a simple sentence or two explanation should suffice in instructing the players on how to beat the pants off their friends. As important as simple and clear instructions, controls should also be simple and fluid. Players should never have to fight with the controls more than they have to fight against the other players. Unfortunately Shrek Super Party falls short in these two criteria.  One example of a mini-game that was unclear in its description and frustratingly difficult to control is the Swamp Slalom. In this annoying game players are instructed to ~race around the pond and through the gates for points.~  This would be fine if the developer, Mass Media, decided to also include the control scheme. At the beginning of the race we wasted precious time trying to figure out what button controlled paddling, only to discover pressing up on the control stick was the ticket. Once on our way, steering the canoe was maddeningly slow and imprecise. Needless to say it was far from a simple and fun multiplayer competition.  Most of the mini-games have one thing in common, and that is the lack of fun. Even in the heat (or lukewarm heat) of our competitions we never approached the level of interest that made us want to keep playing. Luckily all of the mini-games are available to access without any unlocking method. This way we were able to get a feel of the variety of Super Party's offerings without having to subject ourselves to the slow pace and tediousness of the main board game ~Tournament~ mode. There are a few fun mini-games, which are mostly based on other successful games. One such game is ~Brick Blasters~ which is almost a carbon copy of pong.  The lack of fun is our main gripe about Shrek Super Party. And isn't that the reason we play games? Maybe with clearer explanations, a quicker pace, and mini-games that are more original and interesting (games you can't win by randomly moving the control stick and hammering A with your eyes closed, i.e. ~Peashooters~), Shrek Super Party would be vastly better than it is. In the current state that it was released to the unsuspecting public, Shrek Super Party is about as exciting as watching lime Jell-O coagulate.   Graphics The Visuals in Shrek Super Party are nice and colorful -- not showpiece stuff, but they do push beyond the level of mediocrity. All the Shrek characters have been given a super deformed makeover, complete with cranial gigantism. The prettiest environments are those that remain stagnant. Other levels that take the player on a more three-dimensional journey suffer from choppy frame rate, and a slower pace. Character animations during mini-games are over simplified and jump from stand still to action, like a flipbook with missing pages. There are a limited number of basic special effects, like a simple particle effect for the stream of water in ~Squirt-A-Snake~.  Mostly standard stuff here, nothing fancy.   Sound The music of Shrek Super Party is one of the game's strongest areas. There are a nice variety of tunes to accompany the mini-games and menus. Sound effects on the other hand are more generic. Boings punctuate jumps, harps flutter when the player racks up points, and flat buzzes signify a failed attempt. While original sound effects would have spruced the game up a bit, they are not necessary for the simple natured party game genre. Sadly, gamers who are looking forward to an immersive Shrek experience will be disappointed at the lack of voice talent utilized in the game. The only vocal offering is the often too chatty Magic Mirror, who serves as narrator to the multiplayer shenanigans.  Overall sound design receives good marks thanks to the engaging soundtrack, but the barely noticeable sound effects and the disappointing lack of Shrek character voices sticks out like a sore thumb.Gamers looking for an engaging multiplayer party experience should stick with the tried-and-true Mario Party series. And for those of you who are die-hard Shrek junkies, (whose spirit wasnt crushed by the last Shrek game) you may want to rent it before you add it to your shrine of happy meal toys.", "date": "Jul 15, 2003"}
