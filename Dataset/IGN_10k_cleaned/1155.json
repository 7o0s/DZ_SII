Unfortunately, the game doesn't quite live up to the standards that the PC version set.                           Take the role of a Warrior, Cleric, or Mage. Each             character-type possesses their own strengths and             weaknesses. The Warrior can't cast as many spells but his hand-to-hand combat comes in handy for close encounters. The Mage, with his lack of strength, is evened out by his magical abilities. Last but not least is the Cleric, who is just about even in all aspects. Increase your abilities by gaining experience through conquering levels and defeating enemies.  Besides the innovative story and idea, the game isn't that great. Compared to the PC version, Hexen is super-pixelated and the textures possess no detail what so ever. The frame-rate is horrible and almost not even worth mentioning. When running, surroundings tend to stutter by as opposed to fluid movement like the PC version.   At first, we were excited to see Hexen port over to the PlayStation. It's a direct port all right, with no additional levels and nothing promising to offer. Hopefully, you won't see this one in your Christmas stocking. Unlike Goldeneye or Turok: Dinosaur Hunter -- the best first-person shooters on N64 so far -- Hexen isn't going to break any new ground. It's ugly, slow and old. A shoddy port of a PC game that wasn't so great to begin with. Wait for something better.", "date": "May 24, 1997"}
