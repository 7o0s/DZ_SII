So every now and again when comedy rears its happy, smiley face and lets out a big hearty, silly laugh, it makes me happy. That's right, happy. It happens to all of us every now and again I guess... Fishtank and newcomer dev team Stormregion were counting on this big hearty happy go lucky in a bugs bunny violent sort of way laugh to carry their new RTS into the top of the charts. While there's certainly a level of class and charm to go along with the laughs and lightheartedness in this war game, there's also more than a little helping of frustration.  While I've been playing a lot of RTS and FPSs lately (that seems to be almost all that comes out for the PC lately), I was actually really looking forward to playing this one. I had seen it in the past and knew that it took a sillier approach to battle pitting rabbits and pigs against each other in the eternal struggle to have farm land to grow corn and carrots... you know the struggle I'm talking about. I look forward to the games that don't take themselves to seriously because I am not, in almost anybody's estimation, a very serious person. And for the first few minutes I was having a good time admiring the beautiful engine, listening to the plethora of soundbytes for each of the units, and commanding rabbits to blow pigs up with cartoonish tanks. Then the game crashed. And crashed. And crashed. I'm not just talking about the silly little crashes the dump you to the desktop or freeze the program so that you can just end task and get on with your business. I'm talking about the bigger burlier crashes that make you turn off the power to your computer in order to restart. And after my finger started bleeding from hitting the power button one too many times, I screamed for a little bit and then decided to take a break. I came back only to have another one of me fingers start bleeding.  It got to the point that I would start saving the game every 30 seconds so that I wouldn't have to go back and do things over again because I knew that it would crash. I can safely say that this darkened the lighthearted approach I was so fondly speaking of earlier to a rather great extent. Instead of having a silly time with the animals, I had a frustrating near death experience when my fist went into the computer screen and I suffered a rather large shock to my system. There's something wrong about spending more time rebooting your computer more than playing the game. All of these problems took place both before and after installing the patch... just for reference, the machine I'm running this on is a 1.4Ghz with 512MB RAM, a GeForce 3, with a Creative SB Live! 5.1 sound system.  But let's not dwell on the bad things... instead, let's move onto to some of the good things that come with the package despite the constant crashing. The look. It's beautiful. The game has bright, gorgeous colors that fill out a very realistic and vibrant cartoony world of happy happy joy joy. The terrain, both in texture and in form was very nice. Towns and bases came to life in amazing 3D from small rabbit villages to big German looking pig towns. The detail that went into all of the textures for each of the buildings was downright amazing. The artists that worked on this stuff should be commended for their eye for this sort of thing.  Vehicles were similarly detailed and looked really nice. I do wish that the tank treads and wheels on the trucks would move, but I guess we can't have everything. The physics engine just added to the vehicles' believability as well. They jolt when hit, suffer some rocking back and forth when stopping and starting, back up and do three point turns to move around... there's a lot happening here. Battles are similarly fun to watch as fire flies from turrets and the explosions that rock the world when vehicles go kaput are amazingly flashy and cartooniliscious at the same time. Once a vehicle has been completely destroyed, parts go flying every which way and a spirit of a rabbit or a pig, depending on who was killed, will go floating up into the sky. Scars will mark the aftermath of the battlefield as well and if you're lucky these scars will be in the shape of a pig or a rabbit. A nice touch, that. But all of this beauty comes at a price of some pretty high requirements that not everyone may have. Take a look over in the box to the right there and see if you aren't impressed.  While we're on the subject of good things, we'll take a turn to the sound. It also is done very well. The accents are goofy (the rabbits are French and the pigs are German by the way) and they were meant to be that way. While the French accents are suspect at times, they are generally fairly entertaining to listen to. And the best part of all of this is that there are a lot of acknowledgements and responses for various situations for each of the units. It adds the spice of variety that many RTSs are missing today.  But if the pretty visuals and sound were all that mattered here, we'd be watching a movie, and we're not. We're participating in a more demanding form of entertainment. S.W.I.N.E. is a tactical RTS. You'll bring in a set group of units with the option of airdropping more in if you have the battle points. The game isn't the worst RTS I've played by a long shot, but it isn't the deepest experience out there and one that most harcore fans will find a little trite and simpleminded at times. AI is the main culprit here. Enemy units aren't exactly the brightest I've ever had the pleasure to face. And between the bouts of crashing when I was able to play the game, I found it pretty predictable and easy to manipulate. There were a couple of occasions when an enemy unit came at me from behind and did some damage where I couldn't manuver out of the way, it basically just ran straight at me and shot at whatever was closest, not really bothering to pick the smart targets that would cause me the most harm. Often I was able to plop artillery in enemy unit's laps without them even bothering to move their position to save themselves. There was no organized team thinking attack here either which was a bit dissapointing.  Friendly AI also had it's fair share of problems. Pathfinding was usually fairly good except in some circumstances where it was impatient. Bringing units across a bridge was downright frustrating. The minute a unit bumped into one in front of it, it would start to turn around to go another way assuming there was no way through instead of just waiting for the vehicle in front to get out of the way. And when a tank tries to do a 3 point turn on a bridge, there's bound to be a little bit of backup which'll cause the rest of the vehicles behind it to do the same thing. I ended up having to order one unit across at a time in order to move across. Units would also often bump into objects such as trees and need several tries to get where they were going. This is pretty horrible when in the middle of a battle and reinforcements are needed. Crack fighters these beasties are not.  There were also a pretty limited number of different types of units (10 controllable on each side) to deal with and against in the game. In fact, both sides had the same weaponry with different looks with the exception of one unique vehicle on each side. Instead of taking advantage of the subject matter to create some more fun filled weapons and silliness, the design team opted towards conventional weapons such as tanks, artillery, rocket launchers, mortars, and even airstrikes. While the units and weapons do have that cartoonish look to them, they don't have the cartoonish feel.  However, units did hold value as they progressed through the game and gained levels and became more efficient. It's always a nice touch to make you care a little more about keeping your troops alive. You also have the opportunity to upgrade your units in three slots. You can choose from armor, fuel and ammo upgrades or go for mine detection, extra sight, or repair packs. These are helpful and sometimes very necessary to completing a mission.  The vehicle I had the most fun with was the tow truck which haulled around the repair, refuling, and rearming trailers. It always managed to back up all the way from where ever you gave it the order to hitch up to one of these things. Funny as hell. The trailers themselves were neat as well, with their nifty animations, but I'm not sure I liked having to refuel my vehicles. Repairing and rearming, sure. Refueling was just annoyance. For the short amount of distances these things were traveling, they shouldn't have needed fuel.  So at the moment, until they get these problems fixed, I can't really recommend this one. Even without the problems it's a little bit shallow compared to much of the competition in terms of gameplay. But if you've had it with the seriousness that goes into most titles out ther, or if you're just looking for something pretty that sounds good, keep your eyes open for more patches and consider looking this one up again in the future.  -- Dan Adams      Want to share your opinions with the world?
