However, PixelJunk Monsters, recently released on the PlayStation Store, is an incredible improvement over Q-Games' previous effort and boasts some of the most addictive and enjoyable gameplay we've seen in a while.   PixelJunk Monsters happily belongs to the ~tower defense~ genre of games, where your sole objective is -- generally speaking -- to construct a series of towers in a certain environment and attempt to fend off attackers from reaching your base or a goal. This premise is very familiar to us, but it's executed with great precision and care in Monsters, and that's what makes this title stand out.    Throughout the game, you guide a small, admittedly charming character around forest environments, defending your tribe of helpless little creatures. Each monster that gets through your defenses will kill one of your tribe until none remain. Stopping the diverse types of monsters is all about building the right tower in the right place at the right time. But before we delve into the game's advanced tactics, let's discuss the basics.   PixelJunk Monsters gives you control of the battlefield through the hands of a single character. In this game, you have three primary resources at your disposal: trees, coins and gems. Trees act as your template. You can build any type of tower on any tree on the field, assuming you have sufficient coins, which you collect from fallen enemies. While coins build towers, gems give you access to quick upgrades, or you can spend them on researching more powerful types of towers, which you can then build at any time.   Over the bridge they go. This may sound complex, but playing PixelJunk Monsters is surprisingly easy (at first). It helps that interacting with your character is a breeze -- just move with the d-pad or analog stick, press X to confirm and O to cancel. Walking up to a tree will highlight it, and hitting X will bring up a small circular menu where you can select which tower to build on that tree. Once the tower is complete, it will automatically attack passing monsters that are within range. Your interaction with the tower doesn't stop there, however. Standing on it will cause your character to dance (quite joyfully, it seems) and dancing slowly upgrades your tower to improve its power, range, and other important attributes. Or, you can select a tower and spend gems to get an instant boost of stats. Finally, you also have the ability to deconstruct said tower and get some of your coins/gems back, which is handy when you're in a tight spot.   That's essentially the game in a nutshell. Each stage, accessed from a simple but vibrant world map, offers you a different locale with a set number of waves of enemies. At the end of all the waves (the total of which varies depending on the difficulty of the stage), you usually square off against a boss monster, which slowly marches towards your tribe and will continue to stomp them to death if not dealt with. We can assure you that no sight is more depressing than watching your adorable little village get pulverized by a renegade baddie. Sigh.   Preventing such tragedy is challenging, but made possible by your collection of towers. You have quite a selection to choose from, including ones that launch arrows, fire cannon balls and even shoot lasers. This is clearly a very advanced tribe.     Q-Games has done a marvelous job balancing the broad range of monsters and towers, as well as provide a healthy number of levels. Progressing further through the game's difficulty levels requires that you clear a stage without any casualties, unlocking a rainbow for that stage. There are also special levels with unique rules or restrictions to spice things up, as well as stages that reward you with a special ability upon completion.   Overall, the fun of Monsters comes from its fantastic foundation in both real-time strategy and casual play. It's easy enough to jump right into and get hooked on, but it has enough depth to keep you engaged. There's a surprising amount of strategy at work, and real skill is required to survive some of the later levels. Your opponents, who start off weak and delightfully ~explodable,~ will eventually sport boosted health, shields, and a resilience against certain towers.    Great gameplay isn't the only thing that PixelJunk Monsters has going for it. The art style, while incredibly simple, is crisp and appealing. Furthermore, the game runs well, regardless of how many monsters are on the screen -- and there will be many. There are also leaderboards in place, as well as a full two-player mode that lets you work cooperatively to defend your home. Although enemy attack patterns don't appear to change much for two-player (if at all), the option is still welcome and is sure to please gamers looking for a casual title to play with a friend.   We can't forget to mention that Monsters also supports Remote Play, which we were quite impressed with. Although the game obviously runs a bit slower, with greatly reduced image fidelity, it's still more than playable and a fantastic option for gamers on the go. This type of gameplay translates to the portable well, and a little bit of lag won't entirely impair your ability to enjoy the experience. Playing on the PS3 is ideal, of course.   Ultimately though, the game is not without flaws. Attempting to get a perfect run on certain stages can be extremely frustrating, because after twenty minutes of gameplay, a single monster can sneak through your defenses and put all your efforts to waste -- there's no way to start over mid-stage. And while the leaderboards are definitely a great feature, online co-op would have been nice as well. Most importantly: enemy patterns never change, which can be a blessing and a curse. While you can improve your efforts with each successive try, knowing what's coming can take away from the improvisation and creativity needed in a lot of strategy titles. This is easily the game's greatest flaw, though it still doesn't detract much from the fun you'll have while playing.   Marching away. The year is already looking up, because PixelJunk Monsters is a highly addictive game that's absolutely worth a download. If you enjoy casual games but prefer a more engaging experience, this is the title for you. As long as you're wary of the high level of challenge and trial-and-error based gameplay, you won't be disappointed.", "date": "Jan 29, 2008"}
