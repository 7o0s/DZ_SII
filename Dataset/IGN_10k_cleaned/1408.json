Of course, we can't be at our PCs 24 hours a day, seven days a week (stay out of this, Schneider), so it's good to know that the games that were only available on the computer side of things are making their way to another medium...the Game Boy Color.  And what's more, these games are a lot of fun to play even on the Nintendo portable, despite one major design omission: battery save. Features Six original puzzle-style games Hundreds of levels Adjustable difficulty settings Only for Game Boy Color Microsoft Puzzle Collection is a six-pack of highly-enjoyable, well-produced brainteasers that originally made the gaming circuit as tiny Windows applications  but instead of taking up a floppydisc amount of space on your hard drive, they've been smooshed onto a Game Boy Color cartridge. And they are: Jewel Chase. Control a gloved hand around a maze of color, grabbing all the valuable items before heading to the exit. The hook is, you can only move on the same colored platforms  the only way to get to a different colored set of platforms is to find a block that's your current color and a different color. You'll have to snag keys to unlock gated areas, and you can only leave the level once all the items have been picked up. The game is a lot of fun, but you have to make sure you play it on any difficulty other than beginner  only then will there be a challenge, since in harder difficulties will there be a computer opponent to beat. If he gets out of the level before you do, the game's over. Spring Weekend. This game's a lot like those slide-tile puzzles with a slight twist...literally. You have to rotate the series of icons to form the same pattern of icons that's in the upper right of the screen. It's a challenge much like Rubik's Cube, since aligning one icon in the right position before the others wouldn't be the right strategy to take. Early levels are a snap, only requiring one or two steps, but wait until you get into the teens. Taxing! Lineup. Microsoft's own style of Tetris without the moving pieces  you've got to fit groups of five beads on a grid, trying to form complete vertical and horizontal lines of beads. You can't rotate the pieces early on, so it takes careful placement to form the lines  when a line is formed, all the groups that were responsible for the line disappears. In later levels you can rotate pieces using bonus moves, but these opportunities are few and far between. And in harder levels, you have to put up with neutral spots on the board. The game ends when you run out of space on the grid. Finty Flush. This unique puzzle game is another ~Tetris~ variant where you have to fit vertical ball groupings onto four different grids. When you fill up an entire grid by rotating and placing the balls, the grid wipes clean. You can freely swap between four grids in case you need more space to work with, but once you run out of room the game's over. Later levels throw different colored balls into the mix, making it more difficult since the balls disappear only when the grid's full of the same colored balls. Rat Poker. It's like Lemmings, but you have to keep the same colored mice together by trapping them temporarily and swapping mice with other colors. They'll only wander off the screen when three or more of the same colored mice stick together, and in later levels you can create Poker hands (like a full house). And when the screen is overrun by the rodents the game's over. A definite programming feat having all those sprites moving at the same time...impressive in graphics and in gameplay. Color Collision Easily the weakest game of the bunch, this game puts you in control of a Qix-like snake where you have to collide with same-colored smily-faces. When you wipe out the set quota of each level, you move onto the next.  Each game (with the exception of Color Collision) is a well-produced, unique challenge with professional graphics and a nice tune (though repetitive  you can kill the music at the beginning of the game). As a compilation pack of games, it's worth the bucks and a great addition to your Game Boy Color library.  That doesn't mean it's perfect...oh, no. There's one serious problem with this pack: no battery save. Heck, there's no password, either, which means the game will never remember the progress you've made on any of the six games in the pack. If you get up to level 20 in Jewel Chase, for example, the game will never keep that in memory when you grow tired of the game and power-down. The designers worked around this omission by allowing players to access any level in any of the games. Which also means the score you accumulate in any of the challenges is lost as well. If I were producing this game, I would have put my fist down and demanded the game require a battery...the extra buck per cart would have been worth it.  Relateldly, there's no option to quit the game and go back to the main menu...another design flaw.  I really enjoy playing Microsoft Puzzle Collection, since each of the games are a lot of fun to pick up and kick around. I just wish everything you've done would have been recorded to memory in some fashion  at the very least, the game should have a password to access the later levels in the game. To be able to access any level whenever you want kills the replay value somewhat. The game needs that drive to continue forward...to reward you for your brains and fast fingers. But with the design omissions in mind, this pack is a great one.", "date": "Oct 27, 2000"}
