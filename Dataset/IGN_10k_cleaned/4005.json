It's about coming up big on D, elevating your game to the next level, and batting that dunk back into the stands. It's about freestyle, ankle-breaking moves, where all the defender can do is sit and marvel at your Air Force Ones as you rise toward the rim.   It's one of the best head-to-head sports games to hit shelves this year. It also has its fair share of problems that hold it back from a true title run.   Call Live the New Jersey Nets of hoop games if you will. Excitement and entertainment is what they bring to the court, but there's always someone just a bit better waiting in the wings. A fun time on the floor, no doubt, even if it is at the same time flawed.   The Game  The single best thing about NBA Live 2004 is the continued innovations brought to the game's control. Last season saw the introduction of Freestyle into the mix. This year, Freestyle is back, although toned down for the better, while two new additions to player control make Live the tightest controlling baller to date.   The first thing you'll notice is that there are now two different shoot buttons. One is for jumpers, the other is for dunks. No longer will you complain about a two-foot jumper from the lane when you wanted to jam, and likewise, you can now pull up for a jumper if you don't feel like challenging Yao at the rim. This makes a huge difference in terms of gameplay, is learned quite quickly, and really helps take player control to that superstar level. On top of that, you can also now adjust your shot in mid-air. Hit one of the shoot buttons once to go up for the shot, but if the defender is in your way, you can hit the same shoot button a second time to make a mid-air adjustment and attempt your shot from a different angle.

Get The Guide | See Other Guides   The second and coolest new control mechanism is what EA Sports likes to call the ~pro hop~. Also known as traveling to most b-ball purists, the pro hop can be seen in every real NBA game, so naturally, if it's in the game... you know the rest. The pro hop is used to split defenders and hop toward the hoop on two feet. It enables the ball handler to quickly penetrate the lane then combo the move with one of the two shoot buttons to hit a leaner, fade-away, or elevate for the slam. If you're a big man like Shaq or Yao (yes, he's finally made it into polygonal form), the pro hop turns more into a power dribble that forces your way into the lane where once again you have the choice to shoot or go up strong for the jam.    And go up strong you must as the defensive AI has been ramped up to such a high degree; you're going to hear the whine of a lot of wannabe hoopsters calling for their mamma. Not only does the computer defense properly rotate and double team the ball, they defend the rim with the ferocity of five Kenyon Martin's. There's definitely a learning curve, as you're going to need to pass the rock around the perimeter and look for the open man, or hit cutters as they roll toward the basket.   One way to do this is to actually play as one of the offensive men without the ball. With a quick tap of a button, you can actually control any man on the court and leave it up to your point guard to run the offense you've called. This way, you can let Jason Kidd handle the ball along the perimeter and take control of the likes of Richard Jefferson, weaving in and out of bodies as you try to spot up for the three or call for the alley-oop. In multi-player games, this adds an extra dimension to the gameplay, because the player on defense might choose to defend the ball, or he could switch defenders to cover the offensive player running around in a game of cat and mouse, Kidd and Play, Stephon and Man-Child, or whatever team you like to run with.   Like I mentioned earlier, the days of hitting Freestyle control and effortlessly gliding to the hoop are over. That's in part to the defense, and in part to the reigns being tightened on Freestyle. No longer will Shaq be able to shake a defender like with a killer crossover ala Tim Hardaway. Those glory days are gone like the days Warrior fans hoped that this really was their year. Instead, Freestyle is more for the point guards, the slashers, and players with handles. If you've got game, you can still break down your defender. If you don't, you won't, it's that simple.    What's not simple is actually trying to make a jump shot. Yes, a jump shot. Part of the reason why Live has an arcade-feel to it is the fact that every time down the court, you either drive to the lane for an attempted dunk or you hoist a three pointer. The mid range jumper is completely gone from the game for two reasons: 1. The defense rotates so fast on mid-range shots, you need to make the extra pass either outside or inside. 2. The higher the difficulty, the less likely you are to sink a shot. The second of these examples is the most frustrating because if you do everything right, i.e. find the open man from 12-feet away, you should be rewarded. And while you're rewarded for this extra pass from the three-point line or inside the lane, when you shoot from anywhere in between, the biggest reward you can hope for is getting fouled so at least you can earn your points from the charity stripe. Sure you can still make the occasional shot, but not anywhere near the percentage you should, especially considering that these guys are supposed to be pros.   As you play the game, you're given a list of both individual and team goals that, when accomplished, you're rewarded with points that you can later spend in the NBA Store. There you can purchase all of your favorite Nike shoes like Air Jordans, a pair of matching socks, new headbands, or even a fancy throwback from your favorite team's heyday. You can then go in and equip these accessories on your favorite players, although not all accessories can be used in all modes.   Speaking of modes, NBA Live steps to the court with a host of gameplay options, including Season, Dynasty, Playoffs, 1-on-1, and even practice. There's a handy tutorial that helps you learn the finer points of the game from the triple threat to playing good D. The majority of the single-player experience, however, is played in Dynasty mode, the mode that enables you top play the role of General Manger, coach, and player as you take your favorite team through multiple season of competition. Forget calling this mode Dynasty, though. It should really be called Clint Eastwood because it's littered with various degrees of good, bad, and ugly.    First the good: As you play through the mode, almost everything you do have a cinematic attached. You train your players to play better defense, you see them on the practice court swatting balls and ripping the rock. You release a player from the team, you see him in his suit walk out of the locker room dejected. Sign a player, and he'll be greeted by his new teammates with a pound. Draft a rookie, and you watch as he gets up from his table and walks toward the stage to meet David Stern. You can also hire assistant coaches to help train your players for a set period of games and watch as their attribute points increase in these skill areas like dribbling or shooting. You can edit the look of your players by adding new tats, pads, shoes, or even adjusting the height of their socks. Plus, you can do all of the GM duties such as trade, sign, and release players.   The gameplay during Dynasty, or Eastwood if you will, is where you might start getting mad, as the higher the difficulty level, the fiercer the computer will storm back and beat you in the fourth quarter. It's like all of a sudden, your team gets ice cold, but the computer can drain fade-aways from the arc like he's standing under the basket. Sure, the better you get at the game, the better you'll get at holding off the late charge, but it can get frustrating when you have a ten point lead and watch it wilt away like your players are standing still.   The ugly part of the game comes in the free agent market. Instead of money, you are given points to sign and resign players. If you don't treat your players right during the season by getting them the right coaches or give them enough playing time, some will refuse to re-sign with your team, and due to the salary cap, you can get into a jam where you don't have very many points to spend and three or four players who refuse to sign contracts. What do you do if this happens? Well, this is where you find maybe the biggest glitch in the game.    In your second season and beyond, if you skip the free agent signing period and move on to the season; you can then go back into Sign Free Agents in the Roster Management section. Here, not only will find that the computer teams failed to sign any of your players, they failed to sign basically any of the free agents on the market. You can then go in and sign every star in the league who's available at the league minimum, stacking your team for the upcoming season with players like Iverson, Ray Allen, and whoever else is available at the time. Also, since you save so much money by signing everyone to the minimum, you can then use all of your point to train your star players, making them that much better, and basically ensuring that you win the title.   Graphics  The first thing you notice when you start a game is the realistic way the players move on the court. Thanks to the first ever ten-man motion capture; you'll see everyone on court acting like they would on a real NBA floor. Players battle for post position, defenders keep and eye on the ball at all times, you'll see superstars dive on the court for loose balls, and slashers calling for alley oops as they cut toward the basket.   But while the mo-cap adds realism, the player models themselves are anything but realistic looking. The Live team took great strides forward in incorporating the realistic heads for most of the stars in the game, but it's nothing compared to the fact that ESPN NBA Basketball has the realistic head modeling for every player in the NBA, not just the stars. The players themselves also don't have the detail down to every tat like ESPN, and when you look at both games side by side, there really is no comparison.   One area that has been improved, however, is the fact that for the first time Live features the authentic arenas from around the NBA. This include everything from championship banners (if your team has any), and retired jerseys hanging from the rafters.   Sound  Marv ~I want to bite you in the ass~ Albert and the Czar of the Telestrator Mike Fratello command the booth, and actually provide the best commentary of any of the basketball games this year. They provide entertaining banter, keep with the flow of the action, and comment about the game you're playing in a seemingly intelligent manner. The soundtrack also rocks, thanks to a lineup of great artists like Chingy, Outkast, Black Eyed Peas, Mobb Deep, Clipse, Sean Paul, and Freeway.Like every game from EA, it's only online for the PS2. So if you have multiple systems that's the one to get. Otherwise the game is pretty much identical across the board. Thanks to Live's controls and in-your-face gameplay, it's one of the better basketball games to hit the cyber court this year, even if it is more of a two-player arcade game, rather than a sim.Any way you look at it though, the game is fun, even if it does have some flaws that keep it from the top of the list.", "date": "Oct 14, 2003"}
