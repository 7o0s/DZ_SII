Well, add another one to the collection: Top Gear Rally 2, the first true sequel to a Top Gear game since the SNES days. Or is it?Interestingly, Top Gear Rally 2 is not developed by Boss Game Studios and uses a completely different graphics and physics engine. I have to admit that I was a bit worried when I first heard that Kemco was handing over the reigns for Top Gear Rally 2 to a new developer. After all, few games manage to come even close to the physics and four-point suspension system found in Boss Games' racer -- and developer Saffire isn't exactly known for its racing games, either. To make things worse, the unfinished version of TGR2 Kemco showed off at E3 was certainly nowhere near the quality of the previous Top Gear Rally...Luckily, the final version of TGR2 serves as an important reminder that you should never assume anything. Top Gear Rally 2 is as interesting a game as the first one -- even though it has almost nothing to do with its predecessor. If anything, TGR2 is more like the original Top Gear games.The Facts More than 15 different car models, including fully licensed rides by Mitsubishi, Subaru and Toyota. Rally driving school to develop skills. American Rally Sport Group license. Four-player versus mode. Two-player team racing. Random track generator will offer new point-to-point courses once initial tracks are cleared. Car damage will affect vehicle performance (ie, busted tires will create drag). Modify car suspension, handling, speed in Team Support Van. Five racing divisions. Rumble Pak support.GameplayTop Gear Rally 2 plays nothing like Top Gear Rally 1. Whereas the original featured a realistic physics model with a very slippery feel, TGR2 handles like Beetle Adventure Racing in the dirt. Like the Beetles in Paradigm's racer, the rally cars in this game don't feel very heavy at all and virtually turn on a dime, thanks in part to the inclusion of a handbrake. Also, you can't flip your car this time around and the four-point suspension system is gone as well. Is this a bad thing? Well, on one hand, the simulation aspects of the original have been dumbed down by offering what is essentially an arcade rally experience -- but once you actually play through the game's Championship mode, you realize that the controls have been simplified for a reason.Unlike most racers in the rally genre, TGR2 actually brings something new to the plate. Unlike in Top Gear Rally, banging into obstacles and other cars has its consequences in TGR2. Almost every part of your car can break down. Drive over a large rock and your muffler will fall off. Speed over railroad tracks without slowing down and your tires blow. Submerge your engine in water for too long and you'll short-circuit your board computer and display lights. Brakes? Dump valves? Gear box? Drive train? If your car's got it -- it can break. Naturally, a broken component causes your car to handle and, in some cases, even sound differently. With the exception of the tires, which can be fixed during the race, car parts can only be repaired at the end of the race in the support van. But the repairs aren't free. Not only do you have to spend your hard-earned cash on new parts, but you also receive time penalties that delay your start at the next leg of the championship.Speaking of which, championships are no longer season-based. In TGR2, you first sign up with a specific racing team (sadly, the lacking menu design doesn't let you see the team's car until you actually sign up), then enroll in a Cup Championship. Each cup race is made up of multiple races on various terrain types, including mud, asphalt, sand and snow. Unlike in the predecessor, TGR2's races aren't circuit-based but take you on a more accurate point-to-point race that's broken down into different legs. The four cars that participate in the races don't start at the same time either -- but TGR2 doesn't do this as a cheap way to minimize the amount of cars on screen (the arcade mode actually starts off all four cars at the same time), but to accurately mimic American Rally Sport Group rules. If someone starts ahead of you and finishes before you, you can still come in first if your time is better than your opponent's. If you win a race, you are rewarded with money to upgrade your ride, new sponsorship deals (in the form of decals that appear on your car) and championship points that open up new cup races and get you more team offers. You have to work really hard to open up some of the later, licensed rides such as the Toyota Corolla WRC. Luckily, even the earlier cars (like everyone's favorite Stratos) are very fast -- a far cry from the sluggish early rides in the original Top Gear Rally. As an extra bonus for players who finish all the regular cups, you even get a random track generator that churns out different course variations based on pre-made track elements.The game even takes a cue from Sony's Gran Turismo and offers a rally driving school that helps your develop your skills for the real races. The different challenges range from driving with the wrong tires or broken equipment parts to parking the car or braking on a wet surface. It's a cool little extra to play around with when you're not in the mood to race a whole cup.While the graphics and physics are not as slick as in the original TGR, the game succeeds beautifully in offering a rally experience unlike any other. The fact that your cars can break down is only one element TGR2 pulls off exceptionally well. More than anything else, TGR2 really makes you feel like you're driving on varying terrain types. As you skid through mud, dirt particles fly through the air and hit your windshield, and along with rain and fog limits your vision, and cacti threaten to pop your tires if you're not careful. Blow a tire and you have the choice of continuing on (slowly, though) or pulling over for a quick tire change. It's just like real rally racing -- even if the tire changes are executed by some unknown force that lifts up the side of your car...On the multiplayer front, TGR2 goes back to the roots of the series by offering not only a four-player versus mode, but also the two-player championship mode that was so sorely absent from the last Top Gear Rally. Two players can now even team up and race a team championship against a computer team. Framerates suffer greatly in the multiplayer modes, but the game remains very playable. The only real flaw is that tire changes are executed via the Start button in the two-player mode, which freezes the game momentarily for both players.GraphicsTop Gear Rally 2's graphics are a mixed bag. The cars are definitely a step up from the predecessor and some of the environments are nicely detailed (the desert track looks great) -- but like in Rainbow Six, Saffire's texture designs lack definition, making the game come across as a bit on the blurry side. Also, the cool overlay textures and use of shadows we've become accustomed to from games like Banjo-Kazooie are absent for the most part. While the overall look is still above average, everything looks a little too drab to leave a lasting impression with racing game fans accustomed to the likes of World Driver Championship or Beetle Adventure Racing. Framerates are consistent, but not as smooth as in TGR1.However, where this game does stand out is in the special effects department. There are so many little details here that it makes you wonder why other racing games can't do the same. Your tires kick up mud when you drive in the rain, which incrementally accumulates on your car. Water splashes on your windshield when you drive through puddles. Driving through deeper water washes off any dirt that may have accumulated. Rain hits your windshield, making it harder to see. Your tires kick up plenty of dust and sand in the desert races. If it's wet sand, it will stick to your car. Your car leaves trails in the snow. Lightning flashes on rainy days. Bugs and stones hit your windshield, leaving marks that gradually fades away. The list goes on and on. Special effects like these may not seem like much in the grand scheme of things, but once you play TGR2 you realize that all of the little stuff adds up. The outcome is a racing experience that feels all the more real, whether the physics are realistic, or not.SoundThe ~Jackal's~ New Age tunes that have been a staple of the Top Gear series for so long have been retired. While that may be a good thing for those who found the music to be a tad too ~relaxing~ to befit a racing game, they have been replaced with what can best be described as the most generic music ever. Thankfully, the sound effects are much better. Depending on the team you picked, a different co-pilot calls out directions, the engine sounds are much better than in the original TGR and there is great variety of road noise, damage and splash sounds to go along with the visuals. Wreck your drive train and it will rattle for the remainder of the race. Bust your muffler and your engine will roar so loud you almost feel embarrassed to drive too close to your competitors. Good stuff.My initial impression that TGR2 was just another generic rally racer changed as soon as I actually spent some quality time with the game's championship mode. It may not have its predecessor's slick visuals and advanced physics, but TGR2 still emerges as a very playable, and most importantly, unique rally experience. Just look at all the features Saffire added to raise the bar for console rally racing: vehicle upgrades, team-based racing, sponsorship support, equipment breakdown, rally school driving, car/terrain interaction, random track generation, and so on. As crowded as the N64 racing genre is, this game offers something unique that's well worth your attention. Another quality Top Gear title from Kemco. I can't wait to see what this series does on Dolphin...", "date": "Dec 7, 1999"}
