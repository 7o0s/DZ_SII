We unwrapped our copy of Monster Trux Arenas, looked at the disc label, booted the game up, and began playing.  A funny thing happened when we got to the title screen though; we began doubting if this review was already written, and if this game was in fact already played.  We know this interface, we've seen these icons, and we've played this game.  Did we already review it?   Yet another piece of shovelware by Conspiracy Entertainment, Monster Trux Arenas draws its inspiration from Offroad Extreme! Special Edition in the way that identical twins would draw inspiration from each other's facial features.  They are, in fact, almost the same game.    Yup.  It's basically the same game as Offroad Extreme.  Here's the formula that was followed between Monster Trux Arenas and Offroad Extreme: Take what could have been a deeper multi-vehicle experience, and rip the game in half.  Take the offroad cars and tracks, package them up, and charge a cool $30.  Game one is now called Offroad Extreme! Special Edition.  The exclamation point will get casual buyers excited, and the ~Special Edition~ makes them think the game was so good the first time, the publisher just had to release another one due to popular demand.  As for the second half of your game, grab all the monster trucks and levels, keep the same interface, control, and in-game icons, and put it in its own game.  Label this one Monster Trux Arenas (with an x, so we know it's totally extreme), and again charge $30.   The two titles are nearly identical.  You've got the game gameplay issues, the same sluggish control, the same muddy, sloppy interface, and the same generic music.  All HUD icons, the cash system, and boost mechanic are all identical across these two games.  In fact, the VO that plays during the title screen of Monster Trux Arenas actually says ~Monster Trux Extreme.~  Looks like the people recording the VO even thought Offroad Extreme and Monster Trux were going to be the same game.  Or, perhaps, it's just old VO from the PC game.   Sneaky sneaky.  Monster Trux Arenas is the same game as Offroad Extreme! Special Edition, with a quick vehicle swap and different levels.  Everything else is literally the same, and its painfully obvious that Conspiracy had Data Design Interactive make a full game, and the split it in two right before release.  In fact, we may be wrong on that front, as there are still more shovelware games to root through.  Was there supposed to be cars in the game too?  What about motorcycles?  Just how many titles were squeezed out of one design?With that being said, weve taken inspiration from this design choice.  Below youll find Matt Casamassinas new take on Monster Trux Arenas.  Never mind the fact that 99% of the text is the same as his Offroad Extreme! review.  The name is changed, so weve got a new review.", "date": "Feb 6, 2008"}
