{"name": "Aero Dancing F: Todoroki Tsubasa no Hatsu Hikou", "name_review": "Aero Dancing F (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/03/aero-dancing-f-import", "text": "Pulling off a solid flight simulator on a game console is one helluva trick ? and adding dogfighting into the mix is even trickier. While CRI's original Aero Dancing delighted aerobatics fans with realistic flight controls and a plethora of training missions, everyone else was dying to slide into a cockpit and kill some stuff. The full-blown sequel, entitled Aero Dancing F, has stepped up to fill the dogfighting void ? but can it balance realism with actual fun?  At the title screen, Aero Dancing F gives you two choices for control: Normal and Real. While the Normal mode gives you a somewhat arcadey (but still realistic) flight model, Real mode implements blackouts from G-forces, and is more in touch with true-to-life flying. As a whole, Aero Dancing F is a surprisingly open-ended game ? you can pound through the training missions or tactical challenges, or just engage in some good old-fashioned free flight.  Most gamers will opt to go through the Fighter Missions ? of which the first dozen or so teach you preparatory maneuvers, from the Split S to the Immelmann Turn. Thanks to the game's incredibly strict grading system, you'll learn these moves flawlessly ? at the cost of your own sanity. At times, the game's grading is just flaky, and frequently unfair. You'll quickly grow to despise the screaming Japanese announcer, who verbally berates you with every screw-up. Students of Japanese will become quite familiar with the Japanese aerobatic terms ? and the wording for ~Try again, lameass~ ? should they choose to import this game.  My biggest irk with the Fighter Missions is how you have to complete them before unlocking the juicy missions. Some of us have been cutting our teeth on flight sims since we were in the crib (I fondly remember Dynamix's godly Aces of the Pacific on the PC), and do we really need to prove we know how to do a flawless 360-degree turn before we can get to the good stuff?  Thank goodness a ton of ~Tactical Challenges~ are available from the get-go. These range from mundane balloon-shooting to encounters with multiple enemies, and introduce you to some solid dogfighting against crafty AI. To shape your own missions, you can jump into the ~Free Flight~ mode, where you select a location, and place enemies in the relative vicinity. Sadly, you can't bring wingmen along for the ride, so it's essentially you against the world. I also would have appreciated more variety in the fighters from the start, without having to go through the whole ~unlocking~ process.   The control is as good as it gets on a seven-button controller ? while analog is used for flight controls, the digital pad changes camera views, activates the airbrake, or raises and lowers the landing gear. A and B control throttle, Y shoots, and X triggers a free-look mode, where your player's head follows whatever target is in range. To be honest, using the ASCII Mission Stick is your best bet, though the stock controller is more than passable.  The original game's replay mode has come through intact, and you can save your greatest hits (or misses, for that matter) to a VMU. You can tinker with camera angles to create your own Top Gun, and ? get this ? hop back into the game at any time during the replay. Plow into a building by accident? You can time-warp yourself five seconds before it happened, and save your bacon. Very nice!  For those of you craving one-on-one combat with your best buddies, Aero Dancing F has a split-screen two-player mode, along with link cable support (woohoo!). You'll need to be good at missile evasion, though ? otherwise, the guy who shoots first usually wins. Damn long-range missiles ? too bad there's no real way to change your weapon load outs. You can't choose where you want to battle your buddy, either ? it's always over the open sea (frame rate is probably a consideration here). Aero Dancing F looks a hair more impressive than the original game, with smoother plane models and decent ? though very flat-looking ? environments. Then again, there's no slowdown or visible LOD management problems, so I can't complain. But I will bitch about the crash explosions, as they completely suck: when I plow an F-16 into the ground at mach 2, I want more than some cheesy-ass explosion sprite ? give me a friggin' polygonal mushroom cloud! Take note, whoever may be localizing this game for US release. Aero Dancing F's music isn't great, but the vocals approach a new layer of hideousness. The rock music is bad enough without the ridiculous lyrics, which make ~Highway to the Danger Zone~ sound like Dylan in comparison. Also questionable is the machinegun firing sound, which closely resembles flatulation. Hmm.  All in all, Aero Dancing F is an okay little dogfighting game ? but it's lacking a ton of features that PC users have been accustomed to for years. Anyone who enjoyed the first Aero Dancing and has the craving for a little conflict should enjoy themselves ? as for me, I'll go back to Falcon 4.0 on my PC. -- Colin ~JAL Monkey~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Mar 3, 2000"}
