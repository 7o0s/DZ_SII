If he can cause sufficient amounts of panic without being discovered and dissected, he'll be able to return to his home planet a hero. That's the gist of Under the Skin, from the same company that created Viewtiful Joe. Unfortunately for us, lighting isn't striking twice.Under the Skin looks like Jet Set Radio and comes off like a quirky twist on classic Spy vs. Spy, but ultimately turns out to be little more than a cutely animated, stylishly put together exercise in monotony. Cosmi is capable of capturing and then taking the form of nearly any human inhabitant he sees. Each form of person comes with five unique pranks. Cosmi uses these pranks on the civilian population, which causes them to shower the streets in gold coins he can then collect to complete levels. Once these five pranks bound to a single person are depleted, a new form must be taken. Should any currently used form be twice struck down by angry civilians, the pranks of competitive aliens, or vicious motorists, Cosmi will revert to his normal alien self, at which point the entire game world will attempt to subdue him. Each sustained blow when exposed results in the loss of a large number of coins. Since the objective of the game is to collect coins in allocated time (sometimes with obvious spins directly related to which map Cosmi is currently playing on), it's important also to not get discovered or beaten up. The assumption of a variety of distinct human forms to avoid being detected by other panicky humans sounds intriguing. The use of traps to cause panic and mischief sounds enticing. The design looks appealing... But, Under the Skin is in actuality a painfully straightforward game that rarely proves to be anything better than mediocre.  Come Skate with Me There are several major problems that make this so. The first and most important is that the use of any of the pranks barely qualifies as interesting. It is neat to be able to turn into a large flying alien or summon a group of sharks to harass and devour nearby people, but since every prank is so totally random and so totally outrageous, they eventually manage to belittle one another and thus lose any real impact they might have otherwise had. After the first play you'll ask yourself why you're so often stuck using half of them? Had Under the Skin played more off the environment and the characters than some  clichd staples of ancient comedy like a springy boxing glove and some thumbtacks, this might not have been a problem. Instead, we get a bag of tricks and we mash a button to throw them at people.Another serious issue is that Under the Skin often hits players with maps that are so similar in terms of gameplay, it often feels like dj vu. Even if the pranks change cosmetically, they're still just explosions or missiles or randomly patrolling objects that force more coins to fly in the air. Even if the environments change, you're still just throwing crap at people to get coins so that you can...get some more coins. It's pass and it just keeps on going.It's always the same forward and back moseying to acquire more coin and it's never particularly enjoyable. In fact, had you swapped out the variety of pranks for a simple club, Under the Skin wouldn't even be worth the 6.0 rental that it is, but then aren't the available pranks just differently colored clubs? That's what it boils down to: Players are asked to do simple, boring things so that they can achieve a simple, boring conclusion.Under the Skin is a fleeting novelty. There simply isn't any substance to backup this idea. After the first level, I experienced everything I would from the rest of the game, which never got more difficult or varied, save for a few gimmicky objectives that found themselves tacked onto certain maps.Despite what it may look like, this is not a particularly clever game. It's about dispensing as many traps as possible to earn as many coins as possible as quickly as possible -- back and forth and back and forth. It's a sort of race, but not a particularly exciting one.", "date": "Oct 12, 2004"}
