That's where fishing videogames come into play. These games aren't really meant to replace the sport, merely give you your fix when you can't get out there. Bassmasters Classic is one of many portable versions of the sport on the Game Boy Color -- but it just isn't very good at all. Features Practice and Tournament modes Numerous lures Bassmasters license For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   Right when you open up the manual to the first page, you're faced with the bold statement: ~The best bass fishing game for the Game Boy Color...~ I sure as hell hope not. While fishing games isn't exactly everyone's forte, to have this game as the absolute highest watermark on the Game Boy Color wouldn't speak very well for the genre.  You really only have two modes of play in this game: Tournament and Practice. Obviously, Practice lets you hone your fish-seeking, and hooking skills before you enter the tournament. The tournament is a near-realtime competition to see if you can reel in the big ones in the given time. The competition lasts all day, so you have plenty of time to land the fish you need to qualify.  Let's say it right here and now: Bassmasters Classic is unbelievably dull. Casting the line is simply a matter of timing the gauge at one of five positions (the higher the mark, the further it goes). And when the lure's in the water, you cannot see if there are any fish in the vicinity of your hook. The only time you'll know you've got a fish near is when it actually lands on the hook: When a HUGE ~Strike!!~ screen pops up, it's all a matter of hitting down on the joypad to hook it. Then, you reel it in by holding down the A button. Release the button to ease the tension of the line. Once the fight is won, you head into a ~sub game~ of sorts to pull the fish in the boat. Time your hand at the bobbing fish, hit the button, and you've grabbed it. Miss three times and you lose the fish.  If you really have the patience to keep going, you are at least awarded a password that will let you continue into the tournament -- that is, if you qualify. The game does have plenty of lures and water conditions that supposedly affects the way the fish react to your fishing style, but you'd never know since you never see the fish react to your new bait.  I can't say I'm a fishing videogame nut, but I can appreciate the genre -- it's like the riverman's golf simulation. But this game just isn't good enough as a simulation for the sport, since it's just a fishing game with the mere basics of the sport. You can't even ~tease~ the fish...you simply wait until they hit your hook and you've landed them, and then repeat it all over again. Yawn.", "date": "Nov 13, 1999"}
