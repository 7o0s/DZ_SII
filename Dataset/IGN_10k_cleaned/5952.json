Now the mobile makers is following up with a 3D edition of the game that pretty much follows the same formula of the first -- same missions, same mini-games -- but inherits some of the problems that accompany the push into polygons.   Midtown Madness 3 follows the career tracks of two crazy drivers in Paris. The ambulance driver must careen around sharp turns and avoid dead-end alleys while picking up sick patients and take them to a nearby hospital where they are unceremoniously jettisoned from the back of the rig. The delivery career puts you behind the wheel of a Mini Cooper. As this driver, you must escort packages to specified drop-off points.   There are two additional play modes: Checkpoint and Blitz. Checkpoint is just what it sounds like -- a race against two other drivers through a series of checkpoints. The Blitz mode, which must be unlocked by playing through the career game, is another frantic city race against drivers through crowded streets. The career modes have four ~levels~ each, while the Checkpoint and Blitz modes have eight events each.   That's not a bad amount of content for a mobile game -- but honestly, some of the mechanics stretch it out longer than it has any right to be. Midtown Madness 3's controls can be a little on the frustrating side, and couple that with some rather unforgiving city planning, and there was more than a few occasions when I felt like hitting the ~END~ buttons and writing the game off.   Steering is done with the ~1,~ ~2,~ and ~3~ keys. ~2~ accelerates straight ahead while the flanking keys accelerate while turning. ~4~ and ~6~ turn the car left and right. ~5~ is the handbrake and ~8~ is a brake/reverse combo. These controls didn't feel as responsive on an LG VX8000 (test handset) as they did in the 2D version. Turning was sometimes under-sensitive, and in the event you ever crash into the side of a building, they're hard to use to get out of trouble. Time is wasted by only holding ~8~ to reverse course.   Because of the move to 3D, rather than the top-down 2D version, it's hard to get a real feel for the city without looking away from the action and at the small mini-map. Sometimes you can find yourself on a dead-end street and unable to get out before it's too late. The 3D itself isn't bad, but it's also underpowered compared to racers like Asphalt. Some of the polygonal scaling as objects get close to the camera is unappealing. Other cars don't become apparent until they're quite close to your vehicle.   A word about the sound in Midtown Madness 3: The engine noises are terrible. Seriously, if you download the game, make turning down the SFX volume your top priority. The menu music? Fine. But those engine revs sound like they were cribbed from an Atari 2600 game.   I'm having a hard time recommending Midtown Madness 3 -- at least, the 3D version. The top-down 2D racer played fine for what it was. But this 3D edition suffers from some of the problems with early mobile 3D -- odd polygonal scaling and touchy control. Controlling 3D with a thumbpad or a number pad is trying, to say the least. I appreciated the different vehicles and the way they handle differently (the ambulance and the Mini are totally different beasts that require different play styles). But ultimately, I got too frustrated with trying just to navigate the twists and turns to have much fun. If you're nuts about the franchise, stick with the 2D Midtown Madness 3.", "date": "Aug 23, 2005"}
