{"name": "Xevious 3D/G+", "name_review": "Xevious 3D/G+", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/06/12/xevious-3dg", "text": "If any classic game deserves to be brought into the polygon age, it's Namco's Xevious. Already ahead of its time when released, Xevious is the perfect contender for a face-lift. Thankfully, Namco has retained the gameplay elements that made the original so compelling.  The most outstanding aspect of Xevious 3D/G is its graphics. Normally PSXPower doesn't value graphics over gameplay, but this game just has to one of the most gorgeous titles we've ever seen. Built entirely out of polygons, Xevious 3D/G is Gouraud heaven, with only the slightest hint of textures. This gives the game a retro look that complements its style. The new techno soundtrack, which incorporates the original themes, adds immensely to the game as well.  Like the original, your ship shoots lasers and drops bombs, but the game has adopted the popular shooter convention of having three power-up types: laser, bullets, and plasma beam, which seeks out and destroys whatever it comes into contact with. All of the original Xevious enemies are       back, from the spinning rings and tanks       to the flipping mirrors. There's a whole       envoy of new ones as well, including Cylon-like       ships, deadly rainbow-emitting hawk ships,       and flying saucers.  The biggest problem with the Japanese version we received earlier this year was the amount of slow-down that occurred when the large bosses came on screen. Thankfully, most of this has been cleaned up, making for a smooth and fast game.  Listen: if you're a shooter fan, you must play this game. Add to this the inclusion of the       original Xevious (for those of you who       didn't get Namco Classics Volume 2),       Super Xevious, and Xevious Arrangement,       this package is well worth the admission price.", "date": "Jun 12, 1997"}
