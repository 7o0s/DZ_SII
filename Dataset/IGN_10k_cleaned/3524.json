No genre seems to have been untouched, including flight combat. From G-Lock and After Burner to the Aero series, in one way or another, Sega has been there and done that. Aero Elite Combat Academy is its latest effort in the flight category and it's a strange bird to be sure.   One would very well argue that the central focus in Aero Elite Combat Academy is its training missions. Few would dissent. It lives up to its title, Aero Elite Combat Academy in that regard: You train, make the academy, and move on. Only thing is that graduating to the other modes isn't that rewarding nor is there too much to do once you get there. Even when you dig into the Arcade mode, the game's second most substantial gameplay forum, it's filled with blas and unimaginative sorties. The two-player isn't terribly exciting either. It's essentially a game in which whoever sees the other guy first wins.   What Aero Elite Combat Academy seems to suffer from the most is a lack of inspiration, whether it's in the design, actual gameplay, or the delivery. Which translates into this: If you want a flight sim to pass the time, this will do in a pinch. If you're on the lookout for something dope, a flight combat game to keep and love, you may want to rent Aero Elite Combat Academy first, if at all.   Gameplay  On the big scale of arcade/simulation, Aero Elite Combat Academy heavily leans toward simulation. The training mode is your first indication: It's lined with missions to complete and requires that you pull them off with more than just some skill. It's very precise. And given the large list of aircraft (more than 60), you'll need to give most of them a try before blazing into any kind of battle. Following AeroWings, AeroWings 2: Air Strike and Aero Dancing on Dreamcast, this version seems to have gleaned the simulation aspects from the previous titles (not the trick aspects) to form this relatively cohesive whole, but what makes this one more interesting than its title, its modes, or other games in the series is its unlockable rewards. With 60 aircraft to fly, flight sim fans and airplane fanatics are going to have real fun.    But they'll have to play through the game first, which is where the ~stuff~ hits the fan. Given the five modes of play -- Arcade, Aero Meet 2002, Training, Free Flight, and Vs. Battle -- the game's main focus in the Training and Arcade modes. In Training, you're introduced to a handful of combat jets -- F-14, F-15, F-16, F/A-18, -- and then you're put through the ringer. The tests are very technical, given you read-outs on everything, from G-Force, height, latitude, pitch, yaw, etc., and you're meant to do exactly what the game requires you to do. Arcade fans almost assuredly and instantly will dislike this mode, but it's required for the game. To fly these guys you should really know what you're doing.   Yes, the game offers a decent pick-up-and-play feel, but it's also technically dependent, and what's more the gameplay itself is built around the enjoyment of technicalities, precise tactics, precision flying and the like. Personally, I don't enjoy this kind of flying. I prefer a little leeway, a little fudging, some slack when I make a quick, unrealistic turn, or try to perform a loop-de-loop. In the training mode of Aero Elite Combat Academy, little leeway is given, and in the Arcade mode, unless you select a fast, powerful craft, you're not likely to pull off any major daring or exciting moves.    Arcade mode fairs better, at first. You can skip the training and slam right into the first couple of sorties, and it's quite easy (you're given five levels of difficulty, Defcon 1-5), and after that the missions don't grow that much more difficult, but they're tremendously dull. There is little variety between missions, and the ones that break from the crowd most often end up being poorly designed. For instance, in one mission, players must down a bomber. It speeds ahead of you, and strangely, directly into the sun. You spend the first three-fourths of the mission flying directly into the glaring sun (realistic or not, it's not any fun) trying to catch up. It's nothing but speeding and reading meters. Then when you have caught up, taking out the bomber is easy; the two support ships are easy to knockout too. This is a rather typical mission.   A game of this sort would greatly benefit from diversifying its missions, easing up on the technical aspects a wee bit, and for the developers to create missions that are somewhat realistic, but at least entertaining. Even if the whole point is to be technically realistic, dog fights with the computer AI could easily stand to become more dynamic. The AI is predictable and unimaginative. But hey, you do unlock lots of stuff if you play through them.   Aero Meet 2002 and Vs. round up the various modes (Free Flight is exactly what it sounds like, which is also as boring as it sounds). Aero Meet pits you against AI in some tough competitions that can either be great fun for the masterful player or incredibly frustrating for the amateur or newbie. The Vs. mode is essentially a ~he-who-sees-the-other-first wins mode, with little variation in level design, few backgrounds to use to your advantage, and encouraging very basic strategies to win. It's more fun to play against a human, to be sure, but strangely, it's not that much fun here.    What good is Aero Elite Combat Academy, then? The controls are very sensitive and responsive, the level of technical details is better than average, and the crafts themselves are beautiful to view. If you want information on the crafts themselves, the Select Fighter menus provides lots of detail and background, providing a healthy level of education on the crafts' history, modifications over the years, and its current specialties. You will indeed get an abundance of crafts to fly too, including various international vehicles as well as harrier jets and helicopters. Again, both are intriguing to play at first, but technically designed to be flown just right. There is little leeway in their design, meaning that their pick-up-and-playability is limited.   Graphics  While flight sims usually offer great vistas and incredible views, it doesn't do one much good if there isn't anything with which to compare and contrast those big open skies. The biggest primary change to this generation of consoles is the increased level of detail developers can add to the landscape and to the airplane models themselves and Aero Elite Combat Academy offers a decent level of detail in these areas, but not much more. Sega's visuals are workmanlike at most.    The upside is that the aircrafts look great. The aircraft models are beautiful to observe, detailing fine triangular and sharp points with little to no aliasing, and portraying this ships with accuracy and care. Each and every vehicle is muscular, polished and sleek looking, and they can be observed with even finer detail in the ~observe~ function in the selection menus. With the exception of the cutscenes, in which the aircraft look excellent (and all decent flight sims do this well), nothing is terribly good looking nor flawed.    Compared to other games in this genre, (Ace Combat 5 comes to mind), the level of surface detail again falls into the ~average~ category. This isn't the finest scenery around, but it's good enough. Some of the details are good, such as skyscrapers, floating Sega blimps, and ancient unnamed Middle Eastern structures. But most of the time you'll be in air with few clouds or objects to place you in perspective, and it's just you and blue air. Is this a bad thing; is it unrealistic? No, but we are talking games here, and Sega's minimalist graphic effort is felt, even after a short period of time.   Sound  You'll hear straight-forward, humorless radio dispatches from HQ, either from a senior adviser or a female dispatcher, and all of it is accompanied by the perfectly formulated, entirely generic standard '80s heavy metal rock -- guitar solos included. If the movie Top Gun did anything for our culture it was to mix Kenny Loggins' hardest rock ever (which isn't saying much) and to marry guitar-heavy rock with fast flying. Once again, the audio is entirely average in its presentation and delivery.While I've played my fair share of flight combat games over the last eight years, there is nothing about Aero Elite Combat Academy that tickles my fancy or that I can particularly recommend. The emphasis on this game is, strangely, training, which seems to overshadow both the Arcade and Vs. modes, both of which aren't very compelling in their own right. if it's training you want, well here then. Take this.The visuals and audio are each, in their own rights, plain as paint, and the whole package seems to have been constructed to drift onto retail floors, sit around for a while and then fade quietly into history. I don't understand how Sega's AM2, with all its great development power, could generate such an underwhelming, uninspired game. But it's here, and while some gamers might really dig the technical aspects and rigorously realistic levels, overall, the game's lack of ~oomph,~ it's plain, repetitive missions, and average music and graphics should only compel you to rent this, if at all.", "date": "Mar 24, 2003"}
