{"name": "The Game of Life", "name_review": "Game of Life", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/01/08/game-of-life-2", "text": "Hasbro continues its ~family-oriented~ gaming trend with a conversion of another boardgame in the companies' existing line-up (its first was Monopoly). This time, The Game of Life gets the PlayStation treatment).  The premise of the game is made to humorously mimic life itself. Your gamepiece is a car, and you set out on a journey throughout a ~lifetime~  you earn a career with a set salary, get married, have kids, and retire, all in one game session. The person with the most money before retiring wins.  Throughout the game, you'll land on spaces that will give or take away from your earnings. Every time you land on a Pay Day space, you get money based on your set salary. You also can buy insurance that will save your butt if you land on ~car accident~ or ~house fire~ spaces.  The PlayStation game features a lot of little things that just aren't possible on the normal board game. Things like FMV as your car travels down the game's path, humorous cartoons at almost every square of the game, a commentator that runs a play-by-play of the game in progress, and more. Plus, you don't have to worry about keeping track of your funds  the game does that automatically. There's also a handful of mini-games that can earn players more money or exact revenge on other players.  It's not exactly Monopoly, but Game of Life is simplistic fun for those looking to kick back with a party game on the PlayStation.  This game is for people who just want to flip that off-button in their brains. There's really no thinking and very little strategy in this game  you can pretty much play the game without even looking at the screen.I remember getting my own Game of Life set when I was ten. It was big, elaborate, colorful, and nobody wanted to play it with me. And now I can see why --it really isn't that fun a game. Sure, it had a big spinning wheel that was so inviting to me, but did I really like playing this game over a decade and a half ago?The PlayStation version is a flat, stylized rendition of the board game that doesn't take advantage of the PlayStation hardware, other than the odd FMV animations that occur during key turns. And you know what? They're not that funny, either. The humor is like that of a stand-up comic without a clue  and it's almost just as embarrassing to hear all the ~funny comments~ from the game.The only real plus about the Game of Life is that it's a six player game, which makes it very ~party friendly.~ And unless you have five other humans to crawl around the screen, this isn't a game you want in your library.", "date": "Jan 8, 1999"}
