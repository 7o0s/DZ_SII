Not for gamers, of course, who should avoid this bad egg like salmonella, but for ourselves, because this review is going to be a breeze to write, and like the development studio that ported this ~effort,~ we're lazy. We could simply state that Chicken Shoot is a cash-in port of a shallow computer title that may as well have been a Flash-based game, and that it has gained absolutely nothing in the transition to Wii, but where is the fun in that? We've already pulled out a couple of bad puns, but ladies and gentlemen, we've got plenty more, and we intend to use them.  Chicken Shoot is very much like Duck Hunt. Not a next-generation remake of Duck Hunt, but the original, depth and graphics considered. Okay, so we're exaggerating just a little, but the truth of the matter is that this DSI Games-published game isn't any prettier or deeper than the shooting gallery in Wii Play, which was about as basic as they come. You point the Wii remote at the screen and shoot down a very small selection of chickens as they fly across the screen. Occasionally, there will be cluckers on the ground, or hiding behind objects, and sometimes they'll even throw eggs your way. You might even pick up a different gun or two, but that's really as far as it goes. A few minutes in, you'll start to wonder if there's anything more to the game and if you've managed to stay with the process for an hour, you'll very likely have completed the whole, copy-and-pasted affair. Nothing here is going to ruffle your feathers, one way or the other.  Not quite up to Rapala Pro Fishing's graphic standards.  The basic control mechanics are simplified to the point of boredom. You only point and shoot and except for a handful of different stages to do just that, there's not much to see. The title utilizes hand-drawn 2D graphics that, while not exactly ugly, are certainly dated, even for the less powerful Wii. The game features a very decent selection of locales to gun down ducks in, from the icy depths of Antarctica to the Nevada desert, where an extraterrestrial duck has crash landed. To give you an idea of just how shallow the game is and how often the same chickens and sound effects are re-used, the aforementioned alien chicken reappears in exactly the same spot after you have shot him dozens of times. Levels function as one big, tedious loop, respawning the same challenges over and over and over again until you start to wonder if there's even any point. We're still not sure that there is.  Chicken Shoot also features a two-player split-screen mode that you will not want to play. And to top everything off, there's a mini-game where you must catch eggs before they fall to the ground, and this particular offering looks, sounds and plays like it was developed by an actual chicken, perhaps in an attempt to maintain authenticity. There are not even any sound effects in this mode. It's all just mute. To call it horrible is flattering. For all the clucking about how Wii is perfect for light-gun-style games, Chicken Shoot just doesn't fly. It's got less meat than any McNugget and it doesn't even taste good  plus, it'll cost you about $30, which equates to about a dollar for every minute you'll spend with it. The core gameplay mechanics work, even if they are stupidly simple, but everything surrounding them will leave a bad taste in your mouth. Chickens will protest this game because it promotes their destruction. Humans will protest it because it sucks.", "date": "Jul 17, 2007"}
