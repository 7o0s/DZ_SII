As the second in the latest titles from Head Games that we reviewed today, Extreme Bullrider owes a lot to extreme rodeo, especially since half of the game is already included in the extreme rodeo package.   Extreme Bullrider covers two events: bull riding and bull fighting.  Bull riding was one of the events in extreme rodeo, so why the development team at Radish Works decided to make a totally separate title called Extreme Bullrider is a mystery to us (almost as big of a mystery as why that ~It's Like, You Know~ show is still on television, but that's another story).  Sure, there's the addition of bull fighting but, as you'll soon discover, this portion of the game belongs more in the home of the C.H.U.D.S. than it does on your local retailer's shelves.  The bull riding half of Extreme Bullrider plays just like it did in extreme rodeo. Wiggle your mouse until you fall off the bull or for a full eight second ride, whichever comes first.  Now if that's not your idea of fun then you must be, uh, sane.  There are eight different bulls to choose from overall, but they really don't differ from one another very much.  And even though you have an entire arena area to ride in, the bull will only stay within a few feet of the opening gate. Now I know that bulls don't run the entire length of the arena in a real rodeo, but this is just ridiculous.     If you can believe it, the bull fighting portion of Extreme Bullrider is even sadder than the bull riding competition. We've all seen pictures of the Spanish bull fighters.  It's a proud but brutal sport, usually ending with the death of the bull.  Well, bull fighting in this game isn't a grotesque display of machismo.  Instead, the best way to fight a bull in Extreme Bullrider is to pick up violins and colorful balls while avoiding cow pies and an asthmatic bull who's top speed seems to be about .25 miles an hour. What the hell?    As you can tell from this extremely short review, Extreme Bullrider has very little if any redeeming qualities and is simply not worth wasting time nor words on.  This game offers very little variety in gameplay and, considering I beat the high score on the hardest bull twenty minutes after installing it, there's hardly any need to take it out of the box.  If you're one of the unfortunate ones who has already bought this or has received it for a gift, I'm truly sorry.  This game is stinkier than a cow pie and about as fun as stepping in one.  -- Tal Blevins   If you want to read about some truly extreme sports, be sure to check out our IGN Extreme Games! feature.", "date": "May 5, 1999"}
