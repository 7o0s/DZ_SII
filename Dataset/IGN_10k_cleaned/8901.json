It's turn-based strategy game that requires lightning reflexes, smart planning, and creative problem-solving. It also stars a bunch of worms toting bazookas and holy hand grenades inspired by the best of Monty Python bits. There's a reason this game has such a devoted following, even as the series has taken a few unwise turns into 3D -- it's just crashing good fun.   It's also the seeming perfect fit for mobile. There's no relying on gussied up visuals; the entire game is cast in strict 2D. The turn-based combat requires no blistering chipset. Yet previous editions have not offered the full Worms experience. Controls were spotty, favorite weapons were inexplicably missing, and other issues kept the fanbase from truly embracing mobile versions. Worms 2007 works to correct those past mistakes, offering the best to-go edition of Worms yet on the smallest screen.   Haven't heard of Worms? You've been missing out then. Essentially, two teams of worms battle it out for supremacy over a rugged landscape, calling on both traditional and bizarro weapons to eradicate the opposition. Each team gets one turn of uninterrupted action to wreak havoc, cycling through worms that are randomly placed throughout the environment. Before your turn timer drops to zero, you must move, aim, and fire. It all sounds so basic until you see it in motion. A little worm squiggles across a crater, pulls out a shotgun, and blasts another worm square in the face. That worm then picks itself up, wriggles back over, and places some old-fashioned TNT right in front of it's assailant's mug.   It's much fun, especially against a good human opponent. Worms 2007 actually lets up to four players battle it out with pass-the-phone multiplayer. (Hopefully, a 2008 update will feature much-needed online. Crowding 'round a handset? No thanks.) Yet even alone, Worms 2007 offers some great play against some pretty bright AI. And should you ever want something other than a straight up brawl, you can also check out an array missions and deathmatch challenges.   Now, if you are a huge fan of the PC version or have been playing it on the DS or Xbox 360, the mobile version does require some modified expectations. The controls are entirely functional, but definitely require practice and patience. (Especially jumping and roping -- ugh, I blew so many plays before I got the hang of it.) The camera mode lets you scroll around the map, but the portrait-style screen of most mobiles still cuts off a lot of the playfield when you are making a move. If you can get around these two things, you'll find hours of fun in Worms 2007.Worms 2007 is the best version of the game on mobile thus far, so if you've been a bit bummed over past editions, this should make up for it. However, if you've never played Worms before, there's no better time to start.", "date": "Aug 15, 2007"}
