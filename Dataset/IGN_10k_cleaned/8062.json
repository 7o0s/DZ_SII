The same premiere racing game that launched alongside the ultra-powerful Xbox 360 in November 2005? Just to clarify, the racer developed by Bizarre Creations? All completely valid queries, as next-gen (now current gen) console games don't seem like the best inspirado for a platform that many developers cannot coax 16-bit performance from even in 2007. Yet this has not daunted Glu Mobile from giving it a shot, unleashing dual versions of the game -- 3D and 2D -- on the decks for your digital consumption.   Well, does it stack up?   Basing mobile games on existing console franchises is akin to walking a tricky tightrope -- the fan-base might not have proper expectations going into the space (as recently evidenced by the summary dismissal of mobile on a recent Game Scoop podcast... sigh). I'm not saying that expectations must be lowered to appreciate a mobile game, but they certainly must be adjusted before going into something like PGR Mobile fairly.   The difference between PGR2D and PGR3D are great enough that the game requires two separate reviews. The 3D game sports great visuals, but the driving is somewhat sluggish compared to the zippy, but occasionally ugly 2D edition.    The review that follows is for the 2D version of the game.   PGR Mobile attempts to recreate the kudos-driven game play of the Xbox series. You are granted access to a host of amazing licensed automobiles, such as a Lambo Gallardo, Aston Matrin Vanquish, and a Toyota GT-ONE, and sent around the world to exotic locations. Each location has different events for you to medal in, such as Street Race and Hot Lap.   You start out with only enough cash to buy one car from the lower tier of vehicles and access to only a few race events. To move up in the racing world, you must finish events under a specific set of requirements. For example: To win a Hot Lap, you have to beat a race time. But winning a race only earns you a certain amount of cash. To really fatten the purse, you must perform stylish driving maneuvers and earn kudos. Drifting, catching air, performing clean sections (not hitting anything), and drafting earn kudos.   The most kudos are awarded when you successfully drift around corners by pulling the hand brake (assigned to 1 and 3) and initiating a slide. If you're adept with drifting, you can rack up huge kudos in S-curves. Linking up maneuvers multiplies your kudos, too. If you perform an almost flawless race, you can exit with an easy 5,000 kudos. However, you can blow your kudos by striking a wall or another car, so you have to watch your fenders. Losing 1,000 kudos by bouncing off a rival racer can be quite disheartening.   Depending on which of the five difficulty levels you select when entering a race event -- PGR Mobile offers everything from easy to insane -- you earn different medals. The medals mirror the Xbox 360's Achievements. You can track your hardcore PGR Mobile skills via medal counts, just like a Xbox 360 player trying to earn all 1,000 points from the console game. Achievements are one of Microsoft's greatest ideas of this generation, and it was incredibly smart of Glu to replicate those as best as they could -- without infringement -- in the mobile game.   The biggest differences between the two versions, other than the visuals, are the amount of content and the smoothness of racing. The 2D edition has fewer race events and locations, which is something of a bummer. However, I felt more in control of the 2D edition -- which I tested on a Sony Ericsson w810i. Things never chug or slow down, no matter how many cars clog a corner. Steering also felt a little tighter. I was earning far more kudos in the 2D game due to what I felt were more responsive controls.   The graphics aren't as strong in the 2D game, as expected. The backdrops offer far less detail, the objects alongside the roads are blocky, and the other cars are very non-descript.  The 2D edition of Project Gotham Racing Mobile is a solid mobile racer with good controls and a nice variety of race events. The game does what it can to approximate the Xbox 360 version of the game, such as adding Achievements via a medal system and decently recreating the kudos system of risk reward. It's not a wild step above the existing 2D racing fare, but it's a strong entry in the genre and I think mobile racing fans will have a great -- but not awesome -- time playing it.", "date": "Feb 16, 2007"}
