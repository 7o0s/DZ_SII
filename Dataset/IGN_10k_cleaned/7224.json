{"name": "LMA Manager 2007", "name_review": "LMA Manager 2007", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/09/12/lma-manager-2007", "text": "The fickle world of football management is no place for the faint of heart, the thin of skin or anybody who doesn't derive a perverse pleasure from pawing over screen after screen of stats and ratings bars. For many, the appeal of footy manager games is as unfathomable as the surrealist musings of a certain Monsieur Cantona, but get properly stuck in and they can consume your life. For years Championship Manager was the yardstick against which all others fell short and a change of name (Football Manager) and publisher hasn't dented the success of the series or the fanatical devotion of its followers.    Sensibly, LMA doesn't aim to go up against Football Manager on its own terms. Instead Codies has ramped up the frills to present an apparently more accessible but vastly less involving experience. Accessibility however is very much in the eye, or rather the mouse of the beholder, and despite the fact there's far less to see and do than in its main rival, moving around the game is clunky and rarely intuitive.   The main screen features two identical modes of navigation. Down the left, simple text links access drop down menus leading to different areas of the game - finance, transfer market, squad details and so forth. At the bottom are exactly the same menus in icon form. Is this a good idea? Well, no it isn't. Who's going to go to the trouble of learning what the icons mean when you can just read?  Repetition aside it works adequately enough and, with a bit of practice, you can skip around the essential screens with ease. However, it's not always immediately obvious where you might find a specific piece of info. For example, if you want to know your average attendance for the season, you'll neither find it under Information nor Records, but in the Finance section. Odd.    A process of trial and error will eventually enable you to find whatever it is you need but there are two further significant interface irritations. Firstly, all important information from the game world is relayed to you via an email system. These notifications cover most aspects of your club - injuries, suspensions, transfer enquiries, moans from players, that sort of thing. If the email refers to something that needs to be actioned, a button appears taking you straight to the relevant screen. However, you can't click directly on any team or player names mentioned in the text of the mail which is simply annoying. Another peeve is the lack of a 'back' button meaning you constantly have to refer back to the main navigation. This might sound like a small point, but in a game where you're constantly bouncing between different screens it's a persistent nark.   Player information is nicely presented with pulldown menus quickly enabling you to view an individual's abilities, contract details, injuries and general demeanour quickly and easily. This is displayed to the right of the screen while your squad list appears on the left enabling quick and easy comparison.   Tactically, there's loads of stuff to fiddle with. You can go with a standard default four-four-two or choose from a selection of systems as employed by successful teams of the past. Should you wish, you can get your Hartlepool side playing the beautiful football of Brazil's 1970 World Cup winners or Cruyff's Barca of the early 90s. If that sounds a bit too la-de-da, why not try the long ball game of Jack Charlton's Ireland or the hit-and-hope of Wimbledon in the 80s? You can even try out that Christmas tree nonsense with which Glenn Hoddle totally failed to win the 1998 World Cup, although most of us would rather just forget about the whole thing.   If none of these appeal (there are plenty more to choose from), you can generate your own, positioning players and using slider bars to determine defensive line, balance between long balls and short passing, how wide or narrow the team will play, attacking bias either left, right, both wings or down the middle. You can ponce about with such details to your heart's content, then go out and raid the transfer market for players to fit your system.    All well and jolly until you realise that none of it really makes a jot of difference. If LMA is to be believed, there is quite literally nothing to football management. Leaving all tactical and formation options on the default settings and only swapping players out of the starting line-up when injured or suspended, yours truly was able to cruise to the Championship title in the first season with a 115 goals, 107 points and a goal difference of +83. Such unlikely stats go down in no small part to five 7-0 victories over the course of the season and two centre forwards finishing on 47 and 43 goals respectively. It soon becomes clear that the only thing you really need to worry about is signing the best available players in each position and a Premiership title will inevitably be yours within the space of a few seasons without ever even looking at the tactics screen.Its this fundamental lack of involvement on a person level and painfully unrealistic performance statistics that seal LMAs fate. Youll have a little fun with it at first and it makes a lot of the right noises. Attention to detail in all the featured grounds - right down to Conference level - is a nice touch and the ability to design and develop your own stadium from literally hundreds of combinations is pleasingly diverting. Theres also a very nice looking, if ultimately superfluous, 3D match engine which youll soon tire of and find yourself skipping to get straight to the results. Unfortunately, the lack of any emotional contact with your players and a lightweight feel prevents it from ever getting under your skin. Its not a bad game and, despite some interface flaws, it doesnt do anything cataclysmically wrong. If youre looking for something less all-consuming than Football Manager then give it a whirl. If youre serious about footy management however, theres only one choice to make, and this isnt it.", "date": "Sep 12, 2006"}
