Four brave warriors rise to the challenge, and set off on a mission of rescue together. All of the requisite fantasy-theme elements are set up and in place for King's Knight, but it all falls apart after you press Start -- because this game isn't an RPG, it's a shooter.   It's a forced-scrolling shooter that simply swaps spaceships and aliens for wizards and goblins, and it's utterly unimpressive in almost every area of design. King's Knight is a Square game, one of the company's early ones from the NES era, but it has almost none of the fun factor and lasting appeal of Square's other efforts from that age, like Final Fantasy. It offers, instead, a bland and basic vertically-scrolling blaster design that's built on a gimmick of scenery destruction and power-up collection, with a brief undercurrent of teamwork between its four heroes.   All of those are power-ups. None of them really do anything. Those heroes are Ray Jack the Knight, Kaliva the Wizard, Barusa the Monster and Toby the Kid Thief, each of whom you control individually and each of whom begins the game with limited mobility and firepower. You start off in King's Knight in a fantasy environment like a forest or medieval castle town, and the scenery constantly scrolls downward at you. If you find yourself too cramped and contained by the walls of trees, bushes and bricks scrolling toward you, you can attack them with forward-flying fireballs to destroy them and clear away a new path. Destroying the environment in this way reveals hidden power-ups in the form of collectible arrows, triangles, circles and more, each of which upgrades your current character's speed, health or jumping power.   But destroying the environment in that way also reveals hidden enemies, who will immediately rush straight at you, often faster than you can avoid their attack. It happens a lot in King's Knight, and it makes playing through even a single level brutally tough. The combination of in-the-open enemies hurling projectiles at you, the hidden foes that lunge from the shadows of destroyed trees and, worst of all, health-draining ~power-ups~ shaped like downward-pointing arrows make each stage terribly difficult to traverse.   What's more, your characters' abilities don't seem to increase fast enough to counterbalance the relative ramp-up in each level's enemy assault. Shooter classics like Gradius and R-Type let you go from the slowest, most basic version of your starship to a fully upgraded, capable war machine pretty quickly -- here in King's Knight, the progression is much, much slower and you'll likely already be dead by the time you would've been able to really start dishing out some significant damage. There are special invincibility-granting magic spells that you can earn with extreme dedication and luck, but even these are only briefly featured and not much help since they can only be used in the game's final level.   Speaking of which, the game's final level is where the brief undercurrent of teamwork between King's Knight's four heroes finally shows up, as it features simultaneous control of all four warriors. The four characters advance through the stage in a diamond-shaped formation, with collectible position-swap power-ups littered around everywhere in case you want to change who's taking the lead in the front -- it's an interesting gameplay idea, and one that could have made King's Knight more unique and approachable overall; If it wasn't just used in the game's last level, that is, since few players of the too-difficult first four stages will ever live to see the mechanic in action.King's Knight is a poor substitute for the old-school role-playing experiences that made Square famous back in the day, so don't even worry about spending your time on it; you have better things to do, believe it.", "date": "Mar 26, 2008"}
