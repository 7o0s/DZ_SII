{"name": "Pro Race Driver", "name_review": "Pro Race Driver", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/12/10/pro-race-driver", "text": "With little to no fanfare and following the swollen monsoon that was the late November push, Codemasters delivers one of its two seminal racing games, Pro Race Driver, to the unknowing masses (the other being Colin McRae Rally 3.0, due this spring). Interestingly enough, Pro Race Driver follows up yet another obscure but nonetheless great racing game, Jarrett and LaBonte Stock Car Racing, which in turn was formed from the popular European racer Toca Racing.    In other words, this is TOCA 4, a highly refined blend of simulation and arcade driving definitely leaning toward sim racing. It's also a little bit of an RPG in that it tells a story that changes depending on your performance, with a host of characters and a beginning, middle and end. Pro Race Driver chronicles the career of Ryan McKane, the young heir to a family of great racers but who wants to make it on his own.    Cobbling together an excellent set of racing aspects from perfectly weighted cars to an excellent physics system to a great sense of speed, Pro Race Driver also has a mind to offer razor-sharp AI and a next-generation deformation system, taking the best aspects of its former titles and refining them even further. And Codemasters has had the mind to fix the framerate issues that dogged the European version, creating a better sense of speed, fluidity and conrol. In essence, it's the next progression in the excellent TOCA series and a superb racing game.   Gameplay  Like they said in The Bad News Bears 2, to assume is to make an ass out of u and me, so then I won't make the assumption you have ever played either Jarrett and LaBonte Stock Car Racing or TOCA Racing. Because, honestly, unless you were a rabid racing fan or a European gamer, you would have missed it. Pro Race Driver follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, upping the ante in every aspect, from smoother, faster racing to better looking graphics to an exquisite set of engine sounds and more.    Using an interface that seems to be more than just a passing fad, Pro Race Driver puts players in the role of young Ryan McKane, an up-and-coming driver who wants to make it big on his own, and he sets up in an office, which is in fact the menu itself. By using the directional pad to scroll left or right, players see McKane sitting at his desk in front of a computer, able to scroll through his email to accept standard tour challenges, hot-headed one-off races (in which the winner takes the loser's car), or to select from a host of other choices. The computer leads to the career mode, but from the desk, McKane can go to Options, check the racing world map, or enter into Free Time mode, which includes TV and Video coverage, Multiplayer challenges (time race or a custom championship), a Free Race (a full championship or a custom race on any track), or Time Trial. It's your basic set up but it's dramatically delivered with realistic ornaments to put players deep into the role.   What's interesting about Pro Race Driver is the attempt to add ~RPG~ wrinkles. From the very first video of the game, players see Ryan McKane's father racing back in the day. He takes first place after the first lap, but he's blind-sided by the racer behind him and his car flips onto the grass, ultimately setting on fire and killing him. Both Ryan and his brother watch in horror as their father dies. The camera slowly zooms into Ryan's eye, re-appearing in a race modern day times. Ryan's brother recommends a searching team manager to Ryan and from there you follow through cutscenes Ryan's career, which sets up the whole ambitious racer kernel from the get-go.   The cutscenes appear before and after most races, and occasionally if you have pummeled a particular racer hard, you'll get a yelling at in a special cutscene, adding a little tension and consequence to your actions. These scenes add story to an otherwise dry set racing game and give something to adhere to. It works pretty well, especially since the conversations are often direct, witty and even sometimes harsh. For instance, Ryan tries to pick up on a flag girl who brushes him off while on old racer from Ryan's father's generation, Cannonball So and So (sorry forgot his full name,) laughs at Ryan's poor tactics. In other scenes you hear comments from Ryan's brother (through the press) and you find yourself being singled out by particularly bitter rivals who challenge and occasionally pick on you. The point being this: You do get a feeling for the character and what it's like to be a pro race driver, even if it's in a funny kind of fictional way.    Another aspect lending itself to RPG-like gameplay is the non-linear style of progression. Unlike V-Rally 3, in which you must stick with a sponsor for an entire season, in Pro Race Driver you can race through a challenge (eight or so courses) and pick up a good-sized sponsorship and bonus (with cash incentives), but then switch to an entirely new sponsor aftr you've completed those courses. That, and the course progression is entirely up to your every whim. The Career mode is set up with tiers -- second, first, and super cars. You start in the second tier with a choice of about eight races, some of which can instantly be joined, while other require a time test. Players accumulate points for ranking highest, but they also pick up points (though very few) for scoring lower, such as fourth place, so as you progress you're earning points to move into the next tier. Also, the challenges vary. Some are single day events, while others are longer sponsorships.    Creating a kind of unique spontaneity is the occasional challenge from a racer who wants to test your mettle head to head. These are single-lap pink slip races that take place all over the world, pitting you in very cool cars indeed. You race in burly muscle machines such as a Dodge Charger, Corvette and oddball guys like Minis and whatnot. What's nice about these races is that you can restart if you suck it up (unlike in the challenges). It's nice because the cars all drive with wildly different styles. The American muscle cars lack handling and slide all over the road. You need a few tries to master them.   In general, Pro Race Driver offers a very respectable smattering of goodies that car fans should love. It's packed with real-life races, teams and courses.  There are 42 licensed touring & race cars including Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon, Mercedes CLK, Alfa Romeo GTV and Viper GTS, to name a few, but there are also 38 international circuits, 13 global championships such as official series DTM from Germany, V8 Supercars from Australia and the British Touring Car Championship. The car list includes an excellent roster of games. They include: V8 Supercars: Ford Falcon, Holden Commodore  DTM: ABT Audi TT-R, Mercedes Benz CLK-DTM, Opel Astra V8 Coupe  BTCC: Alfa Romeo 147, Lexus IS200, MG ZS, Peugeot 406 Coupe, Vauxhall Astra Coupe  Alfa GT Cup: Alfa Romeo GTV  Pacific Challenge: Mitsubishi Mirage, Subaru Impreza WRX, Toyota Chaser 2.0  Americas Series: Chevrolet Cavalier Z24, Dodge Neon Highline GT-R, Damier Chrysler Eagle Talon  European Cup: Toyota Supra, Lotus Elite, Chevrolet Corvette ZO6  Northern European Challenge: Proton Satria Gti, DPRS T-230, Subaru Impreza WRX  American All-Stars: Chevrolet Monte Carlo  LOLA World Championship: Marcos Mantis GT3, TVR Tuscan Challenge, AC Cobra 212 S-C. Dodge Viper GTS-R, Nissan Skyline GT-R R34  Elite Championship-B: Dodge Charger, Mini-Cooper S, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI GSR, AC Cobra Mk-4 CRS, Chevrolet Corvette - 1978, TVR Tuscan R   Codemasters has done several things to upgrade the quality of its driving that bear out extremely well in the racing department. There are few games with better AI or car damage models and Pro Race Driver fleshes both out with extreme finesse. The AI cars all seem to follow different splines and react to you -- and each other -- differently. Sometimes huge pileups create an opportunity to blast through and take first place, while other times a few leaders will break out and smoke the competition. But -- and this is a big but -- you can do something about it. If you drive well, take turns smartly and learn the lines to follow, you can catch up and out-drive the competition, sometimes even from lowly eighth place.   Also, AI drivers appear to remember your haphazard driving tactics -- whether they're accidental or purposeful. Unlike the predictable AI in GT3, these drivers return the favor, slicing you off the course, of bumping you into the grass at opportune moments. So, you really must learn to drive the course, but also you need to know how to handle the particular car and more importantly know who your competitors are. With four perspectives (cockpit, cockpit with hood, first-person and over-the-shoulder), players get an arrow that darkens as the nearest AI comes closer indicating their promiximity. Learning the many intricacies of the AI is actually an excellent psychological sub-game in its own, and as the game progresses it gets even harder and more competitive.    On that same topic, learning to drive the cars is extremely pleasurable; it's surely the best aspect of Codemasters' racer. It's crystal clear that right alongside Polyphony Digital, Codemasters is a master (yes, bad pun intended) of car physics, whether its in Pro Race Driver or the upcoming Colin McRae Rally 3. These cars feel weighty yet manageable, heavy and powerful but responsive and quick, capable of incredible speeds yet instantly reactive to your controls. They offer a special sense of control very few racing games offer.    While each of the cars is different, you're given a rich sense of control. For instance, before hitting a hairpin turn, you have to tap the brakes to slow down from a high-speed stretch. Punching the brakes will simply crash you into a wall. Grass and gravel each have their own unique characteristics and affect your speed, handling and acceleration. Cars can tip onto two wheels, or they can flip over entirely. Complete spinouts happen if you're not careful. Pulling out of an e-brake slide varies depending on your speed, the turn and your skill. If managed well, it works well, if not, well, it doesn't and you're deep into the dirt. The point is, these cars handle with extreme precision and accuracy and if you build up your skills you can become an extremely deadly opponent on the race course. And, the cars deliver an incredible sense of speed, even in the over-the-shoulder perspective. You'll definitely get that rush of adrenaline you're looking for.   Lastly, the car damage model is better than in just about any other game around, which once again helps to differentiate this from other sims on PS2, such as Gran Turismo 3 A-spec and Ferrari F-355. In this game you car degrades from all areas, starting with outer sections, such as the bumpers and mufflers, and then moves inward toward the drive shaft, wheels, brakes, etc. You could end up driving a skeleton of a car, without a hood, trunk, fenders, bumpers, windows, grill, and more by the end of any race and yet still finish. And of course, car damage affects the car's performance, an incentive to stay lean, mean and more importantly, unscathed.    Graphics  As one of the better racers on PS2, Pro Race Driver delivers an assortment of excellent graphic touches, solid backgrounds and well-implemented special effects that put this game in the elite list of good looking racers. The backgrounds are beautifully detailed with several layers. The close up track shows off everything from decent looking crowds to detailed grass, trees and dirt -- which issues up dust and particles when you skid in it.  Beyond the track, there are several folds of trees, buildings and detail, much of which is purposely blurred while far away and that comes into finer detail when up close. There is a bit of aliasing, which seems to show up sometimes more than others, but it's never bad enough to get whiny about. It's there, but it doesn't interfere or distract from the game's otherwise good looks.    The particle effects are excellent. They're best viewed when cars crash into each other, but can be seen just as easily when your car starts to collapse, such as when mufflers and bumpers drag, or when you scrape against a rail or barrier. Following in numerous racers' footsteps, Pro Race Driver delivers superb lighting, which is used in various ways, be it during a soft-lit sunset or a bright shiny days where the sun totally blinds you. Rays of sunlight pierce healthy, colorful trees, they brighten the day casting decent looking shadows, but nonetheless create a sense of lighting depth and dimension. The skies are even artfully drawn, with gorgeous cloud formations and sun-soaked streams of light punching through them.   In fact, every visual aspect of Pro Race Driver is handled professionally and artistically, giving players the sense that Codemasters can handle the PS2's myriad of processors and RAM issues from a technological standpoint, but that it also has artistic vision. On that latter point, the interface is handled with organized precision and a large, spacious feel, while the cutscenes, filled with moving, talking and interacting people, are impressive from a detail standpoint. Characters move their bodies and heads well, blink and move their eyes with relatively good timing and human rhythm, as opposed to crazy Madden NFL 2001 eyes and rag doll Grand Theft Auto bodies. It's just one beautiful game.   Sound  Not that I heard that much music, but the few songs I did hear were amusing and enjoyable. One song in particular is Lynyrd Skynyrd's Sweet Home Alabama. And it's not blaring out from the front of the speakers, either. It's casually running on a little radio that sits in the menu room where you choose the game modes you'd like to select. It's almost incidental, but it's the real song and it's cool. I mean, hey! Who can deny Sweet Home Alabama, even if it's a little old-fashioned redneck rock?   Surely even more impressive, however, are the car sounds. Once again, the level of detail is handled with exquisite care. Most cars show off several levels of sound, and in the ones with turbo you'll hear the gear box shifting higher but in the background you'll hear the turbo whizzing and clicking, too. The sounds all appear to have been recorded from real cars and engines, so the end result delivers a sense of power and immersion. Other little details are just as convincing. Use the ebrake to take a sharp turn and listen as you skid out, and then as your wheels try to regain traction. They skip, skid and burn, finally digging in. Or when you crash! Wow, now those are some impressive sounds. You hear metal bending, glass shattering, and a storm of other sounds to boot. Race Pro Driver is a sim game to be sure, with some arcade leanings that provide some forgiveness and a good learning curve. It definitely goes up against GT3, and in most ways it wildly succeeds. There is no doubt that when it comes to exquisite looking car models, or deep collision and physics systems, Pro Race Driver provides an undeniably excellent racing experience. Perhaps the story is a bit cornball from time to time and you may not even want to experience it, but I felt that Codemasters' attempts at creating a textural racing experience was, in most parts, a success. It created an easy to swallow backstory for the racing experience and it put things in a perspective that may indeed gather some folks around to talk about. At the very least, it's entertaining and fun to watch. In the end, there is little to complain about. Codemasters game is excellent. It drives incredibly well, looks excellent, offers a high-end and functional interface, and it finally comes together to offer gamers a blisteringly fast, high-end driving experience that really is in a class of its own.", "date": "Dec 10, 2002"}
