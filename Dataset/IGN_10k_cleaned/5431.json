After spending a few days digging around in the game (and actually reading the box), I see that it has quite a bit more to offer. It doesn't revolutionize the game and it's gameplay additions are virtually negligible but Altarian Prophecy does represent a pretty impressive content boost for the popular 4X game.  For quite a few gamers out there, Stardock's Galactic Civilizations represents the pinnacle of sci-fi 4x gaming. They'll be happy to hear that this expansion plays exactly the same as the original game. It's still got the same witty tone, it still has the same 90s graphics and it still has the same compelling galaxy-conquering mechanic.  Those of you who remember the first game (and who ought to be the only ones interested in the review of the expansion pack) know that the Altarian civilization bore a confusing resemblance to the Humans. The new nine-mission campaign in the expansion reveals more of the Altarians background and finally gives us some answers. Along the way you'll come into conflict with two new races who each have a part to play in unraveling the mystery of the Altarian Prophecy. Unfortunately they're none too cooperative so you'll often find yourself beating the truth out of them, sci-fi style.  Though the missions reward military conquest, there are some interesting alternate objectives to achieve as well. Some missions require you to form alliances with other races, or to culturally assimilate them. The challenge level builds throughout the campaign as you take on each new enemy in turn. I like that some smaller, easier scenarios are stuck in the middle of the game. It gives the whole experience a nice pace.  The four new ships don't upset the balance of power too terribly much but they do offer some interesting benefits that will definitely find application in your games. The good civs can benefit from the Paladin, a tough capital ship that heals other ships in the same sector. The evil civs can use the Vamp. Though it's not a top-of-the-line ship, its ability to steal shield energy from its opponents makes it deadly in combat. The other two ships affect the defensive rating of ships in the same sector, the Sovereign increasing the defense of all friendly ships and the Wraith subtracting from the defense of all enemy ships. Like I said, the new ships won't replace the Defenders and Battleships that you probably normally rely on, but they do a good job of supplement the fleets.   There are a few extra conveniences thrown in here that were missing in the original game. For one thing, you can now set up rally points for your fleets. This isn't as useful in the smaller scenarios, but once you switch to the larger galaxies, you'll find it invaluable in getting your fleets together with as few headaches as possible. The diplomacy screens are improved as well. The new foreign policy screen gives you access to all seven civilizations at once, rather than forcing you to back in and out to get the ones you want. The United Planets screen is a lot clearer now as well.  The fun doesn't end once you've completed the campaign either. The game expands the Metaverse options quite a bit with the addition of 10 new scenarios. (For those who don't know, the Metaverse is the more open-ended, dynamic campaign.) The different scenarios tend to focus on certain alliances or accelerate the acquisition of technology. Heck, one scenario even does away with technology altogether, requiring you to beat your enemies on a more level field. Most interesting, I think, is the Acceleration mode that ramps up the rate of growth in a variety of areas.  And if that's not even enough for you, there's a brand new scenario editor that lets you set up whatever conflict you want, complete with galaxy layout as well as the starting strength and alliances of each and every civilization in the game. Those individual missions can be linked together to form larger campaigns and can be freely traded on the game's website. Sadly, no documentation was included in my review pack, so I was only able to tinker with the tools without getting a sense of their full potential. For twenty bucks, this is a great deal for fans of Galactic Civilizations. It doesn't really add much to the game mechanic, but the added content definitely extends the live of the original and makes a nice way to pass the time until Galactic Civilizations II is released. When you add in the ability to design your own scenarios and campaigns, there's a ton of replay value here.", "date": "Jan 12, 2005"}
