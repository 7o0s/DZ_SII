This is a comforting verity many gamers have grown to depend on over the years. Why is this, exactly? In a nutshell, the design team has more time to include features left out of the original due to time or money restraints, negative and positive feedback has been gathered from vocal players and game critics and generally speaking, sequels often carry more of a sense of polish as the bugs have been cast out of its predecessor.   With that in mind, NovaLogic's Delta Force was a highly-enjoyable -- and for the most part, underrated  -- action/strategy hybrid when it was released last year, but the sequel does very little to push the franchise, or genre, much further. Here's the skinny...  For the uninitiated, players in the Delta Force universe serve as a highly-skilled member of an elite multinational anti-terrorist unit. In this sequel, you've been appointed to complete roughly twenty-stand alone missions, each varying in situation, terrain and weather effects. If you really have some brass in your pants, gamers can indulge in one of two distinct campaigns, each with about a dozen-or-so stringed missions tied together by an evolving storyline. Alternatively, for a real challenge, gamers can log online and engage in tactical warfare with and against human opponents. Much of the gameplay revolves choosing the right arsenal for the job, then sneaking through vast outdoor  and some indoor  environments with your magnified sniper mode on (and in some cases, with the help of an allied support team), and performing varied commando-esque objectives along the way: infiltrate a base, rescue a hostage, blow up enemy weapon depots, and so forth. As with the original Delta Force, it's certainly fun to turn off the lights and crank up the speakers for an immersive experience, but unlike similar games such as Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear or Spec Ops: Rangers Lead the Way, the lukewarm graphics in Delta Force II really dampen the sense of believability.  Back again is NovaLogic's trademarked voxel engine, which works for the most part in flight simulations such as Comanche 3, but the problem with Delta Force II is the player is always knee-deep in the environment at ground level, such as in high grass, snow-capped mountains or swampy lowlands. The terrain is quite grainy and large objects look blocky, but there is support for 3D accelerator graphic cards this time around to smooth out the character textures and add some softening to the trees and buildings. Just for fun, I booted up the original Delta Force and there isn't any noticeable difference. Also, the Delta Force II resolution is fixed at 640 x 480 in hardware mode, that is, until I found out a patch was needed to achieve the 1024 x 768 resolution as promised in the manual. Other graphical glitches include clipping problems, and getting stuck while trying to creep indoors. It should be noted that frame rates seemed even choppier than in Delta Force, so take the minimum specs seriously and be sure to have a faster system than the recommended Pentium 200 with 64MB of RAM.   In light of gameplay, missions are slightly larger and more difficult than in Delta Force, but in a game aiming for realism (i.e. you die once riddled with a couple bullets), it's frustrating you cannot save mid-mission. OK, so the ol' saving-and-loading shuffle isn't that realistic either, but if you spend twenty minutes crawling through some grasslands, pegging off a couple dozen bad-ass terrorists single-handedly, you're not going to be pleased if you have to repeat the mission from the very start until you get it right. Why not provide the gamer with the option?  Weapons are standard fare for these types of military stealth games, but with some noticeable exceptions  cool gadgets such as the XME177 (M4) with a grenade launcher and Barrett M82A1 .50 Rifle are two personal faves.  The enemy artificial intelligence (and in many cases, your allied A.I.) is a mixed bag at best. In some cases, they acted somewhat cleverly by hiding behind vehicles or running away from a potentially hazardous scenario, but in other cases, a quick peek through your sniper lens and characters seem stuck  in motion or just stand there even if gunshots kill their comrades not three feet away! Your teammates are equally as unpredictable  if you stick according to plan, they may prove handy, but if you vary from the pre-determined waypoints, you're on your own, brother. Don't expect them to come a knockin'.  If solo gameplay ain't your bag, or if you're frustrated at the inconstancies in character behavior, NovaWorld is one of Delta Force II's few saving graces. This free multiplayer network supports dozens of players in the same arena to play over the Internet and adds much more white-knuckle combat and intensity than the single-player missions by sneaking your way through long grass alongside real, human teammates in a gripping game of say, King of the Hill. Unfortunately, some of the promised gameplay modes and extra features for NovaWorld players have not yet been implemented at the time of writing this. This includes new game modes, such as Team Flag Ball, Attack and Defend and Search and Destroy options.   In short, Delta Force II is not worse than the original game, but it certainly does not add much at all to the franchise. Perhaps with better graphics, additional features and more polish, it could have been. Fans of the original game may get more of what they liked out of this sequel, but be sure to download the patch to repair some annoying quibbles, and above all else, play online for free at NovaWorld to get the most out of the game.  -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Nov 24, 1999"}
