All signs indicate that you're in for an intense, engaging experience. But you're not. The flash, flair and immediate impact of this title's opening moments give way, instead, to a ponderous, repetitive gameplay experience that's ultimately only a few steps superior to the Turbo's other first-person dungeon crawler, Double Dungeons. Like a sprinter competing in a marathon, Silent Debuggers runs out of steam after only the first few minutes.   Leon is your partner's name, and Leon explains to you the plan  there's an old, abandoned space station drifting along out there in orbit, and it's said to be holding an unimaginable treasure somewhere inside. The only problem with going to get said riches is that the station is also infested with aliens  legless, floating, freakish intruders stalk the halls and corridors and every other person to have ever tried to head inside has not come back outside alive.   Leon's not scared, as he drags you, a rookie ~debugger~ along and docks inside the station. It's up to you to clear out the structure, level by level, finding and killing every alien on every floor and ultimately tracking down the hidden treasure. An added complication? The station's set to self-destruct. Silent Debuggers plays out in real time, and you've only got so many minutes to make it through the entire dungeon-crawling quest.   The space station isn't a dungeon, of course, but it's really the same feel  the first-person perspective and restricted, jagged, cardinal-direction-only exploration through countless look-alike corridors makes Silent Debuggers feel just like the early Dungeons & Dragons titles, with a splash of sci-fi paint thrown on to try to mask the fact. The difference comes in Debugger's interaction with the enemies and environments, which are more dynamic than the simple hack-and-slash-an-unmoving-foe standard employed by similar games  this title has guns, after all.   Six different guns, all told, and you can carry two of them at a time. When you've scoured the halls to locate the nearest enemy, an alert will sound (your HUD is something of an early version of Samus' Metroid Prime visor) and you'll blast away with your automatic rifle, your grenade launcher or your sonic pulse generator. The experience of fighting the alien intruders in this way can be exciting, and it's interesting to see how the first-person shooter genre was taking shape back in 1991 on the 16-bit TurboGrafx system. The problem, then, is in the repetitiveness of it all.   You walk around the halls, then blast a bad guy. Then you walk around the halls, then you blast a bad guy. Silent Debuggers is just a shallow experience, and there never seems to be anything more to it that what you get right up front. It's lather, rinse and repeat all the way through to the end  if you find yourself motivated enough to play that far, or motivated enough to keep dealing with that snide, lazy Leon. Oh, I'm going to go fight and risk my life while you stay behind safely in the control room? Thanks, Leon. That's some great partner you are.  If safe to stay quite far away from Silent Debuggers' slow gameplay. First-person shooters just weren't viable yet in 1991, and though it's admirable what the Turbo achieved in this title 16 years ago, it's just not an experience that holds up against, really, any other FPS. Don't bother crawling through these sci-fi dungeons  your 600 Points are better invested elsewhere.", "date": "Jul 21, 2007"}
