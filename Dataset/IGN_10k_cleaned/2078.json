Acclaim's super-fast cyber-racer is loaded with sleek style, smooth graphics, and speed, speed, speed.   With XG3, all of the right elements have aligned like moving stars to make it undeniably fun to play. Gone are the magnetically annoying bikes from the frame-flopping Nintendo 64 version. Gone are the random pick-ups littering the course-ways. Swept away are the ridiculously lame designed tracks. And finally, thanks to the coders at Cheltenham Studio and the polygon-pushing horse that the PS2 is, the game moves at 60 frames per second, relaying an incredible sense of speed and control. What these guys have done is to realize their vision in full, and it's quite an affair.    Gameplay If you're a ridiculously loyal PlayStation and PlayStation 2 owner like myself, then you'll inevitably be asking this question: ~Is it better than Wipeout Fusion?~ Or... ~Should I buy this or Wipeout Fusion?~ Even if you aren't staunchly loyal to the former Psygnosis team, it's a good question, with one fault. Wipeout Fusion isn't out. It's not officially even been announced in the US. Also, there's a good chance it may not even come out this year. So, there's nothing quantifiable to compare XG3 to.   Even more to the point is this, even though XG3 has unapologetically nicked the Wipeout formula -- fast, futuristic racing powered by sleek iconographic design and pounding techno music -- the game stands on its own, providing an undeniably complete racing package that has become, in its own way, unique, exhilarating, and worth every penny you pay for it.   XG3 is in fact quite a stripped down affair. The smart developers over at Cheltenham apparently decided to focus on important things for a racing game, such as a great sense of speed, good course design, and while almost always maintaining a frame rate of 60, the display of intriguing course and background design. The game comprises three modes, League, Arcade, and Time Trial, and then there's XG Mall (in which players buy weapons, gadgets and engines), with League being the meat-and-potatoes of the game. Any mode will do to get the feel of speed.   Which is the thing about XG3. The real draw to it is its unadulterated sense of speed. XG3 simply delivers speed in spades, in blinks, in waves, in blisteringly fast scootie-skippers. Whatever you like. Unlike the magnetic bikes from the previous N64 versions, you ride bikes in XG3 that are all beautifully streamlined and sleek looking to the eye. They still very much maintain the look and feel from the previous versions, but they are now more detailed in design and more curvaceously shaped. But the bikes aren't differentiated by speed; engine size is earned in the League mode, and like everything in this game, it's paid for in cash.   Still, once you do earn large enough engines, the sense of speed gets even better. When you break the sound barrier, at 750 mph, you're given a lovely treat. As you hit the barrier, the screen around you blurs and every object appears to sizzle as it disappears past your eyes. Complementing this nice visual, the audio helps to create a serene, ethereal sense of speed. The techno music fades out seamlessly and is replaced by a quiet, lovely, low-level hum. At this point, you will truly feel something that few other games have delivered, and that only EA's SSX has managed to create (though it created a wonderful sense of flying through the air, rather than a sense of speed). Also, players can adjust the screen views, by pressing select for an overview perspective, or for an even faster perspective, the cockpit view does nicely (though it may also make you sick).   What assists in this blissful experience is the luscious course design. Bettering themselves by learning from the wretched Extreme-G2, Studio Cheltenham has created courses that have fewer branches in each course, but wider courses, and more well-designed, well thought out and nicely placed turns, curves, dips and loops. What's key here methinks is the wideness of the courses. They instantly remind me of F-Zero, because several riders fit side by side (though not as many as in F-Zero, of course), but also because you have leeway to learn how to drive them. They don't restrict, they don't cram; instead, they allow for players to mess up a little, and come back. And players are going to need this leeway at the speeds they're traveling.   Playing through all of the leagues and classes in the last few days, I learned that Studio Cheltenham has added one of the most important elements. In XG3, players can access to numerous deadly weapons and gadgets, all of which benefit players while they'll bullying past the other 11 racers on screen. These add depth and create a new level of tension and concern while racing at breakneck speeds across the tracks. But they're not the game's primary focus. They help you and hinder the opponent, or vice versa, but they're created to enhance the overall driving experience, built around skill-based driving. Whatever kinds of weaponry you accrue, the most important skill in this game still is knowing the courses, learning how to manage speed, and being able to drive as fast as possible. In the end, thankfully, it's all about racing.   The class and league system needs some explaining. In the beginning players can join as many as six teams, each with two riders, and all of the bikes geared up with the same size engine. By selecting the League mode, players can choose a team, a team driver, all lavishly described with historical significance and team personality, and they begin with a little bit of money. Starting with the 250G division, players then work their way up to the 500G and 750G divisions, and finally the 1000G levels. In all, there are four leagues (Lithium, Rubidium, Caesium, and Francium), and in each league players must pass through three races to enter into the next one. Once all three leagues are beaten, then players move up into the next speed class.   My biggest complaints? Despite all of these good things, the game is not perfect. It's damn fast but having been a Wipeout fan for ages, this game smacks of unoriginality. I mean, everything about it seems ripped straight from the Wipeout series. Sure, even Wipeout borrowed from other games, too, but it was original in its formulation, design, craft design, and in its choice of music. XG3, in many ways, is Wipeout on bikes. And because of this heavy borrowing it doesn't feel very genuine to me. Of course, it is genuinely its own game, especially in the control and special effects departments. But I never felt, while playing, a strong attachment to it. It took me about four hours to get over that, and by that time I was hooked. Many people may never feel this, but I'm betting diehard Wipeout fans will feel that same way.   Also, XG3 is a tad short. I beat it relatively quickly, and what's more there are only 10 courses. I want more courses! I feel like there should be as many as two to three more classes, too, and about five more courses. Sure, there are arcade and time trial modes, but I just wanted more. Thus, the game is shorter than I expected. I mean everything is short compared to GT3, but just compared to a regular racing game, it's over quite quickly. And lastly, the framerate doesn't hold up in the rain courses. The rain effect is boss (old skool for ~cool~), but the framerate drops noticeably when more than three vehicles are on the course at one time in the rain. It creates a disorienting feeling that affects the gameplay a touch.   Graphics Three visual items stand out in XG3: course city design, special effects, and framerate. I've spoken enough about framerate (it's 60 fps and good), but I haven't really touched upon the special effects and the backgrounds.   The special effects come in three flavors, environmental, bike, and weapon. The first things you'll notice are the environmental effects, and they are very nice indeed. Immediately upon starting a race, players see a nice wave of heat, blurring the air as the bike exhaust pipes ooze exhaust. It may have been in other games, but it's still sweet looking. Then when they start playing in the Megapolis mode, and it starts raining, the rain effects in the air and on your ~visor,~ are visually appealing, too. The rain effects are damn fine. You can even see the rain being pushed around by the wind in mid-air. When it hits your bike, it splatters on your visor (i.e. the TV screen) and then drizzles down. If you saw the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo then you'll recognize it -- Acclaim did an excellent job on this little but effective special effect detail.   The bike effects are sweet looking, too. They're produced by the gadgets and weapons. But one that you may see instantly and forget about is simple, yet very satisfying. Each bike produces a flare of fuel that trails from the two exhaust pipes, and they create a pretty scene when you see two or three bikes in the distance. Also, weaponry such as the micro machines, drop like little explosive jacks and tinkle across the screen. The Heat Seekers create a to-die-for effect, in which a red circle targets slowly in on its victim, and it's nice too. The Flash Morter, among many others, also produce nice visual effects.   What I really took notice of, however, are the course designs. Sure, they're nicely laid out, but in terms of visual design, they're wonderful. While courses such as Verdegrande and Atradaitoshi are cool looking, Oceania and Pasiphae are just short of stunning. These cut underground into the ocean and enable racers to burst through transparent tubes that are dazzling, or they range high into the air like a roller coaster and then come barreling down like thunder. The courses all share something in common, too, which are the physical supports, tubes, and metallic arms that hold everything up. And while theses races do take place in the future, the mere fact that the courses are held up by something visual and viable, something from our time, somehow balances out, and strangely puts in concrete terms the sometimes distant worlds of XG3. It's just cool to look at these huge cities and environments.   Sound Now, I like techno, but I'm not a big techno buff, so I know that I'm entering into treacherous territory right now, but screw it, here I go. I like the music in XG3; it works for me. I'm not particularly picky either. I'm not that persnickety when it comes to music, unless it sucks. XG3's music is just fine for me. The menu music, at least in many of my compatriots' opinion, is harsh and annoying. It features an alarm sample that can be grating. For me? I liked it and it didn't bother me a bit. (Ha! What do they know?) The in-game music, at least in my humble opinion, is good stuff, but none of it sticks out so much that I want a XG3 soundtrack or anything.   The sound effects, such as the one I mentioned earlier during the breaking of the sound barrier, are fantastic, too. The game produces several various zooming effects; when you pass other vehicles and when they pass you lovely zipping, zooming, and swooshing sounds make you feel the passing. A heavy doe of mechanical engine sounds accompany this game as well, but the engines never sound as good as realistic car engines, and even though Acclaim wasn't going for realism, these engines sound weaker than I would have liked.If you are a fan of the Extreme-G series and you own a PS2, well then it's an easy decision. Go buy it; you'll love it. XG3 is easily the best of the three in the series, and although I recommend it to arcade racing fans, I would make note that it's a little shorter than I would have liked, there aren't that many courses, and it's not quite as deep as I wanted. Those who are waiting for Wipeout Fusion may be confused. You may just want to go ahead and spend on this game, or at least rent it to see, because it's very fast, it's beautiful, and it's engaging, challenging and fun. Plus, XG3 stands on its own with great responsive control, very respectably designed courses, and a pure, simple arcade feel that's unique to this game alone. But on the other hand, you may not like this at all. Like I said before, it took me a while to get into it, but I eventually ended up liking it. In the racing category for the PlayStation 2 right now, there is nothing quite like XG3. It's a futuristic arcade racing game played on hypnotic bikes in outrageously designed courses amongst gorgeous, huge 3D backgrounds. GT3 is about realism, and XG3 is all about blistering arcade speed. So, if speed's your bag, you'll love XG3.", "date": "Aug 22, 2001"}
