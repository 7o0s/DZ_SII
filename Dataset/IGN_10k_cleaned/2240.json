Those who have checked out the show will know that Dexter is a boy genius who creates incredible gadgets in his lab, only to be pestered by his annoying (and dim) sister, Dee Dee.  Most of Dexter's adventures involve him creating an amazing new gadget only to have his doe-eyed sister come in to ruin it.  Dexter's Laboratory: Deesaster Strikes nails this premise perfectly.  Features 70 levels Eight unique areas Only for Game Boy Advance  In the game, you play boy genius Dexter.  Things are going just dandy until Dexter's meddlesome sister hops inside his new Clone-a-matic and creates dozens of clones of herself.  The numerous Dee Dees overrun Dexter's enormous lab.  To restore order to the lab, Dexter must recover the many Dee Dees as well as fix the machines she's broken.    Dexter's lab is divided into eight different areas.  Each area has a different theme including a Robotics Lab and a Nuclear Power Station.  At the start of the game you can only access the Aviation Hanger.  The other seven areas become unlocked as you gather more Dee Dees.  You don't have to finish one area before going on to the next, as long as you have caught a sufficient number of Dee Dees.  It's always a plus when a game allows you to return to previous levels at any point during the game.  You'll probably want to finish up each level one at a time, but it isn't necessary to do them in order.  Standing in your way of gathering all the Dee Dees are numerous puzzles as well as some creatures and robots you'll have to contend with.  Hidden throughout each level are weapons and tools to assist you in your quest.  Most useful will be the Zap-a-tron and the Splurgerator, guns that can take out most enemies.  You'll also find remote controlled items like rockets and flying saucers that will help you solve some of the puzzles.    Most of the puzzles are easy to figure out and are just a matter of finding the right item and getting the job done.  When you do come across a wandering Dee Dee, use your Grabber Arm to catch her and then take her to the nearest available suction tube.  The main problem with completing your goals isn't the obstacles in your way, but the controls.  At times Dexter is just a pain to move around and he can actually get stuck in certain spots, forcing you to restart your GBA.  When jumping across platforms, you'll swear you're hitting jump before you walk off the platform, but will still end up falling to your doom.  It can get frustrating, but it doesn't happen often.   Though each level has a different theme with different enemies to defeat, the game has a tendency to be repetitive.  A lot of puzzles are very similar and the levels sometimes seem too alike.  Dexter's Lab is a pretty big game.  To collect all the Dee Dees and repair every machine requires a good investment of time.  Even though the tasks can get repetitive, the game is still addicting enough to make you continue until you've finished.    The graphics in Dexter's Laboratory are nothing to drool over, but they're passable.  A lot of the levels feel a bit plain though and unmemorable.  The music can best be described as a carnival theme.  Often in handheld games, the music can be annoying and even painful, but here it fits nicely and never grinds on your nerves.  As a fan of Dexter's Laboratory, I was looking forward to this game.  I was a little disappointed that there weren't more crazy inventions to use.  At times the game can feel pretty repetitive, but for the most part it's entertaining.  What's missing most is the flair.   Virtucraft Ltd. could have gone a bit more over the top to make catching Dee Dee more rewarding.  If you're a fan of the cartoon and you want to spend some time with a familiar theme, you'll probably want to pick up this game.  If you're looking for a game with a lot of variety and deep challenge, this is a rental for sure.", "date": "Nov 10, 2001"}
