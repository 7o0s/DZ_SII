Doesn't mater how many cars you jacked in GTA and how big of a boom you made in Halo. If you haven't dropped a quarter to spend time with Bub and Bob, then shame on you.   And speaking of shame, shame on Mforma for releasing this awful, lazy, watered down port of the classic arcade action-puzzle game.   About the only thing this game gets right is the sprite of Bub, which doesn't have really any frames of animation, mind you. The boards are rough approximations of the originals, filled with enemy creates that you must capture in bubbles and then pop to clear. They leave behind fruit to boost your score. You can also pick up bonus bubbles to spell EXTEND and get extra dinos.   Oh, and yes, the game does play the classic theme, but it's a screeching MIDI version that you will want to shut off as quick as humanly possible.   However, this version of Bubble Bobble -- which sells for $5.99 on the Sprint PCS Vision service -- is so ridiculously slow and buggy that our collective jaws dropped. The bonus bubbles that spell EXTEND would occasionally flash the sprite for an enemy or Bub. We jumped clean through bubble-d enemies. And when we did pop enemy bubbles, the monster fell off the screen, only to reappear at the top and keep on falling. How does something like that get out of test?   We tried the game on a Sanyo 8100, a pretty competent gaming phone. Not the best rig on the market, but it's in thousands of palms, so it's not a bad handset to benchmark with. Even powering off the phone and reloading the game didn't help. Do yourself and your cellphone bill a huge favor and pass on this bizarro bad port.  In a word: crap-tastic.", "date": "Aug 20, 2004"}
