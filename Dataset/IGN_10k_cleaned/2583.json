I love watching tennis and I've enjoyed playing it on game systems, ever since Sega delivered the stunningly deep Virtua Tennis nearly three years ago on Dreamcast. And even though I'm in love with Sega's particular tennis title, there is a certain pull, a recognizably realistic feel, a level of challenge that's undeniably built into the Smash Court Tennis's core that delivers amazingly well.   Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament isn't the prettiest tennis game in the world, but it's a respectable, playable game that, according to its own style and pace, works well. It's stacked high with some of the best and most popular professional players on the circuit, it's relatively well constructed with a few good modes in which to play, and it offers players four pro circuit courts from all over the world. Given the current competition on the system to date (i.e. none), Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament is the best thing tennis gamers could ask for.    Don't take that as a cheap shot, though. Smash Court is undeniably deep, challenging, and it'll surprise you with subtle gameplay, surprisingly tough AI, and long, tense rallies. It'll also beat you up with its steep jump in opponent toughness, forcing you to play the perfect game to win. In short, tennis fans will be surprised at just how addicting Smash Court is, despite its rough presentation.    Gameplay  After a handful of Japanese PlayStation outings most of which have been the stealthiest of releases, the Smash Court series has finally made it Stateside. Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament represents the reemergence of tennis as a viable sports game on next-generation systems, largely thanks to Sega's Virtua Tennis in the arcades and on Dreamcast, and despite Namco's attempts in the past at the sport. Smash Court Tennis comes to the PS2 with healthy set of features and a rock-solid gameplay foundation, and gamers will find that it is only really lacking in a few areas.    Featuring eight major tennis stars and a handful of fictitious ones, along with four real pro tennis courts, Namco appears to have gotten the tennis formula right, signing long-time stars in the men's and women's categories, including the likes of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. The whole roster stars Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Patrick Rafter, Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the men's camp, and Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles, and every teenage boy's um, favorite ~player,~ Anna Kournikova in the women's category.    Smash Court Tennis features a sampling of each kind of court, too, from clay to grass to hard surface. This list includes The Arthur Ashe Stadium of the US Open (hard court), the Australian Open (hard court), the Tournoi De Paris at the Stade International de Paris (clay court), and the classic grass court found on England's Wimbleton court. Each arena does indeed play differently, and players will need to adjust their game to succeed, including changing the speed of play and altering topspins and slices to hit just right.   The players all resemble their real-life counterparts respectably well, and they are crafted to play with the same kinds of characteristics, grouped into ~All-Around Player,~ ~Net Player,~ or ~Fast Stroke,~ indicating their play styles. The fact that so many pros are featured enables gamers and tennis fans to truly sink their teeth into the game, but even more to the point, gamers can play out their fantasies by vying as the very best pros in the game. And when I say fantasies, yes I do mean that the selection is quite scrumptious.    Deep down below the expensive pro licenses, fancy pro arenas (and Anna Kournikova's slim, athletic polygonal loveliness), the gameplay in Smash Court is a highly tuned arcade game much resembling Sega's effort, bringing amazing depth and challenge to the genre, as well as a brutally tough pro circuit.   Much like previous versions in the Smash Court series, which has been altered to deliver Virtua Tennis like sensibilities, Smash Court Tennis offers a few decent modes to play. Gamers get to grips with Exhibition (a single set), Arcade (like Pro Tournament, but enabling two to four players to jump in), Time Attack (clear matches in record time), and Challenge, a training mode. Exhibition and Arcade modes feature four-player games, for those who own Multitaps, while Time Attack is for one to two players.    Smash Court Tennis delivers an unbelievably good four-player experience using the Multitap, and if you do buy this game, then definitely purchase a Multitap -- you won't be sorry. Players pair up in doubles tournaments and can mix and match women and men teams, or play women against men, creating a virtually unlimited amount of depth to the doubles play, which again, is remarkably fun, deep, and rewarding. One game is simply not enough in Doubles. Just prepare to waste a good four hours in this mode alone.    When it comes to the controls, Smash Court has the moves down. The gameplay is basic, relying on three kinds of hits, powerful topspins (Circle button), slices (X button), and drops/lops (Triangle). However, it's anything but simplistic. Players will find that Smash Court is truly a sport of refinement, requiring expertise in every facet. Several factors feed into the game's subtleties, from slight weight changes, minute directional alterations, and perfect placement on the court, all of which will either make or break your game. The computer tells you whether you've hit the ball well, displaying a message (~Nice~) on screen, which increases the ball speed, but this requires good swing timing and perfect body placement, along with proper directional placement.    Gamers will find that learning the basic set of swings is easy enough, and in any of the modes, beginners can win a game or two right off the bat. However, in Pro Tournament mode, things quickly turn grueling. Regardless of the player you select in men's or women's games, the level of difficulty in the third match is ratcheted up far steeper than the previous two, and believe me, its a rude awakening. I originally selected Monica Seles, and in the third round I played Martina Hingis. She spanked my ass dozens of times before I finally upped my skills to beat her, and that was by the skin of my teeth.    Seles is a Fast Stroke player, so I switched to Sampras, an All-Around player. I progressed to the fourth match, and repeatedly lost to Rafter, who in real life has lost more times to Sampras than he's won. That didn't bother me too much, though, because I enjoy a good fight. The point is the difficulty level of the pro circuit is truly unbalanced, and it'll take players days upon days to beat all four arenas. Regardless of who is better in real life, the last four matches of the Pro Tournament will make you talk to yourself, swear out loud, and rethink every aspect of your strategy. You will then lose again. However one looks at it, this mode is a tough cookie to crack, and winning just one of the four opens is an accomplishment. Few will finish the full game.    Adding to the discomfort with the Pro Challenge is the serving toughness. It's hard to serve well in real tennis, and while this is a videogame, it appears just as difficult to serve here. Players should instantly quit using the Dpad if they want a chance at serving even decently, and deploying the ~subtleness~ of the left analog stick should be done with great care. Rarely did I ever serve in the same place twice, and never did I serve an ace. In fact, rarely did the AI serve an ace. It's a rare occurrence here, even though it happens often in the pros. The serving game does improve with much practice and patience.    What's unfortunate about the Pro Tournament mode is that, besides the obvious toughness, it's not complemented by a deep training mode, the way Sega's game is. The Challenge mode is relatively easy in comparison and doesn't deliver enough direction for beginning players. It's not always obvious is you're performing the training right, and there isn't enough of a variety of challenges to improve your game either.    Despite the steep challenge and the legitimate complaints, Smash Court Tennis offers undeniably deep gameplay, if you're willing to stick with it. Players will find that they can play every angle of the game, switching up from slices to topspin slams to lobs and perfectly angled drops, too. In fact, I was surprised at how fun the net game is. Pros with an ~All-Around~ and ~Net Game~ status are especially apt in playing the net, which requires excellent anticipation and quick reactions. As Sampras, I smoked Rafter several times with well-timed net vollies, perfectly anticipating his shots. Playing the net is totally addictive.   The gameplay is so solid that I was surprised several times. Just like in real tennis, this game requires deep concentration and actually puts you into a rhythm. Long, baseline rallies, corner shots, and slam returns are all totally reasonable examples of gameplay strategy. I was stunned as I stepped to mid-court and then promptly returned as many as four opponent slams in a row, and then took the point on the final swing. Players can dive and roll to pick up difficult shots near the net, while if they anticipate shots well enough, they can stretch out to reach hard-to-get hits that appear seemingly out of reach.    Graphics  There are at least two things that Namco needed to have achieved to succeed visually. First, it needed to represent the licensed pro athletes well. Second, this is a next-generation game, and thus the visual expectations from framerate to textures to cutscenes should be excellent.    And I'm afraid that in both cases, Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament doesn't quite deliver the realistic looks we were all hoping to see. Yes, from a distance, you can distinguish Monica Seles from Martina Hingis from the lovely Anna Kournikova based on their general body shape, clothes selection, and hair styles, but when the camera comes within a good 10 feet of the player, the good looks are all just genericized into a white-skinned ball of average facial polygons.    A few of the players look relatively close to their real life counter-parts, including Monica Seles, Martina Hingis and Andre Agassi, for instance, but Pete Sampras looks like Tom Hanks, Patrick Rafter looks like pretty much any white male on the streets of an British colony, and in my humble opinion, Anna Kournikova cold have looked a whole lot better. They didn't mess her up, and her um, physique, is quite likeable, but facially, she looks like pretty much any young, thin woman.    With a few minor differences, the players all appear to share the same body movements and strokes, serves and backhands, and it's just the vague body shape that ends up being the distinguishing factor. The cut-scenes are disappointing, too. They're edited with too many shots shown too quickly, the special blur effect employed lessens the desired effect, and overall, they're entirely worth skipping every time.    The fact is, overall, Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament is a decent looking game at best. It never fails in any particular area, but it doesn't exceed in any particular area either. Visually, the game has a decent sense of finish and polish, but you can see aliasing every so often and a rough-around-the-edges feel creeps into everything. Running at about 30 frames per second, it feels mostly smooth, without ever hitting a rough spot or a major slowdown, but it never feels crisp, clean, or sharp.    As for the four stadia, each one has its own sense of presence and it's own set of paraphernalia, i.e. balls boys, stadium shape, court color, etc. The crowd is average in visual presentation, presenting an assortment of colored shirts and a few body shapes, and enough minimum animations to remain a presence while you're concentrating on the ball and the opponent.    Sound  Smash Court Tennis is a very simple game with regard to sound. Music is relegated to the cutscenes, intros and menus, while the in-game sounds comprise grunts, tennis balls hitting rackets and courts, and otherwise complete silence. It's excellent that way since you'll need all of the quite you can get.    To take it one step further, if players want to play the Pro Tournament, they should play it in complete isolation because even the slightest distraction will ruin your rhythm and concentration. Lastly, with a wonderful sense of grace and elegance, Namco has quieted down the harsh grunts of certain female individuals, and for that we're very thankful.I like tennis games, and I was prepared to like this game, but nearly as much as I figured. Smash Court Tennis requires more than just a few hours of play to dig into its deep wealth of usually balanced arcade tennis, and it's definitely worth buying. The single player modes are good, and the four-player modes are unbelievably entertaining. I lost sleep, gained blisters, and earned myself a decent level of self-esteem by beating these polygonal players, and in the end, despite imbalanced Pro Tournament mode, I enjoyed the brutal string of losses because I eventually won. Good but not great, Smash Court doesn't need much to evolve into an awesome tennis game. The gameplay basics are there, as I was able to witness through stunningly long sets, rallies, and comebacks. If Namco had done a few things, it would have shined like a star. And do, here is my own little laundry list of improvements. The game needs to be better, more properly tuned and balanced. The playing style of the pros should have been more individualized, and they to play a little more like their individual selves. There should have been more depth to the practice mode, and Namco should have crafted a slightly more forgiving and accurate serve mode. It's the details that make or break a game, and 2/3 of this game is rock-solid. All I can say is I can't wait for next year.", "date": "Mar 29, 2002"}
