Contra was a conversion of their arcade shooter that had a soldier running left-to-right through an alien -infested jungle, unleashing a huge barrage of firepower acquired throughout the levels. Konami saw that it was good, and spawned sequels over a zillion systems, including the Gameboy, Genesis, and the SNES.Today, the power of 32-bit systems demand that successful game franchises move into the third dimension. The original Contra team, Treasure, has been replaced by Appaloosa Interactive, a competent developer that got a bit too ambitious with Konami's shooter in the 32-bit conversion process.This isn't to say that Contra: Legacy of War is a bad game. It's not. It's just that their approach to adapting a 2D game to 3D was less than ideal. Most notably, their camera angle makes it difficult to play. It starts out beautifully familiar, with an over the shoulder POV, facing forward, with plenty of room to move and to see aliens approaching. Unfortunately, when you need to run left-to-right, the camera fails to change perspective. Trying to maneuver around slow-moving bullets becomes an exercise in frustration because of the disorienting perspective. Some perspectives work better than others, but you'll wish the camera swung a lot higher to make the viewable area wide enough.To their credit, Appaloosa did create a smoothly animated 3D world. Terrain and bosses are polygonal, with character sprites plastered on as bitmaps. Unfortunately, when too many enemies and projectiles appear on the screen, serious slowdown plagues the game (and it happens quite a lot).There are some pretty cool features, which unfortunately meets with mixed success. They keep the two player mode from previous versions, making it a better group game, but slowdown increases exponentially as well.. There's also a choice of 4 different characters, each with their own abilities, but their designs are fairly generic. One bright spot, though, is 3D pad support, making shooting in all directions ten times easier.Then there are the useless gimmicks. One, actually: 3D mode. You can don the cheesy red-blue glasses for an extremely flickery depth perspective. The problem - you cannot turn off the effect in the middle of the game.Contra: Legacy of War is a somewhat fun, mindless shooter that will fill the void until a better 3D Contra-style game comes around. Fans of the series, give it a shot, if only to see Contra in 3D.", "date": "Dec 8, 1998"}
