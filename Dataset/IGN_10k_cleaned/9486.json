The crying, the feeding, the diaper changing. Especially the diaper changing. So it's more than a little odd that such an activity, known to be so troublesome and annoying in the real world, would be chosen to become a video game  but, sure enough, it's arrived as Imagine: Babyz. Essentially a virtual pet game where the pet is a human child instead of a dog or cat, Imagine: Babyz ends up being just about as fun as its real world counterpart  meaning not very much fun at all.   It's the touch screen control that's the trouble. On the surface, the game is cute, and inoffensive. You play as a teenaged girl whose grandmother has left on vacation, and has left you in charge of her home. Neighbors arrive and ask you to watch their kids for them, just like Granny always did, and you get to bring the little boys and girls into the house and take care of them for a while. Again, all very cute and inoffensive. But the offense begins when you first bring down your stylus to touch the screen.   Even entering your name is a chore, so imprecise is Imagine: Babyz's recognition of your stylus' input. It's an inauspicious start to what becomes an annoying ~adventure~  as you'll find the touch control is lacking when you're trying to select letters, or rock a baby to comfort it, or feed it its Gerber dinner. It seems to register a ~hit~ several pixels away from where you've placed the tip of the pen, or it demands that you follow along with an on-screen graphic like a rolling ball rather than dragging on the screen to move the ball yourself.   Those mini-games not using the touch screen will often employ the DS mic instead, like the   That's a second annoyance  abstract, loose instructions for how to play Babyz's mini-games. Like any other virtual pet game on the DS, each activity for interacting with or caring for your digital child here is represented by a brief mini-game design. But the execution of these designs is often off-target. Rocking an upset baby back and forth is represented by a ball rolling along a semi-circular track, and you're asked to touch a button at the two ends of the track to send it rolling back in the opposite direction once it overlaps a green-colored zone. But no matter where you try to tap and complete this action, nothing seems to register right  the ball just ends up slowing to a stop, and the uncomforted child wails in your arms.   So girls will certainly get frustrated there, as well as with the various other lacking implementations included in Babyz's handful of mini-game designs. From the off-center positioning of your point of control of the vacuum cleaner in the attic-cleaning game, to the too-demanding ~follow the moving spoon~ mechanic in the feeding mini-game, to pretty much every other included design, there's always something that feels oddly off and incorrect about each experience. It's hard to have any fun at all.   Where Imagine: Babyz gets things right is in its look and visual design. The 3D babies are undeniably adorable, and dressing them up in different outfits and goofy costumes can be entertaining to see  there's even a set of ninja gear you can have the babies wear. Even this positive element is held back by another negative, though, in that shopping for new clothes and other items to help make you babysitting easier or more fun is handled through a too-slow ~online shopping~ interface. You earn money and coupons for successfully caring for kids, but you can't receive any immediate reward when redeeming those earnings  you have to ~order~ items that you want, rather than just getting them automatically when you pay for them. It's upsetting that a message tells you you can't play the painting mini-game, because you don't have any paint, even after you've just spent several dollars specifically buying paint. Ridiculous.The concept of a virtual babysitting game  or, more precisely, a virtual pet game with humans as the pets  is immediately questionable, and should have most gamers raising an eyebrow at the idea. But that's not where Imagine: Babyz is a letdown. Its concept is actually handled fairly well, casting you as teenaged girl with a good heart simply wanting to care for young kids to help out her grandma, and the babies are presented in an accessible, adorable way. The problem is in the game's execution, as poor touch screen control and muddy explanations of what you're supposed to do mar each of the many mini-game designs. Imagine: Babyz is a game that looks fine and fun, but just isn't any fun to play  it's too frustrating to get into. You'll be left feeling like you're just had to change real diapers for hours on end. It's a pain.", "date": "Nov 13, 2007"}
