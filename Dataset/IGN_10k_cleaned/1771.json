I'm definitely not saying that this game's a poor title -- far from it. In fact, the game has improved a ton since our early look at the title a few months ago. It's just that, with all the things you can do in this game, the designers forgot to put one simple element into the mix -- challenge. Features Three playable characters 30 missions Nine vehicles Password save Only for Game Boy Color   Don't bust your rump trying to find Army Men Sarge's Heroes for the Game Boy Color -- it doesn't exist. 3DO decided, for whatever reason, to jump straight to the sequel in the Army Men spinoff, confusing gamers and retailers all over the US. But, hey, it's what the company wanted to do, even if we don't quite understand why -- I'm guessing it's because the publisher wanted to get their new buxom female hero, Vikki, out on the Game Boy market as soon as possible, and her introduction to the videogame world was the console versions of Army Men Sarge's Heroes 2. But I digress. Sarge's Heroes 2 puts you in the role of three plastic soldiers -- and you have your choice of any of the three at the start of each of the game's 30 missions. The missions themselves range from destroying all enemy vehicles in an area, to blowing up all the bunkers in a zone, to escorting a vehicle from point A to B, to protecting your base from a brutal assault on all sides.  The game's biggest difference from Digital Eclipse's Army Men and Army Men 2 for the Game Boy Color is that Sarge's Heroes 2 is completely vehicle based. There are no foot missions -- all your combat is done from the comfort of the game's nine vehicles -- three different air, sea, and land machines that are specific to the character you choose. For example, if you pick Vikki in an air mission, she'll float around in a speedy but weak hangglider -- select Scorch and you'll cruise around in a well-built helicopter. Your on-screen characters' abilities all depend on your selection at the beginning of the mission, so it's up to you to choose wisely.  Actually, it really doesn't matter -- though the designers obviously put a lot of effort into the game design, there's one thing missing that causes the title to drag on. There's absolutely no challenge to Army Men: Sarge's Heroes. Missions vary, but there's no sense of urgency since you can literally plow through the hazards without worry that you'll kill your guy. Enemy AI is a joke -- the enemy can't target your vehicle as quickly as you can nail him. There are one or two missions out of the load that will require a bit more cautious playing to complete, but most missions just drag simply because there's absolutely no technique in completing them -- it's all a matter of driving forward, following the on-screen arrow, and holding down the fire button. The only challenge is withstanding the boredom that bubbles out of some of the ridiculously huge maps that take 15 minutes or more to complete.  And its obvious that some of the game was drawn by the same artist that provided the horrendous-looking cutscenes in Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- whoever's responsible should really lay off the comic book look, because it just comes out ugly as hell on the Game Boy Color screen. The rest of the game, though, looks rather decent, with plenty of frames of rotation for each of the vehicles and nice looking explosions when the enemy bites the dust. The one huge negative against the game engine is the terrible slowdown that shows up, even when there's only three vehicles on screen.  The Army Men series has faired pretty well in the Game Boy Color market, even when taking flak for the lame PlayStation and PC versions. Unfortunately, this game is the first ~bad~ Army Men title for the system -- it's a shame, since there's good elements employed in the game: in-game graphics and control being the two highpoints. But without any challenge, playing Sarge's Heroes 2 is more a chore than it is fun -- and it's because of this that I can't really recommend marching to the store to fight the plastic fight in this edition.", "date": "Feb 7, 2001"}
