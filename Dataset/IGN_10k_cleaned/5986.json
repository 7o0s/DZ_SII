(It can't even really manage to pull off ~mediocre~ with any degree of credibility, either.) This 3D snowboarding event is hands-down one of the best mobile games you have yet played, as well as the best V CAST game as of yet on the Verizon deck.   Remember all of those cool snowboarding games you used to play before EA's SSX burst through at the PlayStation 2 launch and pretty much wiped out the field? Massive Snowboarding is a lot like those -- think Nintendo's 1080 (on Nintendo 64, not GameCube) and Rippin' Riders on Dreamcast and you have an idea of the fun and flavor of Massive. Fast-paced runs down steep snow-covered mountains and tricks that result in high scores you like to brag about.   The vitals are such: Five hip riders take off down eight courses spread across four different mountains. While that doesn't necessarily sound like a lot of terrain -- especially considering a single run can be completed in a couple minutes -- Massive Snowboarding's longevity comes from its incredible replay value. You are assigned goals to meet, such as performing tricks for the camera or crossing the finish line first. Completing these typically requires a series of practice runs, as I cannot imagine a single player that will nail a pitch-perfect run right out of the gate.   The ride challenge portion of the game requires you to execute tricks from a checklist. Every time you hit a trick, it is marked on your list and you can concentrate on hitting the next one. You do not have to do every trick in a single run. Much like, say, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, you can attack these objectives over a series of runs. Meeting goals opens up new courses. The Rival Races are more straightforward, with you having to square off against another rider and reach the bottom of the hill first. The third challenge, Video Shoot, is to perform tricks for a camera by launching your boarder off of a jump -- even better, you get to watch your run from multiple angles.   Control is essential for a game of this type -- it's typically either a make or break proposition. Massive Snowboarding feels good to the touch. Gameloft made sure to simplify the general design, the ~5~ button controls all the jumps and tricks, while the thumbpad works the slope steering and trick movement in midair. This set-up is actually deeper than it sounds, as it is possible to stream together tricks with solid practice, just by learning proper button pressing sequences.   As expected, and evidenced by these screens, Massive Snowboarding is a looker. The character design features real personality, not unlike Gameloft's Love Triangle. Each rider has a variety of boards they can choose from before heading out to the mountain. Trick animations are strong, too, with models doing full deep knee bends as they get ready to fling themselves into the air. And it is near impossible not to smile when you see your rider break his/her back flopping on top of a grind rail.   The mountains themselves are appropriately white and blue, but it is easy to discern the location of bumps, jumps, and other obstacles. The mountain trails are also designed with a few branching paths, so it takes a few runs to sometimes see the whole thing.   The audio is also strong, with nicely recreated powder sounds, voice samples throughout the game, and the Sum 41 tune ~Hell Song~ looped over the titles.  There is nobody I cannot recommend Massive Snowboarding to -- it really is one of the best ~video game~ mobile games I have played in some time. Even the most ardent puzzler fans would be well-served checking this title out, just to see what else their handset has to offer. V CAST needs more games like this to really get people excited about the service. If I was Verizon, I'd make sure Massive Snowboarding was playing on all of my V CAST phones at retail locations -- it's the kind of game that could move a phone.", "date": "Sep 7, 2005"}
