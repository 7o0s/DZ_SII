{"name": "Manchester United Club Football", "name_review": "Club Football 2005 Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/10/22/club-football-2005-review", "text": "Codemasters has a pretty good idea with their Club Football games. Rather than merely offering up a single standard football game, they've decided to offer up different versions that each showcase one particular club. The PC version we're reviewing features the Red Devils, Manchester United, but there are other editions featuring Bayern Munich, Arsenal, Ajax, Real Madrid, Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund.  Fans of each club will enjoy the authenticity of their own edition. The opening video of the Man United edition features a great opening video showcasing the specific players, fans and the stadium. You can buy extra videos and packages of stickers by spending points earned through play. A section on club history and profiles of notable players are also included. Though the range of headlining clubs is fairly short (and high in quality) you can play against up to 250 different teams from various clubs in tournament or exhibition mode with variable game length and difficulty settings.  So far, so good, but it's certainly nothing terribly surprising. One new thing that did get us excited is the new career mode. You can now create a rookie player and add them to the existing squads. Narcissist that I am, I made myself using a variety of sliders very much like those found in The Sims or Star Wars Galaxies (in both of which I also made myself; just trying to make the gaming world a sexier place, I suppose). Even if you don't want to make me, there are lots of other variations almost as attractive.  But it's not just about looking good. You'll also have 1000 points to spend (a rookie gets 1000?!?) on the various skills of the game. You'll earn more points by completing passes, tackling players and taking shots. As you play you'll be able to spend those points to raise your abilities. imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmedia.ign.com%2Fpc%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F559%2F559377%2Fmanchester-united-club-football-2005-20041022051707819-000.jpg&caption=With yourself on the team, you can opt to player only as the player you created; the AI will run the other players. While this makes for an interesting experience, it's harder to appreciate the game from this perspective. Though playing a single position, you can move around the field and call for the pass if you find yourself open. The AI tends to hang around a bit too much, so you'll find yourself working just a bit harder to compensate.  And speaking of compensation... the game comes with several classic matches from the team's past. In most cases, these scenarios will start you in the middle of a game against a time that has a lead of one or two points. This puts a bit more of the pressure on you to perform and to reverse some of your club's bitterest defeats. An editor lets you set up matches on your own.   Though the club angle is a powerful sell initially, it's the gameplay that counts when considering long-term appeal. There are two main improvements here, one leading to quicker reactions, the other allowing the player finer control of the ball. A practice mode lets you try out each of these techniques until you get the hang of them.  In terms of the reactions, an extra button press can change a player's action animation immediately into another, making it much easier to change your tricks when enemies start coming towards you. It makes turning with the ball easier and also lets you get off those 135-degree passes. Though some of the transitions are jerky, the hundreds of animations are very natural and have a good rhythm.        The precision trigger system in Club Football conjures up associations with EA's Freestyle system. You can use the system to move the ball around your body, pulling it back in a retreat or moving it to an unguarded side of your body. The new command system also lets you face attackers on the run so it'll be easier to charge them down.  I'm still baffled from time to time with the game's choices for auto-switching me from defender to defender. It's similar to the scheme used in Winning Eleven but you can toggle it to change players only when you want to. This is preferred for players who don't want to find a defender in a key position go bolting off in the wrong direction while the defender chasing the ball stops to get a rock out of his cleat.  You can see from the screens that the game looks good. The likenesses of the players and the quality of the head and body modeling is high. Small touches like the reaction shots for goals or penalties add a lot of life to the game, making it a much more personal kind of experience. Unfortunately, these close-ups also reveal the terrible crowd graphics.  Announcers Gary Lineker and Barry Davies are on hand to provide meaningful and enjoyable commentary before and after the action. Though not my cup of whiskey, the music suits the club theme well.  For fans of the featured team, it's hard to go wrong. Now if someone would only make a UNCG women's soccer game... imageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmedia.ign.com%2Fpc%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F559%2F559377%2Fmanchester-united-club-football-2005-20041022051626432-000.jpg&caption=Getting this game over the FIFA series or Winning Eleven will primarily be a matter of your interest in Machester United (or any of the other franchises present here) rather than your interest in game mechanics or modes. The presentation for the game relies heavily on your love of a certain team. If that's sort of incidental to you, you'll still enjoy the actual game but you'll definitely be missing a good part of the experience.The mechanics and game modes offer a few new innovations. The new animation system makes your players a little quicker to respond. While interesting in concept, the experience of playing a single position all game tends to bring out some weaknesses in the game, particularly with regard to the cooperativeness of the AI. These are much less apparent when you're switching control from ball carrier to ball carrier.", "date": "Oct 22, 2004"}
