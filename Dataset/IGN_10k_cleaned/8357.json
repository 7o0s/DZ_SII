Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/10/spin-it-review", "text": "For over four years, mobile gamers have been tasked with matching three or more colored objects -- jewels, spheres, heads, rocks, animals -- and the formula has grown tiresome. But don't let the thought of another match-'em-up deter you from giving consideration to Reaxion's Spin-It! This match-three puzzler employs a rotation mechanic that adds an interesting, ahem, spin on an old formula, but the resulting game may be too difficult for the casual set.   The game screen is a rotating gear full of colored spheres. You use the directional pad to spin the screen and position the gear so three or more of like-colored spheres touch. Tiny arrows show where the spheres are about to tumble, giving you a chance to move the gear quickly before the pieces fall and settle. The larger the group you line up, the more bonuses you earn. When you line up three or more, you have a quick second to rotate the gear again to move another piece into place, possibly multiplying your points.   As you progress through the gears, making matches before time runs out, power pieces come into play. A wild card ball allows you to make matches of only two spheres. A paint ball colors the balls it comes into contact with, making for some major bonus opportunities. Bombs clear out entire sections of the gear when slammed into balls of the same color. These power pieces are merciful additions, because some of the later puzzle gears are so odd-shaped that you can really spin yourself into a corner by letting spheres tumbles into tiny alcoves.   Spin-It! includes extra game modes, such as Puzzle and Endless. Puzzle is particularly tough, as you're teased with a gear where all of the spheres are nestled in harmony. The gear is then spun around and you have to use a central piece to return the spheres back to where they belong, restoring said harmony. A little timer in the corner counts how long you've been playing and, I admit, around the five-minute mark on one puzzle I started to wonder what was wrong with me. What single move was I missing that would solve the puzzle?   Spin-It! was tested on an LG VX7000. The game is clean and colorful with a very easy-to-use interface. The audio flourishes used during play are pleasant. It's really a nice production, capped off with an online scoreboard for bragging rights.  So, I lied. Maybe we could use just one more match-three puzzle game. Spin-It! is a fun, clever little puzzler that should tickle genre fans. However, the game can get exceedingly difficult, which some players might find off-putting.", "date": "Apr 10, 2007"}
