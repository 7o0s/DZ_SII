This game was to be the stepping stone in the success of the new publisher's path. It was supposed to be released last year, but multiple development issues pushed the game back at least twice. Finally, the game is on shelves.  Backing Shadow Madness is Square USA veteran Ted Woolsey, the man responsible for the script treatment to the company's Final Fantasy III and Chrono Trigger, and the design for the company's first USA product, Secret of Evermore. Shadow Madness has the Square experience behind it, but unfortunately, the Square feel the design team went for just isn't there. Gameplay  Obviously Crave's foundation and blueprint for Shadow Madness is Square's Final Fantasy VII. Just looking at how the game works, in interface and gameplay, it's clear that the developer based its design on Square's RPG.  The story goes a little something like this. You control Stinger, an adventurer who witnessed the violent destruction of his village. Thinking he's the only survivor, he goes to investigate, finding residents either dead, dying, or suffering from a strange incoherent madness. As he leaves the village, he befriends Windfall, an aspiring mage who also has been orphaned by the destruction of the village. Eventually, you meet up with Harv-5, an automated farmer who lost his master to this mysterious force. Together, you set out to uncover what's happening to the villages and people.  As you wander through the land, you randomly encounter unseen enemy beasts and enter a battle interface  again, very similar to Final Fantasy VII. This turn-based combat gives you the ability to engage an enemy, attack him in an aggressive, normal, or  a defensive position. Your magic users can cast spells to attack creatures or assist teammates, as well as attack enemies with the weapons they wield. What's unique to Shadow Madness is the ability to avoid these annoying random encounters if you so choose. By listening to the sound of approaching enemies, you can hold down the L1 and R1 buttons; this will make you crouch down  and nine times out of 10 the enemy will blow by unseen. This helps out when you just want to rush to the next destination in your quest, but if you choose to avoid a battle, you won't get the necessary experience points to build your characters abilities.  There are a few mini-games during the quest, most notably the lockpicking ~game.~ This is nothing more than a game of ~Simon,~ where you follow the movements of two picks in a lock four times by using your controller's D-pad and buttons. Later in the game, you'll find a couple of truly misplaced first-person shooters that look like they were thrown in at the last minute.  There are a few inconstancy problems in the game design, though. While you're given access to lockpicking, some visible doors are blocked off so you can't enter them too early in the game. So what do the designers do? They put up a message, ~The door is locked.~ Um, can't I try and pick it? Nope. It would have been better if the designer's put up a message, ~The door won't budge.~ By saying it's locked, it's misleading.  And when you purchase weapons or armor, there's no way to tell if your characters will benefit from the new items until you buy them. Many times, you'll buy a weapon thinking that it'll give a certain character a higher attack attribute, but when you equip it, it actually shows you that the weapon actually reduces that attribute. Try and sell it back, and you'll only get a twentieth of what you bought it for. Wasted precious money. Annoying. Graphics  Without a doubt, if you could finger anything wrong with the game, it would be in this department. Let's break up the imagery into four distinct categories: map navigation, battle sequences,  FMV sequences, and mini games. Map Navigation When you move from location to location, you control polygonal characters over a flat, two-dimentional rendered background  very similar to Resident Evil or Final Fantasy VII. Move from room to room, and you get a different background, usually at a new camera angle.  Obviously there's not much 3D being pushed here, yet when more than five animated characters get on screen you can see an obvious amount of slowdown. What's worse is that the engine can't seem to handle detailed 3D graphics  faces look flat and lifeless, and it doesn't look like the figures are constructed with many polygons at all. In fact, they look like those old PlaySkool figures from my childhood.  Battle Sequences When you enter a battle with enemy beasts and such, you're taken to a fully 3D arena  an obvious ripoff of Final Fantasy VII. The problem here is, the textures lack detail so it's hard to tell exactly what it is you're fighting. The framerate isn't pretty, either  the camera sweeps around pretty damn choppy, and it sometimes gets confusing when the camera decides to get a little clever and zoom in on two characters duking it out. And even though the game borrows heavily from Square's game, the one thing the game doesn't seem to take is Square's flair for the dramatic. Oh, sure, there are a few spells that look cool when you unleash them (like Windleaf's Hawk spell), but don't expect to be blown away with elaborate, gorgeous spells like FFVII's Leviathan or Colossus  because the 3D engine Crave is using just can't handle it. Hell, the awesome spells in the game cut to rendered CG FMV, probably because of that reason. And speaking of FMV... FMV sequences In case you've missed out on PlayStation Phrases 101, FMV is just a cute term that means video clips. In Shadow Madness, some of the storyline unfolds through FMV which is rendered through CG (computer graphics  think Toy Story or A Bug's Life). This isn't uncommon, since Final Fantasy VII and VIII revolve heavily around the use of rendered FMV. However, let's be quite blunt: the FMV sequences in Shadow Madness suck. 90 percent of the video is ugly, choppy, low quality video  instead of unfolding the story, it draws attention to its poor quality. It almost hurts your eyes to watch a fly-by of a castle animating worse than a Saturday morning cartoon. But what's weird is some FMV is perfectly smooth  case in point, some of the rendered spells during a fight. It's obvious that some video was handled by different teams during different points in the game's development. Mini games As you dive deep into the game (at least 15 hours), you'll find a couple of first-person shooter games. These games were handled by the same team responsible for Powerslave by Playmates (developed by Lobotomy). The graphics aren't anything special, and in fact, they seem way out of place from the rest of the quest. They're a nice addition, but they don't add much to the overall game design.  There's not a lick of speech anywhere in Shadow Madness. The game unfolds all the dialogue using text boxes  honestly, it would have suited this game better if it had speech. Sure, it would have spanned more than the game's two CD's, but it would have broken away from the Final Fantasy VII feel, as well as give the characters true personality. Musically, the game sounds extremely similar to the style that Final Fantasy uses  you'll notice this right from the get-go when you enter your first battle. The game uses the PlayStation's FM chip for most of the game's orchestrations, and overall they're quite nice. There are many instances in the game where you'd expect sound effects, and there are none. For example, a running joke in the game is how a mage character pops in and out of view, filling you in on one of your quests. He pops in and disappears without a single sound. Why? Probably because the developers were rushed to get the game out the door.  RPGs fare differently than action, sports, and fighting games. The reason why you play them is to experience an elaborate story  the gaming element usually takes a back seat. In that sense, Shadow Madness should be reviewed much like a film or novel: character development, plot devices, dialogue, and even cinematography. The way Shadow Madness begins  you honestly don't know who the main character is, yet you're given control of him. Without any background information, do you really care about him? The way the characters were established in this game, I honestly didn't care for them...at least, in the beginning. Until you dive deeper into the quest to find out who these people are, it felt like the designers just said, ~Here, take control. It doesn't matter who they are, we just wrote them into the game.~ If I were to play this as a casual gamer, I would be completely disinterested with the game the first two hours of the game. But because I had to see how this game compared to the other RPGs, I pressed on  the game is boring and slow at the beginning, but the story does pick up further into the game. But in all honesty, there's no incentive to keep playing. If this were a novel, I would have given up by the second chapter -- even if the good stuff happens a hundred pages deeper into the book.So yes, Shadow Madness is enjoyable, but not right off the bat. You have to give it a few chapters to get to the good stuff.", "date": "Jun 8, 1999"}
