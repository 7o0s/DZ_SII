You think a regular console controller is inaccurate compared to the venerable mouse and keyboard combo? Imagine trying to score a headshot with a thumb-pad and a collection of number keys. So developer MachineWorks Northwest deserves some serious kudos for chipping away at the control barrier that prevents mobile from hosting a really good FPS -- Duke Nukem Arena 3D is a very playable shooter for the smallest screen.   But manageable controls are only part of the reason MachineWorks deserves praise. Duke Nukem Arena 3D is a full-featured online multiplayer game, capable of hosting real-time, non-lagging deathmatch sessions for up to four players. Players need not develop some crazy profile and then suffer the headaches of navigating an online portal. Within twenty seconds and just a few clicks, players will be roaming one of ten mobile-specific areas and trading bullets with other Dukes and Pigcops. It really is an achievement, allowing MachineWorks to drive a stake in the mobile landscape and claim some pretty exclusive territory for themselves.   Duke Nukem Arena 3D is broken into three separate games. There is a single-player game, the original Duke Nukem Mobile 3D that MachineWorks released last year. This is a 21-stage action game with scalable difficulty. It's a good enough value on its own but MachineWorks adds greater value by including a survival mode called Nukem Dead that pits the gruff anti-hero against wave after wave of alien enemies. The longer you stay alive, the more points you can throw on to an online leaderboard for bragging rights.   However, the real selling point of Duke Nukem Arena 3D is definitely the online multiplayer, which has run flawlessly since the game went live on Verizon Wireless earlier this week. I cannot stress enough how easy it was to get online and find a match. Hosting is also incredibly easy -- there is nothing to set-up other than which map you want (all are pretty good, but the bridge-filled map was a favorite) and then wait for at least one player to join. As mentioned, there is no lag. I have tried to game with complete strangers as well as side-by-side with another player and the timing was pretty amazing.   As mentioned earlier, the controls are the best I can imagine for a mobile FPS -- but that's not to say they are perfect. I have played the game now on a number of handsets and the one that seemed the most natural was the LG VX9900 (EnV). The VX8600 was pretty good, but I still had some trouble managing the looking up and down (assigned to 1 and 3) while moving and shooting. I found myself doing a lot of stopping and starting on the 8600, while I was smoothly strafing around pillars with the 9900. But what a game like Duke Nukem Arena 3D really underlines is the need for handset manufacturers to offer better control inputs for gaming and other applications.   Duke Nukem Arena 3D looks really solid -- but not as good as MachineWorks' upcoming Prey Mobile (ZOMG). The texture work is very nice with only a little warping. The frame rate is smooth with no hiccups. The player models are pretty good, although up close they get a little blocky. The game features excellent digitized speech and sound effects, plus some quality musical cues. Overall, it's a really strong production.  MachineWorks Northwest is both delivering the goods for hardcore gamers that may have written off mobile as well as showing current mobile gamers that there's more than casual out there. That's no slam against casual games -- I love 'em -- but sometimes you need a little adrenaline. The online stuff in Duke Nukem Arena 3D is incredibly smart and well-constructed; it's just so easy to set-up or find a match.The issue with any FPS, though, is control. So, if the actual hardware design itself gets in the way of entirely smooth play, should the game itself be penalized? I'll agree that the first-person shooter isn't the best genre for mobile, but this is the best effort thus far. If you don't think you can get around the controls, then don't download the game -- plain and simple. What a game like Duke Nukem Arena 3D really underlines is the need for handset manufacturers to offer better control inputs for gaming and other applications.MachineWorks has done a remarkable job here with what they have, so if you're tired of matching jewels and have a V CAST handset on Verizon Wireless, get your Duke on.", "date": "Jun 15, 2007"}
