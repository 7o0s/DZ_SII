What's weird is that a decreasing amount of good shooters -- once the core staple of PlayStation games -- are landing in PlayStation's waters. By year's end we'll be so overwhelmed by licensed games and sequels that any game, even remotely innovative, could wow us. So it's no wonder that Bandai's Silent Bomber is such a surprisingly fresh game. Who would have though that a rather tired anime ~shooter~ like this could have made us so happy?   Gameplay Silent Bomber is a classic old-school shooter with a twist. You don't necessarily shoot so much as you target enemies and bomb the be-Jesus out of them. Armed with a giant bomb-blaster strapped around each forearm, your silvery-blue hair-pushed forward, angst-ridden hero, Jutah, is armed to the teeth ready to blow up whatever stands in his way. And boy does he. Everything in Silent Bomber is destructible -- flying druids, robots, all sorts of generators, silos, bosses, walls, towers, gates -- all ready for you to blow their tops.   By pressing and holding the Square button, you project a target cone that, once an enemy is squarely in its range, locks onto the enemy. You can lay a single bomb, or multiple bombs, for bigger, more powerful bosses. As you progress through the game, the number of bombs increases, from two to four to six, eight, etc. So, laying a long line of bombs or stacking them on an enemy gets pretty easy, and very dangerous for both you and the enemies. You can injure yourself with the bombs, if you're in the way.   The heart of the game is a combination of platformer and shooter, sort of like Contra or even Apocalypse, only in full 3D, and with super sci-fi anime characters. Each level consists of a horde of baddies, lots of blinking stuff to blow up, and the end-boss of each level, who is beatable once you learn his or her pattern. Why is this refreshing? First of all, it's a cleanly designed game. It's cleverly designed so that the bomb targeting and laying is actually quite unique and slightly more complex than your average shooter. And what's cool is that you play it much the way you would a platformer. When was the last time the PlayStation had a unique shooter on its hands?   The story behind Jutah and his team is vague and not even necessary. You must blow up the enemy ship and continue to do so until the enemy perishes. How's that for the short-and-dirty story? Perhaps what's best about the story is the stereotypical anime cast of characters. You've got your constantly moping jester type who's not terribly attractive, a hot and sexy babe in combat gear, the clean-dutiful female commander, secretly in love with Jutah, and Jutah's the sly-eyed nemesis, who is clearly a bad guy in disguise.    None of these folks really matter because if you never heard one word of the story, or never even once listened to the objectives, you would still be able to play the entire game through without a hitch. But the cut-scenes simply play into the anime stereotypes so well, it's hard not to resist poking fun at them.   Jutah, the Silent Bomber himself, is also a real card.  He has no sense of humor. None. He's a loner. Your classic silent, but er, deadly type, only he's bent on destroying everything possible because of his wretched despair and tireless self pity. You see a long time ago he blew up a city filled with innocent civilians. And he's never forgiven himself since. Sniff, sniff...  Believe it or not, Silent Bomber has a two-player mode. You and a buddy can team up and pick from several of the enemies and bosses against whom you have fought and defeated. Pitted in a 3D ring-like arena, you must out-blast or outsmart your opponent, using a blend of defense tactics and timely attacks. It's a simple death-match, and nothing more, but it does add a little extra that many developers simply skip, and it's definitely worth checking into.   Graphics What's noticeable from the start is that the in-game graphics are quite good and the cut-scenes suck big-time. The CG cut-scenes are slow and the characters totally unrealistic looking. They look like a collection of geometric shapes with well-placed eyes, rather than people. As I was saying before, the characters are laughably formulaic and their dialog is even worse. It's actually so sad they're simply fun to watch and listen to for pure enjoyment.   Jutah himself, as with most of the human characters in the game proper, is quite small. The enemies are different; they don't suffer from little-people syndrome. The well-thought out net result is great because no matter how many explosions you ignite, or how many enemies are on screen -- and sometimes as many as 10 on are on at once -- there is no slowdown. Jutah is tiny, but he still holds some detail. You can see his funny silver-blue hair, and his forearm bomb-things look very unique.   The levels as are all well textured, and each new hull and level of the ship looks slightly different than the previous one. The fires and explosions look decent, but don't quite up the level of realism. Most of the bosses are quite large, and they're well detailed, with lots of little mechanical parts, illuminated with a good mix of bright and dark colors, and futuristic robotic design. It's not so much the graphics that are interesting, but rather it's the levels and boss designs, entrenched in the robot/insect mold and embellished with space decor, that brings out of our own world and into far-out sci-fi one. Yes, it's been done before, but Silent Bomber is quite impressive in its own familiar way.     Sound This game is about blowing stuff up, so you essentially hear two kinds of things, explosions and people talking. The voice acting is stilted and obvious in its delivery. The voices themselves are OK, but perhaps the best of them all, is the mad, revenge-bent, destruction-monger himself. Mr. Silent Bomber, who sounds wonderfully sultry and indifferent with every word he speaks.   The music doesn't get in the way, and I when realized that I hadn't remembered any of it, it meant two things. One, the music wasn't memorable, and two, it felt nearly perfect, keeping me focused on the gameplay and bent on havoc!Silent Bomber is at the very least a rental, if not a straight out purchase. The clever twist on the shooter/action Contra style game is simple and yet just short of genius. Using bombs to blow up everything, and with a simple timer, is so good fun. Silent Bomber plays just like an arcade game, too. It's got that, ~Oh, I'll drop in just one more quarter~ mentality, making it difficult to stop playing after one level. No real thinking involved, just pattern-based bombing and destroying the heck out of things. Classic gaming indeed. One last note: The game appears to be only 14 levels, although the manual says it's actually 26. We haven't figured out where those extra 12 are. So, as a slight disclaimer, we finished the game in 14 levels, which is short. But if there are indeed 12 more levels, the game should very well be long enough for a straight purchase. (Just have to figure out where those secret levels are hiding...)", "date": "Apr 20, 2000"}
