This never got much further than spraying down my sister as if she was on fire and I needed to put her out, but the thought was there. Even today, there's a firefighter training ground near my house and I see future heroes in training all the time. To help understand what it's like to be in their shoes, Konami's Firefighter F.D. 18 pits you against a serious amount of fire and your skills with the hose are all you have to save the day. All without spraying your sister.   Firefighter F.D. 18 features Dean McGregor as the main firefighter who ends up fighting a series of fires set by an arsonist. The plot is as hackneyed, if not much more so, than the typical action movie, but the variety of challenges that are in place that must be overcome are what make Firefighter F.D. 18 an interesting challenge. This is not an overly complex game, but it manages to combine some quick hand-eye-hose coordination with strategy elements to make a fun title.    Gameplay  The gameplay Firefighter F.D. 18 is focused on one of two things: rescuing survivors from the flames and killing fire ~bosses~ that are usually at the end of each stage. The player is equipped with only a fire hose, a fire extinguisher, an axe for breaking through walls and boxes, and, later on, a fire cannon that shoots a quick burst of water. There's also the chance to call in for a quick bit of help from a partner and bombs that can be detonated to take the wind out of the fires.   There are three main locations in the game and each one is broken down into several different stages that are different parts of each location such as a different floor. No matter what, the goal is the same: rescue all of the hostages. The hostages provide a time limit for both sections and if a hostage dies, or you die, you'll need to try again. Where the survivor rescue sections are based on exploration and maneuvering quickly through flames, the bosses stick the player in one location until you extinguish the main flame.   In playing through, I was pleasantly surprised at how Konami had managed to make both sections of the game entertaining and especially how the bosses had been given distinct personalities. The survivor rescues are laid out like obstacle courses where there is an occasional branching path to follow. The actual fighting of the fires and working through several rooms full of flames can get a bit tiresome which is where Firefighter F.D. 18 gets bogged down, but there are several situations that present fiery puzzles that need to be solved quickly and liven up the action.    Several obstacles that can get in the way in Firefighter F.D. 18 and they can be on the ground or falling from the ceiling. There are falling I-beams, chunks falling from the ceiling, oil slicks, boxes, and other objects that need to be taken into consideration, but it's the explosives that are really important. One room I encountered had several drums with explosive chemicals in them as well as propane tanks. Getting through unscathed required timing the various explosions and dodging the blasts of fire. With all of the big booms and fireballs, these challenges made all of the firefighting worthwhile.    The boss battles take this explosive legwork and expand upon it with some artistic license. Boiler rooms go crazy, cars shoot across burning parking lots, and one engine room rolls explosive barrels at you, Donkey Kong style. The general technique for each boss is to learn the different patterns of the fire that change as the battle goes on and spraying water at both the core of the fire to put it out and the ground around you so you don't incinerate yourself in the process. The sense of realism drops dramatically during the boss battles, but unless you're a complete purist, this won't bother you.   As the game progressed, I enjoyed the boss battles more than the typical survival rescues. Where the rescues turn into sprints for all the hostages since there's no reward for putting out the fires, fighting the bosses contain the true core of the game where there's a lot of give and take during each battle.     A couple of the biggest drawbacks of Firefighter F.D. 18 involve the control and the camera. When Dean is shooting water at a target, he can walk slowly and keep facing forward. There's also the ability to take a quick step forward, back, left, and right. All of this works well, but running away from a fire or explosion and turning around to shoot water again gets to be a hassle, especially since it makes the camera spin around and make it difficult to figure out what's going on. For most of the time this is not a problem, but with extreme fire situations or boss battles it can be disorienting and deadly.   Another difficulty for the camera is seeing where Dean is shooting the water when the camera is behind him. The right analog stick normally controls the camera, but when shooting water it controls the hose. Face the hose forward and the camera slips behind him so that his body gets in the way. There's no transparency effect for seeing where the water's going which makes the effort of fighting a fire more difficult than it needs to be.   While the initial run through of Firefighter F.D. 18 can take only 6-8 hours, there are three different difficulty settings and the opportunity to stage select once the whole game has been finished. To add to the replayability, medals can be won for best time and several objects are hidden in all of the stages. So even beyond the initial adventure with the weak plot, there is some more challenge for those who want to keep on fighting the fires.   Graphics  The most fascinating aspect of Firefighter F.D. 18 is how the fire moves around the rooms and spreads of its own will. There are plenty of scripted events such as objects falling from the ceiling or explosions, all of the big stuff, but the regular fire is unscripted. Watching the fire move around the room or sneak behind you is both frustrating and amazing and makes the game feel so much better.   The fire is not graphically amazing in its look or style with the most detailed fire textures reserved for explosions or wall fires, but it's the overall effect that makes the experience. Some explosions will shoot across the floor and others will launch balls of fire that can set you on fire. When multiple effects are going on at once, the effect is appropriately hellish.   Sound  Fitting in with the B-movie atmosphere, the voice acting is pretty weak with plenty of overly emotional characters and melodrama. Sure, the situations are pretty extreme, but taking this seriously is a leap of faith. I only wish that the actors had spent more time in the studio to create more voice samples to draw from. Hearing the fire chief giving you the same instructions over and over is tiresome, but it's the survivors' mismatched voices that really take the cake. Half of the survivors sound slightly peeved at the tardiness of your rescue than relieved to be alive.    The soundtrack has plenty of dramatic flourishes that help to back up the action, but it's the sound effects that help carry the game. With plenty of whooshy explosions and static-y water sounds, the sound effects give extra life to the fires that are all around you.Firefighter F.D. 18 is a fun fire-fighting experience that can be a little too linear and repetitive when it comes to the constant blazes. Even so, with such a limited amount that Konami could do with such a title, there's enough variety in the obstacles and the bosses to keep things interesting. The storyline certainly won't keep you going.Even though there's some very interesting bosses and the fire effects are very well done, the short gameplay overall and the limited nature of what Dean is capable of in both equipment and maneuverability prevent this game from becoming much better. It's an interesting effort and wins points for variety and creativity, though.", "date": "Mar 9, 2004"}
