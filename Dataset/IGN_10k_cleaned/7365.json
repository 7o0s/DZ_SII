Then in steps EA Sports' NASCAR Revolution, a game which attempts to capture true NACAR racing action while trying to take the NASCAR license to new heights.  Unfortunately NASCAR Revolution does little more than offer a brief diversion for racers looking for a realistic NASCAR experience and it falls flat compared to other games in the genre.  EA did manage to secure the rights to use some of the top NASCAR drivers on the circuit.  Jeff Gordon, Ricky Rudd, Dale Earnhardt, Terry Labonte, Dick Trickle (my personal favorite ... you know junior high school was a dark period for him) and over 25 more drivers are modeled in the game.  You'll also find racer bios and bios for some of the NASCAR legends, like Richard Petty, who have retired from the racing circuit but who are still influential in the world of NASCAR.  You can opt to jump into a single race for some quick action or test your longevity in full season mode.  There are an impressive number of actual NASCAR tracks (17 in all) and a good number of track options such as pit crew mistakes, replays and night racing which add much needed spice to a game which basically boils down to driving around in a circle 500 times. And, as with most racing simulations, you can customize your car before the race by altering gear ratio, shock percentage, weight distribution, spoiler angle, fuel amount, and tire pressure and type.  Unfortunately, NASCAR Revolution just fails horribly in the control department, something that is quintessential to a good racer.  I fought with Revolution for an hour trying to get it to recognize my Logitech WingMan Formula Force, but I finally gave up in frustration after numerous lock-ups and no success.  I moved on to the keyboard next, but I found the key controls fairly unresponsive and ill suited for the rigors of high speed racing.  I finally opted for a joystick which, although better than the keyboard, did little to make me feel like I was really driving a car.  There's no sense of speed in the game whatsoever and your car handles not like a finely tuned machine, but more like an out-of-control bowling ball.  It's sluggish, it's sloppy and it doesn't take turns well.  Now, I've never actually driven a NASCAR auto at 200mph, but I can only imagine that they don't drive like this.  Revolution comes up short as compared to other NASCAR simulations, like Papyrus' NASCAR 2 for instance.   What does shine in this game are the graphics and NASCAR Revolution really shows off what a good graphics team can do.  The on-track visuals are certainly Revolution's best features. The cars look amazing, complete with highly polished and heavily advertised shells which reflect clouds and other cars as you race around each track.  OK, so this isn't very realistic (the reflecting skins, not the ads ... those cars are 200mph commercials after all), but it sure does look good.  Unfortunately, it looks as if the design team skimped on the rest of the game graphics and the human skins look pitiful as compared to some of EA's other sports licenses, like NBA Live and NHL '99.   What did help get me into the simulation a bit was the voice of the driving spotter.  Just like in a real NASCAR race, you'll have a simulated partner who watches the race and tells you what's happening up ahead.  He'll bark out suggestions like ~stay high~ or ~clear low~ when you're approaching corners.  These tips are generally helpful, especially when there's a wreck up ahead (and there are an inordinately number of crashes in Revolution), but you must still rely heavily on your own reflexes when you're caught in sticky situations.  EA also had the insight to include in-game commentary by Bob Jenkins and NASCAR veteran Benny Parsons.  Although they basically just spouted out NASCAR factoids for most of the race and only updated the status of the race occasionally, their voices were clean and crisp and gave a break to the constant engine drone of so many other racers.  If you run a full field of 43 racers, you'll need a solid system to achieve smooth animation and optimal control of your car. EA recommends a 200+ MHz system and a 3D accelerator is required to play the game. But don't even think about getting Revolution for your P200 if you're looking to compete against a full heat of racers. Even on a PII450 with SLIed Voodoo2s I experienced some annoying slowdown in the larger races.  Everything seemed to even out when I reduced the number of cars on the track, but I would be wary of this racer if you have a slower system regardless of the number of cars in the heat.  In the end, NASCAR Revolution isn't going to satisfy PC racers and it's actually going to piss-off those of you looking for a realistic racing sim.  It falls somewhere between an arcade racer and a sim, not having enough true physics modeling to be realistic but lacking the control that makes a fun arcade experience.  It does have a few nice features, but they're overshadowed by the wonky controls.    -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Mar 19, 1999"}
