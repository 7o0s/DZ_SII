Nintendo's already shown that past Super NES franchises can enjoy success on the handheld format, so it makes sense for Sega to do the same with games from its own 16-bit library. Unfortunately, the first title out of this idea, Sega Smash Pack is a rather clunky compilation, with three not-so-spectacular games from Sega's console past that show their age more than offer a satisfying gaming experience. Features Conversions of three Genesis games: Ecco the Dolphin, Sonic Spinball, Golden Axe Link cable support in Golden Axe Password save in Ecco the Dolphin Only for Game Boy Advance  Codefire, the small Southern California-based game developer responsible for the Dreamcast edition of Sega Smash Pack, was put to the task of bringing a compilation pack of classic Genesis games to the Game Boy Advance. For the project, three games were selected: the classic fantasy beat-em-up, Golden Axe, the unique adventure title Ecco the Dolphin, and the awkward-but-fun pinball game starring Sega's mascot, Sonic Spinball. Emulating the Genesis on the Game Boy Advance hardware was probably out of the question -- the GBA's a powerful piece of kit, but it doesn't have quite the horsepower required to pull off the calculations of emulating another 16-bit system. So, Codefire went the other route: utilize the original game's art and sound assets while programming like the dickens to get the conversion to play as accurately as it did on the Genesis.  If the team was given ample time, or if they put enough man-power behind the project, the compilation pack could, logically, be done near flawlessly. Desert Strike Advance developer Budcat proved that Genesis-to-GBA ports could be handled quite successfully. But in the case of Sega Smash Pack, the three games aren't flawless...in a couple of cases, the ports are far from Genesis-accurate. Each of the games certainly has its own level of fun and challenge, but if you're looking for accuracy in getting the Genesis experience on the handheld, it didn't happen in Sega Smash Pack. Ecco the Dolphin is the best of the batch because of its originality, and the conversion was pulled off pretty well. In the game, you control Ecco, a frolicking dolphin who has just lost his family. By traversing the dangerous waters you must explore caverns, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies by doing the standard dolphin abilities. On the Game Boy Advance, the game is fast and smooth, and it's not an easy game to complete. Like the Genesis game, every completed level offers a short password to jot down so you can get back to that area after you've shut down the system. The game is also the prettiest of the three games on the pack, mainly because it's a later-generation Genesis title. What the conversion lacks is the original game's fantastic (for Genesis standards) soundtrack...in its place, you'll hear a looping 30-second audio clip that will get old, really quick. On the whole, Ecco is a decent adventure with the same weird controls and collision detection that plagued the original design on the 16-bit system. It also has issues because of resolution; the scrolling can't keep up with Ecco's fast movements, giving the game a somewhat ~crowded~ feel since the levels feel cropped due to the GBA's lower-resolution screen. It's a unique adventure, though, and definitely welcome in any Sega compilation pack. Golden Axe was always an arcade favorite, but the game didn't fare to well on the Genesis when it was ported to that system...mark that down to first-generation issues. A flawed port becomes even worse on the Game Boy Advance, as Golden Axe in Sega Smash Pack is the definite dud of the bunch. In the game, you choose from three different warriors and take him or her through eight levels of dangerous, fantasy-based locations, beating up skeletons, thieves, and evil knights...until the final battle with Death Adder. It's essentially Double Dragon with real dragons...and the problem with this port: no support for two players during the adventure. That was half the fun of the original, and its omission just calls attention to itself...especially when the developer compromised with a lame head-to-head link-cable mini-game. The port uses all of the Genesis art assets, but the backgrounds don't have the original game's life...rivers don't flow, the gigantic eagle doesn't fly, and skies are even the wrong color. The clunky Genesis gameplay is a bit worse on the GBA, with easily-exploited moves that can take out enemies with a bit of persistent repetition. On the flipside, the enemies can get in some seriously unfair attacks that were obviously meant for two-player cooperation to combat.  Finally, we've got Sonic Spinball. I'm convinced that THQ wanted to slap Sega's mascot on the box to sell the game, but it's a shame that the company couldn't provide a better game to capitalize on the hedgehog's success. Not that the game's a bad one, it isn't; it's just that Sonic Spinball was a bit on the awkward side in its design. Sega's internal Sega Technical Institute team pretty much took the idea from the original Sonic the Hedgehog's Casino Zone and spun it off into its own game. The result was a strange mix of Pinball with platform elements, instead of the other way around. The game's animation and speed were a lot clunkier than the hedgehog's platform adventure, but it was a solid effort. On the Game Boy Advance, the conversion is really close to the Genesis version...right down to the game's strangely animated introduction as well as its crappy FM soundtrack. There's a lot to explore in this pinball title, but because of its focus on how much you can score in a game, a cartridge save for this title alone would have improved the game's enjoyment.  These three games are wrapped together in an extremely weak, unimaginitive menu system, which very disappointing considering the Genesis games are below the graphical standards of what's expected on the GBA. The developer could have definitely spiced-up the package with a somewhat glitzy front-end that showed they could do more than simply port code over from one system to another. It also takes literally thirty seconds to actually get to this lame menu since the design forces you through six layers of annoying corporate legal screens. Lesson to be learned here: don't annoy the gamer before letting them play your game. At least you can jump out of one game into another pretty quickly by a simple button combination. I suppose you have to cut a little slack for the one individual programmer that was given the daunting task of porting three Genesis games to the distinctly different Game Boy Advance hardware. But only a little. It's obvious that this package needed to spend a little bit more time in the oven. It seems like Sonic Spinball's the only game that gets through the porting process nearly unscathed, but because the original Genesis game wasn't exactly a top-notch Sega offering back in the day, the GBA port doesn't exactly sell Sega Smash Pack on its own merits. Golden Axe is even sloppier on the GBA than it was on the Genesis, with easy-to-exploit gameplay issues as well as completely unfair enemy attacks. Ecco the Dolphin's probably the strongest game in the trio, since it's still a very unique adventure even to today's standards. But as an entire package, Sega Smash Pack is a letdown, especially in its presentation.", "date": "Oct 11, 2002"}
