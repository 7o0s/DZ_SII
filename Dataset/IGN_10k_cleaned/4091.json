Needless to say, the soundtrack to the new Celebrity Deathmatch game from Gotham Games is all about the hard rock, with a few select, extra amped-up rap jams tossed in for extra fist waving goodness. Glancing at the track listing with a sharper eye, the astute observer will notice that the album is literally broken into thirds. The first part of the album is all about the hard rock, then it segues into more straight ahead, almost indie/alt rock terrain, before finally tapering off with several blasts of fist waving rap raucous.   Things jump off with the bizarre arena rock ballad-meets-angst ridden metal vibe of Sevendust's ~Enemy,~ a track that presents a warm fuzzy take on post-millennial hard rock. The band rails with turgid rhythmic interplay throughout the bulk of the song, but then Lajon Witherspoon dips into a very mid-80s sounding arena rock balladeer mode for the chorus. It's as if Journey has collided with nu death metal, the result being a hard rock song with a serious personality disorder.   Nothingface serve up the cryptically titled ~Murder Is Masturbation,~ which is a rippling slab of molten surge that flows between subdued, angst ridden vocals and growling scream therapy ominousity. The track starts out somewhat mellow then builds up to chugging thunder and swirling aggression.    Los Angeles bred Closure shift the focus from anger management to more straight forward rock hi-jinks with ~Afterglow,~ a track that revels in power chord intensity, restrained riffage, and anthemic vocals. It's the type of epic rock that fits in with the likes of Creed, Collective Soul, and other guitar driven power rock outfits.    The Kicks deliver ~Mir,~ a song that begins with radio dial noise, static, and chiming guitars. It's a pop punk blitzkrieg complete with whining vocals, snappy rhythm backbeats, and punchy bass volleying with equally punching guitars. Think Blink-182, All-American Rejects, and other like-minded outfits and you're in the same ball park. It's peppy, to say the least.    The first of five preview tracks (i.e. music from a forthcoming album) comes in the form of ~Fastcar~ from Blue Epic. A somewhat more roots oriented, classic rock inflected song, it's driven by solid guitar crunch, impassioned vocals, and pounding drum work.  Default continue the generic rock mantra with ~Taking My Life Away,~ a track from their upcoming album. It falls into the Creed vein of impassioned rock, searing guitars wrapped around excessively emotive vocals. And Pay The Girl conclude the rock portion of the album by contributing another paint-by-numbers rock song in the form of ~So Without,~ as crunching guitars boil over neo-raspy vocals and a mid-80s stadium rock guitar solo that almost raises the ghosts of hair bands long forgotten.   As the last notes of Pay The Girl's rock fade into memory, the kings of crunk infected rap, Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz kick out the jams with their dirty, gritty brand of fist waving rap shenanigans on ~Get Low.~ The tracks adds the crazy antics of The Yin Yang Twins to create a grating, slow tempo chunk of crunk.    The pimp slap boom bap continues with The Yin Yang Twin's ~Salt Shaker,~ which sees Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz returning the favor by guesting on the track. It suspiciously sounds a lot like the previous cut (thanks mostly to the vocal growl of Jon and company), making it sort of a sequel or companion rap piece, if you will.    New femme fatale MC and Lil Jon protg Chyna Whyte unveils ~Gangsta Sh*t,~ a track from her upcoming release. An interpolation of the classic ~Funky Worm~ synth squiggle leads you into her gruff-n-ruff vocal rant. The track reverberates with a sense of thuggish unease, the raspy vocals contrasting with the squeaky synth groove to create an eerily disarming and very gritty rap entry.   Snoop Dogg's homies, The Eastsidaz, drop some seriously fonkay West Coast flavor, bringing along WC OG fools like Kokane and Suga Free to enhance ~Rug Burnz,~ a new joint off their upcoming album. A bugged out Middle Eastern string twinge provides the stripped down aural background as the duo rap about getting' down-n-dirty during sex. Easily the best track on the album. Period.   The album ends on an upbeat note with ~Dirty Dragon~ from Oobie. Once again featuring the ubiquitous Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz, the track is a cool blast of PoMo urban bliss, the luscious sounding ladies of Oobie crooning something sensuous while Lil Jon and crew toss in some bugged out, gravel voiced hype. Easily the second best track on the album. Period.   Overall the 12 tracks that make up the Celebrity Deathmatch soundtrack suffer from what can only be classified as a generic routineness. That is to say, while every song is tight in its own right and well produced, the music on a whole sounds like the shadow version of songs done by other more popular and well-known acts within the genres of rap, nu metal, and swelling, emotive rock.    In the end there really aren't many songs that stand out and warrant repeated listening. Yet as background music while you're pummeling your favorite celebrities during game play, it's fair, if a bit innocuous. The thing that sticks with me the most, however, is why the music of the game's participants--Tommy Lee, Marilyn Manson, the members of *NSYNC, and Busta Rhymesdidn't find its way onto the soundtrack (Conversely, why aren't Snoop, Lil Jon, or Sevendust included in the game as characters?) Now that would have made for a great soundtrack, don'tcha think?", "date": "Oct 30, 2003"}
