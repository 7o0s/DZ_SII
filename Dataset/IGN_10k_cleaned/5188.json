Even More Lemmings are back for more old-school gameplaying.   The collected Lemmings titles are here for your PlayStation, and they're just as you remembered them. The gameplay is addictive and ingenious, and hasn't lost a bit of its charm (unless you played through it too many times back in the day).   For those who aren't aware of what Lemmings are, here's a brief explanation. Lemmings are small ~folk~ with green-hair who do what they're directed to do; they walk in whichever direction you point them to; they perform tasks you tell them to; and they die if you direct them to. Lemmings, in essence, only do what they're told -- the very basis of the game. It's up to you to take them to their base before they die.   Therein lies the task. The levels are designed to confuse, obstruct, and trip you up. Thankfully, Lemmings are evolved creatures, relatively speaking of course. They have diversified abilities, or tasks. These tasks range, and different levels require various strategy use of these abilities. You're given a list of Lemmings including Bombers, Builders, Bashers, Floaters, and a litany of others. The real trick is to use the right task for the right obstacle, and with accurate timing. In some cases, you might use as many as five or six different tasks to complete the mission.   Since the game contains two previously released titles, the amount of levels reaches into three figures. There are hours and hours of gameplay to be had here. A normal Lemmings go-round usually lasts either only 15 minutes (a mild mental exercise), or about six hours, miminum. It's rare that anyone can actually pull himself or herself away for any shorter time.What can I say? This collection of Lemmings is great in that it's the old games, unaltered, chirpy, fun, and as engaging as ever. If it ain't broke...My only criticism is that Psygnosis didn't actually get down to business creating brand new levels. I'm pretty sure that Psygnosis just wanted newer gamers to but this one, and hopefully a handful of hardcore types who wanted to own them on their PlayStation.", "date": "Oct 23, 1998"}
