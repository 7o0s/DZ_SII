Mr. Fisher, the star of the popular Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series has quickly become one of the coolest characters to hit the stealth espionage scene since the game's original debut on PC and home consoles back in winter of 2002. Over a year later, this critically acclaimed adventure has found its way to the Nokia N-Gage, allowing portable gaming fans the luxury of experiencing its fun blend of stealth action, and gadget-driven gameplay while on the go. But does Sam still pack a powerful punch on the small-screen, or are his exploits better suited to home consoles? Read on to find out.  Features Fun mix of stealth and action Wealth of cool gadgets and weapons Excellent level variety Great co-op multiplayer modes Based on the story of the popular home-console Splinter Cell   Those already familiar with the home console versions of Splinter Cell probably realize that regardless of the advanced capabilities of the N-Gage, it just isn't advanced enough to do the game justice in 3D. So, what the developers at Ubi Soft have done is redesign the game--based on the story of the originalin good old-fashioned side-scrolling 2D. While some of the game's stealth elements have been lost in the dimensional down-sizing, it remains a fun action game.  Each black-ops mission will take you to interesting and exciting locations such as the CIA, the Defense Ministry or a Caspian oil refinery. Gameplay and mission objects also offer an excellent level of variety; you will find yourself sneaking past ominous surveillance cameras and guards to obtain secret documents, scaling your way down the broken pipes and deathly passages of a burning building, or picking off countless enemies with the aid of a sniper rifle. The abundance of mission styles will hold your interest and keep the gameplay feeling fresh.  While there are a lot of fun things to do in Splinter Cell, there are still a considerable amount of annoyances. The N-Gage's cropped field of vision will have you pulling your hair out from time to time, especially in levels where stealth is key. Half of the time we found ourselves leisurely strolling out in front of a security camera or guard just because it popped into view a second too late. There is a cool ~sticky camera~ feature to help with this problemholding the four button allows you to extend the camera's vision up, down, left and rightbut this can become tedious when you must rely on it every five seconds.  Another issue we had is the game's trial-and-error nature. Often times you are put in a situation where death, or a lucky guess are your only options. In a later puzzle you must jam the gears of a sentry machine gun without any advice from your usually chatty mission advisor, and only after resorting to button mashing did we manage to stop it from blowing up in out face for a second time. Luckily, you can send old Sam Fisher to his grave as many times as you need and continue fairly close to where you left off. You have an unlimited amount of continues at your disposal, and the only real consequence to dying prematurely is occasionally restarting in an awkward arealike directly in front of a guard.  Surprisingly, there are a couple really entertaining multiplayer modes where two players can team up in about ten different missions. In Team Play mode, you and a friend can play through a series of missions together, solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles that would be impossible alone. Players can work together simply by boosting each other up to otherwise unreachable heights, or strategically plan a simultaneous assault on a group of enemies. The co-op missions are nicely designed and satisfying to figure out with a friend. Sniper mode is also a cool, but more simplistic two-player game where friends can team up to wipe out a slew of enemies with sniper rifles.  Splinter Cell sports basic 2D visuals that wont blow you away or leave you disappointed, they just get the job done. Character sprites look like relics from the 16-bit days, and have limited animations. And while environments have a static feel to them, they do succeed in creating a unique setting from mission to mission. Where Splinter Cell slouches in the graphics department, it does a commendable job in creating a enjoyable experience for the ears. The soundtrack is suitable for the game's gritty military theme, drumming out confident marches and ambient sneaking sounds, and effects are also of high quality, enhancing the experience. Translating the excitement of stealth action to a two-dimensional setting is an ambitious task, and Splinter Cell does a solid job for the most part. It can be quite frustrating at times with its trial-and-error gameplay and the N-Gage's stifling screen-size, but where it really shines is in its ever-changing gameplay and great multiplayer modes.", "date": "Jan 10, 2004"}
