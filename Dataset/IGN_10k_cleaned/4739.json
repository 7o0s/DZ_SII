And with both come superlative popcorn entertainment, and mind-numbing banality. Which side of the fence will the upcoming ~Around the World in 80 Days~ movie is to be determined, but the cellphone game based on it is now a known quantity.   And we think we preferred blissful ignorance.   Features:   Play as Jackie Chan  Four locations: Paris, China, India, and New York  Protect the Jade Buddha while fighting off thugs   Around the World in 80 Days plays like a classic SNES movie game -- basic side-scroller formula that plugs in movie characters and set pieces. Remember those old Ocean games, like The Shadow? Repetitive action stages that unspooled over and over, switching out marginally different enemy sprites until you wanted to weep for your lost forty bucks?   At least Around the World in 80 Days will only set you back a few dollars instead, as you slip into the shoes of the Jackie Chan character. As Chan, you must fight a horde of faceless thugs in Paris and India, working to reach China where a priceless artifact must be returned to your village. Once the goods have been delivered, you must finish off the bad guys in New York.   Now, you don't always have to confront these thugs face-on. You can sometimes gab hold of a hot air balloon and float above the city streets. If you can swing this tactic, go for it, because every time an enemy troop assaults you, you drop said priceless artifact, the Jade Buddha. You then need to pick it up before you can continue.   The problem with Around the World in 80 Days is, well, it's not very much fun. The action is tiresome and repetitive, smacking bad guys around against different backdrops. At least you're offered invincibility, Power of Ten Tigers, once you pick up a Tiger Coin. Iffy control lends itself to the morass -- you move slowly and attack with very, very contained ferocity.   The game itself looks okay, close to the original Splinter Cell on non-3650 handsets, just a little less detail. The only way you know you're playing as Jackie Chan is because the instructions say so. Audio-wise, there's a little noise here, but nothing terribly exciting.Pick Up and Play probably did the most they could with what I'm sure was limited time and resources. Around the World in 80 Days isn't even close to being the worse movie game on cellphones, but it's a far shot from the best. Average to the core, and likely not worth your download dollars.", "date": "Jun 3, 2004"}
