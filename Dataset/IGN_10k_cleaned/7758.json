After proving to be one of the most enjoyable launch titles available way back when the GameCube first launched, SEGA's ball-bound simians are back to lend a helping hand this Friday when Nintendo's Wii finally hits UK shelves. Four and half years is a long time in the heady world of videogames though - particularly if you're in an oxygen-starved plastic bubble - so, have those perky primates still got what it takes to kick-start a new console?    Cast your mind back to the original Super Monkey Ball and, indeed, its sequel. The series' formula of fiendish single-player platform-tilting puzzles and rampant multi-player party games remains firmly in tact for SEGA's newest Wii iteration. Starting with the single-player then, Banana Blitz features roughly one hundred levels, each requiring you to guide your titular monkey ball from one end of a hazardous maze to the finishing post.   If you've never played a Monkey Ball game before, the literal twist is that rather than controlling your primate pal directly, you manipulate the angle of the platform it's on. Tilting the ground causes your ball to roll in that direction, with speed increasing the more you tip. While it's all fairly straightforward in concept, the catch is that the further you proceed into the game, the more complicated levels become. Instead of guiding your monkey across flat surfaces, you'll need to navigate chasms, swings, sharp turns, razor-like ledges and more. If it can impede your progress, it's in there - and believe us when we say Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz features level design so utterly genius in its scope for evil, you'll be thankful your remote comes with a strap to keep it attached to your arms.     Obviously, as a Wii launch title, SEGA's pulled out all the stops to support Nintendo's crazy new control system. Unlike previous Monkey Ball games, which relied on the analogue stick to manoeuvre through levels, Banana Blitz utilises the Wii remote's tilt-sensitivity. Put simply (because it is really, really simple), the remote operates as an extension of the platform on-screen - as you tip the controller left, right, forward and back, the level does exactly the same thing. It's hard to quantify just how brilliantly this works too. Guiding your little friend-in-a-ball around is such a beautifully fluid, natural endeavour, you'll wonder how you ever got by without the remote in the first place.   New to the traditional Monkey Ball mix is your simian's ability to jump on demand. By hitting the A button, the little critter will - completely defying the laws of physics, as far as we can tell - leap a couple of feet in the air. It's a simple addition but has a far-reaching effect on the game as you progress. Rather than tossing the feature in for novelty value, SEGA has designed many of the later levels around your new ability. You'll find all manner of steps and chasms to navigate, the upshot being that Banana Blitz features some of the most teeth-grindingly difficult stages in the series. Rest assured though, unlike Super Monkey Ball 2, which was tough thanks to its ludicrously haphazard spring-board mechanics, SEGA's Wii iteration is always fair in its objectives. Much like the original game, it's skill that you'll need to get to the end, not luck.     Of course, for all the game's single-player brilliance, the series has always - arguably - been better remembered for its selection of bonus multiplayer party games. If you've never whiled away the nights with a bunch of friends playing Monkey Fight, Monkey Target or any of the original's classics, then you've never lived. Fans of the series will undoubtedly remember some of SEGA's controversial tinkering when Monkey Ball's sequel came around, adding a couple of under-nourished sports-based games, as well as over-complicating some old favourites. Sadly, it seems that SEGA still hasn't learned that sometimes less is more.   Banana Blitz features 50 largely brand new party games, all utilising the Wii's unique control system in some form or other, whether that's with the remote on its own or alongside the nunchuck. Unfortunately, far too many of them are absolute, unspeakable stinkers. Thankfully, series veterans will find a few of the games they know and love here, with Monkey Golf and Monkey Target surviving the Wii-ifying process relatively unscathed - the former actually managing to be a lot of fun, even surpassing Nintendo's own Wii Sports Golf thanks to less finicky controls. We're still big fans of Target too, although purists mightn't approve of the new tilt-based flight mechanics. Likewise, Monkey Racing - using the remote in horizontal position, much like Excite Truck - and Monkey Bowling make excellent use of Nintendo's waggly wand and prove to be just as much fun as their previous incarnations. Somewhat surprisingly too, Monkey Wars - culled from the largely execrable Super Monkey Ball DS - offers a simplistic, yet undeniably entertaining FPS experience.    Elsewhere, there're a couple of mildly diverting mini-games, including Monkey Hurdle and Simon Says. However, pretty much everything else falls foul of either inexcusable tedium (Paper Sumo Fighter, for example, requiring little more than random flapping and Jigsaw Puzzle, which is every bit as dull as it sounds) or utterly convoluted controls. It seems that in many cases, SEGA has gotten so carried away with shoehorning the remote and nunchuck into the party games, it's not really considered whether they're still playable at the end. Many of the vehicle-based games, for instance, require such a baffling combination of peripheral-waving you're likely going to spend most of your time whizzing around in circles or accidentally beating your team-mates in the face.  Even the potentially brilliant Rock-Paper-Scissors Attack suffers thanks to its ridiculously complicated button-pressing and remote-hoisting requirements.Ultimately though, you're still left with around ten decent party games, with the rest best thought of as particularly brittle icing on an otherwise delicious cake. If you're the type of person who's joined the Monkey Ball series primarily through its frenzied multiplayer action, you might be disappointed with SEGA's latest offering. However, if you've previously spent sleepless nights and countless hours fighting through the franchise's excellent single-player puzzles, Banana Blitz features some of the purest, most satisfying level design yet seen in the series. What's more, the Wii's remote is such a natural fit for the game's basic mechanics, Banana Blitz ends up being the most enjoyable, addictive entry in the series yet.", "date": "Dec 6, 2006"}
