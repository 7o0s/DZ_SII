Vivendi's Bourne Ultimatum, inspired by film based on the Robert Ludlum books and starring Matt Damon, does nothing to repair the category's ailing rep.   You are the spy with a serious memory problem, seeking out the true nature of your identity with determination that far outweighs the ability of the United States government to stop you. You are something of a globe-trotter, too, as you'll visit exotic locations such as Russia, Tangiers and London. This being a movie-based game, I'm hesitant to reveal much about the plot because I prefer not to traffic in spoilers. (So, if I trail off about end-game elements, this is why.)   Bourne is a strict 2-D side-scrolling action game, but it lacks excitement. You spend the majority of the game jamming on the right direction button to run across the screen. Your spy is supposedly in possession of some incredible acrobatic moves, but you're limited to basic jumps and combat moves, such as rolling attacks. The roll is good for covering short distances quickly, such as ducking under gunfire and popping up right in front of an enemy agent. You can lift enemies by pressing up, but I found it much easier just to rely on basic punches for hand-to-hand combat. Bourne can also roll barrels across the screen to get bad guys.   You have a few weapons to pick up and use during your mission, such as pistols and rifles. Grabbing them -- and health packs -- is a bit tricky, as you must stand directly over the item and press down. In a gunfight, this is not fun, because mobile Bourne doesn't have lightning reflexes. When you duck or roll, you have to physically press another button to stand back up and that affects pacing. While futzing with controls, you'll inevitably get shot. Repeatedly. You also ride a motorcycle in the game, shooting up enemies as they speed up and pass by.   Level design is basic. After the first few levels, I was worried that Bourne didn't ever think vertically -- you simply ran from left to right, punching or hitting enemies. Eventually, you do reach stages with multiple planes, but then you're only running right on another stretch of flat flooring. The only thing I did think was clever was the sniper attack. When you see the red laser pinpoints, you need to duck into a room and hide. There are also motorcycle chases where you steer around the screen and take shots at enemies, but otherwise, it's a fairly boring slog around the world.   It's this slow pacing and bland design that undermines Bourne Ultimatum. At no point does the game aspire to be anything more than a paint-by-number side-scroller. Gameloft has this genre down to a science (maybe a bit too much), infusing it with cinematic moments, great art, and some neat moves. Bourne has none of these. The game is plain to the core and when there are better titles on the deck at the same price, it's impossible to be content with something mediocre. Where are the super-cool moves? The really flashy locations? The glints of personality?Featuring lackluster game play, uninteresting art, and no access to actor likeness, this mobile Bourne leaves me with nothing to recommend.
