And now, Sega Enterprises has released All Japan Pro Wrestling Featuring Virtua (that's quite a mouthful) to celebrate that league's 25 year anniversary.The game's developers actually recruited members of the All Japan Pro Wrestling league for accurate motion-capturing and 3D modeling. These guys aren't as flamboyant as the animated members of the WWF, but they get the same job done -- wowing the crowd with their outrageous maneuvers.You should see some of the things you can make these guys do, like back-breakers, bodyslams, grapples, pile-drivers, and sleeper-holds, just to name a few. Heck, you can even plop your opponent on the turnbuckle and throw them off. Cool stuff.But to perform these moves, you'll need to know how to do them. If you resort to maniacal pad-mashing like other wrestling games, you'll never win. That's where the excellent training mode comes in. If a certain move needs multiple controller presses, the screen will prompt you when you have to do it. Granted, these indicators don't show up in a regular match, but they'll give you a good idea how to time your controller motions in your bouts.And yes, if you have no experience with the Japanese language, you'll need to do a little trial-and-error work. The text occurs prominently in the character creation mode where you're asked multiple choice questions that will determine your custom character's performance. Questions like, ~After winning a match, how do you react?~ or ~If someone tells you that your stamina is low, what do you do?~ are in Japanese, so prepare to try random answers if you haven't a clue what they're asking. While it would be awesome if Sega of America picked up this title for a US release, more than likely this game's staying in the land of the rising sun.There are too many Japanese references in this game that wouldn't easily translate, and it would be an immense task to change the game to feature wrestlers from a more American league like the WWF or WCW. But as long as there's a wrestling community making noise, it's not out of the question yet. All Japan Pro Wrestling Featuring Virtua is probably one of the best wrestlers that's hit the Saturn -- and that includes Hudson's cool Fire Pro Wrestling.The game is a little on the sluggish side, but the it has the impact. Especially when you can pit Virtua Fighter favorites Wolf and Jeffry against real-life league wrestlers.", "date": "Jan 29, 1998"}
