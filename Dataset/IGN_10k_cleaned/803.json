{"name": "Virtual Pro Wrestling 2", "name_review": "Virtual Pro Wrestling 2 (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/22/virtual-pro-wrestling-2-import", "text": "In case you didn't know, WWF Wrestlemania 2000 is one of the most successful third party published titles in the history of the Nintendo 64. It seems wrestling is at least as popular in Japan as it is in the United States and so Japanese N64 fans got their own version of the game known as Virtual Pro Wrestling 2. There's no WWF license so that means no People's Eyebrow, Tombstone or Pedigree. What you do get is a lot more technical wrestling action and that same great Aki wrestling animation that you've seen before.  VPW2 makes use of characters from various Japanese wrestling federations including All Japan and New Japan Pro Wrestling. Because there are some many different organizations represented and the individual wrestlers don't have a lot of distinguishing characteristics, many American fans may not get the same thrill out of VPW2. However, hardcore wrestling fans my recognize guys like Kamala the Ugandan Giant, ECW's former champ Mike Awesome and Vader, most recently of the WWF.  There is more of a focus on technical wrestling in Virtual Pro so there are a few cool moves that we didn't see in Wrestlemania. For instance, when you pick any one of several smaller masked wrestlers, you can guaran-damn-tee that they'll have all kinds of quick reversals, roll-up pin moves and complicated acrobatic attacks. Helicopter spins, incredibly complex submission moves and neat double team attacks go a long way towards keeping fans interested in the action since the presentation of the game is nowhere near what we saw in WM2000.  In comparing the two games, Wrestlemania and Virtual Pro, we noticed several things. The wrestler intros in VPW2 are not very exciting or engaging with static shots of the guy in the locker room staring straight ahead. There's no customized music, drawn out procession to the ring or Titantron video. We have no problem with guys getting focused before a match, but it just doesn't make for a good intro. The announcer does announce the grappler's name when he gets to the ring, however.  The different venues are much better in VPW2 than in WM2000. Going from Raw to Sunday Night Heat to Royal Rumble venues in WM2000 was pretty much a cosmetic change. You can wrestle in the TKO Dome, the Aki office building and even an awesome outdoor stadium converted to a wrestling venue.   For the most part however, WM2000 and VPW2 are the same. The grappling system is the same, the create a player mode is the same and both games have the same incredible way of cheating you at the wrong time. The cool new moves like the Giant Swing where you grab a guy by his ankles and spin him around like a little kid and the Test of Strength, which we haven't seen since the WCW THQ games, are nice additions to a very familiar wrestling engine.   Will the head of the federation come out and take your belt away from you before the last event of the career mode? We couldn't decipher enough of the game to find out but expect some similar challenges and hurdles from VPW2.  The bottom line is VPW2 is a nice addition to the library of the most extreme hardcore wrestling fan. If you liked the recent WWF game because it had the Godfather's Hoes or The People's Elbow, VPW2 may be a too inaccessible for you. If you can't read Japanese, it will help tremendously if you can memorize the menus from Wrestlemania, because all of the buttons and command locations match-up in Virtual Pro Wrestling 2.", "date": "Mar 22, 2000"}
