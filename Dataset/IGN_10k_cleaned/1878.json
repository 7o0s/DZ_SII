Do I even need to bother reading the review? Well, the answer is yes, so let's get this right out on the table because Scooby Doo! Classic Creep Capers is one of those small little gems that's definitely worth taking a second look at. The surprisingly long-lived appeal of Scooby Doo and the Mystery Machine crew may have stumbled in their N64 incarnation, but fans will be happy to see that the Game Boy Color translation is a thoroughly enjoyable romp. Thanks to its tongue-in-cheek humor and faithfulness to the cartoon's tone and visuals, Classic Creep Capers translates the best of the campy series into interactive form. If you're a parent on the prowl for a new game for your child that's fun and family-friendly, Scooby and his friends have got what you're looking for. If you're an older gamer that's in search of something different to tide you over until GBA arrives stateside, then consider taking a bite out of this pocket-sized Scooby Snack. Features 6 chapters filled with multiple puzzles Independent control of Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby Doo Password save Only for Game Boy Color  Like wow! When the Mystery Machine runs out of gas, Scooby and the gang stumble upon the case of a ghostly jewel thief that bears a striking resemblance to the notorious Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll, head of the financially troubled Jekyll Labs and son of the infamous potion-guzzling mad scientist, is the prime suspect in the series of jewel heists. But is Dr. Jekyll really Mr. Hyde? Or is the larcenous specter someone else altogether? Can the kids put an end to this paranormal prowler?  Based on an actual Scooby Doo episode, Scooby Doo! Classic Creep Capers manages to capture the essence of the series in a simple, yet enjoyable mystery adventure. Gameplay involves guiding each of the Scooby crew through a spooky mansion in search of clues, items, and hidden passageways. There's no platform adventuring here, though. Only good-old-fashioned exploration as you try to solve puzzles and unlock the mystery of the ghost of Mr. Hyde. Fans of Maniac Mansion should feel right at home snooping around every nook and cranny of Chez Jekyll for the right piece of the puzzle.   From the game's beginning, you can freely swap back and forth between any of the Mystery Machine's teenage crew (with the exception of Shaggy and Scooby Doo, who you control together). Each of them has their own set of abilities that you'll need to solve the case, whether it's Velma's book-smarts or Scooby and Shaggy's ability to eat massive quantities of food. Despite the fact that much of the game is based on interacting with other characters and using an ever-growing list of items, Classic Creep Capers' simple system for interacting with the world around makes this a perfect match for the Game Boy Color; Pressing the A button brings up a short list of possible actions, while pressing B allows players to access their inventory list. The gameplay is straight-forward and fun, with just the right amount of difficulty to the puzzles to keep them interesting.   The visuals and sound round off Scooby Doo! Classic Creep Capers'appeal. Terrific full-screen cut scenes bring the cartoon to life and propel the story along at a brisk pace. The character animations during the game itself are all classic Scooby Doo, including Scooby's trademark floppy-paw walk. Unfortunately, for a game with so much dialogue, the size of the on-screen text is a touch too small. But even the music manages to create atmosphere without annoying - a small miracle on the Game Boy Color by any estimations. We certainly didn't see this one coming, but Classic Creep Capers is everything a Scooby Doo game should be. The cartoon art, cheese-ball characters, and super-sleuth snooping all come together in a great little mystery. Our only complaint is the short length of the game, which flies by in well under six hours. We're glad that Digital Eclipse focused on well-honed gameplay, but we'd like a little more quantity with our quality. With any luck, we'll be seeing a Scooby sequel coming to GBA before you can say ~Zoinks!~", "date": "Apr 4, 2001"}
