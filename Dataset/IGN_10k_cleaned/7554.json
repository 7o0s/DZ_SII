In a name switch from the past games, once emblazened with the VR Sports ledger, Interplay Sports Baseball 2000 is sort of like the Nintendo 64's labeling, no mistaking this game for someone else's. This blend of arcade and realistic styles aims for a no BS straightforward style that's a far cry from Interplay's efforts of yore.  Interplay's previous games, were in all honesty, not bad games at all, they were just, well, to put it bluntly, ugly and slow. (I'm blunt but not mean!) So this year, the team aimed for better looks, textures, frame rates, and a few other superb little ditties that put this game right up in the contending seat with the big boys. gameplay The most important aspect of any baseball game is how is feels. Is the batting responsive? Does it feel good, etc.? Here, the batting is a simple affair as it was last year. The feel was maintained from last year's game, so old fans will pick it up quick enough. When a batter comers up to the plate, his stats flash on a horizontal bar across the screen's bottom, letting you know just how much or how little power he can muster. These onscreen quick stats are a nice little touch that adds the kind of information you want to know without having to stop progress of the game.  The X button gives you a contact swing, triangle for bunt, and O is a full contact swing. In a nice touch, Interplay's game enables you to aim your swings in the Pro and All-star modes by hitting the D-button and X or O.  The pitching system is a four-button affair, each button representing a kind of pitch and the direction buttons extending the direction you push in. The square button is the specialty pitch, which ranges from sinker to knuckleball, change-up, etc. The entire pitching system is a good, solid simple thing that doesn't pulse with bells and whistles, but enables straightforward no-nonsense play. And of course, pitchers can bean batters and pick off runners with the same relative ease.  The game's fielding is intuitive enough, with fielders moving in the area you push the buttons in and each direction button mocking the diamond setup (up is second base, down is home, etc.). Players can fake a throw, or hit the cut off man, too. Unfortunately, all fielders are hampered by frame rate stutters that are relative easy to ignore..   The game's best feature is its on-the-fly pitcher and defensive strategies status bar, which pops up by hitting R2. This is an excellent, utilitarian access mode that doesn't stop gameplay when initiated and enables players to check on the pitcher's status, the area each ball has been thrown in, whether he's looking good, tired, in great shape, etc. By using this players can also change defensive strategies, too.  With baseball games these days, gamers are treated to more than just straight season play, and Interplay's game doesn't hold out. The gameplay modes range from exhibition, to season play, to a healthy league-based homerun derby to tournaments, to the general manager mode, in which you can trade players or check lineups and bullpens.   But surely the best part of this mode is the Create-a-Player mode. While not shown in a visually stunning setup display, you can still alter everything about the player, from height, weight, lefty or righty, jersey number, and skin tone. After one sets up those attributes, players can select from a total power bar to attribute power, batting, bunting, glove, accuracy, running speed, and arm strength. Later on, these can be imported from memory cards, or edited to your liking. Heck, you can practically create a whole team of these guys.  Graphics In many ways, Interplay's Baseball 2000 beats out EA's arcade-style Triple Play this year around in the graphics department. The textures in particular portray in excellent fashion wrinkles in shirts, player builds such as fore arm strength, and an great overall sense of realism in the way each player looks. Where EA has excellent shading, Interplay has better, more realistic textures. With one exception, and that's in the facial area. These guys all look just like plastic Ken dolls, with the most generic expressions ever, big black eyes, and simplistic half smiles. (~Hi, I'm Ken, wanna play ball?~) That's where Interplay starts to fade. EA's game sports flashy facial expressions in this year's iteration, and it adds to the overall feel of their game.  While Interplay calls the graphics high-res, it looks more like medium-high res to us, which is still a good thing. The players are crisp looking and tightly designed. Another great addition is the smooth motion captured movements that are fleshed out in hordes of fielding animation sequences, dozens of batting stances, including at least 20 major favorites (Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Ken Griffey, Jr, etc.). Some of the great animations we liked included slide catches in the outfield, jumping throws from the infield (however gratuitous they were), and waving off other fielders for a fly ball catch.  Sound This is one area that is lacking. We're sorry to say that music is bland and forgettable. It sure seems like baseball music (cheesy organs, etc.), but the overall effect is a completely sleepy experience. You'll never keep these tunes in your head.  Maybe worse than that is the sound effects. Now normally, I wouldn't rag on this area that much because if the gameplay is good and actual music is there, it gets the gold card treatment. But in baseball, a game of extreme subtleties and color, the music and sound effects generate a mood, the kind of things American novelists and even poets write books about. This is the great American game after all, and it's got to feel like it for Christ's sake. Well, here you get the feeling you're in a ghost town more often than not. The crowd noise is there, the home run banter does exist, but does it generate the feeling or exuberance and wonder? In short, no. The commentary also poses a little problem, too. There's not enough of it, and when it's there, the comments are repetitive or just punchless one-liners.  In the end, Interplay Baseball 2000 is a contender. It's a straight no-frills baseball game that blends a little arcade and a little realism to make an overall impressive title. I had fun playing it, and didn't take too long to get the hang of its many aspects. The biggest disappointment appears in the sound department, where the feeling is hampered by a bizarre, surrealistic quiet that isn't like any game I've been to. I think EA's effort has more bells and whistles, and it's actually a faster-paced game. And lastly, for the first time in ages, EA's game doesn't suffer from bad frame rates, while Interplay's  much better than last year's -- looks a tiny bit slower than the competitors.", "date": "Mar 31, 1999"}
