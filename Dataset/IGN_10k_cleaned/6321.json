This game show has been going on for years  and it's been ported to every game system known to man. Well, not the PlayStation, but Hasbro's about to fill that gap in the system's library.  Wheel of Fortune is simply an elaborate game of hangman  spin the wheel for a dollar amount, pick a letter that's in the puzzle. Guess the puzzle and win the dough. This concludes Game Show 101.  In the PlayStation version, the developers mimic the style of the show through a high-resolution 3D engine. As players spin the wheel, the camera pans and dollies across the virtual set, offering a very television feel to the presentation. Vanna White (the show's co-host) appears through FMV sequences, introducing each of the puzzles and congratulating players on their winnings.  Wheel of Fortune from Hasbro has more than 2,000 different puzzles  if you've got a memory card it remembers which puzzles have already been displayed, so previously played puzzles won't show up until the entire library's played through. Up to three players can go at it, but if solitaire's your thing, you can play Wheel of Fortune by yourself or against two computer opponents. And the length of the game depends on the option select  10, 15, or 20 minute games. At the end of the competition, the winner goes onto a bonus round, where he or she solves the puzzle for a virtual grand prize.   Now we're talking  Wheel of Fortune is a game show that appeals to just about anybody. If you can read, you can play this game. Like Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune is a spot-on conversion of the TV show. It's weird to see such a fantastic 3D engine being used in a game show, but hey, if developers can do it, they might as well flaunt it.Wheel of Fortune will also last a lot longer than Jeopardy, simply because you'll only go through five or six of the game's 2000 puzzles in a game, instead of hammering through 80 questions in Jeopardy in one shot. Plus, if you've been alive for a minimum of ten years, you can probably figure out most of the puzzles.Wheel of Fortune isn't for action freaks, RPG nuts, or racing fans. It's a game to kick back with a couple of your friends for a little guilty pleasure. It won't appeal to many PlayStation owners, but at least now your parents can sneak in some PlayStation time when you're asleep.", "date": "Dec 16, 1998"}
