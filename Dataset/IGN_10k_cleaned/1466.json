Sure, a lot of games look like others, or maybe have a few similarities, but rarely does a developer have the gall to make a game that's exactly the same as another. Well, Eurocom and MGM Interactive have nothing but gall, as Machine Hunter is a dead ringer for Interplay's Loaded.  Both games are overhead shooters. Both games have a lot of blood. And both games have cool lightsourcing. However, where Loaded had a spooky atmosphere and smoothly animated bad guys, Machine Hunter has a forced atmosphere and jerky sprites.  To its credit, it does have two new elements not found in Loaded. The first is an integral part of the premise. You begin the game as a frustratingly hunched-over human, but can transfer your 'energy' into disabled enemy machines. In fact, you have to, as you won't be able to withstand enemy firepower without them. Level design is fairly original as well. Multiple stories have been implemented, giving the game's traditional maze lay-out an interesting twist.     However, despite decent graphics and plenty of blood, Machine Hunter is nothing more than a tired, tedious Loaded. Granted, it's better than the sequel Reloaded, but that's not saying much.", "date": "Aug 20, 1997"}
