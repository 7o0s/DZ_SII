Now I-play follows close behind with the mobile edition of the game, which recreates the essence of Universal's ever-so-slight aping of Mario Kart Double Dash!! The primary mechanic that sets Crash Tag Team Racing apart from your basic racer is the ability to fuse two karts together on the fly, combining not unlike Voltron into one superkart.   Crash Tag Team Racing on handsets manages to replicate one of the problems our IGNPS2 reviewer had with the game design: it's too easy when you fuse karts. You can go fast and have an onboard cannon to clear traffic. What's the impetus to ever do anything different? Fortunately, Crash Tag Team Racing prevents you from remaining fused for entire laps -- it kicks you out of fusion, but then you can go right back into it if you stay close enough to the other kart racer.   Aside from this stumble, it's difficult not to be impressed by some of Crash Tag Team Racing's features. There are four different players and four different karts. This creates multiple fusion opportunities. And the karts do handle differently -- some have better handling, others have better speed. There are only three environments -- Egypt, Castle, and Pirate -- but they are well-drawn with big, bright backdrops.   Crash Tag Team Racing has two play modes: Single race and Tournament. There are nine races in the tournament, which can be completed in about thirty to forty minutes if you are good. This would be a problem, but winning tournaments is the key to unlocking the extra karts. You can then replay the different races with unlocked karts to try for better lap times.   Like most kart racers, Crash Tag Team Racing does have power-ups that you can use in the field. Turbo gives you a fat burst of speed. The mask shields you from attack. Mines can be laid as traps. A homing missile will zero in on the player ahead of you. The basic fare -- but if it ain't broke...   Control is often the biggest downfall of mobile racers -- and Crash Tag Team Racing does have its slipping points. Things feel a little loose, especially around some of the sharper corners. You really have to slow down or plan in advance for the tighter turns, lest you end up in the bush. If you've managed to grab a boost power-up, or sped across one of the zippers on the ground, corners can prove to be hazardous, too.  Crash Tag Team Racing is a very pretty game, with bright, colorful levels. The racers are nicely detailed and also splashed with great paintjobs. The control is a little looser than I wanted, which really comes into play if you get going too fast. Some players may also take issue with a tournament mode that lasts only nine races, but with the unlockables, you have reason to replay a little bit. The fusion technique is an interesting addition to the mix, but as mentioned, I think it makes things a little too easy. Big turbos and an on-board cannon make you just too powerful for the rest of the pack -- especially considering the pack only includes two other players after you fuse. If you want a kart racer for your handset, Crash Tag Team Racing is probably your next advisable fix, but if I had to recommend a racer from I-play, I'd have to go with 2 Fast 2 Furious.", "date": "Nov 7, 2005"}
