From the bowels of the game design universe, Akuma claws its way from the depths and onto retailer shelves in the hopes of spreading its dark influence onto your PC.  With so many Diablo clones out on the market today, and so much quality information available on these types of games, one might start to think that it would be nigh impossible to produce something that even begins to fall short of the mark.  Sadly, these thoughts are quickly put to rest after experiencing the incredibly lackluster presentation brought forth by TriggerSoft's latest work.  After perusing the outside of the package and witnessing acceptable graphics and a possibly intriguing story, I crack open the box and delve into the instruction manual.  Unfortunately, this is an exceptionally short operation as I quickly discover that there in fact is no instruction manual inside.  ~Surely they must have packaged it inside the jewelcase~ I surmise, until coming to the realization that there isn't a jewelcase in here either.  After a bit of rummaging around, I find the game CD inside a simple sleeve, which I mistook as a demo disk when I first saw it.  This was an easy mistake to make since there isn't even a mention of the word ~Akuma~ on the casing itself, only an enlarged logo of the publisher's name and a listing of the other games the company has worked with in the past.  I did breathe a small sigh of relief upon finding a reference card full of game commands, descriptions of items and magic spells, and keyboard shortcuts.  However, this reprieve was short-lived as I began to count a proverbial horn of plenty of spelling and grammatical errors printed on the sheet.  For instance, this masterwork indicates that pressing the left mouse button allows your characters to ~Equipe Stuff~ and one can also purchase ~Mormal Swords~ at the blacksmith shops.  However, if you want the special swords and bows, you'll have to be a little more creative than just opening up your gold sack since these items ~can't not be purchased at shops~.   As if this wasn't enough, the linguistic carnage continued into the magic table with such impressive spell descriptions as ~Ice Rain - make ice rain~ and ~Stone Curse - make enemies stone~.  After determining the effective uselessness of the material in front of me, I decided to scout the CD in search of some other reason to continue torturing myself.  As one may have imagined, the story can be found on the disc itself in what is actually a rather well presented browser format.  Tragically, the format of the story cannot save its content.  The core of this title's background is that Satan himself has been woken up (accidentally mind you) and must now be defeated by a group of three demon hunters known as the Blood Trinity, which you will have the honor of controlling as your main characters.  Defeating Satan involves finding an artifact known as the Blood Sword, which is rumored to be the only weapon capable of bringing the father of all evil to his knees.  Interestingly enough, the story also speaks of two of Satan's lieutenants becoming fed up with his rule and so they, now get this folks, force him into retirement.  That's right ladies and gents, apparently Mr. Pitchfork himself isn't the biggest demon on the block anymore, but incredibly it is still he who you are charged to kill.  In a word....fascinating.  Reading further down the page, I found it even more intriguing that the story seemed to continue to be told even past the point where your adventurers begin their crusade.  In fact, the documentation provided goes through the entire tale, making any story elements that might come forth in-game completely redundant.  I guess the designers at TriggerSoft decided they would go ahead and include the culmination of the plot in with the background story of the title, thus nullifying a major reason for even playing the game.  After all, that's how everyone else does it, isn't it?  Moving into the actual gameplay, we are confronted with at least a few points of note.  As previously stated, you take on the roles of the Blood Trinity, and begin in a Western Village (catchy name isn't it?).  Speaking with some of the local townspeople provides your characters with information and eventually even some small quests to complete in order to advance you on your way to killing Satan.  Navigating through these conversations involves a lot of pointless clicking and references to ~long stories~ which take an overwhelming 7 seconds to tell.  The town denizens are also fans of asking you questions to which there is only one available response, effectively removing any point of even giving you the option to respond anyway.  Items, magic spells, weapons, and armor can of course be purchased here as well, but thankfully you start out rather well equipped.  After all, you are demon hunters.  When the time does come to purchase anything from the vendors though, be certain you click on the category of things you wish to buy since the unforgiving interface dumps you completely out of the shopkeeper screen upon canceling any transaction.  Upon moving out into the wilderness, the only light in the dark closet that is Akuma shines through, but even it is rather dim.  The graphics in the greater environment are passable, and the characters and creatures are animated relatively well.  Combat consists of highlighting your characters and then clicking on the monster you wish to assault.  Spells can be cast on opposing baddies, but to do so only the casting character can be selected since the inventory is only shown for one character at a time.  If you are trying to direct the entire group to assault one enemy, you must first choose to attack that enemy, and then individually highlight each character, find the spell in their inventory that you wish to cast, and then use it.  Hot keys can be assigned to different item slots, but this doesn't really alleviate the tedious nature of such battles.  Defeated creatures seem to drop helpful items more often than not, so the need to purchase health or mana potions (especially since mana regenerates over time on its own) is virtually nil.  Furthermore, enemies are spawned one at a time from ~demon pits~ in the earth, small holes numbering about 8 to a map that emit a red gas supposedly rising from the depths of hell.  If you are running low on experience, I suggest placing your characters around one of these pits and then stepping out for a burger.  Since it takes the game engine an inordinate amount of time to figure out that you are camping the location, your demon hunters should have a level or two by the time you are finished with that last bite.  In the realm of music and sound effects, there are some ups and downs.  Combat sounds, and especially spell incantations, actually sound fairly nice.  However, the music volume defaults to a very low setting, apparently covering up its rather mediocre nature.  The truly entertaining aspect pertaining to these two features comes not in their quality though.  Accessing the options menu, I was treated with the ability to change the volume level of these entities.  As a matter of fact, these were the only options present in the menu at all, so try and enjoy them.  Also, as a sort of ~nail in the coffin~ I suppose, TriggerSoft opted to go ahead and transpose the functions of these two settings.  Thus, utilizing the sound effects arrows in this menu affects the music level, and vice versa.  Ace move guys....  As a sort of final tribute to Akuma before the grand uninstalling, I decided to grab a peek at the credits to see just who was responsible for this epic undertaking.  Apparently, a whopping total of 14 people contributed to this project, but I can't exactly say that came as a shock.  Coming in last on the surprise meter though was the fact that nowhere in the credits did the words ~Quality Assurance~ appear.  In a way I'm almost glad they didn't, because if they had I would most definitely be in fear for the jobs of those involved.  In the filling vat of action role-players out there, Akuma claims to be the ~next generation in RPG game play.~  Well campers, if this is the next generation, I'd just assume stay in this one.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Nov 30, 1999"}
