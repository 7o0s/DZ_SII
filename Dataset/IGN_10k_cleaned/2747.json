Monstrously big. My last gig had me moderating boards for a more general, less game-savvy audience than the crowd here at IGN, and a comment I heard there pretty much socked me one -- around the time State of Emergency hit, kids were debating whether it was worth a buy, and somebody summed up (in a manner that following posts in the thread agreed to), ~It's just full of the same quality I expect from a Rockstar game.~ Yikes. Not only do they know the name (and despite the pomposity in most publishers' press releases when they brag about high customer expectations from the brand, kids still mostly buy games for box art), but they expect Rockstar to suddenly be bullet-proof.  How that affects the company going forward will be interesting, but in some ways, it'd be nice if Rockstar could stay to the simple pleasures that got them their early rep. The Italian Job has been called a PS one game for the GTA3 envious, but gamers will really find this one (actually an import pick-up from the UK's SCI) more along the lines of first-gen PS2 titles Smuggler's Run and Midnight Club. It's execution isn't much more complex than its concept and it's rough on your ego, but the game's engine and structure do well to serve the simple thrill of running about and causing mayhem.  Gameplay The Italian Job is a dirty one -- snatch up and haul away four million dollars in looted gold bullion in a daring heist with a crew of top wheelmen. The tools of your trade are a fleet of 1960s autos ranging from swift Jaguars to wide-turning busses to the lovable little relics of '60s England, the Mini Cooper. Half of the job is getting everything straight so you don't blow it and get everybody nabbed by the coppers, so a good deal of your time is spent testing your driving skills in downtown London before jetting off to Turin, Italy for the big job.  Sounds like a getaway that calls for a certain wheelman you know? Naturally, the game owes a lot to Driver, and puts a serious chase on that classic. Reflections still commands the driver's seat of the wheelman genre, despite developer PixeLogic's best moves. Cars in The Italian Job really get moving and bust through the city with skill, but there's not quite the same difference of feel between vehicles outside of speed stats. Cornering can be mastered, but you can't throttle through turns like you'd wish, and the handbrake seems stickier and less helpful. (And why do none of these games all about auto infatuation feature manual shifting?) That said, the game only reluctantly cedes the wheel to Driver by margins, and the only real troubles with the control are that control in reverse or at low speeds (under 15) are aggravatingly dead. Otherwise, it whips roads hard and fast on your command.  Some of the best features of The Italian Job are also tacks in its tires. PixeLogic has drummed up a gigantic city for the game and has packed the roads full of traffic. It's an impressive live world, a spaghetti-strew of streets with plenty of landmarks and unique buildings that seem real enough to not get lost in once you've learned the lay of the land. Its sprawling design and traffic flow leave Driver behind and even give early PS2 titles like Midnight Club a run for their money. All this comes with an engine that never stops for a loading screen. Spiffy indeed, but with the short runs that you usually have to make in the different stages of the game (and especially in the short mini-games), that PAINFUL initial load for the level spins out a lot of the game's easy momentum. The busy traffic also drags down the breezy feel once you find out how much of the game is on a set track. The same cars will be in your way at certain times, and cops will camp out in the exact same alcoves every time. Memorize what's going to happen in any of the number of times you'll redo a challenge (it's a rough game, and only gets easier when you've played through it and stop making mistakes from driving at reckless speeds trying to beat the cruel clock), and you're on your way.      Later levels of the game really start to pick the game up -- London just isn't laid out as craftily as the wilin' Tourin level, and has less big thrills to find. Combined with a much more fun time limit structure (you'll still be on a tight time limit, but missions that stretch several minutes and incorporate multiple challenges really turn you loose on the city), and the game redeems itself heartily. Frankly, I wrote it off in the early go-arounds and didn't find it much more than a competent wheeler (despite a lot of variety in the challenges, including a prison break-out with chasing cops and a smash-hunt ala the old Chase HQ). The game's second stage, however, really opens up in a mad layout filled with crazy features sending your car careening through the air or barreling through tight turns. It also gives you a lot more to do when the cops and the Mafia are on your tail besides simply driving fast and whipping turns in hopes of dusting your pursuers. Good stuff is in this stage that's worth memorizing and toeing the line in the first city's bland runs. Too bad Italy drives on the right -- you have no idea how much fun and challenge it is getting used to bombing at full speed through traffic that's all on the wrong side of the road until you're in it.  Graphics  Seeing previews elsewhere on this game, I started to get the impression that some people haven't played a PlayStation game in a long, long while. It's almost as if all these kiddie quickies have washed away any memories of what this machine is capable of. Italian Job does a good job reminding people again with a solid and well-running effort that puts all kinds of business on the screen without ever choking (enough to remind some PS2 developers, as mentioned earlier, just how much hardware they have in front of them now and how much harder they should be working it.)   It's not a beautiful game in this day and age (the resolution of a PS one game is tough to go back to) but the variety of visuals is pretty astounding for 2 megs of memory. Buildings running on the sides aren't just repeating facades, and some landmarks render an impressive look with conservative geometry. Cars are properly detailed and feature destructible parts (it takes some effort, but you can rip your tires off). All this still comes with a framerate that never dips -- sometimes it runs TOO fast when nothing's about, but otherwise it's solid around 20. Several of cars can dot an alley while you're juggling dozens of trash cans and cones, but the game keeps moving. There's even some fancy tricks that you're noticing on next-gen big-bros, including particle effects on crashes, sun glaring through trees and blowing newspapers on the streets. PixeLogic gets a lot of the angular, tight design of the game's city -- while the layout isn't as complex as Driver's mass of freeways and alleys, the narrow and low view keeps a lot of polys off of the system, meaning that you'll hardly ever notice a draw-in through the whole game, so buildings and cars won't suddenly appear two feet out in front of you. The only complaint I could have is that the night scenes are weak (headlights are just pasted-on transparent glares and don't light anything -- boo) and, on the tiny PS one screen, the annoying little barrier rails that dot London suddenly become invisible car-eaters.  Sound There's three things that put this game distinctively in '60s London -- one's the little Mini Cooper cars, and the other two are in the sound. Rockstar (by way of SCI) has something fairly unique in that respect -- no other game gets in that lost era, and none really do it like The Italian Job does with it's relaxed atmosphere and cozy narrator. Quincy Jones wrote the original score for the film that the game comes from -- a mellow, bluesy, upbeat harmonica tune entirely inappropriate for a high-speed chase, making it somehow perfectly appropriate for a high-speed chase (and thus this game) by way of the '60s. Then there's the game's crew, particularly the character played by Michael Caine in the film and mimicked in the game -- the man's gotten some work recently, but otherwise, Michael Caine in a lead role could only mean you're in the flower-power era. It's a hoot to hear the cockney character in the game popping off at 'toffee-nosed jerks' and warning against getting 'nicked' by the cops. Unfortunately, the budget on this little effort didn't afford for it to really go all out -- the same voice actor is used for almost all the parts, making them nearly indiscernible from each other (and sometimes pretty sad-sack for the effort when the voce artist pitches high or low but still seems to be the same general character.) Even pedestrians sound like the same one guy. Also, the soundtrack has just a few songs, so while the initial impression of these wacky tracks is nice, you'll tire quickly of the same two songs.If you're like me, you've been a bit startled by the raves heaped on this game. The PS one is starved for games for months, suddenly one comes along that isn't a pile, and everybody who still cares falls all over themselves for it. Myself, I've been playing a lot of PlayStation games recently, including plenty of auto outings like PixeLogic's own Crime Killer. This game's not getting off easy just for running competently on an aging system. Fortunately, the developers pushed plenty on the system and juiced it with some strong gameplay in an era where it wasn't really expected. Fans of the movie aren't just being served cack on a cracker.For all its boons, I'm still not sure this game is a must-own for backwards-looking PS2 gamers brave enough to deal with bleary resolution in the pursuit of gameplay (maybe at its budget price, but we tend not to review based on price unless it's really a distinct factor.) The variety and play still can't stand up to the bakers' dozens of PS2 and Xbox games that are in its field. However, for PS one gamers jealous of Crazy Taxi, Midnight Club and GTA, especially those who've already blasted through Driver or are looking to rinse away memories of the botched Driver 2 (it's not better than Driver, but it's a great companion to Infogrames' classic), there aren't a lot of scruples that should keep you from taking The Italian Job.", "date": "Jun 18, 2002"}
