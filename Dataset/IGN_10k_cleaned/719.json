The company has the opportunity to produce choice classic titles for the Game Boy, and with Hasbro owning a backlog of Atari titles, that's a whole lot to choose from. The company's done Pong, and Missile Command, but one of Majesco's first was a conversion of the old Atari arcade and 2600 game, Super Breakout.. And you know, I'm really beginning to wonder if the guys programming these Game Boy games were fans of the old stuff  this is yet another remake from the company that's just lacking in so many ways. Features Four game modes One or two players For Game Boy and Game Boy Color   To its credit, Majesco did add all the game features from the classic brick buster. You can knock balls in the standard mode, a double wall mode, a ~cavity~ mode where you can free two locked balls from gaps in the field, and the intense falling wall ~progression~ mode. But the concept and options is all the game has going for it.  The problem is the implementation of how the game actually plays. You still move a paddle back and forth, eliminating the field of bricks with a bouncing ball, and losing the ball too many times ends your game. But the trajectory of the ball bouncing off your paddle isn't the same  I admit, that's getting a little nit-picky, but it's true. But the worst part of all is the fact that once the wall has been eliminated, the ball disappears, the screen resets, and the ball reappears back in the original starting position. WRONG. In the classic game, the wall returned when the ball hit your paddle, keeping the game in play. This may also seem like picking nits, but here's the problem: In a game like Cavity, when you're bouncing multiple balls at once, the trick in the original Super Breakout was to get one ball at the top of the screen when the whole wall disappears. When another ball hits the paddle, the wall would reappear, trapping the ball at the top of the screen. The trapped ball would bounce back and forth, scoring maximum points eliminating the top portion of the wall with nowhere else to go. In this version, you don't get this strategy or bonus  even worse, if you had two or three balls in play when you cleared out the field, the balls would disappear...giving you only one ball on the next turn.  On top of this, the game loses the original feel because the game really needs the analog knob for control. It's just not the same pushing left and right on the D-Pad, since the game was about letting your mind judge distances from knob to on-screen paddle.  And as a final note, just looking at the copyright screen is proof enough that the game was thrown together as quickly as possible  Super Breakout's copyright is credited to Konami, not Atari or Hasbro. Obviously someone quickly cut and pasted a few lines of code from the Frogger source before this game was sent out the door... I love the classics...that goes without saying. But if you're going to acquire the rights, do the game right. Look at the original, see how it plays, and base it off of that. Only stray from the design if you think it's going to improve gameplay. The programming in Super Breakout kills the potential fun the game could have had, even with the limited digital controls of the Game Boy system. The game isn't terrible, especially if you never grew up with the game, but it's definitely not an ~average~ Game Boy game.", "date": "Feb 17, 2000"}
