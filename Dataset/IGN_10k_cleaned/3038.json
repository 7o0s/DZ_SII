The only apparent missing ingredient was a franchise mode.  A new basketball season is about to begin and Drive returns in 2003 form offering a Dynasty Mode, some post-up dekes, and Kenny ~The Jet~ Smith-added smack talk.  What's missing though is any online functionality whatsoever, which is a big disappointment from a first-party game.  And as much as we loved Drive last year, it feels a little weak this year against the competition.  Little has really changed and Drive is in danger of slipping into oblivion if big things don't come next year.  Features  Every NBA team and player Practice mode so you can improve your game Dynasty Mode lets you play for up to 25 years Create-a-player function lets you develop your player throughout the year Kenny Smith adding color commentary  Gameplay If you enjoyed Drive last year, you won't find too much different this time around.  Only a small smattering of new gameplay additions have been added, including on-the-fly play-calling and minor touches to the post-up game.  So while the game plays much like last year, which was an enjoyable in-your-face NBA experience, it seems a little worn out.  With NBA 2K3 and NBA Live 2003 making sizable additions to their gameplay, Drive is being left behind.  Yes, the game was a lot of fun last year, but that doesn't mean there weren't some things that could have seen an upgrade.  And unfortunately, Drive chooses to toe the gameplay line, with the only significant addition being the franchise mode, which should be in every sports game anyway.  If that seems a bit overly-harsh, keep in mind that sports games come out yearly.  Companies expect you to pay $50 every year for another edition.  The Dynasty Mode certainly adds value, but as you'll see, the majority of the game was barely touched up by High Voltage.  NBA Inside Drive 2003 is definitely your game if you don't want the simmy aspects of 2K3 or the over-the-top arcade feel of Live.  It's the happy medium.  While Drive has plenty of arcade aspects including some great smack talk and plenty of drives to the hoop, the AI is tuned intelligently to provide touches of the real NBA experience.  You'll be able to see and recognize plays developing and pressure will increase depending on the game situation.  The computer AI will throw into the post, get double-teamed and kick out for an open three-pointer.  While it's not sim-perfection it's the kind of balance a lot of gamers will enjoy.  Many people ask for a sim, but it's not what they actually want.  Last year's post game was decent, but this year it's been slightly improved with the addition of post moves.  Now while holding down the Left Trigger you can push back soft or hard on the defender, step out and shoot, or perform a hook shot.  It's a good start, but battles in the post aren't terribly exciting here.  There's not a lot of fighting for position and you just don't feel enough pressure in the post.  The name is Inside Drive for a reason, and driving the lane will likely be your main point-grabber.  That's not to say the post game is obsolete, because it's certainly a good way to score points down low (and probably the best area for defense), but there needs to be some more value added to the post game.  Plays can be called on the fly with the D-Pad, but like NBA 2K3, plays are all very specific.  With a more arcade experience, the game needs to be less about the X and the O and focus on fast and easy.  The D-Pad play-calling can be very helpful is with defensive pressure.  You can set multiple levels of defense, including the type of defensive intensity and defensive coverage.  Up, down, left, and right on the D-Pad open a different menu each with four selectable options (chosen by using the D-Pad).  It takes you about two seconds to switch to a full court press and then just as quickly you can revert to man-to-man coverage.  Sliders have been included this year to allow you to adjust human and AI performance.  You can affect the following things: Player speed, blocks, steals, two-pointers, three-pointers, free throws, dunks, dekes, and hook shots.  The first thing you will almost certainly want to do is push the player speed way up, because the default speed is a bit too slow.  In fact, I wasn't loving Drive at all until I got the speed going.  Don't be shy, and pump it up.    Penalties, which were a bit out of hand last year, can be adjusted in a different menu and set to off, lenient, normal, or strict.  While the default normal mode will, in the end, give you the most realistic number of fouls, many of those will feel bogus.  There are some minor collision detection problems so when trying to move past someone, just trying to get down court on defense, the game will knock the other player down and hit you with a pushing foul.  A lot of fouls are difficult to see and seem a bit cheap.  So, even though you'll have less fouls than in a realistic basketball game, going down to lenient will likely help make the game more enjoyable.  It's a good thing the sliders are there, because there are a lot of minor things that upset me.  While I can accept missing some layups, dunks, and open shots in the sim 2K3 it seems a bit of an annoyance here.  Drive 2003 floats between sim and arcade and the balance is tenuous.  Too arcadey and it will feel like a joke, but go too sim and it makes a game supposed to be loose and fast a bit tedious.  It seems from this latest version that there may be a move towards a more sim experience.  I'd say avoid that.  You will likely need to adjust some sliders so the game plays to your liking, but overall it's still a great basketball experience.  But going sim would be a poor choice for Microsoft and High Voltage.    While the gameplay remains essentially the same (and that's fine because overall the gameplay is good), the lack of presentation enhancements is a big disappointment.  The variety of dunks can't stand up with the competition.  This is where Drive needs to dominate.  Dunks should have your jaw dropping and there should be such a great variety that you'll be seeing new dunks at ten games into the season.  But that's not the case this year.  The weak presentation continues with the menu system, the Dynasty Mode, player awards, the playoffs, and player introductions.  Drive, as the fun color commentary suggests, is meant to be an in-yo-face slam-bang, jaw-dropping, hoops experience.  But it's dry.  The presentation is lackluster and identical to last year.  No time was spent on giving the game more flavor.  It's like a piece of grape Bubble Yum -- it's full of grape sugary goodness when you first bite into it, but chew it long enough and it looses all flavor.  That's what's beginning to happen with Drive, a competitor last year with Sega for best hoops game on Xbox.  The biggest strike against Inside Drive, and one I won't mix words about, is the lack of online functionality.  Though originally announced as having downloadable content, the retail version of NBA Inside Drive 2003 will have no head-to-head online play or downloadable content.  This isn't acceptable from a first party game with a title coming out during the launch of their online service.  Online basketball certainly can be done, as Sega has proven, and downloadable content should have been a priority right off the bat.  This simply puts Drive even further back in the pack.  You just can't have a third party schooling you on your own system's hyped feature.  It shows a lack of forethought and again makes Drive seem like the same horse Microsoft rode last year.  Dynasty Mode Dynasty Mode was added from last year and overall it's good, though not dazzling.  It's relatively standard overall, with the option for a fantasy draft at the start of your Dynasty.  Trades are fairly good, with teams offering you comparable players.  And you can't get away with murder either, so good luck trading for Shaq.  At the end of the season there are awards, even for the playoffs.  And then you begin the draft.  There's no scouting though, so you just have to go by a player's displayed skill.  This seems a little thin as the draft is a big deal in basketball.  It's only two rounds, but hey, a good draft can turn a franchise around quickly.  Still, though there are no frills added, it's a good franchise mode for the first time out.  The best part, and probably the best thing about Drive this year, is the create-a-player option.  There are a ton of attributes that make up your player, along with sliders to dictate how the AI plays them.  Each different skill set (physical, offense, defense) has its own set of points to spend on the various attributes grouped within.  Playing the game (and you get no points when you sim) earns you points in the various categories.  Get 10 rebounds in a game, you get points to spend on your defensive skill-set, for example.  Your player starts out rated around a 70 overall.  But by playing through an entire season, you can greatly increase that skill.  This is one thing that will keep many people coming back to Drive this year.    The only problem, if it is a problem, is that you tend to let your created player ball hog.  That is, unless you use created players for all five starters.  You start as the Warriors and in a year or two you're the most dominant team in the league.  A great idea and even better when you change the settings so that you only play as your created man.     Graphics NBA Inside Drive looks identical to last year, though it actually seems to chop every once in a while.  Most every face is accurate and looks close to the true NBA counterpart.  Drive has an interesting overall look, where players almost seem cut out from the arenas.  It's an interesting technique and makes each one stand out a bit more.  Some new animations have been added, including some nice layups, but overall you'll see the same stuff as last year.    Players have taunting animations following dunks, different animations before shooting free throws, and there are cut scenes showing the bench.  Drive does a good job of keeping the game fluid, keeping it from ever feeling flat or slow.  The stadiums look great and the crowds aren't bad either.  Anyone familiar with these stadiums will find most to be strikingly similar.  But there are some details that aren't right.  For example, the Warriors have a press section taking up half the area behind one of the baskets.  But that's not in Drive.  It's minor things like that that can be picked on, but overall the stadiums have some great detail and some good depth.  Sound Inside Drive is the only basketball game to feature four commentators -- Three in booth and one on the floor.  Your two favorites from last year, Kevin Calabro and Marques Johnson are back, and added to the booth is Kenny ~The Jet~ Smith.  Kenny is there strictly to talk smack and though he doesn't get in on a lot of the intimate play-by-play and color commentary, he gives plenty of gifts of smack.  The commentary has the kind of flavor that seems to be draining from the rest of the game.  Smith interjects even more humor to last year's fray.    There are plenty of moments where you will laugh out loud.  Drive is a great game for people who can't talk their own smack, because the game does it for them.  Make a bad pass, shot, or step out of bounds and these three will be all over you.  Fantastic commentary and the play-by-play is usually accurate and on time.  The fourth member, Akemi Takei, provides injury updates and closing analysis of games.  Everyone should have four people chattering during a game, it gives you some variety. I loved Inside Drive last year, but now it feels a bit stale.  That's not to say it's a bad game, but it definitely is in need of some freshness.  Certainly a good choice for anyone who doesn't like the heavy-sim feel of NBA 2K3, Drive won't disappoint first-time players.  But if you were expecting a big update to the franchise, this isn't it.  Instead, you will mainly get a good franchise mode and a stellar create-a-player option, but little in the way of new gameplay.  The lack of online functionality hurts, especially the potential longevity of the game.", "date": "Oct 10, 2002"}
