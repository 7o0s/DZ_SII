Medal of Honor, the series that arguably established the popular pastime of shooting Nazis in the noggin, is the first to attack, beating Brothers In Arms and Call of Duty to the handheld. However, while Heroes looks like an impressive portable debut, capturing a good deal of what made the console versions so popular, it's hampered by awkward controls and a woefully short campaign mode.   The game starts impressively enough, with the rousing signature theme and black and white video clips setting the scene superbly. This high level of presentation, consistent with all EA games, is continual throughout the game, with crisp visuals, varied environments and the cacophony of gunfire making the missions more dramatic and intense. Naturally a few compromises have had to be made during the transition from home console to handheld, such as the occasional blurry texture and the odd missing frame of animation but, at its heart, the game still feels - and more importantly plays - like Medal of Honor.    Yet, as soon as you try your hand at the first mission, it all starts to go a bit awry. Players have long wished for a second analogue nub on the PSP and the lack of one hurts the first-person shooter more than most. EA has tried to accommodate everyone's preferences with four different control set-ups but none of them really work that well. The default 'Commando' setting has movement on the nub, with the control buttons on the face of the console handling your direction. This makes aiming sticky and imprecise if you don't up the horizontal and vertical look speeds, making the first few showdowns chaotic and confusing.    Thanks to the general lack of free buttons, a number of commands are dumped onto the d-pad and - because there are so many commands to squeeze into so little space - you'll find buttons tend to double up. For instance, 'up' uses a medikit but it's also used to pick up a gun or kick away a grenade, depending whether you tap or hold it. This often means you'll accidentally drop or pick up a weapon when you meant to boost your health, or use your last health pack when you're barely bleeding. It's frustrating, especially because while you're faffing with the controls the enemy is ripping through your health bar with a chorus of bullets. Even more absurd, to jump you have to hit 'select', so - unless you've got double-jointed digits - it's impossible to move and fire seamlessly without getting your fingers in a knot.    Campaign mode sees you assuming the role of three characters from previous games in the series, including Lieutenant Patterson from Frontline, although this amounts to little more than a name and rank appearing on the mission briefing. Missions take place in a variety of environments across Europe: one moment you'll be tearing up an air base, the next bombing down a coastline before weaving through winding streets and trudging through snowy plains. Routine marches through endless corridors are certainly not a problem here.     Unfortunately this variety is not matched by the objectives that make up each mission, most of which are dull as ditchwater. If you're not detonating something with an explosive charge, you're reclaiming control of a Nazi stronghold or just killing a whole load of enemies in a given time limit. The secondary objectives are even shallower, consisting almost solely of pilfering plans with the occasional assassination. This isn't to say the game doesn't have its entertaining moments; holding an area while being bombarded by enemy fire is pretty intense and exhilarating, but doing it three times in a row makes the appeal wear thin. By the halfway point, the novelty value of playing Medal of Honor on PSP starts to fade, simply because it's the same thing again and again.   Yet the biggest problem with the campaign is that there just isn't enough of it. An average player will be able to blast through the game in around five hours and that's taking into account completing secondary objectives. Once you're familiarised with the controls, it really isn't that difficult at all, with the developers perhaps taking the instruction 'At Ease' a little too literally. It's possible to breeze through the missions for the most part, with only a stray grenade or apparently random surge of Nazis holding you back. Admittedly further play-throughs unlock extra characters for other modes but it's unlikely you'll want to submerge yourself in the fog of war a second time around unless you're a total completist.    Thanks to its outrageous brevity, Heroes really needs to impress with its other modes. For those who want to shoot some soldiers in quick bursts there's Skirmish - effectively a deathmatch against up to 16 bots - which simply requires you to ratchet up more kills than your opponents. This provides much-needed longevity and, thanks to its frenetic pace, it's just as compelling - if not more so - than the campaign game. It's a shame you can't boost the AI's challenge, but that's a small price to pay when you can careen around Belgium in pink pyjamas being shot at by a Nazi called Dave.    All said, the most impressive feature of the game - considering we're talking the PSP here - is the chance to engage in 32-player online multiplayer, as well as eight-player ad-hoc. Although there isn't a great deal of originality on display (modes cover the usual Capture the Flag and deathmatch fare), the option to change maps on the fly is a nice touch, as is being able to use a PC as a private server. Nevertheless, Heroes' multiplayer game is definitely its strongpoint and would've been more so if there were a few interesting multiplayer levels to take advantage of.For the most part Medal of Honor Heroes is a solid and competent experience, although its never as engrossing as it could be, thanks to the clunky controls. The campaign is woefully short too but, if you're a fan of the series or you plan to take the game online, theres plenty to get your teeth stuck into. For the rest of us it might be worth holding off until someone really nails the first-person shooter genre on PSP. Heres keeping out (painfully mangled) fingers crossed.", "date": "Nov 20, 2006"}
