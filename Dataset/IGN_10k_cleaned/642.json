Tech Romancer)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/01/22/kikaioh-import-tech-romancer", "text": "Some games manage to appear out of nowhere and shock the electricity out of you.  Come on, you know the kind of game I'm talking about - a Gunstar Heroes, a Tokyo Xtreme Racer - games you may not have heard much about ahead of time, but when you first have a go at it, you know you're in love.  These types of games are the direct opposite of the likes of Shenmue and Final Fantasy, in that they've received little or no hype from their creators.  Kikaioh, the Japanese version of what should be arriving stateside from Capcom in April under the name Tech Romancer fits the bill perfectly.  With giant robot fighters, anime-style characters, and enough parodies to keep Japanese animation experts busy for months, it's no wonder this game never saw full release in American arcades.  That's a cryin' shame, though, as look beside all those quirky elements, and you'll find yourself with a refreshing take on the fighting genre from the company that first made VERSUS FIGHTING a staple of gaming so many years ago.  You know the drill.  You and a friend each pick a warrior and head out to the battle field for a number of rounds of one on one fighting.  You each have various moves available to you, along with specials moves accessible via button combinations . . . yadda, yadda, yadda.  I don't think I need to do a little Introduction to Fighting Games 101, now do I?  Kikaioh starts with the basic premise found in all fighting games, but adds much to the formula in order to differentiate itself from the rest of the pack (most notably, Capcom's earlier Star Gladiator 2 - definitely a lesson in how to craft a horribly generic fighter).  There are all sorts of little things that gamers who've played fighters for years will notice, and come to appreciate.  Fighters have damage meters, which fill up as you fight.  Each time you're hit, the damage goes up, but if you manage to sneak away from the action for a bit, some damage will slowly heal.  Reach maximal damage, and BAM!  Round over, buddy!  In this game, though, the line between rounds is somewhat blurred, as damage isn't refilled, and the fight continues pretty much immediately in another part of the stage.  You'll find various other unique features beyond these two moderately superficial areas.  How would you like a fighting game where you can pick up items for later use?  Kikaoh is that game.  Items, ranging from power-ups to recovery capsules, make an appearance through the fights as you pummel your foes and the background objects.  You can stockpile up to five items, and can cycle through and use them at your liking.  The availability of items adds, unquestionably, another dimension to the fighting genre.  I could go on and on with the other additional features that set this apart from a standard fighter.  Characters have final attack moves, which can be used when you've pummeled your opponent to fifty percent damage.  These attacks are difficult to connect, but if they do, terminate a weak opponent instantly - a welcome feature when fighting a crappy player, and when you do manage to connect against a stronger player, the adrenaline rush is godly.  How about some Soul Edge-style clashes?  They're in here, and are decided by paper-rock scissors, just like in the Namco classic.  I still haven't figured out how to consistently get these, but maybe that's why it's a special moment when they occur.  There's also an under-used armor system, where armor that your character is using depletes with every blow.  Loose armor, and the level of damage increases.  You can actually find armor repair power-ups among the items dropped in mid battle . . . ain't it pretty how everything's connected together?  What's that?  Armor?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I forgot one important point.  You aren't using human world warriors in Kikaioh.  No, this game is all about pitting giant, anime-influenced robots against one another.  Some of these guys are humanesqe and could probably take on Ryu and Ken in a one on one battle for speed, but  you'll also find more bulky warriors, for whom distance attacks are a must.  Regardless of the type of robot, all of these guys are well constructed and animated beautifully.  The robots have superficial characteristics that separate them from human fighters, so Wise Duck fires missiles and Kikaioh (G. Kaiser in the US version) fires laser blasts.  You'll find no spiritual fire balls in this game, but I suppose it's all the same.  More importantly is the fact that all the robots are unique, and with eight immediately selectable fighters, you'll have more than enough variety in play.  Beyond just giving us the eight unique fighters, though, Capcom has done something that should be followed by future fighting game developers.  Kikaioh has what I'd have to consider the greatest single player mode ever in a fighting game.  It works on two levels, the first being a Powerstone-style rewards system, where you're rewarded with VMU mini games, secret characters, and art galleries by playing through the game multiple times.  This is actually identical to the system found in Powerstone, right down to the forms of awards you can win, but what makes this so much better is that earning those rewards is an absolute joy because going through the arcade mode from beginning to end is far more tolerable.  Once you've selected your warrior, you can opt to go through a challenge mode in which you fight a total of twelve successive fights, one after the other.  Okay, ho-hum, it's been done before.  The other option available once you've chosen your fighter, the story mode, is what's interesting, though.  In this mode, you fight on average six fights against various opponents against a background story.  What's cool is that you're given an option every now and then on how to make the story progress, and the option you choose determines who you fight next.  Even better is that your actions in a given fight, whether you choose to finish up on a final attack move, for instance, is also occasionally used to determine upcoming events.  The single player fighting mode is made vastly more replayable than the one for Powerstone because even when choosing the same character, the experience is different every time.  Thankfully, one of the options that opens up early on in the game allows you to view the various branching points in the story for any character with whom you've passed the game.  I'm not sure exactly, but my interest in the one player game may be influenced by more than just the multiple paths through the story and the rewards system.  See, I'm into the whole Japanese animation thing, and that's what Kikaioh is based on.  The stories in the story mode, which detail the exploits of the pilots of the various mechs, are similar to what you'll find in Japanese animation of various forms, from comical series to the more serious stuff.  Between fights, you're witness to voiced cut scenes that progress the stories along.  Capcom has even given each fighter's story mode a name, complete with a title screen and eye catch - animation fans will be in heaven.  I do wish Capcom had cleaned up the game a bit in order to rid it of blank loading screens between scenes - it would have made things flow a bit better.  I managed to ignore this after a bit of playing, though.   I may be raving about the game, but Kikaioh is definitely not for everyone.  Certainly, the story mode isn't going to have quite the same appeal if you aren't up on your Japanese animation at the level where you can appreciate the references.  Beyond that, the fighting system itself isn't the most refined out there.  The fully 3D movement is a bit on the awkward side, certainly not at the level of Soul Calibur (which was a bit awkward in its own right).  Also, the game seems prone to button mashing more-so than other fighters, with part of the problem being the abundance of flashy moves.  Unfortunately, Capcom forgot to include a training mode in the game, meaning you're going to have to experiment using the trick of going into versus mode alongside an unmanned controller.  If you are a Japanese animation fanatic, though, or if you can overlook the problems here and there in the fighting system, you'll definitely find yourself with a unique, and all-together enjoyable fighting game.  Let's hope Capcom of America gives American games an appropriate translation (read ~give us an option for subtitling the animation sections!!!~).", "date": "Jan 22, 2000"}
