The original game, while not without its share of flaws, struck a chord with many gamers due to its more realistic take on the sport. You weren't going to see any hundred-foot airs and quadruple backflips in Amped. No; but what you did get was a realistic snowboarding game that was a bit too unforgiving at times, but captured the essence of the sport in a new and fresh way.  Now gamers are finally getting Amped 2. While the game is not radically different from the first, the polished gameplay and online component make this game the best of its kind on the Xbox.  Gameplay Amped 2 bears an uncanny resemblance to the first game, though closer inspection will reveal a few tweaks and refinements that make the game an overall more enjoyable experience. Let's start with the basics. The left analog stick moves your character, while holding the right stick in any of the eight directions will perform a grab trick. This isn't a setup that everyone is use to - especially those weaned on the likes of SSX or even Tony Hawk -- but for Amped, it works great.   To understand how the point system works, you'll have to get the idea that more is better out of your head; performing more flips and grabs, while good, will not score you as many points as performing a single flip with more style. Style points are accumulated by performing flips and turns more slowly. As you turn/flip, your score will increase dramatically. Throwing in a tweaked grab or two will also boost your trick score. This system forces players to be more calculated in their moves as pulling off stylish tricks can be more risky than pulling off something like a double flip. We really like this dynamic as it requires skill and can be very challenging to do successfully.  Strategy Guide Available! Become King of the Bunny Hill! Free!  It's time to cut it up on the fresh powder with IGN's free guide, which includes maps of the biggest mountains and tips straight from the developer!  Get The Guide | See Other Free Guides  Also new to Amped 2 is the butter, which is essentially a manual for snowboards. It was inevitable that a trick of this nature - one that can be used to link tricks - would find its way into the game. Now, in theory, an entire run can be made into one combo, allowing for much, much higher scores than in the last game. Additionally, the game is much more lenient when it comes to landing tricks. No longer do you have to land tricks perfectly straight as in the first Amped. There are still times when you'll feel like you should've landed a trick and don't, but overall, it's a big improvement.    One of the biggest additions to the game is the snowskate mode. As most of you know, snowboards are usually attached to the boarder's feet. Well, someone's gone and made it where the board is free, much like a skateboard. This new variation on the sport is called snowskating, and it's included in Amped 2. Not having the board attached to your feet complicates matters a bit. With the mode selected, players will have to always perform a grab when in the air to make sure the board doesn't slip away. But with this new freedom, you'll now be able to perform kickflip tricks using the X button, and also a new set of lip and rail tricks. In more ways than not, the game becomes more like Tony Hawk than Amped. We really liked this new mode because it brings a whole new dynamic to the game, but unfortunately, it's not available on every mountain.  Amped 2 includes just about every mode from the first game including career, free ride, just ride, and multiplayer. The career mode has remained virtually unchanged. You'll still have to score high scores and media scores, please sponsors and play follow the leader with other pro boarders. The snowman hunt even makes a return. But the real reason to start playing Amped 2 is for the new online modes. The Xbox Live menu screen has all the typical Live options (quick and optimatch, downloadable content, friends, etc.) and also includes an XSN Sports option.       In terms of online modes, you can ride in the Just Ride mode with up to eight players. Your scores will then be ranked among all the other players playing online so you can see how you stack up against the competition. Then there are the online Session modes. There are four, the first being High Score. This is your standard score mode where the player with the highest score at the end of the run wins. Best Trick ranks players based on the score of, well, their best trick.   King of the Mountain is very much like the Graffiti mode in Tony Hawk; players score on specified obstacles and the player with the highest scoring trick captures the said obstacle. The last of the modes, Trick Race, has players racing down to the end of the run, the first person down being the winner. The catch is that you have to score a set number of points on certain objects on you way down or else you freeze for a user-specified number of seconds.   Of course, every mode has a number of user-definable parameters such as time limit, penalties, point thresholds, board type (snowboard or snowskate) and such, so tailoring each competition is a piece of cake. After playing each of the modes online with other competitors, it's clear that the online play will Amped 2's strongest feature. Even though every mode supports up to eight players online, even having only two or three players go at it is a blast. We noticed no lag, and trash-talking is as fun as ever. Add in the leader boards and you've got yourself the best (and only) online snowboarding game on the Xbox.  Graphics Amped 2 is an overall good looking game with decent character models and all-around sharp textures, but where the game really shines is in the sheer scope of the mountains. Simply put, they're enormous. Just when you think the track couldn't possibly go on any further, it does. This was also a trait found in the first game, so we're glad to see that the game didn't get any smaller.   Further emphasizing the size of the mountains is the draw distance. Looking down across the mountain, you can see for what seems like miles and miles, with not even a hint of fogging or draw-in. Impressive indeed. Again, with the mountains being the real star of the show, everything else takes a backseat, though that's not a negative remark in anyway. As noted before, the character models are competent and the textures on the snow and track objects look quite nice. They won't win any awards or anything, but they more than get the job done. Accordingly, the rest of the environments including trees, houses, and whatnot all follow suit in a similar good but not outstanding quality.     The animations in Amped 2 look good and assumingly represent their real-life moves in an accurate way. Sometimes the transitions between animations can look a little jerky - particularly when bailing - but at this point we're really nitpicking. The game overall looks better than average and the game maintains a consistent framerate. Considering the size of the mountains, we're actually impressed.  Sound Most extreme sports games opt for a licensed music soundtrack and Amped 2 is no different. Where the game does vary from other games is that instead of a relatively small number of popular musical tracks, Amped 2 has a gargantuan number of smaller independent bands. The first game also took this route and we're happy to see the tradition carried on. Having a large number of smaller bands not only exposes gamers to a variety of music, but the sheer diversity in music helps the soundtrack stay fresher longer (sounds like bad slogan for a feminine hygiene product, doesn't it?). The genres covered include electronica, emo, hardcore, rap/hip-hop, rock, sak, reggae, and surf rock.   Of course, also like the original game, you can use any of your own music CDs to create a custom soundtrack of your liking. Personally, we prefer boarding to bands like Cat Power, Low, and Wheat because the slowed tempo of the music provides a nice contrast to the quick and frantic gameplay. But that's just us.       The remainder of the audio consists of the board's sounds as it slides through powder and grinds on rails. The effects are done well and do a great job of furthering the feeling of shooting down the side of a 45 degree mountain.   Also, there is a bit of voice acting in the game that belongs to random boarders/photographers on the mountain. Sadly, these voices get annoying very quickly, but you can turn them all the way down in the options menu. Additionally, the surround sound in Amped 2 is fantastic, with accurate spatial positioning and audio cues. If you're a fan of the original Amped, then you should feel right at home with this game. The improved controls and added gameplay elements only make the game less frustrating and more fun. The course designs are also excellent, providing a little bit of everything on each mountain. And then you have excellent graphics and the Live functionality which is well-implemented and is blast to play. Is there room for improvement? Sure. We'd like to see more in-depth character creation, and the controls could still be a tweaked a little (as could the difficulty) but as is, this is one of the best snowboarding games on the Xbox. And it's the only one that's online.But Amped 2 is not for everyone. If you're more of an SSX fan, then the more realistic physics and trick system may not be enough for you. Still, everyone should give Amped 2 a try regardless of preference - you may be surprised at what you find.", "date": "Oct 29, 2003"}
