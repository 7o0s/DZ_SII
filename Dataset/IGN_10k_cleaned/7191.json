Disaster looms for the player that downloads the wrong one, because their expectations of a Madden game will be smashed and trashed. And that terrible edition is the 2D version, which was obviously a complete afterthought at EA Mobile. Developed by Humagade for the software titan, Madden NFL 07 2D is a pedestrian football game that offers little of the Madden magic and dull presentation. It's almost like this game stepped out of a time warp from 2003.   Madden NFL 07 2D was tested on two handsets: the LG Fusic on Sprint and a Sony Ericsson S710a on Cingular. The latter handset is capable of 3D, but the carrier is saddled with the 2D Java download. The title screen is all Madden, but as soon as you cross over into the menu and front end, you know something's up. It's silent. No noise whatsoever. The options you would expect are all present, though, such as a quick game, season mode, help, etc.   Season mode takes you though an entire 16-game season en route to the Super Bowl. Since the game utilizes a full NFL license, you have every league team at your fingertips (each with individual stats like offense and defense), including real-life players. This lets you play right alongside your favorite team as the actual season takes hold on TV. Quick play is a fast match-up between two random teams. Play Now lets you at least choose your team and your opponent, but its strictly an exhibition match.   Once you get into the game, you'll be surprised by the spartan presentation. Cosmetically, Madden NFL 07 2D is unattractive. The field is laid out in vectors, like those old arcade games -- and that's the entire field. The goal posts? Austere yellow lines sticking up out of a texture-less sea of green. The way the camera hangs overhead and swoops over to follow the action reveals plenty of off-field real estate, but nothing's there -- just more flat green. The ultra-tiny players have no detail to them, just bundles of pixels roughly shaped like football players with just a few color swatches to mimic real world team colors. The playbook is lifeless. This detail, to me, exemplifies how little care seemingly went into the game: You can actually see the black square behind the scanned quarter used for the coin toss. Nobody bothered to match up the coin background with the menu screen background.   The presentation affects game play, too. As mentioned, the playbook is dull, showing minimal information on how your selected plays will really play out in once the action starts. Since the playbook graphics are so weak, the game could have at least given you a recommended play. As it is, you'll be scrolling through offensive and defensive plays that don't look all that dissimilar to each other. Where's the great playbook menu system found in JAMDAT's old NFL games? Those were great playbooks! Why the step backwards?   When playing on offense, there are no color tags to show which players are open and which are likely to result in an incomplete pass -- another step backwards. Every receiver is painted with an ugly yellow with a small icon over their head to show which key they are assigned to. Moving the ball down field no longer feels like a science, it just feels like a crapshoot. You can adjust the difficulty from the main menu, from rookie to all-pro. Rookie is a cakewalk, which helps make up for the difficult passing game. All-pro is just mean. Ball after ball is batted to the field -- and this is when the color tags would have been extremely useful. After all, we're not dealing in excess screen space here. You have to give the user something to help out, especially when you have 22 little man-blocks rushing around. This isn't like the Xbox edition where you can physically see just who is open and for how long.   On defense, you use the * and # keys to change the active player. You have to rely on the AI to fill in the holes, and needless to say, it doesn't do a very good job. The only option you have with your selected player is to tackle, and when the players cluster together, seeing your man in the madness is a major chore. Everybody loves to play offense anyway, but I truly dreaded each interception or touchdown, just because I dreaded trying to control my defensive players -- whether they were on-screen in the pixel storm or lingering off-screen while I fussed with the controls. (The controls, actually, are pretty standard -- so established mobile football fans won't stumble too bad if they know their handset number pad -- and didn't feel broken.)  Madden NFL 07 2D doesn't look or feel like an EA Mobile game -- and I know that JAMDAT would have never released something like this. JAMDAT had a great 2D football game -- EA Mobile would have been better off updating rosters and re-skinning it for 07. This game is a mess and any Madden fan is bound to be extremely disappointed with their purchase -- the kind of disappointment that leads to never downloading a game again. This is a let-down and a bad call for all involved. If you're dead set on getting Madden for your cell phone, consider a handset upgrade so you can get the 3D edition. Not only will you get the better mobile Madden, but you can also peek into the increasingly exciting landscape of 3D mobile games.", "date": "Sep 6, 2006"}
