Much to our dismay and to fans of the legendary actor and martial artist, Bruce Lee has arrived on the Xbox in name only. Backed by extremely clunky control, poor graphics and virtually none of the thrills and action that made him famous in real life, QOTD disappoints because it seems as if it really never had a chance to get on track.  The Features   30 lush, 3D, hyper-detailed environments set in real world locations like San Francisco and Hong Kong. Engage multiple opponents ~Bruce Lee-style~ with an enemy lock-on targeting system. More than 30 different enemies each with its own complex AI routines Enemies  work together to surprise, surround and ambush the player. Punch, Kick, Block and Special Attack with more than 100 moves in Jeet Kune Do, motion-captured from Bruce Lees last student. Innovative Move Upgrade System where players purchase new moves from the tokens earned after enemies are defeated.   Gameplay  Fans of Final Fight will recognize the fighting style of QOTD, but even this familiarity won't help you with the control scheme. In fact, the combination of unintuitive controls and tons of technical and graphical glitches had me convinced that we had an early rough version of the game. No final copy of any game should be this raw and unpolished where pressing buttons and moving the D-pad or analog stick may or may not get you a response.   You can either fight enemies freestyle by simply aiming and attacking in their direction or locking onto them. The left trigger locks Bruce onto an enemy and you can cycle through all enemies on the screen through repeated trigger pulls. Once locked on, up on the D-pad or left analog stick moves Lee closer to the enemy, down moves him away and left/right circles the enemy in that direction. You start off with a very basic collection of attacks using the A and B buttons but once you buy new moves with the money you earn from fallen enemies you've smashed, you'll have quite an arsenal of unique Jeet Kune Do moves.   Even with all of these moves at your disposal however, Quest of the Dragon never really breaks though to that Bruce Lee experience we've always wanted. The control scheme we described above is how things are supposed to work. What actually ends up happening is frantic button mashing, not for the sake of speed, but to simply get Bruce to throw the move you want when you want it. The enemies are aggressive enough that they'll gain a huge advantage and land several combos on you if you're too slow to the punch. You can see the problems you'll run into when you're entering commands that aren't being executed in a timely manner. It's not just in combat moves either. There will be times where Bruce won't even want to walk in a direction unless you double mash and re-affirm your wishes to get him walking. He's Bruce Lee not a stubborn mule.   Enhancing the frustration is the great but poorly executed idea of using the right analog stick to duplicate Bruce Lee's multiple-opponent fighting style. Whether you're engaged with an enemy or not, you can always throw a punch or other move either behind him or to the left and right of the direction Bruce is facing by tapping in that direction on the right analog stick. That is, if you're whooping some chump with a flurry of punches and his buddy is sneaking up behind you a quick press on the right analog towards that sneaking enemy will throw a lighting quick no-look punch just like we used to see in the movies. Awesome when it works, but it's not anything that you can rely on because it suffers from the same lag issues as every other fighting move.   Most of the game's other mechanics, like the iron fist attacks and tantalizing nunchaku moves are rendered useless since the fighting engine is so flawed. Lee is supposed to be on a quest to find his father and the golden relic, but he'd be better off trying to find a decent fighting engine somewhere so he can once again kick ass like he used to in the 1970s.  Graphics  Quest of the Dragon looks nothing like an Xbox game. The N64 and PSX could've presented this game's graphics given enough development time. The lighting effects are almost an insult to the Xbox's graphics processor. Rather than truly lighting environments, the development team seemed to prefer simulating all of the effects so that lens flare ends up looking like a giant firefly in broad daylight.   Bruce Lee's fighting animations are decent but nothing that reminds you that you're playing an Xbox game. You'll be able to recognize a jumping reverse roundhouse kick versus a spinning back punch but neither will be too terribly exciting. The jerkiness of the animations is also extremely irritating, but it's difficult to tell whether it's caused by the horrible control or if they're just plain jerky.  The automatic smart camera system is so overmatched that at times it seems to simply give up and stay in one spot out of convenience. At one point, I had Bruce extremely low on health with a boss battle coming up. When the animation for the boss' introduction ended, the camera got locked in a position that can only be described as limbo. But the game continued, Bruce got KO'd and the camera just sat there looking at the corner where the plain, poorly lit ceiling and un-textured, lifeless wall meet.  Sound  The voice samples and voice acting are well done. Which is a nice surprise when you consider how the rest of the game fell apart. Bruce's battle sounds are varied and connected to certain moves. The higher pitched sounds and yelps tend to come with his quick hand strikes and other lightning moves. They've jammed a few lines from Bruce Lee's movie characters into this game as well and the sound quality is better than you'd expect.   No surround sound to speak of which isn't necessarily bad because there's no tradition of immersing sound in a fighting game just yet.   The music is good but could've been so much better. The theme from Enter the Dragon has been licensed for use in Microsoft Games Studios upcoming Kung Fu Chaos but we can't even get a little ~Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting~ into a Bruce Lee game? What kind of nonsense is that? Oh wait, KFC has that Carl Douglas song too, that's what kind it is. I tried to prepare myself and everybody else for the possibility of Bruce Lee getting the super hero treatment, ala Superman 64, a few months ago. To me Lee was superhuman capable of doing things that most of us can only dream about, yet somehow the equally fantastic world of videogames once again has crushed that legacy.The premise of an adventure-fighting game featuring the likeness of Bruce Lee is still exciting, but this effort by Ronin Entertainment and the fact that this game will likely sell well anyways, makes me wish we could rewind time and give somebody the chance to do it right. There's nothing redeeming about this game other than the picture of Bruce Lee on the cover. That should be valuable to memorabilia collectors, but the rest of you shouldn't even think about buying or renting this title.", "date": "Jul 2, 2002"}
