Yes, there is a litany of soccer fans here, but by comparison to say, England, France, Brazil, heck, any place, Cameroon, Niger, the support for professional soccer simply pales in comparison in the world. Soccer is definitely growing in the US, however, and each and every year the major publishers take a stab at improving their games on a multitude of systems in addition to capitalizing on the growing popularity of the professional sport. Starting with its excellent rendition of International Superstar Soccer on Nintendo 64 in 1997, Konami has soared like a comet into the scene and has slowly cut into Electronic Arts' FIFA series grip on the sport (though it's still established in the top ranks across the world). But if you speak with a dedicated, life-long videogame soccer fan anywhere but in the US (with a few exceptions), they'll tell you that Konami's game is the one to beat.    Following the minimalist ESPN MLS Extra Time on PS2 in April 2001, which catered to US ESPN presentation trends and which lacked the options, depth and gameplay of its European counterparts, this year's Winning Eleven Six International betters its predecessor in numerous ways. As a side note, it should be known that Konami is a strange bird when it comes to soccer. This version of the game is a tweaked rendition ofPro Evolution Soccer 2, which is in turn an altered version of Winning Eleven Six, which hit Japan some months back. You could call this Winning Eleven 6.5, and that would be right, sort of, but Konami tweaks each version for the territory, so they're all different in strange and slightly illogical ways. But in the end, what's important is that this 11-on-11 beast delivers an excellent game of soccer, and that it does, that it does.   Gameplay  According to Konami, the game of soccer is a straight-on simulation design. It's not based on arcade-style play. The closer to the way professional soccer players kick, slide, sprint and leap, the better. What this translates to is a game that places a high importance on timely passing, strategic formation and pure gaming skill. You're not likely to sprint down the pitch, faking and juking like Maradona, and slam one in. That's FIFA. In fact, newbies to the game will find that they're not scoring very much at first, or in fact, at all. Games often end up in 1-0 or 2-1 finales. This is a game designed as a simulation and then tweaked and tuned to be fun, slightly forgiving and of course, well balanced.   Despite its less than perfect graphic appeal and slightly cumbersome menu interface, Winning Eleven Six International plays beautifully. The controls are simple and intuitive, yet there's an amazing level of layered depth that goes beyond the initial level. The game is superbly designed to create plays naturally, using crosses and pass-throughs, and it boasts an enormous sense of finesse while dribbling or vying for an opponent controlled ball. The controls are as follows, X for pass, Square for shooting, Circle for lobbing/crossing, with R1 as sprint, and L1 used to enact more complex moves (like lobs, ground passes, etc.). On defense, players use X or Square to defend closely, a nice newer touch to the game, and Circle to slide tackle. The goalie is automatically controlled, except for goal kicks and shootouts. In shootouts, it's just Triangle and a direction. Like I said before, the controls are great, and if you haven't used them before, it only takes a few minutes to get going.   However, technically, the game delivers a subtle style of soccer that might be easy to learn, but it takes a lot of time to master. Players probably won't score in their first game, which is why we strongly recommend playing through the tutorial before jumping into a season. The controls are very sensitive, especially the shooting controls. One can master them, and they're well balanced, but it takes a long time to learn how to keep a ball on the ground during a shot, which can be frustrating to the newcomer and in the heat of a moment, a little frustrating. Slamming the shot button is more akin to a football field goal, not a soccer shot. Even moderately hitting down the shot button often results in a monster kick. This isn't a matter of poor control; rather it's a matter of learning to grow accustomed to the game's subtleties.     Several other changes improve Winning Eleven Six International. The pace of the game has slowed down a bit; varying running speeds are properly brought into the game. In the old PS one games, fast players such as Brazil's Roberto Carlos could basically run around the pitch and go past 99% of the defenders due to his speed. Over the years, Konami has opted to change this, so that slower defenders could snag players with fast running attributes. This became annoying and took some of the shine off the attacking gameplay. In Winning Eleven Six International, Konami has achieved great balance between player speeds, and the combination of new animations helps to create this balance visually. For instance, if you run with the ball utilizing a fast player and have gained some momentum, the slower defenders will have problems stopping you. They'll try to bump you off the ball and both players use their arms to push each other away in a very realistic manner. While battling for the ball like this for dozens of yards doesn't look that realistic, the system still works well. Skilled attacking players can shake off defenders and leave them in their wake or try to dribble around them.    The slower pace of the game helps the dribbling aspect. The Winning Eleven/Pro Evolution Soccer series has always been notable for giving players the ability to create great plays and moves. One can hold onto the ball for a while now instead of having to kick it all over the pitch as the defensive team unrealistically runs to each attacking player trying to steal it. The slower pace and improved dribbling enables skilled players like Zidane to weave through a few opposing players with great skill and make great passes even under pressure. This doesn't mean it's always possible to perform Maradona-style runs all the time because the defending play also has been improved, but not losing the ball as soon as you hit an opposing player has a drastic, positive impact on gameplay. Sometimes the ball can bounce to your advantage and sometimes it doesn't.   Crossing has reached a new height of balance and beauty. It's possible to reach a forward player on the edge of an offside position only for him to escape the defenders and streak toward the goalie one on one. Also, good passing players can accurately make long high passes straight into the path of running players. In general, the passing has been improved. Through-balls work far better than before. If you have a player that can pass the ball well, it's now possible to put the ball straight in front of the feet of your advancing forward while he's in the middle of defenders.    Shooting also harkens back to the old days. While I mentioned that shooting is a skill that requires a good dose of patience and time spent playing, when you do learn it, it's excellent. You can unleash seriously powerful drives just outside the goalie box that seem to rip the goal's net right off the crossbars. It's quite difficult to score with long shots, however, which again reinforces players the need to put in some serious time before growing really good. Even if it's still strangely difficult to hit a target when you're facing the center of the goal, all in all, the shooting element of Winning Eleven Six International is well done.   The AI is tough. AI-controlled teams are deadly in their set pieces. It's not a good idea to give Rivaldo or Beckham a chance to try and score from a free kick near the penalty area. While the defender AI has in general improved, there's still an occasional problem with the center fullbacks. They often allow a midfield player the chance to run straight into the box as neither of them move in to block until it's too late. Also, it's a bit too easy and common to keep hold of the ball in the opposing teams penalty area, it's just a bit unrealistic and hard to defend against. The goalkeepers have gained many new animations and are certainly the toughest they have ever been in the series. You'll feel great relief in these goalies, as they block high and corner shots and they seem to make the best, most logical plays toward the ball. The only case when the goalies seemed to perform poorly is when the attacking team is in a one-on-one situation. In these cases, they tend to come straight out of the goalie box, leaving a lot of opportunity for attackers to score. The solution, of course, is never to let the attacking team in that situation.   The game offers a substantial set modes. It includes Match League, League Mode, Cup Mode, Master League Mode, Training Mode or Edit mode. There is a phenomenal amount of customization players can become involved in, from tooling their leagues, their players looks and gear, their formations, and the like. I don't care much for the menu system, which is designed more like an old IBM operating system that a game front end, but if you can navigate through these things successfully, you're be able to truly customize your game.    Additionally, what's great about this game is that you can play against, at maximum, as many as seven other players. Using two multitaps it can indeed be done. Players can vie head to head, in one-on-one matches, or team up to play cooperatively. A good one-on-one game is excellent fun, and a two-on-two game provides an even deeper feeling of depth, competition and challenge.     Graphics  While the gameplay is superb, for whatever reason, the visuals in Winning Eleven Six International aren't as sharp as their Japanese or European counterparts. Let me break it into pieces for you. The animations are smooth and excellent, the ball physics are outright superb, and the replays, CG, and intros are all well done, right down to confetti filled stadia. It's just that the in-game visuals suffer a bit due to some pretty consistent slowdown and a lack of visual detail. To be fair, the visual detail is hardest hit when the camera is pulled back. Angles such as Wide and Normal Long make the players look generic and anonymous. But it doesn't speed up the graphics. Bringing the game to a Normal Short perspective will show you how this version actually looks.    Up close, many of the players look like their real-life counterparts. The facial models are good, and if you are a soccer fan you'll instantly recognize your favorites by their hair, facial structure and eye color. You can particularly see the facial details in the in-game cutscenes, and in the closer camera angles.    The animation is where the real magic is.  They're more complex than before, and they're a surprisingly good many new moves that one wouldn't realize were missing until after spending some quality time with the game. Goalkeepers tip the ball over the bar, throw their hands up to signal that the ball is going over the goal, stop making a dive when they see the ball going past the goal and so on. The new animations are small, but there are loads of them, and they really help to create a well-rounded package.    The stadiums also look utterly fantastic -- all of them. The pitches, especially the actual grass looks a bit more realistic than before, as some of the glass-like shine has eliminated. The fields are just short of magnificent. There's a clear distinction between different types of grass and each surface is quite close to how they look in real life.    Sound  Overall, the sound effects and music are good; not great, but good. The best effects are heard in the roar of the crowd, the solid variety and style of the announcers, and the simple sound of soccer itself -- goalies booting the ball, players sprinting and dribbling, and referee whistles blaring. The music accompanying the introductions is excellent, and the options respectable. You can only switch from stereo to mono, and you can actually tune the audio commentary or simply turn it off. One can switch between English, French, German, Italian or Spanish on the fly too. Announcer Peter Brackley and game analyst Trevor Brooking generally perform an excellent job in the commentary department, with less repetition and smarter things to say than in Konami's last effort.    The only thing that hurts this game's audio section is the incredibly poor tunes that seem to eke out of the speakers during replays and the like. The music bears an incredible resemblance to the cheesy filth that drowned '80s radio listeners 20 years ago. It's incredibly Velveeta. I mean, Madonna's first album was more classy that this stuff (and I actually liked her first album). But the point is, it's synthy dance music at its worst, and pretty much anything but Bill Joel would be better. It must be a Konami thing.While EA strives to maintain its arcade-style of play and simultaneously edge closer in play to Konami's die-hard simulation, Konami's excellent soccer team continues to improve its unrivaled game of ~football.~ I've come to the conclusion, actually I came to it a while back, that the Winning Eleven series isn't for everybody. It's a great game to be sure, and in my opinion, the best soccer game on PS2 hands-down, but it takes time to learn and master its subtleties. It's not quite as open and easy as other soccer games are.  The upside to this, however, is that Winning Eleven 6 International is insanely deep, incredibly polished, and a remarkably intense game of videogame soccer. And you won't find anything that comes close to it on PS2. If you love the game of soccer, and you're willing to try something besides FIFA, then you must own this game. Heck, scratch that: just go buy it now.", "date": "Mar 10, 2003"}
