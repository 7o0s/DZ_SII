Arcana Heart is truly for hardcore fans of 2D fighters, and those fans need to have a basic comprehension of (and passion for, ideally) anime and various character stereotypes therein. This cute and quirky title assembles an all-female cast of fighters and gives you the opportunity to engage in some incredibly complex battles filled with precisely-timed techniques, counters, dashes and magic. Besides a few minor issues here and there, Arcana Heart is definitely worth a look.   But before you run out and purchase a copy -- assuming you belong to the aforementioned category of gamer -- let's take some time and analyze exactly what this title is bringing to the table. Arcana Heart for the PS2 is actually a simple combination of Arcana Heart and Arcana Heart Full!, the former originally at home in Japanese arcades while the latter served as a patch that balanced the power level of certain special techniques, among other things. The game feels very much like other recent 2D fighters and draws inspiration from them. Although I often compare fighting games to Guilty Gear, one of my favorite franchises, the comparison is especially potent here because Arcana Heart does posses stylistic similarities to Arc System Works' renowned series.    As I mentioned above, the real catch with Arcana Heart is the cast: all gals. Each character is based primarily on anime stereotypes and different moe factors. You have the exuberant schoolgirl, quiet samurai, half-demon, battle maid, shrine keeper, ninja and little girl suspended in a massive autonomous blob. All the usual stuff ...   Furthermore, each fighter will take an elemental spirit, or Arcana, into battle -- one that not only compliments the character with an additional move set but often introduces passive buffers and other eccentricities to further diversify the battle mechanics. As I've mentioned in previous coverage, the fact that you can pair up any girl with any of the Arcana is fantastic and always keeps things fresh. Although you can't necessarily customize your fighters in any way, selecting an Arcana still gives the sensation that you're fine tuning your character to your tastes and creating the best possible contestant for the match.   On to the battles. Arcana Heart features one-on-one fights, so don't expect any tag-team action here. You can get things rolling in either the Story, Arcade, Versus or Training Modes, but there's also a Gallery with some bonus content as well. As for the combat itself, I found that Arcana Heart feels somewhat stiffer than other fighters, but this could be due to the shortened lengths of normal character dashes (not homing dashes, which I'll explain shortly).   That'll leave a mark. Attacks A, B and C are mapped to the square, triangle and circle buttons respectively, increasing in power as you go. The X button has a very special purpose. It not only serves as your homing dash button but also is used to execute the majority of the game's recoveries, cancels and throws. Holding down the button will send your character flying towards your opponent, regardless of their position on the screen. Arcana Heart has an impressively huge vertical space and fights can easily take to the sky with a combination of vertical strikes and homing dashes.   I found that most of the mechanics in Arcana Heart were fun and responsive. With all the different characters and Arcana, there are tons of special techniques at your disposal and you'll have to spend a good chunk of your training time memorizing command inputs and timing. Even though recoveries and cancels require a lot of skill, their implementation is very straight forward and players will be able to grasp the concepts in due time. Say, for example, you're hit with a strong attack that sends you flying against the edge of the screen or ~wall.~ Hit X at the right time and your character will gracefully ricochet off the wall and return to the fight with little downtime. Or perhaps you're in the middle of a special move and you want to cancel it and input a second one. Just hit X again and the magic happens. The skill comes more from perfecting one's timing and developing combos, which I thought was satisfying.     Also enjoyable is the diverse character types. Although I certainly would've liked to see a few more straight-forward characters like Heart (the game's ~signature~ fighter) that don't rely on highly specialized gimmicks, there are some truly unorthodox and entertaining play styles included here. For example, the petite Lieselotte Achenbach not only fights on her own but releases a demonic puppet out of a suitcase which can then fight alongside her. You can set markers across the screen and the puppet will attack that location, which can be vicious when used properly. Mix that with some of Lilica's rollerblade moves and Maori's surprising sisters and you'll come across some interesting moments.   Also of note is the game's animation. While perhaps not as sharp or fluid as other titles out there, it certainly looks slick and is definitely easy on the eyes. Characters move and fight with a lot of personality and there are some genuinely cute animations to uncover.    But it would be a grave mistake not to mention the game's inherently Eastern style and approach to character design. The eccentric Japanese flair in this title appears to have been left untouched, with all the voice blurbs and super peppy music still in place. In regards to the characters, I think all of them are ultimately charming. As far as I can tell, there's nothing overtly sexual about the game, so prospective buyers taken aback by the characters' young ages needn't be overly concerned over inappropriate content. There are mildly suggestive moments but nothing offensive.   With all that said, Arcana Heart does have a few issues worth mentioning. As with other fighting games of this type, the barrier of entry is rather high and the complexity of combat can be overwhelming for novice players. While I was eventually able to adapt to the game's overall play style, it definitely took some time to orient myself and it'll take even longer to memorize all the characters' special moves.   As much as I liked the gameplay experience of Arcana Heart, the package as a whole isn't perfect. There's enough to keep you busy for a little while, but the Arcade and Story modes just don't offer much content if you're playing on your own and there's very little to unlock. As far as I can tell, there aren't even any secret characters to discover, which was a disappointment.   Less concerning is the game's forgettable music. The highly Japanese tunes are appropriate, but there's really nothing too riveting at hand. Furthermore, the game's menu system and overall presentation could be a bit cleaner looking, but it's fine as is. I also found that matches can take a bit too long to load, which can obviously grow tiresome during extended play sessions.   Power of the Arcana. And of course, Arcana Heart is only for the hardcore audience that fancies anime and cute, pink stuff. I wouldn't recommend it to a mainstream gamer.For the most part, Arcana Heart is awesome and offers yet another avenue for fighting game enthusiasts to tread. After recently playing the robust Super Smash Bros. Brawl, the amount of bonus content included on this PS2 disc (an art gallery, a few movies, some forgettable music, etc.) seems really sparse, but at least it's something. Otherwise, a charming cast, great fight mechanics, diverse play styles and tons of depth make this a fighting game you don't want to miss. Despite its few problems, you only have to pay thirty dollars for a fantastic experience.", "date": "Apr 4, 2008"}
