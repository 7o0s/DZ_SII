EverQuest is, for better or worse, the standard of MMO games--a highly successful franchise with a Sims-sized library of expansion packs that was large enough to break into mainstream pop culture and stay there. The whole while, real-time strategy gaming has been a healthy and steadily evolving genre, so one might even wonder why EQ didn't branch out sooner. In fact, it's too bad it didn't, because Lords of EverQuest carries with it many kludgy elements that current RTSs have cut away. While Lords might have done quite well a few years ago, gamers have become accustomed to a more honed experience.  There is a back story, and it is a little strange to delve into one, since it's being created almost from whole cloth, as EverQuest (the MMO) is a player-driven universe rather than a story-driven one. A vengeful and appropriately ugly enemy has risen up against the appropriately shiny good guys, and you'll be wading through a dozen maps per campaign in order to get to the bottom of the trouble. To be fair, it's not as cut-and-dry as it sounds, as you are able to actually play the ugly guys in one of the campaigns, and you can even start any of the three campaigns at any time, rather than them being strung together like in StarCraft and Warcraft.  Thankfully, Lords avoids the usually tiresome churn of ~Build base, build troops, move troops, destroy enemy base~ that can bring the fun factor to a grinding halt after a few tries (although it is certainly more fun more unpredictable in multiplayer). However, Lords seems to veer almost self-consciously away from this model, often leaving you to adventure game-type scenarios where you're wandering around the map gathering imprisoned allies or escorting VIPs.  Sometimes you have the opportunity to build up your troops before you go a-huntin', but it's a frustratingly slow experience. You can queue up units to be built and set a waypoint for them to automatically go to, but it takes a freakin' long time to squeeze a guy out. Although the only resource you require is platinum, it will usually be in short supply. You'll often just run out of money before you run out of patience. There might be other platinum mines scattered through the map, but that's a long trek for your peasant unit--unless you have enough money to build another HQ right by the mine.   Lords has the familiar building tree, where you can create a Hall of Uber Killingness until you've built a couple lesser buildings before it (and kept those buildings standing). And each unit-producing building allows you to buy an upgrade that enhances that unit's attack or defense in some way. The headquarters for each faction also offers a unique upgrade. The Alliance Oupost of the Elddar Alliance, for example, can let you upgrade your troops to heal faster than usual.  This can be a sticking point for some players, actually. When you can heal all your troops by just sitting around long enough (as long as you're not on a timed map, more on that gem in a minute), it makes for some unexpected and sometimes dramatic lowering of the difficulty. While this may make the game more accessible to the casual player (and Lords will likely get picked up by many on name recognition alone), it will strike the RTS fan as unbalanced. It can also be frustrating in multiplayer, when someone can just keep on running away from you and come back to poke at you guerilla-style. This tactic only prolongs a successful war of attrition, rather than adding a new dimension to the experience.     But there are bigger issues. Let's get back the rescue and escort missions I mentioned earlier. There's a mission for the Dawn Brotherhood where you have to rescue a dozen soldiers and get them all to a dock alive, or the mission fails. There's a timer on it, but it's doable if you don't dilly-dally. You might be tempted to stick around and kill some extra enemies or destroy some extra buildings, since your units gain experience and get stat boosts--which are invisible, by the way. But you're better off sometimes not leveling up your troops, because when you migrate them to the next mission, you have to ~buy~ each unit you want to take with you, using limited funds. This prevents you from ending up with a horde of troops by the end of the campaign--but then so would balanced and consistent difficulty.  Anyway, when you're rescuing these unarmed soldiers, you have to make sure all dozen stay alive. When I first played through, I didn't realize they weren't armed, and lumped them in with the rest of my troops. Now, things can get hectic in battle. It's difficult to keep up with the healing, and some units will get pinned down. The thing is, one of these soldiers I was supposed to rescue went down--and the mission didn't end. I was like, ~Okay, I guess as long as I get most of them to the dock, I'll successfully complete the mission.~ So I get to the dock, and the timer is winding down, and the soldiers are boarding the ship--but one is missing. ~11 of 12 have boarded the ship.~ I look around the map. Nope, everyone is here. Oh, wait! I guess I've just been wandering around fruitlessly for the past ten minutes and have to go back and find a saved game from before he went down, whenever that was!   You'll also have to escort this one humanoid wolf character who's pretty important to the war effort. Usually, with other games, you can add this person to your party, or they will at least automatically follow whoever is the designated leader. Not so here! Instead of doing either of these things, Wolfy, just ran away to where we were supposed to go, past several packs of enemies. If Wolfy (not his real name, I changed it to protect the innocent) had died, the mission would have been over. But it was okay, because the enemies never turned to attack him, even when he ran right past them. These enemies, however, certainly weren't as hesitant to descend on my little band of troops.    The allies under computer control will not be attacked by an enemy, apparently, unless it's scripted into the story of the campaign. So you can imagine my excitement, then my frustration, when I band together with an ally to take on a common enemy, only to have a third or half of my troops cut down by the time we get there--while my ally's party hasn't gotten so much as a scratch. If that isn't enough, ranged units at a choke point can block friendly units behind them trying to get to the action, and everyone is set on suicidal aggression.  It's odd to find these glitches in such fundamental RTS scenarios. But there are other elements too where it feels like not enough time was spent. For example, there's the graphics. Lords can scale up to 1600x1200, and ran without any lockups or crashes, but it never quite breaks free of looking and feeling like a Warcraft III mod, a game which a lot of people found pretty blocky when it came out a year and a half ago, at least initially. And Warcraft III still had some amazing unit detail and animation going for it, while the units here have some decidedly blurry textures, for the most part.      Where the character models a low number of polygons and therefore more flat surfaces, the blurry textures are especially noticeable. So most of the guys wearing armor are best seen from farthest back. However, the Gaz Warrior frog people have well-defined musculature even on close inspection and look pretty awesome at any distance. Camera control is actually quite smooth and intuitive. Just hold down the middle mouse button and you can move the mouse left and right to rotate, and back and forth to zoom in and out. Since Lords is overwhelmingly more tactical than strategic, however, you'll usually be looking at things from farthest out. So the relatively blurry unit textures and blocky models aren't a letdown most of the time.  Unfortunately, all in-game cutscenes are done cinematically, with the unit close enough to take up the whole screen. Since the principle characters almost all wear armor, and there's no motion capture, and no facial movement, you feel like you're watching a puppeteer stage, and it doesn't look so hot. The animation in these scenes consists mostly of nodding rapidly and awkward arm movements.  The audio fares better in many respects, but fails in one key spot. First of all, we have some great Hollywood voice talent behind the principle characters. Some of them might be faces you'd recognize but names you wouldn't, but you have John Rhys-Davies (Gimli in the Lord of the Rings movies), Kate Mulgrew (the captain in Star Trek: Voyager) Ron Perlman, Michael T. Weiss (the star of Pretender) Fairuza Balk, and the warm rumblings of Keith David, who voiced Spawn in the HBO series.  While they all do a uniformly excellent job, there's a problem with generic unit commentary. Every time you click on a destination, a unit will utter one of two lines. Every single time you click for them to go somewhere. Often, a game has a slider to control this specific bit. However, in Lords, this slider is also tied to unit sound effects. If you want to mute the constant repetitive chattering, you also have to silence all combat. This also has the side effect of muting all cutscene dialog, although you will get subtitles. But that's a decidedly unsatisfying tradeoff.    The multiplayer experience is pretty solid, however. Sony offers SOEGames.net, a free online service that allows you to host or join a game for free, and provides matchmaking and rankings. When choosing a map to host, you'll be shown the maximum number of players for each one, and you can also password protect your game. There's also a healthy variety of victory conditions, including one called Body Harvest, where the winner has to eliminate the most enemy units in a certain amount of time, and Lord of Levels, where the winner is the one who's Lord (the Heroes of Might and Magic-style commander unit) has gained the most levels under a certain time limit. You'd think a budget-laden group like SOE could have taken its time to create a truly compelling and lasting experience as it has with EverQuest. However, in apparently going for as much mainstream appeal as possible, they've let core elements go by the wayside. Eliminating all resources but money allows for more focus on combat--but combat isn't all that interesting. And units take a long time to create, and a long time to kill. This wouldn't be so noticeable if you were more busied with gathering other resources, building things, and scouting the enemy. In the end, Lords will probably sell on name recognition alone, but hopefully it's mediocrity and irritating design decisions won't lower the bar for others.", "date": "Dec 5, 2003"}
