Do we need another? Ion Storm thinks we do and has delivered its own take on the genre with the frighteningly-titled Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3.   So what does Dominion add to the genre? Not much. In fact, this game is probably the most generic real-time strategy title to hit the PC yet. It's almost identical in play to Command & Conquer, except this time, it's aliens at war instead of humans. In fact, there are four different races of aliens, but unfortunately, the only real differences between them seem to be their video cut sequences. Sure, each race has its own set of vehicles and soldiers, but they're so similar, it's almost a game in itself to spot the differences.   Like most of the real-time strategy games of late, you to harvest resources for funds. In this case, you just need to plop a refinery on top of a small well and it does the work for you. Sadly, the refinery has an odd shape, and if you accidentally place other structures too close to the well, you're screwed. Even if it looks like it fits, in some cases, the interface just won't let you place it. In this case, you just have to start the mission over. Sure you can sell the structures to make room, but that puts you at a disadvantage for the rest of the game.  The dated graphics improve slightly with an increase in resolution  (up to 1280x1024 if your system can handle it), but the tile set used for the landscape is not only bland but also downright boring. Bumping the resolution up doesn't necessarily make it easy to see the tiny icons of the troops, either. Worse still, the game's admittedly well-produced, full-motion video sequences are used over and over again until you want to scream as soon as they show up.  Where these games usually shine is in their multiplayer aspects, and even here Dominion disappoints. The game boils down to who can find a well first and get their large group of troops to their opponent's base. The challenge of creating a powerful fortress of the other games in the genre just isn't here -- it's simply a race to become a mob in Dominion.   This game doesn't bode well for the overhyped Ion Storm -- an extremely generic game such as Dominion has no place on the roster of a company that claims it will revolutionize the PC market with its original product. This game is the first strike against the fledgling development house.  -- Craig Harris", "date": "Aug 1, 1998"}
