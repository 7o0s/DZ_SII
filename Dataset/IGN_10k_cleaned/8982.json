The emphasis on that last part of the equation. There is no halfway on the movie sets of Stuntman -- you must hit every single mark to please the director and move on to the next stage. Even though you get a point-by-point run-through of the stunt course before each take, there is still a considerable degree of trial and error. Mercifully, the tracks are short enough that a failed run only swallows a minute of your life.   Stuntman is something of a finesse game. You must coax, push, and tease your vehicle through 27 action-filled stages in three different movies. In some stages, you're perfecting an arc over actors so they don't get hurt. In another, you're fleeing from another car. The next stage has to breaking massive air, shooting into the sky and pulling off daring flips. You're charged with hitting specific obstacles. Some levels combine all of these stunts and throw in things like helicopters.   As you race through the stunts, you must collect stars of varying sizes. These stars boost your fame, which in turns fills your tank with nitro. Use the nitro to blast over obstacles or skirt ahead of vehicles in pursuit. Learning when you use and when to conserve is a big part of Stuntman's puzzle-like play.   Stuntman quickly becomes a cruel mistress. If you devote yourself to it, you're in for a lot of frustration and teeth-gnashing. But when you finally unlock the perfect run, hitting all of your marks, there is a real satisfaction to crossing the finish line. You earn that gold medal and new stages open up for you to rip through. This give-and-take formula was fine during the first of the three movies. However, somewhere during the second film, the rule of diminishing returns kicked in. Landing a flip and scooting to the end point was more of a relief than a joy. The stunts were more elaborate and the stakes were higher, but all the intro tour elicited was a shallow groan.   Ignition includes a freestyle mode for just goofing on the courses you've already completed in your career. There is also a two-player mode called Co-star Challenge. You pass the phone back and forth, racking up big air, hitting stunts, and collecting stars.   The controls are quite solid -- no qualms here. You can use either the number pad or the directional pad. I had no problems with just using the d-pad. The production values aren't necessarily Stuntman's strong suit, but they are passable. The replay mode is a nice addition, though, but I suspect it will go largely unused since the smallest screen certainly drains some of the epic-ness of the big stunts. Perfectionists might enjoy taming Stuntman Ignition, but I come to mobile for quick fixes of fun. The back half of the game doesn't offer this. If you're curious enough to still give it a try -- which is wholly understandable, because being a stuntman always sounds cool -- definitely download it via a subscription. That way, when you start pulling your hair out, you're just doing it because you failed a run, not because you juiced your cell bill by six bones.", "date": "Sep 5, 2007"}
