I'm fine with the whole killing thing; I just don't seem to have the patience to keep the killing to a minimum acceptable level. If I can save three minutes by killing a guy, I'll probably do it. Such is the verdict at least of a week's worth of playing Eidos' Hitman 2, the follow up to one of the better-conceived games of 2000.   But while the original had some really interesting ideas, the actual implementation of those ideas fell short in a few key areas. Thankfully, the sequel fixes virtually everything that was wrong with the first game and preserves everything that we liked. Better still, the game doesn't take the fact that I'm an impatient hitman seriously enough that it keeps me from enjoying myself.   For those of you who are just joining us, Hitman 2 puts you in the role of Agent 47, an assassin for hire, and sends you all over the world performing murders for hire. But things don't start like that. The hitman, codenamed 47, has had a change of heart and repented from his evil ways and is now living in a monastery. Without giving it away, circumstances call him back in to action.   Soon he's in the midst of a dangerous world where he himself is often the most dangerous element. Hired to kill for money, he travels to various locations around the globe performing a series of seemingly unconnected hits that gradually come together to form a larger picture. Along the way, you can take many different approaches to your contracts. As long as the guy you're supposed to kill winds up dead, no one's in a position to complain.   To a large extent, that's the real beauty of Hitman 2. While Thief is a great game, the fact that you have to use stealth gives it a limitation (albeit a compelling one) that Hitman 2 doesn't have. Instead, Hitman 2 lets you play either blatantly excessive or artfully efficient in terms of violence and confrontation. Sure, most missions offer substantial rewards for the inconvenience inherent in sneaking around, but few of them categorically restrict the player to this approach. Given the practical benefits of going in with guns blazing, how you progress through a level is more a matter of taste than a matter of mission scripting.   That simply philosophy is apparent at all levels -- from the game's core concept to the execution of the smallest tasks. Since Dan played a great deal of the game for our previews, we've been sharing a lot of our experiences with each other. In nearly every case, I'm amazed that we've both come up with drastically different yet equally effective solutions to the same missions. Still more impressive is that he and I can have vastly different body counts for successful missions. In some cases, one or the other of us was able to focus on a much less bloody approach than the other.   Like I said, most of my missions were a little too bloody, and there's a greater satisfaction to be found in infiltrating a level, avoiding all the guards, killing your lone target and then getting out again without anyone being the wiser. The game ranks your performance based on the amount of disruption you cause in a given mission. The efficient players will be labeled ~stealth assassins,~ the more reckless ones are likely to be termed ~mass murderers.~ Realistically, you'll wind up in between most of the time, coming across as a simple ~hatchet man~ or ~slayer.~   During the course of the game, you'll have to take on a number of tasks -- that is to say, you'll have to take on the same task (killing a dude) in a number of different circumstances and settings.  You'll have to break in to a penthouse and make your hit look like a burglary. Or you'll have to ice a general who's interrogating a prisoner deep in a military basement. Or place a transmitter on a guy, then kill him so you can track his corpse to the guy you really want to kill, his father.   All of these missions are delivered to you via a laptop in your shed. One would assume that a state-of-the-art hitman would have access to better intelligence than your guy seems to. The large streets maps that you get don't show things like doors or windows or even how many floors a given building has. You get this info for some of the key structures but there are more than a few instances where looking at the map gives you almost no indication of what the level is really like.   As a result, some of the more difficult missions require you to go in and screw things up once or twice before you get a sense of how the various pieces of the puzzle add up to a successful mission. There are also a number of items and triggers that are hard to figure out exactly. Occasionally the game will give you an item (like a cell phone and a pager) without presenting a clear circumstance for its use. I really like the free nature of this approach and the improvisation required to pull it off is kind of fun. Still, it seems like a professional hitman would be a little better prepared before going off on a hit.   There are also some frustrating ambiguities in the mission briefings. In an early mission, you're told that you can pick up your equipment ~near the pier.~ What this actually means is ~complete across the street from the pier behind a dumpster.~ It seems amateurish that your employers aren't clearer about these things. In any case, this is a game that tests how resourceful you are and how quickly you can adapt to changes in the ~plan.~   But even if you figure out a particular path through a level, there are bound to be plenty of others that you didn't try or perhaps weren't even aware of. In one mission where you have to assassinate two men meeting in a park, I fixed it by planting a bomb on one of the guy's cars, and then climbed up a radio tower to snipe the other one. When his friend went down, the other guy raced to his car and boom! Dan, on the other hand, after placing the bomb on the first lime merely waited until the other limo driver went down an alley to take a leak. Dan snuck up and strangled him, switched his clothes and walked back to plant the bomb on the limo himself.   One big (and entirely welcome) change is the addition of a save system. Based on the difficultly level you've chosen, you'll be allotted a certain number of saves for each mission. At the end of the mission, your success rating is dependent on the number of saves you've used. The game also rewards more stealthy players with bonus saves for completing particular tasks without resorting to some sort of bloodbath. Being sneaky also rewards you with extra equipment for subsequent missions.    The game also benefits from a new suspicion meter that lets you know when your behavior is about to set off the guards. Taking the form a small sensor in the upper left of the screen, the meter tells you just how suspicious the guards are of you. Things like walking through an office holding a submachine gun are a dead giveaway but even things like running or entering restricted areas will raise alarms. Disguises help to keep you concealed but much less so than in the previous game. This time, you can't get too close to enemies without them getting apprehensive. ~There's something about that bald-headed, white Muslim guy that doesn't sit right with me, Poona.~   I chuckled a bit when, in the middle of a firefight with four or five guards, I got a message update telling me that the guards were ~looking for a suspicious bald man.~ There's also a bit of humor in shooting someone eight or nine times, then simply stealing their clothes and walking in to a posh party. ~Hey, Svildnark, what were all those gunshots in the kitchen? And why are there bullet holes in your clothes? Oh well, check on the general; it seems there's an assassin in the house.~ There are a few other scripting inconsistencies -- like the driver of a truck patiently waiting for you to kill his guards and then driving you to the secret enemy hideout once he's given you enough time to climb in the bed.   If you are caught (and believe me, sooner or later you will be) you may notice that the detection and alert ranges for the guards are somewhat variable. In a few cases I was able to get away with loudly killing a guard and his buddy down the street didn't notice. Other times, I killed a guard and found every soldier on the whole level suddenly racing to my location. There are also a few eagle-eyed snipers who can nail you before you even get a chance to see where they're shooting.   The game defaults to a third-person perspective with the camera just above and behind your character. While this is a bit of a change for the genre, titles like the original Hitman as well as Max Payne and Mafia have gone a long way to showing PC gamers that it can be a rewarding approach. The camera problems of the first game are almost all eliminated now and you can even scroll the camera in and out a bit with the mouse wheel. The camera also lags behind your character a bit, taking just a second to turn with you when you turn. While this can be a bit of a liability in fast, close fights with the enemies, it keeps the game from seeming too stiff or rigid. For those who can't have it any other way, there's a first-person view available.   While in first-person mode you'll miss out on the personality and liveliness of the Hitman's animations (and his lively facial expressions). You won't miss it in the rest of the game however. The animations and character models are superb, bringing a much-needed sense of life to the folks that need killing. The architecture is also fantastic in all but one or two of the levels. Cities seem to be laid out in a reasonable and believable manner and the interiors are almost always designed with some real functionality in mind. Mansions and underground bases seem natural and there aren't any empty, purposeless rooms.   There are a few details that help add some life to the levels (the birds in the courtyard of the monastery are lots of fun to scare around) but for the most part, the levels aren't filled with people or items that exhibit any real interaction. Oh, sure, the few bystanders will run screaming when you draw your weapons but mostly you'll feel like you're in some sort of military compound where the only people around are guys with guns.   The game also has a few wonderful cinematic sequences at the beginning that really set the mood. Unfortunately, these tend to disappear from the game altogether after the first few missions but the few that are included are really effective and help move the story along without wasting much time.   While you'll need a pretty robust system to take in all that Hitman 2 has to offer, it runs remarkably well on a 500MHz system with a GeForce 2. You won't get all the polish and detail you'd get on a higher machine but with enough RAM, you won't miss much.   The audio work is also well done. More and more games are coming out with professionally produced scores that follow the idioms of traditional classical and movie music. Hitman 2 definitely wins points with us for the music, which is subtle and effective. But it's the voice work that really sells the audio experience. The actor portraying the Hitman has a fantastically cool delivery. Other characters deliver their lines with conviction and skill.   What did you think of Hitman 2: Silent Assassin?   There are those that will complain that the game is too short. While the game doesn't offer the 20- or 30-hour single-player experience that you'd get with most other shooters, the experience here is much tighter overall. Personally, I'm tired of games that wear out their welcome simply for the sake of including ~30 hours of gameplay~ on the sales sheet. In the case of Hitman 2 the game is just long enough to be rewarding and short enough that you can keep the whole story arc in mind as you play.   The downside to that is, of course, that the game seems not to have the same replay value as something like No One Lives Forever 2. But while that's how it appears on the surface, the levels in Hitman 2 allow for so many different approaches, that it's likely that you'll want to play through the single player campaign again to see how efficient you can be. The complete absence of multiplayer is also bound to turn some gamers off but given the lonewolf, stealth-oriented nature of the game, it would be quite difficult to come up with a multiplayer mode that seemed like the rest of the game.  I was watching this show about high school cheerleader tryouts over the weekend. (Actually my wife was watching it, I was more leering.) Anyway, there was this one little spunky kid who wasn't as strong as the other people trying out for the squad. Her technique was a bit weak and she lacked the size and strength of the other girls. But she had a hunger and enthusiasm that made up for her deficiencies and got her a spot on the squad.To me that's what Hitman 2 is like. It's not the best of the shooters that have come out this year but given the competition, that shouldn't be too harsh a criticism. The real issue is that Hitman 2 has the same spirit as that little cheerleader. It may not be at the top of the action genre but the substantial improvements made over the original go a long way in my book.But that's not to dismiss Hitman 2 as simply a most-improved sequel. While the title has significant improvements over the earlier version, it's a phenomenal game in its own right and one that's sure to have broad appeal, particularly among those gamers who like to put a little more thought in to their carnage.", "date": "Oct 7, 2002"}
