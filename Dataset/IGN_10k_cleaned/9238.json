After fighting to avenge his father, destroying the demonic forces of darkness and defeating the evil lord Jacquio, Ryu Hayabusa is flipping out and killing stuff a second time. Because that's what ninja do.   And ninja, plural, is just the right word for this sequel -- because in Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos, Ryu doesn't fight alone. He's joined by two other assassins of the night, who move, jump, climb and attack just like him. Right behind him.   Because they are him. The chief innovation introduced for this side-scrolling action/ platformer sequel was Ryu's all-new power to clone himself, creating orange-colored spirit shadows that followed along behind him and copied his every move. It's an interesting technique to see in action. You start out playing as Ryu alone, defeating enemies and advancing through stages just as expected. But if you find and claim an orange power-up with Ryu's face on it, a Hayabusa doppelganger will immediately appear about five steps behind you on-screen and start doing just what you do.    But more interesting is that while your clone (or clones, because you can get two at once) follows the same path you do running along platforms and climbing ladders, it will also stop when you stop -- even if that means it's left hanging in mid-air. There's a learning curve to being able to effectively take advantage of this fact, but if you overcome the awkwardness of both controlling yourself and the shadow clones behind you, you can position them in ways that make progressing through levels and taking down bosses much easier and quicker.   You'll probably need to take the time to practice, too, because the difficulty level hasn't gotten any lighter since the original Ninja Gaiden. Frustration is still your constant companion as you try to avoid enemies -- mostly inopportune, swooping birds -- and advance to the end of each level. Some stages now feature environmental hazards too, like wind and rain that can blow in your face to impede your jumping ability, or lighting that fades in bursts and leaves you unable to see the platforms you're standing on.   One frustration that's been fixed since Ninja Gaiden 1 is Ryu's wall-clinging ability. In the first game, you could scale sheer walls but only if you jumped, stuck to the wall, then did little short hops away and toward the same vertical surface, again and again, to gain just a little upward ground each time. Here in Ninja Gaiden II, you can just climb straight up any wall by pressing up on the D-Pad after making contact. It's much nicer. And Ryu's got a little better flow to his movements in general, as well, with his overall speed getting upped a notch. It encourages you to run through levels as fast as you can, which you can, if you're good enough.   The only real negative to level against this sequel is that, story-wise, it's not quite as impressive as its predecessor. We praised Ninja Gaiden in its review this past spring for its innovation in storytelling, as it was the first game to progress its plot through the use of cinematic cutscenes. Ninja Gaiden II does that as well, but it just feels a little more generic this time around -- you're trying to save your kidnapped girlfriend, the big bad guy turns out not to be the real, final big bad guy. All kind of predictable.So Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos is a solid ninja-action sequel, and it makes for pure gaming action. The innovations it introduced in gameplay, like the ability to clone yourself and the revision to Ryu's movement and control, feel like a suitable upgrade over the original adventure. The story isn't as revolutionary and the challenge factor is still nearly maddeningly insane, but you should have a good idea of what you're getting into if you've played the original first. And that's our ultimate recommendation.", "date": "Oct 15, 2007"}
