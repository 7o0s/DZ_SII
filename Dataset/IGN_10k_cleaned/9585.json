While that assumption is correct in part, the Altron developed title is actually a lot more. It's also a fast paced sword battler, and talking animal platformer. It's like three games in one! They aren't three very good games, but it does have a bit of charm and appeal for the younger crowd.   Much like the film of the same name, Enchanted has taken multiple elements that are classic to the genre, combined them, and given it a twist. The plot starts off like an extremely generic mashup of a Disney film. The maiden, Giselle, is set to marry Prince Edward, until the evil Queen tries to stop the marriage by making Giselle sleep forever. Oh, and somehow Giselle, Edward, and Pip the talking chipmunk end up getting transported to the real world.   Enchanted is half set in real world New York City, and half set in the animated fantasy world of Andalasia. As the game jumps between each world, the character design switches to match accordingly. Every playable character has both an animated and real life model, and for the most part they're pretty well done. The 3D environments, while limited in the movement department, have large, expansive backgrounds. There's a nice comparison between the animated woodlands of Andalasia, and NYC's Times Square. The character portraits and 3D models definitely don't astound, but they're solid and accurate. The larger movie stills look a little funky with the limited color palette, though.   Each character has a completely different style of gameplay and as the story progresses players get to control each one. None of the game modes are particularly great by themselves, but together the game has an eclectic feel that should appeal to multiple demographics.    You fight multiple varieties of giant blobs in this game. Giselle's levels are primarily exploration based. Players work their way through Andalasia or NYC, finding items, and using friendly animals to complete tasks. It's not the most enthralling part of the game, especially when players are tasked with collecting multiple objects, but it provides a more casual portion in an otherwise action based game. Giselle also makes dresses and other objects in a minigame. Players put the collected materials in a bin, then spin them around real fast in a tub. It's reminiscent of Poffin making in Pokemon Diamond/Pearl and makes the otherwise simple customization section of the game a little more fun.   Prince Edward makes up the bulk of the action in the game. He's on a mission to find Giselle, and has to fight his way to her. The combat system for the game is a touch screen controlled, turn based system. Players tap and swipe various circles and lines to slash, thrust, and guard against villains. By performing well, Edward can power up and perform finishing moves that cause the game to switch to a rather over the top cut scene. It gets a bit repetitive as the game progresses, but a lot of the time the battles can be skipped so players don't have to fight a lot if they're feeling peaceful (or bored). The boss battles go on a bit too long to really be a lot of fun, especially since it's just the same type of combat mechanics as any normal bad guy.   Since no great Disney story is complete without an animal sidekick, Pip the chipmunk also has a role in the game. His levels are rather straightforward platformers that are over in about two minutes. He's really more of a minigame. The few boss battles Pip has are also pretty lame, and hard to control. They take far too long to do relatively simple tasks like jumping on a bus driver's head. It's the low point of the title to try to battle as the chipmunk.Altron makes a pretty decent attempt to try and capture multiple audiences with Enchanted. The game offers multiple types of game play that will appeal to different types of youth. If kids don't like a certain part of the game however, too bad since there is no option to choose what to play, it's all locked to the story. And really the three game types are not really very good. Together they make the game have enough charm almost be a decent title, though it's far from enchanting.", "date": "Nov 20, 2007"}
