Well, that's what you should be expecting from Worms World Party. Worms Armageddon maniacs might be a bit letdown with another ~upgrade~ to the Worms series rather than a ~true~ sequel.  But to those that have yet to fully be engrossed with the tactics and mannerisms of our spineless friends, Worms World Party is a refreshing gameplay experience that recieves marginal improvements over Worms Armageddon.  As stated above, the fundamental gameplay mechanics of Worms haven't changed much with Worms World Party. The premise is very simple; take your worm team and simply annihilate the opposing worm teams on the screen, in this turn-based 2D strategy game.  Woah, wait a second there... a turn-based strategy game in 2D?  Didn't turn based strategy and 2D die years ago?  If that's your attitude, you'll probably be turned off when you initially boot up the game up... shoot, I was when I first saw Worms Armageddon. In a day where gamers want faster gameplay, lots of visual flair, high-frame rates, and high polygon counts, Worms World Party looks like a game lost in the bargain bin.  That is, until you begin to appreciate the unique visual style, hilarious voices, and most of all, deep gameplay that the Worms series has always offered.  There are over 50 items to utilize, hundreds of different strategies to learn, and a vast amount of gameplay mechanics to master (i.e. Ninja Rope), all with the simple goal of defeating opposing worms on your screen.  Viewed from the classic 2D side view, the rules of the game haven't changed at all - either deplete an enemy nightcrawler of it's health, or knock them out of the playing field (in the water or out of the battlefield) until all opposing worms are gone.  Not only do you have a number of weapons at your disposal, but obstacles on the playing field can both help or hinder your elimination of enemy maggots.  For instance, mines will be laid around the field and should an unfortunate worm stand close to a mine it's your ~duty~ to push that worm using an attack, into that mine.  Don't forget oil cans that, when ignited, burst into cloud of flames that will cook any nearby annelid.  Although all this great and cute destruction of worms certainly has it's appeal, what will really hook players onto Worms World Party is trying to find the most efficient way to kill as many worms as possible in the limited amount of time you have.  Being a turn-based game, you're given about 50 seconds total (default settings) to determine what worms you're going to try to kill, plan your attack, and execute it.  To a certain degree, it's not unlike thinking up a Rube Goldberg machine; for example, setting a mine next to a worm will send that worm flying next to another mine, which then explodes next to an oil can, which then sends flames to a oil can below, which then... well, you get the picture.  Add on top of that, the mastery needed in some of the items - especially ninja ropes and bazooka launching - and you've got quite a lot of depth packed into the Worms series of games.  Of course, the main question here is whether Worms World Party improves dramatically over the previous version, Worms Armageddon. There are no visual differences between either version that I can speak of (at least not that I could see enough that it made an impression) and as of right now, I have yet to see any new weapons.  WWP doesn't dramatically alter the gameplay either; the new Wormpot, a slot machine of sorts, allows you to change the rules of each Worms match quickly and easily.  For example, you could select a game with Super Rope mode, increased falling damage, and unarmed attacks do more damage, but for the next game, you could change it so crates drop every round, earthquakes occur every round, and wind effects all weapons.  You still have the ability to customize almost everything including terrain features, objects in the battlefield, customizable maps, and edit the sounds.  That's probably the most appealing feature as I've spent numerous hours looking for old movie sound clips for Worms Armageddon and players will be glad to know the sound format hasn't changed in Worms World Party. Let's also not forget the new missions available for that one player experience and if you can't finish a certain mission, there's a handy new Multiplayer mission feature allowing you to go online and get a buddy to help you out with the mission.   If there's one major gripe I have with Worms World Party, it's with the online play.  When I initially booted up the game for online play, I was informed that I needed to download a patch and that was really surprising.  Given their experience with Worms Armageddon and the fact that this is a turn-based game, how hard could it have been to have online play ready with flaw from the moment you install your box copy onto your computer?  Additionally, online play has still been a bit buggy, as I've been disconnected from games occasionally; although this is nothing new to people that have played on Wormnet, you would think that the online play servers would've been streamlined so ~lagging out~ occurs less.  While I'm pretty sure Worms World Party's online servers will be improved in the future, the game hasn't improved a lot since Worms Armageddon. Players that own Worms Armageddon shouldn't bother with the small changes that comes with Worms World Party but those that haven't experienced the Worms experience should definitely head out to the nearest software store and join the party.  -- Anthony Chau     Want to share your opinions with the world?
