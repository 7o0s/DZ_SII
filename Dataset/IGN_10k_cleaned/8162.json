You must wait, as must we all, even if federal agents are chasing you with weapons set to kill. Such is Otto's plight. Otto is a spy, trained in the art of espionage, an internationally intriguing fellow, dispatched to collect secret documents from an undisclosed skyscraper full of federal foes. He'll have to navigate a maze of hallways, doorways, elevators and escalators while dodging those foes' unfriendly fire, and make it all the way to his getaway car parked, conveniently, right outside the ground floor front door. It's Elevator Action!   Elevator Action is a classic. An arcade game that arrived in the early '80s, in the age when arcades where still the place to be and the place to find the latest and greatest hits. And Elevator Action was a hit, published by Taito, with gameplay so unique and addictive that it earned itself both a follow-up coin-op sequel and an array of home computer and console ports. This 1987 NES edition is one of those. While a small sacrifice was made in converting the graphics, EA's gameplay still works perfectly here. It is, of course, all about the elevators.   You start each stage by infiltrating a skyscraper roof-first, and entering a central elevator that deposits you on the highest floor. You quickly observe that the building is filled with doors -- most of them blue, but some of them red. The red ones are your goal, and you'll hop into and out of lots of the titular up-and-down lifts to get to them. You need to make it to each one of the crimson portals and pass into it briefly, emerging from the room on the other side with a secret document in hand. If you collect every piece of classified paper, you can escape in the getaway car and move to the next stage... but the federal agents won't make it easy.   The black-suited baddies appear from behind closed doors and attack you. You can dodge their gunfire by ducking under or jumping over it, then dispatch them with a shot of your own, or a kick to the face, or by crushing them with one of the elevators should they be stupid enough to stand underneath.   But on the lower floors, they might not have a choice -- there's only one elevator to deal with at the very top of the building, but by the time you hit the single-digit floor numbers you'll find each floor swarming with more multi-directional elevators than there are normal doors. Elevator Action ramps up the difficulty on you, progressing from a simple arcade action game, at its onset, into a more complicated puzzler further on.This design is one of Taito's best from the early days, and it's a gameplay style that has lived on and inspired many other titles over the years. The recent PSP sleeper Exit owes a lot to the old-school EA. You won't find a ton of depth and complexity in this arcade conversion, but there's no denying that Elevator Action is still home to some good old, addictive, drop-another-quarter fun. And hey, it takes a special kind of arcade classic to live on immortalized as the name of a rock band.", "date": "Mar 5, 2007"}
