Strangely enough, despite the team change, and the new engine and totally new feel, DD Raw is a good game on its own merits, complete with a much more robust gameplay selection and four-person multiplayer options.   Gameplay Just like Twisted Metal was always about fighting opponents with cars, Destruction Derby was always about smashing opponents' cars to bits with your own car. That simple premise is still the core of the game and amazingly enough, with a new engine, new physics, and stunt points the game still has a life of its own. Let's start with the physics engine. In the first two games, the engine was very much the exact same one used in Reflections' latest Driver game. You had cars that felt heavy but responded fairly well to the player. You also had cars that were even more sensitive to any single touch, nick and bump that came their way. The series was big on major slams, head-ons, and spins as a flurry of flying polygons, triangles, glass, and bits of pieces spun into the air and a symphony of crashing metal and shattering glass sounds rattled your ears. The feel was arcade-like, but the cars were also very slow, heavy, and certainly leaned on the shock-absorber side of things. In DD 1 and 2, you always swayed, bobbed, and bounced. With DD1 and DD2, you felt like you were steering from the front of the car, but that's not that case in DD Raw. Here, the cars steer from the middle of the chassis.   Still, in DD Raw, the cars feel entirely new. Players get immediate response from them. They roar in action with supernatural speed and acceleration. They bounce back from near-tumbles like Weebles most of the time, and they feel so much lighter and less bouncy than before that it's a little uncanny. They react and accelerate much faster than ever, but actually control with a slightly different touch. They're easier to control, easier to pick up and play, much more like cars that could be found in a coin-op game. These cars bear a strange similarity to those in Nascar Rumble. They seem nearly indestructible.    After you get a little used to the feel of the cars, each of which drives differently, you might discover just exactly how well structured and how much replay value the game does in fact have. Players choose from three main modes of play, Wreckin' Racing, Smash 4 $, and Battle, but each mode has several options and sub-modes within. For instance, in Wreckin' Racing, the linear portion of the game, you steadily open up new courses by placing in the top three spots of the current race. The vertical branching method enables you to logically follow an easy route or a more difficult route, or the option to switch alternately from course by course, depending on your liking. This mode alone contains 25 totally new courses, each with a different difficulty level, and many with intersecting areas for surprise collisions. For those who have been following racing games of late, 25 tracks (there are actually more in other game modes) is a return to the glory days, it's stunning in the year 2000.   Players get the chance to start with four unlicensed cars, although each vehicle resembles cars with which you and I are quite familiar. Players drive stunted Cameros, Impalas, Novas, Chargers, and what look like Galaxys in this mode. This is a pretty logical place to start, and players can go pretty far here without having to upgrade.   But to actually earn new cars, to upgrade them, repair them, buy new ones, or ditch old ones, players must play in Smash 4 $, a mode that is crucial to really seeing substantial change to the abilities of their cars. Players can upgrade the speed, acceleration, tires, brakes, and durability of each car. You see, in Smash 4 $ you earn money for the kind of damage -- the learned destructive skills -- that you pull off in each race. Even more to the point, one of the biggest changes in DD Raw is that it rewards you with points (that later translate into cash) for the kinds of hits you pull off.   For instance, you charge up into the trunk of your opponent, and you earn a few points for a Teeth Rattler. Later on you spin the car on your right into a 180 or even a 360, or you pull off a Jaw Clencher. You receive different points for each ~stunt.~ Players earn combos for doing multiple hits, including flipping cars, ramming into their sides, spinning them, etc. Once you get the idea, the game truly transforms from the DD of old into DD Raw. The idea of ~stunt~ points becomes clearer after each race because they are rated in two major areas, the position you placed, and the Stunt Points themselves, for a total accumulation. Match or beat the required point total for each race, and you can move on. Miss it and you need to try again.    As for the other mode, Battle, that's perhaps the most substantial section of the game. For those who want to go four-player split-screen, this mode is ready and waiting. Players can drive in Assault, which is a free-for-all that enables you to change the track, lap count, and carnage; DD, which is the classic mode from the first two games, and it includes Arena and Classic, which was the brutal survival mode. Then these is Skyscraper, which is just what it sounds like, a bunch of cars trying to smash each other off the top of a building -- it includes several skyscraper top levels; and finally Pass Da Bomb, which is essentially Hot Potato with cars. Players can boot up against the computer, or play with one to four other human players via a multitap. This new mode is great to have when a few friends are over.   All in all, I must say that despite the change in physics and car feel, the overall game, while more arcade-like and simpler in some ways, has been quite well thought out, well designed, and in terms of organization and the courses themselves, it provides an incredible breadth of modes and styles of play. It's no longer a Reflections game, and that's immediately noticeable in the look and feel, but it's a well-done game that's worth its price.   Graphics The first two DD games were noticeable for their phenomenal crash physics and great driving feel. But just like GT's new Driver, DD1 and DD2 also suffered from severe slowdown. Not only that, but you always got the strange sense that the game was just about to burst at the seams into a million little triangles, simply because of the sheer force that it used to crank the PlayStation engine to its limits.   One thing is for certain: while the collision engine works in this game, it's not nearly as substantial as in the earlier installments of the series. Yeah, bits and pieces fly off your car, and it's sorta cool. The cars take visual physical damage, and it's kinda nice, like for instance, a broken hood, or even a hood that flies off, damaged blinker lights, scratched up fenders, smoking, flaming engines and whatnot. But it's not nearly as phenomenal as in the first two games.   However harsh the criticism about the collision models is, this game's graphics are substantial. What's more, this is still a 32-bit PlayStation, not a N64 or a Dreamcast. It's the five-year old Sony machine. Granted it looks pixilated and course in comparison to pretty much any Dreamcast game, but Team 17 used every coding trick in the manual to make this game shine, and shine it does. Whether it's in four-player and cranking out the polys, or it's in DD, with about 22 cars all homing in toward you, or whether you're simply flying across a jump with a few other cars, the textures, physically changing cars, and effects are in top form -- compared to any PlayStation game.   Sound One thing I really like about DD Raw is the sound effects. When you first hear the roar of the engine, you feel power, and it feels good. The engines truly ROAR. Most of the engines sound rather similar, and I'm not sure if Studio 17 recorded each and every car, or just one car and modified that one again and again. Whatever the case, the high production on the engines, and the smashing sounds of glass and metal is stellar.   As for the music, well, I have to tell you I am well past being tired of straight-out guitar-heavy hard rock that sounds like Rob Zombie but isn't. I mean, thank God it's not Rob Zombie, but then again, it's pretty damn close. So, yeah, I have heard too much of this junk, but the average action racing junkie might not be, so maybe you'll like this repetitive one-chord nonsense better than me. But I don't think so. I suppose just in the light of being fair, the music does quite obviously match up with the game itself. I mean, I would have preferred dramatic classical music, or even just to be funny, Bolero. But I guess that's why I'm not a game developer. They'd look at my suggestions for music and throw me out. Hell, at least you heard it from me first. Classical music for destruction games would be awesome, you hear! Having played a substantial amount of Destruction Derby 1 and 2, I have to say that on many levels this game is better, and more well-rounded. And even in some cases, it's simply a better game than its predecessors. I prefer the Reflections engine to this one because it's so much more spectacular and complex. On the other hand, Destruction Derby Raw is a full, stand-alone game that incorporates ~Stunt~ points into the mix, while creating a physics model that's a little faster and easier to handle, and a little more accessible to the average gamer. I believe that for anyone who loves Destruction Derby 1 ands 2 and who likes Driver and who wants more of this kind of game, DD Raw has a lot to offer. If you just want the Reflections experience, than wait for Driver 2. In the end, what happens with DD Raw is that it's simply a different game. It still has the name, but it's different in feel, look, and most of all in the gameplay.", "date": "Oct 5, 2000"}
