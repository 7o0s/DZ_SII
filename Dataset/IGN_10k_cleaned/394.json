{"name": "Septerra Core: Legacy of the Creator", "name_review": "Septerra Core", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/12/septerra-core", "text": "It's not surprising that, after the success of Final Fantasy VII, PC gamers would start seeing more console-styled RPGs being released.  What is surprising is that we'd start seeing console RPGs (CRPG) that were never on any console.  Recently games like Silver and Septerra Core have given CRPG fans something to make their console cousins jealous -- especially in Septerra Core's case.  It's one part fantasy, one part cyberpunk; one part Fallout 2, one part Final Fantasy VII.  But however you classify it, Septerra Core is one heck of a lot of fun.  A lot of any RPG's charm lies in its story, and Septerra Core doesn't disappoint, offering a deep, rich, and engaging narrative throughout the game. Septerra Core is a planet comprised of seven layers or ~shells~ surrounding a central core (hence the name  sept meaning seven, terra meaning earth, and core meaning, well, core).  The history and mythology behind the peculiar planet tells of Marduk, a noble hero who hid the Gift of Heaven in the core to keep it away from evil hands.  An ancient prophecy foresees the day when someone of Marduk's blood will unlock the power of the core and gain the knowledge of the creator, in essence making them a god.  One of Marduk's lineage, the power-hungry Doskias, knows of the prophecy and takes it upon himself to attempt to unlock the secret of the core and retrieve the Gift of Heaven.  Mad with greed, Doskias doesn't care who he has to eliminate in order to obtain this ultimate power, and he leaves a trail of ruin throughout the shells as he makes his way to the central core.    That's where you come in. You begin the game as Maya, a junker from shell two who scavenges trash deposited by those on the shells above you.  The inhabited shells of Septerra Core are based on status, with the lower class citizens living on the lower shells closer to the radiating core.  The highest class, the Chosen (of which Doskias is a member), live on the outermost layer and care little for those below them.  As Doskias tears through the second shell, Maya gets wind of his plan and vows to stop the Chosen at all costs, since the last time they appeared on junker soil meant the destruction of her hometown and the death of her parents.    As with most RPGs, you'll control multiple characters as you make your way through the game.  Although there's no option to create your own characters, you will have a total of nine characters throughout the game that you can choose between to fill out your three-person party.  Just as in real life though, you have to make wise decisions about who to group together because not everyone sees eye-to-eye.  In the beginning it's easy as you only have to worry about managing Maya, her childhood friend Grubb, and his robotic dog Runner.  But other characters may bicker between one another, making your group less effective overall.  The designers have done a good job of including a number of side quests to bring some of the members closer together and work better as a team.  The key to building a good party in Septerra Core lies in balance.  It's not a good idea to have all tanks in your group with strong attacks and no special abilities.  Likewise, it's not a good idea to have a bunch of tinkerers who are good at fixing things, but useless when it comes to shooting a gun or throwing a punch.  The combat system in Septerra Core is handled very well.  Like most CRPGs, you pick your attack and watch an animation based on your chosen move.  Although combat is turn-based, Septerra Core opts for a time-based system which adds more of a real-time feel to the game.  Each character has three attacks -- weak, medium, and heavy  and three bubbles beneath their character portrait that fill during combat depending on a character's speed.  Weaker attacks obviously do less damage, but take a shorter amount of time to complete than heavier attacks.  The combat system in Septerra Core gives you much more variability than many CRPGs where you just pick an attack and go, and it offers up more strategy, especially when you're up against multiple enemies.  With the variable time attacks, you have more control over how much damage you dish out to a particular enemy.  The magic system is also handled very nicely in Septerra Core.  The game uses an interesting spell system based on Fate cards.  As you progress through the game, you'll find different cards that empower you with magical abilities.  The spells run the gambit from fire attacks to personal healing, ability enhancements to protection magics.  These cards can also be combined to create new spell effects, adding a lot of variety to the magic system.  Each spell requires a certain amount of core power, which will increase as you gain levels in the game.  More powerful spells require more core energy, so you have to be careful not to waste all of your core energy on big burners early in the combat phase only to be left without enough energy to heal your party when you need it the most.  As interesting as the story is and as clever as the combat options are, the game does suffer from the same downfall that plagues many CRPGs  Septerra Core is very linear.  It's not like traditional PC RPGs where, if you get stuck, you can continue exploring other areas and come back to the problem spot later.  Instead you're stuck at the same point until you finally figure out what to do.  While this can be a drawback, it's not so bad in Septerra Core because the story is entertaining enough to keep you from getting bored.  Without a solid and engaging storyline, this game wouldn't be nearly as fun.  But it's obvious that the designers were trying to weave a good tale as much as they were trying to develop an entertaining game.  Although Septerra Core uses a 2D graphics engine, the anime-inspired visuals are all well done.  While easy to overlook because of the drab, futuristic setting of the game, the landscapes and backgrounds are all highly detailed and carry a subtle beauty.  Character models are likewise highly detailed, and each character displays a lot of personality simply by the way they look.    The sound in Septerra Core is a mixed-bag. Unfortunately, the game lacks a good, continuous soundtrack, and you'll go for quite a while without any tunes at all.  While the music in the game is well done and even catchy at times, it's sparse.  Sound effects are also rather disappointing and repetitive.  However, the voice acting in the game is top notch, and the designers even payed special attention to making the character's mouths move along with every word of dialogue, instead of just opening and closing at random while the conversation is playing.  Although Septerra Core was developed entirely on the PC, there's no multiplayer options.  Too bad, because thinking about the possibility of Septerra Core co-op makes me wonder about the next incarnation of this series, but it's understandable considering its console stylings.  There's a lot to like in Septerra Core, and not much that truly stands out as poor design choice or frustratingly difficult.  If you opt for the minimum install, the game can be a bit slow when you're waiting for an encounter to load.  Instead I would suggest you sacrifice over 600 MB of hard drive space for the full install so you don't have long down times between the action.  All in all, the game is well worth it, and I was happy to give up over half a gig to Septerra Core to increase its performance.  Septerra Core came at a really good time, just when PC gamers have seen what good console RPGs like Final Fantasy VII can offer, and when they're wet with anticipation for Final Fantasy VIII.  If you can get over the linearity of Septerra Core and get into the story and the characters, then the game will offer up hours of fun and keep you CRPG fans busy until Final Fantasy VIII hits the PC sometime early next year.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Nov 12, 1999"}
