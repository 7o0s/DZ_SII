And in the case of Morpheme's Balloon Headed Boy, it's extreme quirkiness.   Features   32 levels  Collect balloons  Frogs   Balloon Headed Boy is a beautiful, silly NES-era throwback, before games were ~enhanced~ (read: bogged down) by thick plots and photo-realistic graphics. This is a simple action game with slight puzzle elements, easy platforming action, and peyote-influenced graphics. You could almost imagine Balloon Headed Boy as the game Miyamoto daydreamed of while working on Pikmin.   Best of all, Balloon Headed Boy is long. There are 32 levels, each increasing in difficulty, posing new challenges like spikes, gravity, and frogs with Gene Simmons-esque tongues. The goal of each level is to collect the requisite number of yellow balloons that opens the door to the next world. You will also learn new techniques from time to time, and a slight tutorial will teach you the ropes of being an airhead.   The game play is a breeze to master. You cannot jump; rather, you inflate the hero's head so he floats to the top of the screen. Deflate to land on a ledge. However, you do not have an unlimited supply of helium to float and flit about endless. When running low on balloon juice, collect a ~farty flower~ (Morpeme's words, not ours) to up your supply of gas.   While bumbling about, you must beware of the frogs that recently invaded your land, thanks to a terrible storm. These thunderous toadies will try to lick you, so its best to avoid them at all costs or defeat them using your newfound ballooning skills.   Balloon Headed Boy looks great. Sure, it's not terribly complicated, but who cares? It's brilliantly cute and wildly colorful. And while it's not full of bang and clang, there is plenty of silly sound effects to accompany the scenery.Balloon Headed Boy is fun. A lot of fun. The kind of fun you had while playing Alex Kidd on the Master System fun. And if you're like me, you miss those simple thrills -- but are happy to discover them again on handsets. Game Boy Advance games are even getting pretty ambitious. But Morpheme's Balloon Headed Boy reminds you of simpler times when all it took to have fun was a bizarro concept, day-glo graphics, and addictive game play.", "date": "Jul 13, 2004"}
