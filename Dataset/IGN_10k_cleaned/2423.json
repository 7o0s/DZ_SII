The games always did a great job of recreating the collegiate atmosphere and while they seemed to lean more towards fast-paced arcade-styled action than ultra-realism, it worked for some reason. All that known, it's no surprise that I was wet with anticipation when it was first announced that EA's college hoops series was coming to PlayStation 2.  Features My excitement and anticipation quickly turned into anger and confusion, though, as I first booted up the game. EA Sports is known for cramming its games with every single option and feature that one would ever expect in a sports game and more. Even those that don't quite like the company's sports history as much as myself would even agree with that. All this just made it much harder to stomach the fact that NCAA March Madness 2002 was stuck with a pretty bare bones feature set.   The game's play modes consist of only Play Now and Tournament. Nothing else. Dynasty Mode? Missing. Season mode? What's that? These play modes that have been staples in EA Sports' college games and help make NCAA Football 2002 one of the most enjoyable sports games ever released are completely non-existent in March Madness.   What's more, the roster of teams in the game, which seem like a respectable 150+, doesn't come close to the more than 300 that are normally offered up in college basketball games. Both of 989 Sports' PlayStation 2 college hoops games had more than 300 and so did EA's PlayStation versions of this particular series. There's really no excuse for missing all of these features.  Yes, it has full roster management capabilities including the ability to edit player names so you can put the real names in the game instead of just having numbers and positions. And it also does have an excellent Team Create option that lets you make your own school complete with a fight song and arena. But, that's pretty much it and quite frankly, it's not enough.    Gameplay If you're able to look past the lack of features and never play seasons, anyway, or just prefer playing your videogame hoops with friends, you might find some enjoyment in this featureless (okay, I'm bitter) game. The reason I say might is that it, just like the Live series and most basketball games in general, still has a lot of problems that help keep it from reaching the same level of excellence that EA has reached with its football and hockey games.   For March Madness, the developers have opted to take the basic Live engine and exaggerate things a bit to better reflect the openness of the college game. Because of this, you can expect more fast break opportunities, more slam dunks and more over-the-top action in general. In a way, it makes the game feel a little more like an arcade game than a simulation but it's not really that overblown.   You will see an excessive amount of steals, by yourself and the CPU, and more slams than you'll likely see in a real game, but it does seem that EA has fixed the rebounding problem that was in Live and most of the other stats seem fairly reasonable. The offensive versus defensive rebounding ratio seems to be at where it ought to be and you won't likely see any outrageous shooting percentages, either obnoxiously high or low, unless you play on the easier difficulty settings.   However, the control still has the same slippery feel that Live had and you're still going to encounter lots of problems with special moves either doing nothing but keep you in the same place without an advantage or taking you out of bounds (sideline sensitive special moves, anyone?).   Likewise, the AI has a lot of niggling issues that must be dealt with. Your computer-controlled teammates are pretty dumb for the most part and won't help out when your opponent makes drives to the hoop and the CPU tends to do stupid things like passing up open lanes to the basket and will make passes in inopportune situations. The CPU will shoot threes when behind late in the game, but you won't see them trying to run out the clock.   The AI also doesn't really pose all that much of a challenge. On the easier settings you can win games while only looking at the screen every once in a while and on the harder settings it's not all that difficult to take someone like the #145 Loyola Marymount team into Cameron Indoor and beat the #1 ranked Duke Blue Devils by double digits again and again.   Where you'll get the most fun out of this game is as a multiplayer game. Its over-the-top feel helps lend itself to some good two-player match-ups and since its main mode is tournament, EA has given this mode some nice customizable features (though, it is always the full tournament and can't be made with less teams).  Graphics What you're getting here is the NBA Live 2002 engine with some tweaks. What this means is that you're getting a pretty good-looking basketball game with detailed player models, some nice special effects and good overall player animations. You're also going to see a lot of problems with choppy transitional animations and player skins that look a little plasticky and unreal.   But before you think that EA just used the Live engine without any changes at all, they actually did some work here. The game sports quite a bit of new player animations including some very cool ones in the forms of players diving for loose balls on the ground and jumping for balls going out of bounds. Some of these are kind of slow, but it's more than you're getting in any other basketball game in these two particular cases.   Sound The best part of this game is probably its sound. The commentary, which is handled by a single announced, is pretty weak, very dry and often repetitive, but it's backed up by some incredible sound. There are more than 60 different and completely authentic fight songs that I could decipher and tons of team specific crowd chants and cheers. This has always been a strong point in EA's March Madness series and it continues here with the PlayStation 2 version.  The sad thing about March Madness is that I was really looking forward to this game and was probably one of the most excited sports gamers on the planet when EA first officially announced that this baby was headed for PlayStation 2. Hell, NCAA Football 2002 was unbelievably fun and stole away more than 200 hours of my time this past summer and I was hoping to get the same results out of NCAA March Madness 2002.However, once I got the game my excitement quickly turned into bewilderment. The game does not have a Dynasty mode, which is the mode that made EA Sports' college football game so damn fun to play. And what's worse is that it doesn't even have a single Season mode, either. What you get with this game is only an exhibition mode and a tournament mode, nothing more. You can't take your favorite team through a full season and you can't take a program from loser to dynasty over the course of few years. If you don't care about this stuff, just go ahead and give the game a look. It has a bunch of gameplay problems and AI flaws, which I've mentioned above, but it's a decent enough two-player game if ultra-realism isn't the most important thing in your life. Personally, I wouldn't go near this game with a ten-foot pole. EA Sports is still the king of sports, but their crown has some tarnish on it in my book thanks to this lackluster performance.", "date": "Jan 11, 2002"}
