One of the games from this agreement is the Game Boy Advance version of Freekstyle, a game among Electronic Arts' ~EA Big~ franchise. While the GBA game can't quite match the ~extreme~ atmosphere of the console design, DSI Games has produced a great racing game that's extremely fun and challenging, with only a couple of technical shortcomings keeping this portable development down. Features Link cable support for two players Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  The Game Boy Advance version of Freekstyle was helmed by GBA developer Full Fat, a team name that might be familiar to those who've played through the handheld versions of Acclaim's Dave Mirra and Aggressive Inline series. The studio's rendition of Freekstyle actually utilizes a version of the poly-character, scrolling engines utilized in those previously mentioned GBA games, but in the case of Freekstyle, the team tailored it for the more fast-paced, balls-to-the-wall energetic design of the Freekstyle series. The result is a fluid and speedy racing title that features Micro Machines-style gameplay, and combines the trick-based elements of Tony Hawk and Dave Mirra and the appropriately loose and technical control of dirt-bike racing. It's a combination that works extremely well on the GBA.  Like the console game, the GBA version of Freekstyle has its races broken down into several specific tournaments that must be won by coming in first in each full-circuit challenges. Players will have to outrace the competition of three very skillful computer-controlled drivers by not only controlling the bike on a technical level (following the course properly and not going off-road), but also by launching off jumps and performing a series of tricks that will build up both the turbo meter as well as the Freekstyle indicator. If there's even a slight bit of green showing in the turbo bar, holding down the B button will give the bike a serious boost of speed; pulling off the coveted Freekstyle mode when the bar is maxed out will net a near unlimited amount of top speed acceleration that really shows off just what the game engine can do. Even with the four fully polygonal characters and bikes on the screen, the game never slows down. In fact, the developers even add a few bits of graphical flair; skid along dirt and the tires leave a temporary streak cut into the earth. Hit the Freekstyle mode and the screen will illuminate with a cool ~white-out~ effect. All of this is accompanied by excellently sampled music from the console version's audio soundtrack.  The racing engine is pulled off splendidly on the Game Boy Advance system since the game requires a lot of attention on the technical side of things; players will have to release the gas to hit the turns as skillfully as possible. The bike's controls do take some effort to learn since the bike features some ~extreme~ handling, with the rear ending kicking out during turns to throw the balance off just a bit. There are a couple of quirks in the collision detection that could help or hinder players during the race; hit an opponent from the rear, for example, and it'll send him flying with an assisted boost in speed instead of causing a time-consuming wreck. The developers also assist in the race a bit to keep the bikes moving along a straight path, but this is definitely a welcome decision because the game features that tricky isometric perspective that can fool the eyes...especially when the bike's airborne. Freekstyle's trick engine isn't quite as balanced as it's racing elements, though; it's definitely important to pull off airborne tricks, sure...but there just doesn't seem to be nearly as much reward offered for stringing together a variety of tricks over a string of the same trick over and over.  And as great as the racing gameplay is in Freekstyle, the decision to go password over cartridge save actually hurts the lasting play of the design. The game definitely keeps track of the best overall and lap times during the race, but without an EEPROM to save this data to, these are statistics that are lost as soon as they're awarded. On top of this, all of modifications that players perform on each of the characters are lost once the power's been kicked off. The password, awarded at the end of each cup, only records which tournament cup has been completed, as well as the earned unlockable(s) that are attached to those accomplishments. This development omission is only emphasized further in the two-player link mode where players can't even compare their best times with each other. That's pretty much the only mark against Freekstyle; the lack of any real save feature is a huge downside, absolutely, but at least the developers come through with an extremely well designed and challenging dirt-bike racer. It's great to see the team's engine evolve from its extreme sports roots into a versatile racing design.", "date": "Sep 2, 2003"}
