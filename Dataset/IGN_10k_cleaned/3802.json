Someone somewhere had a bulb erupt in their skull and decided it was time Virtua Tennis was dethroned. Too bad the shards of neuron obstructing glass were never swept away. To conquer the reigning champ's currently unopposed kingdom, Oxygen Interactive and Aqua Pacific crafted a piece of antiquated technology, slapped in some mysteriously unresponsive controls, mimicked the annoyance of Wave Race 64's sickeningly enthusiastic announcer of death, and then dropped any and all modes worth playing, as well as any shred of tennis authenticity. The end result? A battering-ram that can't batter or ram -- Perfect Ace, a serve that flies clear off the entire tennis court and hits you, an innocent bystander, right in the face. Believe me, it will leave a horrible mark.  Instead of improving upon a standard set by a three-year-old game (Virtua Tennis), why not just anger everyone? Perfect Ace: Pro Tournament Tennis commendably accomplishes this task of pissing off all who play it. It fails to offer a shred of what made the stunning Virtua Tennis enjoyable and even manages to take a substantial and mystifying leap backward through time to actually deliver a bafflingly less complete and less enjoyable experience. Every single component, from the presentation, to the graphics, to the audio, to the appeal, to the freaking box, screams of a flagrant overdose of mediocrity. The game is a cave-in and a copout. It settles with simply existing. It's content with being not even close to good enough.   Should you purchase this game? Is ~worth~ a word lost on the industry? Where is my Earl Gray tea at? None of these questions will be answered in the following text, for the last two are beyond the scope of this review and the first is rhetorical.  Why is Perfect Ace this way? Pick and choose. Pick and choose any single aspect of the game and I'll tell you why. How about play? What makes a good tennis game? Better still, what makes a good game? Fluid control and instantaneous response, my friend. Does Perfect Ace ooze out pools of either? Hell no.   Motion captured animation is a great idea on paper, but if the transitions aren't there, the finished product often lacks the kind of fluid playability it requires to be good. Since tennis games rely heavily, if not entirely on quick reflexes and responses to lightning fast volleys and serves, being able to position a player and press a button to return the ball without delay is a necessity. Perfect Ace gets this right, but too infrequently to appreciate. The control is sporadic enough to fail about twice per set, making it downright infuriating. Thankfully, computer controlled opponents, even on the hardest difficulty setting that I swear by, are so grossly incompetent and prone to making the same mistakes with such a startling degree of regularity that the sloppy control is almost a moot point. Almost.   Winning the doubles tournament in two-player but only playing with one player is possible. Oh yes. I cranked the difficulty, let my comrade hang loose, and won the damn game myself. When it came time for the idle second player to serve, I'd serve with him, just as I would return a serve when required, but for general play I only used one of my men exclusively. And, I used him to kick the hell out of everyone else. If you hit balls close to the net and far to either side, there's literally no way for the AI opponent to return because the collision detection on the outer rim of the courts is so horrendous they'll actually be caught by invisible barriers. If they do return something, lay the heat right down the middle and watch the confusion overtake them as they both scurry to the center just to do nothing. It's comedic, but in that nasty Snoop Dogg's Doggy Fizzle Televizzle kind of way that invokes nausea along with a few fleeting giggles.  ~Advanced~ controls are present but there's not a whole lot of point to using slices, lobs, and top spins. To illustrate this, I kept the difficulty on hard and bound all of those keys to something inaccessible, like ~Home.~ I then used my gamepad and one button to devastate the competition. Good stuff. It's an amazing accomplishment, beating every match in a tournament with little to no resistance and only faltering when the game itself works against you with cheating computer opponents, or a decision to deny you your return and instead toss out an animation and a swing you simply did not choose to execute. Sometimes it's physically impossible to return a certain type of serve regardless of how you direct your shot or with what type of hit you choose. Now that's a feature. Other times, it's totally possible, but then completely impossible, since the computer will just make your player scurry off in another direction. Presto, two features like this = challenge.   This game makes me want to hurt people.   So the meat of this meal is spoiled. What about the potatoes? Modes include tournament, a different kind of tournament called championship that's slightly more demanding, and exhibition. Mini-games? Nope. Online or LAN play? Nope, but it is possible to enjoy the game with three other lost souls at a single machine (only in exhibition). Real players? Nope. Real courts? Not really. Players with distinct, recognizable personas or attributes or tendencies or strengths or weaknesses? Keep the fantasy alive. We get none of that, but we can enjoy the beauty of 640 x 480 graphics in either 16 or 32-bit color. Thank goodness for FSAA and anisotropic filtering.  As a disheartening fact, the graphics of Perfect Ace are also worse than Virtua Tennis' (nifty camera in singles not withstanding). Worse even than that game of 2000, eh? Indeed. Aside from players licking their chops or sauntering about the court in celebratory slow-mo after a match, they all look...freakish. I'm not a superficial fellow -- if you saw me you'd know why -- but even I deeply believe that the appearance of some of these blokes is just downright offensive. There's the dude with the frontal comb over, the chunky one with the bizarre head, and the Kenyan player who looks suspiciously white. At least there are Croatian pros (being a corrupt Croat myself, I'm tempted to start dishing out 10.0s just for this one simple inclusion), but they're not real and they're not very pretty.  Ah, but who needs real players when you've got the majesty of the full-featured ~Player Editor~ as advertised on the back of the box? ~Become a character in the game and create your own dream partner,~ it boasts. Dream partner? Shiri Appleby? Yes! Finally she and I will play together, just as I've promised everyone I've ever met. I'm going to create my dream player (her) by manipulating height, weight, skin color, hair types, face types, attributes, and more. This is going to be great and it'll totally help me forget the horrors of playing Perfect Ace, just as Shiri's loveliness can help a boy in a dead-end job with no education (school was more about drinking and sleeping) forget any and every worry. Funny, I don't see the player editor in the main menu. Wait, what's this hidden in the options? Player Name Editor? Ah, this must be it. Let's see what kind of dream player I can create.     At least the player name editor is appropriately titled. No deception here. It allows gamers to choose an existing tennis player and edit his name. Fan-freaking-tastic. It almost makes this overwhelming suicidal tendency go away. Gameplay like this hasn't been seen since I was first able to enter my initials in Pac-Man to record a damned high score. This level of mastery over simple text is astonishing. Clearly this is the greatest piece of crap the world has ever seen. Perhaps soon I'll be infected by some form of West Nile virus that was spread across the packaging. Then perhaps I'd at least feel I'd gotten my money's worth. Sounds terrific!      Sounds? Who said sounds? I want fried chicken! I want a big, fat, untouched chicken that's been deep fried so that I can mercilessly club Perfect Ace's announcer to death with it. I'm so sorry, perhaps that was a bit brutal and uncalled for. I rescind my previous comment and would like to replace it with,   I really want to club the announcer to death with a dead bird.   It's times like these that I fondly recall Clint Eastwood's famous closing comments in Unforgiven. ~All right now, I'm comin' out. Any man I see announcing for Perfect Ace out there, I'm gonna shoot. Any sumbitch announcing for Perfect Ace says a word at me, I'm not only gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife 'n all his friends... Burn his damn house down!~  I too didn't realize they had Perfect Ace back in the Old West, but then I suppose the evil ones do live longest, just like cursed mummies. I have this grandpa who's writing an autobiography and somewhere around page 1,592 there's about six mentions of Dracula. Freaking Dracula in an autobiography! Paps is 99 or 189 or whatever the nuts. So you know.  I don't want to write about the game anymore. Why can't I just put Jane's Addiction lyrics in here to fill space and kill time? No one is going to read this, so it'll at least look like I'm working.  ~I love standing by the water, and just knowing what it's for. It's alright to swim and sip it, let me have a little more. Like my woman, like my shower, get them hot until their steaming. I love to find a little spot, nice and shady that's for dreaming of the riches.  Tell me? Why is the announcer stuck repeating the same six phrases? Why does he tell me the match I had was great when I lost to the computer? Is it because the audience belligerently makes an excessive amount of noise through each and every set? Is he angry at them? Well, at least the balls thunk and clud nicely. Goodness knows that recreating the sound of a ball hitting dirt is difficult. That has to outshine the crazy throwback, chipper, arcade funk that plagues the game, right? More Jane's lyrics would be better, I know.  There is but one truly positive thing to be said about Perfect Ace and that is that it could very well never see release stateside. I have not seen it in any store, nor have I seen it available for purchase at any online retail outlet. As far as I can tell, this game is content with cursing the greater European populous for all eternity. Huzzah! Once again we North Americans get away scot-free by doing absolutely nothing. Let's hope it stays that way.  I've had it with this game. I'm quitting immediately. Alright, where's that exit button? Hmmm, it's not in the main menu and not in any relevant submenus. Trying to trick me into continually playing, are you Perfect Ace? We'll see about that! Don't think I'm not above hurling a brick at my computer to free it from your torturous grasp, you bastard. That's it, where's my killing brick at, Dan? Wait! Of course, the exit button is hidden in the ~About~ menu. Marvelously deceptive.If only the rest of Perfect Ace could be so clever. If only that same someone, somewhere who had a light bulb burst in his head actually played Virtua Tennis and made it a priority to outdo that game and not disgrace its very existence with this, the title that's designed to wipe a boy clean of his will, decency, love for the sport, and faith in mankind. Perfect Ace is not so wretched in any one area that it deserves to be spooned into the fire pit with Air Raid and Varmint Hunter, but it's so disgracefully lacking in so many different ways that justifying its purchase would be such a huge effort in lying, even the Devil himself would dare not undertake it. And he's called the Prince of Lies, for crying out loud! Forget this game and this review and whip out the Dreamcast or attempt to find Empire's elusive port of Virtua Tennis for the PC, assuming you don't have a PS2 and a copy of Tennis 2k2. Perhaps then you might actually find joy.", "date": "Jul 29, 2003"}
