This venture into the realm of pinball action actually serves the noble cause of being a history lesson as well. The meat of the game involves simulating pinball games from Gottlieb that have come out every decade from the 1930's to the present. So, not only do you get quite a few tables (seven), but you can also view the actual history of the game as it evolved over the years.   Unfortunately, if you are a casual pinball player, this pack will only make you conclude that pinball as a genre has always sucked. Out of the seven tables presented only two are worth playing, and despite the overall high production values of the pack nothing can really save a bad table from being immediately boring.   The really sad part of this whole story (if you find this type of thing to be emotionally involving that it) is that the games are all flawlessly produced. The graphics are crisp and clean, the ball physics are great, and the sounds are as accurate as they can get. Even the tiniest details have been reproduced like the reflection of the table on the ball. In fact, gazing at a shot of the game the only way it's possible to tell that you're not looking at a real table is because of the lack of spilled beer and cigarette burns -- visually the game is simply amazing.  The real problem lies with the fact that video pinball is entirely different from real pinball. It's just not the same experience and not all tables can successfully make the jump over to video simulations because of the obvious differences in the two mediums. History is great, but in the end we need to have fun playing the games as well.   Here's how the tables stack up:  Baffle Ball - 1931  It's amazing that pinball ever got off the ground as a pastime if this is its roots. Think ~Pachinko~ but slower. There are no flippers and you just shoot the ball and see what you score. Whee!  Humpty Dumpty- 1947  Well, there are flippers in this game, but they adorn the side of the board all of the way down and the object is to keep the ball from reaching the bottom. This table is just barely interactive and there isn't really anything to score on. Yawn.  Knock Out- 1950  This game actually resembles the pinball we know and love today except for the lack of real targets and the inhuman space between your two flippers. The boxing theme is well done and the game is actually moderately fun to play except for one big fatal flaw. This flaw is, of course, the huge gap between your flippers which leaves approximately 1/3rd of the board undefendable when the ball comes down at you. To prevent you from dying there is a barrier in this gap for a little while, but once you hit a certain score it drops and you die. It's really depressing and you'll feel quite hopeless the first time this happens because, no matter how well you've been doing you're going to die soon.  Spirit of '76- 1976  This is your basic pinball table. In today's terms it's about as generic as it gets with 3 bumpers at the top and a few scattered targets to knock down. If one remembered this Pinball machine fondly it might be a good trip down memory lane, but for the average pinball player it's just not exciting.  Haunted House- 1982  Finally, a pinball machine that is close enough to modern day to be fun. With three levels and plenty to do, haunted house is a lot of fun. The haunted house theme is nice with a graveyard and ghoulies everywhere. The sounds are all classic 80's arcade though, so get ready for lots of bleeps and bloops. This is the table you'll play the most if you buy this product.  Cue Ball Wizard- 1992  This game is a classic case of overkill. Between the voices, the skill shots, the cheesy pool theme, and the dozens of flashing lights this game is far more impressive to watch than to play. In fact, the whole giant pool ball in the center of the board really detracts from the experience instead of being the creative touch the designers were hoping for.  Well, there you go. As a game Pinball arcade fails because the tables just aren't much fun. As a history lesson or trip down nostalgia lane it's great because of its top notch visuals and accuracy.   -- Blake Fischer", "date": "Feb 12, 1999"}
