Enter the mobile maker's new puzzler, Bliss. This little brain-teaser may be a trifle of a game, aping Dr. Mario at almost every turn, but the more you play, the more money GOSUB 60 donates to breast cancer research. This is an excellent idea, bringing something very positive to gaming space and turning what would otherwise be an average puzzler into a cause celeb.   Bliss is another match-color puzzle game, but instead of offering a blank slate like Tetris, you begin with at least a handful of colored balls in the well. Pairs of colored spheres drop into the well one at a time. You must clear the starting balls by matching at least four same-colored spheres. Finish off the starting ball and its on to the next screen.   The game is engaging to a degree, but it brings absolutely nothing new to the table. It's a solid puzzle design that functions on every level, but it's no pulse-raiser. Of course, this could likely be by design -- Bliss, with its playfully soothing color schemes (it looks like an iPod commercial), is decidedly casual. By not raising the challenge barrier too high, GOSUB 60 guarantees that ultra-casual gamers won't be turned off and keep on matching colors for charity.   Every score threshold you cross in Bliss unlocks a new code which, when input at the game site, donates money to breast cancer research. After just five minutes with the game, I made a dime. That sounds small, sure, but stretch that across a thousand players, and you start to see progress. Very cool.  I am scoring Bliss on a purely technical level -- it's an average puzzler that doesn't advance the ball. But I recommend everybody take a look at it because of GOSUB 60's awesome idea of turning Bliss into an interactive charity. I'm not necessarily for publishers cribbing ideas from other games, but this is one concept I hope everybody steals. Let's do some good.", "date": "Jul 4, 2007"}
