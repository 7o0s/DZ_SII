Sadly, Crave Entertainment's Men in Black: The Series, inspired by the animated series based in turn on the popular Will Smith blockbuster, falls under the latter category.  Features  Three difficulty settings. Password saving. Six different environments. Hunt down 12 different alien races. Multiple weapons. Based on the animated series.   Players take the role of agent J and join the ranks of the Men in Black (MIB), the secret government agency dedicated to making sure that all aliens follow Earth's rules and regulations -- and to keep the general public from finding out that aliens exist in the first place.   The series' premise serves as the background for an uninspired sidescrolling shooter that has the player blast his way through six different alien-infested levels, including underground sewers, building rooftops, airports and the MIB headquarters. There are 12 different alien races, inspired by the series, such as slimy Skraaldians and funky Fmecks. While most of the enemies tend to either drop from the ceiling or jump out of holes, there are a few that camouflage themselves as roadside items, such as bicycles, and only reveal their real form when approached by the player. Men in Black is a very formulaic action game with little variety and sub-par gameplay. Both the game speed and the control feel much too sluggish for a shooter, resulting in a repetitive game of walk, stop, jump, shoot. On the positive side, Men in Black does sport some nice backgrounds and cool animated FMV intro sequences. But unless you're more into watching a game than actually playing it, stay clear of this Game Boy Color bore.", "date": "Jul 13, 1999"}
