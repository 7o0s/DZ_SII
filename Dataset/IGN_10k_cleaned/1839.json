Oddly enough, the sport that has consistently been the slimmest when it comes to features and a general attention to detail from EA Sports has been baseball, which just so happens to be a sport that attracts the highest number of fans that are hardcore into stats and other intricacies of their favorite pastime.   And with the company's first baseball game on PlayStation 2, Triple Play Baseball, there are no signs that this trend of giving the gamer a simple, no frills, game of baseball is about to change. Triple Play has all of your basic play modes -- quick game, exhibition, season, and playoffs -- and even has a tremendously fun take on the standard home run derby in its Big League Challenge, but nothing is really offered here much beyond the customary stuff.   Roster management is limited in that it only allows same number of player trades, in game strategy doesn't allow for double switches, line-ups can't be set-up specifically for left- or right-handed pitchers, created players have a very limited number of batting stances and pitching styles. The statistical tracking is also pretty weak in that league leaders for the regular season are deleted once the playoffs stats and the season stats for all the players in the league that didn't make the playoffs are also wiped out.   Gameplay  While this is obviously not a game meant for the baseball videogame fan that wants a completely accurate representation of the real-life sport, it isn't that bad of a game -- just a very limited one.  As far as batting is concerned, users are limited to using a cursor based batting mechanic. Fans of the Triple Play Series that preferred to play with the cursor off in the past, where you only rely on timing and the pressing up on the digital pad for a home run swing, will find that this option isn't in the company's first PS2 incarnation of the series.   However, for those that favored the extra skill involved in using a batting cursor, they'll find that the cursor mechanics are much refined here in Triple Play on PS2. The large block-shaped cursor that clunkily moved around strike zone, has been replaced with an oval shaped cursor that has a red circle in the middle that denotes the player's power zone and a larger oval around it indicating the overall hitting surface. The size of each part is based on the contact and power hitting skills of the real-life player and helps make it more accurately represent the skill differences of good and bad hitters, as well as contact and power hitters.   The only problem is that even with this, most players will find that it's fairly easy to get a lot of hits and home runs with just about any player in the game. Scores will commonly be in the double digits when playing the game on the easy or medium difficulty settings, and even though it gets a little harder to score on the hardest setting, it still has an arcade feel because the hit variety isn't quite as deep as what you'll get in more sim-oriented games. Hits like line drives and high fly balls and home runs are far more common than high bouncing grounders or sharply hit grounders down the first or third base lines.   Controlling the runners on the base paths is fairly easy to do, as you simply have to use the L1 to advance all runners and R1 to retreat all. The runners can be individually advanced by using the left analog stick or d-pad and caused to retreat with right analog stick, which is a magnificent way to handle things because it really makes it easy to control multiple people on the base paths without much confusion.   This intelligent use of the control pad can also be seen in the pitching and throwing. In both cases, the user is given analog control over the speed of the throw or pitch based on how hard the pressure sensitive face button on the controller is pressed -- the harder it's pressed the faster the throw and vice versa. This makes pitching especially fun because you not only have the ability to mix up pitch types, but you can also mix up the speed of the pitches to try and outwit the opposing computer- or human-controlled batter.   While that aspect of pitching is very cool, the game limits the pitcher to only four pitch types, so players like Mike Mussina or Pedro Martinez that have a larger staple of pitches in their arsenal, aren't really represented that well. The raw number of different pitches that you'll find in the game isn't quite comparable to other PS2 baseball titles, either.   Also, until you find the sweet spots, you'll find that the number of home runs and runs you'll give up in general are a bit inflated, even if you're using someone as good as a Pedro Martinez or Greg Maddux. And not only are home runs plentiful, but things are made worse because of the fielding problems. There's not any kind of auto fielding options available with the fielding mechanics only changed by the overall difficulty setting of the game.   When on Easy, the player will automatically run towards the ball by pressing the directional pad in any direction, while on normal and hard, you have to move the player manual with a cursor of varying sizes. The fielding cursor is obnoxiously sized and really gets in the way of the field of view, but can't really be turned off because when you do, it's almost completely impossible to judge where the ball is being hit.   What makes things even worse is that the computer often selects a player that isn't the closest one to the ball and the general speed of the outfielders are too slow if you're not using the speed burst button to get them around. So, unless your ready to tap the X button constantly when fielding balls in the outfield, prepare to see a lot of should-be outs fall for singles or doubles in the gaps.   The game also has pretty weak baseball AI. You won't see good pinch-hit decisions or smart moves by the computer controlled team in the form of sacrifice bunts to move up the runner from first or stolen base attempts when you have a big base stealing threat on base. A lot of it might not come into play because the games tend to be high scoring, but it's a part of baseball that you won't really see in the game.   Graphics In terms of graphics and presentation, EA Sports reigns supreme once again. The only significant complaints that can be made about the visuals in Triple Play Baseball are that there are some bouts of slowdown, which never affect the gameplay, and the player models aren't sized like their real-life counterparts. The player models are a bit short and stocky looking, which would be fine and dandy if all the players in baseball were built like Steve Garvey. But since there are more tall and slender players than there are short and chubby, the models in the game don't do well in mimicking the real life players that they are supposed to represent.    Outside of these two minor flaws, the game looks fantastic and is pretty much on par with the other PlayStation 2 sports titles that EA Sports has released onto the market. The player models, while not accurately sized, are incredibly detailed and the stitching of the team logos on the jerseys give off the impression of depth and not just something that was pasted on the uniform. The players also have fully articulated fingers, the uniforms have lots of little details like wrinkles, and the helmets actually look like a 3D object that's been placed on a player's head and not just part of the model.   The batter and pitcher animations are equally impressive. The batters have a very fluid and lifelike motion when standing at the plate waiting for a pitching, with some having a little wiggle to their butts or rocking motion with their bats, and it gives off the impression that you're watching a living, breathing person. The only shortcoming in the animation department can be seen with the fielders, which animate smoothly, but lack the variety that can be seen in other games. The throwing, catching and transition animations are smooth, but there's just not a lot of variety in terms of different types of throws and catches. You won't see the first baseman swipe at a low throw, the shortstop won't reach out for a ball to his side with his glove and outfielders won't go down to one knee on lightly hit grounders into the outfield.   Triple Play also gets high marks for the level of detail and accuracy of the ballparks. All of the stadiums are truthfully represented with lots of the unique nuances of each stadium in the game. Things like the ivy on the fences in Wrigley, Roberto Clemente Bridge in the background of PNC Park, the big glove in Pac Bell Park and even the unique design and fan-shaped convertible roof of Miller Park (haven't seen it closed, though) are all accurately displayed in the game.   The 2D, pixilated crowds are nicely animated and will actively cheer, clap their hands and even do the wave if you don't press any buttons for a while. You can also add great lighting and shadows to the already long list of things that are impressive about the visuals of this game.    Sound The commentary and play-by-play work in Triple Play Baseball, which is handled by Buck Martinez and Sean McDonough, is well done for the most part. The group works well together and the majority of the comments made by each are fairly lively and flow nicely with the onscreen action.    However, some of Sean McDonough's play-by-play sounds a bit robotic and he'll occasionally repeat the same thing twice, and you'll pretty much hear all of Buck Martinez's specific commentary about a team, ballpark or player during the first game that each appears in. So, when playing a three game series against Baltimore at Camden Yards, you'll get the same speech about Ripken's breaking of Lou Gehrig's record several times in each of the three games.    The audio effects definitely fall in the love it or hate it category. As fans of the series have come to expect, EA Sports has opted to go with arcade-like sounds for big hits and foul balls to liven up a sport that many consider to be a bit on the boring side. When players make good contact, they're greeted with a giant rocket-like boom, which really makes the player feel as if he's done something special. It definitely helps make home runs feel a bit more powerful, but baseball purists will undoubtedly rather have a more realistic sound crack of the bat, which in their mind might even stir up more emphatic emotions. Considering that EA Sports is well known for always being the leader when it comes to features included in a sports game, it's odd that its baseball series is the most limited of all the upcoming baseball videogames. The sad truth is that even if you look at Triple Play Baseball on PlayStation 2 purely from the standpoint of an arcade style baseball game, where you're going to get more games with double digit scoring than not, it still falls short of what it should be. The game limits the player to a single method for hitting and fielding and doesn't even allow you to change things as much as you could in the PlayStation version of the same game. If you're a fan of the series that wants to handle hitting simply by timing the swing correctly and pressing up on the directional pad for a home run swing, you don't have that option. That's not to say that Triple Play Baseball is a bad baseball videogame, because it isn't. It's actually a good game of hardball, albeit a very limited one. If you're okay with the 15-13 contests, star pitchers finishing a season with an ERA over 7.00, home run totals for league leaders in the 80-plus range, a batting cursor and no power swing, and manual fielding at all times, then you'll find that Triple Play Baseball will probably meet your needs perfectly and is a very enjoyable game to play. If you want anything that strays away from that formula at all, then you'll be sorely disappointed.", "date": "Mar 14, 2001"}
