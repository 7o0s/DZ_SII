It's had some exquisite highs, such as the Return of the King adventure game, and one low -- the Lord of the Rings Pinball game. (In all fairness, EA did have that sputtering Third Age RPG.) With fan interest in the trilogy hardly waning, JAMDAT has released an action game based on sequences from all three movies, entitling the quest Lord of the Rings Trilogy.   Lord of the Rings Trilogy is, quite simply, and excellent play. Mobile actioners are a total mixed bag (JAMDAT's own Samurai is an example of an ~almost there~), but Lord of the Rings Trilogy delivers on what it has to: Sword-swinging action. Gamers slide into the boots of trilogy hero Aragorn and attempt to complete a series of missions based on scenes from the movie, such as the Ringwraith encounter at Weathertop and the trouble at Minas Tirith. The scene selection is smart and is sure to please all fans.   As Aragorn, you must rush about some nicely drawn locations that bear a good likeness to the movie sets, cleaving orcs and Uruk-Hai in two with your sword. Aragorn also has access to a bow and arrow, which offers ranged attacks for situations where you're better off not letting the monster get close enough to you to strike. This is essentially the essence of the game, and it properly uses platformer staples like health potions, puzzle switches, and checkpoints to level the playing field against progressively tougher enemies.   One of the things I liked about Lord of the Rings Trilogy was the length of the levels. They are not so long as to make you start wondering if you'll complete the current scene before your bus stop, but not so short that you feel your money was ill-spent. There is a sweet spot to the size of mobile games, and JAMDAT has hit upon it with Lord of the Rings Trilogy.   I also appreciated the use of stealth in the game. According to the source material, rangers like Aragorn are able to slip into areas undetected and launch attacks before the enemy knows what hit them. This translates to the mobile game. It's not quite Sam Fisher-style stealth, but when Aragorn slips into the shadows, a dark hue is cast over his character and it is indeed harder for monsters to see him.   Finally, I admire the reverence for the source material. JAMDAT has not crafted a cash-run here, a quickie to capitalize on a DVD release or some such marketing hook. This is a game for the fans, by fans. Lord of the Rings Trilogy is complete with smart text that describes the scenes, an adherence to proper character and monster design (the invincible ringwraiths look great), and a good action engine that ties it all together. Mobile gamers will undoubtedly be glued until the game is complete.Lord of the Rings Trilogy is one of those rare mobile games where I was determined to play through to the end -- upon the first time I started it up. Action gamers and Tolkien fans with cellphones will have a great time with this smart game. The control is tight, the monster design and intelligence is spot-on, and the selected scenes are well chosen. The art style and play mechanics reminded me of one of my favorite action platformers of yesteryear, Rygar. I absolutely recommend Lord of the Rings Trilogy as a game for hardcore video game fans to deflower their phones with. While the scene is still hopping with excellent casual games, it's definitely good to see a title that squarely aimed for the other end of the gaming spectrum.
