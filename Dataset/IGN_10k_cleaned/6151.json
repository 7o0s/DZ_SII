Of course, the technology certainly has a lot working against it -- it's hard to get the heebie-jeebies off of a 1.5-inch screen. But that certainly hasn't stopped Centerscore from giving it the proverbial college try. And while I didn't need a nightlight after I finished playing, I definitely appreciated some of the creepy factor that the developer was able to infuse in this largely enjoyable romp.   What I appreciated right off the bat was that Alone: The Horror Begins didn't try to completely ape Resident Evil, the de facto survival horror game. Both games have zombies and slightly awkward control schemes, but that's about it. Moving the hero about requires a little practice and patience. Just like RE, you move by pressing up, no matter what direction your character is facing. You turn by pressing left and right, then retreat by pressing down. It takes a little getting used to for non-genre fans, and in some of the scarier parts, you always seem to temporarily forget how to escape. This usually results in running face first into a zombie or getting stuck in a corner. But hey, that's panic for you.   Alone: The Horror Begins spins a good yarn. You are the sole survivor (or are you?) of an airplane crash in a remote, desolate area. You are armed only with a flashlight, cellphone, and cattle prod. Those are good tool choices, as none of them tip the odds in your favor at any time. The cellphone is a nice inclusion, as it gives you a direct tie to the lead character. He uses the phone to communicate to a friend, but the service is not always reliable. Hey, just like one of my phones...   The flashlight is another great instrument. You use the flashlight to ward off enemies called Howlers. However, using a flashlight attracts to unwanted attention of zombies. Heh. That's clever, and it keeps you on your toes. You have to be a little picky with how you use the flashlight, too, as there is only a limited amount of juice in the thing. Fortunately, there are batteries strewn about you can uncover. The lack of a conventional weapon is really effective in any horror experience -- game, movie, etc. -- and the decision to give you only a flashlight and cattle prod was a solid move from Centerscore.   I'm laying off revealing too many story elements, because I like the way Alone: The Horror Begins parses out information. But I think the game has great pacing, and if you have the time to sit down and play it in a dark room (I played it at night before hitting the sack), you'll be rewarded.   Alone: The Horror Begins is not the most handsome mobile game I've played. The zombies and howlers, so small on the screen, don't pose much of a physical threat to your nerves. However, the backgrounds (at least, what you can see of them -- but more on that in a minute) are painted with an appropriately grim palette. However, you don't see much of it, thanks to an effect that casts the screen in darkness, save for the cone of your flashlight. That plays well in this kind of game, especially when you roll the beam over an incoming zombie.  I have great respect for Centerscore's efforts with Alone: The Horror Begins -- it really provides an experience that I think is sorely lacking in mobile. And it's certainly the right season for it. The game requires some time to get the most out of it, but those who like horror will certainly enjoy themselves. The pacing is solid and the use of the flashlight and cellphone in-game are great. The RE-style controls sometimes bothered me, but with time you train yourself to use them correctly. If you're looking for a deep, satisfying mobile game with teeth, Alone: The Horror Begins should be on your to-download list.", "date": "Oct 13, 2005"}
