The venerable high-level real time empire game is finally embracing an ancient setting and we couldn't be happier about the prospect. We've spent the last few weeks playing through the final version of the game, trying desperately to hold onto the crumbling Seleucid empire, building a working coalition of Greek states, resisting imperial encroachment as a small Spanish colony, and even taking sides as the titans Rome and Carthage clashed across the Mediterranean. As you might have guessed, we've been having fun.  If you're new to the Europa Universalis series, you should know right at the start that it's more than just a complicated game of war. It's a sort of geo-political simulator that divides the world up into provinces, each ruled by a religion, a culture and, most significantly, a national power. These provinces provide tax revenue and manpower that you can use to fund technological research, build infrastructure or raise armies. Events play out day-by-day in real time so you'll have the immediate intensity of a real-time strategy game coupled with the high level strategizing of a classic 4X game. It's an intriguing synthesis but the scale and presentation of the game mean that it's not for everyone. Additionally, there are still some rough spots in the design that reach as far back as the original Europa games that continue to plague us.   In brief, the game allows you to select any starting date across over 250 years of Roman history, from the middle-Republic wars with Carthage to the civil wars that brought about the establishment of the Empire proper. Each date renders the political, economic and military situations as they existed at the time, so if you start early you'll find the Macedonians in alliance with their neighbors. If you progress a bit, you'll see them warring with the Aetolians. Progress even further and you'll see their territories being swallowed up by Rome. Although it probably contains a fair bit of ahistorical speculation and game balancing, the attention to detail here is considerable.  Once you've selected a starting date, you'll pick a nation to lead from among all the players, from Numidia to the Bosporan Kingdoms, from Egypt to Massilia. Of course, Rome and Carthage are the big players here, but you're free to try leading a lesser power as well. There are no set victory conditions; you're just expected to do the best you can with what you've got. In some cases, the best you can do is to hold on to what little power you set out with.  You'll need to raise armies, set trade routes, colonize barbarous provinces, appoint generals and governors, declare war, forge peace, manage alliances, blockade enemy ports, invoke omens, put down insurrections and pretty much anything else that a prospective world leader might have handled back in the ancient world. It's a tall order, but thankfully, the game can be paused so you can issue lots of orders at once.  The first Europa Universalis games buried the player under an avalanche of pop-up messages that literally stalled the game every few seconds. Players were forced to fine-tune their message settings to put a stop to all but the most essential interruptions. Now the team has finally struck the right balance, giving the important messages high visibility while also offering players a way to dig down into the details of systems that might not interest other people. There's even a new outline list at the top right of the screen that summaries you armies, navies and sieges so you can tell at a glance what's going on around the empire.   The designers have also abstracted several portions of the game to help ease the overall management crunch that plagued the first games. Technology research progresses regularly over time but instead of having to upgrade your existing infrastructure every generation, your new discoveries take the form of bonuses to your existing assets. And given the ancient history setting, you won't be worrying about dozens of different types of units here. Instead, you'll just have access to a few general types. They are still specific to each nation, so you'll have plenty of cultural flavor among the forces you're leading.  Since this isn't a game about tactics, there's no real interaction with the battles. You'll simply sit and watch the affair play out before your eyes courtesy of a small pop-up battle window. Here you can see the numbers and types of units involved, the commanders, terrain or skill modifiers, morale levels and the random die roll that influence the outcome. Even if you're just looking at the small animation on the game map itself, you can see the numbers of casualties floating up above the combatants' heads. But ultimately, this is all just window-dressing for the battles which you really have no input in whatsoever.  Some players will quite naturally be put off by this lack of control. They might argue that the game would be more fun if they could set general tactics or formations for each battle. But we think that's missing the point. Those types of interactions would, to our thinking at least, be out of place in a game of this scale. Here, the real test of your strategic mettle is whether or not you're creating balanced armies and putting them in the right places under the right commanders. While we thoroughly enjoy the tactical experience in games like Rome: Total War, that's not the type of experience that Paradox is going for in the Europa Universalis series and its inclusion would add a layer of management that would distract from the real purpose of the game.  There's a similar complaint to be leveled at the relatively indecisive nature of most of the battles. It's not uncommon to see only a few thousand casualties for battles involving twenty to thirty thousand units. And while it's historically accurate that an army will give up and run before allowing itself to be completely annihilated by the enemy, it does mean that the player will have to chase an enemy army across several provinces (or even back and forth across the same two provinces) before they can actually destroy them. Realistic as it might be, it can still get annoying, particularly when you happen to have an enemy completely surrounded and they still manage to break out.  If you're not careful about the loyalty of your generals and the happiness of your population, then you just might have a civil war on your hands. We've seen entire nations split in half over the mismanagement of resources and the popularity of a general with a big army. In our largest game a small group of rebels in a far corner of the Seleucid empire managed not only to carve out a nice slice of empire for themselves but over the course of a few generations, actually eliminate the entire Seleucid empire altogether. The cool thing about civil wars, depending on what side you're on, is that there's no room for peaceful coexistence between the sides so you can be sure that the conflict will rage until one or the other parties is completely destroyed.      But even with all the good, there are some definite flaws in this gem that are hard to look past. First army management is a huge pain and could benefit from some very simple tools. To begin with, there's no way to sort the units by type so if you want to know how much heavy infantry or cavalry you have in a given army, you have scroll through the whole list and count them. It's particularly aggravating because the second you enter a battle or a siege, you see a window right at the bottom that tells you how many of each troop type you have. If this information were available throughout the rest of the game, it would make army management much easier.  It's also unfortunate, not to mention altogether mystifying, that you can't manage your armies around a siege. Once your forces surround an enemy fort, you can just forget being able to do anything at all to organize them. It's true that you can select the individual armies in that province, but the siege window prevents you from seeing which of the armies you've selected. You can only tell that if you give them a move order. If you'd like to break a besieging army up to send a portion of the army off on another mission, you can only do so by actually lifting the siege entirely, reorganizing the units and then starting the siege all over again. It's a real time waster and a constant source of aggravation, particularly during wars where you're making lots of invasions.   There are general movement issues as well. To begin with, EU Rome suffers from the same movement resets that come whenever you decide to issue new orders to your units. Even with the game paused, you'll find yourself wasting a good few weeks of marching simply because you wanted to refine an army's destination. This occurs even when your change in orders sends a unit exactly where it was going in the first place, which is particularly obnoxious and has been throughout the entire life of this franchise. It helps to know where you're going in the first place, of course, but that's not always practical in the world of EU Rome.  I remember previous EU games had an option to synchronize the arrival of invading armies from different territories as well, but that has to be managed by hand in EU Rome. This means that you'll have to go ahead and order movement from both territories, check the arrival dates and hold back the faster army until you know their arrival time will match that of the other army.  The story elements in a character's history tab promised to be a really stunning new feature that let you see the events of an entire character's life summed up in a single page. And while it's definitely amazing to see the offices they held and the battles they won (or lost), the actual character event references are nearly impossible to decipher. We're sure they reference the events that pop up from time to time during the game, but what am I to make of a line that simply says ~It's pragmatism, not laziness in Why Do It Now?~ Obviously it references some key character event that I had to make some choice in but a little more information would definitely help to give it some meaning.  Diplomacy seems a bit hampered as well. To begin with, there really aren't enough options for increasing your standing with another nation, and it's entirely unclear why there should be so much animosity growing between you and nations that are on the other side of the world from you. Beyond that, the peace negotiations seem to be somewhat hampered by the inability to make allowances for third party interests. If, for example, you're negotiating as the head of an alliance, it's impossible for you to force the defeated nation to cede provinces to your allies. It's also similarly impossible to annex an entire nation if one of their core provinces is being held by another combatant.   Still, even with all these criticisms leveled against it, the fundamental appeal of leading an entire nation through a day-by-day simulation of war and diplomacy in the ancient world is more than enough to make up for the deficiencies and shortcomings. Your own chances of enjoying the game will depend on your ability to look past the few frustrating faults that the designers still haven't managed to shake.  The Europa Universalis games have always embraced a board-game style presentation with flat countries and a minimum of animation on the armies. But in this case, the artists have created a 3D map that shows real elevation as well as trees and other interesting geographical features. It still has a bit of a tabletop feel to it, but it suits the game well and offers a clear playing field. The armies themselves are also nicely detailed, from the weapons and armor they wear down to the straps on their sandals, and though the animations are a bit monotonous, they do add a bit of life to the game. The only thing that's truly missing from the game's visual presentation is a way to see the size of armies at a glance. Since they're all rendered a single ship or soldier, it can be easy to miss the buildup of forces along your borders.  The sound design in Europa Universalis Rome is generally quite good, but given the lengthy sessions the game demands, you're just as likely to switch to your own music after a while. The music cues in the game highlight the action nicely and the sound effects add another layer of life to the battles.Like the other games in the series, Europa Universalis Rome isn't for everyone. It isn't even for most people. But for the rare gamers who can happily lose themselves in a world where the ability to create armies is more valued than the ability to lead them on the field of battle, the EU games are a revelation. When you combine that approach with the appeal of the historical Roman setting, it's like an arrow of happiness aimed straight at our hearts.That said, we don't want to underemphasize the negative design decisions in Europa Universalis Rome. We're definitely disappointed that some of the presentation and army issues problems that have been continuing problems for this series have yet to be addressed. That the fun of the game can shine through even these repeated frustrations is a real sign that Paradox's overall concept is appealing. The one thing they have managed to finally get right is the level of information they provide the player and that's a tremendous improvement over the presentation problems of the previous games.", "date": "Apr 14, 2008"}
