My near nihilistic and apathetic sentiment is in fact due to a video game. Nexagon: Deathmatch is what I must refer to as an average strategy title that made me feel so little, aside from some brief pangs of anger from stupid unit AI and very brief joy in being able to destroy everything in an arena, that I am now almost completely devoid of emotion. Emptiness is a bad thing when it comes to video games. Games should inspire people to talk about them and discuss them. It's not that Nexagon is a completely horrific game with terribly bad ideas, it's just so unexciting in terms of pacing and art that there's nothing for me to really care about. It's a game stuck in limbo, destined to wander lost in the fog of bland design and gameplay.   Buh.   These kinds of games make me seriously envy sites that can feel free to write about whatever games they like to in detail or not. I'd really rather just sit here and say ~don't bother~ in about two sentences, which is really all this game needs, but I'm unfortunately bound by contract to actually explain why, when I have absolutely no interest in doing so. These limbo games are a pain in the ass to write about, as anybody that writes about them will be happy to tell you. Having good things to write about is great fun, and having bad things to write about can be even more fun given the circumstances. Unfortunately, this lifeless game gives me little opportunity to really brutally rag on their product while giving me no opportunity to present any real praise either. See where I'm going with this?   Nexagon has a simple enough premise that really only serves as a backdrop to the matches. The 25th century is very good. Technology is great, food is plentiful, and people are complacent and bored. Enter Nexagon. It gives the masses something to watch on TV every week as teams of criminals fight it out for the ultimate prize of freedom. The televised matches have announcers and sponsors as well as a crowd, which you can try to please in order to gain some more cash for future additions to your squad and sanctum (base). You control up to six units in each match, taken from the four unit choices present for each of the four different sides.  They all have basic strengths and weaknesses such as strong melee or ranged attacks, magic or special abilities, and so on. Matches last for three rounds set to a time limit and can be won by either scoring the highest number of points, managing to kill off all members of the opposite team (which is more difficult than it seems like it would be), or destroying the opposing team's nexus, a boring little globe of stuff that will regenerate fallen combatants (unless their injuries grow large enough that they die). Points are gathered through knocking enemy units out (so that they have to be re-spawned at the nexus) or capturing a billboard, which the ~sponsors~ for the match have placed around to advertise their wares.   Each of these arenas is made up of completely destructible pieces, which is a good idea, but just never has the fun and frolic that you would expect from such an environment. What they do provide are some interesting decisions as far as what pieces to destroy and what to leave standing to create alleys and choke points for enemies, since the enemy AI seems too stupid to destroy stuff to create their own new route. Found around the map are some extra credits, weapons, medical stashes, traps, and obstacles. The map designs themselves can be interesting at times, although some of them seem almost thrown together carelessly. For example, a couple of the maps allow ranged attack based armies to be almost completely invincible against melee based units due to some choke points from separate islands where units have to jump across. Sticking one unit where melee units would have to jump to in order to cross will stop any melee units from being able to get across, meaning ranged units defending the cross point can just sit there and take out any melee units that come up without fear of consequence (aside from their own stupid friends that will shoot them in the back). And when your side has nothing but melee units... well you see how things can get a bit difficult.   Each team has a sanctum that serves as a stronghold of sorts that can be constructed before the game begins (they give you more money in Skirmish so that you can build a more complete base right off the bat whereas in the campaign you'll have to increase it's strength slowly as you gain more money). These bases are built up of different parts including walls, blocks, energy gates, stashes of ammo, bombs and medical supplies, traps and weapons, and decorations all built around the nexus, which is what your competitors ultimately want to destroy. Most of the building pieces are functionally the same for each side with the exception of the weapons, traps, and decorations although each of the factions has a unique look to it. The decorations serve no real tactical advantage, but serve to entertain the crowd which will award you more money at the end of victories.    What this game needed in order for me to start thinking about it with more than half of my brain.   In very basic ways, Nexagon reminds me of Gladiators: Galactic Circus Games, which was released earlier this year. But that game had fun and colorful graphics, fast paced action, big explosions, and lots of units to bring violence against, which is what this type of game really has to have to be successful and as brutal as advertised. And while this game probably has a bit more ideas that lend to more strategic gameplay than Gladiators, it just didn't have the flash that you would expect in a future bloodsport TV show like this. Combine both of these titles together for different reasons and things might have been pretty decent for both.   I know that it isn't a high budget effort, but how am I supposed to get excited about what is supposed to be a hardcore battle when most of the explosions and special effects found throughout the game are so boring. If a game is going to be all about violence and destruction, make it convincing and stimulating at least. I need blood and dynamite here not skin flakes and sparklers.    Everything in each of the arenas, minus the floors, is destructible. So how is it that I was able to have so little fun destroying any of it? Could it be that the weapons themselves (for the units even carrying weapons) were just dull? Sure there was one exception, but the machine guns, energy weapons, and others were just boring. There was no big art showing them fire off from the guns... Could it be that while the structures fall down, it's with no real flair? Could it be the less than satisfying sounds accompanied by all of these occurrences? Could it be that it just took too long to destroy half of the objects for so little payoff? The answer is probably all of the above in some degree or another. It would have been nice to see particles spraying off the objects every time they were shot to give more of the feel that something is happening. There needs to be more than just a darkening texture to show damage being taken and maybe even some rubble and scars left on the ground after destruction takes place. Different explosions and/or animations when each of the types of objects are destroyed would also have been better.   The unit design is good enough that telling all of your guys apart is easy enough, even if the design isn't anything particularly exciting or new. Animations are average at best. Watching combat is nothing particularly special. Ranged units will shoot their guns and then engage in sloppily animated hand-to-hand combat, neither of which is really very satisfying.   One of the things that I actually liked about the gameplay was that units grow in experience throughout the game becoming veteran units that deal out and take more damage. But I really wish that, since you can only field 6 units at a time, units could have been upgraded by you after gaining experience in particular areas so that you could create an even more modified team to use each arena best. Being able to use more special abilities would have made things a bit more interesting.   Control in general for the game is really sketchy as well. First off, the interface needs some serious help. It's clunky and slow and offers no real help to players. Issuing commands to units sometimes don't actually get them to do anything and when it does, the results are mixed. Sometimes, you'll see units do smart things and pick good routes, but half the time, units will get very confused at choke points where not all of the units can fit through a certain area at once and will actually forget that the move order was even given in the first place. Pathfinding can be really atrocious, which I suppose isn't completely surprising given the ever changing nature of the landscape, but if you want your units to go somewhere specifically, you'll have to give waypoint orders or they'll go some convoluted way.   Best of all, when your ranged units do get where you told them to go, half the time they'll start shooting their own guys in the back when trying to get a shot off at an enemy. This was the only thing that truly, truly pissed me off in the game. Units too stupid to move to a position where they could fire unobstructed at an enemy, or just not fire at all, make me want to shove needles under my toenails. Better yet, if you give orders for ranged units to attack units or structures that other units are already attacking, they'll sometimes close to melee range, running right into the line of fire or all the other units, hurting and often knocking him back to the nexus. LAME! Most of the deaths I had each game were direct results of friendly fire. I mean, it's like punching the friend that's holding you back in the head when you're really trying to slug the guy hitting on your girlfriend. That's just not cool. Or at least that's what they tell me.Let me sum it all up for you. Don't bother. It's really not deep or visually exciting enough to keep you interested. While there's nothing quite exactly like the game currently on store shelves, there are still plenty of better strategy games that will keep your interest a lot longer.", "date": "Aug 6, 2003"}
