This is no easy task, but this Bits Studios developed offering manages to mimic the formula that worked for its predecessors well enough and as a result some of its play scenarios and objectives are intriguing, fun and ultimately satisfying. That said, Rogue Ops lacks the originality and, more importantly, polish of the games it strives to be -- and no amount of heroine sexiness or humorous one-liners can make us ignore that.  The Facts  Play as agent Nikki Conners, an assassin out to revenge the deaths of her husband and daughter Mission success in Rogue Ops relies on undetected operations. Players can hide in the shadows, suspend from ceilings, seek refuge inside environmental objects like storage lockers or slide against walls to peer around corners Heightened enemy AI. When alerted, enemies investigate suspicious behavior and circumstances. Once enemies go to full alert, they never return to routine patrol Eight action-packed missions featuring challenging objectives in eight diverse environments. Engaging dialogue advances the plot through surprising twists and revelations Extensive arsenal. Nikki's weapons include pistol, shocker, sniper rifle, crossbow, shuriken, smoke bomb, frag grenade, jamming grenade, remote mine and proximity mine. Depending on the circumstances, players must choose weapons that will not set off alarms or draw attention Cutting-edge spy tools. Field innovations include retina scanner, V.I.S.E.R., fly cam, thermal optical camouflage, adrenaline boost, communication system and grapple hook. Limited battery power on some devices helps balance game play and strategy Cinematically scored soundtrack. Dramatic music and realistic audio effects elevate the intensity of this amazing game experience   Gameplay Rogue Ops is drenched in all of the usual cliches. Main character Nikki Conners is the typical videogame female -- she's voluptuous, good with guns and perpetually pissed off. We suppose she has every right to be. After all, as the opening story illustrates via noticeably-too-compressed full-motion video sequences, her husband and daughter have both recently been murdered and now she's on a revenge mission. The ex-Green Beret joins up with a covert government agency and decides to spend her days and nights chasing after members of Omega 19, a terrorist organization she believes is responsible for the demise of her would-be happy home. The story seems to parallel those of too many forgotten cheesy B-movies. We have the tough but also conveniently pretty blonde beauty with something to prove. We have the gruff unit commander who walks, talks and looks like Sylvester Stallone. And we have a wealth of overwritten and overacted cop talk-like dialogue.   The setup in place isn't particularly compelling. We were more intrigued by the also-overused premise that powered Splinter Cell and Ubisoft's game had an added benefit in that it oozed style. But on the other hand the presentation isn't poor, either. In fact, Bits Studios has done a fine job of implementing humor elements into the mix. While training for her missions to come, for instance, Conners guns down mock human targets and in one such cut-scene the camera pulls back and reveals dozens of bullet holes in the display's head and groin area. Not exactly subtle, but it made us smile.  The game itself, though, can be surprisingly fun and clever, if something of a clone. Play revolves around Nikki, who can do just about everything that Sam Fisher or Solid Snake can. As the character advances through the game's eight well-designed levels (plus one training mission) she'll stealthily sneak by guards, creep up behind and then execute them, climb and shimmy across ledges and pipes, crawl underneath laser trip wires, use a wide variety of gadgets from X-Ray vision to thermal-vision and floating cameras, pick up and move dead bodies into shadowy hiding places (or, err, lockers), and more. She'll also put to use an impressive selection of guns from long-distance sniper rifles to automatics, explosives and yes, even shurikens.  Most of these operations are adequately implemented though sometimes clumsily controlled. A dual-stick configuration moves Conners around and simultaneously enables full movement of the camera. She can harness her weapons and zoom in or out with a scope view using the trigger keys. The face buttons do everything else from selecting special items to choosing alternate weapons and utilizing gadgets. Slinking around, hiding from enemies and scoping in on them feels very solid. In fact, the stealth elements -- highly entertaining and atmospheric -- are what the game does best. Manipulating the spy camera through structural shafts is very cool. On the other hand, high-action sequences suffer greatly as Conners -- hardly acrobatic -- moves slowly around the environments and the framerate, which is inconsistent at best, hardly helps the situation. With that in mind, it's during some shoot-outs with terrorists that players may notice an unfortunate lack of control polish -- a truth that puts a significant dent in the overall experience.  Sneak unto enemies and perform a death move like this -- you'll see their skeleton when the crushing blow is dealt  Rogue Ops definitely borrows some ideas, but it also brings a few welcomed innovations to the party. As the heroine manipulates the levels, players can make her perform different object-specific actions correlated to a mostly-intuitive icon system displayed on-screen. When Nikki approaches a ledge, for example, a green icon will indicate whether or not she can descend down it, and if so all players need do is press the action button and they're off. The icon system is very dynamic and flexible, which impresses. It is used in the game to do everything from opening doors to searching the bodies of dead guards for helpful pick-ups, from setting bombs to making the character shoot off her grapple hook so that she can ascend walls. On the other hand, though, the icon system doesn't always work, which can be frustrating. Sometimes players may not realize where to go or what to do because icons only appear when objects have been moused-over, so to speak, and as a result gamers may waste far too much time exploring rooms over again in a state of confusion. This can be a significant problem because the icon system is embedded into areas located throughout each and every level.      The title includes a remarkably well realized sneak-and-kill ability that successfully puts a fresh spin on an old idea. Conners -- like Fisher or Snake -- can quietly advance unto an enemy and dispose of them. However, in Ops this procedure is more defined due to a circle graph that challenges players to first press their control stick in a series of pre-determined directions in order to trigger a very satisfying scripted death move. If players can do it, they will easily kill their foe -- and in a stylized, very enjoyable manner. If they mess up, the enemy will instead take down Nikki. This addition adds both depth and a tangible layer of intensity to the task.  The missions in Rogue Ops are nicely designed and challenging, for the most part. It definitely doesn't start off slow; rather, the difficulty is apparent from the beginning. After we completed the game's first two levels, we felt a real sense of accomplishment in having figured out the environmental puzzles while fending off enemies and stealthily pursing our objectives. However, not all of the scenarios are compelling and, indeed, with some of the control and icon-related drawbacks, some tasks can become frustrating and even tedious. Thankfully the game is respectful of goals met and will not restart players at the beginning of a level, but at a post shortly after their last completed objective.  Graphics Did main character Nikki Conners really need a visual makeover? Did she really need to go from brunette to blonde? We don't know. The main character, in our opinion, still looks too similar to every other videogame bombshell. She's part Joanna Dark and part Lara Croft and as a result she looks like a generic version of both. But geeks worldwide will be pleased to know that she does, at least, have a nice butt.  The visuals in the game have a very Bits Studios look to them -- one that we associate with the first-person shooter Die Hard Vendetta, which not coincidentally was also created by the company. The worlds that Nikki runs through are large and varied. We have military installations. We have kingpin hideouts. We have government facilities. We have museums. We have indoor and outdoor environments. The variation is commendable. There is a respectable amount of level geometry to look at it. Textures can be detailed and crisp in places, but oppositely they can also be downright ugly. See the game's third level sky background for proof: the clouds like look something a mentally challenged kindergartener might smear on himself after lunch.  The camera is usually competent and character animation is acceptable, but not dazzling.   The game has a certain style to it, though. It works. The gadget effects look great. The night vision, camera, sniper scopes -- they're all very ambient. Meanwhile everything from the laser trip wires to the dark and shadowy tunnels that Nikki may sometimes explore is graphically intriguing. This isn't Splinter Cell quality, but it's not bad, especially on Xbox, which supports better shadowing and lighting effects. What is, disappointing, however, is the game's fluidity on GameCube and PS2, which reaches for 30 frames per second but rarely achieves it. The game bogs down considerably in large environments to the point where the motion can directly interfere with aiming. The Xbox build is better, but still dips here and there. This title does not run in progressive scan on GameCube or PS2 -- an oversight.  Crawl underneath laser trip wires to reach goals Sound The voice acting in Rogue Ops is over-cooked. The actors cannot act and their delivery -- mixed with the already suspect dialogue -- simply doesn't work. The Xbox and PS2 builds at least feature proper audio compression in cut-scenes, but the GameCube build suffers from a tinny, muted presentation. This is not true of the sounds in the actual game, thankfully. The music is appropriate and sometimes highly atmospheric, while the sound effects -- from the thud-thud-thud of the automatics to the booms of the explosions -- are deep and satisfying.Rogue Ops tries desperately to be the next Splinter Cell, or even the next Metal Gear Solid, but the game lacks both the mechanical polish and visual splendor to achieve that lofty goal. That's not to say that it's not a fun little offering all the same, though, because in my opinion it is. Flawed, but fun.The title's untrained framerate and decidedly clumsy (but wholly functional) controls put a definite hamper on the experience and yet I had a good time exploring the levels, sneaking past enemies, using my night vision and advancing through the surprisingly clever environmental puzzles.Definitely worth a rental, if nothing else.
