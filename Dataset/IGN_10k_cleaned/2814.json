Street Fighter Alpha 3 has taken just about forever in development, the mass of SNK fighters that could have easily reigned on the handheld have been no-shows aside from a weak KOF, and Nintendo has neglected its own system by not giving Super Smash Bros. Melee a GBA cousin. It's gotten to the point where niche games like Medabots AX, which is in some ways less a fighter than it is a hyperactive Pokmon game, start looking like challengers. Too bad the game is stretch too far to really knuckle up.  Features  Build your Medabots for battle with hundreds of different combat parts Collect and trade Medabot parts -- many exclusive to the different versions of the game Fight other GBA players in 2-player Medabot battles Only for Game Boy Advance   Part platformer, part fighting game, part pocket monster battler -- Medabot AX  games (released in Metabee and Rokusho versions, nearly identical except for the starting bots and different weapons/items you can win and trade between the two different editons) has what could have been a lethal combo. The game is based on a frenzied Japanese TV series about kids who build robots and fight them against other kids' robots. It dispenses with the negligible story of the series in favor of the player just going in and kicking ro-butt over and over again against a series of faceless and recognizable foes.  Unfortunately, that's not all the game gets rid of to get to the fight quick. There's no training mode or story feature, or any kind of lead-in at all to get you into the game. There's not even an options menu. You're just thrown into the mix, with only a 36-page manual to give you any clue what's going on. Granted, the battles themselves seem like they should be self-explanatory -- fight to the death and don't get killed. Yet with a set-up menu for your robots that's more shiny than it is helpful (one stat in a field of numbers is marked ~Number~, which you're supposed to recognize as the amount of special weapons you get ... yeah, save the manual), it'll take a long time before you get the screwy logic behind this game's layout. Why do you have to click on ~Exit~ to enter a battle? Just keep playing until something starts to make sense.  But will you want to keep playing the game long enough to get it? Not sure. Natsume hasn't got a clunker on its hands with Medabots AX -- there's a ton to do and practice in the game -- but the developers got so busy trying to fit in trick moves and specials gadgets that it never got solid basics in there. Gameplay here is sort of more like a Mega Man game with fighting than it is a Super Smash Bros. brawler, since you've got dozens of customizable weapons and attacks but not much for mano-a-mano fisticuffs. The variety of attacks in battle is pretty slim -- just three moves, plus a mega-attack -- but you've got tons of possible defensive and offensive attacks to assign to your robot. Shooting weapons, slashing swords, super punches, regenerative power-ups, armored treads, ice inhibitors, and many other types of battle devices are available. The idea is to achieve the balance between yourself and your partner (do you make a speedy basher for yourself and team with a healer, or go with a heavy-armor brute and a long-range bomber cohort, or go with two balanced killers?) in relation to whom you're fighting and what the battleground is.  The only problem is that it's not much of a fighting game. It's an alright robot battler game, since you've got so many options and choices in battle and a few different methods of strategy (if your opponent's partner is a healer, for example, you'll waste a lot of energy taking down his teammate since the buddy will often fix his damage), but the fundamentals aren't fun to fight with. No matter how much strategy you lay out, many battles seem just plain random -- the enemy AI will either be on the ball or off its game. It doesn't help a ton in multiplayer since the helper bot still relies on funky AI. (Strangely, four-player multiplayer fighting isn't an option even though it would have been perfect for the gameplay.) If you try to go deep into it the fighting elements, the game will let you down. The point of the gameplay, for example, is to knock out the enemy by shutting off their head component (the whole body can be damaged individually by legs, both weapon arms and head), but direct shots to the head don't seem to help damage that part of the body. Instead of masterful fighting of technique and timing, everything boils down to careful, strategic button mashing.So much in this game left me raw that I have a real hard time recommending it. The menus and dialog sequences are no help in figuring out what's going on, and the Japanglish text is no good either. It doesn't give you any assistance in figuring out what to do when not everything on your robo-squad is set up right -- just flashes an error message. The difficulty can be rabid, although all you really need to do is battle endlessly, leveling up and collecting more stuff to win with. Technique isn't as much a factor as you'd expect. Bottom line is that the game is more an RPG squeezed into a fighting engine than it is a fighter with RPG features. They didn't even put the life bars in the upper corners the way they do in every single fighter out there -- I kept looking at my partner's life bar and thinking I was doing fine just seconds before I was blown away. It's just not a fighter at heart.At first, it seemed fun jumping about and blasting away at my foes with a constantly growing arsenal. After a while, though, the weapons were not adding to the fun, and the game wasn't all that fun to start with (especially since you'll spend a while in the start not knowing what's going on anyway.) The brawling isn't tight or technical, and becoming a master is a matter of perfecting cheap shots. Medabots fanatics may get a few good rounds out of the sharp visuals and kabillions of available weapons, and the game is essentially very playable. It's just not very much a fighter -- they just subbed in a platform shooter/brawler engine for the RPG menus. There's a point in the game's battles when, if you're losing, you'll find yourself dismantled with no weapons except a weak punch to take on your opponents. That'd be ridiculously unfair in a real fighting game, leaving a bloody and broken pulp to fend off still armed foes, and it's no fun here either. Fight fans, even those ready to try a different kind of brawling like that in Medabots AX, may find this game to be a bit like that limp-wristed bag of bolts with so many weapons in its arsenal but none when you really get down to the bottom of it all. It's got no good punch.", "date": "Jul 25, 2002"}
