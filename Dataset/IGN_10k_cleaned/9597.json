It's been a long time coming and changed hats along the way, but now that the slate is covered with newly recovered logos, is Tabula Rasa the earth-shattering new MMO experience we've all been waiting for?   Let's make a character first, one we'll be satisfied with because there is none of that sludgy, ugly look here that seems to have crept its way into more than a couple games in recent times. You can make some seriously attractive (or ridiculous, if you like facial hair) characters in Tabula Rasa, choosing the face, hairstyle, and height among other things, as well as the design and color of your basic armor even though you'll be throwing it over for new gear ASAP.   Choose a last name wisely, as this stays constant over your entire account. Any character you create or clone will be part of one big, happy (and good-lookingcall me superficial!) family of Allied Free Sentient recruits. The cloning bit comes in as one of Tabula Rasa's main contributions to MMO awesomeness of the future: no more starting from scratch to try out a different branch of the skill tree. Theoretically, you should have to level only your first creation from one to five. Every time you're ready to rank up, a clone token will be presented so you can take a snapshot of your reputation, missions completed, and level. Then you can make a sibling to your main character, who comes with some basic medical supplies and all the unallocated skill points you would've acquired leveling up.    It makes sense that that's all they come with, but if you haven't been planning for their arrival, you'll be kicking yourself.  Footlockers located at major bases allow easy storage and transferal of equipment, so don't forget to save armor and weapons, and maybe sock away some cash as well. Otherwise your level 15 Commando clone will wake up in his jammies with only his sunglasses to his name, instead of packing serious firepower like he should be.     The skill tree, by the way, should be enough to chew on, with eight ultimate classes attainable by level 30 of 50: Grenadier, Guardian, Sniper, Spy, Demolitionist, Engineer, Medic, and Exobiologist. These are trained in turn from the Commando, Ranger, Sapper, and Technician jobs, which ranked up from the Soldier and Specialistthe level 5 split. The Soldier side of the tree tends more towards guns, with the highest classes dedicated to heavy firepower, range and stealth, while the Sapper branch is more about tools, healing, and otherwise messing with nature or machinery. Each end class features a signature ~wave~ ability that uses an entire bar of adrenaline, which, like rage in other games, is built up over the course of battle.   An equally useful thing built up over the course of battle is your XP multiplier, another bit of Tabula Rasa shiny awesome. As an incentive for really putting your ass on the line, i.e. plunking yourself down on the frontlines surrounded by Thrax (who, incidentally, are busying themselves by taking over the universe, despite the efforts of the good aliens, the Eloh) and serving them all a complimentary laser luncheon, you'll get another 25% added XP every few kills. Tall tales have related 600% XP, but personally I've always run out of guys to slaughter at around 250%. Motivation for a death wish!   Actually, a death wish is almost mandatory if you're going to be soloing in this game. From both my experience and talking with other players, it seems like you have to be one hell of a crafty grinder to make it through on your own. The penalty for dying is five minutes of res sickness-- stackable, though, so you don't want to be in too much of a hurry to get beat down again unless you are using res trauma kits, readily from the hospital store near your respawn.      Combat can be interesting. Personally, I found it to be more so at range, to take advantage of the fact that it is, indeed, shooter-esque; I was grooming my main fellow, Tristan Ohmikai, to be a Sniper. Standing next to a guy shooting him sort of negates the whole cover system to the point where you might as well be in some other game whacking away with a sword. That said, Spies are the only class who actually use a blade, but there are melee moves available to anyone--especially handy for literally kicking enemies in their death throes to pieces in an XP bonus-bestowing finisher.    To be able to use your special powers, even if you have the skill points to level them up, you need to hunt out logos, symbols from the Eloh language. For instance, the Specialist power ~Decay~ requires the two logos: Damage, which looks sort of like a hammer breaking a block, and Time, an hourglass shape. These symbols are also featured in signs throughout the game, and there is at least one quest that requires the player to translate a sentence (or just bother the general chat.)       Most of the time, quests seem fairly hum-drum. I do appreciate the humor (hopefully) implied in the naming of the noob-classed ~Boargar~ enemies. Of course, tagging something completely mundane with ~gar~ makes it instantly alien and refreshing, thus rendering it a supremely engaging ~kill x~ quest, wink. Expect to do some escorting, some collecting of plants and other biological materials, and other familiar quest formulas.   There are more compelling missions to be taken, however, including some of the ethical choice variety. Should you turn in the drug runner, or run his drugs? Feed the prisoner, or starve him for info? Turn in the deserter, or allow him to conscientiously object? The outcome of these early ones hasn't really shaped my destiny quite yet, but maybe it gets more serious as you go further on, or maybe playing as a good guy just doesn't have so many consequences.     Instances sometimes come with their own intro cut-scenes and are meant to be grand story-telling gestures, the likes of which Garriott thought were hard to come by outside of more traditional single player RPGs. This didn't quite come across to me during my playtime, and whether it's because hardcore players tend to min-max their runs or because our squads had a hard time figuring out what exactly we were supposed to be doing, things felt pretty normal in terms of what to expect from the instanced gameplay.   What is even more compelling, as well as fresh and fun when not inconvenient, are the checkpoints. Foreas (your first planet) is enveloped in pretty much constant fighting, with Thrax being beamed down from dropships, patrolling the trails, stomping around their bases, andon occasiontaking over certain bases. When the alarm goes off, players have to either muster a defense force or watch their waypoint (crucial for omitting long treks through dangerous territory via teleporation), shopkeepers, and quest givers fall. Once the base is under enemy control, it'll take some at least semi-organized squads to bring it back.     On one hand, it lends a lot of urgency to the fighting. Defending your home turf is one way to get fired up, plus you're rewarded with defense or assault tokens for your trouble (of which the most meticulous players need a hundred each, along with many other tedious objectives called ~Targets of Opportunity,~ to earn an extra clone token.) On the other hand, it can be a pain to have the base come under attack when you just stopped by to do something quick and then got roped into a whole defense operation. Once I logged out of a control point, returning to find myself trapped (since the force fields change to evil red) inside the base now crawling with Thrax. This was funnier than anything, though, since I was dead in under a minute and the problem is easily avoided by logging out from a stable location.    Besides questing, you can choose to duel your fellow AFS recruits PvP style, which so far is pretty bland, or you can get into crafting. Crafting, however, is not really addressed in the manual, much less the tutorial, so you'll have to ask around before finally figuring out that you need to deconstruct unneeded weapons and armor for parts to make the recipes enemies sometimes drop. There are also base level skills you can put points into in order to loot certain materials from enemies, but they won't help you unless you know to deconstruct as well. Unfortunately, the whole system feels pretty after-the-fact, and isn't really worthwhile unless you're that determined to mix your own armor paint or add hand-made buffs to your equipment.     The overall atmosphere of the game is great. MMOs are meant to be accessible so you won't find amazing DX10 graphics here, but what is there is aesthetically pleasing, if not always easy to navigate. Sometimes the waypoints could be placed better, especially in the case where your object is in a cave underground. I'd much rather have the entrance marked, at least until I get down there. Otherwise you've trekked out to the middle of nowhere only to realize that the goal is buried under your feet somewhere.    You also have the bizarre flora bloom effect that has replaced ~popping~ in, in some games, but at least the sprouting is fun to watch. We've already discussed how cool the characters look, but the aliens are equally well designed.    Funny AP announcements in the main bases such as, ~Attention all personal, tonight's movie is a hold over from last week and will be shown after dinner, which is also a holdover from last week,~ are a good way to counteract all the repetitive (yet distinct to weapon type) gun shots. The music is pretty chill for the most party, rockish. The theme that plays out in the field is very comfortable for traveling, so you don't have to worry about becoming annoyed.    While there are some buggy moments, and some interface frustrations (Edit: It was pointed out you can scroll back and forth between skills using the shift key. We apologize for the inaccuracy, but note the minor quibble does not affect the score.) they aren't enough to severely hamper your experience, and many of them will certainly be resolved in the near future. Tabula Rasa probably isnt the best MMO to cut your teeth on, but that doesnt mean its a bad game. Its rather frustrating by yourself, though, unless youre the Rambo type who wants to grind until they can solo instances meant for a full squad. Even just traveling around the worlds can be perilous alone, so itd be better to go in with some friends on board from the get-go, if you can. While not a completely revolutionary game, Tabula Rasa does add features such as the cloning system and dynamic battlefield that perhaps start building the bridge to that next evolution of MMO. The original sci-fi story also helps distinguish it from others of the genre, but rather than obliterating the old dirt road and starting entirely from scratch, Tabula Rasa takes what has been laid out and travels a little further.", "date": "Nov 21, 2007"}
