However, the game, which is published by license-gobbler Activision and developed by Traveller's Tales (A Bug's Life), has quite a bit going for it all the same. Original level design, intuitive control and lots to do work well to present the Toy Story license to Nintendo 64 owners. The main problem is that the 64-bit incarnation of the game is nothing more than a PlayStation port -- and a bad one at that.  The Facts   Based on the popular Toy Story 2 feature film. 15 huge 3D polygonal worlds to explore. Every day environments transformed into giant levels. Five bosses to do battle with. A wide arsenal of moves including everything from somersaults to jumping and shooting. Accessories to boost player performance. Rumble Pak support. Static images highlight action. Single-player. Port of PlayStation game of the same name.   Gameplay The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions of Toy Story 2 are exactly the same in design. Players control Buzz Lightyear, the Tim Allen voiced astronaut hero from the movie, on a quest to save his pal Woody (Tom Hanks) from an evil prospector named Zurg. The action is pretty straightforward. The idea is to travel through each different area, collecting tokens by completing specific tasks. Each level generally has three or four different ways to collect these tokens, including everything from racing to fighting a boss and, of course, just picking them up along the way. The experience is commendably deep, especially for a licensed game of this nature, offering gargantuan worlds to fully explore, lots of mini-tasks to run through and plenty simplistic, but nonetheless fun puzzles to keep gamers busy.  As Lightyear, players possess certain abilities that regularly help them through the adventure. We're talking everything from the standard jump, run, and shoot stuff to climbing polls, swinging across wires, rocketing upwards, grappling objects and executing damaging torso spins. The character is definitely equipped. Control is tight and generally intuitive, though the standard control configuration leaves a little to be desired. Players make Buzz deliver a butt-stomp of sorts, for example, not by pressing the Z-trigger as one might imagine, but rather by pressing C-down. Not terribly annoying, but perhaps proof all the same that developer Traveller's Tales is not familiar with traditional Nintendo 64 platformer control configurations.  Activision has all the makings of a winning formula here. Solid gameplay mechanics, top control and huge, challenging levels to deal with. The only problem is that it's all brought together as a shoddy, bothersome port, and it shows primarily in the graphics department.  Graphics Toy Story 2 is a crisp, colorful, wonderfully rich and extraordinarily detailed 3D platformer with a fluid framerate 99% of the time -- for PlayStation. For Nintendo 64, Toy Story 2 is a blurry, clunky 3D platformer choked by an inconsistent framerate that never fails to annoy -- and actually has a bearing on gameplay. Developer Traveller's Tales needs to realize that PlayStation and Nintendo 64 are two very different machines and program accordingly. There is no reason why this game should not run just as smoothly as its PlayStation counterpart.   Worse, objects and characters in the game seem to fade into an alternate dimension (which we'll call ~Dimension X~ for the purposes of this review) the further away players progress from them. In the first level, for example, a lawn mower rides around out of control. Once it reaches a certain distance from players, it disappears off of the screen entirely, where we can only imagine it is happily mowing lawns in Dimension X, oblivious to our universe. This, of course, is pop-up, but it's very bad pop-up -- and it's all topped off with a poor framerate, which it's supposed to be eliminating in the first place.  We played both the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 version of Toy Story 2 when preparing for this review and, quite frankly, the 32-bit version of the game looks leaps and bounds better. More importantly, though, it controls more accurately and that's because it features a better sense of fluidity. Throw in the fact that the PlayStation version also features loads of FMV cut-scenes from the movie (as compared to the Nintendo 64's blurry static images) and it's easy to see where Traveller's Tales priorities were.  Sound The game features the musical renditions of Randy Newman's Toy Story music mixed with cheery, happy, smiley style of tunes that scream, ~Hey, whoa -- I'm a platformer.~ It all works just the same. Each song, not dynamic by any means, matches the environment it is played through and that's good enough for us. Sound effects, meanwhile, are equally fitting. Characters shout ~Buzz!~ upon encountering our hero, and we of course have a selection of laser fires, grunts, jump sounds, swinging and explosions that represent the Toy Story movies they are mimicking quite nicely. Nothing is particularly great, but none of it's poor either.  The Nintendo 64 is the system of choice for platform junkies for good reason -- it features the very best. From Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie to Rocket: Robot on Wheels and Rayman 2: The Great Escape, you won't find better. Traveller's Tales rough port of its solid PlayStation platformer (which still, mind you, is not on the same level as the aforementioned N64 games), simply can't compete with what we've got already. While Toy Story 2 admittedly boasts intuitive controls and tried-and-true platformer mechanics (that work), the Nintendo 64 version of the game is hampered by a poor framerate, washed out visuals and a decidedly blurry look when compared to its PlayStation counterpart. It's not difficult to ascertain that developer Traveller's Tales isn't focused on Nintendo 64 software -- only porting it as fast as possible.In the end, this is an extremely flawed port of a good PlayStation platformer. If you own a PlayStation already, we recommend you pick up the 32-bit version of Toy Story 2 -- it's leagues better than the Nintendo 64 hand-me-down. If you're just looking for an excellent platformer for Nintendo 64, see any of the above N64 games mentioned as this, unfortunately, isn't it.", "date": "Nov 13, 1999"}
