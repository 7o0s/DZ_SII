In Greek mythology, the giant bronze robot Talos guarded Crete by running around the island three times every day and pelting intruders with stones. In Norse folklore, the clay giant Mistcalf aided the troll Hrunginiar against the god Thor in battle. And in Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots, an army of evil toys is planning to take over the world and it's up to you to stop them.   Set in the Nicktoon universe, THQ and Nickelodeon's latest cash-cow is fairly simple in concept. The evil Dr. Calamitous is out to prove that he is the world's biggest genius by creating a vast legion of evil toys that will conquer the earth. These toys are robotic clones of various Nicktoon heroes that have been kidnapped and harvested for their DNA. The few Nicktoons that manage to escape, like Spongebob SquarePants and his friend Patrick, decide to bust into Dr. Calamitous' evil toy lab and save their friends.    Attack of the Toybots is a relatively short game, with only five levels to explore and a couple of achievements to be had. While making your way through each level of the laboratory you can switch back and forth between two Nicktoon characters, which doesn't change your gameplay experience that much but does feature different pithy one-liners from each character, delivered by the AAA voice actors. You can also attain special powers for you Nicktoons and pick up an oozinator which liven things up a bit. The controls are easy to master, and are in sync with some of the more cleverly designed levels. There's also a two player co-op feature that allows you and a friend to shoot teddy bears together.    In essence Attack of the Toybots is simple but fun, although there are some issues that come up in gameplay. One is that the levels take too long to complete. It takes at least a good fifteen to twenty minutes to complete one, and isn't going to keep a child's attention for that long. And although you can duck back into the dungeons at any of six points to grab items you missed once you've beaten them, by then you're bored with the gameplay. Another issue that comes up is the A.I. for your second Nicktoon character, who will shadow you as you move from place to place. This is so you can go up to the other character and switch roles, but while moving forward you're dim-witted sidekick will wander off platforms or get shredded by metal gears (though they'll reappear again after a few seconds).     Other hiccups in the game include more serious glitches, like a character walking on air instead of a platform, and the camera being anchored in one place so it's hard to gage distance when jumping. These things don't make the game unplayable, but it does show the limited amount of time and effort put into the product.    There's not much to say about the graphics. They're not mind-blowing, but they're not bad either, and the colors are bright and cheery. The music is actually very well-done, with a sinister remix of Teddy Bear's Picnic for one level and a jazzy dance tune on another.Nicktoons: Attack of The Toybots is by no means a stellar game, but if you're a parent looking to entertain your kid for a few hours while you go out, then this might do the trick. Otherwise pass on this and wait for something better.", "date": "Nov 19, 2007"}
