That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born. On the surface Die by the Sword looks like an ordinary fighting game.  From the screenshots, you'd guess it's a medieval fantasy version of Tekken using a primitive 3D engine.  In fact, this is how it plays if you use the default ~arcade~ controls.  In fact, the great irony of Die by the Sword is its arcade mode.  It was probably included to make the game accessible to the casual player, but it also made it dull by glossing over its greatest strength.  How many people must have given up on this game after installing it and futzing around with the arcade controls?  Swing.  Block.  Hack.  Slash.  Yawn.  Uninstall.But if they had flipped through the little manual or stuck it out through the end of the tutorial, they would have discovered that the heart of Die by the Sword is an ambitious experiment in physics and interface.  It was a new way to play a fighting game and a remarkable advance in how games could truly earn the description ~immersive~.  To see what's really going on here, you have to enable something called VSIM (which doesn't stand for anything according to its creators).  This is an interface in which you use the controller to specify where you want to move your weapon.  Some people swear by the joystick or mouse -- there's even support for force feedback joysticks -- but I prefer the keyboard.  For instance, if you're using the keyboard, the numbers on the keypad control the position of your weapon.  If you press the upper right button, the sword moves up and to the right.  If you then press the lower left button, the sword moves down and to the left, making a diagonal slash in the process.  You attack by moving your character so that an opponent is caught in the path of that slash.The result is very much like puppeteering.  Instead of an attack button that triggers scripted animations, you get a sense for using your fingers to directly control the 3D model.  It's awkward at first.  In fact, it's still awkward once you're good at it.  And it can be exhausting, since you use your fingers in a way that few other games require.  A friend of mine calls it the ~carpel tunnel game~.  But it's extremely rewarding once you've gotten used to how different it is.When you're playing a typical fighting game, there's something disassociative about pressing a button to make your character kick or punch.  If you know the language of video games, you feel a little more involved when you can chain the moves together to create combos.  For instance, we all know double tapping backwards or forwards while pressing attack is going to do something.  But you don't feel connected so much as you feel like you're sending instructions that the computer will interpret.  There's a very definite layer between you and the guy on the screen, something straining and warping the signals between your fingertips and the animation. Die by the Sword is different, as if the keys were strings.  You can see where your sword is and where it's going to go next.  When you can't swing it, you see why -- it's caught against the other guy's sword or maybe you don't have room.  You can tell when a blow is going to connect.  There's a sense of really using the weapon, working it into a gap between the other guys sword arm and shield or rearing back to bring it down hard.  This is physics at its best, before Trespasser made it a dirty word.  It is a direct interface that really earns the word ~immersive~: it is getting inside the game where you're usually not allowed.It's not elegant.  It's not like the swordfight in Princess Bride or anything you'll see in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  There's a lot of strategy to it, but not much flair.  The best early move to learn is just swinging a sword back and forth at waist level as if you were harvesting wheat.  From here, you start to pick up timing issues, like when the sword will hit or miss and how to run past someone while they're recovering from a swing so you can catch their unprotected side.  Eventually you'll start aiming at wounded areas on your opponent, trying to lob off limbs.  Sometimes you'll close in and clinch with the other guy like a tired boxer.  Sometimes you'll accidentally win.  But it will be like no other fighting game you've ever played.There's a quest mode which is basically an excuse to string together fights.  Although the developers at Treyarch had some good ideas (shrinking potion, a baby monster that think you're its mother, foreshadowing with cutscenes), they also were guilty of some of the same old  clichs (a tedious maze, a few horrid jumping puzzles, damsel in distress).  Each level has a scoring system based on whether you met certain objectives, some of which are hidden until you accomplish them.  It actually adds a touch of replayability to the single player game.  Although the 3D engine looks pretty ugly, it is at times ambitious.  Two years ago, it was a respectable attempt at real time shadows.  The animation and creature design can be creepy and amusing.  The sound deserves special mention, with memorable taunts and ingame commentary, effective monster noises, and a particularly gratifying wet pulpy thump of weapons against flesh.This is all put to much better use in the game's arena mode, in which you can fight as the different creatures and characters, choosing your character, your opponents, and your arena.  In the original Die by the Sword, there are precious few actual arenas, but you can play them in a gauntlet mode that pits you against waves of increasingly difficult enemies.  The expansion pack, Limb from Limb, adds a new quest, several new arenas, and some welcome new modes like King of the Hill, in which you have to fight enemies back from a flag to score points and win.  Limb from Limb also adds Ogre Hockey, in which the game's most powerful creatures fight to knock a chittering kobold into the other teams goal.  Ogre Hockey requires more precision than the game engine offers, but it's certainly good for a few laughs.  Unfortunately, Die by the Sword is not very lag tolerant, so to really enjoy the multiplayer support, you need a LAN.There have been many games in the style of Die by the Sword.  Eidos' Deathtrap Dungeon, Psygnosis' Drakan, and G.O.D.'s Rune are all swordplay games, but with simplified combat.  Even the recently released Oni, which boasts a fairly complex combat system, is all canned button combos and scripted animations.  The upcoming Blade of Darkness looks very much like Die by the Sword with an updated engine; it uses a complex physics engine, but it's streamlined combat interface is obviously aimed at a lower common denominator.  No one, not even Die by the Sword's creators at Treyarch, has been brave enough to try another interface this bold.  Treyarch made a Dreamcast game called Draconus that obviously draws from their work on Die by the Sword and even uses the VSIM engine.  Although I haven't actually played it, it seems that VSIM is only used for the character animation; the actual swordplay is simply a matter of hitting an attack or block button.-- Tom ChickWant to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.PresentationThe Quest mode hasn't held up well, but the arenas are a good showcase for the combat system.6.0GraphicsHorrible textures and blocky models from the earlier days of polygonal engines.2.0SoundFunny sound bites, good monster sounds, and great weapon thumps and clanks.8.0GameplayA unique control system makes this game unlike any before or since.8.0Lasting AppealThe arenas have some staying power, but without internet multiplayer support, you need a LAN to really extend its life.6.0Should I Go Back and Play It?It's not as flashy as console style fighting games, but it's ultimately more gratifying.YesOVERALL SCORE(not an average)8.0Die by the Sword was a game before its time.  Two years after its release, it may still be before its time.  There's been nothing else like it and there's nothing like it in the foreseeable future.  But if you can find a copy in a bargain bin, take it home and get ready to find out how deep you can really sink into a fighting game.", "date": "Jan 16, 2001"}
