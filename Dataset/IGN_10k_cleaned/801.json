The company manages to kick out a game every couple of months that consistently hits the high-quality mark, without it ever seeming like they actually are kicking them out. With the company's latest strategy RPG, they yet again show that equally blended strategy and role-playing elements can pay off. Front Mission 3 contains the same amazing attraction that kept gamers glued to their TV's with Final Fantasy Tactics. Sure, the story may be a little too politically driven for the casual RPG gamer, but when you factor in Japan's greatest gift to the world, you can just focus on the on-screen action.   That's right, I'm talking about mechas. Big, lumbering, loaded to the gills with all kinds of weapons, badass, 100-ton machines of justice abound here, and I couldn't be happier. Front Mission 3 is a mech fanboy's wet dream. It's chock full of mech-on-mech action (get your mind out of the gutter  pervert), combined with Square's great eye for pacing and story, and topped off with a thick icing of sweet, sweet graphic goodness. Trust me, if you can't find something to like about this game, you're nuts.   Gameplay So what's the hook? There's always a hook with Square games. Whether it is the amazing CG, thrilling story, or tight control, something will grab you. Well, Front Mission 3's hook is the gameplay, or rather the insane amount of it. Square promises over 150 hours of gameplay, and it's all amazingly packed into 1 CD. Now before you start freaking out, let me explain. Early on in the game (very early in fact, shortly after a great tutorial), you're given a choice: do you do with a friend or not? The decision you make will spiral you down into one of two stories, and while the two parts do cross throughout the game, the real meat of the story will take place in each of the two scenarios, and to get the big picture, you'll have to play both parts.   First and foremost, Front Mission 3 is all about strategy. You're constantly weighing your options in the hopes of striking some sort of balance between available resources, your mechs' (called Wanzers) strengths and weaknesses, and the enemy's strengths and weaknesses. While it may seem this constant monitoring of what's on hand would be tedious, it's actually quite intuitive, and fits in perfectly with the robot-oriented world. Each of the Wanzers body parts (arms, legs, and torso) has a separate amount of HP, and can be upgraded with more, as well as enhanced with all the usual powerups (defense, strength, speed, etc.). There's literally an upgrade or option for even the most anal and detail-crazed gamer out there. In fact, FM3 offers a whole virtual Internet that could have been a game in and of itself. There's a whole other set of unlockable wallpapers (for your virtual desktop, of course), vehicles, side stories, even the most powerful Wanzer in the game is buried somewhere in the game's Internet. Hell, you can even bookmark certain ~pages~ and the whole thing is done in a sort of 3D/2D hybrid interface. Sound cool? It is.   As I said before, however, the game might not work for everyone. The game's story and settings center around a technical high school student named Kazuki Takemura and his role in the political relationships between the United States of New America (USN) and the Japanese Defense Force (JDF), as well as the neo-Japanese cities that they take place in. Because of this, there is a lot of Japanese text and topics that may turn off more of the casual gamer. There is, of course, the classic Square narrative, and the story of a young man that's in the wrong place at the right time. Without giving away too much, lets just say the side that Kazuki thought was the good guys takes a turn for the shady when he discovers that tests are being done  dangerous ones  without real concern for the people involved. This quickly spirals down into a tale of black ops projects and the mysterious people behind them. It's tough to describe it without really giving away the storyline. As I said earlier, though, depending on which choice you make early in the game, the story skews off into one of two sub-stories, one dealing with Kazuki's adopted sister Alisa, the other with a mysterious USN officer named Emma.   Story aside, if you play Front Mission 3 for any extended period of time, you'll soon discover one of the greatest turn-based combat systems in games today. Not because of the actual combat itself necessarily (which is as fantastic to watch as it is to execute), but because of the ease in which it's pulled off. Weapon switches, targeting, movement, attacks, counter attacks and more. They're all executed seamlessly through the interface, and in an intuitive way that I haven't seen done since Final Fantasy tactics. Other developers take note this is how you organize an incredibly deep system into an easy-to-use interface. Like so many games of it's ilk, FM3 is easy to pick up, but quickly opens itself up to reveal a much deeper core than first seen.   Graphics This is just classic Square goodness. After sitting through grainy, convoluted texture Hell, it's really nice to actually see a game where the texture are detailed, yet still come out remarkably smooth. They're remarkably varied, especially considering the light loading times for the battle sequences. Everything from caves to freeways are expertly constructed, and allow you to do what you've always wanted to do with huge, hulking machines: blow $#!^ up. In almost all the environments, you can target and blow something up. Sometimes, it's just a car that you felt need a good 300 rounds of lead pumped into (who knows, maybe the paint job was crappy), and others, it may be strategic.   All of the Wanzers, including enemies have separate parts with separate HP levels, bring an enemy's right arm HP to 0, and you'll see it blow or fall off, revealing sparking and smoldering wires dangling from where the appendage used rest. It's a great effect, and goes a long way towards making these machines look more like extensions of human pilots than slow, clumsy robots.   The combat itself is as beautiful to execute as it is to watch. A tight, compact menu allows you to move, size up your opponent, read his chances of counterattacking, and then attack, all within the space of 2 or 3 button presses. Once you've actually made your choice, the animations that complete it are stunning. Pick one of the Melee weapons (like your Wanzer's fist), choose your opponent, and then watch the action transition smoothly from an overhead view, to one of a couple of more cinematic views. Your Wanzer will pull back its arm, and then blast the fist at your enemy. If the target is at all damaged, chances are you'll finish him off with the move, rewarding you with a smoldering pile of metal where once a proud Wanzer stood.   The other animations are just as slick. Fire off a shotgun or machine gun blast, and before you actually fire off the shots, your mech will literally plant its feet to steady itself for the kick and then fire off the blast or volley. Shoulder-mounted rockets will launch, with the camera tracking them until they reach their intended target, and flamethrowers will lambaste their target with a steady stream of fire. Even the animations that take place when you've finally finished off your opponent vary from time to time; pop an enemy Wanzer at close range with your shotgun, and it may blow off his arms and drop the body HP to 0, in which case, the mech will stumble around for a second, then slowly tip over sideways and shower sparks everywhere. Or, it may drop to its knees and then fall sideways, or it may simply shut down, drooping its shoulders and hunching over.   The graphics aren't flawless, however. The framerate when switching from overhead to full 3D view is spottyFront Mission 3 is yet another winner from Square's stable. The PlayStation is showing it's age, and the mission structures for some of the in-game action can tend to repeat itself, but you really can't beat the very Final Fantasy Tactics-ish addictiveness that it offers. A tight, narrative blend of music, effects, and those great Square graphics (even if they aren't as flashy as the Final Fantasy series) await the gamer that can handle a slightly boring story and slower pacing than most games. If you liked Final Fantasy Tactics, and mechs, then this is the perfect marriage.It's a solid, well done game, but doesn't really stand out in any way either. It may be the PlayStation gray hairs showing, but Front Mission 3 doesn't really seem like much more than a good strategy game in the PlayStation's final days.", "date": "Mar 22, 2000"}
