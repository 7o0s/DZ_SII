The game was definitely Codemasters' trademark title, as it has spun off into many sequels including a 3D one on the PlayStation and N64. The original games have not been forgotten, as THQ and On-Line have brought the original two games back for a full-color, portable romp across the Game Boy Color, and it's just as good as it was back in the NES days. Features  60 different tracks. More than 15 vehicles. Special hidden tracks and vehicles. Two-player mode. Only for Game Boy Color  Micro Machines 1 and 2 Twin Turbo really is two racing games in one  the original title, and the sequel. When you play the two games, you'll see how ever so slightly different they really are.  The original game is a 24-track circuit, featuring jeeps on a breakfast table, sports cars on a snooker table (this is UK-designed, after all), tanks on the playroom floor, helicopters in the backyard, and more. The sequel is another 24-track circuit with ATVs  in the garden, dump trucks on the dining room table, pick-up trucks on a music table, and more. In both games, the task is to come in first or second in a four-man race to qualify to the next course. If you come in third or fourth, you lose a life and must re-complete the last course to continue. Lose all three lives and you're out for the game. Luckily, if you come in first you'll earn the opportunity to win an extra continue by beating the clock in a single-vehicle race.   Races are completely fast and brutal for these mini vehicles  each vehicle has its own handling and speed, as well as unique course layout and hazards. For example, jump into a speedboat and you'll be in the bathtub with the thick soapsuds lining the track  you'll have to not only watch out for the huge rubber ducks blocking the way, but also the whirlpooling drain that'll suck you down if you get too close. Race on the breakfast table, and you'll have to avoid spots of slippery milk or sticky syrup, all while following the track laid-out by specks of Cheerios. You can easily fall off course, and the penalty here is the delay in waiting for the computer placing you back on the course, as well as the distance lost in the meantime.  Two players can also join in on the same system. With one player on the D-pad and the other on the buttons, each person simply turns their vehicle left and right (gas is automatic) trying to force each other off the edge of the screen. The person who earns the most points (best of eight) on the course wins. It's a unique idea that's been with the series since the beginning, and while the ~sharing system~ controls are a little awkward, this mode is still a whole lot of fun.  The differences between the two games are both in look and difficulty. The original Micro Machines offers smaller vehicles, which gives you more time to react to the obstacles that approach ahead. It also features a nice multi-scrolling 2D engine to simulate depth when you're up on a table  the illusion is excellent, even to this day. The game doesn't move as quickly as it did on the NES, and it's a little easier to fool the computer AI.  I finished the entire circuit in an hour and a half, something I wasn't able to do on the NES version of the game. There's also an annoying collision detection quirk on this edition, causing your car to stick to objects you should normally bounce off of.   On the sequel, the camera is a little closer, which makes it a lot harder to react to the oncoming obstacles and turns. It lacks the multi-plane scrolling from the original title, but the game moves a lot faster than Micro Machines 1 does, making the game a lot more challenging.  There are two big complaints about this compilation  one, there's no battery save. For a game that remembers the best laptime for each track, and for one that spans 24 tracks in a sitting, this omission is a no-no. Even when the game was released on the NES, I could only play up to a certain point before pausing the game to take a break and leaving the system on  the game wouldn't save your position nor would it offer a password to let you jump to the higher tracks. Two, there's no link cable mode. Sure, you can play two players on the same system, but it just makes sense to spend the extra development time to utilize the feature that's made for the Game Boy system  game link. I'm super happy Micro Machines is finally available on the Game Boy Color  I've had the original Micro Machines in my collection for the black-and-white Game Boy, and while the design was good, the game was nearly unplayable because of the blurring LCD screen of the Game Boy Pocket. Micro Machines 1 and 2 looks absolutely fantastic on the Game Boy Color, and feels just as tight as it did way back when. I'm just bummed about the lack of link cable and battery save. Other than that, great stuff all around.", "date": "Jan 28, 2000"}
