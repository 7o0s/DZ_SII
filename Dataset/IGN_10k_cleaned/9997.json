I'm happy to report, though, that The Spiderwick Chronicles is a pleasant surprise.  It's an adventure title that immerses the player in a lighthearted, fantasy world filled with an impressive amount of mythical creatures.  It's not perfect, and its definitely aimed at a younger audience, but adolescent adventurers will likely be engrossed with Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You.   The Chronicles were originally a best-selling children's book series that is now being released as a feature film next week.  Of course, with children's movies come videogame tie-ins.  Luckily, this adaptation avoids many of the lazy, phoned-in trappings that so many licensed games fall victim to.  The titular Chronicles are an encyclopedia of the fantasy world that exists all around us.  Arthur Spiderwick discovered this hidden dimension many years ago and kept a journal of his discoveries.  Players take control of three siblings when they discover the field guide after moving into Spiderwick's old mansion.   The game can be controlled mostly with the stylus, much like Phantom Hourglass.  Tap where you want to walk and interact with the world around you by rubbing and scratching objects.  I prefer to control my movement with the D-pad and just use the stylus for investigating and making selections.  There are tons and tons of items to find, Sprites to catch, and curious areas to check.  The game does a good job of engaging the player, keeping them from getting bored, and enticing them with what might be waiting around the next corner.   Combat is turn-based and plays out much like battle in the Mario RPGs.  Enemies are visible while exploring the map, and when you encounter a goblin or a mole troll the game will switch to a side view of the action.  Each attack and defend comes with a timed mini-game that will add a bonus.  Perhaps you'll have to quickly trace a pattern with the stylus for an attack boost or tap your character right as they are being assaulted to minimize the blow.  The typical RPG array of physical and magical attacks are at your disposal.  There is also an interesting take on the decision to place the siblings on the front lines or in the back.  While in the back they can only use ranged weapons, but if they're accosted back there the rest of the family will automatically perform a counter-attack.   If only we could find an Improve Graphics Sprite. Your magical abilities come from finding Sprites, of which there are dozens of different kinds.  Some will assist you while exploring the world around your mansion, and some can be used in combat.  In Pokemon fashion, the only way to complete your Sprite collection is by trading with friends who also own The Spiderwick Chronicles.  There are five Unique Sprites -- three of them are on your cartridge.  You'll have to hit up a friend for the remaining two.   Certain Sprites allow you to level up.  Each character has basic stats for health, strength, and magical ability.  Every time you find a Level-Up Sprite you can distribute it as you see fit.  The siblings all have their own strengths, so you can either boost the area they are already proficient in and make them an unstoppable murder machine or try to compensate for their handicaps.   Visually, The Spiderwick Chronicles is pretty bland.  The books are well-illustrated, so it's a shame the game looks so generic.  There isn't enough variety in the environments, either, so it's easy to feel like you're going in circles while exploring.  The music goes a long way towards making up for the blah visuals, though.  You'll probably want to turn the volume up for this one, as it suitably captures the mood of a world where nothing is quite what it seems.  You know how children's music can sound pretty creepy played from a music box?  That's a good way to describe Spiderwick's soundtrack.   Frustration sets in occasionally when you are defeated in battle and the game sends you back to the last checkpoint which might have been 10/15/20 minutes ago.  Some modern RPGs have gotten around this annoyance by letting the player keep the experience points they earned even if they lose, or they'll allow us to save at any point.  Spiderwick is not so lenient.  It's nice to find some challenge in a children's game, but developers should be aiming for that sweet spot between irritation and boredom.Playing The Spiderwick Chronicles took me back to old-school adventure games like Alice in Wonderland on the Apple II.  It recreates that feeling of being a kid and suspending your disbelief in fantasy.  Much of this success in setting a mood and creating an intriguing world to explore is attributable to Holly Black's original books.  But I have to give credit to developer Stormfront for creating a fun game to go inside the Spiderwick license.  The graphics aren't much to look at, the environments need more variety, and checkpoints don't come along often enough.  But there is a big area to delve into, the music is great, and there are lots of options in combat.  There's something new to find around every corner, and that's something I can't say about enough games.", "date": "Feb 8, 2008"}
