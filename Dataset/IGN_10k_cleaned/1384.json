So you know it was a good one.  In fact, in terms of the amount of hours I spent on it, I probably played more of DOA than any other game back in the day, counting stuff I played strictly for the fun of it.  The survival mode was one of those things you could play for hours, just halfway conscious of what you were doing - in fact, I seemed to play better when I was half asleep.  The most interesting DOA experience, though, was when I experimented with different sorts of music, trying to see whether a certain rhythm meant a better survival record.  I discarded my thesis when I set my still-standing record while on the phone with my mother.  I still haven't quite figured out what was going on there...  Years later, we have what will probably be the last DOA for some time.  Now that the Japanese Dreamcast version has beaten it to market, making this PS2 update the fifth version of the game, I'd estimate that DOA2: Hardcore on the PlayStation 2 is the series' sendoff for a while, unless Team Ninja decides they need to make just one more fighting game before biting the bullet and doing something with the long-rumored ~Kunai~ project.  So I think it's safe to say that we've already answered the question of whether DOA2 is a good game.  It certainly is, an equal member of the next-generation 3D fighting triumvirate with Tekken Tag and Soul Calibur.  The question as far as Hardcore specifically is concerned, though, is whether it's worth picking up with a cheaper Dreamcast analog on the market, and that one, I think, will have to be answered by your individual circumstances.    Gameplay DOA2: Hardcore.  I'll deal with those one at a time.  Dead or Alive 2 you're probably familiar with, from the Dreamcast version, which (like its predecessor) most closely resembles Virtua Fighter if you're looking for an analog.  There are three buttons, like Virtua Fighter, although blocking is handled like Tekken or Street Fighter, and the block button is replaced by the multipurpose ~free~ button.  DOA2 moves the series further in its own direction, though, drawing some influence from Soul Calibur and naturally developing the  reversal system that's all its own.  That's the central element of DOA's fighting system.  While strikes, throws, and offensive holds will probably occupy the balance of your time, what can really swing the balance of the game (and what is the mark of an experienced player) is the ability to catch and reverse your opponents' attacks with a directional motion and the ~free~ button.    The PS2 version sets things up with movement on the D-pad, a shortcut to free movement on the left analog stick, and all four face buttons used - one of them is a combination of free and punch, the basic throw input.  It doesn't really possess much advantage over the Dreamcast control scheme, although it's perhaps a little easier to reach the PS analog stick, and the stiffer D-pad on the Dual Shock is more responsive to double-tap motions.  So what does the ~Hardcore~ amount to?  Well, let me gather my thoughts for a second, since I have to compare four different versions of the game to each other.  Okay, let's see...DOA2: Hardcore on PS2 is the most complete version of DOA2 available, possessing more features than either of the original versions or the Japanese Dreamcast release.  It shares its new costumes with that last version there, but unlike either Dreamcast version, it includes three new tag battle arenas, all of them a sight more attractive than the drab Danger Zone arena where all the tag action in the Naomi and DC versions takes place.  In the omake department, it has a pair of gallery modes, where you can check out movies and still art of the various DOA2 characters (read: fine CG chicks in bikinis), and both Bayman and Tengu are eventually playable, although neither is that impressive an addition.  Leon was more than half a carbon copy of Bayman to begin with, and Tengu achieves the improbable feat of being even cheaper and uglier than Shin Ogre.     As far as actual gameplay is concerned, there are also several new moves for different characters, although their significance is generally minor or entirely cosmetic.  It's cool to check out all the new double-team moves in the tag mode, in other words, but what the move looks like doesn't have any bearing on whether or not it'll win the fight for you.  Every so often, though, you'll run into a new move that actually does something worthwhile, and it'll turn your head for a moment.  That feeling actually pops up in a number of different situations with Dead or Alive 2.  It's actually a very subtle game in many ways.  Yes, I know the joke you're about to make, but sit down with it a while, paying close attention, and you'll notice a lot of unusual details thrown into its visuals and fighting system that may only pop up on rare occasions, but add some very interesting shadings to an extended experience with the game.  Slipping on ice in the arctic levels.  Kicking up water droplets in puddles here and there.  The occasional pressures applied by the oddly-shaped levels, which affect both your movement and certain special throw moves.  And of course, there's the thundering exclamation point of crashing through the multilayered arenas, falling over edges, bouncing off the walls, or breaking through them altogether into entirely new areas.  What I wonder about, though, is when 3D fighting will actually pull up its stakes and go somewhere entirely new.  Arguably, the last significant evolution in the genre was Virtua Fighter 3, or even just plain old Virtua Fighter if you're feeling particularly conservative.  Soul Calibur, Tekken Tag Tournament, and DOA2 alike aren't any of them the biggest of leaps beyond VF3 in terms of visuals or depth of gameplay.  The continuous refinement of that model has taken 3D fighting to the same place where Street Fighter 3 took 2D fighting, more or less, a weird sort of limbo where the games are so deep and complex that there are only two classes of player.  Experts are experts, scrubs are scrubs, and never the twain shall meet.  Hauling myself out of this tangential pit and back to DOA2, its place in the current scheme of 3D fighters is, to me, a more balanced and better-curved alternative to Tekken Tag Tournament.  Now, please don't get me wrong, Tekken is an amazing game.  I've seen it in the hands of the very best players in the world, and at that level, it is absolute poetry in motion.      But therein lies some of my problems with the game as well, because Tekken is not all that friendly to the new player.  Or, to put a finer point on it, it's exceedingly cruel to the new player, and either turns him into a filthy hateful button-masher or sends him into fits of poring over FAQs and move-lists for hours, eventually emerging as something not quite human and no fun to play against.  Dead or Alive 2, on the other hand, is a little friendlier.  Yes, it's a masher's game at very low levels of play, but between two intermediate players who've both gotten the hang of the reversal system, it's more than fair, and it has a pleasant degree of complexity in its fast, medium-sized-combo-focused way.  Its level design, meanwhile, is a giant leap beyond anything a serious fighting game has ever done.  Graphics And hey, it doesn't hurt that it looks absolutely gorgeous.  DOA2: Hardcore is hands-down the best-looking port of anything on PlayStation 2, which seems to be establishing itself as the system that's a pain in the neck to port stuff to.  It's easily a visual match for the Dreamcast version, and every so often I think I can spot just a little more depth to its color and effects.  The character models are tall, smooth, richly animated, and every one of their many ridiculous outfits is covered with excellent texture detail in DOA's traditionally smoother, more animation-inspired style (as compared to Tekken's emphasis on more rough, realistic detail).     The animation and collision detection are especially impressive when you see how many different holds and grapples there are in DOA2.  Attacks flow into reversals with remarkable fluidity - the transition between the two happens without a hitch, whereas there was always a bit of a hiccup in the animation when you reversed somebody in the first DOA.  Complex wrestling moves like Tina's Japanese Ocean Suplex and figure-four leglock come off with very few clipping errors between the characters, which is very surprising considering how fast the animations execute and how complex the interactions are.  The levels in DOA2, meanwhile, are masterpieces of visual as well as structural design.  They look so good, it's almost a shame to run around smashing all the walls.  This goes double for some of the additions to Hardcore, which equal almost anything on the market in terms of visual opulence.  A new level set on a rooftop in Hong Kong brings to mind Shen Mue's detailed cities - buildings tower on either side with all kinds of signs and banners hanging from them, and a beautiful sunset shines down over everything.  Fall over the edge and you're in one of the alleys from Tekken Tag, surrounded by neon lights that reflect in the puddles on the ground.  The new tag arenas vary in terms of complexity, but they're all very clean visual creations, and each has some original effects to make it unique.  The UFC-style octagon stage doesn't overawe with its detail or design, but it's a nice addition nonetheless, and there's a cool marquee that shows the names of the fighters in the ring.  Another new tag stage (called ~The Pancratium~, I believe), is much more impressive, showing a massive castle towering in the stormy background, and it his some gorgeous purple lightning effects when you bounce an opponent off the walls.  The most unusual of the lot takes place in some sort of abandoned mutant construction site, with ground that gently slopes toward a brown pool in the center - the water has the same effect as the streams in the temple stage.    The new tag stages are a very welcome addition.  While the tag mode is still basically a party-game sort of feature - it's too cheap and juggly for serious competition - it's a great graphical showcase, and that quality was brought down in the Dreamcast version by the fact that you had to fight in the most boring level in the game.  Having some more scenery to look at does a lot for the mode's replayability.  To address some of Hardcore's other new features, though, the new costumes are mostly a disappointment.  There aren't a great number of new ones (no more than two or three for each character), and most of them I could have frankly done without.  Tina's P4 I don't ever want to see again, and the same goes for Lei-Fang and Ayane's new outfits.  Sadly, there still aren't any outfits in DOA2 that I like as much as Kasumi's P9 from the first game.  Even more important, where the hell are the damn bunny suits?  Sound If you've heard DOA2, you've heard Hardcore, although I believe this version includes some previously unheard tracks from Bomb Factory, whoever that happens to be.  Yes, it's generic modern hard rock, but it's a nice change from the generic game music that comprises most of the tracks, and the mutant Engrish lyrics lend a cheerfully bizarre quality to the music.  The effects, meanwhile, get the job done - the sound of crashing walls and exploding energy bolts is a special highlight, but all of the sound bites accent attacks and events well.     Time for Tecmo USA to take some lumps, though - for reasons undecipherable by right-thinking humans, they've dubbed the game, and badly.  The voice actors themselves aren't all that bad, but unfortunately, they're speaking lines from the goofball text translation that you may recall from the Dreamcast version.  So the actress playing Kasumi, for example, actually says ~How dare you, swindler!~ in her first cinema sequence.  No, I'm not joking.  You can, however, switch back to the Japanese voices in the options menu.I am not, I can say for sure, ready to recommend Hardcore to those who already own the American Dreamcast version.  It's got some nice additions, but the core of the game is the same - the additions to the experience aren't worth fifty dollars and another console.  Very few of the new costumes are really welcome additions, and the new moves and tag arenas, while cool, are still icing, not cake.For prospective first-time DOA2 purchasers, the question is a little bit more complicated.  Or maybe it's not, after all, since at this point you're either assured of getting a PlayStation 2 or incapable of buying one for several months.  If you've got a PlayStation 2, by all means choose Hardcore - after all, it has the most complete feature set of any DOA2, and arguably the best graphics (although that's such a wriggly little can of worms that I feel no desire to open it up at this point).But this is not a game to buy a system for, when a version that's almost as good just happens to be available on a console that's half the price.And while I'm picking fights, this is also the game I'd personally choose over Tekken Tag Tournament.  Stone me for heresy if you like (excuse me while I duck and cover), but I'll always prefer DOA's speed, balance, character design, and levels, even if Tekken may be the majority choice.  I'm not saying this is a ~better~ game, because I see no reason to argue such fine points as arise when discussing this level of fighting game, but it's the one I enjoy more, and this version I enjoy the most of any I have available to me.  If you're lucky enough to have a similar freedom of choice, DOA2: Hardcore is the game to get.", "date": "Oct 24, 2000"}
