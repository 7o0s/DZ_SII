{"name": "Kyojin no Doshin 1", "name_review": "Kyojin no Doshin 1 (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/18/kyojin-no-doshin-1-import", "text": "~Populous meets Mario.~ That's at least how Kyojin no Doshin's lead designer Kazutoshi Iida describes his latest creation. And he's right, to a certain extent. Doshin is a whole lot like the classic Populous. Although the game isn't played from an outside first-person perspective like Molyneux's title, Doshin is all about playing God. Players star in the role of a yellow giant who, like the sun, ascends every morning from the sea to visit the peaceful inhabitants of a chain of tropical islands -- and much like the sun, the giant can bring both life and death.   Your basic actions are walking, picking up objects or people, raising the terrain by pulling it up or lowering it by jumping on it. Later on, you will also figure out how to raise and lower terrain on the fly while walking around. As you explore your surroundings, you encounter different tribes of island natives that go about their daily lives. When they see your giant for the first time, they are most likely going to be scared. But you can eventually win their trust by bringing them trees which are needed to keep the natural balance of the land intact. If you plant a tree in a barren, brown area of an island, the ground will instantly turn green which enables the inhabitants to build buildings or fields. Once you gain the trust of a tribe, they will ask you for additional favors, such as changing the terrain for them or helping them against natural disasters like tornadoes or volcanic eruptions. The ultimate goal of the game is to help the different tribes flourish and get them to construct temples and henges to honor your giant. Each time a tribe builds such a structure, it is added to your monument journal.  Whenever you do something nice, the islanders will repay you with hearts (love) which frame your screen similar to the fruit in Yoshi's Story. Every time this gauge is full, your giant will grow bigger. On the other hand, every time you do something bad, the gauge will be filled with skull marks (hate) that cover the hearts. If the gauge is filled with skulls, your giant shrinks. So why would you want to do something bad? Well, the bigger you grow the more problems you are likely to cause. A big giant obscures much of the player's vision, so it's much easier to accidentally step on an islander or a building. On the other hand, a small giant is terribly slow and it will take you forever to get from one corner of the map to the other. The basic idea is that there needs to be a balance between everything, whether it's good and evil, creation and destruction, or love and hate. To drive the point home, players can change their benevolent yellow giant into an evil red one at the touch of a button. The red giant doesn't give life, it can only destroy. When your islanders see the red giant, you will instantly receive a load of skulls.     At the end of the day, your giant will be tired and disappear into the ocean. You will then be able to access all kinds of stats about your giant and your virtual world and hear comments from inhabitants on what they think of their unlikely god. If you think this all sounds weird, wait till you hear what this game actually sounds like. I can't really explain it, but take it from me when I tell you that it is likely to drive anyone who's sitting next to you while you're playing completely nuts. Think lots of different squeaky sounds and exotic beats mixed with high pitched squeals... The whole game is narrated by a slow-talking island native who explains all the goings-on to your islands, but once in awhile, an unknown woman cuts in to say ~watch out, you're going to fall! Oops. There you have it. You fell.~ Just in case you're confused, the woman narrator's presence is even addressed in the manual: ~Why, don't you like hearing a woman's voice once in awhile?~ This pretty much sums up the tone of the whole game. It's wacky, weird and doesn't take itself very seriously  but there is still a strong design philosophy at the heart of it all.   Graphically, Kyojin no Doshin is a mess. Framerates are slow, there is plenty of pop-up and draw-in, character animation (especially for the islanders) is a joke and the overall look is bland. To make things worse, the rudimentary camera control makes it hard to see where you're going or to watch what the natives are up to. Speaking of control, the whole game is so slow paced and the control so loose, impatient gamers will throw down the controller after minutes of gameplay. Oddly enough, I kept on playing and found myself hooked by the simple game mechanics. Creating new islands and watching new civilizations sprout up eventually gets so addictive, it makes you overlook many of the game's control problems and graphical glitches. Ironically, the game doesn't really need a human player to function, anyway. Thanks to the 64DD's built-in clock, Kyojin no Doshin takes on a life of its own after your first game. The tribes and flora of your world evolve in between gameplay sessions, presenting new problems and changes every time you play. So, is it ~Populous Meets Mario~ after all? No. Sorry. Populous started a new genre by letting gamers play God, Mario entertained millions by delivering flawless controls and clever puzzles. Like Iida's previous efforts Tail of the Sun and Aquanaut's Holiday, Kyojin no Doshin is a badly executed game with some great ideas. It speaks for Iida's qualities as a designer that despite the mediocre presentation and slow pace, Kyojin manages to entertain players for many hours on end. But considering that you need to shell out some serious cash to get your hands on a DD and the game, the frustrating controls and bad graphics simply can't be overlooked. For that amount of money, I suggest you buy yourself a copy of Super Mario 64 and a SNES with Populous and Mario World instead.", "date": "Jul 18, 2000"}
