But with perseverance, the firm has indeed managed to stuff and squeeze more than just the essence of the Sid Meier classic into a single handset download, they have actually managed to leave little out. This is effectively the PC game with trimmed back graphics and some minor gameplay modifications, and that's a major achievement.   For a fan of the series, I think seeing Civ III in my hand is absolutely incredible. The game is rich, deep, and engrossing -- you guide no less than one of a few burgeoning societies, such as Americans and Egyptians, from the Stone Age to the present day. The scale of gameplay is enormous, as each move has you balancing city development, technology advancements, physical movement, and engagement of other civilizations.   The PC game can be quite overwhelming to a beginner, and that game comes with full documentation and a large-screen display -- so you can imagine what difficulties are in store for the uninitiated that have their first Civ experience on mobile. The documentation (in-game, of course) is lacking for Civ III, and if you just try to jump right in, you're in for a bit of confusion and inevitable defeat. You need to actually know what commands do what actions, how technology trees intertwine, and a solid overview of how Civ III works. Mercifully, Com2us has provided some great instructions and charts at this dedicated Civ III site.   Needing to go off-handset to know how to play a mobile game isn't very user-friendly by definition, though. And Civ III is likely too dense for most casual mobile gamers. That's not a slight on anybody's intelligence -- it's just that the depth on Civ III is practically unparalleled in mobile gaming right now. Com2us should be commended for bringing such a complete vision to mobile, but it begs the accessibility question -- how many people are looking for an experience this involved on their handsets?   If you're unfamiliar with the game, Civ III's basic game flow goes kinda like this: You start out a stranger in strange land, a settler ready to lay down stakes for a home city. Once you build your first city, you must train up units to continue exploration and defend your city. More settlers will expand your empire with additional cities. You connect these cities with roads for easier transfer of troops and resources. Resources are exploited with mines and whatnot. And cities are improved with a series of buildings -- some are functional (like aqueducts and granaries), some are cultural (wonders like the Pyramids, Colossus, or Great Library).   When you settle cities, you want to make sure you maximize the surrounding resources. Look for waterways that increase quality of life, as well as resource-generating squares, like gold deposits and gem pools that improve commerce. When you have an active economy, you are in a good position to start expanding your empire either through settling more cities or going to war. When launching attacks with your soldiers -- which cost money to produce -- you need to line up attack and defensive stats, and also take terrain into consideration. It gets complicated quite quickly.   You will not be very good at Civ III at first. In fact, unless you have extensive experience, your first game will end in great failure. Your buildings will be sold off due to lack of maintenance funds. Your armies will be slaughtered. Your civilization will fall beneath the might of AI-controlled empires that have no mercy during your ~baby steps~ phase. But, trust me and hang in there -- there is some serious pay-off if you get good at the game. When you create a massive empire full of happy citizens, full of wonders that inspire and troops that strike fear beyond your borders, there is a real feeling of accomplishment.   As mentioned, Com2us did make some slight changes for the mobile user. There is an auto-save every ten minutes to support the manual save option -- in case of disaster, you won't lose much progress. Some of the political stuff has been stripped away. Air and sea units have also been taken out, too. Com2us cites screen size as the reason for removing those units, and while they will be missed by hardcore Civ fans, the choice is for the best.   I downloaded and played Civ III on a Sony Ericsson S710a. The game screen is clean and efficient, but it's definitely not going to win any awards for graphics. Com2us was obviously focusing on getting the necessary information and features on the screen and in the menus with as little confusion as possible.  Civilization III is a massive game that offers dozens of hours of game play, making it a tremendous value for mobile gamers. The learning curve, however, is so steep that I fear many gamers will fall away before they really get into the groove of the game. Do yourself a favor and look at all of Com2us' documentation before downloading to see exactly what you're getting into. Chances are, seeing some of the cool stuff you can do and build, such as the Hanging Gardens, will draw you in. There is a lot of game in here if you're willing to take the time to learn how to unlock it all, but I understand why the more casual-minded mobile gamers may be tempted to take a pass.", "date": "Jun 21, 2006"}
