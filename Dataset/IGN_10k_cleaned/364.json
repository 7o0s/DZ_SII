{"name": "Speed Devils", "name_review": "Speed Devils", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/02/speed-devils", "text": "There has yet to be a traditional racing game for the American Dreamcast - a pretty startling statement, considering the sheer number of titles that debuted with the system.  Let's see, Tokyo Xtreme Racer didn't really fall into the standard racing category, despite its being one of the best launch titles.  Flag to Flag, TNN, and Monaco were more simulations than anything, and managed to drive unexpecting players to frustration (see my TNN review for evidence of this).  Thankfully, things are about to change, as Ubi Soft's Speed Devils sees release.  Speed Devils, actually a port of a PC title called Speed Busters, offers a traditional arcade style racing experience, similar in some respects to Cruisn' World in that sacrifices some of the more unwelcomed aspects of realistic driving in order to provide for a fun, albeit flawed, gaming experience.  The first thing you'll notice when you play through the game (seeing as how it IS a racing game, afterall) are the various cars Ubi Soft has concocted.  These aren't real vehicles by any means, but seem to be based off the real thing.  You'll find cars pulled from the '60s, modern day vehicles with flames painted onto the side (does anyone still do this?), taxi cabs, and futuristic sports cars.  Each car is driven by a character of some sort, with such names as Pat Ohnine, Billy-Sue Bayou, Tex Dalton, and Jack E. Brown.  These characters, and the unique cars, add much personality to the game, as you don't just race against random vehicles, you race against Driver X and his futuristic speedster, or Jake Irvin and his taxi cab.  It's a nice touch.  The cars themselves are rated on acceleration, breaking, and speed, and all seem to handle differently.  You can choose from either manual or automatic transmission, and also have access to a hand break - useful when trying to take a tight corner at 100+ MPH.  As mentioned, the game's driving model is strictly arcadey, although Ubi Soft seems to have taken things a bit too far from reality.  The cars don't seem to make contact with the ground at times, as if you're on a hover-vehicle, and there seems to be a little something called momentum missing from the whole experience.  Compare this to other arcade-style racers like Sega Rally, and you may find yourself somewhat disappointed.  The problem is actually not all that big a deal, and I was able to accept and overlook it after a while, but a better driving model would have made the experience more enjoyable.  The game's tracks are, like the cars, full of personality.  You race across various tracks themed in locations from across the world.  Each track is full of detail, free of pop up and glitches, and has features you'd expect to find in the corresponding real world location.  Hollywood, for instance, has a giant T-Rex, a mammoth King Kong, and a Jaws lurking in the water in one area of the track.  Nevada is actually more of a trip through Las Vegas and its outskirts, as you'll find neon lights and various other pieces of casino imagery, as well as the reddy sands characteristic of the wasteland - err, the state.  These background elements actually work into gameplay.  The King Kong tries to smash you, for instance, and you'll have to travel through the T-Rex's legs, while the beast is moving, no less.  On top of this, the tracks actually change as you race from lap to lap, with landslides filling up areas of the road in some stages, and objects being positioned differently in other stages.  The actual track design is first class, but the designers went a little overboard in some respects.  The tracks have constant twists and turns, inclines, a few jumping points, as well as multiple paths and shortcuts.  The only problem is that the tracks are just too long.  Each lap can take between two and three minutes, which can be somewhat of a drag, as you're forced to race three laps.  I often found myself bored and growing impatient.  When you sit down with Speed Devils, expect to stay down for quite a while.  You can race through the tracks in one of three modes, arcade mode, versus mode, and championship mode.  In arcade mode, you go through a quick three lap race and select from a wide variety of cars.  The arcade mode is limited, unfortunately, by the aforementioned lack of free run or single lap options.  In versus mode, you go up against a friend for a split screen race; the split screen is handled well, with no apparent drop in detail and minimal drop in framerate.  There are actually different versions of the two player mode, including a Time Lag Mode, a Distance Lag Mode, and an Attack and Defend mode in which the defender tries to keep the attacker from getting in front of him.  The latter mode is somewhat like a simplified Tokyo Xtreme Racer, as the defender looses if the attacker manages to get in front for a certain amount of time (they even have the energy bar in there!).  The championship mode is the real area of interest in Speed Devils, though, and it does a good job of adding to the lastability of the one player gaming experience.  In this mode, you start off with a crappy wreck of a car and go through a series of races in your attempt to go from a Class D racer to a Class A racer capable of taking on the untouchable Driver X (I hear he's related to the long lost Genesis action hero Ranger X).  You race through multiple seasons consisting of races across various tracks, earning points depending on the results of the race.  Get enough points, and you'll advance to the next class.  To get the points, you'll have to be successful in the races, and the clunker you start out with ain't gonna cut it, for sure.  You'll have to upgrade your car engine, breaks, nitro capability (nitros are little turbo boosts you can give to your car with the press of a button), and various other areas using a simplified modification system.  Also requiring cash are the car repairs you'll have to make between races.  Speed Devils actually has visible car damage that affects gameplay, and if you want to keep your car up to speed, you'll have to cough up the bucks for a full or partial repair.  Cash required for these modifications and repairs can be earned by finishing races, staying ahead of the competition, getting the fastest lap, busting a copper's radar, and betting on the outcome of races.  Whoa there!  Those last two parts require some amount of explanation, eh?  I mean, busting a copper's radar in real life is one thing, but who ever expected to find something like that in a game?  And gambling?  Is that even legal the state of California (that's where I'm playing the game, afterall)?  Actually, these two features are unique to Speed Devils, and they're probably the title's two highpoints (aside from the interactive tracks and personality-filled cars).  Radar Busting takes place during a race.  You'll find coppers at various points on the track, and when you approach them, a number will flash on screen.  If you manage to keep your speed above this number for a few moments, you'll earn cash.  What makes this work so well is that it forces the daring player to maintain top speed during the more difficult parts of the courses.  Expect to find yourself crashing into walls and flying off the track in your attempt at busting the radar.  Gambling, on the other hand, is done before the races.  At seemingly random points, a thug will appear outside your garage and make a bet with you on the outcome of the following race.  The bet is actually more of a dare to test your confidence.  Do you think you can place first in the next race?  Care to put some money or your car down on the matter?  Win the bet, and you'll take the prize; lose (note: I wrote ~lose~, not ~loose~) the race, and the booty goes to the thug.  This is the quick route towards making cash and being able to purchase all the parts to your hearts content, as well as (do we dare even suggest this?) a new car.  The Championship Mode and two player mode will give you a good racing experience, despite the game's few flaws.  The things holding the title back from the greatness of a Sega Rally or Ridge Racer are the aforementioned long tracks, as well as overly unrealistic driving model.  Speed Devils should hold you over until Sega Rally 2 arrives this November, although I do wish Ubi Soft had released the game at the DC's launch (it's been done for a looooong time now), as the title would have had more of a gap.  Still, the game is enjoyable and pretty long lasting for a driving title, and kids will probably have an easy time of it, especially in comparison to the other DC racers.  For anyone else, if you aren't gasping for traditional arcade style racing from your Dreamcast, you may want to wait just a bit for Rally 2.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 2, 1999"}
