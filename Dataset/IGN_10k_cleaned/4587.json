{"name": "M.A.X. 2", "name_review": "M.A.X. 2", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/09/16/max-2", "text": "The original M.A.X. (Mechanized Assault and eXploration) was a strategy gamer's dream.  The developers at Interplay combined an innovative interface, stunning graphics, and unique gameplay to help to make M.A.X. one of the highest rated strategy games of last year.  Unfortunately, M.A.X. 2 shows very little of the originality of its predecessor and is frustrating to play at best.    M.A.X. 2 has the ambiance of a typical strategy war game.  We all know the story here: you mine resources, construct outposts, build military units, blow your opponents into little fleshy bits, and so on.  Like the original, M.A.X. 2 allows you to play in either a turn-based or real-time gaming environment.  Unfortunately, unlike the original, M.A.X. 2 just isn't that much fun.      Like too many other recent releases, M.A.X. 2 is not a finished product.  Although M.A.X. 2 has been on the shelves since mid-June, there has already been three patches released in three months with a fourth expected soon.  There are so many bugs, glitches, and shortcomings in this game they're almost too numerous to list, but you know I'm going to anyway.  First of all, units often disobey orders.  This is especially frustrating when you've ordered a retreat because you're getting the stew beat out of you and only half of your units respond.  There are also no training missions making the learning curve extremely steep, especially for those who haven't played the original.  Considering the complexity involved in M.A.X. 2, gamers who have never played a strategy game in their lives may very well run to the hills screaming if they try to jump into the genre with this one.  Unit groupings sometimes mysteriously vanish, so that battery of Missile Crawlers you had on 'Ctrl-1' simply may not respond if you're in a real bind.  To make matters worse, there are disappearing phantom units, specific units are often difficult to select with the pointer, and sometimes M.A.X. 2 doesn't seem to register mouse clicks at all.  All of this combined with a clunky, slow interface and numerous game crashes make for a tedious, unstable game which isn't worth its weight in dirt.  It would be nice to say that, although the gameplay suffers direly, the graphics in M.A.X. 2 make up for the tedium.  Too bad I can't.  The graphics are actually worse than the original M.A.X..  All of the landscapes are rather bland and the screenshots on the back of the box have obviously been retouched as the colors look brilliant compared to the actual game.  The individual units in M.A.X. 2 are tiny, even in full zoom, and they blend into the drab backgrounds making vehicles nearly indistinguishable from one another.  You can activate tags to display unit names, health, and allegiance, but doing so covers your units quickly making the screen cluttered and giving the feel of waging war with multicolored poker chips with strange names like 'MKI ASSA' and 'MKIV ROCK.'   There are some good things about M.A.X. 2.  The musical score was very dramatic and the voice characterizations were clear.  Nifty game features include the ability to assign multiple waypoints, spy cameras allowing for multiple on-the-fly vantage points, continuous building commands for construction units, the ability to assign orders to all of your units and buildings while paused, a scenario editor, and unit upgrades.  The AI is fairly decent, often flanking your forces instead of following a predictable path  la Red Alert.  The computer will also attack you with small, well-balanced armies generally providing good defensive and offensive power.  But as everyone knows, strategy games are best played against human opponents, not lifeless silicon boxes.  Unfortunately, M.A.X. 2 fails this as I couldn't complete even one multiplayer game without a crash.     All of the good features in M.A.X. 2 simply don't make up for the lack of solid gameplay and stability that gamers should expect from a final release.  This game could have been really good and it's obvious that the designers set out to make a unique strategy game, but corporate pressures probably forced them to get the product on the streets before it was ready.  The results remind me of a kiss from Grandma: the intentions are sweet, but it's sloppy and you just want to wipe it off after it's done.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Sep 16, 1998"}
