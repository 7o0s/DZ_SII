{"name": "X: Beyond the Frontier", "name_review": "X: Beyond the Frontier", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/07/x-beyond-the-frontier", "text": "When I was 14 years old (relax, it doesn't go on like this for long) I became hideously addicted to a Commodore 64 game called Elite. Despite the fact that the game boasted only the most basic wire-frame graphics, the title's fantastic mix of trading, combat and exploration made it a personal favorite. As the years went by, I kept hoping that someone would eventually release a title that brought the game's fantastic gameplay elements up to date. Sadly, despite several near misses (Mantis was too difficult to control, the Privateer series was too linear, and Gametek's Elite sequels made the unbelievably bad mistake of using real space physics) no one was ever to rekindle that same obsession in me that ancient title inspired  until now. While Egosoft's new X: Beyond the Frontier never aspires to the same heights that Elite did, it manages to come closer to the magic of that title that anything I've seen in the past twenty years. Sadly, in today's market of high concept visuals and movie quality effects, that may not be enough.   Let's start with the storyline. While the designers at Egosoft haven't exactly broken any new ground with the game's plotline, it serves its purpose without resorting to the inclusion of a massive novella to bring you up to speed on game events. As matter of fact, the game actually uses your complete ignorance of what's going on around you to add a sense of adventure and mystery to the tale. As the game begins, you are dropped into the shoes of a test pilot who's about to take off on what should be a short hop through space. As usually seems to happen with these things, something goes terribly wrong and you are instead thrown light-eons across the universe. As you come to in your damaged ship, you find yourself surrounded by fighter craft of unknown origin. Shortly after, the captain of the merchant ship that houses all of these menacing craft begins to communicate with you. After a couple of translation problems, you work out a deal. He will fix your craft and keep it from exploding and you can pay him back later. Not exactly finding yourself in a position of strength to bargain from, you agree and start out on your grand adventure.  The rest of the game is admirably simple. You spend your time travelling from base to base, each of which manufacture different goods, and trade with them in order to make money. The game features a dynamic economic engine that figures out such facts of trading life as supply and demand which keeps you from trading between the same two stations over and over again. Once you've built up enough credits to pay off your benefactors, you can start beefing up your ship with new technology that'll run across at space stations that deal in such niceties. Eventually you'll get bored with the safe life of a local and you'll head off into a stargate to find better trading routes and more information on how to return to your homeworld. This is where the game starts to pick up (god help you if you fly through the wrong stargate before you're really ready).   In addition to the profit-minded fellows who rescued your craft, this particular galaxy is filled with all sorts of other aliens who are trying hard to either get along with or kill each other. Your first real enemies will be pirates  unsavory nasties who fly around taking shots at helpless pilots in order to resell their cargo later. By buying a security agent license, you can actually earn quite a bit of cash flying around and blowing these guys up. Eventually you'll also run into a particularly nasty alien race who are sold on the idea of destroying all of the other local races. I'm not going to spoil the game by giving too much away here, but they're on average much better armed than you are and they're also pretty good pilots to boot (although they're also suicidal as hell, see my complaints below). Worse still, they stand between you and the ultimate prize of returning to your home planet, a fact that will put you in near constant conflict with them as the game wears on.  Visually, while X boasts some pretty spectacular background graphics and lens flare effects, it's really not very sophisticated compared to most of the games that are out there on the shelf. Even so, the game's art designers managed to do quite a lot with the game's somewhat feeble graphics engine. All of the bases and interiors in the game are very intelligently designed, if a touch on the simple side. Sound effects are excellent in the game, but the voice acting, while excellent in terms of delivery is often so unclear that you can't actually tell what's being said to you  a real drawback when you finally find yourself getting a game-dependant tidbit of information. Still, all of this is a bit unfair. Once you start getting into the game, X manages to produce quite a bit of atmosphere and charm in spite of its low polygon counts and hissing voice tracks.  X's gameplay is addictive, although I'd be hard pressed to tell you exactly why. Most of your early game will be spent flying around trying to find the best price on a substance, buying as much as you can afford and then selling it to the highest bidder. Even after you get new technology that allows you to compress the time you spend in between stations, this is actually pretty tedious, especially when you consider the fact that one mistrade can set you back hours. Later, when the game has picked up a bit, you'll still spend your time in space, but now you'll be trying to shoot down enemy craft. While this sounds pretty cool, the combat engine here is a great deal less complex than that of a Wing Commander or a Freespace and so combat ends up being more of a goal to be overcome than a challenge to be relished. Fortunately, the storyline keeps things moving along pretty rapidly and solid pilots who remember to save their games every so often won't find themselves too bogged down in the details of trading and shooting.  Most of X's problems aren't that serious, but the game does have a few problems that are really hard to overlook. First, as I mentioned above, the AI often tries to make up for its lack of fighting skill by simply running into you, instantly killing you both. While this certainly does make the game more challenging, it's also really irritating and doesn't make a whole lot of sense from a gameplay standpoint. Second off, the game's economics engine is ridiculously touchy and it can be pretty hard to turn enough of a profit to make flying around worth your while, especially in the beginning of the game. Finally, while the in-game storyline is an excellent tool for making the player feel like he's actually living out a story, it's also really annoying when you miss something as it goes by and never quite know what is going on with all those alien races. A multiplayer option would also have been really nice.  In the end, X: Beyond the Frontier is an admirable game that manages to do quite a lot with very little. Even so, it's doubtful that anyone besides those of you who are addicted (like me) to the trade simulator are going to find this title real competition for the big name space combat games that are already on the shelf. As for me, it looks like I'm going to have to wait another long year for Freelancer before I'm finally going to get my Elite fix fed...  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Mar 7, 2000"}
