They were about getting your initials (funny how many people's initials were ASS or POO) on that high-score table, instantly validating your hitherto worthless existence and enshrining your gaming skills for all the world (or at least the denizens of Famous Original Ray's Pizza Emporium) to see. While that mentality certainly hasn't disappeared  who doesn't, after all, like to see their score in Every Extend Extra Extreme or Geometry Wars sitting at the top of their friends list on XBLA?  it's certainly less prominent than it once was.   Enter The Club. While this game looks, handles and sounds a lot like a third person shooter, it actually has as much in common with those old high-score games as it does with the likes of Gears of War. This is a game about perfecting your runs through its levels  knowing where every enemy pops up, learning how to keep your combo going and rack up bonus points, maxing out your score. This is not a game that's about recreating a believable world and using realistic tactics  it's old school run and gun, and if you approach it with this in mind, it's also a whole lot of fun.   Fear the day the gimp gets loose.  The basic premise is that you're joining The Club, an elite underground bloodsport organisation run by a guy who does a pretty serviceable Dr Evil impersonation. (Sadly though, you can't win one million dollars). Simply choose from a line-up of prototypical hard men (from the highly decorated cop through to the Russian bear and extreme sports adrenaline junkie) and work your way through challenges in a host of environments, from a decrepit urban jungle to a decrepit manor house. 'Decrepit' is definitely an overriding thematic choice in this game.   The Club presents a number of different styles of challenge, all of which have one thing in common  it's all about the score at the end. So whether you're doing a Sprint, in which you must make your way through a linear level to the exit, a Time Attack, which sees you running laps through an environment, topping up on time by killing people and shooting and picking up icons, or you're playing Survivor, where you're assaulted from all sides in a limited space and must stay alive until the clock ticks down, it's really not about reaching the end, it's about perfecting the path to the end. Basically, the higher the multiplier you can rack up during your run (preferably taking it all the way through  bonus points are awarded the higher your multiplier at the end), the higher your score climbs (duh). Chaining together sequences of kills is the order of the day here. Each kill you get increases your multiplier by one and resets the 'killbar' timer. Fail to kill again before that ticks down and your multiplier number starts to 'bleed', rapidly dropping down until you lose it entirely or you nail another kill. It's a compelling system that gives the game a sense of urgency, and a pace that ramps up  the higher the multiplier, the less time you have to make your next kill.   Dr Evil's secret lair. Sharks with frickin' laser beams sold separately.  Obviously Bizarre Creations has designed its levels so that, in theory at least, you can chain together moves from start to finish. Cleverly, however, it's about more than just kills. Placed throughout levels are a number of skull signs which, when shot, also increase your multiplier and reset the killbar. A good player, then, doesn't just know where these signs are, but how best to utilise them. This is especially true in modes like Siege and Survivor, when they're basically all there for the taking from the start, but you have to decide whether to shoot them all at the beginning to quickly inflate your multiplier, to save them for lulls in combat during the round, or for an easy get-out-of-jail-free card when you're about to start bleeding multipliers.   There are numerous other ways for skilled players to boost their score too. Sequences of headshots, killing from a distance, commando-rolling into a kill, busting through a door into a kill, turning 180 degrees (courtesy of the quick-turn button) into a kill, shooting through objects, ricochet kills, multi-kills, even using the last bullet in a clip to make a kill. The Club is all about that stuff - not the things that define other modern shooters such as cover systems and intelligent AI.     It all adds up to a game that's equal part planning and equal part skill. It's one thing to know the order in which you need to take down enemies, but it's another to steadily knock off headshot after headshot, and time runs between enemies perfectly. It's also another to know when to detour for health and ammo pick-ups, when to switch weapons, when to throw grenades. Trust us  it's not hard to steadily increase your score with practice, but it's another to take your game to the top level.   And that's really the core nugget to take away from this review. The Club is for people who want to make a dent on the international leader boards. It's for people who want to play levels over and over again, refining strategies and skill sets. It's for the more obsessive among us, in other words. Indeed, this is a game where the Tournament mode is really just garnish for the individual events. You work your way through the tournaments to unlock all the levels and get a feel for the different modes and environments, then you drop back to the single event menu and obsessively try and best your scores. And then at the end of each round you see where you are on the relevant leader board and curse the (nick)names of those above you. It's truly engaging stuff, backed by solid level design and reliable aiming mechanics.   A little more super mega rocket power wouldn't go astray in this screenshot.  Of course, the game also has a host of multiplayer modes to dig into if you're itching to shoot another human being in the face in real-time, as opposed to figuratively on a leader board. Free For All game modes (including the deadliest game of all... tag) combine with a number of team game modes, such as Team Siege (one side defends their position for as long as they can while the other assaults it, then vice versa), Team Capture (CTF with foxes) and Team Fox Hunt (again with the foxes  hunt down your opposing team's fox while protecting your own). Player counts are relatively small  eight for online and system link, four for splitscreen, but the multiplayer makes for a nice change of focus, even though it's a bit disappointing that there aren't co-op versions of single player modes like Survivor and Siege. Working together to take down hordes of AI would have been brilliant.   The Club definitely won't be for everyone, but we suspect that there'll be quite a few people out there who won't give it a chance by virtue of the fact that it looks so much like countless other shooters on the market, and thus is weighed down by certain expectations. We're actually a little disappointed that Bizarre Creations didn't go for a more evocative visual design. It's all very well to be gritty, but this isn't a world with a great deal of personality, nor is the 'underground bloodsport league' concept particularly inspired. It looks good, certainly, and takes the player to a range of (decrepit) environments, from Venice and an abandoned Prison to a beached Ocean Liner, but there's nothing wildly original here, and the execution doesn't really jump out at you. Enemies just drop when they die, melee attacks look frightfully goofy and interesting set pieces are few and far between. With so much potential in the concept, we can't help but imagine what the game could have looked like had Bizarre Creations taken a page out of Valve's book and gone with an exaggerated visual design ala Team Fortress 2. As it stands we actually had to turn up the brightness and contrast just to ensure we could pick out all the enemies in the environments.   Did we mention the micro-explosives your avatar has been injected with? Stray beyond the chalk lines and five seconds later... boom! In such a crowded genre its great to see Bizarre Creations do things a little differently. The Club may not look that unique in terms of its visual design, but give it a chance and  if youre anything like us - its high-score ethos will hook you in. Smooth controls, great combo mechanics, a variety of modes and decent level design all combine to create a game thats about rhythm and flow. A little more vivacity in enemies, animations, environments and set-pieces would have been great, but at the end of the day The Club nails its concept and its gameplay.", "date": "Feb 8, 2008"}
