Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild may be a little bit too far behind its console cousin to enjoy the boost, but any sort of recognition is better than nothing on the deck, yes?   Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild is a top-down water racer with a split personality. You can either simple enjoy the waves in a free race mode and practice your moves, or enter into a challenge mode full of races with two other riders. The races are fairly basic, just keep your jetski between the buoys and as far in front as humanly possible. Turning with the thumbpad can be a bit tricky -- things feel a little more sensitive than they should. It's too easy to oversteer at a sharp turn and end up crossing the course boundary, losing precious speed.   The trick mode is a little shallow, but mildly entertaining. You pick from one of there XTREME! personalities and then hop on a jetski. There are jumps everywhere that demand to be, well, jumped. In the air, you can press the pad in a number of different directions to perform tricks. The animations that accompany these tricks look pretty good, and they do seem to have a nice degree of variation.    My biggest complaint about Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild is just that there isn't much to it. The races are too easy to complete -- even with the control issues working against you from time to time -- and the trick stuff is burned through in an hour or two. And, honestly, where are these rides that are allegedly going so wild?   Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild actually looks pretty good. The screen is dominated by water, of course, but the player sprites have a decent amount of detail (although, they really look like only one sprite with different coats of paint) and those buoys? Magnificent! Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild also features a fair amount of audio, such as an opening jingle.  I wanted more out of Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild than I got. I was a big fan of the PlayStation 2 edition of this game, and while I expect a mobile game to be watered down, this was really sopping wet. The races are over in a flash once you teach yourself not to oversteer and the trick stuff is just too simplistic compared to the other ~extreme~ games on the decks, like Tony Hawk. You might get an hour or so of entertainment out of Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild, but it's hard for me to recommend spending your money on just that.", "date": "Sep 2, 2005"}
