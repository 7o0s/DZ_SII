That's what bam! Entertainment has tried with its latest game, Driven, which is based on the horrible movie that starred Sylvester Stallone and the incredibly hot, but not hot enough to save the movie, Estella Warren. The results, as you'd probably expect, are pretty bad.   Gameplay  It's kind of odd, though, because this game isn't really bad because a lack of effort. It does appear that the developers of Driven actually thought a lot of things out and have done a good job of putting together a base for a solid videogame. Along with the basic arcade mode, it has a nice storyline mode that loosely follows the movie with a nice mix of training sessions and real races that are split up with story segments that feature hand-drawn stills with voices for the onscreen characters. It actually makes decent use of the license, it's just sad that the license isn't all that exciting to begin with.   The problem with it all is that the good there is in the game, as far as its structure and design are concerned, won't ever be seen because the core of the game -- the racing -- is so poor. The racing is a strange mix of arcade-like and simulation-like elements. It feels like an arcade racer and doesn't require realistic braking and acceleration mechanics to excel. But at the same time, it's very unforgiving to mistakes in a way that you'd expect from a sim. You're punished severely for mistakes that would be acceptable in a simulation, but not in its arcade environment with very clunky and twitchy steering controls. What they've done here is create a racing game that's simply not fun to play.    Graphics  Maybe it's because I was so under-whelmed by the game itself, but the graphics in Driven didn't seem all that bad to me. With up to 12 cars on the track at once, the framerate was generally constant, the background seemed adequately detailed and the game as a whole doesn't look all that bad. It's not visually impressive by any means, but there aren't any substantial flaws that need to be mentioned. There are also a lot of breakable parts on the cars, as well as others that are animated nicely. Driven isn't a great looking PlayStation 2 game, but it's not all that bad looking, either.   Sound  Most of the sound you'll hear in this game will be pretty average and completely unmoving. The music is on the bad side, but the voices are passable in a cheesy kind of way, and the engine noises are completely run-of-the-mill. You're definitely not going to get the variety of engine sounds here that you'll get from F1 or Cart simulations, but it's kind of what you'd probably expect from this particular game.There's actually a lot of good in Driven. The game has been designed fairly well in that there's a lot of stuff to unlock and the progression to unlock drivers and tracks is quite nice. The developers have also done a good job of making use of the license and incorporating things like getting ~in the zone~ into the gameplay. However, all of this ends up being for naught because of the game's horrible controls. Because of this, the game just isn't any fun to play.", "date": "Nov 12, 2001"}
