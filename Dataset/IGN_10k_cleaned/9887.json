Starting on the NES and moving on to becoming the Neo Geo arcade and home system's most popular sports game, Baseball Stars was arguably the best of the 8  and 16-bit baseball titles -- despite not having a Major League license. And now, SNK brings its series to the Neo Geo Pocket Color. Features: Arcade-action baseball  For one or two players  Link cable support  For Neo Geo Pocket Color   The Neo Geo Pocket Color version of Baseball Stars isn't based on any existing version of the series. It's a scaled-down, arcade-style game of baseball, and for the handheld market that's just fine. Honestly, I would have loved it if SNK just ported the NES version of Baseball Stars over to the Neo Geo Pocket Color. It was (and still is) a fantastic game of baseball, especially with its massive create-a-league option. Instead, the Neo Geo Pocket Color version of the game is more scaled back and lacks any options other than the standard one or two-player modes. Don't expect to see Playoff or Championship modes, because they're not in here. Fake players, fake teams, just a straight-forward game of stick. But that's where the charm lies.  You'll be able to send in pinch hitters and replacement pitchers in the game, and you can turn the designated pitcher mode on or off at the beginning of the game. One very arcade feature is to utilize one ~powerup~ at anytime during the game  bring up a power hitter or pitcher to really give your opponent what-for. But use him wisely, you only get to do it once. And keep a watch on your players, since a little icon at the bottom of the screen tells you how hot, cold, or tired he is.  Graphically, it's that big-head style that's sweeping the Japanese nation  though not as exaggerated as Namco's offering. The game takes place in two perspectives: behind the batter during pitches, and an over-the-field camera when the ball is hit. And when you nail a dinger over the wall, you're presented with a rather dynamic sequence. Though, I'm not quite sure what ~Bagoon!~ means... Baseball Stars Color is a great-playing handheld version of baseball, though you're going to feel like something's missing if you're looking for a title that covers all the bases. It looks good, feels good, and plays really well. Now, if the game had all the awesome features of the NES version, I'd be in heaven.", "date": "Jul 21, 1999"}
