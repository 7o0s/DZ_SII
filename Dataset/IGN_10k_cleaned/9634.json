Usually that much dough'll get you a crappy third-party accessory, some bargain-bin game or one-sixth of a title you really want. It's enough to make Alexander Hamilton want to curl up and go the way of the two-dollar bill.   Syphon Filter: Combat Ops intends to change all that.     Available exclusively on the PC PlayStation Store -- i.e. you're going to have to use your computer and the web to get this title instead of your PS3 -- Combat Ops is a well-organized multiplayer-only affair that gives rabid WiFi fans something to cheer about.    Now, if you were picking Combat Ops up just after finishing Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow, you might be a bit peeved at first. The ziplines, exploding barrels and combat techniques are all ripped from Gabe's October mission, there are fewer maps but the same number of modes, and the interface is a carbon copy with the exception that everything is in red now rather than blue.     But what makes Combat Ops a standout is Mission Modifier. Whereas in Logan's Shadow your multiplater matches were limited to what scenarios Sony posted -- seven maps in Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Rogue Agent, Retrieval (a la CTF) and Sabotage (i.e. objective-based stuff like blowing up an opponent's bomb) modes -- Combat Ops gives you the tools to make your own missions, give them a story and unleash them on the world.   This game will live or die on user-created content.   When you enter the Mission Modifier, you're given a bevy of choices. To begin with, you'll need to pick one of four locations -- fortress, village, aerospace and ruins. Now, that might sound like weak sauce compared to the seven in Logan's Shadow, but once your locale is selected, you'll get to choose from lists as to what your central zone is, what your alpha zone is and what your beta zone is. Basically, you get to put together different puzzle pieces in a three-part formula to create your kindred killing field.   Say you select the fortress as your location. You'll have four options for the main area (trenches, trenches & tunnels, dividing wall, and wall & tunnels), five options for the first add-on (nothing, castle, stables, bunker, and stronghold) and another four choices for the third portion (nothing, bunker, and stronghold). From there you'll need to choose if you want to battle it out in the daylight or nighttime, whether you want the weather to be a factor (it can be clear, foggy, raining, snowing, dusty or flooded), and which two of nine squads you want players to pop up during the match.   Boom! Finish all that preliminary stuff and you get down the nuts and bolts of battle. You choose which type combat your mission is all about; set up spawn points, barrels, turrets, ziplines and more; and pick from more than 55 weapons to place in the gaming space.   Now, all that sounds awesome -- and it is -- but there is a catch. You're not just let loose on your custom map to create spawn points and weapons wherever you please. When you get into editing a level, you'll find dozens of red boxes across the map. You target the boxes, select them and choose to activate what's inside. Some contain barrels, other ziplines and so on. Basically, customizing your level comes down to choosing which options are activated and which aren't. There are tons of these options on the map -- so you really do have a wide array of choices in front of you -- but it is the glass ceiling of this game.    The best thing for me -- a nerdy, wordy kid? After your map's setup, you get to name the location and enter a mission description that'll be visible to all the players as the they go into the game. Want to have your friends battle it out in the ruins and create some crafty story about the TV writer's strike flooding the market with reality television and thus driving everyone insane and that this battle is between the devotees of A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila and followers of I Love New York 2? Have at it. In the end, you'll get to vote on the map you just played.   Notice how I said ~friends~ back there? That wasn't a word I just tossed in. Although I really dug my time with Combat Ops -- you create buddy and favorite lists, it supports voice chat, you create favorite lists, there are message boards, you can join clans -- I had a hard time getting games in.   No one's playing this thing yet.   Now, there could be a lot of reasons for this -- last week was a holiday, people could be waiting for reviews, etc. -- but the fact of the matter is that you could have trouble getting into matches. I tried playing the day it was released, Sunday afternoon and Monday morning and had extremely limited success. Even when I got in, I was pretty much owned by the other players but came up ranked 89th in the world.     If I'm 89, there must only be 93 people playing this game. I'm sure I could get better, but I'd need to find matches first.   Am I faulting the game for not having a lot of players? Nah  well, maybe a little -- it is a multiplayer game after all -- but the sparse number of players online, signals to me that this game might only appeal to the hardcore SF fan. That's fine and non-hardcore SF players are going to miss a great experience, but a small sect of fans might not make for a great whenever-you-want title.Should you buy Syphon Filter: Combat Ops? Yes. It's ten bucks, and even if you only create two or three maps and play'em online, the fun and frantic missions should cover the cost. This game's deep and easy to play, but my only worry is how long it'll be fun to keep playing. If the install base doesn't beef up, you might be left with a worthwhile title only a few fans are using at prearranged times. It might be hard to just pop into a game while you're waiting in your doctor's office.Still, you should pick this up -- it's a shining example of how online on the PSP -- voice, votes, boards and user content -- should work.", "date": "Nov 27, 2007"}
