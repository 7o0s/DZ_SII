There is still plenty of ~homemade~ fun to be found on cellphones from developers and publishers without major moolah behind them. Tom Seago Games' Alex the Ant is one of those little gems that bubbles to the surface briefly, beforer getting relegated (and subsequently, lost) into a carrier's catalog.  Features:  Tile moving action! Save game feature Uh, ants!  Remember that old game Pipe Dream, where you had to direct the water out of a maze by moving tiles around, matching up the right pipes with proper joints? Well, Alex the Ant is like that, but instead of moving aqua, you've got to create a dirt highway so the little fella can reach the surface.  It's a simple tile-moving game, designed so anybody can quickly get into it. Now, simple games are always appreciated -- especially on cellphones where too much ambition cana ctually capsize you. Alex starts on in a small empty patch, and you must rearrange the tiles to forge his path to the surface -- all set against a time limit.  There are twenty-five dirty levels for Alex to survive. And, trust us, this isn't as easy as it sounds. Rearranging tiles in the upper levels is some serious brain work, as if you allow the wandering Alex to step into nothingness, it's game over. Fortunately, there is a save game feature that allows you to instantly hold you place sound you need to, we dunno, listen to whoever is speaking at the front of the room.  We said simple was good, but there is also such a thing as too simple, and this is where dollars comes back into play. Alex the Ant is fun as it is, but some production values wouldn't have necessarily hurt. For one thing, the opening theme is dreadfully basic. And it's not like we're playing a visual masterpiece that leaves no room for better audio. Couldn't the developer at least squeezed in a better tune? ~Teddy Bears Picnic,~ fer Pete's sake?  (Hey, that reminds us of an old Commodore 64 game called ~Hunchback.~ Somebody should port that to handsets.)Simple and fun, Alex the Ant is a good download for handset owners looking for a basic distraction. But beware, it's only basic for so long. By the end, you will be exceeding frustrated with the severity of the puzzles. And by frustrated, we mean hooked.", "date": "Jan 31, 2004"}
