{"name": "Sea Dogs", "name_review": "Sea Dogs", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/01/sea-dogs", "text": "Pirates! is arguably one of the greatest PC games of all time.  In an age where most programmers would've been happy outdoing Seven Cities of Gold, Sid Meier's masterpiece was simulating swordfights, naval battles, economics, and practically every other aspect of the swashbuckler's lifestyle.  As successful as the title was though, few attempts at recapturing its former glory have been made.  Sure, we've had Cutthroats recently, but it failed to capture that classic spirit.  So when Bethesda Softworks, known mainly these days for its Elder Scrolls series, announced they'd be making a buccaneer RPG, people sat up and took notice.  While it's undeniably true that Sea Dogs, the publisher's latest, paints a killer new spin on a stagnant niche.  However, the product's a bit too beefy for its own good.  In this particular case, all the statistics and hot keys in the world won't convince a gamer that bigger necessarily equals better.  Those who get worked up over the rousing intro sequence will soon be reminded why most role-playing games are geared for exceedingly patient crowds.  After learning of your alter ego's daring escape from a Spanish prison in the 17th Century, the title leaves players' fortune in their hands.  The first order of business is becoming familiar with your character, who sports a dizzying array of skills and talents.  Like a traditional dungeon crawl, this adventure awards collectable experience points that enhance a captain's rank and related attributes.  Surprisingly, much care should be invested in the upgrade process, as marked performance improvements come as a direct result of boosting particular areas of expertise.  Essentially, the manner in which you assign bonus points determines what sort of corsair your character is at heart.  Focus on the persona's sailing, gunplaying, and reloading skills, for instance, and he'll be a terror in battle.  Choose instead to highlight boarding, grappling, and commerce areas and the Cap'n should dominate close range battles, afterwards fetching top dollar for any captured booty.  These talents may also be further improved by hiring on officers, who contribute to the cause in exchange for a monthly salary.  There's even a reputation factor that fluctuates according to a man's deeds, affecting his relationship with certain individuals in the game.  It's a system that works amazingly well under the circumstances, especially regarding rank (aka experience level) evolution, as the higher a sailor's rating, the more powerful ships he can command.  As the tale progresses, character development becomes an even more fascinating process, masterfully drawing players ever deeper into the plot.    Still a man hungry for booty can't randomly sail the silicon seas forever.  That's what quests are for, as these splendid side treks will keep that creative energy focused when one's tired of raiding gold-laden galleons.  In much the same way as Pirates! had town governors assign letters of marquee and missions, so too do the head honchos at each settlement's Town Hall dole out errands and business propositions.  Although the game deserves mucho credit for letting seaman drum up business of their own through chance meetings at stores and taverns, official business is where they'll turn in pursuit of the grandiose storyline.  Players will find the bevy of diversions a welcome, comfortable feature that could get even the most clueless cutthroat back on track.   Yet full 3D walking jaunts through town and countless branching dialogue conversations with garishly garbed NPCs aren't all the product has to offer.  Utilizing a crystal clear navigational map method, peg-legged wanderers can traverse the ocean blue.  Town icons where ships may put ashore open as you trigger certain events or speak with key people, though a salty dog can stay at sea as long as he's got sufficient wages for a potentially mutinous crew.  During lean years, or bouts of boredom, the sea lanes and merchant routes between colonies translate into prime pickings for swashbucklers with the moxie and manpower to take what isn't rightfully theirs.    Funny thing is, the amount of detail invested in the waterway encounters will astound you.  Sail the British, French, or Spanish shores and you'll run into ships of the appropriate nationality, plus emissaries from friendly nations who've come on business trips.  Many times a captain will find himself attacked by pirates or embroiled in an already ongoing hostile situation.  Alerted by a message window that keeps tabs on such matters of importance, investigating an encounter is largely an optional selection, though conflict isn't always avoidable.  Just be careful whom aggression is levied at, because pissing off a sovereign nation causes them to close all borders and attack or run away on sight, though force of arms can invariably remedy these issues.  Hey kids, can you say ~might makes right?~  Pimping a sloop, pinnace, bark, corvette, warship or any of the product's dozen or so other craft out with cannons and crew alone won't guarantee success in battle, though.  An intricate sailing model demands that captains learn to maneuver like yachting pros, as battles generally hinge on who can jockey into firing position the fastest.  What's truly amazing is how you can dynamically switch into a first person mode at any time wherein a targeting cursor may be used to manually direct several types of shot at enemy sails, rigging and crew.  Personal touches like this and the spyglass zoom function, which provides insight on an opposing vessel's strength, create a palpable atmosphere of tension that's absolutely freakin' awesome.  Hell, there isn't a landlubber alive who won't get aroused when they punch visible holes and burning tears in their opponent's sails and hull.  Close in on the bastards and you can also board in hopes of taking the ship, following one wholly enjoyable duel with a rival captain.  Unfortunately there's nevertheless a significant amount of troubles siphoning the wind from Sea Dogs' sails.  Overwhelmingly, the title feels, looks, and plays like Microprose's classic Pirates!, yet adds a staggering amount of conceptual layers to the production.  Regardless, one can't help but feel that complicating matters wasn't really necessary and, quite frankly, only increases the appeal for a relatively small population of gamers out there.  Nobody's arguing with the inherent value of an in-depth storyline, massive multiple ship battles, a sophisticated marketplace, and NPC interaction.  But is a walking traipse through town and its associated load times really necessary?  Or multi-key swordfights?  Should players really have to worry about hiring a purser (translation: accountant), fetching a bottle of wine for a no-good guard, or witnessing firsthand the umpteen variations of effects hull degradation has on combat performance?  It all seems like much ado over nothing, with Sid's aging baby having covered most of these subjects marvelously well with 16 colors, one mouse, and two buttons.  Furthermore, as beautiful and detailed as the environments are, they lack a sense of grit and urgency.  Everything's so pretty, yet spartan in personality, that it's as if the world was a gigantic doctor's office; fashionably charming, yet uncomfortably sterilized.  Thus while combat and commonplace sailing sequences are a lovely sight to behold, with the ship models and wave effects unequaled by any nautical competitor, they're noticeably tame.  More sound effects or speech samples would've done wonders for the generally quiet battles, as the lapping of the ocean and light battle hymn that plays in the background can't compare to a one eyed thug screaming ~Cut they're bleedin' nards off, Cap'n!~  Aesthetically, towns feature similar decor, though there at least you'll have the pleasure of hearing a few professional sounding period-specific voiceovers from the usually talkative populace.  Let it not be said that Sea Dogs' voyage ended in infamy, however.  Quite the contrary, as this is an excellent game that deserves mounting on any dedicated seafarer's monitor.  In a way, Akella bit off more than it could chew when the company attempted to recreate and revamp so many facets of a time-honored masterwork that they couldn't all fall perfectly into place.  Still you've gotta give 'em credit for trying and realize that as with any first run at a project of this scale, problems are gonna arise. If God is merciful and just, he'll bless this game with enough sell-through to justify a sequel, because Lord knows it deserves one.  Meanwhile though, be thankful for what you've got: an epic swashbuckling adventure that's sailing on mostly smooth, but sometimes turbulent waters.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
