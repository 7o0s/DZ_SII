Sometimes that's how we feel around here. We haven't done any official studies yet, but I'm willing to bet that Star Trek as a franchise has spawned more games than any other property out there. As a reviewer, you've got to get past whatever feelings you have about the show, good or bad, and get at the actual game itself. And you thought this job was easy...  I approached Klingon Academy as a game, not as a vehicle for the Star Trek attitude. I like the idea of capital ships fighting for control of empty space. Klingon Academy definitely has that epic feel to it, with lots of gigantic ships twisting and turning around each other in an effort to destroy one another. But to be honest, after playing through the game, I kind of got enthusiastic about the Star Trek aspects. Don't get me wrong, I'm not surgically altering my ears or building a motorized wheelchair with a cardboard box covering it or anything, but I think the game is better because of the license.  For some people, the most important thing about this game will be the Star Trek license. For the rest of us, it all boils down to ship control. If the ships aren't any fun to fly, then not all the Birds of Prey in the world can save it. Fortunately, the ship interface is pretty well designed. I prefer using the joystick to control the ship, but you can just as easily use the keyboard or the mouse to steer yourself around. Since you're in command of a capital ship, it's a little different than playing StarLancer or Tachyon. These ships are sluggish and slow and you won't be getting into any dogfights here.  I also found the ship controls to be pretty versatile. While the steering isn't so great, the individual station controls are pretty sweet. Your engineer will handle power allocation and repairs, two of the most critical functions on the ship. The helmsman will handle warps although I found it's almost impossible to rely on him to steer the ship for you. You've also got a comms officer, a science officer, weapons officer, security officer, etc. Each of these stations serves a vital role. There's even an option for you to man the separate stations individually although I found that the level of control at the station interface was more than I needed. You're the captain; you're supposed to stay on the bridge anyway.  As a consequence of the ponderous steering of the ships, you're bound to run into someone every now and then. This to me is the best and worst thing about the game. It's fantastic that the collision modeling is so severe. One of my main complaints against the other space games to come out recently is the lack of a believable collision system. In Klingon Academy you can totally destroy your ship with one or two thoughtless collisions. The realism of it is very satisfying.  But the frequency of it happening is far too high. Ships will often come at you head on in a total disregard of their own survival. I can understand this from a nearly beaten opponent. This type of last-ditch effort is expected. But for a fully healthy ship to suddenly decide to ram you is a little silly. This problem is made worse by the fact that the match speed command only matches a target's current speed. It doesn't readjust itself when the target speeds up or slows down. You will often rear-end another ship as a result. I don't know; maybe I'm just a bad driver.  Perhaps we're all too used to thinking in terms of Wing Commander, but there's a real scale issue here as well. It's very hard to tell how big the ships are -- especially when they're in the vicinity of a planet. And the planets seem kind of on the smallish side. I don't know how big these ships are supposed to be in real-life-fiction-whatever but they seem too big next to the planets.  As good as the graphics are, they could be better. Obviously you can say that about just about any game, but Klingon Academy's graphics are actually a little distracting. The ship models are all right but the textures are just convincing enough to give you the right impression. The occasional texture-clipping problem makes it all that much worse. The models for planets and asteroids are composed of too few polygons to really give the impression of something round as well. The weapon and damage effects are well handled and the little parts that come flying off the ships when you hit them are really cool. I also like that you can blow off huge sections of the ships (although the sub targeting option seems not to work so well).  I have to say that the full-motion video sequences in this game are really spectacular. It's not like there's a lot of action happening on the screen but the quality of the image is better than just about any we've seen recently. The fact that Christopher Plummer does all the mission briefings makes it that much better.  The sequences with Chris are very useful in getting the player into the Klingon mindset. I'm not one of these folks who rushed right out and bought a copy of Hamlet in Klingon or anything. In fact, I think people who read Shakespeare in Klingon have ~issues.~ But the Klingons as a race have a very distinct character and philosophy. They're very warlike and proud and that certainly comes across in the little per talks Christopher Plummer gives you before each mission. Better still, each mission is named after a line from Shakespeare. And you all know how the Klingons love Shakespeare, right?  The actual content of the missions is pretty satisfying. You'll need not only race around the universe and kill things. You'll also need to run escort missions, do a little spying and make it home in time for Tok'favh. Don't ask. Mr. Plummer might even call you into his office and ask you to do a special favor for him. No, not that kind of favor. You'll get drawn into the political infighting and subterfuge that's going on in the Klingon Empire at this time in its history.  Once you get the briefing, you hop in your ship and take off. The little load screen gives you a few pointers and reminds you of some of the more important key commands. You don't get to pick your ship or outfit your crew or anything. Like the real military, what they give you is what you have to work with. Occasionally you'll be entrusted with some new technology but for the most part, you'll be battling your enemies in pretty standard ships.  The missions will change on the fly as well, so you'd better be prepared. The missions aren't dynamic in the sense of changing every time you play them. For the most part, any events in a given mission are bound to repeat themselves no matter how many times you play it. But the mission will change from what you were told in the briefing. Luckily your commanders keep you up to date on changes in your mission objectives.  The main problem is that the missions are ass-hard. Now I'm not one to complain about a game being a challenge. I totally expect a game to challenge me and I'm unhappy when it doesn't. But in this case, the missions are almost entirely fought from a position of disadvantage. You're always outnumbered and the tendency of the other ship captains to ram your ship at full speed had me throwing my joystick right at the back of Trent's head. It helps a little that your Klingon ships can cloak, but once the battle is joined, you'll be fighting for your life.  The multiplayer side of the game is pretty fun. You can set up battles between up to 16 players with as many teams. And it's not just limited to Klingons and Federation either. You can choose to fight aboard the ships of the Romulan and Gorn empires as well. There are even a few other types of ships for other races in the game. Mutliplay is handled either as a kill limit or time limit affair in any of several arenas. I was a little surprised that your comm. menu won't let you send messages to your allies, but it's not the worst thing ever.  Klingon Academy has two things going for it. First off is the whole Star Trek thing. I admit that I did enjoy this game on this level. Not being a big fan of the show and all I expected not to get caught up in the whole Klingon thing, but the mission briefings and the ship models really reinforce the Star Trek idea. The second thing going for this game is its atypical character. There aren't too many capital ship games out there and those of us who love space drama have had to content ourselves with action on a much smaller scale. There's something undeniably exciting about gigantic ships battling it out just above the surface of a gas giant...like Vincent Lopez for instance.  -- Stephen Butts", "date": "Jun 24, 2000"}
