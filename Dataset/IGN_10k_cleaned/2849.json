With the PlayStation 2 receiving no less than seven football games before month's end, finding the proper gridiron title to suit your tastes has become quite the difficult proposition. Throw in the fact that three of those games are absolutely phenomenal (NCAA Football 2003, Madden NFL 2003, and NFL 2K3 to be specific), and making a choice between them becomes even more of a challenge.   One of those choices is 989 Sports brand new college offering, NCAA GameBreaker. Younger brother (and oftentimes forgotten property) of 989's premiere franchise NFL GameDay, the collegiate interpretation of Red Zone's football engine has never fully lived up to its predecessors success. Unfortunately, with the 2003 edition now firmly in our grasp, it appears that that tradition is still firmly in place.   Features  Nearly identical to this year's version of NFL GameDay, GameBreaker has most of the same options and features that you'll find in other football games. Complete seasons, one-game scrimmages, and full-on dynasty mode have made the cut for die-hard fans. However, two of my favorite inclusions that made it into GameDay (16:9 Widescreen support and Online Play) have been nixed from the college version all together.   On paper, what's left sounds pretty solid, as 117 Division I-A teams join 60 historical squads for your selection, and a handful of bowl games and post-season awards are up for the taking as well. Appreciated as this is, the replay incentive introduced by NCAA Football 2003 via the pennant system is one of the most powerful forces behind that game's success. Against competition like that, there should be a whole lot more to offer the player in terms of return value than a couple of hidden stadiums (most notably the inside of a UFO and the remnants of a Roman Gladiatorial coliseum).   If you're just looking for the once through though, there's plenty to keep you occupied for your first time. As both create-a-player and the dynasty sections are rather extensive, and should challenge the simulation nuts out there with a healthy dose of ~what if~ scenarios. While not as personable as the franchise options found in NFL 2K3 or the aforementioned EA NCAA title, it's still built on a solid foundation.   Gameplay  It's biggest hitch in past years, GameBreaker has always played second fiddle in the gameplay department to Electronic Arts own college gig NCAA Football 2003. Strangely enough, it's widely believed that the GameBreaker series has had moments of transcendence over its inspiration GameDay which in turn used to give Madden a run for it's money. Confusing as that might sound, it all breaks down to whether or not the game is any good for the consumer. And in 2003, GameBreaker finds itself somewhere below that description.   My biggest issue with the game really, is just how easy it is to scramble. Regardless of which team I controlled or who I was facing, moving my quarterback past the scrimmage line for 10-15 yards every time I attempted it was a breeze. In fact, in the over 20 scrambles I attempted, 14 of them were for over 10 yards. Four more of them went 5 yards, and I was only stopped twice. As popular as the scramble play is in college football, a success rate that high is totally unacceptable, and any semblance of a challenge fades away with it. How will Joe Average ever improve their game or learn it more effectively if they can run the same money play every time?   The same issue arose when running the ball with a good halfback. Nearly unstoppable when in possession, it was almost as though any guy with the number ~2~ was the second coming of Marshall Faulk. Eventually the games I played against both humans and the CPU resorted in a competition to see who could scramble/run the ball more. Whoever did so faster would eventually win the game. The only way around it was to limit myself in such plays and honestly force myself into throwing the ball to see what would happen. Running it would guarantee a victory.   With such a lopsided offensive factor rearing its ugly head into my sessions, I found myself immediately turned off. After numerous games and plenty of toggled options, difficulties, and self-imposed handicaps, the rest of the game's stellar convictions (like the responsive passing system, tackles, and air defense) were rendered null and void. And before I knew it, GameBreaker had gone from a title with potential to one that had been stunted. All because of a major balancing flaw.   Graphics  First let me point out that if football games were judged solely on their ability to have excellent helmet reflections, NCAA GameBreaker would win the competition. Tied only by its engine-sharing counterpart, NFL GameDay, the highly realistic brain armor not only shimmers with light, but mirrors the surrounding stadiums as well. Look hard enough at the durable plastic, and you can see all the warped details of the arena around you complete with sideline images, lampposts, and more. A subtle yet noticeable visual touch, the helmets look great.   Also of note are the tackle animations. Easily eclipsing the efforts of EA's mighty NCAA Football franchise, each and every rumble is handled with the utmost of realism. Jersey grabbing, double-teaming, stumble-breaks, and plenty of other true to life motions are the highlight of every defensive maneuver. Red Zone should definitely receive kudos for doing tackles the proper way.   It's just too bad that grass textures, player faces, and uniforms don't live up to the same visual standard. On the low end in comparison to both Sega and Electronic Arts versions of the college game, the under-detailed player models are not only taking the field in low-res, but also fall victim to the curse of early-generation blockiness. Too angular for its own good, the not-quite human characters are a little hard to take in today's visually powerful market.   Another disappointment was the treatment given to the camera angles. Not quite in the right position for maximum field viewing, I noticed that the camera was usually either too close or too far away from the action to keep me on top of things. I recommend switching to the ~classical~ option for the best possible view, but even when using that angle there's something not quite right with the results. Combine that with a somewhat cluttered (yet informative) interface, and you could have a strenuous ocular adventure ahead of you.   Oh and before I forget, I have to mention the gaudy icons. Far too big for their own good, the oversized symbols for passing are a tad on the ridiculous side. Almost giving the impression that the game is aimed towards children, the gargantuan spinning icons could conceivably draw attention away from the field because of their Broadway-like flamboyance.   Sound  Possibly the game's weakest category, the audio in GameBreaker is decidedly under par. Bland and inactive, the commentary sounds as though it isn't even there. Despite numerous touchdowns on both sides of the scrimmage line, the most they could muster was a rather dull ~And that's a touchdown~. No fanfare, no excitement, no drama. Though I'll admit that there's more to college football than its announcers, the complete lack of enthusiasm in this version is mind-boggling.   Also missed are the fight songs. A key attribute when trying to capture that college atmosphere, team-specific songs can mean a lot. And while there are a couple of recognizable tunes in GameBreaker, there aren't nearly enough. Furthermore, why are the marching bands recorded so low? Another area in which the importance of sound was underplayed, the quietly humble trombones don't very supportive of their teams.   At least some of the special effects are cool. Like the clang that's made when bouncing the ball off of a goal post, or the painful grunting whenever there's a hard tackle. All in all however, the aural aspect of GameBreaker appears as though it was almost entirely overlooked.Still the redheaded stepchild of the videogame football world, NCAA GameBreaker returns to the PlayStation 2 as an average effort to the land of first downs. Marred by a poor representation of the scrambling and running game and just now as personable as EA's collegiate masterpiece, the GameBreaker crew may want to go back to the drawing board for 2004.", "date": "Aug 12, 2002"}
