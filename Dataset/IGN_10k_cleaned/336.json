Logical may not be that great, but it gets points for originality. Features 99 levels Changeable speed Only for Game Boy Color  In Logical, you're faced with a five-by-six grid of squares and a pipe that spans the top of it. At the beginning of each round, the field will consist of a unique pipeline and series of four-slotted gears. Balls, one at a time, will roll across the top pipe and into this network of pipes and gears. Your task  rotate the gears to drop the balls into the slots. When four balls of the same color fill a gear, they disappear and note that gear with a ~notch.~ When all gears have been ~notched,~ the level's over.  Ah, it may sound simple  and actually, it is for the first few levels. Then, other elements enter play. First, the one-way pipes: some pipes, noted by arrows, can only allow balls to travel through them one way. Then come the color stops: in the middle of some pipes are colored blocks  only that colored ball can travel through that pipe. Finally, traffic lights  at the bottom of the screen you'll see an order of colors. You have to drop the balls into the slots in that order.  There's also a time element: if you let a ball travel back and forth over the top of the screen too long, you'll lose a ~try.~ And in the same vein, if you take too long with a specific puzzle, you also lose a try. Three tries and you're out. Thankfully, you've got a password system to get you through the easy levels of the game.  Unfortunately, the game may be original, but it's just not that much fun to play. It doesn't feel like a puzzle game, more like a series of tasks you have to complete. The time element isn't much of one in the early levels, so you have plenty of time to plan your route of attack. And there's really no place where you can make any fatal mistakes in a panic  a typical fumble in reflex puzzle games. The game does have two speed levels, just in case the default setting is a bit slow paced for your tastes. And in all honesty, the game's better in the faster speed.   I was hoping for something different when I plopped Logical in my Game Boy Color  I was expecting one of those sliding-tile games (like Locomotion). But instead, I got a puzzle game that didn't quite make too much sense at the beginning  I had to pop out the manual to realize what you had to do. After ten levels in a row, I just didn't feel like wanting to play this game any more  a shame, since the idea is unique, and very non-Tetris. I don't recommend avoiding the game, but I doubt you'll be playing this game much if you add it to your library.", "date": "Oct 21, 1999"}
