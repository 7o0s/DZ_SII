But it was Electronic Arts that -- having recently picked through the remains of a bleeding Virgin library -- snagged the not-so-good-looking Super Car GT with full knowledge of Gran Turismo and its predecessor. So, after the poor judgment that led to the steaming pile of data called Rushdown, EA heads to the loser's locker room yet again with a game that just makes Gran Turismo look better and better.  Super Car GT is a sports car simulation featuring arcade aspects such as car damage and relatively forgiving AI, that sports 45-licensed cars and a handful of tracks. It's a decent overall racer. But the game's biggest problems outweigh its best ones. The outdated graphics engine, lack of tracks, and the global sense that this title may have been great in 1997  not 1999  fail to impress in the competitive racing market of 1999. Gameplay This game suffers from the classic case of a good physics engine with generally realistic gameplay attached to graphics that look like the dog-faced girl next door. I guess that's OK, but most folks want both a good playing and a nice looking game all in one nice little package.   Gamers can choose from as many as than 45 licensed cars, including the Porsche 911, Porsche 911GT1, Callaway C7, C12, BMW M3, Saleen Mustang S281, Saleen SR, Vector M-12, Lister Storm, Panoz GTR-1, and the Mosler Raptor, among others. It must be said that no other games (other than Need for Speed: High Stakes) have the Porsche license in 1999, which means that if you're the fanatical Porsche fan we think you are, you'll be interested in playing, or at least renting, Super Car GT. We certainly enjoyed the 911s a great deal because of their excellent torque, speed, and handling abilities.  With a full Season mode in which players can earn and modify their cars, players will have their hands full for a while. The season enables players to race through a paltry five courses and jump from a series of classes, including Qualifying (where the max speed is 140 mph), Class 1 (160 mph), Class 2 (170 mph), and Class 3 (200 mph). Those who like to compete against another may fancy the Pink Slip Mode, a Xerox of the latest Need For Speed's High Stakes mode, where the winner nicks the loser's car from their memory card for good. And for late night fanatics, you can race forever, or at least close to it, in a mode that enables 24-hour gameplay.   The game also features Arcade and Time Trial modes. Arcade mode provides about 15 different cars from all three classes and allows immediate access to all courses. Time Trial is just that, a race against time for top scores.   With physics that aren't to die for but that hang in the pretty-damn-good section of the scale, players will have their hands full around many courses' 180 degree turns and undulating slopes. Cars will slip in the sand or grass, or if they hit an opponent, they'll often lose grip or spin out of control. The cars handle especially dangerously when the weather changes; players will need to reconsider their strategy at high speeds around otherwise routine turns.   Instant recognition of the car variety can be seen and felt in switching from the Arcade mode (in which some of the best cars are choosable) to the Season mode (where only four rather unexciting car choices are available at first). After each race, gamers earn money to buy new cars or modify their existing one. Modifications affect brakes, suspension, exhaust, engine, gearbox, aero kit, and tires. Each change is categorized into different packages, ranging from Street Performance, Track Brake, Performance Racing, and Professional Racing, each costing incrementally more cash. Players also can mess around with the number of laps (1-30) and day or night changes.  Graphics The game's worst aspect is its graphics. It simply looks outdated, like it a Model T in a new car lot bursting with Rolls Royces. If you want 1997 graphics, well then hey hey! You're in luck, buddy. But most people don't, so beware, this game looks like a rusty old Saturn game.   The graphics suffer in almost every department and range from dull coloring and ho-hum textures to heavy-duty pixelation and a serious case of the jaggies. Cars ahead of you look like crushed Pop-tarts with wheels and courses in general look as if a marching parade complete with horses, donkeys, and elephants trashed the tracks just before race time.   Oddly (or maybe not so oddly), the frame rate is not terrible. It's decent almost all of time, whether four cars or one fill the screen. Of course, it's rare when more than three cars on onscreen at one time because there are usually only six cars in each race, and they're all spaced out to specifically avoid frame rates dropping.  One of the nice aspects of the graphics, however, can be found in the weather. The rain looks good and it definitely affects your race. Also, lightning comes into play. It's simply a nice little positive graphic note amongst the onslaught of negative ones.   Gamers can turn off or on car damage if they choose to, and if you like flying triangles that flip and flit around, the damage to these cars is OK. The cars don't look any different, but stuff flies off them.  Sound Probably one of the most mediocre aspects of the game is its music and sound effects. They're not great, they're not terrible. It's like kissing your sister. Using a simple set of no-name, non-memorable techno beats, the songs simply click along, effectively nullifying the whole music experience. It's not as bad as N64's San Francisco Rush, but the music is simply there to fill a hole, not necessarily to pump you up or enhance your sensory experience.   The sound effects are slimmed down to almost nothing. They come in about four flavors, maxxed out engines, rain and thunder, a generic crowd, and the announcer. That's it, I'm afraid, nothing more interesting than that. Overall, this title didn't have any kind of sound strategy at all other than to have SOMETHING there to plug the hole. <PI was not surprised by Super Car GT in any way. Way back when I saw screen-shots, I thought, ~Ooohh, that games looks like crap.~ And then when I received the final game, in a whiff of stunning deja vu, I felt no different. Woah!But as they say, graphics do not a game make. So, after playing through several seasons and checking out many of the cars, I was also non-plussed, and felt exactly the same. My real first impression of Super Car GT was completely the same from start to finish. I suppose this sounds harsh, but it's my honest opinion. The professional licenses, especially the Porsche license, help give the game some credibility, but it's not enough to save it from falling through the cracks. Extreme fans of sports cars might tolerate this game, but they'll have a difficult time saying that they actually ~like~ it, or even sort of generally feel neutral about it. I recommend a short three-hour rental, and that's it at best. For most racing fans, this one is worth skipping.", "date": "Apr 7, 1999"}
