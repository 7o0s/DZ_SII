Not only was the previous installment of ShootOut 989 Sports' most valuable asset in its entire 2002 lineup, it was also the beginning of a welcome introduction to some new ideas for the aging and often-criticized franchise (namely, the one-character career feature). After seeing the dramatic turnaround of NFL GameDay earlier this year, however, our expectations for NBA ShootOut 2004 grew even higher. If the company could make that big of a difference with its football game in the span of less than a year, imagine what it could do with its already-superior basketball series!   Sadly we'll just have to keep on imagining. As despite the fact that 989 has incorporated the always-welcome online feature and a couple of other beneficial additions, we can't help but notice that it still has a long way to go before it can truly compete with the big boys.   Features  To be just, NBA ShootOut 2004 doesn't fare too badly with its list of available options. In addition to its sizable online mode (detailed more thoroughly in its section below), the game also offers 50 of the greatest NBA players in history (or as the running joke in the office goes: 49 of the greatest players and someone else -- as Michael Jordan hasn't been included for contractual exclusivity reasons). Unlocked by performing special feats during your gameplay sessions (such as scoring 25 points, 5 blocks, and 12 rebounds as a center in a Laker game), the legends can prove to be pretty useful if you need an extra player or two to bolster your chances of whipping a buddy senseless.    Thankfully the list of legends is pretty impressive; even if Michael Jordan is conspicuous by his absence. Bob Cousy, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Bill Walton, Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing, James Worthy, Charles Barkley, Clyde Drexler, and dozens of other historical icons all make their appearances with the same play styles and fashion sense that they had when they were balling. And because of the way it's setup to unlock them, ShootOut has found an effective way of ensuring that players will experiment with more than just a couple of teams over the lifespan of their playing time -- as it's the only way to unlock each and every one of the legendary athletes.   Also new this year is the USB headset support that GameDay and GameBreaker first debuted back in August. Built on the exact same technology as those two footballers, the USB headset support allows online players to chat with each other in addition to calling specific plays for their CPU-controlled teammates. Simply press and hold the L1 button while speaking your pre-determined commands and your team does exactly what you want them to. It's far more useful in a speedy game like basketball than in GameDay, and since you're able to change offensive and defensive sets or commit fouls in this manner without ever having to cycle through menus, the potential for last second strategies has increased quite substantially.   Of course, the game's most impressive feature last season and the standout star once again is its stellar career mode. A much more personal twist on the typical franchise option, career mode allows players to create a single athlete and take him from the Summer Pro League and NBDL all the way to the NBA. To tailor your alter ego just right, however, you'll need to participate in off-day practices and exhibition games to improve your stats and abilities or your chances of signing a contract with a major team are slim to none. Because of its huge scope, this particular mode can potentially last all year long -- with hundreds upon hundreds of games to be played before it's finally finished. Truthfully, the increase in stats and quest for a contract will probably take most gamers far too long to pursue successfully; as it requires a major time investment and provides upgrades so incremental, that you'll need the patience of Rama-Navami to put up with it. Dedicated fans should love this approach and reward system for sure though -- but it comes recommended for them only.    Other notable features in NBA ShootOut 2004 include its expanded playbooks (with over 450 team-specific strategies) and augmented creation tools. Because of these inclusions, inclined gamers can toy around with a bevy of different crafting options such as the customizable playbook and play creation editor, create-a-player, and create-a-dunk construction sets. It should be distinguished, however, that as much as we appreciate the use of the game's many assembly utensils, its somewhat sloppy save system (it uses separate files for rosters, careers, and settings.) and poorly constructed menu setup make navigating some of these areas a real pain in the neck. Still; with ShootOut's nice array of included features, it's almost comparable with Sega and EA in terms of its game options -- which is always a good start.   Gameplay  Despite its long list of features, however, it's in the most important category where ShootOut ultimately falters. Though it's caught up with ESPN and NBA Live's idea of using the right analog stick to enhance your experience, it's implementation never quite achieves the fluidity or responsiveness of EA and Sega's Freestyle and IsoMotion configuration.   Used for blocking and stealing when on defense and special dribble techniques when playing offense, the new stick maneuverability feels far too mechanical and sluggish for its own good. It's still nowhere near as flashy as Live and can't match the realism of ESPN. Unless you feel particularly underwhelmed during the course of a contest, you'll have little reason to use the stick at all. Especially since the defensive maneuvers can be pulled off more intuitively with the face buttons anyway.    Thankfully ShootOut has managed to put together an acceptable basketball model that can still be a lot of fun if you give it the chance. Shooting percentages and team strategies especially follow realistic patterns and are more statistically accurate than any other B-Ball game on the market. And though the offensive and defensive formations available to the player are definitely limited when compared to its competition, they're useful enough to actually make a difference when you change them in the right situations.   Also in the game's favor is the multitude of upgrades that the team has made since last year's attempt at improvement: Mid-air shot changes have finally been incorporated after what seems like an eternity and the new player ratings reflect on characters much more accurately (speedier guys are actually fast and certain stars have unique signature maneuvers). Momentum physics have been taken into consideration during the run and gun too, and your opponent's A.I. is slightly more aggressive and strategic. To say that it's a more complete game than the 2003 edition would only be stating the obvious; but for fans of the previous installment, ShootOut 2004 should provide enough improvements to be noticed.   The most important factor that needs to be addressed in regards to these changes, however, is that Sega and Electronic Arts have already been using the majority of these features and additions in their games for years -- proving even more resolutely that ShootOut is obviously behind the times -- especially in how it handles defending your man. Heralded as one of the game's key new features, the post up option isn't as impressive as it should be.   Though players will be able to engage ball handlers from three different angles, the combination of canned animations and automatic positioning creates a bizarre invisible wall that stops players dead in their tracks -- regardless of their momentum. What this means is that even if you're barreling down the court at full speed, you'll be halted right where you stand the moment you come across your assigned defender. After stopping and transitioning into your post-up animation, you'll finally be able to move forward again -- pushing your opponent as you go. In short, it's not what it should be.    Online  We've already gone on record by saying that NFL GameDay has the best online model of any football game out there, and it appears that ShootOut may well have the same claim for basketball. Constructed using the now-established 989 Sports Online hub, ShootOut Online allows players to connect to the net with their buddies and wreak havoc all over the rubber. After a match is over, gamers can then check their stats on the Leaderboards, view their win/loss records, examine the rankings of other players from all over the country, and even setup tournaments for up to 64 other players. If it sounds familiar to you GameDay veterans it should: it's exactly the same type of deal.   Naturally that means that all of GameDay's other typical online components (like downloadable rosters, personal mailboxes, and basic message board systems) have been included as well, and the ability to track people's career progress was a nice touch added just for ShootOut.   There are other little tidbits to speak of too; like interactive polls and surveys, special promotional match-ups, and breaking news from the world of Sony Computer Entertainment. In terms of its popularity, however, the community is still in its early stages and isn't anywhere near the size of the Madden or Live on its servers.   Not surprisingly ShootOut has a couple of lag issues when compared to its companion NFL GameDay -- likely attributed to the fact that basketball is a faster moving and more improvisational sport by nature. And while previous lag standards (Live 2003 was the pinnacle of delayed reactions) weren't met or exceeded in the few sessions we competed in, it did prove to become an occasional hindrance now and again; though it's no more than what you'll find in ESPN or Live 2004. These issues aside, ShootOut is still more than playable online and will probably only disappoint the masses because of its limitation of two simultaneous players and its previously mentioned gameplay issues.     Graphics  Despite the fact that the developers have gone back and remodeled player geometry, improved the faces of its stars, and doubled the amount of animation, NBA ShootOut 2004 is still among the worst looking sports games this year. Washed out and under-detailed, the textures and environments don't have anywhere near the amount of color or vibrancy as ESPN NBA Basketball or NBA Live 2004. And it still gives off the impression that it's a couple of generations behind the opposition in the visuals department.   The lack of 16:9 and progressive scan support is a sore spot as well (especially since those options were included in 989's earlier football releases). And the mysterious invisible wall that we mentioned in the gameplay section makes the supposedly improved collision detection look as unrealistic as it did before. Once you add the unsteady framerate into the mix, you've officially got yourself some troubles.   To its credit, ShootOut does include some rather nifty camera angles and slow-mo replays that can be adjusted to suit any taste level, and the increased number of animations definitely make up for last year's robotic players. Regardless of these benefits, though, ShootOut has a long way to go before it can catch up to the competition in terms of ocular technology.   Sound  Encoded with Dolby Pro Logic I, NBA ShootOut definitely has its moments where the audio shines. Boasting licensed songs from Gift of Gab, Maroon, Hydraulic Funk, and Afrika Bambaataa, its soundtrack may not be as solid as that of its gridiron brother NFL GameDay, but at least it includes something other than canned studio music.    The play-by-play team of Bill Walton and Ian Eagle, however, is probably where the auditory presentation is at its best. Already proven to have one of the better commentary techniques with its earlier football games, 989 Sports continues that tradition with the crystal-clear and very accurate annotations of two knowledgeable broadcasters. Rarely behind on the calls and infrequent with its repeated speech patterns, the game's commentary is definitely top notch.   Strangely, the sound effects are often interrupted and silenced for unknown and unpredictable reasons. On more than a couple of occasions, the crowd, announcers, and ball bouncing went completely hushed for about 10-15 seconds with no explanation whatsoever -- the only ambient noise was that of screeching feet and the bell ring from your menu selections. If not for this moderately frequent glitch in the system, though, the sound is generally top-notch.Don't be fooled by the lower overall score when compared to ShootOut 2003; as ShootOut 2004 is a solid improvement over last year's edition by quite a large sum. It has, after all, made several profound leaps in terms of its presentation and play mechanics and still has one of the best online models and career modes that we've seen this year.What ShootOut doesn't have, however, is enough quality gameplay to compete with NBA Live and ESPN NBA Basketball. Granted, ShootOut has plenty of entertainment for gamers faithful enough to stick with the franchise for another year, but when placed against a PS2 sports division that keeps the type of company that it does, it just doesn't hold up in the long run", "date": "Oct 29, 2003"}
