This routine has made the character a cult classic in video games, and despite his AWOL Duke Nukem Forever status, interest in the big fella just doesn't seem to wane. This will probably be much to the benefit of Machineowrk's Duke Nukem Mobile 3D, a handset edition of the first-person shooter.   This week, I reviewed DOOM RPG, which is also based on a very famous FPS. However, understanding that most (if not all) handsets are ill-equipped to provide proper controls for the genre, opted to trade in the letters FPS for RPG without losing any of the franchise's allure. A piece of me wishes Machineworks has considered a similar approach, as control is really about the only thing you can slag on Duke Nukem Mobile 3D.   The game certainly looks great. This V CAST game (which I played on an LG VX8100) offers dozens upon dozen of polygonal aliens smothered in good (for mobile) texture work. The pigcops, for example, have gold lines running down their pant legs and defined tusks flanking their ugly snouts. And the screen can really fill up with these fellas. However, you only see the high detailed models when they are right next to you. The game shuffles low-detail models into play when enemies are further away. I was pleasantly surprised to see how populated some of the levels can get. The animations never seem to take a hit, and the framerates doesn't chug. This could be due in part to making the maps a little more open and throwing lower detail textures on the buildings. Since you're concentrating so much on the bad guys, you'll likely not notice nor care.   Duke Nukem Mobile 3D also makes good with several voice clips from the Duke. While some his more offensive comments have been excised from the game, he still has no problem letting you know exactly how he feels about a situation. (~Damn, I'm good!~) The background audio is also well done, including some appropriate butt-y butt rock.   Now, a word about those controls. Machineworks tries its best to overcome the deficiency of the handset for FPS games, assigning strafing runs to the number keys while you move around with the directional pad. It sorta works, but one of the hallmarks of the FPS is the freedome to aim and shoot everywhere. That just isn't present in Duke Nukem Mobile 3D -- you can't even change the angle at which you fire. This isn't a big deal necessarily as most of the action takes place on the same plane, but it is noticeable. Duke Nukem Mobile 3D does feature a double-tap feature that allows you to speedily glance at enemies has they swarm around you, and this is a decent solution I expect other mobile FPS games to pilfer.   There is no shortage of content in Duke Nukem Mobile 3D. With 21 levels that can be played on multiple difficulty settings, there is some real meat here. The game does not download all 21 levels at once, though. It downloads the levels in groups, which is an effective way of managing the game's memory footprint.  It's interesting to play Duke Nukem Mobile 3D right after DOOM RPG. DOOM RPG accepted the shortcomings of handsets and took a different approach while Duke Nukem Mobile 3D just steams ahead, trying to find workarounds for the controls issues inherent in mobile. Their attempts are reasonable solutions, although not perfect. As a result, I found myself occasionally frustrated by having to move, strafe, and shoot with both hands dancing as fast as they could.However, if you're ready to accept the control problems and move on, there is a lot to like in Duke Nukem Mobile 3D. The visuals are great, the audio clips are entertaining, and there are lots of levels. I'm curious to see what Machineworks can pull off when we finally get a next gen of phones with better controls (analog nub, please?).", "date": "Sep 21, 2005"}
