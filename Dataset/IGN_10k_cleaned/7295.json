To catapult out of the pack, Glu licensed two of the biggest names in the poker universe -- World Series of Poker and Chris Ferguson -- to headline its entry. But a couple of popular names alone doesn't guarantee success, just some early eyeballs. Fortunately, thanks to some guidance from the WSOP, Glu's well-crafted game of Texas Hold'em offers an authentic experience that should please mobile poker fans -- at least, those that don't already have one or two poker games already downloaded on their handsets.   WSOP offers all the trimmings of the license, from logo-emblazoned tables to the quest for the biggest currency in the WSOP circuit: bracelets. This aura of ~being there~ is a major plus, but the game backs it all up with a very solid game of cards. The official Texas Hold'em rules are employed when you sit down at the tables and take your cards from the digital dealer in any of three game modes: quick play, solo mode, and online.   The quick play feature is good for just a quick few hands when you don't have time to embark on an epic solo career, working your way up the WSOP ranks. In solo mode, you can either create your own identity or assume that of Ferguson and other poker luminaries. With a starting bankroll in the thousands, you sit down and play your way through a series of tournaments, earning those coveted bracelets that guarantee you a space at the biggest games. The solo play is good, with early tournaments offering plenty of AI-controlled players that make the appropriate mistakes. If you're not an amateur, the early rounds of solo play might be a little easy, though.   One of the best features of WSOP is the in-game advisor that offers guidance on your next play. Ferguson himself offers up tips from under the brim of his hat. How can you not trust advice from those flowing locks, especially one nicknamed ~Jesus?~ (Missed opportunity: Calling the poker advisor WWJD.) You aren't required to listen to this advice, as you never know what cards are coming next. Your crap hand could suddenly turn into three kings -- but that's what poker's all about, isn't it?   But even with the poker advisor, WSOP so far isn't offering much more than any of the other Texas Hold'em sims on the decks. Glu's ace is the online mode. (Available on Verizon.) If you're willing to sacrifice the airtime, you can wade online and play with other carbon-based life forms where the action is really unpredictable. Anybody that plays online poker on the PC knows how frustrating it can be to sit with a bunch of jackasses that foolishly go all-in on the lamest hands, hoping to either suck out or just disrupt the flow of the game. But that's what happens when real money isn't on the line. Even with the occasional bad player, there is still excitement in playing with other people.WSOP is definitely one of the better mobile poker games, especially due to the online play -- a feature shared by few competitors. The presentation is solid, the poker advisor seems mostly accurate, and I liked the use of real world locations to further the realism of this sim. The pacing can be a little slow when you are at a full table, so I suggest you make use of the 'skip ahead' feature to speed up play. (However, doing so may mean you miss gleaning some strategy from other players.) WSOP has an uphill battle to achieve dominance since the mobile poker scene is already quite saturated with some strong titles that have a similar feel, but the smart use of the WSOP license should definitely boost Glu's offering into the upper ranks.", "date": "Oct 2, 2006"}
