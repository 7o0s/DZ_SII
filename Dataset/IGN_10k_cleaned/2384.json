It's missing its soul.  Natsume brought a decent port of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 to the Game Boy Color last year, and it's disheartening to see that Palmer for the GBA has fewer levels and skaters.  Jazz without soul is just a bunch of tooting horns, and that's what Palmer is, just some tooting horns.  With only a few levels and riders to play with, Palmer manages to achieve a modest mediocrity.  Features Ride as one of four pro snowboarders Master four of the world's biggest snowboarding locales Link cable support for two-player challenges Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  Knock down a shot of tequila and head to the slopes with one of four real-life pro snowboarders.  Shaun Palmer, of course, is included and is the best of the pack.  The game plays similar to Tony Hawk with goals to complete in each level in order to open new levels and attain better boards.  You've got four unique areas in the game, four snowboarders, and four different boards for each.  Fortunately, there's more than four tricks.  Speaking of tricks, each rider can pull off about twenty different tricks.  That's grabs and grinds.  Not a bad number of tricks and they're all pretty easy to pull off.  The most complicated of tricks take only three taps of the D-Pad to pull off.  As with any good extreme sport title, combining tricks is the key to big points.  Pull off a Double Back Flip and land in a Nose 5-0 board slide, jump off the grind and pull a 720 Rocket Air for some serious snowboard scrilla.  There are three modes to choose from when you begin a career: Freestyle, Palmer X, and Superpipe.  Freestyle takes a lot from Hawk.  There are five tasks for each area, which include getting the Pro and Sick scores and collecting the letters S-H-R-E-D.  Unlike Hawk, you do not need to collect all five letters in one run.  If you did, it would be almost impossible.  It's easy to miss a letter and since you're headed downhill, you can't go back.  Most of the Freestyle tasks are pretty easy once you're used to the trick system.  With only five tasks, each Freestyle level can be finished rather quickly.  To add a bit of challenge, most of the levels offer a lot more than pleasant snowy trails to travel.  You'll need to skate through restaurants, across swimming pools, and over bottomless chasms.  There are plenty of places to get air and lots of objects to grind, now if only Natsume had brought the fun.    Palmer X is the racing portion of the game.  Pitted against three other racers, you'll have to navigate around slalom flags to become the first past the finish line.  This is no easy task.  Heck, this is no fair task.  No matter how well I did, I could not win a single race.  If I made it down the slope in 55 seconds, the other racers made it in 50 seconds.  If I made it in 50 seconds, they made it in 46 seconds.  Once, I was a game screen away from a first place finish and all three racers flew past me, leaving me choking on their powder.  The races are unbalanced and require no skill, just a knowledge of every single short cut.  There's no bonus for pulling off tricks during your run, so all you worry about is steering around obstacles and finding the shortcut and hoping the computer doesn't screw you over at the last moment.  Terrible.  When I was in college, Superpipe meant something else entirely.  Here, it refers to the halfpipe.  This is easily the best aspect of Palmer.  The halfpipe is nicely rendered and offers huge air to pull off some nice trick combos.  As you make your way down the halfpipe, bonuses will pass by, floating above the halfpipe.  Time your jumps right and you can add an extra 1000 points to your trick combo.  Superpipe succeeds where the rest of Palmer fails, offering enjoyment and the chance to rip it and have fun.  A multiplayer option should be the standard for GBA games.  Palmer does its job providing a fun, but limited, multiplayer mode.  Link up with a buddy to battle for the most points in Superpipe mode.  You can only link with one other person and there's no multiplayer racing.  The multiplayer mode is an obvious afterthought.  It's nice to have, but once you've played it a few times, you won't be coming back.  There's just not a lot there, and that's a shame.    And now time for the big gripe.  Palmer uses a password save.  Don't get me wrong, some games work fine with a password save, but this is not one of those games.  Every time you finish a task in career mode, you get a new thirteen-digit password to jot down.  Every time you get a SHRED letter in Freestyle mode, you got a new password to scribble on your arm.  With four boarders, there are quite a lot of tasks to pass to complete the entire game.  That adds up to a ridiculous amount of long passwords.  Activision included a battery save in Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX so there's no reason there shouldn't be one here.  With the exception of the Superpipe, Palmer isn't much to look at.  The snow is repetitive, in fact every environment feels repetitive.  Though Palmer is advertised as having ~free-roaming~ environments, that's not really true.  There are side-barriers you cannot get passed.  The idea that the areas are vast is bogus.  Sure, the Freestyle levels are long (as opposed to wide), but you can see it all in just a few runs.  The level-design is average at best.  The rider animations are short and without flare.  You never feel like you are pulling off specific tricks (except for back flips), so it never really gets exciting.  The Superpipe is really nice.  The animations are much clearer in the Superpipe and you get a real sense of what you tricks you are pulling off.  Had Natsume chosen to make the boarders bigger in the other modes, perhaps the game would have more flavor.  As is, the graphics never leave a lasting impression.If you're gonna be THPS, then be it... don't go halfway.  Palmer offers far fewer levels and riders than any of Activision's other handheld extreme sports titles.  It plays like it wasn't made with much care.  Sometimes a company focuses solely on the technical aspects of a game.  They just want to get it out there without any major bugs.  What's sacrificed is the very soul of the game.  No thought is put into making the game innovative or fun, they just want it finished.  Palmer isn't a terrible game.  It's like a kid at a piano recital.  All the necessary notes are played, but no life is put into the music.  It plays flat.  And who wants that?", "date": "Dec 14, 2001"}
