In fact, it's probably better you don't read it because there'll be no sugar coating for the sake of nostalgia here. No, this review is for the legions of Wii owners out there who are desperately waiting for another game to come along that's worth their hard-earned cash. The handful of titles they own have been played to death, and now they're twiddling their Wii-motes waiting for something new and compelling. Will this game be it?   Well, at first glance I could see how you'd be swayed. I mean, even if you're not a Mortal Kombat fan, the allure of a 64 character line-up is pretty strong, and there are a number of modes to get stuck into, from Arcade and Konquest through to the super-deformed kart racer Motor Kombat, not to mention a robust character creation mode that lets you set everything from basic moves and boob size through to fighting style. Plus, it's a fighting game with gesture controls! Imagine how intuitive it should be to pounce on an opponent or cast a fireball, all with a flick of the wrist!   Unfortunately, Mortal Kombat: Armageddon is fatally flawed, and a large slice of our accusatory finger pointing is leveled firmly at a specter that often haunts the Wii - The Ghost of Shoehorned Controls. Simply put, the control mapping is fundamentally uncomfortable, and the gesture system is inconsistent at best.   Is anyone else getting sick of being told to fasten the Wrist Strap every single time you want to play a game on Wii? Patronising much?  Here's how the controls work. The game utilises both the Wii-mote and the Nunchuk, with the analogue stick on the Nunchuk used for character movement, while the Z button is used to block and the C button is used to change fighting style. So far so good. It's on the Wii-mote that everything starts going pear shaped. The B button plus a movement is used for gesture-based moves, while the A button is used for throws and the D-PAD is used for standard attacks. It's worth hitting you with some more caps just to underline how bad an idea this is. THE D-PAD IS USED AS FOUR BUTTONS FOR BASIC ATTACKS. Amazing. Not only is this an incredibly unwieldy way to fight, it's next to impossible once you factor in the gestures. Unless you're some kind of hand contortionist, there is simply no way that you can comfortably keep a finger on the B button at the same time as leaving your thumb hovering over the D-pad. It just doesn't work.   And yet this is fundamental to the gameplay. You can't just ignore the basic moves in favour of grabs and gesture specials, any more than you can ignore the gesture specials in favour of the weak-sauce basic combos. To be honest, we're baffled as to why this project went ahead as is. We all know the Wii-mote has a deficit of buttons, and just holding the controller reveals how uncomfortable this control scheme is, so what's the story? Sure, you can input specials the old-fashioned way by using a GCN controller or the classic controller but that negates the one bonus element that this game has going for it over the versions that were released last year. And for those newcomers to Nintendo, for whom the Wii is their first console, it means either laying out extra cash for a GameCube-style controller or struggling with unwieldy controls.    Still, there's the distinct possibility that after sampling how random the gesture implementation is in this game, you won't think dropping the gesture system is too great a loss. Put simply, a fighting game needs the player to be able to rely on its moves for it to be fun. If, for example, you only threw a fireball every second time you did a quarter circle forward and hit a punch button in Streeties, it would become an exercise in frustration as opposed to a finely-tuned dance of death. Same deal here, and for the life of us we just couldn't get the specials happening consistently. The movements are all pretty straightforward, consisting of half circles or forward/back, up/down style motions, but for the most part the outcome of our movements were something of a lottery. Sometimes nothing happened, sometimes our fighter trotted out the wrong move, and sometimes - joy - the system worked as it should. And when it does work it feels pretty cool, but there's no way anyone could consider MKA's gesture-based specials a success.   There's only one thing cooler than a flip kick. A flaming flip kick.  So. A few hours into the game we switched over to a Wavebird GameCube controller. And suddenly Mortal Kombat: Armageddon became a whole lot more fun. Sure, the combat mechanics are positively medieval compared to the leading lights of the fighting genre, and sure, the 64 characters are woefully uninspired in design, but there's still something to be said for this game's unbalanced, mash-happy, fast-paced combat. Players can switch between a hand-to-hand stance and a weapon stance (down from three stances in the previous game), which allows you to switch play up a little, while the range of moves on offer are as gory and hilarious as ever. In fact, that's the one thing that Mortal Kombat does better than other fighters - the balance between over-the-top gore and tongue-in-cheek humour. Fatalities are also back, of course, but this time in the guise of the 'Kreate-A-Fatality' system. This allows the player to string together hits instead of memorising a particular combo, and while it feels a little watered down, it's also more straightforward for MK virgins to get into.    The core gameplay - even after jettisoning the Wii-mote - may not be all that inspired, but Midway has thrown in a couple of bonus modes to keep things varied. MK fans would be familiar with Konquest from previous games, but for the uninitiated, this mode is basically a roaming collect-em-up fighter. And when I say 'roaming', I mean 'moving down a narrow path that may or may not contain spinning blades to avoid, which opens up into an arena or room where you fight some guys before moving on'. And when I say 'collect-em-up', I mean loot drops like you wouldn't believe. Every few feet there are 'koins' to collect, items to pick up and treasure chests to kick open. It's all strung together with a basic plot that doesn't take itself too seriously, and indeed, it's the very disposability of the mode that makes it such a guilty pleasure. There's nothing deep about going ape crazy bonkers on a roomful of identikit enemies with a light saber, nor is there much skill required in juggling a bad guy before impaling him on an icy stalagmite, or unleashing the flashy special moves that you unlock as you play, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun. Plus, the more koins you collect the more clothes and special moves you'll be able to buy for your Kreate-A-Fighter character, and the more content you'll be able to buy in the absolutely massive Krypt.   Motor Kombat really is as exciting as it looks in this screen. You can't tell but my hair is totally blown back from the sheer thrill of it.  In fact, it's the wealth of bonus content that will be one of the biggest draws for old school MK fans, but will newcomers to the series care about whether they've collected all the trinkets (such as Baraka's blade and a photo of Cage)? Will they want to unlock beta test blooper movies, photos of the dev team, vast archives of artwork and bonus costumes? Probably not, but it's still cool that it's included. The same cannot be said for the other bonus mode, Motor Kombat. While we understand that it's only meant to be a bit of fun, this kart racing game with its super-deformed MK characters is pretty piss-poor. Best to ignore it really.  Its really hard to recommend Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, regardless of whether youre a hardcore fan or a newcomer to the series. Its passable in most areas, but excels in very few. The visuals for instance, are reasonable but unremarkable, while the combat mechanics are fun but clunky and the character line-up is massive but creatively barren. The strongest elements are probably the wealth of unlockable content, the character creation suite and the surprisingly addictive Konquest adventure mode  all of which are already available for PS2 and Xbox owners. In terms of Wii-specific content, MKA fares poorly. Online play has been exorcised, while the Wii-mote/Nunchuk control scheme is basically an uncomfortable failure. If youre looking for a great fighting game on Wii, you may have to be patient just a little bit longer.", "date": "Jun 13, 2007"}
