Originally birthed in 1986 on the MSX home computer system, the Konami-developed Vampire Killer was an overwhelming success in both European and Japanese markets. Heralded for its state of the art graphics and undeniable level of difficulty, the game spawned an immediate remake on the Nintendo Entertainment System and was soon followed by several booming sequels on multiple platforms. In just a matter of years the upstart franchise had established itself as one of the premiere legacies in the entire industry, and had turned the words ~Belmont~ and ~Castlevania~ into household phrases.This dominance continued far into the 1990s as well; as Castlevania embraced and excelled on the 16- and 32-bit platforms. In 1997 the series hit its peak with its tale of Alucard and Richter known to Saturn and PlayStation fans as Symphony of the Night. Considered by many to be one of the industry's true masterpieces, Symphony of the Night is still recognized today as one of the best videogames ever; and has the distinction of being acknowledged as the world's last great 2D actioner. It appeared as though the Castlevania series was the embodiment of all things positive in the 2D realm.But then Konami decided to move the Belmonts (or should we say the Schneider's and Fernandez's?) into the third dimension. Often described as ~that failed 3D experiment,~ the pair of Nintendo 64 adventures from Konami's now-defunct Kobe studio received quite a lukewarm response. Criticized for their abundance of technical problems, delayed controller reactions, and a mess of camera issues, Castlevania 64 and Legacy of Darkness seemed to dash any hope for the franchise's aspirations to grow beyond its two-dimensional persona. And with no plans to bring further 2D escapades to future consoles, it seemed that Castlevania was resigned to a prosperous life exclusively on Game Boy Advance.Strategy Guide Available!

Renowned Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow Producer Koji Igarashi had decided to move the world of Castlevania beyond its place in the handheld market and back to its position for consoles. Determined to capture the essence of what made the 2D classics and current pocket versions so compelling, Igarashi made it clear from the beginning that he wanted to resurrect the staples of Vampire Killer which made it a success in the first place. Resolute in his decision to combine these elements with contemporary 3D technology (and remembering the lessons learned by his Kobe colleagues), Igarashi assembled an award winning team of creators to bring the series back to its former greatness.With that, the stage for Castlevania: Lament of Innocence was finally set. And the squad at Konami Tokyo began its big-time promises of infusing classic whip-snapping action and modern-day production values. Secretly in assemblage for quite some time before being officially announced earlier this year, Lament of Innocence is finally finished and ready to invade a PS2 near you. But will this latest attempt at a 3D Belmont truly erase the memory of the franchise's obvious low point? Have Igarashi and friends managed to encapsulate all the fantastic things that made the previous titles so enjoyable? And will fanatics dedicated to the Castlevania namesake be satisfied enough to give the third-dimension a second chance after all? In a word: absolutely.  StoryThrowing away the idea that Sonia Belmont first began the Castlevania timeline, Lament of Innocence marks the true beginnings of the Belmont clan. Borrowing a couple of ideas from Bram Stoker's Dracula, the PS2 version of Castlevania begins deep in the 11th century; following the exploits of one Leon Belmont -- A renowned knight and respected noble. Part of an elite throng of warriors entrusted with protecting his kingdom, Leon is considered to be the most courageous and powerful of all the troupe's combatants: Equaled only perhaps by his best friend and trusted strategist Mathias Cronquist. Needless to say, the pair and their team are considered to be nigh invincible and are often called away to fight in sorties to protect the land in the name of God.After returning home from their latest success, however, Mathias and Leon are shocked to find out that Cronquist's wife Elizabetha has suddenly died from unknown causes. So fraught with grief and sorrow is Mathias that he is stricken sick and becomes bedridden almost immediately. Around the same time, a bizarre army of hideous monsters invades the kingdom and begins to slaughter its citizens. Unfortunately for Leon and his soldiers they are forbidden from engaging in battles with these types of creatures as long as the king's crusades are taking place. Because of this declaration by the crown and the church, the hordes of darkness remain unchecked while the king's forces remain far in the east. Life is not good.    Just when it appears that the situation can't get any worse, Leon's  fiance Sara is mysteriously kidnapped. A few evenings later, Mathias Cronquist struggles from his sickbed to tell Leon that he knows where Sara is -- in a castle mastered by a great vampire within the forest of Eternal Night. Forbidden to rescue her because of his position, Leon renounces his title so that he may go to her; resolved to defeat this evil army, slay the vampiric menace, and save his woman from their clutches. And thus begins the story to Lament of Innocence.Amazingly enough, the diatribe above is covered and explained within the first few minutes of the introductory cinematic. Much heavier in terms of the storyline in comparison to past Castlevanias, Lament of Innocence does a pretty solid job of moving the plot forward without inundating the pace with constant dialogue (like Devil May Cry). The most appreciated aspect of the storyline, though, is that it finally explains a lot of the franchise's videogame gimmicks in a realistic way: Ever wonder why there are random weapons strewn throughout every level? It's because vampire hunters who were there before you left them behind when they were killed. Curious as to why there are power-ups and other such goodies located in hidden and strategic places? It's because the vampire master likes to make a sport of the hunter/undead confrontations. Sometimes the little things like this can go a long way.GameplayThere have been quite a few associations made during the preview process by various gaming magazines comparing Castlevania and 2002's Rygar. Now for those of you that were lucky enough to have played The Legendary Adventure, it's true that Lament of Innocence evokes some distinct feelings of familiarity. Shown from the third-person perspective, your hero Leon is capable of several different maneuvers comparable to those found in Tecmo's popular offering.  As your playing time increases, however, the depth of your character's repertoire is increased quite substantially -- eventually dwarfing the commands available in Rygar by a sizeable margin. After a couple of hours of playing time, the differences between the two games are readily apparent and any similarity between the two should be noted as nothing more than a surface relationship.Initially Leon is equipped with a basic but effective whip of alchemy and a limited number of moves. Square and Triangle work as the weak and strong attacks, respectively, while X is the familiar jump button. The circle key intuitively activates your sub-weapon while R1 raises Leon's enchanted gauntlet for blocking and magic absorption purposes. Press the two aforementioned buttons together, however, and you can activate a magic spell for battle against more difficult enemies; while holding down R1 and X together enables your character to do quick steps and evasive maneuvers.This setup is no doubt one of the game's most important (and impressive) aspects and provides for some of the most responsive three-dimensional exploration we've experienced in awhile. Needless to say, your character moves and reacts much better in this 3D space than his N64 counterparts all those years ago.Battling enemies in the beginning is a little on the easy side, as basic alternating combinations and three-hit strong attacks make due of your early foes rather quickly. An hour or so into the game, however, and the difficulty amps up quite a bit; presenting Leon with a list of enemies than need special techniques or magic to defeat them. In a clever bit of balancing, most of these attacks and techniques are not available in the early going of the game at all and will only become unlocked when you've explored more of the castle, found certain rooms, or defeated a predetermined number of enemies.It's a much fresher approach to the typical RPG type level-up system found in more recent Castlevania titles and manages to accomplish three important goals at the same time: 1.) It keeps your character from leveling up and growing to powerful too quickly; 2.) It ensures that regardless of how strong your character gets you'll always continue to utilize your player skills to succeed; and 3.) It provides a legitimate reason for needing to explore the castle grounds.There are other types of upgrades besides combos and techniques that can be earned as well, which can primarily be found for sale at Renaldo's alchemy shop or in hidden areas of the castle. These upgrades can include items such as armor plated chest mail, specially powered magical capes, relics for casting spells, or the famous HP/MP/Heart Containers to raise attributes. To the game's credit, its handling of this secondary upgrade system is just as balanced as the first, with a rare item percentage that's truly rare and a list of equipment that's never ridiculously powerful. The designers have given merit to the idea that these extras are enhancements, not enablers.    The final type of upgrades, obtained through a slew of different colored orbs, takes its cue from the power-up system found in the GBA's Harmony of Dissonance. Only recovered after clearing one of the main environments, these orbs give an additional power to an existing sub-weapon. So while your secondary axe may kick a lot of ass on its own, pairing it up with the yellow orb will give you what's called the ~Sprint Ripper.~ A devastating special attack that can clear out the room with ease and grace. The trade-off, of course, is that will cost you a lot of hearts to perform it.When taken together, all these different elements make for one very interesting and very playable videogame. In fact, it's as close to feeling like a 2D game in a 3D world that you can get. Used in conjunction with the semi-automatic targeting system (a system that actually allows you to hit the enemy you want to) and a nice variety of enemy creatures, Lament of Innocence more than meets our expectations. And though the artificial intelligence may not inspire a movie with Matthew Broderick or Ally Sheedy, its relentless pacing and diverse number of strategies will probably kick your butt on more than a few occasions. The excellently designed environments and perplexing-but-not-frustrating puzzles are enjoyable too, making this every bit the game that Castlevania 64 should have been in the first place.But even the best games have their caveats, however, and Lament of Innocence is no exception. Enjoyable as it is, there are two minor complaints that hold this one back from truly reaching the stratosphere. The most noticeable of which is the problem with the camera during the platforming bits. Despite the fact that platforming itself is only needed in about 5-10% of the entire game, the strangely positioned camera can create some legitimate depth perception problems -- forcing gamers to go back and retry the same jump over and over again; a jump that would probably have been a piece of cake in a two-dimensional setting. The camera can also run into problems if you make too many vertical jumps in a row -- oftentimes not being able to keep up with you if you move to fast.  Castlevania's other hitch is that it may be a little too big for its own good. While we think it's cool that you need to revisit most areas a second or third time in order to get everything, there's a ton of transitional hallways that do nothing more than serve as empty pathways from one populated room to the next. While we'll be the first to admit that breather rooms like these are definitely necessary and important to survival, there comes a point when you have to cut down on them. It's not uncommon to move through several rooms in a row with nothing to do (which affects the pacing of the game a little negatively), and it gave us the impression that that Lament of Innocence is really 15-20 rooms too big. Of course, the otherwise brilliant stage design and compelling gameplay elements more than makes up for these bothers in the long run.GraphicsKonami has a talent for getting the most out of the PlayStation 2 hardware, and Castlevania's level of graphical quality only continues to prove it. Though it's not on the same level as other visual heavyweights like Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner or even Dark Cloud 2, Lament of Innocence more than holds its own against contemporary genre mates like Devil May Cry and Rygar. In fact, it looks better than both of those.Among the more impressive features that the engine boasts are the environments themselves: They're absolutely enormous and use an abundance of detailed textures and objects in each and every room. While it's true that there's a fair number of repeated textures and washed out maps in floors and ceilings, the artists have still undeniably captured the look and feel of an 11th century gothic castle. The spectacular lighting effects alone are definitely worth the price of admission and the number of enemies and special effects on-screen at the same time shows little to no slowdown whatsoever.We only wish that the camera issue we mentioned earlier (experienced while jumping) wasn't such an obvious sore spot. While we can't say that the system would have worked better as a user-controlled cam a la Mario 64 or from a top-down perspective like Frogger (yeah, we said Frogger), we can say that it could have definitely been improved upon. The dynamic smart-cam used in all other situations work fine, however, and are shouldn't provide for too many problems at all.   SoundLet's just say right off the bat that Michiru Yamane still has what it takes. One of the few female composers from Japan that incurs as much respect as her male counterparts Uematsu, Sakimoto, and Mitsuda, Yamane's grasp of the Castlevania world is unparalleled. She's the same musician responsible for the scores of Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow, and Castlevania Bloodlines, and has gone back to her roots to write the soundtrack for Lament of Innocence. The results are extraordinary.Teetering back and forth between pipe-heavy arias and piano solos to industrial-sounding rock music and dance beats, Castlevania's soundtrack is one of the best we've heard this year. Diverse yet strangely tied together, each of the game's environments serve as the inspiration for different moods and feelings with all the right melodies in all the right places. From a technical standpoint, it's less varied in terms of emotion when compared to Yamane's previous work on Symphony of the Night. But it's more melancholy demeanor and fitting transitions allow it to be just as poignant if not more touching.The sound effects don't inspire nearly as much raving as the music, but the classic sounds of the Belmont whip and remixed moans of the undead definitely get the job done. And for fans who prefer Japanese language tracks to the English sort, you'll be happy to know that the decision to switch between the two has been included in the options menu. As an added bonus, you can hook Lament of Innocence up to your best receiver and enjoy it in Dolby Pro Logic II as well; finishing off what's can only be described as terrific sound treatment.There was a whole lot of fan-oriented uproar when it was announced that the PlayStation 2 version of Castlevania would go way of the third dimension. And after playing the slightly average Nintendo 64 3D offerings a couple of years back, we can't say that we blamed them. Having experienced Konami's latest trip to the dark side for innumerable hours upon hours, however, we can safely confirm that ~Dracula's 3D Curse~ has finally been lifted.As despite the noticeable platforming problems and occasional exploratory moments that left us with nothing to do, Lament of Innocence still provides plenty of old-fashioned gothic entertainment. Successfully capturing the genius of what made its 2D predecessors so enthralling, this latest Castlevania should keep you busy for weeks.And while it can definitely be beaten the first time through in less than eight to 10 hours, its plethora of hidden goodies, unlockable playable characters, and incredible Halloween-like atmosphere should give fans more than enough reasons to go back. But more than anything else, it's just plain fun -- a trait that's always welcome in the videogame world.", "date": "Oct 21, 2003"}
