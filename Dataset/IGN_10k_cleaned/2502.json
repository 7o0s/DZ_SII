Something that looks and sounds this utterly bizarre is deserving of support, regardless of whether it plays worth a damn or not.  After all, just the first level pits the multi-colored guitar superhero against a diaper-wearing demon on a gigantic toy train wielding a battle-axe.  Plus a shark-toothed orange robot dog serving as the cheering section.  And at this point, we're still some distance away from the massive grinning lightning-striking people-eating keyboard UFOs.  If that doesn't start your game-geek blood moving, try and get more iron in your diet.  Like any rhythm action game, Gitaroo-Man may not necessarily have the legs to carry it if its aesthetic qualities don't appeal to you.  I recognize that some could find the music grating and the visuals unimpressive, and since it's my job to hold up some kind of pretense of objectivity, I won't go on at length about how said some ought to be nailed up on telephone poles and jeered at by passers-by.  But if the media attached hereunto even grabs you in the slightest, at least give this a rental, because it deserves to be appreciated, if only for a little while.  Gameplay  Gitaroo-Man places you in the role of U-1, teenage gimp by day and Gitaroo-Man by whenever strange musical supervillains threaten to cramp his style, which is unfortunately rather often.  When danger threatens, his faithful dog Puma tosses him his stylized sci-fi Gibson Explorer, and he transforms into the electric Kool-Aid acid hero of legend.  And then...it's time to tap buttons!  Well, it's a rhythm game.  What did you expect, after all?  Gitaroo-Man also throws the analog sticks into the mix, though, making for something a little more complicated than the straightforward action of Parappa.  The game focuses your attention on the center of the screen, where a long and meandering line moves through a central point.  When sections of that line are highlighted, that's a signal to press and hold the X button.  To keep on track, though, you also have to keep the left analog stick aimed in the direction of the line -- otherwise, U-1 falls out of the appropriate rockin' pose and fails to hit the bad guys with his barrage of power-chord destruction.  That fills up the majority of gameplay sequences, and it's far trickier than you might think once the game throws in complex chord cadences and waving lines.  During battle sequences, following the line also alternates with simple Parappa button-tapping, with quick breaks between the two systems to keep you on your toes.  The correspondence between inputs and musical response is remarkably good -- you can hear how landing a chord properly affects the music, and shifts in the line's direction neatly reflect changes in the melody.  Will you get tired of this?  It's your question to answer, honestly, but I don't find it half as dull as something like Parappa or Bust-a-Move.  The blend of the analog stick and button controls is a unique change of pace, and the difficulty level is tuned to prevent you from breezing through too quickly (unlike Parappa).  It's also interesting to find a game that demands attention to cues in both the music and visuals.  In many rhythm games, you can get away with just following the indicators on the screen, but the timing in Gitaroo-man is sufficiently persnickety that paying attention to the beat and melody is a requirement for success.  Graphics  No, this is not your typical Koei game.  Gitaroo-Man is drawn in a deranged cartoon style by developer 326, with simple lines, massive heads, ridiculously overexaggerated epically strange boss creations, and all of it translated quite nicely to 3D.  Some of the models and textures are a little rough, but the style works to comic effect even when it isn't the epitome of technological achievement.  The game still manages to impress most of the time, anyway, with a perfect framerate, cool guitar-lightning zap effects, and the occasional effectively translucent image, like the crystalline keyboard UFOs from level 2.  Hell, why even pick nits about the graphics of a game with crystalline keyboard UFOs?  Or Satan in a diaper?  Or something called Mojo King Bee, hanging out in the swamp with a bunch of frogs, bats, and a disco ball hanging from a cypress tree?  This is High Weirdness.  You require it without delay.  And you should battle through every level as soon as possible, in order to unlock the keen art galleries in the Collection mode.  Sound  That goes for the music as well, which spans genres from metal to electronica to funk, albeit filtered through the same kind of slightly feedbacky guitar sound almost every time (Gitaroo-Man's signature style, I suppose).  Yes, it's bizarre, but it's good to expand one's tastes now and again, and the execution is certainly on, with well-played tunes matched to harmonizing visual themes.  As mentioned before, there's substantial synchronization between how well you play and how good the music sounds -- a strong performance by the player equals an abundance of heavy guitar licks from our hero.  A nod in the direction of Koei's localization is necessary as well.  This is a story-driven game, even if the story is utter nonsense, and it's carried well enough by the character voices.  It was probably a little easier to act all this over-the-top wackiness than the dead-serious drama of Kessen II.  In particular, the entire office loves the sultry moan of ~Gitaroo-Man!~ that accompanies the start of every level.  Hey, maybe someone at Koei has her phone number...Gitaroo-Man, sadly, has ~niche~ written all over it, but everyone reading this had ought to do their very best to make that niche as large as possible.  A niche is too small to hold a game like this -- it has a huge variety of rocking music, fascinating graphics, and an original gameplay system that manages to hold up surprisingly well in comparison to the monotonous rhythm competition.Put it this way -- the world deserves Gitaroo-Man Two.
