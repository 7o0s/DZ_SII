Sheep are useful in a wide variety of ways, they can be counted as an aid in falling asleep, their wool can be woven into warm garments, and they can provide companionship to certain lonely IGN editors. It is no wonder that these simple minded little animals have ventured beyond the petting zoo and into the realm of videogames. Developed by those wacky folks at Capcom, Sheep is an odd little herding game where the player experiences what it is like to be an aspiring sheepdog.  Features  Sheep herding action Utilize items to keep sheep under control Four different worlds to herd your sheep through Three game save slots Arrange mode offers gained experience points and abilities through skillful play Choose from different sheepdogs with different abilities Unlockable sheepdogs (and sheep pig)   Gameplay It is hard to classify Sheep into one clear genre. It has puzzle elements, and strategy elements but they are very simplistic and reflex-intensive. The player controls the sheepdog around an obstacle course, directing the sheep towards bonus items like stars while avoiding deadly objects. The gameplay style is reminiscent of the classic Lemmings series where the player must watch over the absent minded creatures and help them along their path to salvation. The Lemmings games were more complex in that certain lemmings had specialized skills that had to be utilized to traverse levels. In Sheep, the player's fluffy companions have a limited set of abilities that usually only requires chasing them towards a switch, button, or bonus item.  Players may be mislead by the apparent ease of the game while playing through the first few training courses. These beginning courses are only to convey the gist of the gameplay, and are so simple the player may wonder if they are overlooking some other task. Each course plays out the same; safely herd the sheep through the course within the given time limit. The player is allowed a lost sheep or two, but there is a minimum number of sheep they must complete the course with in order to advance to the next course. Players will understand the inevitability of a few poor sheep haplessly running into the conveyer belt wood chipper in the later levels.   As the sheepdog, players must control the sheep by chasing them down and barking them in the correct direction. Sheep usually run in the opposite direction of the sheepdog, but also commonly stray from the herd. The player has the ability to pick up a sheep or two (stronger dogs can carry two at a time), and toss them back into the herd or out of harms way. The A button is designated as the action button (grabbing sheep, opening doors, flipping switches), and the B button will make the player's dog bark at the sheep, or use items. Barking at the sheep will cause them to sprint away from the player's dog, useful in the case of impending danger or just keeping those walking sweaters in check. Helpful items such as candy and boom boxes can be found in certain areas, and are a frustration relieving addition to the game. Candy can be placed on the ground and causes the sheep to flock to its location, and the ever-useful boom box causes the sheep to hypnotically follow the sheepdog wherever it goes.  There are four different types of sheep that the player can choose to enter a course with. These unique types of sheep have varying personality traits and difficulty levels. First there is the ~normal~ type of sheep; they are the easiest to control but are the least expensive, which makes them ideal for difficult stages, but yield the least amount of points. Second are the ~gentle~ sheep, which are a small notch up from ~normal~ sheep in terms of difficulty and price. ~Rock~ sheep are wild and stubborn, and therefore require a firm and skillful sheepdog to show them who's the boss. Finally there are the ~cool~ sheep, which if not for their rarity and high point value, players might enjoy watching them explode as they run into electric fences. ~Cool~ sheep are very difficult to control and are bound to frustrate the player.      The gameplay of Sheep is fun, but a little too simple compared to the aforementioned Lemmings. It is also a little too frustrating at times, which might make players lose interest and look for something else to play. The Arrange mode was a nice addition to the game and helps with the replay value. This mode increases the strategy of the game in that players must keep track of the experience level of the sheep and sheepdog. If the level of the sheep is higher than that of the dogs, then unruly sheep will plague the player. This also creates a more satisfying gameplay experience by instantly gratifying the player with level-ups, other than the normal mode's mundane high score driven play.  Graphics Sheep does not push the power of the GBA. While level designs are good, the sprites are a little too small and difficult to make out. Minor changes in animation convey different actions, as in the crouched posture of the dog as it creeps stealthily close to the sheep. Some animations are a little hard to recognize. For example, in the case of an immobilized sheep the player may wonder what is wrong, but after straining your eyes to look closer it appears the sheep has fallen and is stuck on its back requiring the player to pick it up and toss it back on its feet.  There is a little bit of slowdown at times when there are many sheep on screen at once in conjunction with course animations. Luckily, slowdown is not very common and doesn't hamper the player. The artists have done a good job at creating some excruciatingly cute characters, which can be seen in the sheep theater (where the simple story of each new level plays out in a little cut scene.). It is a little creepy and funny to witness the numerous different death traps that Capcom has included for its cute creations. From tractors to electric fences to evil cows to weird slicing and dicing machines the players sheep are sure to go out with a bang.   When it comes to Sheep's graphics, don't expect to be blown away. But for the type of game it is and the system its on, it gets the job done.  Sound The sound design in Sheep is good for the most part. Sound effects consist of simple barks and ~baas~ that you would expect to hear at the farm (or Craig's bedroom). That said, the baaing sheep do become a little annoying after a while. Sheep's soundtrack is full of catchy, lighthearted pieces that liven the task of chasing sheep. A few extra tunes would have made a positive addition to the game as the same music plays for each sub-course and only changes when you progress to a different world.   The so-so music design of the game doesn't hurt the overall Sheep experience, as it is not an audio intensive game. And who blares their GBA games at full decibel in public anyway? Sheep is a worthy addition to those of you who value strangely addictive puzzle/strategy games. It offers enough humor (slightly twisted humor), to garner a chuckle from time to time. Sheep falls into an awkward place among the portable gaming devices of today. As a cell phone offering, Sheep would have been extraordinary, but as a full-fledged GBA title it feels a little too shallow. In other words, Sheep is perfect to play while waiting around at the DMV, but your gaming time at home would be better dedicated to other titles.", "date": "Jul 10, 2003"}
