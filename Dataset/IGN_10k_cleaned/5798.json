{"name": "ER", "name_review": "ER", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/09/er", "text": "I never watched much of ER -- a smattering of episodes here and there, vague familiarity with the principal cast members, that sort of thing -- but thankfully, knowledge of the show isn't required to enjoy the game. And despite the fact that this was released as a budget title, it has a truly amazing amount of voice acting from Noah Wyle, Mekhi Phifer, Sherry Stringfield, and a few supporting cast members, all with their likenesses. I was pretty impressed by how much voice work these guys put into the game, and it really helps you get into the role of an intern rising the ranks in a busy and sometimes colorful hospital. The game also looks surprisingly good and could pass for a major release, but for a few missing pieces of the puzzle.   Although the packaging name checks and suggest strong similarities to the The Sims, the connection is mostly cosmetic. You have a few meters for hygiene, energy and composure, it's an isometric 3D engine, and you develop relationships with the staff using a Sims-like communication method. Unfortunately, comparing yourself to one of the most popular PC games ever can have the side effect of reminding the player of everything they liked about The Sims, instead of what ER brings to the table.   First of all, character creation is relatively basic. You choose ethnicity, gender, skin tone, eye color, hair color, and scrubs color, but it doesn't really affect how you play the game much, since you'll be zoomed out all the way most of the time. With a maximum resolution of 1024x768, you'll find yourself wanting to see more of the playing field, particularly when you're charged with tracking down someone who's running all over the place.   The camera controls are also an odd disappointment. In order to rotate your view, you have to hover your mouse over the lower left-hand or right-hand part of the screen, instead of steering the camera with the mouse itself, which is standard behavior for isometric 3D at this point.   You'll get the hang of it eventually, though, and the pace of the game is never too fast to make it frustrating, but it's still an unnecessary learning curve. Once you've leaped that hurdle, you have all kinds of things to keep you busy.     Over the course of the game, you can develop those Sims-like relationships, which will give your medical skills a small bonus when those people are within your character's radius of influence. Conversely, people you don't get along with will lower your skills. It's an interesting psychological twist. The problem is that I didn't care one way or the other how my colleagues felt about me, and not getting to know anyone didn't appear to have any significant affect on gameplay.   Whether this was an intential aspect of design to invite a little role playing or an underpowered element of the game is probably up for grabs, but I'm leaning towards the latter because the trumpeted RPG aspect of the game is pretty much nonexistent. When I think ~RPG in a hospital,~ I imagine the freedom to be a great doctor, an evil doctor, a fat doctor, a lean doctor, et cetera. A skill-based system and dynamic but rudimentary NPC interaction doesn't cut it.   There is intriguing depth to the medical skill system, though. You have six different types of medicine, and you'll be able to give yourself a small headstart during character creation. The more you use one of those skills, the better it gets. There are ten levels for each skill, and you'll be able to treat increasingly grave conditions. As multiple skills reach certain levels, you'll unlock abilities that increase your skills even further (although sometimes one or two skills have to take a hit in order to grant a nice bonus to another).   You can have up to three of these enabled at a time, and their icons will rotate on the floor around you. Additionally, you can use ~perks,~ which are single-use and sometimes extremely rare (but extremely powerful) boosts. You can carry around up to four of those. One will bring all of your comfort meters back up to their maximum, another might give you a boost in energy or raise your composure, while a few items are just designed to give to another character to improve their attitude towards you.    Unfortunately, when it comes right down to it, the game doesn't require a lot of skill or dexterity. It's definitely aimed towards the casual gamer who's probably more a fan of the TV show than a fan of games. For those folks, they'll probably have a nice enough time talking with popular characters from the show and being a doctor. For me, though, it got a little monotonous. I think the main problem is that what I assumed was the crux of the game--performing operations and whatnot--is a matter of clicking on the patient and watching a progress dial go back and forth.    Sometimes their condition gets worse, and you don't have the skill to get them back down to your level, and must therefore shuffle them off to another doctor. Sometimes you put them in the wrong hospital bed and the nurse has to run off to get the supplies you need. But after a while, you learn how to avoid those problems, and the game becomes a factory line of diagnosing, sending to a bed, and healing them. Sure, sometimes you can't diagnose them and have to send them to the lab for testing, but that's pretty much the only consistent complication you might have to face.   Don't get me wrong--there is a structure to the game. You'll be given a steady trickle of missions, like treating specific people, locating certain people, and, treating specific medical conditions, and these are all on a timer, but these events seemed to both happen infrequently and happen when I was knee-deep in something else. Sometimes you'll be instructed to meet Joe Blow at the nurse's station, and you'll be given less than sixty seconds to comply. Unfortunately, you might already have been tasked with clearing out a surge of people in triage and will have to watch that room fill up, leading to getting harassed by the person who gave you that mission.   Also, many conversation segments disable your interface, and you're forced to watch people talk laboriously (no option to skip through dialogue that I could find) while people complain at you and your patients wait unattended. Making matters worse is that failure can lead to termination, which ends the game. The descriptor for some missions says ~Fireable offense? Yes.~ This suggests that you're not guaranteed to get canned, but you are, and it's game over. There also appears to be a bug when you're calling security to haul someone out. The guard comes over to you, goes to the perp, walks back to you and then says he couldn't see the perp. It appears to have something to do with pathfinding, a factor in the game which was otherwise pretty polished, actually.     So while the gameplay is probably deep enough for the casual player, I found that the pacing was actually too slow. Sure, you have things thrown at you right and left, but it also takes many, many real hours to complete a single shift and advance the story, which is pretty much described by more missions. When you get tired, you sleep in the hospital. Get hungry, eat at the hospital cafeteria (and the hunger aspect is unfortunately hidden within the Energy meter, so sometimes your character will refuse to sleep because he or she is too hungry, which can cause you to pass out and lose valuable game time before you can eat).Never leaving the hospital, and having only two storeys to navigate, and only treating patients on the ground floor can give you a feeling of cabin fever. When all you have to do is treat patients with the progress dial and occasionally talk to a fellow staff member, it just feels a little too much like work. Unlike The Sims, there are no objects to buy or structures to build to your liking. There's no additional set of clothes, no social gatherings, and no salary to spend anything on. Within these limitations, ER does well enough. But then again, the focus of the game becomes too narrow for anyone who doesn't love the show.", "date": "Jun 9, 2005"}
