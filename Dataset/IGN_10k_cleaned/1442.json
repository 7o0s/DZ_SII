{"name": "Red Dog", "name_review": "Red Dog", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/08/red-dog", "text": "For all the wondrous eye-candy we've seen, the mind-numbing gameplay depth we've played, and engrossing video game storylines that rival Hollywood movies we've experienced, sometimes there's nothing like obliterating the snot out of everything onscreen.  This Robotron-like mentality feeds a primal urge  kill everything.  Not that I'm a violence advocate; violence cannot solve all problems and when we do resort to violence, the outcome isn't what we usually want.  However, if race of aliens, which have been living peacefully on your planet, had been secretly planning to eliminate the human race and has decided to launch their plans now... I don't know about you, but I'd get into my custom tank with the speed of a Mustang, the shield technology from Star Trek, the laser cannons from an X-Wing fighter, and the swarming missile system borrowed from those Robotech fighters and whoop some serious alien tail.  That, in a nutshell, is what Red Dog is all about, and despite some dated, blocky visuals and simple special effects, Red Dog is an elegantly fun game with one simple goal  if it moves it, blow it up with unabashed ferocity.  The title of the game comes from the ride you cruise in  the Red Dog.  As cited above, this vehicle of superior destruction is best described as a ~moon buggy with a %@$#&$-up disposition~.  Armed with a powerful, rapid-laser cannon, a fast and accurate missile system, and supporting a shield defense system that would make Mr. Sulu smile, this is one bad-ass all-terrain monster that begs to be driven hard.  Using this death mobile, your job is to exterminate the Haak forces that have occupied various parts of the Earth.  Along the way, you'll find additional weapons and items that include explosive shells, Vulcan cannons, and powerful, sniper-like Ultra Laser.  Not that this is going to be an easy ride, mind you... you'll have to contend with swarms of alien soldiers on their turf.  And navigating through the caverns of the subterranean aliens might sound a bit scary... but in the Red Dog tank, it's nothing but fun.  Due to the all-terrain nature of your tank, driving through the environments is actually quite a fun experience and the Red Dog tank displays some of the most incredible maneuverability.  Driving and aiming is done with the Analog pad while the D-pad switches from third to first person.  Personally, playing the game in first person is an act of futility because your vehicle moves and turns so quickly, I'll be surprised if players who use this view won't get motion-sick.  One of the most unusual movement features is the Red Dog's ability to strafe where holding the L and R buttons will make your vehicle turn sideways.  From here, you can strafe right to left by pressing up or down on the Analog pad.  This is pretty cool, but also pretty weird; during this strafe mode, you're locked onto a straight path.  You don't circle around your enemy while strafing, but simple rock left to right.  Still, it's pretty cool that you have this option and comes in handy... if you can get used to the control.  The challenge of the game isn't from the enemies, though more and more enemies do appear as you move on to each level.  But with the incredible mobility and a energy shield, the difficulty in the game comes from getting used to the intricate controls.  Personally, I like the how much control you have over your tank's movement, and even though it can be a pain at times, once you get the hang of controlling your vehicle, you'll learn to appreciate how much fun it is to drive the Red Dog. Red Dog came out for the Dreamcast in Europe quite some time ago, and it's apparent in the visuals.  While the frame rate is solid, and the quality of the visuals are good, you can tell from the actual models of enemy characters, that these visuals are dated.  Block enemies are abundant throughout the game, and there's not much detail, even to the boss characters.  Furthermore, there are some decent special effects, especially how the missiles track their enemies that kinda reminds me of the homing missiles in Panzer Dragoon.  However, the explosion and smoke effects are very simple; even if you take out a platoon of soldiers, there's only a small ~poof~ of smoke.  If Red Dog gets kudos, it's in an excellent multi-player mode.  Good levels plus a number of play options are the condiments to the excellent frame rate that is shown even in a four-player game.  With all the action that goes on between four players, the game has yet to slowdown on me.  It's a shame that this game lacks online play, because that would've sealed an editor's choice deal. Red Dog isn't a simple killing spree; with its complex control scheme and crazy level design, I can see a lot of players giving up on this game because of the high learning curve on the learning to drive this crazy machine.  And the fact that the visuals aren't mind-blowing doesn't help, either.  However, if you can master the driving techniques, coordinate your driving and shooting accuracy, and look past a few dated visuals, Red Dog can be a lot of fun, especially in multi-player modes.  Because, once you get the hang of this thing, sometimes there's nothing better than the smell of napalm in the morning.  --Anthony ~Small Puppy~ Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 8, 2000"}
