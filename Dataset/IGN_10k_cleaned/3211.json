{"name": "Baseball", "name_review": "Baseball-e", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/15/baseball-e", "text": "is a direct emulation of the NES game released back in 1986, converted for play on the Game Boy Advance through the use of the e-Reader and its Dot Code technology. The game can only be played by swiping Baseball-e's five cards into the e-Reader device.  When this baseball game was released in arcades and the NES back in the mid-80s, there wasn't a whole lot of other hardball options. While folks were still playing their Realsports Baseball, M-Network Baseball, and other baseball titles on the Atari 2600 and Intellivision systems, Japanese gamers were hitting the ball around on the Famicom with this game. We got it in the US a couple years later, and it was good for its time...but we've moved on since then. As a mini-game it isn't too bad...it's just a little too basic. The only fielding you do is throwing to the base after one of your fielders snags the ball. There are only six teams in the game, and that just chooses the jersey color.   It would probably be a more enjoyable title if the game supported two players, but for some reason none of the e-Reader NES games support the link port. The two player mode has been disabled on the e-Reader version. It's good for a nostalgic run around the diamond, but don't expect any depth.", "date": "Nov 15, 2002"}
