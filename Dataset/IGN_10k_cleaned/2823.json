Someone had the bright idea to release Hooligans in the US the day after the 2002 Fifa World Cup ended...hang on, let me rephrase that...the day after the most trouble free World Cup in MEMORY ended...now that's gotta hurt your marketing push! Had they released this in the build up to the tourney, when fears were rampant that Japan and Korea would be invaded by mindless hoards intent on trashing every Karaoke Bar in sight, then they may have made a buck or three.   Hooligans is based on a simple premise, you take control of a group of hooligans and your objective is to cause as much mayhem as possible before, during and after a soccer match. You have 11 levels to get through, culminating in the ultimate hooligan wet dream event, the European Championships.    As with any RTS, you have resources to manage to keep your moronic thugs amused, and money is the cold hard resource of choice that makes your violent world go round. As the average thug is hardly likely to be a brain surgeon or have some other well paid career in their spare time, then obtaining dosh comes from the time honored system of looting, mugging and generally being a bit of a nuisance to the general population.      The more money you get, the more chance you have of keeping your current crew of morons happy by giving them free booze or drugs, recruiting better thugs and arming your motley crew with knives, chains and guns.   To prepare you for each level, you get to sit through a FMV presentation featuring some of the worst acting ever. The level of belief suspension required during these video eyesores is so high that I had to run to my DVD player and pop in a Michael Bay movie just to return me to normal.    The gameplay is simply a variation on the point, click & watch school of thought where you issue an order then more through luck than skill you watch your little hellions wreak havoc on a virtual European town.   The RTS engine is slow, clunky and unresponsive. The graphics are so dated that they would make a no graphic card P90 blush. The sound consists of a few poorly recorded chants and a voice over that sounded as if the acting talent had been hired from the outpatients dept of the local methadone clinic.   There is one realistic part of Hooligans though...Your little thugs are stupider than the plot of Baywatch Hawaii. They mill around mindlessly as another of your group gets stomped by rival fans or the police and do nothing to help. Unfortunately the same goes of the police. Shoot a cop from long distance and his colleagues stand around and do zip.    The makers of the game insist that 'There's enough humor in your Hooligans to even keep you going through the toughest battles! Well, if the definition of humor is shoddy programming values, lame voice acting, awful graphics and a total lack of attractive gameplay...Then they got it spot on as I laughed my ass off!   What did you think of Hooligans?   I am not going to address the controversy factor of this product, simply because that would be playing into the hands of the marketing people at the publishers and in my mind the only controversy is that they expect you to pay your hard earned cash for this steaming pile of excrement.  Had Hooligans been an action based game (a la GTA3) then it might have worked, but turning it into a shoddy RTS removes any thrill or excitement a person may feel from running round causing a ruckus. If you really want to play a game like this, buy GTA 3 and pretend that you are stealing cars etc to get to a soccer match...Or something...", "date": "Jul 31, 2002"}
