With realistic car physics and driving controls, Luxoflux's magnum opus humiliated half the field (including many racers), and with awesome graphics that looked even better blowing up, it humbled the rest of them. Between the crap third Twisted Metal edition and the mixed effort that was Rogue Trip (not a bad game, but note that it's the one without the sequel this year), V8 devastated without mercy.  Both Vigilante 8 and Twisted Metal are back at it again this year, and each brings to the table a number of additions and improvements in effort to demolish each other. TM brought the goods; now it's V8's turn to prove its metal.  Gameplay Car combat is a self-explanatory genre: car combat. For those looking for a story to go with the gameplay, there is one to be found in Vigilante 8: Second Offense, something about futuristic roadsters who've traveled back in time to annihilate a newlywed couple (in the future, weddings apparently tick people off). The story is told in a collection of stills in the load screen (obviously the story wasn't as paramount as in original PC Interstate '76 and '82), with text explaining the storyline. To keep the replay value high, each character has his own storyline that weaves between the game's 18 characters and affects what missions you have to run on a given stage in addition to handing out handfuls of pain. Unfortunately, most of the storyline is too threaded between the multiple characters to make much sense (and the text is written in Jive, so think of the scene in Airplane minus the subtitles).   But seriously -- Who cares about storyline when you've got an El Guerro with a missile launcher strapped to the roof? This game is about grinding steel, and the carnage here stands up well again this year. There aren't a lot of differences between Vigilante 8: Second Offense and its predecessor -- just more of what made the first game great. Eighteen cars are in this year, up from 12 last time, but there are only 12 levels (two less than last year). However, those levels are vast and fully flocked, with all kinds of modern architecture to level. Many stages contain hidden and yet natural additions that affect gameplay, such as the bobsled run and ski jump that you can compete in on the ski resort area, or the rocket silo that sends cars spiraling into space on the NASA stage. Other rounds, like the first game, are simply all about dropping buildings on opponents.  In comparison to Twisted Metal, Vigilante 8 hasn't made as many great strides this year. While TM improved the weapon system and added strategic complications to every round, V8: Second Offense has only added one weapon (a weak flame-thrower that doesn't have the same incendiary power or spreading properties of the flame thrower in TM4). Every weapon has four combo attacks now (up from two), which expands the number of attacks available as weapons take on alternative purposes or powers at the expense of ammo -- a missile can attach to your car and give you a speed burst, a mortar may be boosted to cause an earthquake. However, these attacks aren't explained in the manual at all (you almost need to buy the first V8 to figure out what these combo moves are good for), and even once you've figured them out, it's hard to remember these Mortal Kombat-type key codes to activate the special weapons.  V8: Second Offense also has a much better assortment of stages to fight in this year. The variety between stages is less (many are just battered shipyards AKA Long Beach or tattered steel refineries AKA Detroit), but the stages themselves have a lot of space to explore, with plenty of interactive highlights. In the snow area, blow up a gas can on a hill and you may cause an avalanche, or else loose the tethered barrels on the summit to go rolling through the playfield.   Of course, TM4 had similar additions, but V8: Second Offense offers more and better examples of this kind of supplemental gameplay (only the seas of fire and the magnetic crane really stick out from TM4). Of course, everything is destructible in V8, and that's always fun. But Luxoflux has now made that part of the game play strategy: In some cases, your job is to seek out certain buildings and level them; in others, your job is to protect the structures.   My issues with the game are few, but certainly not far between. Gameplay is still as good as last year, but some improvements have made the game even more prone to either errors, aggravation, or (most often) both. For one, mission objectives are a nice touch, but they're so trite and aimless that it makes no sense why you're putting yourself to such trouble for them. For instance, one mission has you protecting a floating barge for reasons unknown. Others have you collecting generalities such as bombs (which don't have a time limit and don't explode) or toolboxes. Toolboxes? Mission objectives couldn't possiblly be any more vague, as the game will tell you to destroy something and then not explain what that thing is. Other times, the game will tell you to protect a specific building or object, and yet the stage is so littered with similar objects that you'll have no idea which one to protect.   Some stages ask players to avoid the cops, which is a pain in the rear when you're in a heated battle. Personally, I spent the good part of 15 empty minutes searching an area for the right ski resort to deliver collected bags of loot to, and yet the bags never unloaded no matter what building I came to. Finally, I found that you have to tap a button to deliver the bags to just any old building -- other missions just end once you've done everything, so how would I know that I had to press a button to make a delivery? Quite irritating, and quite frequently so.  And then there's the control, which is buggy at times. Now, I am a sucker for a good physics engine (my favorite game now is Ubi's N64 game Rocket: ROR), so I appreciate Vigilante 8's car physics to no end. Vehicles feel like they're driving from the wheels, like they really are gripping the road with all of their weight and balance. This year's collection of cars improves much over last year's solid line-up, with more oddities such as the tipsy Dakota Stunt Cycle (yes, a motorbike in a car combat game) and the Moon Trekker (which has an independent suspension system that feels like the car is steering from its center). Stick shifting is missing, and the analog control isn't as accurate as the D-pad (especially with the combo attacks), but the control and physics are still miles ahead of any Twisted Metal game.  The only problem is that the physics engine is good, quite good even -- OK, it's really, really good, especially with everything going on in the game. But often the engine just goes haywire and throws the vehicle into a tizzy. Cars can stand on end as the camera spins round them trying to figure out what the physics engine is up to. They can stall without your knowing what's going on. They can get stuck on hills or behind objects, and your only way out is to crank the gas and hope something goes your way before you get nuked. Cars don't flip easily, but they also don't stay on all four wheels too often, and the engine doesn't handle that aspect too well. Of course, cars are floaty again, but that's a fair concession to the fun of soaring through the air off a ramp. However, the Hoverpod and Hydrofloater, which enable your car to fly and swim (respectively), are tough to control, and their skewed sense of balance means that targets are nearly impossible to aim for.   Graphics While almost not at all improved over last year's edition, Vigilante 8: Second Offense is still a hummer. Everything explodes with magnificence, just like last time, only this year the framerate has been locked down better (no arena is as nice as the Las Vegas stage of the original V8, but then again no stage feels the tremendous framerate drop and slowdown that buoyed that level). Effects are pushed to the maximum, with gentle waves lapping the shores of beaches, sharks and ghosts prowling their respective turfs, rough seas tossing your skiboat vehicle, lights with sharp lens flares (the sun has its own heliosphere effect), and working gondolas, trucks, trains, boats, ect. One weapon sends ripples through the ground of the entire arena surface, like somebody had picked up the floor and shook it like a carpet. The game is well-designed and again pushes the PlayStation beyond its meager 32-bit limitations.   Not fixed this year are the polygon glitches and sorting errors that made the first game look off. Whole buildings will clip out when you're up against a wall, and you'll often see backgrounds that you can't get to. After bashing each other head-on for a few seconds, cars will magically pass through each other. Targeting is effected by this graphic glitching, as you'll often see a homing lock on a vehicle that's in another room. In fact, some of the graphic errors are made worse this year by the graphic upgrade. The resolution has been bumped up some, and textures are more detailed (but many textures in the first game were more contrasted and crisp). This improved detail hurts the game when you're up close on an object, as door frames and other straight lines will jag, tear, and shift left and right as you try to push in. The game still looks nice once you settle into it, but the flaws are amplified this year, and (compared to other systems) the PS version suffers the worst hit of all editions of the game.   Sound Another funkadelic soundtrack from Luxoflux, the nastiest funkmasters to ever throw down. Again, not much has changed (but, then again, how much about the '70s has changed since the '70s?), but the music is even more funky this year, with stand outs such as a remix of Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (thanks Sumi for the assist), a Latin dance groove, and two others with enough wacca-chikka guitar work to bring back disco. And while the tracks don't remix and loop themselves in the game, the next tune comes up rather quickly once one has run through.  The metal crunching sound effects are similarly great. Cars all have distinct engine noises (check out the Moon Trekker for a great engine sound effect), with deep, gutteral motor chugging and distinct gear shifts. All of this fine work is buried, of course, by the chaos and onslaught surrounding you. Bombs, missiles, rockets, machine guns, and mortars all have appropriately fearsome sounds. Also included are samples of trees falling, crocs roaring, buildings toppling, and movie projectors running.Despite its faults, Vigilante 8 is just as fun the second time around. However, while a lot of work has been done under the hood, the game still runs almost exactly the same. Cooperative play, vehicle enhancements, mission-based structure -- none of it improves the game much. And considering that the graphics are only marginally improved this year, there's not a lot to recommend here over the now bargain-bin original. However, the gameplay is more balanced, and the new cars are great.The other matter to consider here is how much the PlayStation edition of the game falls behind its competitors. The N64 and Dreamcast versions, while not perfect either, are so superior graphically that I must suggest you look at those copies first if you have one of those systems -- they're well worth the extra money. Luxoflux and Activision are pushing the PlayStation as hard as possible, and at times it just can't keep up.That said, the game here still plays as well as can be expected on any system, and while the inaccuracies and annoyances are bothersome, they don't take much away from this solid game.", "date": "Dec 16, 1999"}
