Outside of being a pack-in on several of Konami's arcade compilations that have appeared over the years, most people have forgotten about the game. That hasn't stopped it from coming to the Xbox Live Arcade at a cost of 400 Microsoft Points ($5 USD). Five bucks is too high of an asking price for this retro game; especially considering the confusing presentation decisions and gameplay that hasn't stood the test of time.     The way in Scramble plays is basic, as you might expect from a 25 year old game. Players navigate a spaceship down a corridor while enemies try to take them down. To deter these nasty beings that want you dead, you'll be armed with bombs and a standard forward shooting gun. A single touch from any of the enemies or the surrounding cave means instant death. Destruction can also come from a constantly draining fuel gauge which must be filled by destroying fuel tanks on the ground. There are only six short levels to fight through, but the difficulty of doing so will cause you to invest some time before you can master Scramble.   The old-school gameplay isn't nearly as engaging as it was in the early '80s, especially when you look at the better shooters that are out on Live Arcade. It's simplistic and completely pattern based, allowing for memorization to be king. AI has come a long way over the past two decades and it is sorely missed when you start up a game that doesn't have any. The patterns that the enemies come in aren't particularly fun or exciting either. The arcade button mashing mania that most old school shooters are famous for isn't present in Scramble.    A new look with an old feel. Scramble does have a two player co-operative mode available only through Xbox Live. It shouldn't even be allowed to be called co-operative because the only thing that you are working with another player with is the score. You'll see their game up alongside yours, but they're playing their own game while you play yours. It's ~co-operative~ because your scores add. It's not nearly as fun as real co-operative games are and it gets worse if you die first. If you do you'll be stuck watching the other person play while you sit and wait. Having the option to just fly around and play a game while they finish theirs off would be much better. Making things worse is the extra-ship oddities that occur during co-op. When your score reaches 10,000 an extra ship is awarded. This confuses the game during co-operative sessions. Sometimes you will think you have one ship left, but then the game over screen will flash up followed by your remaining ship disappearing from the tally.     This co-op may be strange, but even more mind numbing is the fact that you can't play it offline. Although the ability to include this is clearly there since you can do it online, you can only play a multiplayer game offline by trading turns.    There's also an online versus mode. Here, opponents play simultaneously and try to get the highest score. You can't actually get your highest score in this mode. As soon as the player with the lower score dies, the game is essentially over. You won't be able to continue on for any sort of extended time to see just how much you can beat them by. In fact, if you die just after their game ends then your game is over too.   The original Scramble in all of its glory. Our experience with the online play was mixed. We had a few times where we had trouble joining up with another player through the Quick Match feature. The game kept telling us that the session we tried to join was no longer available. We also noticed some slight lag while playing co-operative or versus matches, but the lag wasn't game killing by any means.   Scramble features a full set of online and offline leaderboards. Scratch that. It features online leaderboards. Like some other Live Arcade games, your offline high score is only saved until you turn off the game. Each time you boot up the game, you'll find an empty high score list. Take that ability to easily track your progress!   Thankfully, the graphics and sound in Scramble have been given a complete overhaul. Things weren't so pretty in 1981 (which you can see by switching to the classic appearance in the menu). The new explosions have nice particle effects, but everything otherwise has the appearance of a homemade Flash game. The sound has also been revamped. The explosions and bomb dropping sounds are good, but if you're not firing anything you'll notice that there really isn't any sound to be heard.    Scramble is an old game that didn't really need to be reworked for another release. Better shooters are available for free on the web or for a small fee through Live Arcade. If you loved Scramble in 1981, then there might be something here worth looking at. Otherwise, you'd be much better off sticking with Galaga or Geometry Wars.", "date": "Sep 13, 2006"}
