One, the developers were obviously trying to bring a Metal Slug inspired game design to the GBA system but missed the boat entirely on what made that game such a great classic. And two, the original game hit the US several months after the sequel was already in the can over in the European market, so the version we were playing already felt dated. The aforementioned follow-up has finally reached these shores more than a half a year later, and even though it still doesn't quite match the inspiration design, CT Special Forces: Back to the Trenches is a decidedly better, more impressive game experience than the original. There's still room for improvement, though, and we'll have to wait to play the already-released-in-Europe CT Special Forces 3: Bioterror before we can see if the fixes were made. Features 20 levels Four playable characters Four different play modes Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Password save CT Special Forces 2: Back in the Trenches is an action game that builds upon the graphic and gameplay foundation constructed in CT Special Forces. The original CT Special Forces was a side-scrolling, guns-blazing action game inspired by what's considered the best-of-the-best, mindless side-scrolling guns-blazing action games: Metal Slug. The problem was, there were too many hitches in CT Special Force's game design that drew attention to themselves and did more to pull players out of the fantasy that they were playing a Metal Slug game.  Luckily for the sequel, the foundation's been strengthened by the designers, pulling out elements that didn't work the first time around and reinforcing elements that did. The result is a much more maniacal shooter this time around, with much faster pacing, more detailed graphics, a better soundtrack...an overall more fun experience. The game adds variety by jumping from side-scrolling on-foot levels to airborne helicopter missions, to Silent Scope-inspired mini-missions of sharpshooting challenges. It's decidedly more than a Metal Slug design due to its focus on putting more variety into the challenges.  But even with the improvements made to the original game, the sequel is not nearly as good as it can be. First of all, it's still too short, with only about 20 missions total...and no encouragement for replay. The side-scrolling design, the game's main focus, isn't quite as balanced as it should be, even with its fixes from last year: level designs have too many ~blind~ jumps built into them, making it difficult to move forward unharmed due to platforms that have scrolled off the side of the screen. Players can jump upwards through platforms but not downwards, due to a pretty useless ~roll~ technique added to his arsenal.  And not quite up there in the list, but still pretty important: the game is still tethered to an awkward password system that does nothing but record the player's last earned level and the amount of lives he has left.  On the plus side, CT Special Forces 2 looks and sounds fantastic on the Game Boy Advance hardware. Though there's not that much in the way of special hardware effects the sheer amount of animation frames for pretty much anything that moves, from enemy soldiers to violent explosions, is stunning. At the very least, the game development studio employs some pretty talented pixel artists for the CT Special Forces project. The audio is also pulled off skillfully in the game, with decent samples used for the many different weapons and enemies in the game. There are some areas where the audio gain is put a bit too high, causing some unnecessary static in the speaker, but players can fix that by simply hitting the options menu and reducing the levels. CT Special Forces 2 is good but not great. The game is significantly better than last year's original, offering an obvious set of tweaks and improvements to the overall action experience on the Game Boy Advance. But it still has a few obvious problems in its design that needs to be addressed for the third game -- but since the second sequel has already been wrapped up and shipped in Europe, no amount of griping about its precursor will get the developers to fix it, at least for the next game in the series. We'll just keep our fingers crossed and hope for the best when Hip Games release Number", "date": "Aug 1, 2004"}
