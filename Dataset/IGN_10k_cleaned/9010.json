Regarded as the bespectacled, nerdy uncle of the gaming family, it's the gun-toting, over-the-top FPS brother-in-law who gets all the attention at the family Christmas party. Yet, while the FPS basks in the glory of his good-looks, exciting tales and booming voice, the RTS quietly sits back doing his own thing, soldiering on as one of the most enduring genres.    World in Conflict aims to change this sad story. It presents the RTS in a new light; no more hours of base-building and drawn out strategy. Instead it throws players right into the fight, with the immediacy and explosive action normally associated with shooters. It casts its Napalm-filled net much further than armchair generals and desk-bound dictators, hoping to attract the ADD-riddled gamers that prefer their gaming sessions to last minutes rather than hours.    And, we're quite happy to say, it's succeeded.      Set in an alternate history of 1989, WIC's world is one in which the Cold War doesn't end with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism and a booming trade in Russian mail-order brides. It goes for the much more exciting conclusion of all-out war between the USSR and America, tactical nukes and all.   This setting is recent enough to include most of the vehicles and weaponry that we're used to seeing on the 6 o'clock news. But now they're being employed against equally equipped forces, rather than insurgents with slingshots. The story of WIC is central to the game, presented via tasteful water-coloured slides, jaw-smacking in-game cut scenes and frequent battlefield voiceovers. A strong story demands strong characters, and WIC has more than enough to drag it kicking and screaming from one battle to the next.    You play as Parker, a character whose face is never revealed, allowing you to inhabit his combat boots with ease. You're the favourite of the veteran general, a tougher-than-tank-treads warrior who commands respect. But, unlike most games, the story isn't about you. Instead, it revolves around a green officer by the name of Bannon, fresh out of West Point with an oversized ego to compensate for his undersized dose of courage. As the story progresses, Bannon slowly develops from trigger-happy asshole, to a solid soldier, and ultimately to true war hero.    While it occasionally errs on the side of cheesiness, for the most part the story reflects the talent of its chief architect, Larry Bond (co-author of Red Storm Rising and many other novels). He treats the subject with the realism and authenticity that it requires, allowing the player to believe that this conclusion to the Cold War isn't so far-fetched.    So it's got the triple A storyline that is so often absent from strategy games, but at the end of the battle it's all about gameplay. And it's here that WIC truly shines, both for its ability to make a five hour period of your life disappear in the blink of an eye, and for the fearless way in which it delivers an original, fresh take on the RTS genre.   Yes, this is an in-game cut scene. In an RTS.   Those of you who like to spend hours building concrete walls, watchtowers and Tiberium refineries might be a little put off by the total lack of base-building in WIC. While fortification of capture points is crucial to success, it's an automated process in the game. Simply roll a few units into the capture point, and the game automatically builds a three-tier defence system around each. A machine gun post comes first, then an anti-tank bunker, and finally an anti-air base. The more units in the capture point, the faster these defensive structures are built. And that's it. There's no need to mine for resources, block off choke points or string out minefields.    Instead, this game is all about the thrill of the battle. At the start of each round the player is given a limited number of resource points, used to order troops and vehicles which are dropped in by an impressive C-130 swooping over the landscape. Lead your units into a firestorm of death, and their resource points will be added to the resource pool, allowing you to call in reinforcements. It keeps the focus of the game firmly on action rather than resource management.    It's rare to have more than ten or so unit types under your control at any one time, and smart commanders will group these into four or five groups. We tended to stick to two infantry based groups, comprised of a mixture of anti-tank, infantry and snipers, as well as a couple of armour based groups and one or two support groups (depending on the mission, these were either Anti-Air, vehicle-repair or artillery units). However, the missions change up the challenges often enough that the tank-rush that worked so well in the last mission will lead to molten death in the next. Using the units in the right way is a must - infantry are great for getting cover inside buildings and forests, while tanks and APCs are better as stand-off vehicles. And if you send your rocket-artillery straight to the frontline, well, you're probably better off playing Pong.    Controlling the units couldn't be simpler, and again, feels more like a shooter than an RTS. The camera controls are actually identical to a shooter - WASD to move around and the mouse to aim. Not once did we feel less than totally in control of our perspective. Best camera ever in an RTS game? Yes indeed. You'll spend most of your time hovering about half way out, but when there's a battle raging with your units set up in an optimal position, it's always fun to zoom right into the unit level to get a soldier's eye view. Unlike Company of Heroes, doing so won't bring the frame rate to a crunching halt, a staggering achievement given the amazing detail of the game's visuals.   You really don't want to take on this many tanks with a scout chopper.   Every unit has one or two special abilities. Forget to use these and you'll find death is a mere mouse click away. The ability to lay out movement waypoints is handy, but the navigation AI tends to do a fine job on its own. There are only two formation options - box and line. A few more, such as arrowhead and trail, would have been appreciated.    Friendly combat AI is exceptional. Rarely did we need to keep an eye on our troops, as they're smart enough to get the job done without the threat of latrine-cleaning duties. Enemy AI is also very robust, although it does tend to rush straight into heavily defended areas rather than sit back and use the range advantages of certain units properly. For experienced RTS fans, cranking the difficulty up to hard is an absolute must, else you'll breeze through the campaign without breaking a sweat (ten hours or so for the first run through). But for the rest of us, the standard difficulty level should prove challenging, without keyboard-smashing levels of frustration kicking in.    A massive part of the game is the use of tactical aids. As you progress through the game, a tactical aid counter slowly increases, unlocking the use of a multitude of death-dealing options. Whether it's a laser guided bomb strike, a tank-busting A-10 run or the ultimate in whoop-ass -  the tactical nuke -  each and every one is as satisfying to use as it is necessary.    ...or this will happen.  You'll fight across a broad range of battlefields - from the cold, snow-covered fields of Russia to battles in urban America. Each location tends to have its own unique batch of vehicles: in one mission you'll be commanding a small squad of Norwegian ski-troopers, the next you'll be hauling ass in a NATO armoured division. Further upping the variety ante is the mix of mission types. While most involve the smiting of your enemy in one way or another, the methods of doing so rarely repeat. You'll be tasked with capturing enemy hills, destroying downed stealth bombers and everything in between. It all adds up to one of the most varied RTS games we've seen.   Not to mention, easily the prettiest. Even if you don't have a PC from the year 2015, the presentation of the game is quite simply astonishing, and proof that NVIDIA wasn't wrong in comparing it to Crysis. Thankfully our test PC, a Core 2 Duo overclocked to 3.3GHz, with 2GB of DDR800 and a GeForce 8800GTX, churned through the game like an RPG hitting the side of a school bus. Regardless of whether you're zoomed right into ground level, admiring the nuts and bolts holding the TOW launcher onto the top of a Bradley, or zoomed out to see the level stretch for tens of kilometres in every direction, with vast forests and cities in view, the game always looks breathtaking.     Given that a large portion of your time will be spent lobbing explosive things at other things filled with explosives, the game's amazing detonation and debris effects are most appreciated. The animation is also spot-on, from the way your troops sprint to cover, to the recoil of a tank firing a heavy round.    Everything in sight is totally destructible, so the pristine French seaside town you start off in, will soon become nothing more than a pile of smoking rubble. You can even burn out forests with Napalm and artillery, allowing heavy units to advance while denying enemy infantry of valuable cover. As the levels begin to resemble the seventh level of Hell, dark clouds roll in while the music and sound effects change to a more sombre mood, giving the game a palpable war-time atmosphere.    This is a as base-buildy as it gets - a machine gun post.  The end result of these stunning visuals reminds us of playing with our GI Joes and plastic model kits as a kid, only a gazillion times better. Instead of making do with the seven figures our parents could afford, staging mock battles in the front yard, WIC allows us to wage virtual battles with dozens of detailed vehicles and troops fighting out through intricate, destructible dioramas. It's every war-fanatic's wet dream.   WIC was first designed as a multiplayer game, and it shows. While the singleplayer is nothing short of amazing, multiplayer is truly revolutionary for an online RTS. We realise that the word revolutionary is bandied about more than a 10 out of 10 score in an official gaming mag, but for once it's actually true.   Which other RTS has a true client/server model, allowing totally lag-free 16-player matches? Name another RTS that has such crystal clear VOIP that it makes the likes of Skype and Ventrilo look amateur?    Clan support is common for shooters, but WIC is the first RTS to deliver such deep clan-management and tournament support. Players can even make their Massgate (the overall online system used by the game) avatar image show up on the side of their units in-game, adding that personal touch.   The game should prove to be a massive hit at gaming tournaments due to its clever broadcasting feature. This allows the commentator to view the match from a variety of pre-placed cameras, as well as focus on interesting parts of the match such as the delivery of artillery barrages or particularly fierce fire-fights.     Thanks to its drop-in, drop-out nature, this is the first online RTS that encourages casual play. And due to the lack of base-building, a battle can swing at any time, as the IGN crew found out at the recent Sierra Gamer's week. During the grand final of a journo-filled tournament, we had certain victory snatched from us in the final minutes of the game. While the sting of defeat took days to get over, never has losing felt so exciting.    In short, WIC's multiplayer game absolutely deserves every online gamer's attention, and should prove especially appealing to shooter and action fans.   Heat up your chilly foes with a light artillery barrage. You can probably tell by now how enamoured we are of WICs presentation of war. Yes, we absolutely adore it, but will everybody? Sadly, probably not. Specifically the supercore RTS player. Those who spend days poring over printouts of levels to figure out optimal fencing and defensive positions will struggle with the immediacy of WIC. But for the rest of us, especially those who get bored within the first 30 minutes of most RTS missions, this immediacy is exactly what Dr Strangelove ordered. And the fact that its got the most rewarding depiction of dropping nukes surely cant hurt either.WIC excels in so many areas, its hard to fault. Its one of the most attractive games weve ever seen, has a truly interesting storyline, offers plenty of variety considering it could have so easily been a one-trick pony, and redefines the expected feature-set of an online RTS. It smashes down the barriers that prevent many folks from enjoying strategy games, while at the same time offering the depth that the genre is renowned for. Whether youre a strategy fan or not, youd be silly not to take a look at WIC. Without doubt, one of the finest, freshest RTS games weve played in years.", "date": "Sep 8, 2007"}
