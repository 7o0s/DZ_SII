Fortunately, you'd be wrong, and it only takes a handful of races to begin unravelling Excite Truck's many charms, all of which are driven by cleverly designed gameplay mechanics and severely undulating courses. In fact, while Excite Truck may look relatively simple on the surface, it's not only a great arcade racer, but an excellent reinvention of the Excite series' motocross roots.   The most compelling aspect of Excite Truck is that you're never just racing, you're always trying to maximise every corner, every jump and every encounter with other racers. This game is about more than just coming first, it's - as Nintendo games invariably are - about stars. Catch a little air and you might earn one star, but launch into several seconds of hang time and you may be able to max the jump out, earning a full five stars. Similarly, clipping another vehicle will earn you a couple of stars, while ramming the hell out of an opponent will net you more.    Every race is about the pursuit of stars, and in addition to catching air or crumpling a rival into a mess of metal, you can also get stars by drifting around corners, driving close to a series of trees without hitting them, landing on all four wheels (which also nets you a turbo boost), doing tricks in the air and soaring through sequences of airborne rings. Hell, you even get a commiserative star for crashing, which is Nintendo's way of saying ~there, there; you might suck but Shiggy still loves you~.   Seriously, don't play Chicken with a twister. It won't end well.  Of course, the star system wouldn't mean anything without seriously rocking, adrenaline-laced gameplay mechanics, and Excite Truck's got you covered. This is a game that lives and breathes turbo. If you're not boosting every second you can on the ground, boosting when you catch air and boosting again when you land, you're simply not doing it right.   Powering this boost-fuelled mayhem is a system that takes the original Excitebike mechanics and expands on them. Yes, the temperature gauge is back, so if you boost for too long on the ground, you'll blow your engine and spend several embarrassing seconds waiting for it to magically repair itself before you can gun it at top speed again. Driving through shallow water instantly cools your engine, which is a great inclusion, meaning you can use any water on the course (or pickup that can create more water - but more on that in a sec) strategically to get maximum boost. That's only the beginning, however. Tap the boost button as you're about to catch some air and you'll be - I'm getting sick of using the B word here so bear with me - propelled through the air at a greatly increased velocity. This system makes every jump another source of speed and air, capable of vaulting you not only into first place, but also into the good graces of the star system that casts its heavenly light upon the game. Best of all, hitting the ground sees yet another opportunity to get temporarily heightened acceleration. Land on all four wheels (by tilting the controller forwards or backwards as required) and you'll gun away at speed, ready for the next jump.   So yeah, you can adjust your truck's orientation in mid-air for a smooth landing, but you can also do a whole lot more. Think you're going to overshoot a jump? Tilt the Wiimote forward to land earlier. Want maximum air so you can literally fly over an entire corner of the course? Tilt the Wiimote back for extra air time and steer your truck as needed. It's great fun nailing jump after jump, boosting almost the entire time, and heavily reminiscent of the rhythm of motocross. Bless you, Excitebike.   The stylish way for Mongol warlords to get over the Great Wall.  Rounding out the Excite Truck Experience are the icons scattered about each course. Can you guess what the ~POW~ icons do? It's a tricky one, we know, but if your guess was ~transports your car to bizarre-o-world where going slowly backwards nets you anti-stars~ you'd be wrong. Nice idea though. No, the POW icons give you max acceleration and near invulnerability for a short period of time. Have at you, trees! Far more interesting, however, are the other breed of icons. Running over one of these puppies (not the best expression to use when describing a racing game I agree) performs mysterious, wondrous magic upon the course. Truly, it is digital witchcraft of the highest order and skill, for where once there was but a flat section of track, now lies - doth mine eyes deceive me? - a steep incline, ripe for boostification! And where once the path was land - ye gods! - now it hath sunk into the very earth, crafting a watery path! Yes, the many icons transform the courses in a multitude of ways, and if you happen to trigger a terrain morph while opponents are on that section of track, they'll be flung high into the air, letting you blaze on by.    Courses take the player all around the world, to the dirt paths of the Mexican desert, the tropical beachside runs of Fiji, the wide open wilderness and stream beds of Canada, beside ancient castles in rain soaked Scotland, to the perpetual winter of snow covered peaks in Finland and along the steep, winding paths of China, through and over the Great Wall. It even has its own Rainbow Road style course, called - creatively enough - Crystal Road.   The track design is mostly excellent, making good use of all the gameplay mechanics. Indeed, it's relentlessly working each course for every possible star that makes the game so compelling. On first attempt some courses seem to demand an unlikely number of stars, but it's not long before you get your game plan in order - boosting into opponents at the start, making sure you max out your drift on that long, winding corner, learning how much air to catch off each jump as well as where to use the air control for a sneaky shortcut, not to mention which paths to take, which icons to activate and when to sneak in a spin or two while in the air.    Fiji - the military coup is symbolically represented by the volcano. Levels Jerry, levels.  Of course, merely passing each course is only the beginning. In fact, you can get the requisite number of stars for every course on the Excite difficulty level, but still not unlock Super Excite. You need to S rank each course to unlock the higher difficulty, and that requires a solid grasp of all the game's tricks but even so you're not looking at a game that's going to last forever. Love it as we do, Excite Truck will be more of a fling for most - an intense period of hedonistic boosting that won't last. For once each course's every crevice has been well and truly explored and each ring licked, the passion will fade, as Excite Truck has little else beyond its main race mode to hold a gamer's appeal.   Oh sure, there's the Challenge mode, with its Gate, Ring and Crush challenges, but will they hold you tight in the dead of night? No, they won't. In fact, both Gate and Ring, which charge you with going through a series of narrowing gates and with hitting rings in the air respectively, verge on hair-pullingly frustrating, while Crush, which is a demolition derby of sorts, is too easy. None have the delicate grace, the raw throbbing power of the main race mode.   Then there's Versus. Oh what a disappointment! No online play for you, just two player split-screen with no AI opponents. Terrain deformation is still in effect, but the frame rate really takes a hit, lessening the sense of speed, not to mention the smooth feel of the controls. In other words, don't buy this game for multiplayer - it's an okay diversion, but less fun than it could be.   Another thing to bear in mind is that while the controls are simplicity itself, over zealous gamers may need to reign their movements in somewhat - tilt too far to the left or right and the game ceases to register a direction. It's a pity that the sensitivity of the controls can't be adjusted either, but thankfully the races are rough and tumble enough that the odd control quirk isn't the end of the world. One other thing we should mention about the controls is that the mid-air tricks are quite clumsily implemented - they feel goofy to execute and really don't bring anything to the game. Oh well, there's still a huge amount to like.   Super happy tree run fun.  While much has been made of the Wii's lack of power under the hood, Excite Truck ain't no slouch. In single player it's fast and smooth, the land deformation looks good, and during those epic jumps you can see a long way into the distance. Sure, the truck models are pretty average and look like toys when they crash, and sure, the environments aren't all that detailed, but overall Excite Truck's style and speed suit the gameplay well, and that's what's important.   The same can't be said for the utterly generic soundtrack, however. Rock muzak is probably the best description and you'll be reaching for the sound options menu faster than we can say ~really sodding quick~. Thankfully you can listen to your own tunes via mp3s on an SD card, but honestly, will anyone bother? We just put the stereo on.  Excite Truck is a fast and combative arcade racer with seriously elegant game design. Its not a game thats going to last you forever, but theres plenty of gameplay on offer for those who like their racers on the arcade side of the fence.Want to have your say?
