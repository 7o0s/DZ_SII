The classic block dropping puzzler could easily fit into a nice downloadable package and features the quick, arcade style of game that the service has been striving for. But Tetris Evolution is not on the Xbox Live Arcade. Instead, it's a ~budget~ priced retail release clocking in at a relatively pricey $29.99 (USD). Despite the ~Evolution~ tagline, this is just Tetris we're talking about. The question then becomes one of whether the bells and whistles justify the retail cost. The answer is clearly that they don't. Tetris Evolution should have been released on the Xbox Live Arcade.   When it comes to Tetris, presentation is everything. We've all played Tetris before thanks to its penchant for showing up on every console ever. You can even play countless Flash versions for free on the web. It's the substance around the game and the available modes that make it worth purchasing over and over again. In the case of Tetris Evolution, the presentation is a mixed bag that may appeal quite strongly to some but winds up being a tad disappointing in the end.   One of the biggest gripes Tetris fans will have with Evolution doesn't have to do with the game itself. Rather unfortunately for THQ, the Xbox 360 controller is not ideal for Tetris. Playing a precise game such as Tetris is never perfect with an analog stick and the 360 d-pad leaves much to be desired. Misplacement and early drops are the norm for a few hours while you work to get used to the awkward d-pad. This isn't a fault with the game itself, but it takes away from the overall enjoyment that it can deliver.   Controller issues aside, the game customization options are wide enough to please most Tetris aficionados. The classic marathon mode makes an appearance as does the often seen cascade. Additionally, there are six other ways to drop blocks with everything from the quick timed ones to goal oriented scoring systems. There are also plenty of options for customizing specific elements of the gameplay itself. Players can turn on or off the ghost tetrimino that indicates where your piece will drop, switch the ability to rotate pieces endlessly before they lock down, change fill rates, turn the grid on or off, and even adjust how many tetriminos will show up in the queue (with a maximum of 2).     The best feature in this iteration of Tetris is the inclusion of Xbox Live support. Up to four players can play either online or off in one of three styles. The standard versus mode is there where players send blocks over to their opponent as they are cleared as is a noncompetitive independent mode. The coolest addition to this game is the hotseat style of multiplayer Tetris where players take turns controlling the tetriminos on a single board in a cooperative challenge. It's nothing revolutionary, but playing this mode with a friend is surprisingly fun. Each of these three styles can be played across the eight different game modes, allowing for some decent variety in your online game. It would have been nicer to have more players online, say perhaps 10 like the Tetris DS Adhoc game share allows, but the set of modes is fairly robust as it is. Now if we could just get some power-ups into the game to mix things up a bit   Tetris with the fishies. That's one way to fill up an empty screen. This being Tetris, one shouldn't expect a visual treat though some questionable moves were still made. Oddly enough, the actual Tetris game board only takes up a tiny portion of the screen, even in single player mode. There aren't any options for stretching your play field either. The majority of the screen consists of an icon, border and background, each of which can be customized from a list of preset choices. The icons and borders, even with their nice variety, won't catch your eye nearly as much as the backgrounds which can only be described as strange.    There are 15 of these video backgrounds with everything from leaping flames to a grazing giraffe. Because you know you wanted to have a giraffe eating leaves in the background as you play Tetris. These videos, which can be made still or into shifting slideshows if the motion bugs you, are presumably the only thing on the disc that would make a Live Arcade download impossible due to size issues. Tetris can run in 1080p, but even in HD you can see some compression artifacts and fuzziness on these backgrounds which defeats the purpose a bit.   The goofy backgrounds could easily have been dropped had this game been on the Live Arcade and we wouldn't have cared one bit. There is one welcome feature that comes with a full retail game and that is Tetris Evolution's 1000 Achievement Points. There's a good mix here that will take intermediate players a fair number of hours to unlock though advanced players will have no trouble getting them all in a few hours. The only real gripe we have with the Achievements is that the default settings for each game mode are not aligned with every achievement. Simply playing the game won't net you all 1000 points. Instead, you'll have to go back and forth between the Achievement list and the game several times adjusting game settings to even be able to unlock everything. It's a small complaint but one that easily could have been fixed with some sort of in-game goal structure.     While Tetris Evolution has enough features to make it worthwhile to anybody looking for a falling block fix, the package simply feels out of place. The Xbox Live Arcade was made for simplistic games just like this and the Tetris Evolution feature set and presentation just isnt robust enough to warrant a retail release. If you dont mind dishing out a few extra bucks for a game youve played hundreds of time before, just keep in mind that the Xbox 360 controller holds back the gameplay needlessly.", "date": "Mar 27, 2007"}
