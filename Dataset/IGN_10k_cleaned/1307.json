The journey was the joy. To go for miles and miles, bravely face the fiercest of beasts, and discover the hidden treasures in the corners of the world. Great voyages were sought for the glory and adventure. Dragon Quest (known to you and I as Dragon Warrior) once reigned as lordly caliber in the great halls of history, so very long ago...  Features:  Both epic Dragon Quest games on one cartridge Enhanced graphics, added effects, and recomposed dialog Battery back-up for game saves in both adventures For standard Game Boy and Game Boy Color    Those days have long passed. RPGs have grown up. Pots of gold at the end of the rainbow and mythical dragons terrorizing the land are now side quests. There's a deeper meaning to playing an RPG, and that's why Square Soft has had such phenomenal success with their latest Final Fantasy and other adventure games. Sometimes you don't even know that the world needs saving until you're skin-deep in the thick of saving it. Noble blood means nothing when the society is capitalist, aristocratic, or militaristic. Damsels don't need rescuing -- they need a battle axe and some magic tutoring in the field.  Dragon Warrior is a relic from the primal days of RPG design. Those were times when more gameplay time was spent leveling up and wandering than actually venturing forward. Visuals were all but ignored. Plots began with a credit crawl and didn't resume again until the protagonist had enough Experience Points to venture more than a few paces from the home castle. It was a simple time, and games like Everquest have recently returned to those simple days of just ambling through the countryside, itching for a fight.  Enix makes a play for nostalgia with this Dragon Warrior collection, and does so well. The quest at hand is a brilliant and expansive one, a journey through acres of territory to the very ends of the land. Terrible beasts lurk at every step, and friendly town folk look for profit with every smile. Somewhere out there are magical transports and awe-inspiring weapons. The imagination is complimented well in this journey, for in its fabrications are sometimes inklings of what's up ahead.  But it's a quaint, often lonely voyage, and an arduous one at that. Some say that the street is cobbled with danger, but it's hardly a road at all, and much of the gameplay time is spent simply finding out which path out of a million inconsequential others to take. Between the two, there's an epic quest in both Dragon Warrior I and II, but both are still mired in the dungeons of D&D, only taking cautious (and yet substantial for the time) steps towards emotional impact. The plot of the original Dragon Warrior is hardly a plot at all. It's a direction: find the princess and slay the dragon. You spend little time finding out why; instead, you wander village to village for hours trying to amass the arsenal to accomplish the task. Twists and turns in that road are few, and though there are some lively characters, the game ends exactly as promised -- with a dead dragon and a gratefully liberated princess.  However, for fans of Dragon Warrior / Quest, there's still much to love in this voyage. For one, the games have been vastly updated in the interface. No longer must you wade through menus to talk to citizens, search the ground, or take ladders. Now natural processes are virtually automatic. Implementation of a Field Log, which lets players save their quest temporarily outside of the main castle, take much of the tedious retracing that was once required. Much befitting a hendheld, Dragon Warrior is now almost a pick-me-up game, where players can make a quick run for some Wyvern pelts in a car ride.   Still, some of Enix's changes may not have been for the best. For one, the re-translation has been skewed quite young. The warriors are cutesy with huge eyes; the monsters are cuddly little menaces. Gone is the Elizabethan English dialog, and the game just doesn't feel the same without a gratuitous 'thee' or 'thou' thrown in. Character names have been changed from the initial English versions to more direct translations of the Japanese names -- perhaps this was always Enix's choice, as Nintendo may have asked them to change that aspect when they were the publisher of the original NES game in America, but having this 'Director's Cut' version of Dragon Quest diminishes the reminiscing when your beloved friends Erdrick and Princess Gwalin have been replaced with the cartoonish Loto and Lora. And those who remember the cameo appearance of Nintendo's Nester in their first voyage will search in vain for the character in this new quest.  Graphically, Enix did very nice things with the visuals in this game. Compared to the chunky old NES versions, the monsters virtually pop off the screen, and the towns flourish with life. Landmarks are much more clear, and even the main map is more impressive. All of this was crucial for this game, since the smaller size of the Game Boy screen cuts the viewing distance almost by half. If the world wasn't memorable visually, players would be instantly lost in the bland kingdom.  Still, more should have been done with the game. Chiefly, improvements direly needed in Dragon Warrior II were skipped. The backgrounds behind monsters in battles are still a uniform black instead of the vibrant (and varying -- another GBC improvement) battlegrounds of Dragon Warrior I, and yet they share the same cartridge. To be fair, the original NES Dragon Warrior II had the same blah backgrounds (likely a space issue for the huge game, as DWI at least had limited visuals), but if ever there were a place to improve this game, it would be here. With a world map of something like four times the area (the original game's world map is but an island continent in this sequel), so much more time is spent travelling and brawling. You would think that at least there would be new sights to see at a given turn, but instead it's all dull black. This is particularly disheartening, because the Japanese SNES remake of Dragon Quest I and II, which uses character sets remarkably similar to what was squeezed into this tiny Game Boy cart, included dynamic visuals and even a few added cut-scenes which didn't make this version.     I can't call myself a connoisseur of the RPG, but it's certainly possible for me to fall deeply into a great quest. Maybe I might never have picked up a Dragon Quest had it not been for Nintendo Power's incredible give-away offer a decade ago for a free copy of the game with a subscription -- I like my games cranked up to eleven-- but I don't regret a single one of the two dozen hours spent with it, exploring the vast world of Alefgard in search of the nefarious Dragonlord.Console RPGs have changed vastly since those days, as they have harnessed the power and intensity of emotional resonance better than any other gaming genre. Some RPGs even contain the most visually arresting works of art in this field. These elements are not necessarily key to enjoying a role playing game, but they certainly help to engage the gamer, and have driven the genre to the mainstream.That's partly why Dragon Warrior is such an interesting artifact. It makes grasps for emotion and passion in moments, in an archaic and quaint manner. We'll never want to go back to Dragon Warrior as it was forever, but a short jaunt back on the Game Boy Color certainly is worth time spent. This version may have trouble pleasing its audiences -- classic gamer players will lament the changes, while new adventure players may find the quest overly non-linear and thinly drawn, but despite the disappointments and short-comings, it's an enjoyable quest. At the very least, it's one of the only interesting RPGs on the Game Boy Color to actually make American shores, and that counts a lot for a market begging for more adventure. Hopefully this, like the original games they stem from, is just a beginning.", "date": "Oct 4, 2000"}
