{"name": "Pearl Harbor: Zero Hour", "name_review": "Pearl Harbor: Zero Hour", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/07/09/pearl-harbor-zero-hour", "text": "When I first heard that the same engine from Airfix Dogfighter was being put to use in Pearl Harbor: Zero Hour, I knew that I was in for some concentrated gaming goodness. Airfix Dogfighter's great flight model and mission design scored big points with me and I was sure that, with the same setup, Zero Hour would captivate me just as much -- even more given that Airfix Dogfighter was one of the shortest games I've played in a long time. And as the switch from a domestic, toys-at-war setting to a slightly more realistic Pacific Theater setting was also intriguing, I prepared myself for hours and hours of fun and delight.  How many of you know where I'm going with this already?  Score two points if you've already realized that Pearl Harbor: Zero Hour is, in my humble estimation, hardly worth your time. The premise of the game is simple enough. You assume the role of a United States pilot during the Second World War. You'll battle your way across the Pacific in ten separate missions flying up to 14 different aircraft. Using a carrier or airstrip as your base, you'll choose your plane and set off in a mission to either blow up a ship or blow up an airfield -- sometimes both. For every target you destroy you earn points; once you blow up, you can use these points to buy new planes and continue the mission.  That happens a lot.   The planes are well chosen. Wildcats, Hellcats and Corsairs will battle it out with Zekes, Vals and Kates. You'll also be able to try your hand at the Mustang, the Thundebolt and the Lightning. The Devastator and Avenger fill the torpedo-bombing role, while the Flying Fortresses, Mitchells and Super Fortresses take care of your larger ground attacks.   Each plane is rated from one to four in each of four areas -- speed, armor, agility and fuel. There's plenty of difference between a plane with a speed of two and a plane with a speed of four. More important, however is your weapon loadout. Often you'll pick a plane because it's the only plane that carries torpedoes or rockets. Almost all the planes have some form of secondary armament so you won't be totally lost. Oh, there are also three hidden planes, but I'm not telling you how to find them.  So let's talk flight model. While the arcade model of Airfix Dogfighter was seriously limited, the model here is much more so. There are no rudder controls, only three settings for speed and no chance at all to cross over the Z-axis or to roll more than 70 or 80 degrees in any direction. These limitations, combined with the fact that you can only play the game in a top down perspective.  It gives the game a sort of a 1942 feeling but the fact that the game is in 3D and you can headlong into stuff gives it that added element of confusion and danger -- what I like to call confanger. As a further insult to your skills, the game doesn't require you to land after completing the final mission objectives -- you just move right on to the next mission. And when you do decide to land in mid-mission, the game provides giant landing rings for you to fly through to set up your approach. The game also handles all take offs on autopilot. Do we suck so bad that we need this kind of help?  With this arcade flight model, you'd expect a few more concessions to unreality. But for some reason they're not here. Some neat weapon power-ups would've really spiced things up (not to mention giving you the power required to take out the enemy's big ships without having to make eighteen different torpedo runs). The addition of other boosts and secret mission objectives might have increased the fun factor here.  As it is, you've only got basic weapons like guns, bombs, torpedoes and rockets. For the most part, these are pretty effective. But with the top down perspective, you'll have a hard time aiming your guns at enemy fighters. The game places arrows near each plane to show you how to pitch your plane in order to hit the enemy. Overall, it's a pretty crappy system that solves a problem that could've easily been avoided by placing the camera just behind your plane.  Perhaps the top-down camera was included to minimize the boxiness of the levels. Each mission takes place in a small square of ocean and/or land. The edges of the map give way to empty blackness that you can't fly in to. Hell, you can't even approach it without the game assuming control of your craft and turning you back to the action in an ever-so-graceful arc that leaves any enemies who might be tailing you an easy shot.  The missions start with two training missions set in Burma. From there you move past the Zero Hour of the title as you defend Pearl Harbor after the attack. Nice. From there you move on to Guadalcanal, Midway and the Solomons. The missions are thin and only use the historical battles as ~inspiration~ for a much more scaled-down version of events. This is fine as far as it goes, but the missions become far too repetitive far too quickly. By the time you've invaded Okinawa and bombed the Japanese Fleet of the shore of Japan, you won't really be all that interested in the outcome. Given the relatively shallow mission design I wonder why the developers didn't bother to add a Japanese campaign. Oh, or multiplayer.  A reenactment of the battle of Pearl Harbor has been included here. While it's interesting from a very superficial standpoint, it does little to enlighten you on the overall course of the attack. The reenactment is centered solely on Ford Island and the top-down perspective reduces the excitement that might otherwise be felt. The camera also tends to jump around from significant event to significant event that serves to disorient you further.  Simon and Schuster have also included a CD audiobook of the novelization of the movie Pearl Harbor. Randall Wallace penned the novel and Jay Sanders (of After M*A*S*H fame) provides the narration. While it's flaunted as a $24 value, I think that's being generous. Which brings me to another point. Why the hell is the game called Pearl Harbor Zero Hour when the Pearl Harbor attack is only one of ten missions that span the entire course of the War in the Pacific? Easy -- because there's money to be made with the movie tie-in (although the movie doesn't seem to be doing too well either).  All in all it's a pretty mediocre attempt to capitalize on the heightened visibility that the Pearl Harbor attack has recently enjoyed in the media. While the game is fun for about half an hour, it quickly grows tiresome due to the limitations of the flight model, the poor camera and the repetitious mission design. Some may rationalize these shortcomings as concessions to so-called casual gamers but I'm not buying it. Just because people aren't hardcore gamers doesn't mean you need to pander to them.  Somebody send me a copy of Aces of the Pacific. I need to fumigate my brain.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
