Up until the time I first inserted the disc into my Dreamcast I wasn't too familiar with Hidden & Dangerous. Sure I'd heard of it before, but never had I seen a single screenshot, movie, or demo of the tactical-sim in action. Not exactly my thing, tactical-simulations were a genre I hadn't touched since the days of X-COM (and only recently had tackled after a long hiatus in the form of Rainbow Six). The concept sounded very cool though; assemble a squad of World War II-era soldiers and pull off secret missions in the cover of darkness. All the while sniping people from hilltops and blowing structures to itty bitty smithereens. More intrigued by ~the olden days~ as a setting than the high-tech environments of Rainbow Six, I was more than ready to give the game a hearty sit down and see what it had to offer.  In the beginning, things start to look pretty hot. You're treated to a very intricate debriefing screen that goes over every possibility, and can watch as the compound you are set to infiltrate is mapped and studied. Selecting your commandos from a big list of Frenchies, Yankees, and Brits, you can peruse their histories and backgrounds and follow their statistics in a number of different categories. Some men are terrific at following orders but can't last in a fight. Other soldiers are crack shots but make a lot of noise when trying to be stealthy. This type of personalization of otherwise carbon copy recruits is actually pretty neat.  Once your brigade has been chosen (or if you like, chosen for you by the computer), you are able to select from among an entire armada of weaponry. Machine guns, pistols, grenades, land mines, and all types of death-dealing equipment can be plundered and taken on the mission with you. As you are limited in both supply and ammunition, selecting the right booty for the job is essential to capturing the victory. Men and equipment ready, it is now time to delve into your objective and fight for the allied powers!  Played in an almost identical way to Rainbow Six, your troops are dropped onto the battlefield with only each other and their small bag of goodies to rely on.  You must carefully (and quietly) place each soldier in a technically sound position on the map, switching back and forth from man to man, and proceed to systematically assassinate every German, many of whom will be undercover in the brush of a nearby tree, or hidden among boxes and supply crates.  And while a heap of levels require you to save prisoners, blow up enemy structures, or perform other such delicacies, all that it really boils down to is one thing: Shoot them before they shoot you.  Visually, the game is the next step over when compared to Tom Clancy's offering. Although the buildings and character models definitely need some improvement, the texture work and realistic animation is more than convincing. Not that the animation needed some bolstering in it's own it right. Real-world on a point-to-point basis, the actual speed and fluidity of the animated characters leave something to be desired. And even though little details like bullet trails and rain drops can earn the programmers some points in the graphics department, the constant glitches in scenery whenever there's a collision problem should have been fixed.  Speaking of collision problems, why are there so many? Constantly faced with more wall than space when making turns, I couldn't quite understand why my soldiers would randomly eat kilos of brick whenever I was indoors.  It isn't uncommon for one of the commandos to suddenly jerk himself backward, then forward at a wall in the middle of a surprisingly hyper spaz-fest - this is especially noticeable when running.  Another peculiar bug I stumbled upon involved laying flat on the ground with more than two people in close proximity to each other.  Towards the middle of level two in an underground tunnel, I had one soldier lying on the ground ready to fire when I moved my second man behind him in a squat position. I then decided to lay that second man down on the ground next to him and... CRASH! All of a sudden both men were sent hurtling through the tunnel's roof, above the complex's guard towers, and into the sky above. They died a screaming death of course, but there was nary a bullet, explosion, or any other sort of attack... just the weirdness of a strange programming glitch as the culprit.  Additional unfinished aspects of the game can also be found in the levels themselves. As sprawling, authentic, and complicated as they are, they appear to be a high point at first glance. But look deeper, and you'll be sure to find some glaring omissions. Outdoor areas are suddenly invisible hydroponics bays as you'll be running towards a structure or tree one minute, and then halted to a complete stop the next because of a see-through barrier. Mountains that appear to have trails leading down them at a believable angle become deathtraps without repose, as they transform into cliffs without any tangible borderlines. There were quite a few moments where I verbally questioned the play-testing of Hidden & Dangerous out loud... and I was by myself.  The pacing too needs some serious tweaking. One mission may drop you directly into enemy fire, forcing you to blast your way out of the jam. As you make your narrow escape and retreat to the other section of the level, you'll then proceed to do absolutely nothing for the next 20-30 minutes. Searching like an old man with a metal detector, your squad of freedom fighters will be lucky to find anyone or anything to help break the monotony. How many times do I have to run by this supply truck before something happens anyway?  On a positive note, the controls are much more intuitive that a certain other squad-based sim, and changing camera views and characters is a whole lot easier than I had experienced before.  The real bitch of it all however, comes in the form of climbing ladders. Easily the most difficult task in the game, ascending a ladder without pulling your hair out is nigh impossible. Why did it have to be such a pain in the ass to walk up to something and ~use it~, ~climb it~, ~manipulate it~, whatever! I just want to move up the blasted thing.  Don't misunderstand me, there are a lot of commendable little features inside Hidden & Dangerous. In the later missions, you can helm the controls of giant panzer tanks and surly gunboats. You can shout real-time commands at your cohorts and have them follow you, back off, move out... or do any number of various actions. German troops will command you stop in their native tongue and actually follow you through passageways, ducking for cover should you try and return fire. But after all is said and done, it just isn't enough to make it through the game's other shortcomings. Hidden & Dangerous is a lot better on paper than in reality. Certain positive aspects aside, there are just too many detractors to save this one from being anything but an average title. With your cash better spent on Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (or better yet, one of those classic X-Com computer games in your local PC bargain bin), the only thing that may be ~hidden and dangerous~ after a session of Talonsoft's latest, is you waiting for your local retailer to give you a refund.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 16, 2000"}
