Featuring over four hours of music and utilizing every conceivable instrument known to man (strings, flutes, percussion, brass, bells, whistles), Sakimoto does everything he can to bring his vision to life. Unfortunately, the work he envisioned isn't what we had in mind, and although it's probably not fair to compare him to Nobuo Uematsu (composer of the first eleven Final Fantasy titles), it's also inevitable, since the two FF music prodigies could not be more contrasting.While Uematsu's work is infectious and subliminal, blending into the gameplay experience seamlessly, Sakimoto's is over-the-top and bombastic. Many of the songs in this 4 disc collection could have been written by James Horner or John Williams, and are more appropriate for anything that begins with the word ~star.~ Sound like a good thing? It's not. The music is too invasive for a videogame, Sakimoto trying too hard to evoke emotion and driving a player to distraction. The traditionally simplistic character themes tend to go on way too long, wandering off the main road and nearly getting us lost, while the town tunes merely serve as pleasant background noise (think elevator music for Final Fantasy). That's a shame, because some of FF's most memorable tracks have been about towns and cities. Even the battle songs tend to be either too bland or too spicy. Luckily, all is not lost. There are a couple of hidden gems thrown into the mix, especially on disc 3. ~The Garifu Theme~ evokes images of long-dead Spartan warriors, while the exotic ~Ozame Plains~ conjures up the African Safari. ~Eruyt Village~ is soft and melancholy, but the vivacious ~Chocobo Theme~ is a good counter-balance to it. Disc 4 is also an improvement, though it tends to be more ~digitalized,~ as if Sakimoto went through his orchestra budget before he could complete the project. In any case, it still manages to be stirring: songs rise to a riveting crescendo, leading up to the ~Final Boss Theme,~ which incorporates previous melodies into one riveting compilation.The album ends with the game's vocal track ~Kiss Me Goodbye~ by Angela Aki, which is a warm, refreshing antidote to the album's rather glum overtones. Lyrics like ~don't shed a tear for love's mortality/you put the dream in my reality~ can't fail to give the heart a small tug. It's a strong end to a surprisingly trite collection, but maybe the fact that Nobuo Uematsu composed the song has something to do with it.Last but not least, this limited edition CD set features two bonus tracks (both heard in previews for Final Fantasy XII), as well as a nifty box and game booklet. They're a nice consolation prizes, but the additional songs are pretty short, and unless you're a die-hard collector, the box and book only serve to jack up the price of the album (close to a whopping $50).In the end, Final Fantasy XII's soundtrack, though at times rich and fluid, lacks the steady ebb and flow that makes previous FF albums so memorable. Final Fantasy music has always been a PART of the game; it wouldn't be Final Fantasy without it. Sakimoto's work acts like a separate entity, racing ahead and getting lost in its own little world. Too bad we can't keep up.Definitely Download:1. ~The Garifu Theme~2. ~Ozame Plains~3. ~Chocobo Theme~4. ~Kiss Me Goodbye~", "date": "Aug 2, 2006"}
