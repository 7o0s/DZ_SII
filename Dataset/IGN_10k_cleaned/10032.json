It seems like the house that Advance Wars or Nippon Ichi built has extended its influence to many other RPGs in the market  most recently, Heroes of Mana. When a console isn't the lead platform for a series, it's rare that a sequel can hold flicker of a flame to the original. Frankly, sometimes a series shouldn't tinker with the formula too much, for fear that it loses what makes it a part of that series.   That said, With Revenant Wings, it is clear from the opening cinematics onwards that a lot of time, effort and attention to gameplay mechanics was made for Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings. This is a completely worthwhile game in its own right and the production values and quality will surprise even ardent Final Fantasy purists  this reviewer admittedly included.   The first significant point of difference between Revenant Wings and something like Heroes of Mana is that this is a real-time strategy game. You're commanding masses of characters and Espers (summoned magical troops) is a furious sweeping cloud of action, rather than individually. This has two direct results  the pace feels much smoother and faster, and the need for micromanagement is lessened. That's a good thing in a lot of ways; for a portable adventure, the difficulty is lessened, the length of encounters is shortened and the complexity lies in prepping your squad before the battle, rather than making hasty decisions in the heat of the moment.      Taking place a full year after the events of Final Fantasy XII, the tale really does pick up the lead nicely. Starting off in the familiar landscape of Ivalice and the backstreets of Rabanastre, the game quickly shifts its location to an original landscape  the floating islands of Lemures, home to angelic beings beset by Sky Pirates and an influx of beasts. Vaan takes centre stage for much of the story, bringing along his sometimes-love Penelo and their gutter urchin companions. The tale quickly gathers momentum; you're piloting a new airship into unknown lands, but you're not amongst strangers. There are some excellent returning characters and cameos that will delight fans, while several major players return, losing very little in their diminutive sprite-form. As stories and dialogue go, this is trademark quality stuff, only occasionally drifting into cornball territory.   The DS' stylus is almost as precise as directing with a mouse on a PC screen. Essentially, you can either select troops en masse by dragging a selection rectangle around particular characters, or just grab them all with a tap of X. With 15 or so characters on screen at once, there is a lot to keep track of. That's made more difficult than it probably should be, since the DS' screen is only so large, and the resolution and height of the camera means that you're reliant on the map system. The top screen's map system is a little inadequate, given the size of each map. You can only really use it for an at-a-glance idea of the enemy's density, since you can't zoom in.   Before you delve into a mission, however, you should ideally outfit the right kind of squad. Thanks to a piece of crystal called Auracite (taken from the sacred Auralith) recovered from the first mission in the game, Vaan can summon Espers  magical beasts  to his team's aid. These are your reinforcements, each aligned with your typical Final Fantasy elements and usually drawn from past bosses, summons and Espers. By battling and collecting mineral elements, you can gradually spend your points on unlocking new Espers on a circular elemental grid, accessible before each mission. This system is reminiscent of past skill tables and trees  particularly those of FFIX and XII. The higher tiers of Espers have higher costs attached, while you're limited to placing the second and third tier Espers to just one slot each in your squad of five.    Although reduced to sprites, the cast still exude personality. Combat is also visually impressive.  You eventually increase your main character count too, allowing for greater skill variety. You have your typical tank-characters, healers, spellcasters and effects casters  but it is here that choosing the best possible Espers becomes key. By balancing the skills in your party, you can ensure you have plenty of revivers and healers during harder encounters, while you can focus on pressing through squads of enemies with your damage dealers. It's pure RTS stuff, with a Final Fantasy backdrop.   One area that many reviewers criticised was the apparent lack of difficulty in many of the game's missions. While it's true, you're rarely going to see a game over screen in most encounters, it's rarely a simple cakewalk experience. You can, if you want to, simply gang-bash your way through each squad of enemies (who only really start to advance as you come within a fair proximity of them), but you'll lose a lot of squad mates. It's also pretty much essential to pay attention to which Espers you've assigned and to who. You'll eventually start reaching squads of enemies who will out rank you and leave you hurting if you haven't done any missions outside of the core set.    The stylus sometimes has a little trouble differentiating between the characters and the landscape underneath them, which can be frustrating  but we found that scrolling the landscape and auto-selecting all of your squad was easy enough to adjust to. Summoning new Espers sometimes means drawing your attention away from battle and scrolling the screen back to a portal. Thoughtfully, there's a news-ticker that feeds the latest battle-actions back to you on the top screen while you're away from things. It's the little touches like this that set Revenant Wings apart from other DS RPGS.    Thankfully, the developer wisely included Tomaj's missions  a character who devotes himself from early on to tracking events that are occurring elsewhere in the floating isles. By completing these side-quests, not only do you gain valuable experience, but it fleshes out the story too. Also worth noting is the overworld experience. It's nice to return to an explorable overworld system  something that's been missing from the series for quite some time now. Piloting your airship over the continents and admiring the beauty of the landscape is a simple pleasure.   The engine display staggering levels of detail for the DS. Architecturally complex environments, such as sprawling, open temples with reflective floors and detailed textures are typical of the level of quality in Revenant Wings. The move from PS2 to DS has actually had a surprisingly small impact on the overall look of Ivalice  you still get the impression of a well-constructed kingdom before you, and the colour set is fantastic. The FMV cutscenes do run at a reduced framerate however, and those expecting the same level of quality in the character models may be a little disappointed by the rendering quality.   Holy smokes! That's DS? Outside of some occasional slowdown, the game will floor you.  The score, simply put, is as fine as it was in the PS2 version, barely reduced in midi quality. The score also adapts to your circumstances, changing dynamically to intense thrumming drums and strings during battles to more serene overworld themes and town scores when between encounters. The lack of voice-acting is noticeable, but unfortunately Square Enix didn't want to spring for larger and more expensive cartridge sizes this time around.   There are a few little control quirks and the camera perspective can be irritating, particularly when enemies are obscured behind pillars and walls, but there is still a polished and well-considered sheen to Final Fantasy: Revenant Wings that pulls this title to the front of the shelf for us. It has as much depth as we can ask for a true real-time RTS based in Ivalice, with some of the best production values this side of a first-party Nintendo release. It's good to be back in town once again.", "date": "Feb 15, 2008"}
