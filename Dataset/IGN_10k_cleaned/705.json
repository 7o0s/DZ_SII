Capcom's latest PlayStation fighter, a hybrid of Street Fighter and Marvel superheroes, Marvel Vs. Capcom, has a few exceptionally attractive points to it that lift it above the fray here and there, but I can comfortably say that in the end this one lands somewhere in the middle of road.   Gameplay With a truckload of main characters seen in various Capcom series to choose from, the Vs. series has built itself a respectable reputation in the arcades as being a skill-based fighter that highlights a variety of fighting styles and a high-energy combo impact. A great combination hit total ranges in the 30s-40s sometimes, and on a rather slow day, the average player can pound his opponent into the air with a casual 20-25 hit combos. Needless to say, the game is rife with overpowered, over-equipped fighters ready to smother the other guy.  One of the game's biggest draws is the now not-so-new tag-team aspect, seen previously in Marvel Superheroes Vs. Street Fighter. Players can pick a character in Cross Over, and the computer or your opponent chooses another, who then becomes your secondary character. While fighting, you can instantly switch from one character to the next, each maintaining his or her own Vitality and Hyper Combo Gauges. Unlike the coin-op version, players are limited to choosing one character here, because of the system's limited RAM capacity. While the character choices are limited here, the Cross Over mode is still a lot of fun. Using Partners and Special Heroes also has its firework-style effect, too.   The player roster is kind of deceiving. Players can pick from Jin, Spider-Man, Hulk, Zangief, Strider Hiryu, Megaman, Ryu, Chun Li, Captain Commando, Captain America, Wolverine, Gambit, War Machine, Venom, and Morrigan. While 15 characters seems like a small lineup, given the range of characters, it's actually quite hefty. With the Special Heroes and Partner Heroes selections, players can actually play the role of as many as 20-plus extra characters. Ranging from Storm and Ice Man to Jubilee and Onslaught, the game is far from shallow in selection.  Which is all good, right? I mean there is nothing that compares to punching it out with a friend in Street Fighter, especially if there are a bucket load of characters from which to choose. But Marvel Vs. Capcom employs a certain style of fighting that leans heavily on the flashing, seizure-type graphics, loads of projectiles, and the fancy-schmancy combos that don't always require that much skill. In this game, the mix and balance of skill isn't as good as it has been in previous Street Fighter games.   A certain amount of random button smashing weighs in quite heavily as a legitimate strategy here. I mean, take Gambit, War Machine, Jin, Captain Commando, Captain America, or ever Megaman, for instance. Smash a ton of buttons when you're somewhat close to your opponent and wham! You do serious damage. All sorts of crazy fireworks soar across the screen and you don't even know what you did. Hey! Not bad! Get a pro in there and the game is altogether different, but it's still easy to bombard him or her with a lot of cheap crap without having played that much of the game. I guess that's more a fault of the series than of this particular game, but it hasn't been improved here, which keeps Marvel Vs. Capcom from progressing the series.   While the character selection may be deceiving, Marvel Vs. Capcom's breadth of fighters is meager. I'm not talking about the variety and coolness of the cast, mind you, I'm talking about the style of fighters. There are essentially two, Ryu-style fireball hurlers and Zangief/Hulk crunchers. Yes, there are the occasional Wolverine and Chun Li exceptions, but they are far and few between. Street Fighter Alpha 3 lined up a ton of great fighters, with a broad range of styles, in one game without forfeiting a stitch of code or any lost frames.   Having said that, the golden cast of characters had me playing for hours and nights just trying to perfect the different ones, especially my favorites Strider Hiryu, Spider-Man, and believe it or not, the most amazing looking character in the game, Venom. For me the game is worth purchasing over several other Capcom fighters for the lineup alone. I mean, how cool is it to play Megaman against Venom? Or Captain Commando against the Hulk? Or Spider-Man vs. Ryu? Well, it's never be done -- except in this game. That's why this game is, in so many ways, priceless.   Graphics Capcom is rarely ever beat when it comes to animating gorgeous anime-style characters. Marvel is lucky to have Capcom reinterpret its characters because the level of detail and fantastical flair is unbeatable. This 2D fighter looks as good as the best Capcom 2D fighter on the system.   As for frame rates, the game is obviously not as fast as the coin-op system, perhaps behind a few frames here and there (OK, that's being nice), but it's not terrible like in the 16-bit days. With the exception of Street Fighter Alpha 3, I guess I've gotten used to seeing a few missing frames here in there in a Capcom fighter, and while it may deter the eye, it doesn't ruin the fighting, which is the most important aspect.   Sound Perhaps I've been in an anti J-pop mood for the last week, but this music is fricken' weak. The jumpy, flaring chirps and beats are just a little more than the average teenager should have to endure. Even the sound production is weak, with occasional crackles and chirps sending you in a search for a trapped bird somewhere in your house. Sometimes you hear a character's voice perfect, other times it's muzzled. It's not like Capcom's fighting games always have music that's 20 times better, but somehow this music struck me wrong every time the machine turned on. I think that this game, despite major flaws, is a keeper. The cast of characters is so damn good, and the team-ups and possible fight scenarios are just unbeatable. And don't forget that even though there are only 15 main characters to choose from, there are about 30 more who can come in as team-up characters. This roster is also filled with unexpected classic Capcom and Marvel characters. To me Marvel Vs. Capcom is an average game, but the lineup is golden. And for that I alone it's worth buying.", "date": "Feb 11, 2000"}
