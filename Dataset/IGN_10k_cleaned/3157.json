But five expansion packs later, it's clear we were right about the game's lasting appeal, as it's one of the few games which really deserves a perfect ten out of ten in that category.   And The Sims juggernaut rolls on. The original game no longer tops the PC charts, but that's because it's been replaced with this version, The Sims Deluxe, which we're reviewing today. Just make sure you realize that The Sims Deluxe isn't a new game. It's not a sequel, it's not even an expansion pack. Instead it's the original game, bundled together with the first expansion pack (Living Large, called Living it Up in the UK), with a few new extras thrown in. These extras consist of some skins, some new wallpapers and floors, a handful of new objects, and a utility for making custom Sims called Sims Creator.   So in that respect, there's not really that much to review here. The original game, The Sims, is basically the same here as it was back then. The game itself certainly deserves the high marks it received in our original review and there's little to add to that now. And as far as the inclusion of Living Large goes, that's probably a good thing, because it is easily the weakest of the expansion packs, offering little more than new objects and new skins, whereas later packs all added significant new game elements, from pets to vacations to downtown shopping malls.   So about all there is to cover are the new additions. What can I say about the Roman and Sci-Fi themes? I found these to be slightly lacking, consisting mostly of some new beds and other objects, a few skins, columns, and wallpapers, that can help give your house a different look. And while the quality is very high, as usually is the case for Maxis objects, they often fall back on that old technique of making slight color variations with the different wallpapers to increase the amount of ~new~ material available. These themes just aren't complete enough to completely makeover your Sims world -- Sci-Fi for example has some space-age looking chairs and beds, but your Sim Trekkers will still have to use 20th Century appliances for the most part.    Probably the most interesting thing in the package is the Sims Creator, which offers a fairly easy way for Sims newbies to create new skins and use photographs of themselves in the game. The program is slow and clunky though, and if you have lots of skins, scrolling through them is a painful process.    For the most part, everything that can be done in Sims Creator can be done with various third party tools as well, whether we're talking about something as simple as using PaintShop Pro or PhotoShop to create your own skins or going all out and using 3D mesh editors to make your own heads and body models. So in this respect, I found the Sims Creator to be a bit underwhelming, because if you know what you're doing you're going to get better results doing it on your own. On the other hand, I can see where this would be a useful tool for someone's who not very experienced with computers, who doesn't understand file organization, and who doesn't have a decent art program but is just stuck with MS Paint. I also like the 3D preview of The Sim you get to see in Sims Creator, it's a view with more detail and sharpness than you'll ever find in the game. The photo importer is pretty nifty too.   All in all though, there isn't enough here to justify picking it up if you already own The Sims and all the other expansion packs. On the other hand, if you're new to the world of Sims or buying the game for someone else this Christmas, Deluxe is a nice upgrade over the original offering, definitely the way to go.    So if you are shopping for The Sims this Christmas, remember that the game is very picky about what order you install the expansion packs in -- basically, if you buy a later one, install it, then buy an earlier one, you may in some cases have to go back and completely reinstall the game. And you don't want to do that. So here's the current order of all of The Sims releases.     The Sims Deluxe: This includes the original game The Sims and Living Large. You start with this.  House Party: New skins and themes, entertainers, and the ability to throw large parties in your house.  Hot Date: Many more new social interactions, focused on romance, as well as a whole new downtown shopping area.  Vacation: More interactions for kids and parents, as well as the vacation island resorts for extended (overnight) trips.  Unleashed: Adds pets to the Sims, as well as greatly increases the size of each neighborhood.    The bottom line is that if you're buying The Sims for the first time, whether for yourself or for someone else, you should definitely choose The Sims Deluxe.  But if you already have the original game and all or most of the expansion packs, you don't really need to pick up The Sims Deluxe, unless you're one of those people who absolutely must have every Sims release and Maxis product released, or you really, really want the Sci-Fi and Roman themes, and the Sims Creator. Please note that the scores I'm giving The Sims Deluxe are for the most part carrying given to the original game, since this is in fact a replacement for that game and not really something new.", "date": "Nov 6, 2002"}
