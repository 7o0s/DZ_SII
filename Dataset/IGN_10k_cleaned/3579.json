It's a more satisfying experience still when such a developer keeps afloat over the years, neither sinking from lack of success nor vanishing into the bowels of some monolithic, impossibly rich game producer.  Stardock Systems has impressed me on both counts, repeatedly producing games and Windows customization applications that please.  However, their efforts have never before placed them in the spotlight.  With Galactic Civilizations, they just might have their breakthrough product.  I've mixed reactions about some aspects of this 4x space strategy game, but at no point was I in doubt that it has a lot going for it.  Configure Yourself: While most 4x space strategy games let you choose your race and customize from there, you always play the humans in Galactic Civilizations.  This limitation is going to divide players.  I confess that I've never liked playing humans in strategy titles or RPGs.  (They smell funny.  They also make little sense most of the time, as even humans themselves will attest.)  I prefer the idea of selecting an exotic race with pre-figured strengths, weaknesses, and galactic relationships; and if you can adjust that race's strengths and weaknesses on top of everything else, as in Master of Orion II and III, all the better.  Stardock Systems says that many random events in the game rely upon your being human to make sense of it all, but from those events I've seen, racially generic ones seemed a distinct possibility.  That said, you can still customize your Terrans using ten points on twenty-four categories (including Diplomacy, Morale, Weapons and Speed).  You get to select the size of the universe, number of inhabitable stars, and basic winning conditions, as well.  Turning your opponents into mounted heads on a den wall is of course one time-tested route to victory, but Galactic Civilizations provides three alternatives.  Technological and Alliance Victories derive from SMAC (Sid Meiers' Alpha Centauri), while the Cultural Victory (Civilization III) sets out to convert opponent-owned stars into your own by cultural suasion.  Not only is it a nice mix of options, but you'll find that your AI enemies are quite adept at switching methods in midstream to whatever victory condition they can most likely achieve.  There are no multiplayer options; only one-to-five AI opponents.  Rather than receiving default personalities, each is rated along an RPG scale from ~pure evil,~ ~chaotic evil,~ ~neutral,~ ~chaotic good,~ to ~pure good.~  None of these terms means much in itself.  Put simply, the nicer a race's rating, the easier it is for them to eventually form alliances with other ~good~ races and help one another out, and the less inclined they are to immediately attack another race they encounter.  Morality also determines what high end technologies are offered to a race.  Very evil species can ultimately learn Advanced Slavery and Pain Amplifiers (for that extra bit of tasered morale), while extremely good species get Benevolence (boosts diplomacy) and The Better Way (boosts cultural influence).  However, I've played through a variety of conditions and games in more than eighty hours spent with Galactic Civilizations, and I've been threatened with war by ~pure good~ types who first ran across me.  They've also on occasion rabidly declared war on all other races that possessed a weaker military.  Evidently, being good in Galactic Civilizations doesn't prevent you from having a bad hair day as long as a solar year on Pluto.  (This leads to the question of your own moral barometer.  You start as neutral, but as you colonize planets, you'll be thrust into situations that demand simple multiple choice replies.  The standard good answer either reaps no benefit, or deducts from something the planet might otherwise offer you: a percentage loss to morale or a lower population limit, for instance.  The standard evil reply gives you a strong bonus, but moves you morally towards the evil side.  The neutral reply may provide no bonus or penalty, or something slight, either way.  Strongly good or evil is the way to go, as you'll get the same tech options that your good or evil opponents receive.  The interface colors change as well, in a move reminiscent of Might and Magic VII; so does the music.  It's a pleasant, if minor point.)  You can choose the level of AI for each opponent, as well.  This is an area I'll be covering separately later in the review.  Suffice to say for now, however, that even the ~below average~ choice can present a decent challenge to players with a few games under their belt.  Note, you can randomize both the good/evil spectrum and AI choices for an opponent, in which case the game doesn't reveal the results it generates.  Nice touch, that.  The Interface: Once in the game, you'll see a screen divided into four sections.  The right column consists of a galactic minimap, a mini-chart, and a news display.  The main section of the screen is a local 2D map, with a generic background of starry dust across a black sky.  Movement takes place from a flat, topdown perspective, in attractive, 1078 x 768 resolution.  Gaming conventions are respected: you left-click to select a ship (or anything else), and right-click to select a destination.  If the destination can't be reached in one turn, the ship will find the quickest path to its objective over multiple turns, pointing to the 22th century survival of either Mapquest or AAA.  Stars look like colored dimes, and ships are roughly the same size, all of which takes some getting used to.  The main screen and top two mini-screens each have their own series of buttons, as well.  For example, under the mini-chart, there are controls that display the relative influence, population growth, economic, military, manufacturing, and research might of each empire you've met.  Below the main are buttons (also available through F keys) that swap out the three mini-screens for a list of all your planets (with very basic information), or a list of all your starships.  The main screen itself can be swapped out for screens displaying Domestic Policy, Foreign Policy, or Research.  I personally prefer a full screen display of all my planets with more data than Galactic Civilizations furnishes, but the alternative has its merits.      Thumbs-up to Stardock Systems for finding easy-to-use remember groupings of controls, with tooltips that popup over every button.  This isn't an interface that imposes much of a learning curve on the new player.  Some of the interface choices are less then ideal, though.  Scrolling on the main map is a slow, tedious operation.  It's also difficult to relocate specific anomalies you may have briefly noted before, while your ship was on its way to something else.  And finding a ship that's on autopilot is difficult.  If you double-click on an autopiloted ship from your ship list, you get to watch it quickly move, before being rapidly pulled back to the last stationary main view.  You have to double-click on the ship list a second time, when the ship's move is completed, to bring it into view and keep it there.    Journey Forth Into the Unknown, Brave, Unfeathered Bipedals!: And so, your daring Earthlings (or, as Star Control's Spathi used to call them, Hunams) begin their galactic career.  They start with a single colony ship, and a survey ship.  The latter is for exploration, and assimilates space anomalies and debris, which exist everywhere in huge quantities.  These give you what amount to power-ups: small improvements to that ship's values, a minor economic enhancement, brief boost to research, etc.  I found this element of Galactic Civilizations all-too-similar to Neverwinter Nights' annoyingly endless chests-and-barrels-and-containers everywhere, replacing a genuine gameplay and rewards system with the constant search for small goodies.  Sure, a reward every now and then is fun; but all the time?  And just what happened to justify so much flotsam?  Some crackup on a ten-billion lane galaxy-wide speedway in the primordial past?  One of the seldom-seen varieties of galactic debris deserves specific mention: resources.  If you build a starbase (a relatively expensive ship available from the beginning of the game) and send it to one of these rare, geometrically-shaped little objects, you'll begin harvesting whatever bonus that particular resource provides: weapons, defense, even empire-wide morale.  This seems more like a board game feature than something appropriate to a computerized space strategy game.  Whoever heard of a mined item that automatically granted all your spaceships extra weaponry power, wherever they were?  Calling them ~weapons resources~ and ~cultural resources~ also seems too generic for a game that truly wishes to create and maintain a sense of atmosphere.  You'd think the races of the galaxy might come up with a better, unique term for each resource.  Another feature with a board game feeling ultimately presents a more serious problem of game balance.  These are the random events that can affect any player at any time, by they human or AI.  While some events are relatively mild in their results, others provide the kind of extraordinary boost almost guaranteeing a win to one side in the game.  As a typical instance, during an early point in one game I received a message: my race had discovered a Ranger dreadnaught.  Using it to destroy ships and blockade planets, I found it relatively easy to enforce my own peace terms with opposing empires I encountered.  I steamrolled my way to a boring, early win.  This is the kind of unbalanced event that shouldn't have been permitted (and there are more like it), while random events themselves should have been made optional, not mandatory.  Meanwhile, you'll want to send that colony ship in search of yellow stars, which are the only ones that possess planets of quality 15 and above.  Below that, you're find increasingly hostile environments that become difficult to develop and leave your people angry.  Curiously, all races want the same systems and worlds.  I find myself in turn wanting more game personality: planets with different atmospheres and gravities, rather than a single number to reflect good or bad.  I also desired more strategic options that affect colonization and diplomacy, such as a mix of races that prefer heavier, gaseous worlds, or airless rocks.  In Space Empires IV, this ability to share out the worlds of a given solar system among races that could use them was a strategic twist resulting in mutually beneficial alliances.  Once you colonize a planet, a screen appears that's startlingly reminiscent of the Civilization series, with sets of symbols representing production capabilities for military projects, social projects and research.  These and other aspects of planetary existence (morale, planet quality, etc) are augmented by constructing special planetary social projects.  (Again, as in the Civilization series, you can use your social project queue to build a ~Wonder~ that's the only one of its kind in the universe.  An example is the Galactic Exhibition, which increases your empire-wide cultural influence by 10%.)  There's also a ship queue, where you can construct any ship you've already researched.  Want to finish a ship or social project early?  There are several ~banks~ willing to give you the needed cash in exchange for annual payments.  Each offers a different rate of interest and payment schedule.  Keep a close eye on your empire's galactic credit, though.  It's easy to incur too many debts early in the game, when cashflow is still poor.  Domestic and Foreign Policy, Research: The Domestic Policy screen is actually a series of screens you can tab through.  It provides access to your empire's trade routes and current stats (modified by resources and projects), alter the tax and spend rates, and rebalance the sliders controlling military-to-social-to-research spending.  You also use it to set your form of governmenta Civilization feature that involves trading off decreasing planetary morale for quicker production rates.  Planets can revolt, joining other empires if your approval rating drops too low.  Galactic Civilizations doesn't provide planetary governor AIs to optionally control individual planets: micro-management is the name of the game, here.  But you can create four governor templates that contain lists of your known social projects, in any order you choose.  Subsequently, after colonizing a new planet, you select the governor you want, and the template building order is applied.  Of course, you're free to interrupt the process anytime you wish.  It's a simple but elegant solution to the inadequacy of so many planetary AIs, and less annoyingly invasive than the governor AIs in Master of Orion III.      Foreign Policy, like Domestic, is actually a series of tabbed screens.  It displays the basic relationships you've established with the five other major powers in the universe, those stats you know of every other player, and a diagrammatic relationship of the treaties/war status of the big six.  There's a separate screen to contact Galactic Civilizations' so-called lesser raceswho may or may not show up in any particular game, can't be allied with anyone, and may eventually include a powerful empire if enough demoralized planets defect to form their own independent league.  I really, really like that last bit, and have observed instances during play where such a league actually destroys dominant galactic empires.  There's another tab that lets you observe those laws being currently enforced by the United Planets.  This is less of a parliamentary body than a sort of Monopoly-derived Chance card.  Every now and then, the UP screen pops up, showing a proposition that may upset game balance, and upon which all the races you've met plus yourself must vote.  Size of vote depends upon population.  I find it annoying because there's clearly nobody arranging the legislative agenda.  They're selected at random; and for me, that breaks the illusion of reality underlying the game.  I'd much rather have the kind of governmental body that actually has a strong strategic part to play, as in Master of Orion III or Alpha Centauri, where any member can press a bill to its advantage and the detriment of its foes.  Fortunately, unlike random events, this feature can be turned off.  Research is one of the most cleverly designed elements in the game.  Each separate tech screen follows a simple pattern that gathers all pertinent information at a glance: new social projects the tech provides in the upper left, new starbase modules in the upper right, military projects in the center, empire-affecting abilities on the bottom left, and new research options on the bottom right.  You also get a brief but useful technology summary, and a colored icon that reflects which of the six basic tech types (weapons, propulsion, defense, diplomacy, industrial, medical/environmental) an individual tech belongs to.  The interrelationship of these tech types is well-conceived and complex.  The only problem I have with the system is the lack of a printed tech tree foldout.  You can view the complete tech tree on a separate screen by loading the Survival Guide from the Galactic Civilizations' pre-game menu, but the thing's so large that it's impossible to see in detail without extensive scrolling.  A printed foldout would have solved that, or an extensive in-game Encyclopedia with a search function.  (You could look up a tech inside Alpha Centauri, and see at once what branch of research was needed to learn it.  Multiple branches might be necessary in Galactic Civilizations, but it still could have been handled with relative ease.)  Missing in Action: Stardock Systems has made a good case on its website for not wanting to be judged by the gameplay systems it hasn't included.  Hell, I've repeatedly made that case myself over the years, even for products I didn't like; and I like Galactic Civilizations.  It makes sense to critique anything for the success or failure of what it sets out to achieve, not the absence (and automatic failure) of some other, unintended goals.    That said, there are a series of gameplay expectations surrounding any game genre.  You would expect a flight simulator to include multiple scenarios, and a fantasy CRPG to offer enchanted weapons, armor and items.  If these expectations were not met by a new game, you would want to know about it from reviews, since it stand to reason that the developers are not going to list on the game box those elements of gameplay that were explicitly outside their concerns.  Turn-based, 4x space strategy games come with a series of current player expectations, as well.  Among the current player expectations for turn-based, 4x space strategy games are some form of starship building from components, and tactical combat.  Neither of these are present in Galactic Civilizations.  The joys of constructing a new spaceship from a host of separately researched parts (at least engines, shields, and weaponry of varying quality) is missing from the game.  You research a certain kind of ship that comes with preset attack and defense values, and a number of hit points.  Over time, ship units that survive combat gain levels, affecting further combat.  There's no such thing as upgrading ships, though you can research techs that automatically increase attack, defense values, and hit points for all the ships you own, no matter where they are.  Combat itself is more like the Civilization series than anything else: you click on an enemy, your ship moves next to it, and fire is exchanged until one loses all its hitpoints and explodes in an unimpressive little animation.  Stacking ships or maneuvering multiple stacks around any enemy for a massed attack gives you no strategic bonus.  Stardock Systems is entitled to deliberately leave these ship customization and tactical combat out of Galactic Civilizations, but I personally find the results lacking in some core aspects I've come to expect from the genre, however good much of the remainder is.  There are other features whose absence is less individually noticeable, but still disappointing when considered as a whole.  For example, while the Foreign Relations screen allows you to trade a ton of goods (researched techs, colonized worlds, cash, trade specials, ships) with an opponent AI, there are very few of the pacts you'd normally expect from this kind of game.  You can't create treaties that provide mutual benefits to research or espionage, and the only economically beneficial arrangement you can make has nothing to do with diplomacy.  (You simply send a freighter to an AI-owned planet to establish a trade route.  That you can do this automatically to an opponent who views you with an attitude bordering on fangs-dripping hostility seems unrealistic.)  You can request one player attack or make peace with another, just like Alpha Centauri, and you can make a full alliance; but there's no preliminary defensive alliance, much less the ability to form temporary group alliances suited to a single purpose (like wiping out a universally detested rival), as in Europa Universalis.      The sneaky among us (and according to the latest surveys, that's everybody) will also be dissatisfied at the primitive treatment afforded spying.  Other similar, recent games from Imperium Galactica II to Master of Orion III have provided spies with both special areas of expertise and RPG-style statistics that influence their success.  They could specialize in destroying buildings, steal techs, etc.  They could also be captured, interrogated, and potentially end up as double agents.  None of this exists in Galactic Civilizations, which only offers you the uninspiring and antiseptic option of spending money directly on espionage and/or destabilization.  You can't even develop a corps of counter-agents to prevent your own destabilization.  When another race does this to your culture, your only recourses against plummeting morale are to lower taxes, research morale-enhancing techs, and blast the offending cheese mites out of existence.  AI, the Next Frontier: I've come to expect great AI from Stardock Systems ever since first reviewing Entrepreneur in 1996.  Simply put, they do some of the finest gaming AI I've ever confronted, and Galactic Civilizations is no exception.  On an average setting, the AI explores, colonizes, researches, produces and deals with its neighbors very efficiently, despite receiving no bonuses.  It'll give you more than a run for your money, and makes consistently reasonable choices that will leave you thinking it's really another human (probably a midget named Vincenzo) squeezed into your CPU.  One of the reasons for this uncannily canny AI is that, like the Chessmaster series, it continuously runs in the background.  While you're considering your move, the other empires are evaluating theirs.  As a side benefit, there's hardly any delay between turns when the AI traditionally thinks.  Even when there are a field of evil AIs fighting one another, with dozens of ships maneuvering all over the galaxy, turns proceed swiftly.  That's not to say the AI is perfect.  It has its share of bugs.  For example, I discovered that whenever I was approached by an AI demanding cash and techs under the threat of war, refusing the demand and following up with a fair trade, instead, completely removed the threat for quite a while.  In fact, in one case, the threatening AI (and it didn't like me, at all) actually took my offer of a single decent tech, and gave me two of equal value, plus three spaceships that were above my current capabilities.  Twice, too, I found that an empire at war with me backed my case when a random United Planets event occurred that would have hurt me if the bill had passed.  The other empire AIs, relatively friendly (according to my foreign relations screen), voted against me.  Given the job Stardock has done thus far on the AI, though, these bugs are likely to be caught and sprayed into non-existence within a relatively short period of time.  Some of the rules the AI abides by might require some adjusting, as well.  I noticed that even during wartime, AI players seldom send out military convoys to accompany traders, which can lead to a serious loss of revenue when an enemy attacks.  (While it's true that convoys aren't an automated feature, they can be performed manually.)  The AI also never appears to colonize any planet with a rating under 16, despite the early presence of social projects that can quickly boost planetary ratings.  No doubt this is because the AI perceives other social projects as higher on the agenda, but it results in marginally slower AI than human colonization during the vital early period of the game.  The more planets rated at 14 or 15 around the AI, the more they'll tend to fall behind as they search from something better.  This needs to be addressed.  Breaking the Mood: I've already mentioned a couple of aspects of Galactic Civilizations that seem more appropriate to a board game, and disturb the carefully crafted illusion of reality: the generic resources, the endless space anomalies that furnish goodies, the Chance Card-style United Planets.  The animations for the major races in the diplomatic screen are no better.  Slow, repetitive head movements are as bad as static images.  I find the attempts at humorous dialog during the game very off-putting, as well.  When an evil-by-default race has been reconfigured as good, it's still not going to offer hugs over an interstellar communications channel.  Similarly, if any race is losing heavily in a war with you, it's going to take the matter seriously, and not make stammering jokes.  I like humor as well as the next person; certainly better, if they're the kind that wears suits in ninety degree weather and goes door-to-door, trying to sell bibles.  But humor, like every other integrated element in a game, shouldn't be at the expense of the reality the developers are striving to create.  The humor in Galactic Civilizations goes for the quick laugh, and sacrifices the thrill of submerging the player in the gaming experience.  What did you think of Gal Civ?  By contrast, the music is generally effective, though the best tune, a New Agey kind of thing, is associated with the pre-game menu.  The main game theme is an optimistically martial melody (those Terrans, again) that quickly becomes annoying, but changes when your empire's morality goes saintly or sociopathic.  You can also customize the game to play other musical sources on your computer. Galactic Civilizations has a lot going for it.  Though I don't like the animations, the graphics are clean, spare and attractive.  The interface is a breeze to learn, and it takes next to no time to get into your first game.  There are four optional ways to win, with a new universe configured every time you play.  The excellent tech tree excels in forcing you to make hard choices, while the AI is superb, despite my expressed concerns.  As against this, there are aspects of Galactic Civilizations that make it feel more like a strategic board game about outer space than a computerized 4x space strategy game.  Features, major and minor, that have become standard for some time in the genre, are missing.  Finally, there are unbalancing random events that can bring any session to a screeching halt.I've heard some comparisons invoked with Master of Orion III.  MOO3 is a macro-management game that attempts many new things (and does a damn fine job of it, despite poor player feedback and an awful game manual).  By contrast, Galactic Civilizations is a micro-management game that combines interesting features from select past games. If anything, Galactic Civilizations is much more like MOO2, despite the latter's age. Both are 2D products seen from a top-down perspective. Both feature primitive espionage, and newsbots reporting random events. There are obvious differences, but far greater similarities in their respective gameplay elements. Galactic Civilizations undeniably furnishes a greater challenge thanks to its AI (never Simtex's strong suit), but MOO2 still gives a greater visceral thrill. The former provides the sharper game, while the latter furnishes more excitement thanks to tactical combat and component-based ship construction. I guess you could say that the armchair strategist and unrepentant boardgamer in me really enjoys Galactic Civilizations, while the RPGer prefers the sense of addictive involvement that remains a hallmark of MOO2. The division isn't of course completely clean cut, but it's still there.Despite these reservations, Galactic Civilizations remains a strong playing experience. Whatever it attempts, it generally does well, and where AI is concerned, moves to the head of the class. It lacks innovative imagination, but provides a solid gaming experience and a challenge that never fails.", "date": "Apr 8, 2003"}
