Granted, few (if any) ever succeeded at harnessing the power of whatever platform they appeared on like RenderWare creators Criterion, but there were certainly a couple of passable efforts. World Championship Paintball, however, is not one of them.    In fact, it's one of the worst games released in quite a while, and though I don't normally do this, I'm really going to avoid going into more detail than is necessary. Given that it's basically my job to play the crap games that nobody else in the office can stand, it's no surprise that I'm stuck prattling on about games that barely make it to tolerable status but quite literally nothing about WCP is worth experiencing.      That paintball is apparently becoming popular enough to warrant multiple titles in the genre is a good sign, but when the surprisingly accomplished Greg Hastings Tournament Paintball Max'd does everything that WCP tries to do -- including offering a full tournament schedule, upgrades for you and your teammates, and a bevy of officially licensed gear to hopefully give fans of the sport a tie to the real world -- but does them with more flair, more tangible results and a presentation that doesn't seem bargain bin right from the get-go.   I just don't have the energy or interest to get into how sluggish the controls are, how hard it is to not only draw a bead on someone but actually hit them (even with equipment that supposedly boosts your accuracy and firing rate) or how mind-numbingly boring the voices, music, and progression throughout the tourneys are.    It's weirdly draining just playing the game, partly because it's so incredibly lackluster in nearly every department, from the piss-poor visuals with completely flat lighting and low-res textures to the limited animation to the bland interface right on through to the comatose announcers and players that clearly have never experienced the actual rush of a real paintball game. Team commands are all but pointless because matches feel like free-for-alls (yet it's never really clear where shots are coming from). The online modes are Tumbleweed Town (and rightly so). The -- you know what? Forget it. It's not worth getting into any more detail on.I can't help but see World Championship Paintball as anything beyond an obvious attempt to cash in on the general interest of paintball as a sport. Unfortunately, at no point does the game ever feel like it channels the intensity, chaos or appeal of the real thing. The game is an ugly, pointless waste of shelf occupying space, and the $20 THQ is charging would be better spent on an hour or so of real paintball at your nearest course.
