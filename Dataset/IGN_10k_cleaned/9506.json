Rushed, buggy, uninspired, it's rare that a game can both capture the essence of the license and offer up some enjoyable gameplay as well. Somehow Napoleon Dynamite: The Game from developer 7 Studios avoids the pitfalls of most licensed minigame collections and delivers a product that's surprisingly polished and occasionally as inspired as the film it's based on.    The game's story is largely a rehash of the film, with some extra plot points thrown in to motivate Napoleon to wander around town, thus unlocking the game's twenty-five minigames. In typical minigame fashion, the player must complete each game (to this third difficulty level) before unlocking the next area and next batch of games. Along the way, Napoleon encounters familiar characters from the film and gets himself into wacky situations like accidentally releasing his grandmother's llama Tina.    The game has a very distinct visual style, meant to emulate the scrapbook look of the film's posters, DVD covers and Napoleon's crude classroom sketches. The game is bright and colorful and while it hardly pushes the limits of the DS, it does a nice job of capturing the spirit of the film. Some of the characters and animations are surprisingly funny, such as when Tina the llama shakes and moans each time she catches casserole in her mouth. Cutscenes use a paper doll approach, converting Napoleon and his friends into big-headed scrapbook versions of themselves. Artistically this is a very smart approach to the game, as it almost requires shoddy, rushed-looking artwork. It's as if Napoleon is designing these games in his trapper keeper with sketches and magazine cut-outs, so when a dog and a cat in one game are completely out of proportion from one another, it makes sense.    Dialogue doesn't translate as well, unfortunately. Although the writing accurately captures the voice of the film's characters, reading the word ~sweet~ isn't nearly as funny as hearing Napoleon utter it. Text scenes are surprisingly bland with a wrinkled text box of paper on the bottom screen and often nothing on the top screen. The game features still image cutscenes as well, but I can't help but think though how much more engaging these could have been with just a little bit of animation. Some simple, paper-doll movement of Napoleon and his peers would have greatly elevated the comedy and made these scenes worth watching, instead of skipping.    The twenty-five minigames in this collection range from rhythm games to combat, space shooters, sports and many other oldschool arcade genres. Some of the games are button control only, some touch only with most offering the option of either. With few exceptions, the control scheme in each game is kept mercifully simple, making some of these games as enjoyable as the arcade classics they take inspiration from. A pet peeve of mine in DS games is when, especially in shooters, the action and enemies span across both screens but the player is only allowed to inhabit the bottom one, usually without any rationale for this. Thankfully, most of the minigames in this collection that span across both screens offer full dual-screen mobility for the player. Sure, the player will want to keep to the bottom screen most of the time anyway, but it's always nice to have options.    The development team has to be commended on the quality of the programming in this game. Although the minigames are all pretty shallow and played for laughs, they've got very tight controls and excellent balancing. When Napoleon is flying through space on his unicorn, firing arrows and rainbow explosions at fighter jets and laser-equipped dolphins, it's a laugh but it's also one of the better space shooters to hit the DS.    That's not to say that this collection isn't without its gameplay flaws. Dodgeball for example feels a little poorly thought out. In it the player controls both Napoleon and Pedro in a game against two other students. The game ends if both Napoleon and Pedro are hit too many times. However, the player can only control one character at a time, and the other character's AI doesn't do much to dodge incoming balls. When Napoleon is dragging his toys behind the school bus in another game, the player is warned to avoid cats and dogs. Later however, cows are fine to hit while tool benches are not. A few of the games suffer from unclear components, due in large part to how eccentric the game is. These are more design issues than programming ones, however, and once the player learns a game it can be played reliably.    After each minigame, a score card lists player accuracy, points, medal earned, high score and per-round achievements. This feels a bit like overkill in a game where the player will be paying more attention to the art and characters than their leet gaming skillz, but it's all wrapped up in a single post-game screen and isn't intrusive.    Music in the game does a good job capturing the laid back feel of the movie and carries a real sweetness to it, even if there are actually very few songs here. Audio is strangely absent in some areas, such as menus and some of the cutscenes. On the plus side, the game features frequent one-liners from Napoleon and Pedro, and some surprisingly funny sound effects.    The game offers two difficulty settings: normal and hard, with hard unlocked after playing through the normal setting first. There are a few extras modes that can be unlocked by playing through the game. The player can dress characters up in unlockable costumes (it's a shame these selections don't affect the cutscenes), view their scores and medals, re-watch cutscenes and mess around with unlockable trinkets. None of these extras are very engaging, but with twenty-five enjoyable minigames in here already, this package is fairly robust.7 Studios really nailed the license on this game. Although the presentation is as times a bit bland, the minigames are generally well done and capture the spirit of the film perfectly. This isnt the best minigame collection on the DS, but its better than most. Diehard fans of the film will probably enjoy this collection, and gamers looking for some enjoyable, bite-sized gaming might be surprised by what they find here.", "date": "Nov 14, 2007"}
