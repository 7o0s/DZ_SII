Strange as that may sound, that's exactly the premise of Bandai and Cyber Connect's latest super project known as .hack//INFECTION (Part 1). A bizarre, futuristic experiment that takes place in the not-so distant future, .hack is about as enjoyable as it is unique, and for the first time in quite some years, shows ingenuity on the RPG front. Even if it is more gimmick than gameplay.   Story  It's difficult to describe what's going on in the .hack universe without revealing a ton of plot-centric secrets and story twists. A 35-part episodic adventure that spans novels, anime, and videogames, .hack is a complicated tale of mystery, deceit, and shocking revelations (and let us not forget the new .hack anime series known as DUSK that begins several years after the events of the final videogame), that take paranoia and the supernatural to new levels of extremity. Invest all the time required in .hack in order to truly absorb it all, and you could have yourself several months of busy research.   INFECTION (Part 1) takes place near the end of the long-winded tale and still manages to tell you a whole lot of nothing. Beginning with a clever tutorial that teaches you the game's mechanics and play systems, you'll soon find out that this isn't an ordinary RPG at all. As the revolutionary premise of the experience is that your main character is he, himself, playing an online Role-Playing Game known as The World. After a sudden attack on his friend Orca while confined within The World, your character Kite is startled to learn that Orca has fallen comatose in real life as well. Baffled as to why such a thing has happened, Kite must travel back into The World and find out what really happened. It's from this point that .hack truly begins.    Saying anymore would be a disservice to the players who are interested in it, not to mention a fruitless exercise in confusing the casual reader. Designed as a segmented collection of units to be revealed in four parts (there are three more videogames coming our way before the end of the year), there are several loose ends and mysteries that are formed and created throughout the experience that is .hack. Needless to say, the plotline is very adult, very well thought out, and entirely baffling (and that's a good thing).    Offline or Online?  The World plays like a typical online RPG should -- with hub cities that serve as meeting grounds for various players, item shops, armories, and gates that work as portals to the adventure portions. If you've played EverQuest or similar games in the genre, you should already be familiar with the ~safe city/dangerous wilderness~ ideal of .hack and in this instance it works pretty well.   What makes the hub cities really entertaining are that the other ~human~ players that are the server speak very much like other sentient beings would. Insults, idle banter, and general chitchat litter the field at any given time and other than the occasional repeat sentence, are pretty convincing (it can take in upwards of 10 conversations before language is repeated, very impressive).   To further add to the online motif, you can treat the supposedly real people as you would in reality. Adding players to buddy lists to form parties, item trading, bargaining, and several other human traits have been incorporated to make .hack as similar to a real MMORPG as possible. You can even post on the in-game message board system or communicate with emails. And though the text of your posts is already pre-determined, the function alone adds enough believability to make you think twice the next time you participate in character conversations.   It's a bit unfortunate, though, that the characters that aren't intrinsic to the storyline were given almost no personality; though they react and sound human to varying degrees, they all interact with your character in the same cookie-cutter way: Reply, reply, shoot the breeze. It would have been so much more refreshing if some of them spoke in all capital letters, never used punctuation, used shortcut words instead of full sentences, or went around player killing or stealing.    We realize that's generally considered a bad thing when playing online for real, but it would have been an awesome touch to throw in for a game that's only pretending to use the Internet. Ah well, at least we get smiley faces and winks -- which is a whole lot more than we expected in the first place.    Gameplay  .hack is a beast that tries to be as different as possible while still maintaining an intuitive-enough feel to keep the traditionalists happy. The equipment and status menus have made the cut, complete with things like magic spells, items, elements, party commands, and all sorts of other stuff that swords and sorcery fans can feel at home with. The character classes aren't quite as familiar though, with words like Blade Master, Twin Blades, and Wave Master replacing fighters, rogues, and magicians. There other differences between the classes too, like special skills, armor restrictions, and the like, but we'll leave that up for you to discover.   Interestingly enough battles are fought in real time rather than turn-based, allowing gamers to pull off as many hits or attacks as they can muster in-between the assaults from their enemies. The trade-off in such a system is that if you've tapped the button 30 times in a one-minute period, chances are only 10 of those shots will have landed. It's this variable that helps promote level building, upgrading, and player trading as the game progresses, and ensures that the game will have to be mastered on two fronts: One in terms of player statistics and numerical values, while the other resides with combat timing and technique.   Luckily you'll have members of your party that can help you for the tougher fights, and though you can't control them directly, you can instruct them to help out in the manner in which you see fit. Should you want the team to act as healers, warriors, or somewhere in the middle, a simple press of the command button sets you right up. Though admittedly, there's little difference we've seen between the balanced request and warrior request. Perhaps that shade of gray is just too similar for its own good.    Now and again, players will have the opportunities to partake in special kinds of battles that allow them to do things they normally wouldn't. Known as Data Drain contests, it's a method to rewrite the data of your opponent, lower their level, and defeat them for rate items or Virus Cores (which are used for Gate Hacking into otherwise forbidden areas). Battles in which you have the opportunity to Data Drain are always harder than the rest of your conflicts, and aren't always successful (mess up and one of your levels could go bye-bye).    The combat system works really well when the opportunities arise, but there are a couple of gripes we have that need addressing. The first of which is the experience system -- it takes awhile to shoot up the levels you want to, with little chance at becoming more powerful unless you purposely wonder the servers looking for extra battles.   And while I love to dungeon crawl with the best of them, the low enemy-count and list of forbidden servers makes it difficult to pull off. Also of note is the wonky camera; which requires you to manipulate the perspective on your own rather than follow the action intelligently. And while it provides plenty of freedom and customizability, it can prove to be a bothersome problem when faced with quick-footed enemies in the tight spaces. Sometimes creatures you can't even see will hit you.   Another issue that could prove problematic is the length of the adventure. Over and done with in just about 25 hours, .hack is much shorter than the typical RPG experience. Granted, INFECTION comes with a 45-minute DVD and the promise of three more games before year's end, but 25 hours is still pretty short for a game of this type. Though they're immensely entertaining while they last.   Graphics  Cyber Connect's latest effort not only plays like a real online RPG, it looks like one too. As the genre is typically known for its vast object-anemic overworlds and to-the-point dungeon exploration, so to is .hack. Broken into a number of different environments and sections, the somewhat-randomly generated areas are very much similar to that of the early EverQuest titles (albeit with slightly better textures). The simple color-based plains, rocks, and natural formations change shape and look as you progress throughout your adventure and the added weather effects are a nice touch.    Dungeons fit the same kind of description with the only changes worth mentioning being the various shades of green, purple, and red that infests the walls in each. They're all pretty non-descript really, but not to the point of being terribly boring or uneventful, they're just kind of ~there~. Story-specific sections fare much better with its architecture, sporting some terrific looking statues, pillars, sculptures, and stained-glassed windows. Then again, that's how most online RPGs usually fare in the visual department, so .hack follows the template perfectly.    Where INFECTION really stands out, though, is in terms of character design. Developed by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (known the world over for his contributions to Neon Genesis Evangelion, Nadia, and The Wings of Honneamise), the splendidly realized personalities are some of the best we've seen (They're up there with Guilty Gear X2). Unfortunately as we mentioned in the Gameplay section, .hack suffers from some pretty severe camera problems, and for reasons already discussed, should have been built on the 'smart camera' ideal rather than 'full control'. The game would have flowed a lot more eloquently.   Sound  If there's a single shining star in the entire audio category, it's the option to listen to the original Japanese vocal track. The first role-player I can ever remember that has given the user the choice to play in either language, .hack signals I hope, the beginning of developer realization for the old adage ~If it ain't broke, don't fix it.~ Even so, the English voiceovers aren't too bad in their own right and reach the expected quality of typical American dub-jobs. For those of us who can understand even the least bit of Japanese, however, it's rather obvious that the original Nihongo track is by far the superior mix.   Every positive note comes with a price however, and the payment for receiving the original Japanese track may disappoint Japanese-speaking fans that held off of picking up the import. Originally included on the Japanese disc, a special ~humor~ track that made fun of situations and characters has been omitted completely. For the majority of North American gamers, though, this isn't too big a deal -- as the humor track was exclusively in Japanese anyway.   Musically, .hack is mostly positive, with a bevy of excellent theme work and orchestral bliss that equals the efforts to that of most high-profile RPGs. Granted there are few stinkers located in various spots throughout the game (most notably the random EXP-only dungeons of Theta server), but that's common of just about every videogame these days, and .hack pleases more than it disappoints..hack//INFECTION (Part 1) is a far from perfect take on the now-populated RPG genre that does have a couple of issues. It's short, it's not very difficult, and the camera manipulation needs a whole lot of work. If you can accept those problems, however, then there's a ton of gameplay just waiting to admit you. After all, clever story twists; excellent character design, and an addictive gameplay engine can go a long way. The ability to save your progress when it's all over and import your file into the next chapter of the story known as MUTATION is a great bonus too.More than anything, .hack is a good looking, audibly impressive, and pleasurably fun experience. It's a great package with plenty of positives to attract RPG aficionados and futuristic sci-fi fans alike and a terrific way to pass your weekend away.
