The company established its hard-core gaming image with ballsy, challenging titles with gritty designs and unforgettable gameplay. Streets of Rage. Eternal Champions. Sonic. As far as I'm concerned, those were some of the best days for gaming ever - and it gives me great pleasure to announce that Jet Set Radio marks the illustrious rebirth of that old-school Sega image. Jet Set Radio breaks through genres, takes no prisoners, and has honest-to-god attitude (yeah, the same cheesy buzzword that's plastered onto every animal-mascot game released). This is a game that beats you down, and kicks your ass repeatedly with a pair of cleats. And if you're a real gamer, you'll gobble it up and beg for more.  Jet Set Radio takes place in a futuristic proto-Nippon hybrid called Tokyoto, where rival skate gangs express themselves through the slightly illegal art of graffiti. Your crew is the GGs, a group of too-hip-for-you youngsters whose home turf is the sunny paradise of Shibuya. But the keisatsu (read: the fuzz) aren't content with letting a bunch of rapscallions deface the city - they've deployed the pistol-packing Police Chief Onishima to disperse some leaden justice on any possible perpetrators.  While the action on the street is hot, the airwaves are kept ice-cool thanks to the help of Professor K - a dredlocked DJ who runs a pirate station called Jet Set Radio. The good doctor hits the wax and gives you an update on the storyline after each level, letting you know what's up with the keisatsu and the epic clash of the skate gangs.  So here's what you do: to gain control of an enemy gang's territory, you skate on in and paint the town red. The game fires off with a quick tutorial, where a gang girl named Gum teaches you the basics of dashing about and making your mark. By the end of this training sequence, the average player will be able to pull off trickage that would make Tony Hawk wet himself. The developers have made it simple to execute spine-tingling maneuvers - you can grind on almost every surface in the game, from fences to curbs to power lines. Leaping out of a grind at a high speed does a head-over-heels trick, and gives you a speed boost over any pursuers. Clever gamers will figure out how to ~skitch~ off the backs of moving cars, or skate backwards for double the style.  And then you've got the graffiti. Red arrows mark the spots that have to be sprayed - you need to paint from ten to twenty locations to complete a level. When you're near a surface ripe for defacing, a tiny ~graffiti balloon~ pops up over your head. Hit the L trigger, and you'll start painting - on-screen icons prompt you to make sweeping motions with the analog pad, which creates lovely streetwise artwork. You'll need to keep an eye on your spray can stock, since you're limited to the number of cans you can carry at once (don't worry, they've been liberally scattered around each city block).  So, you skate, you spray, and you run like hell when the cops show up. After you paint a number of targets, the police barge in, waving their billy clubs menacingly. You'd best take to the air before they tackle you - or Chief Onishima plugs you with his revolver (a flashing arrow keeps you alerted to his location at all times). After the first few levels, the cops realize that foot-based troops can't stop a punk kid on a pair of nitrium battery-powered rollerblades - and they break out surplus World War II weaponry. I won't give it away, but some of the heavy-metal armament the cops use against you will send you into fits of terror. The Apache attack helicopters are just the beginning... just wait until the stormtroopers show up.  As you progress through the game, you'll find that rivals will pop up at the GG's garage, challenging you to a certain trick or race. If you can pull it off, they'll join the gang, and their character is unlocked. There are at least ten different bad-asses to play as, ranging from a boombox-toting rapper named Combo to a hottie Asian Goth named Cube. All of them have different stats in terms of power, technique, and graffiti, so you can go for multiple approaches in each level.  Not enough for you? You can unlock new graffiti designs by collecting the spinning icons hidden on each level, or make your own with a full-featured graffiti construction kit. And don't neglect the Internet mode, which lets you download a JPEG and turn it into in-game graffiti.  And then we have the graphics. Oh. My. God. The most striking feature of Jet Set Radio are the ~cel-shaded~ characters, which employ a rendering trick that makes them appear to be hand-drawn (while maintaining the feel of 3D). Not only that, but the characters cast realistic shadows on both themselves and the environment - check out some of the sunset levels to see what I mean. Each protagonist moves with amazing motion-captured fluidity, and I have never gotten tired of watching their over-the-top victory dances.  The levels also do an awesome job at contributing to the game's CG-anime look. The levels in this game are relatively large - maybe the size of a few Crazy Taxi blocks - but the raw amount of detail is friggin' mind-blowing. We're talking about super-sharp custom textures on every building, innocent bystanders walking the streets, massive vehicles attempting to blow the crap out of you, and crazy polygon counts. The game uses some heavy-duty level-of-detail technology that reduces the number of polygons in the distance, while eliminating environment pop-up. Run it through a VGA box, and you'll never look at games the same way again.  The whole package is brought together by one of the most masterfully integrated soundtracks since NiGHTS. Professor K cranks out hip-hop beats, bubblegum pop, techno, and rap - and the game automatically transitions between songs like an expert DJ cutting a non-stop megamix. It's rumored that Sega will be chopping up the musical content and splicing in more ~American~ bands - if this is the case, it'll be one of the worst musical casualties since the bastardization of Sonic on the Sega CD.  So yeah -- Jet Set Radio is pretty damn tight. But just like Brittany Spears has that tiny pimple on her left butt-cheek (or so I hear), there are one or two flaws that keep the game from reaching godlike perfection. The camera system works pretty well most of the time, but occasionally gets confused when you're maneuvering through tight spaces. You also have to center the camera at times when you're lining up a jump, since it doesn't auto-track perfectly in some situations. But the biggest sin is that the camera-centering button is the same as the ~paint~ button! There are multiple instances where this becomes an enormous pain in the ass. The game only uses three buttons - why couldn't they have mapped the default camera button to the Y key?  The other flaw is that Jet Set is a bit short. I was able to complete the game after around three days of hard-core playing - then again, I don't remember eating, going to the bathroom, or sleeping during that time period, so your personal mileage may vary. There are three stages in each of the three cities, and after you complete them, it unlocks a new set of levels. These are basically the same three city levels mashed together, and interconnected through tunnels and hidden passageways. While this is pretty damn incredible from a technical standpoint (there's no visible loading time), I would have appreciated some new areas to tag. Ah well - at least the American version should include an extra city to explore.  From title screen to final boss, Jet Set Radio is non-stop entertainment. It's like NiGHTS -- the more skilled you become, the bigger the adrenaline rush, and the more awesome the sense of freedom. Jet Set Radio embodies all that I adore about Sega: it's got incredible character design, gameplay that's been tweaked to perfection, and technology that makes other developers sit back and wonder how they're going to catch up. This game is the reason why you bought your Dreamcast - and if Jet Set is swallowed up in the smoke and mirrors of the PS2 launch in November, then gaming is truly dead. Import away, kids.  -- Colin ~Rudie~ Williamson, IGNDC       Lasting Appeal 7.2  Overall  9.5 Argh.  This is why I hate where video gaming is headed.  Why?  Because games like this are so few and far between! Thanks largely to formulaic RPGs, rehashed fighters and the ever-elusive Bubba factor, original, innovative titles are going the way of Meatloaf's acting career. Thankfully, Sega's not dead yet, folks, and if this game doesn't prove it to you, then you probably won't care when they are.  I agree with Colin on the camera, but outside that, this game is pure perfection.  Beautiful, stylistic visuals, one of the coolest soundtracks ever slapped on a GD-ROM and more attitude than me in the morning.  Let's hope they don't butcher this masterpiece during localization.The Verdict: Import", "date": "Jul 11, 2000"}
