The screenshots of large-breasted anime girls on the back of the box seemed to indicate that Space Griffon was some type of sci-fi dating simulator or naughty panty-shot adventure, as opposed to a member of the action-shooter genre.  But after cracking the shrinkwrap and giving this one a spin in the ol' Dreamcast, I can safely say, yes, Space Griffon is an action game  albeit one that looks and plays so terribly that it's no wonder they're trying to hide the gameplay screenshots.  The plot behind Space Griffon won't win any awards for creativity  a military-run lunar base named HAMLET goes on the fritz, losing all radio contact. The ~A-Max Cleaner~ rescue team is sent in with their armada of big honkin' transformable mechs, determined to discover the cause of the blackout.  Of course, it turns out that everything's gone plumb haywire, the robots have gone loopy, and zombies patrol the dark halls of the base. And since you're strapped into three tons of mecha and loaded up with special weapons, it's your job to kill them all. But you're not going in alone  accompanying you is a squad of bickering teammates (who never actually show up to help you out).  Okay, the plot's not exactly fantastic, but we'd be happy to ignore it if the game was nicely executed. Sadly, Space Griffon is an amateur effort that's about as enjoyable as breaking a dozen cement slabs with your forehead, and looks definitely to be one of the all-time low-points on our favorite console system. Space Griffon is presented from a first-person, inside-the-mech perspective. The analog pad is used for movement, while the digital pad lets you look up and down. Since your mech is transformable, there are two ways you can play  in biped mode, and tank mode. Playing as the traditional Big Robot makes the control slog along in an unresponsive fashion, and most gamers will opt to transform into the tank and zip around in that shape for most of the game.  Your weapon loadout consists of the stock beam weapons and lock-on missiles, and repair units and extra ammo have been courteously scattered all over the base in preparation for your arrival. Some weapons are only accessible in either of the modes, making it necessary to swap back and forth between robotic forms.  Similar to Sega's Burning Rangers, your teammates are always contacting you via radio to update with you important information. Unfortunately, the boys at Panther Software were unable to write code that spools voice off the CD while you actually play the game. This means that when your buddies contact you or you encounter a locked door, the action stops entirely, and you have to wait for the voice to stop playing before you can move again. Yes, this is even if you're in the middle of blasting an enemy. The only thing that moves on the screen is a tiny viewing window with a three-frame animation of the character's mouth moving. Even the characters are poorly rendered  I've seen better art off the Pokemon Hentai newsgroups, fer cryin' out loud. Also, you don't have to speak Japanese to realize how bad the voice acting is  and I'll swear I heard background noises during some of the lengthier passages of bad dialogue, which mostly consist of ~Oh no! This door is locked! We must find the keycard!~  Remember the cool, multi-layered stages of Burning Rangers, with all that funk-a-licious colored lighting and boss-looking architecture? You'll find nothing that distinctive in Space Griffon, which features levels that fall somewhere between Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. Each level is irritatingly mazelike with plenty of ninety-degree turns, with all the floors and ceilings at one set height. This means that just about every area in the game looks identical, and even Daniel Boone would get lost without the included automap (which, annoyingly, must be turned off before you go into combat mode).  Adding to the tedium is the fact that Space Griffon is little more than a key-hunting game, with giant chunks of boring-ass dialogue interleaved with the action to make it appear that something exciting is actually happening. No effort is made to create a suspension of disbelief  there's no in-game music, and the majority of the game is silent, without any ambient noises or clanking machinery in the background.  It gets worse. The HAMLET base is occupied by a thick layer of black fog that impairs your vision exponentially. My first words upon starting the game were ~Hey! I'm playin' Turok!~ Now, we know that the Windows CE programming environment isn't the most powerful library in the canon of Dreamcast developer tools,  but even Sega Rally 2 didn't start fogging things out past ten feet. On the plus side, the game does run at 60fps without a hint of slowdown, but then again, it almost looks as bad as Robotica on the Saturn. Nobody in their right mind will be licensing this particular graphics engine.  Similarly embarrassing are the enemy robots, which have been modeled to keep the polygon counts absurdly low. Most of them are barely animated, and some of them just ~slide~ along the floor on invisible wheels. I don't think I've seen so many crappy-looking robots in one place since Timmy Vasquez showed me his collection of Crayola Transformers drawings back in first grade.  But what about all the sexy anime girls on the back of the box? Yup, they're in there  during the game's cut-scenes, you get to sit back and marvel at beautifully rendered cartoon gals who've been animated with all the care of a South Park episode. Their mouths move, and that's usually it. If you want high-quality anime, go rent Macross 7.  Another strange little quirk of Space Griffon is its incompatibility with certain third-party controllers. The game refused to recognize either of the VMS units in my Mad Catz Dream Pad, nor would it utilize the Jump Pack. However, everything was kosher on my stock Sega controllers (both of which had the patented broken analog triggers).  I think I've gotten my point across. Space Griffon is a lousy first-person shooter, and a sorry excuse for a transforming-mech game. We'll hope that the infinitely superior Shogo: Mobile Armor Division makes its way to the Dreamcast, and will help erase any memories I have of this turd. Importers beware.  -- Colin ~I've given bad scores to every import DC game I've reviewed~ Williamson, IGN DC", "date": "Nov 14, 1999"}
