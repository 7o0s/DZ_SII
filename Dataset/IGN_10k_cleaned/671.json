They did it for the guitar with Guitar Freaks, drums with Beat Mania, and dancing with Dance Dance Revolution. Now, they've managed to take the single largest reason to get drunk on a boat, fishing, and by God, they've made it FUN.   Fisherman's Bait 2: Big Ol' Bass takes all the boring monotony that's usually associated with fishing and injected bait-hungry aquatic life into its place. Even without the quintessential fishing controller, you're guaranteed to have a blast- for a few minutes. That's right, while Fisherman's Bait 2 is a blast to play in short bursts, the long-term game falls a little short.   Gameplay Let me just say this now: if you're going to play a fishing game, ANY fishing game, you're going to need a fishing controller. There's just no comparing the experience of using a device that at least partially resembles the actual instrument that you'd normally use. That said, it's now up to the game to deliver the worm-gobbling goodness. And brother, does this game give it up.   Fisherman's Bait 2 was originally an arcade game, so anyone thinking they're going to get a fishing sim will be out of luck. You're cut loose in one of 5 lakes, using one of 10 different lures. Now since this IS an arcade fishing title, you've given 2 minutes. You're also given the world's most irresistible lure (no matter which one you pick), so as soon as the pseudo-fish or grub hits the water, you're going to get a bite.    Now with 2 minutes to catch a fish, you're not going to get an epic, Hemmingway-esque struggle. The fish will fight, but you'll have enough time to reel in a few more before the time's up. The bigger the fish you catch, the more time you get added onto your clock, nice and simple.  Add to this, a tournament mode with various objectives (catch 3 fish totaling 30 lbs or more, for instance), a ~World Monster Fishing~ option (with insanely-sized fish, some weighing over a thousand pounds, set in a post-apocalyptic near future), a livewell to see what you've caught, and you've got quite the fishing experience.   Graphics Pretty much every fishing game, no matter what type, offers the same thing in the way of graphic muscle, and Fisherman's Bait 2 is no different. A static 2D image is ~animated~ by way of a ripple effect on the water section of the image. A popup window appears once the lure is dropped, and it's all in 3D, and done quite well. Once you've hooked the fish, various cut scenes will show the fish trying (in vain- heh heh heh) to escape. While it's nice to see a completely 3D environment from time to time, there are short pauses that really interrupt the whole catching process. Overall however, the graphics are clean, and well done.    The textures are crisp, and the fish are fantastically animated. The only real problem with the fish themselves is the fact that you can't tell what kind is biting until the view switches to the full 3D, underwater shot, making actually finding that elusive big ol' bass unnecessarily tough.   Sound Have you EVER heard music in a fishing game that doesn't sound like someone standing in an elevator has dubbed it? (This is assuming you've played a lot of fishing games, of course.) I'll answer for you: nope. So, surprise, surprise, when it finally comes time to reel the fish in, you're gifted to Musac 101. Other than that, though, the sound effects are quite top-notch. You hear distinctive plops and chimes as needed, and there's that ever-lovable Konami smack-endowed announcer butting in with such handy phrases as ~Fish on!~ and ~Awwwww line break!~   If, you're looking for a fishing sim, you'll find yourself with a game unfit for any real extended periods of play. If, on the other hand,  you're not a die-hard angler, and you want some instant fishing gratification without the hassles of a day-long virtual cast-and-reel extravaganza, then pick up a copy of FB2, you won't be disappointed.", "date": "Feb 1, 2000"}
