Not one to let some decent code go to waste, EA has repurposed the mobile Mini Golf for iPod -- and the resulting game is actually superior than its source material. Mini Golf is one of the better games of the iPod game service launch.   Helping matters is the click wheel, which makes lining up shots simple. Running your finger around the wheel spins your little duffer and as soon as you have the desired angle, clicking the center button starts the power charge meter. Click it again to select the amount of juice you want behind the putt and let' er go. These east-breezy, sensible controls -- coupled with some great course design -- make Mini Golf a charmer.   Mini Golf sports three 18-hole courses, each with a playful theme: Tiki, Egyptian, and circus. The holes are full of obstacles and hazards, such as water, windmills, animals, and graded surfaces. All the features you would find on a real mini golf course, such as alternate routes to the cup for dropping the ball in a seemingly difficult hole, are utilized in clever ways. The difficulty curve is smart, too -- no matter which course you start on (and you have to unlock the two beyond Tiki by scoring low), you have a couple holes that let you get your bearings.   The game looks great. Mini Golf's courses are bright, colorful, and full of excellent detail. The backdrops sport slight animations -- bubbling lava in the Tiki course and alligators in Egypt, for example. The effect of the overheard camera snaking around the course between holes is also very cool. Mini Golf features three musical pieces -- one for each course.  Mini Golf is one of my favorite games of the initial nine for iPod. The smart controls make it simple to line up accurate shots. The courses are designed exceptionally well and the art direction is great. True, the game offers just basic mini golf action, but not every wheel needs to be re-invented. Unless golf holds no interest for you, consider making Mini Golf one of the first games you download for your iPod.", "date": "Sep 15, 2006"}
