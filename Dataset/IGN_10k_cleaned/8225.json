The board game that was a certifiable American phenom in the 1980s returns to mobile with some much-needed extra features and an online mode that will tickle those with like-minded friends and a spare 90 minutes to smack talk over the minutia of Babe Ruth's baseball career.   Trivial Pursuit is one of those easy download decisions. You either want this or you don't. There are few people that idle in the middle ground about Trivial Pursuit. Either they love it or loathe it. Since I am in the former category, I found myself readily entertained by this accurate replica of the board game. Collecting pie wedges and answering questions on mobile is actually even easier since the game utilizes multiple choice questions. Instead of being rendered cerebrally flaccid by a sports question, for example, I actually now had a one-in-four chance of getting another roll of the dice.   The mobile game offers a few extra rule sets to change up the play structure. You can have the Daily Trivial Pursuit challenge or the speedier Wedge Challenge play. Category Challenge narrows down the field, eliminating categories in which you might not be well versed.   Starwave and developer UIEvolution juiced the game with a very robust and usable online mode. You can challenge friends to trivia contests via buddy lists. During matches, a real-time chat feature let's you harangue and harass each other. During a test game, we used the chat feature to remind each other not to use Wikipedia or Google to earn wedges. The new Coliseum mode is a very solid addition to the package: You can enter a game room and engage up to nine other players in speed rounds. The first player to answer the question from the provided quartet of answers is ~teh winnar.~  If you already have Trivial Pursuit on your mobile, the only choice is whether or not you need to upgrade. If you want fresh questions, need modes, and a great online experience, then the answer is an easy yes. This is the best version of Trivial Pursuit available on mobile, complete with a database of 10,000 questions, an accessible interface, and the vaunted online play. You'll feel smart downloading it... only to have the game make you feel dumb a couple minutes later with an ultra-tough question. But that's what the pursuit of trivia is all about.", "date": "Mar 20, 2007"}
