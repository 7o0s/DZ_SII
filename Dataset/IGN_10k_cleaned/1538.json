With what programmers can do with today's consoles, you would think no one would ever encounter a problem in creating new games.  But when you're Namco, one of the few videogame pioneers who has seen and done it all, it might be harder to find something you haven't done before.  So, let's not kid ourselves here... Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness isn't exactly what we call innovative, deep, or complex.  It basically takes the classic 2D-gameplay mechanics of Ms. Pac-Man, dresses it up in 3D visuals, and places a few puzzles here and there.  Yeah, it doesn't sound very appealing until you play it.  While it's simple and the visuals are a bit dated, Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness has enough enjoyable moments and a good number of extras to make it stand out among the many other ~classic~ recreations that have been hitting consoles as of late.  When you start up the game you have four choices of gameplay: Quest, Mulitplayer, Time Trial, and Classic.  Quest is the main story mode where Ms. Pac-Man must retrieve the four Gems of Virtue in order to restore the delicate balance of Pac-Land.  The four Gems of Virtue are found in the four corners of Pac-Land, each area with its own distinct theme.  Each area is made of up several rooms, most of which require you to eat a certain number of pellets in order to continue on.  To complicate matters, many rooms also have puzzles; just because you ate the last pellet doesn't mean you move on to the next area.  Of course, the puzzle elements usually revolve around block pushing and switch-flipping.  For the most part, the puzzles aren't that difficult though a few do require a couple of minutes of thinking and experimentation.  Time Trial basically puts you though the same levels but instead of chomping down on some power pellets, you'll be grabbing stopwatches in order to have enough time to complete a level.  Of the four modes, the Multiplayer gave me the most pleasant surprise.  Three different multiplayer game modes are available: Dot Mania, Ghost Tag, and Da Bomb.  Out of all of them, Dot Mania seemed to be the most enjoyable as players need to grab 80 total pellets to win.  This ain't easy when you have to avoid ghosts and pick up power-up attacks in order to get the advantage of your enemy.  Sure, it's nowhere near the level of Bomberman, but it certainly is a lot of crazy fun when you get four players vying for precious pellets, while picking up assorted power-ups like lightning, firewall, and turbo boost.  And of course, the classic old-skool Ms. Pac-Man is in here, emulated straight from the arcade version.  So, it might have basic gameplay that only a five-year old would find amusing, but Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness certainly has a good amount of extra options to keep even the most hardened gamer busy.  Even with the 3D visuals, the quality of the visuals is barely acceptable for Dreamcast standards.  Of course, this game was designed to go cross platform, so I can understand how Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness might look like a high-res PlayStation game on the Dreamcast.  However, I don't like it; while the game is certainly more colorful and sharper looking, as well as having a slightly higher framerate than it's PlayStation cousin, it would have been nice if Namco would have given this game the ~royal Soul Calibur treatment.  Yeah, I know I ask a lot, but I know the game should've looked better on a Dreamcast.  In addition, the game has a few camera problems that do affect gameplay.  These camera problems are most immediately seen when shifting to a new area of a level where you can lose track of where Ms. Pac-Man is.    Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness certainly scores points when it comes to the music.  Sound effects are the decent Pac-Man stock, but the music is very catchy.  Delightful techno tunes combined with an '80s sound certainly appeals to me, and while it can be too cutesy at times, the happy tunes will contribute to your enjoyment of this simple game.  Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness may lack the bells and whistles when it comes to the visuals for a Dreamcast game, but a good number of options and the addictive nature of gobbling pellets is hard to beat.  --Anthony ~Uses Pac-Man Pattern C~ Chau, IGNDC Ms. Pac-Man was always the better Pac-Man because of its multiple mazes, and I would get this game over Pac-Man: Special Color Edition (if I had to choose between the two, of course). The real clincher to get this game is Super Pac-Man, it's a much better extra than Pac-Attack is for Pac-Man: Special Color Edition. I just wish the link-cable option that was in Pac-Man was in Ms. Pac-Man  this omission is the only real downside to this great, absolute must-have Game Boy game.", "date": "Nov 28, 2000"}
