Do you review it in its own right, treating as an original product? Or do you take into account the previous incarnations, judging if the title is a true advancement of the franchise and worthy of shelling out another $40 for?  Ah, the perils of a games reviewer....   Soccer is a game that is played by most of the known world, yet still manages to confuse us here in the land of Madden, Shaq and Barry Bonds. 22 guys running round a field with only one break (after 45 minutes) no timeouts, no continuous breaks for commercials and the whole thing lasts only 90 minutes.  As you would expect form the EA Sports folks, FIFA 2002 has options coming out the wazoo, 15 different domestic leagues from around the world including England, Italy and Israel. All the international teams are here as well, so if you ever fancied finding out who would win in a match up between Bahrain and Paraguay, now's your chance. FIFA also has a large number of 'real world' players to chose from, most of them being accurate representations of their human counterparts.   The game has three skill settings, and each one represents a pretty stiff learning curve compared to the last FIFA. Shooting is now more difficult as they have improved the Keeper AI and tweaked the shooting dynamic so you have to position the ball exactly where you mean it to go. Sounds sensible I hear you say? It is, but for two major drawbacks.  EA have removed the 'training' option so you cannot practice your skills, and the only decent camera angle in the game is side on, so you cannot aim accurately because you can't see all of the net. Also, it is incredibly difficult to score from outside the box, something that the computer opponents do with ease.   Unfortunately, the game has a few major bugs, the same bugs in fact as I experienced in FIFA 2000 a few years ago.   1. The defensive players on your team are stupid -- period. They fall for the same long ball tactic every time and are really slow when it comes to reading and intercepting opponents' passes. Of course you would think that the player would be able to compensate for his team's shortcomings, and I would agree, except that it takes an age to switch from player to player, and by the time you're in control of the guy who matters, your opponent has scored. This affects every defensive player no matter if they are the best or worst in the world and soon gets very annoying.  2. If you try and tinker with your team's formations, the computer goes crazy and starts putting players out of position on the pitch- which has a severely detrimental effect on your chances of winning. Example: Wales vs. Norway -- Playing as Wales I wanted my wide midfield men to push down the flanks and my second striker to play just behind the first. I set this up and got into the game to find that my two strikers are on the wings, while my two left-sided midfielders are now up front, and that's impossible to change without abandoning the formation totally -- the same bug as in FIFA 2000.  3. Some of the players are just plain inaccurate in their ratings or positions. If you chose the England team, there is a player in there called Joe Cole -- now any England supporter will tell you Joe Cole is an exciting attacking midfield layer for West Ham and England. Ask them if young Mr. Cole can play in central defense (as this game has him doing) and they will collapse with laughter. I know this is not a bug as such -- but it is the same fault as appears in FIFA 2000 and is down to poor fact checking. It may spoil the realism of the game for absolute purists.  The game does have good points. The players now make runs into space so you can utilize their pace to get behind defenders by passing the ball over or behind defenses -- which can make for some spectacular goals. This is a vast improvement over the 'magic boots' syndrome of previous versions where even the most audacious pass from the most untalented hoofer would magically find its way to its target and stick like glue. Now if you make a bad pass (and you will) you loose possession, as you should.  As I mentioned, variety is the spice and FIFA 2002 has lots, tailoring almost every aspect of the game to your needs (when the computer lets you, that is). There are rewards to be gained for completing the preset tournaments in the form of additional bonus unlocked tournaments (So far I have unlocked the European Soccer Championships by gaining World Cup qualification with a European team.)   Is the game pretty? Yes. Nice movie graphics on my GeForce 3 card, but in-game looks similar to FIFA 2000. It does the job though. All the nice little flicks and back heels are there to add some eye candy. Sound is good -- nice in-game tunes, and great English commentary from two legends of the English Soccer Media -- John 'Motty' Motson and Andy 'Housewives choice' Gray. These guys are the Maddens of the Soccer game and can often be found on Fox Sports Worlds EPL coverage.  Multiplayer allows for two players on the same PC -- good fun -- I'd recommend it to anyone. But as to online play, I have issues with  EA's multiplayer policy. If you consult the manual for multiplayer info, you find this.... 'Online Gameplay for FIFA Soccer 2002 will only be available thru October 30th 2002.' Does this mean that when my game gets 11 months old I wont be able to play online anymore? Naughty EA -- way to make a product obsolete and force me to spend another $40!  On its own it's a good, if flawed soccer game that is probably the best out there. Not much of an improvement from the last few incarnations. If you have 2000 or 2001 and don't care about the updated players etc  - don't bother. If you don't have a soccer game -- this is easily worth a look, as are practically all of EA''s sports outings.  -- Mark Jones      Want to share your opinions with the world?
