As soon as this baby starts up you're going to be wowed by the incredibly detailed stadiums and the impressive player animations. And it keeps getting better!   On the action side, the gameplay is solidly done. Passing is very easy to do and you can modify receivers' routes from the scrimmage line. To my dismay, penalties are also very authentic, as I got caught misbehaving far too often. There are a number of other nice touches in the game that make the playing field fun. Defenders can pump up the home crowd when things start getting dicey and the instant replay is like watching TV.   When you're not on the field, you also get to manage your team. Running your franchise is a pretty straight forward stats oriented affair but done up in a very high concept interface.    For an extra thrill, you can play the ~Madden Challenge.~ Admittedly, this mode is sort of a kitchen sink extra, but it is sort of fun at the same time. The goal is to rack up 2000 Madden Points by achieving as many sacks, long passes or touchdowns as possible in a given game. Get to 2000 and you'll unlock secret teams.   The one part of the game I didn't like is what the whole game franchise is based on, Madden. His commentary is so inane I could barely stand it. Co-announcer pat summerall is no better, delivering the play by play in the most monotonous dead pan you can imagine.    Commentary gripes aside, I dig this game. It is the first major sports title on the Mac in way too long and in terms of pure gameplay, it is a big winner.", "date": "Jun 10, 2002"}
