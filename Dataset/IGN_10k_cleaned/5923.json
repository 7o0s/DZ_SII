Tri-Peaks Solitaire, a take on the classic single-player card game, is perhaps my favorite of the three, as it is the most instantly enjoyable -- which has a lot to do with its complete familiarity. This is a game that has been released in a few packages, including Yahoo! Pyramids for mobile, but Pogo.com's presentation has it all over that previous release.   For the virginal among us, Tri-Peaks Solitaire is played by matching cards from a three-peaked pyramid of face-down cards with a starting row of ten face-up cards. Cards are pulled from the peaks by creating ascending or descending strings of cards, regardless of the suit. Every game has a solution -- if you fail to clear the screen by hitting a dead end of sorts with non-sequential cards, the game is over.   In Tri-Peaks Solitaire, that means the little archeologist at the top of the screen is dropped into a pit or swallowed whole by a man-eating plant. There are three treasure chests along the top of the screen, and with each successful game, the mobile Indy Jones gets closer to his bounty. Unlocking chests wins bonuses, such as wild card power-ups or bonus tokens.   Now, about those tokens -- this is easily the coolest part of playing the Pogo.com games, save for the fact that they are just straight up enjoyable experiences. Playing the branded games accumulates tokens, which can be used to enter prize drawing on Pogo.com. Because these Pogo wireless games can ~link~ up to an existing Pogo account, you can really pool your resources for better chances at prize money, such as $50 daily jackpots all the way up to $1,000 monthly paydays.  Tri-Peaks Solitaire is an excellent casual game for mobile players looking to burn a little free time here and there, but are nowhere near their PC and Pogo.com accounts. The lure of prize money is always hard to resist, but at least in the case of Tri-Peaks Solitaire, the chase is definitely half the fun. This is an easy pick-up game that many will find hard to stop playing, myself included.", "date": "Aug 12, 2005"}
