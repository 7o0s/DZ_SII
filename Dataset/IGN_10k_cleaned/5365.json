It seems some crazy old guy decided it would be a good idea to get his hands on some DNA from these ancient creatures (I think they're called dinosaurs) and whip-up a quick batch of 30-foot tall reptiles, set them on an island, and have these little fleshy creatures (I think they're called humans) pay a couple of bucks to go see 'em.  Everything was going great until the dinosaurs got hungry and decided the fleshy creatures would be the perfect snack . . . no hard shells to bite through, they're real slow, and those tiny weak bones just melt in your mouth, num-nummers.  Trespasser, based on The Lost World: Jurassic Park, takes place on Site B, a dinosaur breeding island.  You assume the role of the buff and tuff Anne, who just happens to be vacationing in Costa Rica and decides to take a tour of the surrounding islands.  Now, I can't stress this enough folks: DO NOT CHARTER A FLIGHT TO GO LOOK AT THE LITTLE ISLANDS AROUND COSTA RICA!!!  We all know what happens.  Some freak accident sends your plane spiraling out of control, you crash into the Pacific, everyone dies but you, and you end up where?  That's right: Site B.  Let me tell you, when I started playing Trespasser I thought it stank.  I was ready to chuck it out the window -- give it the old heave-ho.  Even on a P300MHz, the framerate was incredibly slow, the gameworld was difficult to navigate, and the controls were unlike any other first-person shooter I had ever played.  But, after giving Trespasser a couple of hours and becoming familiar with the interface, I got hooked on the game.  OK, the framerate still sucked, but it was something I could overlook because I had gotten into the story of the game.  It was super-intriguing and the dinosaurs actually looked and moved really well.  The realistic physics engine is amazing and objects move like they would in real-life.  However, the realistic engine doesn't come without complications.  It's difficult to make long jumps, things get knocked out of Anne's hand when she's traversing rough terrain, and she can get stuck in areas if you go to far down a cliff and realize you can't climb back up.  Yet the physics engine is a paradox in itself, making the game so wonderfully genuine but ultimately causing Trespasser to be frustrating and unplayable on the majority of machines owned by PC gamers.  And even though the physics engine allows game objects to move like real-world objects, Anne can't interact with the surrounding environment.  She can't climb trees, boulders, or even some low-slope hills that would be easy to scale in reality.  Another frustrating aspect of the Trespasser engine is that you lose your weapons when you progress to another level.  With such an emphasis on realism you would think that the designers would let you keep your hard earned guns after simply walking through the door or jumping over the wall that leads to the next area.  Graphically, the environments in Trespasser are blocky and heavily pixelated, but the dinosaurs themselves look pretty good and move like real animals would.  If you pop a Velociraptor in the head but don't kill it, blood will spurt out of its cranium and it will trip, fall, and run away.  The Brachiosaurs, huge herbivores with long necks and small heads, are massive in comparison and I applaud the art team for designing such convincing dinos.  Instead of providing the standard health meter in the corner, the art designers decided a heart tattoo that fills with red as you get hurt would be the best way of preserving game sensibility without giving you the feel of looking through a HUD.  Of course, it just happens to be on her left breast.  That's right, er ... left, you have to look down at your cleavage to check your health.  And I must add that Anne has quite a package -- I'm saying even UPS wouldn't deliver this one.  Real cute, guys.  And I know there were even some women on the graphical design team.  I'd like to hear what they said about this.  There are several graphical bugs which will hopefully be fixed with upcoming patches.  Your guns periodically disappear, which is especially frightful when you're fighting a couple of Raptors and you don't know if you've dropped you're gun or it's simply not being displayed.  But the most annoying graphical problem is the arm effect.  As you look through Anne's eyes, your right hand constantly flops around in front of you . . . and I do mean flops.  Now this might not be a bug, but it sure is stupid.  When you're holding a pistol it's almost as if Anne has just downed a bottle of Tequila, went down to the Guns 'n' Such, and picked herself up a Princess Special because she waves the damn thing around wildly.  I also wondered where her left arm was while playing Trespasser.  Even when you grab the shotgun or rifle you don't stabilize the barrel with your left hand, instead holding it with only the right in the same drunken fashion.  Maybe Anne's left arm got lopped off in the plane crash.  The arm also offers up some wild slapstick humor.  Occasionally it gets caught in the game environment, between a door and a wall for example, and it gets stuck.  But this doesn't hamper Anne, oh no.  In classic Mr. Fantastic style, the arm stretches as you leave the area to explore further.  Look back and you can see your arm stretched out for miles over the terrain.  Hit the mouse button and it comes snapping back like a rubberband.  Now that's funny . . . somebody should use the Trespasser engine to make a game based in the Marvel universe.  On a positive note, the sound system in Trespasser is one of the best I've encountered in any game.  Along with the realistic physics engine, the designers developed a realistic sound engine which really compliments the action.  If you walk into a pond not only do you hear your feet sloshing through the water, but you also hear the ripples lapping on the shore.  If you throw a basketball against a brick wall (yes, there are basketballs in the game) it sounds like a basketball rebounding off a brick wall, and it sounds completely different if you bounce it off a wooden shed.   The first-person shooter market is stuffed with too many clones and non-innovators.  With Trespasser, the designers have attempted to truly revolutionize the genre.  It's one of those rare games that tries to break away from the run, strafe, shoot system all to familiar in action games today.  The designers should be praised for their efforts, but shot for their implementation.  The problem is that Trespasser suffers from the same thing that plagued Strike Commander years ago: it's a game that is too far ahead of its time.  The hardware available now just can't handle it.  I can tell what the designers were trying to do, but they didn't quite make it.  I don't hesitate to recommend this game . . . if you have the system to run it.  And it takes quite a friggin' system.  I played it on a P300MHz and I don't think I would recommend trying it on the same -- it's frustrating at best.  Even on a P450MHz, the movement was a bit choppy but tolerable.  If you can stand the clunky movement in Trespasser, you're in for a real treat.  This is a ground-breaking game.  I bet after DreamWorks releases a few patches and computer technology catches up to it, Trespasser will have renewed life, just like the dinosaurs it focuses on.  -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Oct 31, 1998"}
