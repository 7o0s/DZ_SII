Treasure's Radiant Silvergun is the best example of innovation in an overdone genre ? released in 1998, this Saturn-based shooter featured RPG-like elements, special attack combinations, and a ton of slick features to enhance the replay value.  Unfortunately, Giga Wing does not follow in the footsteps of Silvergun --in fact, it takes several steps backwards. Giga Wing is a straight port of an arcade shooter that ran on Capcom's lethargic CPS2 hardware, and suffered limited American distribution. And why Capcom ever decided to drop this retro-gaming compost heap onto a 128-bit super-console is beyond my comprehension ? this type of game would have been much better suited on the Playstation (or Super Nintendo, for that matter).  But enough bickering, let's get down to the facts: Giga Wing is a top-down scrolling shooter, similar to such classics as 1943 and Raiden. Before the game starts, you can choose your character, which determines the fighting abilities of your ship. Sinnosuke fires a powerful phalanx beam that takes out enemies to the sides, Ruby is limited to a straight ? but powerful ? line of fire, Isha has homing missiles mounted to her ship, and Stuck (that's not a typo) is a general all-rounder.  After choosing your pilot, you're treated to a little bit of voice acting to set up the storyline. From there, you're dumped into the game, which consists of the same blister-inducing fare as a thousand similar 16-bit games. You know the drill ? hold down the fire button to let out a never-ending spray of molten death, pick up tidbits of armor that are left behind, and snag various weapon power-ups. At the end of each stage, you get to duke it out with an enormous boss character, who is, naturally, content on repeating an attack pattern and leaving his one weak point open.  At least there's one unique gameplay feature added into the mix ? if you hold down the fire button, you can deflect shots back at your enemies, and enjoy a few seconds of invincibility. You can do this as frequently as the meter at the bottom of the screen recharges, and it's the only way to keep your sanity when the screen is overburdened with enemy projectiles. You're also loaded up with Force Bombs, which cause screen-filling amounts of raw destruction, and destroy any enemy bullets headed your way. Giga Wing is obnoxiously hard from the get-go, just like hard-core shooter fans like it. There are times when an enemy will send out a spray of bullets that covers the entire screen, and dodging the shots is a near-impossible affair.  But it doesn't really matter, since you get unlimited continues! I was able to blast my way through the entire game in a whopping twenty-four minutes, which makes this game almost as short as Dynamite Cop. Replay value? Yeah, right. Aside from the never-ending quest for the high score, there's not much here: playing as a different character just swaps the order of the stages, the ~Tutorial Mode~ is a non-interactive snooze, and the ~Gallery~ is lame, lame, lame. Longevity is not this game's strong suit.  Giga Wing attempts nothing daring in terms of gameplay, nor does it make a mild attempt to look good. I know that the CPS2 isn't the most powerful hardware on the planet, but on the Dreamcast, this game looks embarrassing. The graphics are in low resolution, the art design is stale, and the only thing that makes the game remotely interesting to look at is the obscene amount of sprites flying around the screen (watch out for slowdown). It also looks horrid when going through the VGA Box ? if you must play this game, make sure it's on a TV of some sort.  At the end of the experience, I didn't feel the urge to go back and play Giga Wing again ? instead, I felt like ejecting the disc, re-shrink wrapping the box, and taking it back to the store to get my sixty bucks back. Don't get me wrong ? I enjoy a decent 2D shooter as much as the next guy, but Giga Wing does nothing to push the envelope, and pales in comparison to the aging (but godly) Radiant Silvergun. If you're truly fanatical about your 2D shooters, you'll eat this game up ? but the rest of us should hold out for something a little less retro. Capcom, what were you thinking?  -- Colin ~R-Type Lord~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Nov 16, 1999"}
