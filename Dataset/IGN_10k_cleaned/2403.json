On the one hand, I'm a sucker for anything original, something brand new -- Rez, for example, or Dance Dance Revolution.  Even if there are questions as far as execution or longevity, I'll generally give extra points for originality.  At the same time, though, I have a strong nostalgic streak.  A good revival of a classic concept is liable to make me get all misty-eyed and weird, even if it's got comparatively gaping flaws.  Exhibits A, B, and C here are Legend of Mana, if you're interested in going back and reading a rookie effort.  Wizardry: Tales of the Forsaken Land falls squarely in the latter category.  It is not at all probable that any of you under, say, 25 years of age has even seen a game like this, and anybody older than that had to be a devotee of the Apple II, Commodore 64, or early IBM PC to play its earliest forebears in the United States.  The old Wizadry games were simple, frequently dull, and often mind-bogglingly difficult, but they also shaped the genre in ways that we still feel the effects of today -- Yuji Horii considers Wizardry a primary influence on the genesis of the Dragon Quest series.  Wizardry faded into relative obscurity for some time in the states, although it's undergoing a brief renaissance at present, but it maintained a fairly consistent loyalty in Japan at that same time, and the series' basic concepts have passed into the hands of Japanese developers.  The result, in the case of Tales of the Forsaken Land, blends some surprisingly old RPG concepts with some surprisingly new ones, and 3D graphics in top of that.  It's a peculiar hybrid of a game, and one which will certainly not appeal to the RPG mainstream, but its blend of classic dungeon-crawling and more modern character interaction and development definitely has its attractions.  Gameplay  At its core, Wizardry is a dungeon crawl of the very old school.  You've come to a town that just happens to have the entrance to a massive underground labyrinth nearby, and now that they've closed down the local bowling alley, there's nothing left to do on the weekends except descend to its depths, slaughter a few monsters, and snag assorted bits of lost treasure on your way out.  Those of you who played these sorts of games when they were presented with four-color graphics on Texas Instruments cartridge computers should be overcome with a wave of disturbing nostalgia -- the gradually-revealed map, the tile-based dungeons (nothing but right angles here), and the local economy bent towards the singular purpose of supplying adventurers.  There are even curses on the items.  How long has it been since you found an item in an RPG and feared to equip it, lest you have to blow an unbelievable amount of money at the local temple?  Ahem.  We're getting ahead of ourselves here, yes?  It is true, though, that much of Wizardry's gameplay belongs to a bygone age.  The battles are rendered in realtime 3D, like the rest of the game, but you never see your party, exactly -- the perspective is first-person, just like Dragon Quest and Phantasy Star (since the original Wizardry games were the pattern for those series).  Progression is strictly turn-based, and outcomes are rigidly predictable...at least in the early going.  Wizardry has evolved with the times somewhat, and while the hard numbers of your weapons and defensive capabilities are primary determinants of victory or defeat, a little strategizing with your fellow party members can be the wild card that wins the battle.  The key advanced strategies in Wizardry revolve around Allied Actions, special attack and defense techniques performed by multiple members of the party.  Depending on their class, equipment types, and training, certain characters can work together to learn and perform Allied Actions, which gives them a substantial advantage in a fight.  In a neat twist, the more characters fight together and favorably interact, their level of trust increases, which makes teamwork even more effective.  That's the overarching theme of Wizardry's gameplay, a base of older design elements freshened just enough to be interesting.  Equipment acquisition and management is built around very familiar themes -- find it in chests or buy it at exorbitant prices from the shop -- but there's a touch of more modern collection and cannibalization elements when it comes to acquiring spells, which are synthesized from the leavings of many different monster types.  You build your party by picking up favorable candidates from a grab bag of classes at the local bar, but developing recruits into a functioning team involves fairly deep character interaction elements.  The quest and party development systems alike are affected by surprisingly detailed storylines -- what were faceless henchmen back in the old days are now characters with a story to tell.  Of course, this still isn't the kind of globe-trotting romp that Final Fantasy fans have come to enjoy.  There's still plenty of wandering through dungeons, gathering widgets, and disarming traps to fill your time (although the trap system has been spiced with a neat bit of twitchy button-tapping), and combat is still the primary activity above all.  Atlus has been kind enough to subtract the random encounters, though (it's actually not too hard to sidestep many enemies), and battles move surprisingly fast for their anachronistic style.  Twenty orcs standing in ranks is still a bit of a challenge, but if we could handle that in the Reagan administration, why not now?  Graphics  Wizardry's looks benefit a fair bit from having to present relatively simple subject matter.  Fog-bound towns and shadowy dungeons aren't the most difficult creations to render in 3D, after all.  The weather effects and lighting that overlay the stone walls and medieval architecture add an extra layer of atmosphere, though, occasionally creating a very effective impression of the chilly, dank environment down in the Labyrinth.  Snow falls on higher levels, torches flicker down below, and fog drifts about everywhere.  There's a lot of variation in terms of the modeling detail in the dungeons, and of course, many rooms are thoroughly bare, but others have more complex constructions filling their space, from wizards' studies to huge staircases leading up and down the labyrinth's levels.  In combat, the details are stripped out for the most part, in favor of a very straightforward presentation.  The bad guys are modeled in a manner that gives a good impression of their volume, and they're frequently textured quite well, but their animation isn't always the best, and some, especially humanoid enemies, look more than a little weedy when they should be menacing instead.  Attacks are a mixed bag in the animation and effects department, with ordinary strikes often making you wish they weren't quite so long.  Others look a fair bit better, though, and there are a few that manage to be impressive without a lot of technical jiggery-pokery.  That aforementioned platoon of orcs can do a very nifty ~rush~ attack, all of them coming straight at your party at once.  Those aspects of the game that aren't rendered in 3D are perhaps the best-looking all around.  Wizardry includes a great deal of hand-drawn art to represent characters and settings (shop interiors and the like), and it's all done very well in a gritty, realistic fantasy style.  Maybe the priestesses ought to have more clothes on, but we can forgive some concessions to the interests of the audience.  The 2D art shows, at any rate, that some strong concept work went into designing the worlds that eventually became three-dimensional.  Sound  Wizardry's music, unlike most of its other aspects, doesn't give away its ties to any particular time.  It's a very low-key, ambient dungeon-crawl soundtrack, with slightly more active tunes to accompany combat sequences and a fairly predictable effects suite.  It does its part as far as setting the scene when you're wandering through those darkened corridors or battling hordes of the undead, but there's not much here in the way of genuinely inspiring tunes.  The effects are the same way, presenting the appropriate crunches, thwacks, and [insert onamatopoetic magical noise here], in workmanlike fashion. But that was never a strong point in your old-school RPGs.  Back then, we heard bleeps and bloops from our PC speakers and liked 'em.Wizardry is not for the present generation of RPG fan, except perhaps for the die-hard Final Fantasy Tactics sub-cult.  Now that I think about it, they might quite enjoy the mechanics of party management and emphasis on character interaction as a means to more advanced development.  If you like speed and flash in your RPGs, though, pass this one by, since it likely hasn't enough of either to suit your atrophied attention span.If you'd like a meaty dungeon-crawl experience, though, this is a surprisingly good one, and a pleasant nostalgia trip for those of us who haven't played a game like this in a dog's age.  Wizardry: Tales of the Forsaken Land certainly caters to a niche, but it does so very well.", "date": "Dec 21, 2001"}
