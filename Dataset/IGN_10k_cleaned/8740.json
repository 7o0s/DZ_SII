An effective mix of Asteroids and Geometry Wars, it takes the familiar ~Robotron spaceship~ concept and turns it into something distinctive. That's not an easy feat in a genre where the ongoing theme is simply ~obliterate everything,~ and yet, Super Stardust HD actually does it.   As is the case with most games of this type, there isn't a fancy story or overly complicated control scheme. Stardust is just about using both analog sticks to shoot your way through thousands of interstellar rocks and aliens and that's about it. But unlike other titles in this category, Stardust HD has a surprising amount of depth to its demolition. In addition to the default ~Rock Crusher~ laser, players also have access to the ~Gold Melter~ flamethrower and ~Ice Splitter~ shard gun. They can be swapped between at any time too; just flick the L1 or R1 triggers to do so or tap the L2 and R2 buttons to access the thrust feature or mega bomb.   If you think this is mayhem, you haven't seen anything yet. Having different weapons with distinct advantages over certain enemy types makes for a surprising amount of tactical decision-making in what would otherwise be a simple twitch shooter. Another cool element is the fact that the 25 different stages (made up of five planets with five phases each) can be traversed in a full 720 degrees. This move away from a static screen is one of the key ways in which Stardust separates itself from similar games. More importantly, it keeps things fresh and it keeps things fun.   And fun is really the best way to describe what Super Stardust HD is -- not only because there are literately thousands of objects to destroy onscreen at once, but because developer Housemarque has designed something that truly rewards skill. You're going to have to practice and practice and practice should you want to beat all five planets without dying. Extra lives are sparse, your weapon trio can be continually upgraded via power-ups, and the challenge ramps up fast and hard. Throw in incredibly satisfying explosions, surprisingly varied targets, and entertaining boss battles and voila! You're left with the most addictive experience on the PlayStation Network yet.   Stardust HD isn't perfect, of course. Its mode types are thin with only a few options to toy around with and there's little difference between them (~Planet Mode~ is just like ~Arcade Mode,~ only it allows you to play one world instead of five). Moreover, the two-player hot seat co-op is difficult to appreciate because sharing one screen means that your ship's mobility is extremely limited. There aren't any online goodies to speak of either (other than worldwide Leaderboards), so Stardust players will have to remain relatively inclusive should they want to team up with another person.   Then again, with as much fun as the single-player game is, what Stardust doesn't have is overshadowed by what it does.Over the last two years, there hasn't been a single arcade shooter that competes with the Xbox 360's Geometry Wars. Super Stardust HD, however, changes that with its addictively satisfying mechanics, great visuals and tactical yet simplistic design. In truth, and I say this as a heavy duty Geometry Wars player myself, Super Stardust HD is not only just as good as Bizarre Creation's it's in many ways better.", "date": "Jul 2, 2007"}
