The sequel to one of the most popular Playstation games ever, RE2 features more blood-oozing zombies than you can pump a shotgun at.  Like its predecessor, RE2 has finally worked its way onto the PC.  But also like the original, the Playstation version looks, plays and feels better than its PC cousin.  Resident Evil 2 puts you in control of Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop who has just been hired by the Raccoon City Police Department.  The opening animation depicts Leon rolling into town in his sporty white jeep.  He comes across a girl lying in the middle of the road and, being the inquisitive law enforcement agent he is and seeing as how all of the donut shops in town are closed, he stops to check out the scene.  That's when things get a little spooky.  It turns out the girl has been infected by Umbrella Corp's G-Virus, a genetic toxin that's turning the populace of Raccoon City into human-munchin' zombies.   As if one zombie trying to gnaw on his foot wasn't bad enough, Leon is jumped by a group of not so happy undead types who would like to do nothing more than make a meal out of the rookie cop's flesh.  Well Leon's a man who doesn't appreciate teeth marks in his shoulders (guess the Boom-Boom Club is out then) so he starts blasting the hell out of the zombie horde.  As if their grotesque appearance didn't give it away, Leon pumps umpteen bullets into the zombies before he realizes he's overwhelmed and hightails it down an alley.  As he's making his escape, a door swings open in front of him (this honestly scared the crap outta me and I had to excuse myself from work for the rest of the day ... but I'm sure Mr. Pickle will be writing about that soon enough).  He quickly turns his head and sees a non-zombiefied girl running away from--you guessed it--another zombie.  Leon caps the zombie in the head and he and the girl jump into a squad car and speed off toward the police station.  It turns out the girl is Clare Redfield.  She's in town looking for her brother Chris, who you might remember from the first installment of Resident Evil.  Well, as if their day wasn't exciting enough already, a zombie-piloted fuel-filled tanker truck comes barreling down the highway hell-bent on crushing Leon and Clare.  The tanker rams the squad car and explodes into a ball of billowing flame.  Zombie parts go flying, but somehow Leon and Clare escape unharmed.  The only problem is there's a burning truck between them.  Leon tells Clare to meet him at the police station and this is where you take over, in Leon's shoes trying to fight your way past the zombiefied Raccoon City citizentry.  If you've ever seen a copy of RE2 for the Playstation, you'll quickly realize that the PC version is a direct port of the game.  It's a shame that the design team didn't spend more time tweaking the PC translation a bit more because the game falls short on the computer.  Like the Playstation, gameplay boils down to shooting horde after horde after horde after horde-I think you get the point-of zombies.  You start out with a pistol and scramble to find more powerful weapons that will lay waste to your undead attackers.  You'll soon build an impressive arsenal, eventually having a shotgun, rocket launcher, and C4 explosives at your disposal, just to name a few.  The sheer number of zombies and the repetitive gameplay gets boring after a few hours and, if you've played Resident Evil, you've pretty much seen this all before.  Like the original, Resident Evil 2 has its share of puzzles to solve, but most of these are simple diversions which offer little challenge to even the most casual gamer. What is challenging about this game is finding the right damn key to continue progressing through each level.  As a whole, Resident Evil 2 has way too much backtracking to keep you interested for very long.  You'll have to go back to previously explored areas that were locked after you find the appropriate key, you'll have to go back to previously explored area when you find specific items to solve puzzles, and so on.  And after you clear an area the first time there are no more zombies to blast, so it just turns out to be a boring trek back down hallways you're all too familiar with by now ... until you try to remember which door uses the key you just found.  To make matters worse, you can only save your game at specified save points.  This is just something PC gamers are never going to get used to.  Any game developers listening out there?  I didn't think so because you continue to port console games over without adding any new save features.       In another frustrating twist, Resident Evil 2 also uses the same frustrating inventory management system as the original.  You can only carry a limited number of items (A very limited number ... as a matter of fact, Leon can only carry eight items, even if they all happen to be keys.  C'mon!!! I can carry more than eight keys in my left hand alone ... and Leon has loads of pockets).  You'll have to deposit excess items in storage boxes that are scattered throughout each level and save them for when you need them.  If you run across an area where you need a specific item and you don't happen to have it in your inventory, you have to backtrack to the closest inventory box and retrieve it.  Ahhh ... more backtracking with no action.  Gamer's love that, right?!?  Admittedly the PC version does have a few more gameplay options to choose from in the start menu than the Playstation version, but it's still just more of the same.  There's the Arrange mode where you can opt to begin the game with a machine gun rather than the puny pistol you usually start with and there's also an Extreme Battle mode where you start out at the end of the game and fight to work your way back to the beginning (Sounds kinda silly, eh?  Who would wanna fight their way back to a zombie filled town when they've reached the end?).  Graphically, Resident Evil 2 doesn't live up to its Playstation counterpart.  Whereas the backgrounds looked great in the Playstation version on a huge television, the textures on the PC are grainy and pixelated.  To make matters worse, the highest resolution you can play the game in is 640x480.  Sure, the characters and zombies look nice enough, but the poor backgrounds really take away from the game and it would have been nice to see Resident Evil 2 in hi-res for the PC.   I was impressed by Resident Evil 2 on the Playstation.  Unfortunately I can't say the same for the PC version.  It's just too shallow for the average PC gamer. With such little change over the Playstation version, it makes you wonder why it took Capcom three months to get this one out on the PC.  Sure, Resident Evil 2 has a cool backstory, lots of exploding zombies, and it will truly scare you in a few places, but it only satisfies hardcore gamers for a few hours at most.  If you want a truly good horror shooter, look in Half-Life's direction.   -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Mar 23, 1999"}
