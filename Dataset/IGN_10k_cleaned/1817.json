It's always nice to have a game once in a while that is completely story-driven and requires you to use your mind more than your hand-eye coordination.   In The Road to El Dorado, players join Tulio and Miguel, a pair of two-bit Spanish con artists, who are on a comedic tale of adventure and discovery that seemingly follows the same basic story path of the DreamWorks movies that saw a theatrical release in March 2000 in the United States. It's an enjoyable story, but the way it's presented in the game leaves a lot to be desired.   Gameplay The biggest problem is that the pace of the game is just much too slow. With games of this kind, it's important to quickly pull in the game player and keep him or her wanting to keep furthering along the storyline while challenging them with creatively designed puzzles. The Road to El Dorado simply doesn't do either of these important things.   The majority of the puzzles aren't that challenging on an intellectual level, but rather nonsensical in design and a bit overly tedious to actually carryout. Character control is a bit sluggish and while I applaud the developers for offering up two different control options, character relative (like Resident Evil) and screen relative (like Metal Gear Solid), it's just not executed that well.   Even for a graphical adventure game that doesn't require you to do anything too action-oriented, the response time of the characters just isn't up to snuff and needs a lot of work. All of this could have been made up for if the story was able to captivate the user, but that just doesn't happen here. The pace of the game is much too slow and there's nothing in the first three quarters of it that really encourage the player to play through the entire game (other than having to review it). While things to pick up in the last portion of the adventure, it's just not enough to save an otherwise boring quest.   Graphics It's too bad that the gameplay wasn't able to gratify us, because the game does have some things going for it. While the character models are sub par and aren't animated that well, the visuals on the whole are actually quite impressive. Some of the game's backgrounds are amazingly detailed and look better than what you'll typically find in your average PlayStation game. And this is definitely one of those games that see a substantial improvement when being played with the texture smoothing capabilities of the PlayStation 2.   Sound And what's even more impressive than the visuals, and probably the game's strongest quality, is it's fascinating audio. The general quality of the voice acting is top notch and the lines are all delivered quite nicely with good timing and presentation. The title also scores high marks for its excellent ambient sound effects and background music that really helps bring some of the environments to life and helps set the mood of the game.   If you're a big fan of graphical adventure games, then you might want to consider picking this up because it's one of the few new games in the genre that you'll find on PlayStation. However, don't do it expecting to get a good game, because it's just not one. The game's pacing is a bit too slow and tedious and the puzzles can be more nonsensical than challenging or difficult. While the voice acting is sensational and it does look pretty in some areas, these aren't good enough to warrant picking up this title.", "date": "Mar 6, 2001"}
