After some disappointing Happy Feet titles, what gamers really needed is a penguin game to dive in and save them. A game based on Luc Jacquet's Oscar-winning documentary, March of the Penguins, may have seemed like the perfect title for the job. Unfortunately, much like the dead baby penguins that are featured in the movie, this game is cold and lifeless.    March of the Penguins is one of those ~edutainment~ games that all children fear their parents will buy for them. Since the game is based on a documentary film (the stupidest premise for a game), there isn't too much of a story to tell. In between levels there is information about emperor penguin migration, which will try to tie in to the level. The funny thing is, the levels are usually wacky penguin-themed puzzles. So after the player reads something about the female penguins trekking back to the sea, they get to help the penguins bounce on tents and collect snowflakes (just like in the movie!).    The majority of the game is a Lemmings clone, with players guiding a dozen penguins across the treacherous, frozen landscape. Players use a variety of objects to aid the little aquatic birds in their journey. Snowballs, Ice bridges, ice stairs, and ice ramps all make sense, but it's the giant spiral ice slide and the tent that acts as a trampoline that seem to be out of place. The educational game based on a documentary has players creating elaborate funhouse style obstacle courses.    Asking players to suspend their disbelief isn't a big deal, if the rest of the game follows suit. However, most of the rest of the game is pretty straightforward and somewhat realistic. As mentioned earlier, each level has that educational tidbit, informing the players about the penguin's tenacity and courage, talking about how the birds are able to find their breeding ground every year even though it's really far away and everything looks the same in Antarctica. Then the game starts and there are a dozen retarded birds that don't know not to leap off a cliff.    March of the Penguins is not a total Lemmings rip off, there are a few differences. The first difference being that the penguins never die. If a hapless bird walks off a cliff edge and falls into the water it will just hop back up onto land at the beginning of the level. Since the levels all requite players to save every penguin, it means that one going off course won't destroy all chances of winning the level. The levels are timed though, so in many instances it doesn't matter since the clock runs out before the stragglers can finish.    A lot of the problem stems from the other feature in the game: snowflakes. Players must collect a set number of snowflakes scattered across the level. Usually this requires making the penguins go on more roundabout courses. There aren't enough items to go around (players only get a certain amount of tents, etc) so players have to strategically remove and replace the items farther down the path. Players can't pause the game and view the level to plan out their moves, which would have been helpful. These modes don't work too well, mostly because of lack of information. The explanation for each item is located in the manual and in a submenu, but it would have been better if it went over each tool before the game begins. If kids are expected to play this they have to know what they're doing. The levels are pretty challenging and probably a bit too hard for the average elementary school student, which is what this game seems to be geared for.       The other levels aren't near as difficult as the journeys, but they're just as unentertaining. Some levels have players guiding a penguin from snowbank to snowbank to find a mate. And one has the male penguin walking through a mazelike level, protecting his egg. The levels are bland and boring, more like chores to complete in between the real game levels. The developers tried to show every portion of the penguin's mating rituals, but was it really necessary to stretch a minute long portion of the film into multiple boring levels? There is a fairly entertaining swimming level, offering the most action in the game. Still, even this isn't enough to make this game a lot of fun. Educational games are a great idea; getting kids to learn something while having fun is an invaluable tool for teaching. This game is not fun. The game is too hard to be a children's game, and too boring to be a game to recommend to anyone. There are some morsels of mildly amusing gameplay, but for the most part it is a long, tiring, frustrating process. In that respect, Skyworks has really captured the experience of March of the Penguins.", "date": "Dec 15, 2006"}
