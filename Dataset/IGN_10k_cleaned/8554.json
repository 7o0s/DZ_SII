Despite contrary belief, playing with your monkey isn't as much fun as your older brother might suggest. Point in case? Monkey Hero: Take 2 and BLAM!'s latest title, a game that has unfortunately poked its way into the PlayStation mainstream.  Combing elements from RPGs and action titles, Monkey Hero offers little, if anything new over its predecessors whatsoever.  In fact, almost everything in this game seemed like a blatant rip-off of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, ranging from graphics to gameplay. Despite that, however, it doesn't seem to stack up in any kind of way shape or form. You'd think playing with your monkey would be a little more exciting than this, wouldn't you?  As your least-favorite simian romps his way through the huge worlds, he'll encounter a vast amount of characters, few which truly add anything to enhance the gameplay.  In fact, if anything, they're about as exciting as giving your grandmother a footbath, or licking a bucket full of hair mixed with three-year old applesauce.  In all honesty, they're quite boring and do little to make the game any more fun.  With dull villains like the Nightmares, as well as pointless creatures who ramble on about topicless subjects, Monkey Hero will make you wonder exactly why you're sitting down to play the game  especially when you could be whistling your way through an action-packed adventure of one of thousands of other games that would most definitely be better candidates for your time.  The graphics in Monkey Hero aren't anything to go over to your friend's house and brag about, either. The game has a look that is faintly reminiscent of Brave Fencer Musashi in some regards, yet much less detailed. Take 2 and BLAM!'s latest addition fails to impress, especially with such graphical flaws as clipping,  highly pixelated characters, and often sluggish framerates that make Jabba the Hutt look like Prefontaine.  In fact, the animation seems a little slow in many circumstances and even appears to be lacking some frames.  When Monkey attacks with his bamboo stick, for example, it just doesn't look 100% right. Perhaps the hit detection is off a bit, or the animation just refuses to click in perfect correspondence, but it just doesn't seem to fit like it should.  While it's easily overcome by mere seconds of playing, it still could have been tweaked until it was completely seamless.  And where do I begin with the control?  While it's completely fine with the normal directional pad, the analog is absolutely terrible!  It just doesn't work well at all, and the movements feel totally off altogether. If you can get through this game with using only the analog, then congratulations---But if you want to work your way through much more easily, use the directional buttons!  Other than that, there are few complaints.  Firing a spear or throwing a firecracker is simple, and if you've ever played any of the Zelda games which Monkey Hero so obviously copies from, then you're set without even having to think.  It'll be like a second nature to you!  To top it all off, the music is rather standard, and deathly repetitive.  If you're expecting a nicely-orchestrated symphonic soundtrack, or music that's been fully-licensed to include popular modern-day groups, then ask someone to hit you in the mouth with a pillowcase filled with quarters, because you have problems that even psychiatrists can't help.  If you can't tell by now, the music isn't very good. Sure, it's not terrible, but it feels uninspired, and it definitely could have been composed without having that ~Hey, I've heard this before in other games~ feel to it, which has been overdone to death over and over and over again.  It may feel as if Monkey Hero has few things about it which are actually good, but from my point of view, it lacks a whole lot.  Almost everything in this game seems to have appeared in a Zelda title of the past, and it certainly shows in many ways.  The firecrackers? Yeah, they're bombs.  How about the spears?  Yup, they're arrows.  Even the map and subcommand screens look like they were slighly altered copies of those from titles before it, except these are a bit more confusing and less user-friendly to use.  If only the designers strove for innovation instead of re-using and recycling old memories that other companies had created to try and sell their own games, Monkey Hero may have succeeded a little better. However, it tried to base its design on other peoples' creativity, and suffers deeply because of it.  I'd have to say that I'm honestly disappointed with this short stab in the adventure category.  What I expect as a gamer is something unique, something that actually changes, or at least hopefully improves upon the mistakes that other developers have made in the past.  Instead, I played something that just added onto the heap of things that could use change, and I feel that there should have been many things done to make Monkey Hero better than it actually is.  Unfortunately, some people just feel that they need to rush a game out in hopes that the public will eat it up, but when you see uninspired clone after uninspired clone in the gigantic flood of games that undoubtedly exists, it makes you wonder just why they even bothered to make something like Monkey Hero in the first place!  Why bother playing Monkey Hero when you could play something that's extremely fun out there, like Metal Gear Solid or the old Zeldas? If any of you are feeling like you deserve punishment, and you want to do something worse to yourself than eat a pound of broken glass, I have the perfect remedy!  Go to your nearest retailer and demand they sell you a copy of Monkey Hero, and you'll be set for ages!  Although it truthfully could be fun in several parts, it just doesn't stack up to the other next-generation games whatsoever.  If you're looking for a cute little Zelda-esque game on the PlayStation, then I still suggest you buy Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super NES. But if you want to buy a game just to use the disc and instruction booklet as toilet paper, I see no other better candidate out there than Monkey Hero!", "date": "Jun 16, 1999"}
