The newest breed is Mo-Pets, developed by Floodgate Entertainment and published by Sony BMG. Distinguishing itself from several other puppy sims of late (such as I-play's My Dog and Gameloft's Dogz), Mo-Pets offers multiple animals for you to interact with including cats, dogs, ferrets, and monkeys.   Immediately, Mo-Pets gains serious value by offering all of these animals. Not everybody is into dogs, so it's a pleasure to see an orange cat wandering across the screen -- or even better, an overly excited monkey. When you begin Mo-Pets, you can choose which of the four mammals you want to train and play with, give it a name, and then begin with some casual interaction. The ultimate goal of Mo-Pets, besides just having leisurely fun with your pet, is to enter a Talent Show and show off your animal's trained moves. The Talent Show is actually a network feature, so you can enter your cat against felines from your state or try out a national competition.   Winning the Talent Show takes time and practice, though. You must train your pet and maintain a happy relationship with it for some time before you can take home any medals. When you first get your pet, you can watch it frolic in the virtual living room and give it a small ball to chase around.   To maintain the animal's happiness, you can pet it by pressing sequences on the number pad. The sequences are meant to simulate a directional stroke, so pressing 1-4-7 would pet the animal straight down. These pets can be finicky, though, so you'll have to experiment with how they like to be petted. Pet the wrong way, and the animal's happiness rating drops. Find the critter's sweet spot, and you'll get double the happiness of a successful stroke. One thing I found odd about this was that the directional petting doesn't necessarily match up with the animal's actual preferences. When I was petting my virtual cat, I pet it using 3-2-1, going from back to front. The digital cat loved it, but anybody that owns a real cat likely has the scars to prove that cats really don't like their fur rubbed the wrong way.   Sometimes, the pet will act up and you must scold it with a virtual wagging finger. Immediately scold the pet after misbehaving, such as going potty inside the house or lunging aggressively, to earn a better obedience rating. A mannered animal does better at the Talent Show, trust me. I did the bare minimum to train my cat for the Talent Show and that little SOB didn't listen to me at all. When it came time to jump, he just flopped down and went to sleep. Two points for realism, at least.   Happiness can also be affected by offering treats. Treats are earned by flawlessly running through an obstacle course at the local park. Using the thumb pad, you tell your animal when to weave around cones, jump over hurdle, duck through tunnels, and leap over water puddles. If you hit the command at just the right time, you'll see a green sparkle and earn extra points. Use the treats to give your pet some extra energy after practicing the obstacle course or during a training exercise. You can also reward the pet with a treat when you catch them doing something good on their own, such as one of the moves you teach them during training.   When you enter the training minigame, two lines of scrolling icons go across the top of the screen. Hit the right soft key when a colored circle crosses a mark in the middle of the screen. If you tap three or four of the same colored circle in a row, the pet performs that trick, such as crawling or jumping. The colors are all mixed up, so you have to wait for the right sequence to properly teach your animal. Energy is used while training, though, so you cannot just hang there and wait for the most opportune moment. Complicating manners are the icons running above the colored circle. The roll at a different pace, and if you tap a colored circle at the same time one of the icons crosses the center mark, you receive the effect of the icon. Sometimes you hit a bonus icon and the pet learns the trick faster, sometimes you get a bum icon and the pet loses extra energy.   Unfortunately, all of the pets have the exact same moves save for one special trick each. The cat does a back flip, the ferret does a handstand, the dog does a classic roll-over, and the monkey dances. If you download Mo-Pets, you have to try the monkey at least once. His dancing is awesome. I wish the pets acted differently on a greater scale. I own both a dog and some cats and can tell you these animals are night-and-day different.   Still, there's quite a bit going on in Mo-Pets. It doesn't quite have the depth of moods as I-play's excellent My Dog and I found it odd that you never really have to feed or water the animals -- just give them the occasional treat. This is mainly just a play time sim, so if you're looking for a deeper interactive experience, I'd definitely point you to My Dog. But the animal choices and the excellent Talent Show feature are strong reasons to check Mo-Pets out.   Floodgate Entertainment did a good job with the look of the game. Each animal has some fun animations. The game is pretty colorful. And the writing is good, too, as the judges at the Talent Show will toss one-liners back and forth, especially when your pooch doesn't perform as expected.  Mo-Pets is a nice addition to the virtual pet genre for a few reasons. Not only do you get more than just a dog, you get a pet simulator where you don't necessarily feel too guilty about spending time away from it. For busy people, that's cool. (I felt horrible when my puppy in My Dog was sad.) You can just get in here, mess around, and watch your animals have fun. But if you want to go for the gold, you're going to need to put some time into training and obedience. There's nothing more embarrassing than an animal that doesn't listen, especially if you enter a national competition.", "date": "Jan 24, 2007"}
