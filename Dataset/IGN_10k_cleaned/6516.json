You'll click on the link, play it for two minutes, chuckle for a couple of seconds, then quit to tell your mom how funny and stupid it was for her to send it to you. Now imagine that same concept as a game you have to physically go to the store and pay for. Exactly.  Elf Bowling is pretty much a videogame version of a Saturday Night Live sketch: one joke that's just goes on for far too long, and you're just sitting there agonizing and hoping the horror will get betteror just cut to commercial.    Elf Bowling made the e-mail link rounds about this time more than a half decade ago. It was a game created in the early days of Flash and ran in an Internet Explorer browser window. It didn't require a whole lot of processing power, and the design was more for a joke than it was as an example of addictive gameplay. I mean, you're Santa, rolling a ball and knocking over elves like pins. That joke was meant to last for exactly one game, and the creator would most likely have considered himself lucky if someone played this one-click game for more than a few frames. I can't imagine that Elf Bowling took any more than a week or two to develop, and because it was a free download the less time in the development cooker, the better. It was more about the recognition anyway.   Like any success story, Elf Bowling's viral triumph encouraged the creator to design a sequel to the crudely developed original. Elf Bowling 2: Elves in Paradise takes the Santa Hates Elves theme from bowling to shuffleboard. And again, this game was more meant as a viral email joke than it was an actual, playable game. But by the time the sequel hit, the whole joke wore itself out and what you're left with is an even cruder action game that's far staler than the original. But again, it was free. No harm, no foul.   Now, some ingenious publisher has decided to take the games out of their five-year-old ~download only~ status, and bring the game to the handheld massesfor a price. It's clear that the team spent about as much time on the Nintendo DS version as I did in writing this review. Nintendo's seal of quality has really gone to crap if they let this one through without a problem. Asking me which Elf Bowling game in Elf Bowling 1 & 2 is better is like me asking you if you'd rather eat a spoonful of rat turds or hamster turds. They're both god awful and have no right ever being pressed to a Nintendo DS cartridge. Look, we can understand that some games are good in a bad way, and some nasty-looking games can fall back on its gameplay. But there are standards here, people.    The original Elf Bowling has less control and gameplay than a single level in Wario Ware: you just hit the action button when the aim arrow is in the proper place on the alley, and the ball crashes into the stack of elves. You can't move Santa to throw the ball at a different angle, nor can you apply any spin on the ball to attack the ~pins~ with more effort. You just tap the screen and throw. The physics are completely scripted, so hitting the same notch on the aim bar will result in the same stack of elves at the other end of the alley. Once you learn where the ~sweet spot~ is, that's the game. 300s almost all the time.   And then we've got Elf Bowling 2, which contains some of the worst sprite effects in any videogame featuring a first-person perspective published after 1989. The elves slide along the alley at a different speed as the scrolling of the surface. This lack of attention flew on the PC because it was free. On the Nintendo DS it looks absolutely retarded and the laziness borderlines on insulting.Look, these Nintendo DS games even lack the ability to actually quit the action back to the main menu, which shows just how much effort went into these ports. Hint: it wasn't much. It's a single-chuckle joke that's extended into a 20 dollar purchase. And once that laugh is expelled, you're left two of the crappiest games ever developed on the Nintendo DS platform. Merry Christmas.", "date": "Dec 15, 2005"}
