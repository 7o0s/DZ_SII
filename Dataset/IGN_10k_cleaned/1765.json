The DC version of Ubi Soft's platformer stood as one of the best games released on Sega's dying platform and was arguably one of the best games ever released in the 3D platforming genre. With this, the PlayStation 2 version of Rayman 2, the limb-less hero is getting one of his best chances to be in the limelight.   For the most part, the game is essentially the exact same thing that we've already played on the Nintendo 64, PC, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. There are some new levels and the gameplay has been enhanced quite a bit in some areas, but it's still just another version of Rayman 2 and people that have played previous versions of the game probably won't find enough here to warrant an entirely new purchase.   Gameplay  The game puts you in control of one of the greatest videogame mascot characters that has ever been thought up, Rayman. Little Ray is an odd little creature that doesn't have any legs, arms or even a neck. His head, two hands and two feet are magically attached to his body via some sort of unexplainable invisible force. His character design is insanely original and this originality and level of creativeness goes well beyond just the design of the character.   At the game's onset, Rayman can perform a variety of simple including running, jumping, strafing, hanging onto ledges, climbing between walls, and use his ears like a helicopter to float in the air. However, unlike the other versions of the game where he had even more skills at the start of the quest, the PS2 incarnation of Rayman is a bit limited in his ability range in the beginning.   Whereas he could fire quickly and had more powers at the start of the other games, the PS2 Rayman has a much more gradual progression with his powers. Things like increasing the rate of fire, adding the ability of shots to bounce off of the walls or enemies, doing powered-up shots, and running while carrying kegs, much be either upgraded at the Magic Well (shop that lets you buy power-ups) or discovered during the quest.   The level of progression with the power-up abilities appears really refined and doesn't seem as if it were just thrown into the game to make it different from the previous releases. This goes well with the fact that the levels that players are presented with in Rayman 2 are some of the most masterful and well-crafted in platforming history. There's a near-perfect blend of standard platforming with vehicle-based levels that have users doing things like water skiing or riding a bull-like missile.   And not only are there a lot of different level types, but the play mechanics implemented are also quite innovative at times. Levels will have Rayman carrying barrels from one spot to another and require him to do things like throw the barrel straight up in the air so he can shoot some enemies and then catch it before it hits the ground. It's little things like this that really make this one of the best of its kind. Quite simply, Rayman 2 stands as the pinnacle of 3D platform game design. And if these words weren't enough to convince you, we suggest that you read through Brandon Justice's review of the Dreamcast version of Rayman, where he did a splendid job of explaining just how well designed this game really is.   Graphics  Considering that Rayman 2: Revolution wasn't programmed specifically for the PlayStation 2 platform, as Criterion's RenderWare 2 was apparently used to help port the game over, it looks surprisingly good. On the downside, the game suffers from some slowdown problems that weren't apparent in the Dreamcast game, which had a rock solid 60 frames per second framerate throughout, and the quality of the grass and background textures are nowhere as detailed. While on the other hand, its overall look is as good, if not even a little bit better, than any other version of the game.   The colors used in the game have a much brighter and vibrant look to them, so much so that it seems like it might have been a clear-cut attempt by the developers to give an even more cartoonish look and feel. There are also all-new lighting effects and Rayman actually casts a realtime shadow instead of the bland circular shadow that appeared below him in his previous outings. And many of the background elements that were simple textures before are now fully realized 3D polygonal objects. It's not a groundbreaking leap forward in visual presentation, but when taken altogether is definitely a progressive step forward in the game's technical level presentation.   It's also worth noting that Rayman, himself, looks better than ever in this game than ever before. His polygonal model has much smoother edges and he appears to be more rounded and alive thanks to better texturing and lighting on his body. The differences, however, are quite minute and most people won't notice it unless they go back and forth between both versions on a switchbox.   Even with the plusses, such as the brighter colors, additional 3D background objects, better looking character models, and improved lighting, one can't help but think of the Dreamcast version as the better looking of the two games. While the PS2 game might have some things that make it look a little better in certain areas, it has more graphical flaws like slowdown and seaming problems between polygons in the backgrounds. Rayman 2 looks great on PS2, but it was definitely much more polished on Dreamcast.   Sound The game's soundtrack and background effects seem identical to the Dreamcast version of the game, which means that it simply kicks a whole lot of butt. The musical score features some of the best tunes that you'll ever encounter in a game of this type and it's made even better by the wondrous and completely ambient background noises and sound effects.   The only real noticeable change between this and the previous versions of the game (not counting Rayman 2 for the PlayStation) is the addition of character voices in English, Spanish and French. While some people might feel nostalgic about the incomprehensible speech that accompanied the text in the old Rayman games, the voice acting used here has been done amazingly well and helps give the user a feeling of being in a cartoon-like world. And if that's just not your thing, Ubi Soft has left in the option of playing the game with the Raymanian speak, so there's really nothing at all to complain about here. If you love the voices in English (or French or Spanish) you can have them and if you don't like them, you can go without. It's always cool to have the option. If you already own the Dreamcast version of Rayman, the additions that have been made to Rayman 2: Revolution for the PlayStation 2 aren't really enough to warrant buying the same again. However, considering that neither Rayman 2 nor the Dreamcast have sold that well, most of you probably haven't had the pleasure of experiencing this platforming masterpiece and this would make a perfect time to pick the game up. Even though it's not quite as solid as the Dreamcast version, which ran at a steady 60 frames per second and didn't have any real noticeable graphical glitches, the PS2 game does have plenty of new enhancements and improvements in other areas that make it a comparable title. It can be argued that it's a better game and it's conceivable that some could think of it as an inferior title, but I personally think of it more as a different, but equal, game. Accordingly, if you have yet to experience the platforming brilliance that is Rayman 2, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up. It's one of the greatest achievements in the history of 3D platform games and should be given the same admiration given to titles like Miyamoto's Mario 64.", "date": "Feb 6, 2001"}
