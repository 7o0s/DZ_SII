It all began with an initial attack on a lunar establishment, but that proved to be just the beginning, as then the aliens set about establishing a permanent base in the Arctic.  The Earth's governments decided to take action, beginning work on construction of the Anomaly Detection and Tracking Array (ADATA) in the African peaks near Mount Kilimanjaro, but as work on the array was finishing up, the aliens detected the upcoming threat and sent forces to put a stop to mankind's only hope for defense.  This is where you begin playing Incoming, Rage's PC to DC port that was released to Japan as one of the DC's first titles, and has just now arrived on US store fronts through Interplay.  So where does this multi-vehicle 3D shooter stand in the ranks of Dreamcast software?  Right in the middle, actually.  Although the game is lacking in many areas, there's more than enough here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action. Incoming isn't actually a mindless shooter.  The action takes place across six scenarios, each containing ten missions, with each mission having its own objective, ranging from protecting planes and ships to taking out targets.  All missions in a given scenario are linked together, so you'll go from one mission to the next in a (usually) smooth transition, without any gaps.  Here's the twist on this tried and true technique, though.  Each mission requires that you pilot a particular vehicle, whether it be a helicopter, futuristic jet, tank, or even a gun turret.  This adds a tremendous variety to the gameplay, as each vehicle has a different control scheme that suits it best.  The helicopter, for instance, has buttons for rising and descending, with the analogue pad's UP and DOWN used for moving forward and backwards.  The jet planes, however, use a separate button for accelerating, reserving the analogue pad for adjusting the plane's direction - just like you'd expect of a flying game.  The controls took some getting used to at first, and I found yourself swearing about how difficult it was to make the helicopter do exactly what I wanted, but after having given it some time, I managed to adapt.  What I wasn't able to get used to, though, is the odd flying model for the planes.  The flying seems too slow, and is a bit too unrealistic.  As mentioned, one button is used to make the planes accelerate - or, rather, move forward.  Another button is used to make the planes move backwards.  I wasn't expecting a realistic flight model by any means, but the non-helicopter sequences at times feel more like a sort of point and click shooter in the third dimension.  The other vehicles behave as they should though, and I'm actually hoping that someone will make an arcade game based off the gun turret sequences.  The overall sense of control is there, certainly a lot better than in Expendable.  That's a good thing, as if it's one thing this game needs, it's control.  Incoming is a real man's game through and through, as progressing beyond even the third scenario requires balls of steel - and this is on the game's easy setting (yes, once proud Anoop, who passed Lords of Thunder on ~Devil Mode,~ was reduced to using the ~easy~ setting in order to play this game).  You have to be quick and careful in your firing, taking out as many targets as possible and using an occasional bit of stealth in order to avoid being bombarded by enemy bullets.  Missions that require you to protect a ship from enemy attack are the hardest, as you have to make sure not to take out the ship yourself.  And then there are the missions that require you to protect multiple objects.  I'm not even gonna go there!  The game, unfortunately, does little to help ease things.  First off, the mission briefings are very vague, telling you only, for instance, to protect a ship or an oil rig.  Of course, when you find out that there are two oil rigs that you were supposed to be protecting (usually once the one you'd neglected to protect gets destroyed, thus ending the mission), you may find yourself somewhat frustrated.  Furthermore, the graphics can get in the way at times, as the draw in distance is often too low for you to actually see the second oil rig unless you explore a bit.  But, of course, exploring will make you move away from the first oil rig, leading to its being destroyed.  Things would have been a lot simpler if the designers had given us a pre-mission map of some sort.  There's more frustration to be found due to various problems in game design.  In one section, for instance, you have to destroy ice bergs before they strike an oil rig.  The problem is that it's difficult to pinpoint exactly where you need to hit the ice bergs.  In fact, it's easier to just ram your jet into them, and, oddly enough, the game doesn't penalize you with damage for this.  There are other examples of this, some leading to a good deal of frustration that may make you want to stop playing the game forever.  But, if you're a hardcore-enough shooting fan, you'll keep going . . . and going and going and going until 4:00 AM, despite the fact that you have work the following day.  Ahem . . ..  It's true that the problems mentioned above, along with a bit of classic first-generation glitchiness here and there, and a soundtrack that does nothing to add drama to the game (my score would have been considerably higher if the game had featured a more distinct score),  keep it from the top of the pack, but if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're looking for a good challenge, you'll probably want to look into Incoming.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 4, 1999"}
