However, there is such a thing as going too far when it comes to multiplayer capacity, and the folks at Segasoft may have discovered the limit. While it is a fantastic proposition to have 1,000,000 players competing in the same virtual world for a finite amount of territory, the frustrating interface and labored visual output present in 10Six may send many fans running back to their tried and true favorites.  The background story here is pretty straightforward. At some point in the near future, a planetoid enters our solar system from regions unknown. Scientists soon discover, through their magical, scientific crystal ball I guess, that this planetoid contains a new resource called Transium. This substance apparently can be processed to supply an abundant energy source for those that have the know-how. Four ultra-powerful corporations on Earth have that knowledge, and intend to use it. Each company has colonized the planetoid, dubbed 'Visitor', in the hopes of mining their own Transium and denying the mineral from others. Gotta love good old-fashioned competition.  As a neophyte miner, you'll enter the game with a set of technological wonders called ~jitters~ at your disposal. These mechanisms control everything that you will be able to do in your camp, from building structures to creating and upgrading units. You simply won't be able to live without these little buggers. Starting things off, you'll use your very first jitter to create a Nerve Center. This is simple enough but things get progressively more complicated.  After the Nerve Center construction, a good portion of your jitters must be stored there before they can be utilized in any way. Once stored, jitters for different buildings can be selected and used to produce their corresponding facilities. Some of your jitters must take up residence in these structures if you want the structures to function at all. Weapons Plants, Warehouses, Lookout Towers, and many other buildings can be thrown together, but the correct jitter must be stored in the correct position in order to do it. Though the process could be simplified with a more traditional interface, this still isn't that bad. However, we're just getting warmed up.  Once a Rover Plant is built, you can begin producing your first vehicles. Of course, you'll have to have the correct jitters to make those vehicles, but we'll talk about that in a minute. Once you've got them in place, upgrading them in the future requires not only that the proper devices be owned and contained in the proper buildings, but also that the Rover intended for enhancement be present at the plant. While somewhat logical in its own right, the process seems awfully tedious when laid next to the more mundane manner in which things are upgraded in other RTS games. It almost seems to be designed in such a way that tasks which could be completed in a relatively short period are instead engineered to require much more of a time investment than necessary. However, admittedly, with a fair degree of hours spent learning this odd structure, things begin to run with more fluidity than at the beginning.  The jitters from which your forces are derived can be obtained through a few different means. Although you'll start with a handful of them at the beginning of the game, you'll need to increase your stock to stand any chance of survival. You can swap the Transium you'll be mining for hard cash. The exchange rate for this transaction depends (among other things) on how many camps you currently operate. The cash gained at this point can be used to purchase jitters to swell your ranks. Though these paths are certainly useful for advancing yourself, you'll find that many more powerful jitters can become yours by incorporating a little brute force. Leading a successful raid against an enemy camp yields whatever jitters you can grab, and can therefore be an extremely efficient way of increasing your potential while simultaneously putting the screws on your adversaries.  Actual combat is also a bit different than your everyday RTS fare. Entry to another person's camp is handled via a teleport matrix, which every camp must build if you wish to invade anyone. Battles can be handled via a 1st or 3rd person view, while camp maintenance can be done through an overhead perspective camera. While the first two offer a unique, battlefield commander feel when involved in a raid, the overhead view has a much more traditional look that hardened gamers may find more useful. Unfortunately, no matter which view you choose, things are going to look significantly less pretty than you may hope. It would appear that several corners had to be cut with regards to the graphics and sound departments in 10Six in order to accommodate the truly gargantuan number of possible players. Though framerates are high enough while moving around your camp, visual quality still seems awfully low for a 3D accelerated game of our time. Also, when combat does ensue, things get a little choppy thanks to everyone's favorite multiplayer nuisance - LAG.  However, despite these flaws, all of your standard strategy elements are present here, along with a few extras. Units can be ordered to move, attack, patrol, and everything else as usual. Your avatar on the other hand has the unique ability to travel the map, firing his own weapons, while still issuing orders to the army. This is a somewhat different approach than the norm, since you as the player typically don't have a persona to control on the battlefield. Again, this requires some getting used to, and may not appeal to those used to more traditional strategy games, but things do get easier with time. Also, for those who are worried about being attacked shortly after signing on for the first time, you needn't start sweating quite yet. Until you choose to raid another player, you will be protected from the onslaught of opposing forces. Generally speaking, a kind of 'newbie barrier' is erected when you first enter the game that keeps other players out until you deem that you are ready to face them. Just don't make the decision too early, or you will surely be trounced.  Perhaps the most important aspect of the game lies not in city building or combat, nor in the never-ending search for powerful jitters, but in communication. It is absolutely vital to the success of your campaign that you join an MDN, or Mutual Defense Network. Essentially, this is a guild of unified players dedicated to the advancement and survival of everyone within their ranks. Organized raids can be planned using a specific MDN chat channel, and the revenge of your compatriots can be brought down on enemies who manage to penetrate your defenses. The goal of course is to not let your camp be annihilated and then call for help, but instead to get assistance at the first indication of an attack. This can be handled by pressing the MDN Alert button on your interface. Doing so notifies all members of your force that your region is under attack and that you require assistance. It is of course up to the individual members whether or not they wish to help you, so try to find a group that you can rely on, especially in the early stages. If at any point your camp gets totally inhabited by an enemy legion, and your Avatar is destroyed, you will lose your camp.  10Six certainly offers something fresh to the gaming world with an off kilter style of play that hasn't quite been done before. However, a few factors taint the surface of Visitor that may make it unplayable for some gamers. The lackluster graphics and sound effects are certainly a turn off, but could be forgiven in favor of immersive gameplay and an obscene number of fellow players. The biggest stain that hurts this package though is the harsh learning curve that you're in for if you decide to sign up. Several users probably will never get past it, and those that do may underestimate their enemies' forces and end up taking a dirt nap quite early in the adventure. It seems just a hair too complicated and tedious to have widespread appeal. However, to those who are die hard enough to persevere through the first few agonizing days or weeks of learning time, a happy home may be found on Visitor.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Jul 1, 2000"}
