Until recently, though, none have ever successfully emulated sports realistically. Sure, the rules are the same: six points for a touchdown, you have to hit the ball inside the white lines, no more than three steps without a dribble, and so on.  But gameplay has never been so good as to truly feel like the sport it's supposedly imitating. Instead, sports games -- both on PC and consoles -- have been their own self-contained games, with gameplay mechanics varying immensely between titles.  No more. NHL 2001 marks the first time that the PC gamer can buy a game, install it on his or her computer, and sit down to actually play hockey. Not a game that looks like hockey, not something vaguely resembling hockey, but hockey. Elbow-smashing, stick-wielding, gut-wrenching, bell-ringing hockey.  Bar none, NHL 2001 is the best computer hockey game of all-time. That's not exactly big news, since its immediate predecessor was the one to beat, and it would be silly of EA Sports to release an inferior sequel. But by leaps and bounds, 2001 beats all other previous efforts, scoring a hat trick with hockey fans in the process.   The opening montage, highlights from the 1999-2000 season set to Collective Soul's ~Heavy,~ sets the tone early. The graphics are crisp and crystal clear, and better than ever. The players' faces actually look human, and I recognize even the most obscure players on my favorite teams. Their bodies, while still rendered and three-dimensional, finally look real instead of polygonal. The crowd looks more authentic than ever, with each person better defined. The coaches scream and yell after a big penalty or a close goal, leaning over the bench and shaking their fists. Even the players seem genuine, taking off their gloves to scratch themselves between plays, or leaning over the bench to cheer on their team after a close save.  Camera angles have also been improved, and replays of some goals actually look like good hockey, the kind you'd want to play or at least watch on television.  There's a make-your-own-jersey feature for those who like that kind of stuff, and the use-your-own-face element that never seemed to work last year still doesn't seem to work right, leaving you with a distorted face that looks little like your real-life persona.  As usual, the sound of the latest in EA's NHL series is perfect. Besides featuring the same strengths, NHL 2001 scores on two big improvements. First, the game environment feels extremely real. The crowd noise varies perfectly proportionally to the immediate success of the home team, with just the right balance of loud music and corny announcements between after the whistle. Everything comes together to make the experience as genuine as can be.   In addition, the announcing is not only superior, it's better than any sports announcing to date. The analysis is pertinent, logical, and intelligent. After a goal, the color commentator actually picks up on what led to the goal  a great pass or shot, one too many rebounds -- and uses it to describe replay. During boring stretches, the announcers chat about the histories of prospects of various players. Did you know that Boston Bruins' goaltender Byron Dafoe was born in Sussex, England, and named after famous British poet Lord Byron? Even if you did, you'd still probably be surprised to hear the color guy then put on a British accent and read some of Byron's poetry  that's a nice touch, even if it is a bit corny.  All subsequent analysis is equally relevant and interesting. When describing the reasons a team has lost or is losing a game, no longer are the same tired reasons used. Such details as the productivity of a team's top scorer, the number of penalties taken and whether powerplay goals were scored or not, or even whether goals were preceded by lots of passing, are all used to describe the game. They even know all the teams' strengths and weaknesses, noting for example when the Boston Bruins score a goal with a man advantage that powerplay goals are their specialty. Commentary during the game is less repetitive, with more comments distributed more smoothly, so that announcers aren't yelling out ~what a hit!~ over and over again. Of course, the cheesy lines are still common, but what's hockey without lines like, ~if he keeps making saves like that, he's going to be charged with robbery?~  Gameplay in the latest of the NHL series is just as strong. For the first time, bad stick-handlers actually feel awkward to play instead of just being slow with the puck. Brawlers actually have advantages, more easily scoring big hits and effective checks, not to mention winning more fights and sending opposing players to the hospital. Different kinds of checks -- pokes, hips -- allow other players to be effectively physical, too. Other player stats are also well executed, as guys with stronger shots actually score more with a slap shot, instead of simply shooting harder. Deeking is also a more useful move than ever, allowing a single player to beat out the defense and the goalie -- if he's good enough. Fighting is more fun than it's ever been.  It's quick, and less painful than a bonafide bleeding nose. It beats the ancient fighting system, where the winner didn't suffer a penalty. The learning curve in this game is also superior to previous efforts: easy to learn and play at first, but with higher levels of difficulty more challenging than ever, which makes for extremely good extended play value.  There's Internet play, and with the recent rise in popularity of fast connections, it's getting better. Still, there's nothing like sitting around with a live friend (or a few, if you've got a LAN) and breaking your opponent's back with your stick. As great Canadian commentator Don Cherry would say, ~it's rock 'em, sock 'em hockey.~  Surprisingly, the biggest leap may be the play of computer-controlled teammates. For once, they're actually behaving like hockey players. If you're playing center and you rush to the left side to deek out a defenseman, in NHL 2001 your left-winger will zip out to center and get ready to receive your upcoming pass. This kind of realism opens the door for powerplay strategy, solid one-timers, and even drop passes. Also, the typical 'trick goals' like around-the-net shots or lame deeks no longer work. The momentum feature, in which a team's big hits or shots on goal serve to propel and motivate them and this motivation is displayed on a bar in the corner, is also cool, as is the crowd's appropriate reaction to its team getting hot -- cheering wildly.  Even the AI is better, something that couldn't be said about the previous game. The opposing team changes its style depending on whether it's ahead (defensive), tied, or behind (aggressive). If they're having trouble getting shots off, they'll stop being picky, even shooting from the neutral zone if they have to. If you check an opposing player after the whistle, as some gamers love to do, you may find one of that player's friends rushes over to return the favor.  Checking the ref proved to be impossible, but that's about the only flaw to the game. Well, that and my coach changes lines (when on auto mode) during the rush sometimes, which isn't too bright.  Finally, there's a solution for introverted folks who can't skate or don't get along well with others. Buy NHL 2001, and you can either play to your heart's content, never longing for actual ice hockey again, or you can hone your skills at home on your PC until you get so good, no local team would turn you down. Next stop, the real National Hockey League  that is, if you can tear yourself away from NHL 2001.    -- Eric Benner      Want to share your opinions with the world?
