{"name": "SEGA Rally Revo", "name_review": "SEGA Rally UK Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/09/17/sega-rally-uk-review", "text": "Judging by the raft of next-gen racing games released this year any developer considering entering the genre will need to meet strict criteria just to match the competition. A super-realistic damage engine? Check. A customisation tool that makes Photoshop look like Mario Paint? You bet. And more cars than Tim Westwood? Absolutely. With this in mind, does SEGA Rally stall at the starting grid, considering it lacks these pretty much all of these vital criteria? Thankfully, no. You see, while it may have none of the above what it lacks in extras it makes up for with an extremely enjoyable racing experience that's more thrilling than Richard Hammond's driving career.   Of course, this should be expected from a series that's prided itself on arcade action rather than spot-on physics, but since the game was announced we've always had this niggling concern that perhaps it couldn't compete with the super realism of other next-gen racers. However, when you're barreling through an alpine valley with the blue sky above your head and the gravel flying underneath your tyres, sliding past an opponent on a hairpin bend - all accompanied by a blast of rousing trumpets from a pumping soundtrack - it's hard not to break out in an inane speed-loving grin.   Driving on snow is a mix or risk and reward because it's easy to spin out.  What SEGA Rally does so well is let the racing experience shine through. The single-player sees you choosing from three championships - Premier, Modified and Masters - before selecting a tournament (made up of three or four races) and deciding what car you want to drive. You can also select from the fairly standard time attack and quick race modes too.   No matter what you choose, within minutes of loading the game you'll be zipping around a sun-drenched tropical landscape in a Subaru Impreza, without ever worrying about tweaking suspension or modifying the gear box. In fact the only car customisation options are a selection of unlockable liveries and choosing whether you want to hit the track with a pre-set off-road or road set-up. Of course, for some this level of simplicity may be a turn off and that's one of Rally's potential drawbacks - it cannot compete with the likes of Colin McRae: DiRT or Forza Motorsport 2 on a technical, tinkering level. Indeed, the drought of options may feel decidedly last generation to some wanting a more in-depth rally experience.   Other cars overtaking you should become a common sight in later stages.  However, any SEGA Rally fan knows that the experience is more about fast racing thrills than beneath-the-bonnet tweaking and in that respect the latest in the series is on the money. From the moment you slam down the accelerator Rally's handling is spot-on - you can feel every movement of the car, whether you're feathering the brakes around a long curve or letting your back-end slide out on a particularly tricky hairpin. It's an incredibly rewarding experience because once you've mastered the controls, which takes half a dozen races or so, you really do feel as though you're at one with your car. Admittedly it doesn't feel quite so sharp in the third-person view because it's much harder to gauge when to adjust your racing line, but stick to the first-person view - which is faster and in our opinion looks better anyway - and SEGA Rally really does handle superbly.    In addition to great handling SEGA Rally benefits from dynamic deformable surfaces, which constantly change to make every lap different from the last. Tyres dig into the track and carve grooves through the mud as you drive and the longer the race continues the deeper the grooves become, providing more grip. What's more, each racing surface - snow, sleet, sand, mud, water and gravel - feels distinctly unique and you actually feel the change in handling as you switch between them, with tyres biting harder when driving from snow to tarmac and so on. Furthermore, the dynamic surfaces are much more than an aesthetic nicety too, because the forever-changing track genuinely affect races meaning you've got to keep an eye surface at all times, to make sure you're taking the best racing line.   This is something the opposing drivers do with unnerving skill, so much so you'll be left at the back of the pack if you make a single mistake. Indeed, it often feels like AI drivers are too good at following the racing line and as you progress through the championships you'll often be chasing specks on the horizon just to catch up. You see, although the AI does start off easy enough it quickly ramps up and by the final stages it's frustratingly unbeatable, unless you race perfectly.   Each track is expertly designed and they look fantastic.  There's one benefit to cruising along in last place though - you have the time to admire the tracks, which are an absolute joy to behold. It's refreshing to see a racing game that's so unashamedly arcadey, with bold blue skies and lush tropical landscapes bursting with colour - subdued is certainly not a word you'd use to describe SEGA Rally. Indeed, we'd much rather enjoy Rally's lush jungles, complete with parrots and rice fields, than drive around yet another bland, forgettable track in Germany, even if every bend has been accurately mapped. What's more, the design of the courses is excellent with every track is a thrilling mix of jumps, water hazards and tight corners. There's no hint of slow-down either, even with six racers on screen and mud flying everywhere.   It's a shame, however, that there are so few tracks in the game. From the beginning there are five different areas available - safari, alpine, tropical, canyon and artic - and each has three tracks. Completing championships unlocks mirrored versions of the same courses, alongside some secret tracks, but we can't help but feel a bit short-changed by the number on offer.   Deformable surfaces are a great addition to the traditional SEGA Rally formula.  Multiplayer is accomplished. As well as offering a split-screen two-player there's a decent online mode too, with up to six players racing at once. What's more, if you're short on trash-talking pals to race against you can add AI racers, then increase or decrease the difficulty levels to match your skill. Having churned mud against a mix of AI and human players we can confidently say we never experienced a hint of lag during the race, which is exactly how an online driving game should be.SEGA Rally is a refreshing break from realistic driving sims then. It's got an arcade engine throbbing under its bonnet which makes the game challenging and fun in equal measure. Indeed, SEGA Driving Studio has pulled off the impossible by capturing the essence of the original series and combining it with advanced in-game effects made real by next-gen technology. Whats more, this is all accompanied by a robust online multiplayer that runs without lag and offers plenty of extra longevity. In fact Rallys only downfall is that there isnt much outside of the core racing experience - theres no customisation, no damage engine and nothing to indicate the different performance stats of each car, which could put off Forza or DiRT fans. If SEGA Driving Studio had gone the extra mile and included some of these features and perhaps a few more tracks then this could have easily been the out-and-out leader of the racing pack. As it is, it just misses out on pole position.", "date": "Sep 17, 2007"}
