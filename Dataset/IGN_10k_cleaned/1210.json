{"name": "Broken Helix", "name_review": "Broken Helix", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/05/30/broken-helix", "text": "It probably started out as a good idea. Take a third-person action title, which are very popular these days, hire Bruce Campbell, the star of the Evil Dead movies, to do voice-overs, and place it in the mysterious, yet trendy, Area 51. It may seem like a promising recipe, but it falters from some basic gameplay flaws.  A civilian scientist working at Area 51 has gone off the deep and has set up bombs all over the base. The wise-cracking Jake Burton (aka Bruce Campbell) must infiltrate the base without being detected by roving security cameras, defuse the bomb, and find out what's going on. And, if it's Area 51, you just know some slimy aliens are behind all of it.  To avoid detection, Jake must crawl past the cameras and shoot them from the ground. This is a major objective in the game, and also a major flaw - you can be detected even while crawling, which makes it almost impossible to get where you need to go without the game suddenly ending.  The majority of the game - searching for keys to open doors, shooting monsters - is decent enough, although nothing new. The only real differential here is the perspective (third-person rather than first) which sometimes works to your disadvantage. Jumping on the alien spiders, which you can't shoot, is extremely difficult given the perspective and the camera's insistence on staying behind your head, no matter where you look.  While the graphics are passable, they in no way blow the lid off the PlayStation's processors. If you're dying for an action title with a little alien in it, check out Broken Helix. Otherwise wait for Tomb Raider 2. That at least will have a cute chick in it.", "date": "May 30, 1997"}
