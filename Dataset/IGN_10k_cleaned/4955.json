It's a franchise that excels in absolutely nothing and yet, somehow, someway, it's very popular. We're totally baffled by its success. So comes Cruis'n World, first to the arcades (courtesy of Midway) as an update to the original with very little extra to offer, and now to Nintendo 64 (courtesy of Nintendo). You can't imagine how thrilled we are.  Developer Eurocom, best known for its amazing Nintendo 64 port of Mortal Kombat 4 and upcoming Duke Nukem: Zero Hour, is once again in top form. Cruis'n World not only looks and plays better than its arcade predecessor, but it actually features new additions including never-before-seen tracks and vehicles. Unfortunately, in the end, all enhancements considered, the game still fails to escape the one thing that keeps it from becoming a classic: itself. Cruis'n World started out a bad racer and, sadly, will always be just that.  Gameplay So here's how it works: Cruis'n World features 14 new tracks and 12 new vehicles. Locations, based all around the world, include Egypt, Moscow, Germany, New York, France, Mexico, Italy, China, Hawaii, Africa, Japan, Australia, England and Florida. Vehicles, which can be boosted for faster speed and painted different colors, range from vintage muscle cars, roadsters, sports cars, pick-up trucks and a ~unique three-wheel delivery truck~ among others. Following tradition, the game boasts a handful of hidden tracks and options like the ability to race on the Moon.  What we like about Cruis'n World is this: it doesn't take itself so seriously. It doesn't try to be the Gran Turismo of Nintendo 64 or the end-all stunt-racer. Rather, it takes a significantly less serious approach to the genre. Instead of realistic physics, vehicles power-boost, fly through the air, flip, turn on two wheels and swerve on a dime. In a nice twist, players can also earn points by pulling off stunts. Reach a certain number and you will receive hidden goodies, like cars, better engines, or paint jobs.  Instead of true-to-life racing environments, courses are filled with absurdities including flying saucers and bouncing kangaroos at every corner. It's exactly what you'd expect of an arcade-racing game and, in that respect it is somewhat refreshing -- with great emphasis on ~somewhat.~ Unfortunately, it doesn't really offer anything else that other racers aren't currently doing much, much better. Tracks are decidedly boring and easy, but that's nothing compared to the game's other limitations. Alternate paths are few and the main road doesn't enable players the privilege of veering off to explore. This despite the fact that backgrounds practically beg to be driven to. Honestly, if it's high-flying, unrealistic, arcade-like racing you seek, why not give San Francisco Rush, or better yet, Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA a try? Both games offer much more depth and ability than the entire Cruis'n series combined and multiplied.   Multiplayer On a brighter side, the game's multiplayer mode runs just fine. Two, three or four players can race it out around the world and have quite a bit of fun. That said, the game's easy level of difficulty wears thin quickly even when playing with friends. We found ourselves honking the horns of our cars in nearly every race, not because it's funny, but because we were bored.  Graphics Visually, this game isn't anything to write home about, unless, of course, your friends are wowed by enormous amounts of pop-up and draw-in. Actually, we're being a bit harsh. Graphics are, for the most part, crisp and clean; Framerates are constantly smooth, which helps to create a greater sense of speed; Vehicles are well-designed and pretty. All in all, the only thing killing this game in the graphics department is its aging engine, which, as we've said, has always had draw-in problems to the extreme. Also, as you might have guessed, the Nintendo 64 version is mysteriously deprived of any violent roadkill graphics. Go figure, huh?  Sound Cruis'n World also features a variety of music samples that fit each level to a tee. The sound is crisp and clean, with decent engine noises and lots of arcade sound effects. The music isn't bad, either. It's virtually identical to the arcade (streamed off the cart in mono, of course) and includes plenty of voice samples. It should be noted, however, that the tunes are a bit on the 80s side. Thankfully, Eurocom included a feature that enables you to change the music on the fly, just like in the arcade. So if the Cruis'n Shuffle annoys you, switch to the jungle beats by pressing C-Left. This is an undeniably great port of an undeniably bad game. Gameplay is smooth, quick and decidedly boring. Graphics are crisp, clean and filled with pop-up. The game's engine and gameplay style -- fun for a few minutes when it first came out in the arcades -- is what ultimately does it in. Don't encourage more games of this type. The Rush franchise is more deserved of your hard-earned cash.", "date": "Oct 9, 1998"}
