With 3 different mini-games masquerading as a whole game, Die Hard Trilogy 2 could have had one standout section. And I could have actually used my past couple of days to do something productive. But no, none of these things happened. Bruce will remain untouched, I will never get those days back, and this game has absolutely NOTHING to offer.   It's a classic case of spreading the programming muscle too thin. Instead of focusing development time on making one of the 3 ~games~ interesting, the development team was apparently more interested pairing off with the marketing team to create pithy taglines like ~Viva Las Vegas~. In fact, the intro video, which has zero to do with the actual game actually shows signs of more work than the game itself.   Assuming you'll actually care about the plotline after I'm done ripping this game a new one, I'll paint a small picture of what to expect from this shining gem of shite. Friend to all nature, whupper of much ass, and all around uber-pimp John McClane has decided to attend a ~congrats, you're a warden of a new Vegas jail~ party for a friend. Of course, if DHT2 involved you running around, popping random annoying partygoers, then later getting tanked and hitting on every consecutive female at the party until you eventually ~got some~ from an equally fit-shased hottie, this game would kick ass like Doug Perry after a 40 and some Pez. But no, the inevitable occurs: a jailbreak. And surprise of surprises, McClane gets to do what he does best. Sure, it's lame, but it doesn't hold the game up either. Wait, that should have been a positive comment to counter negative one. Ah well.   Gameplay Developer N-Space have had a spotty record at best. Better games (Duke Nukem: A Time To Kill) are overshadowed by ho-hum (Rugrats, Tigershark) and utter poop (Bug Riders) entries. With a history like that, it's a toss up as to how Die Hard Trilogy could have (see, there's another one) turned out. Well, now you know.    The second ~Trilogy~ pretty much follows the exact same style as the first down to a T, which really begs the question, ~Why?~ Why would Fox Interactive turn over the coding chores to someone else to redo what they've already started (and executed quite well in the case of the previous DHT)? The mind boggles. Anyway, as the trilogy implies, 3 games (if you can call them that) are rolled into one. Die Hard Trilogy tries to be a first-person shooter on rails, a driving game, and a third-person shooter, and accomplishes none of those things.    Much like the first game, any sort of redeeming value will come from the first and most enjoyable element, the third-person shooter. Problem is, the third person action is rife with bugs. Case in point, clipping and camera work. So, can't see behind that wall, eh? Well, no problem, since you can use McClane's apparently unrealized psychic gifts to see around walls. Simply walk up to it, and then turn 90 degrees. Presto! The camera slides through the wall to reveal the contents on the other side. This option can be turned off, but that just leads to annoying camera problems. Camera problems and odd pop-throughs aside, McClane is gifted with a good assortment of weapons with which to dispense his ~shoot first, shoot later~ approach to law enforcement.   Likewise, the other gameplay elements are just as spotty. The Virtua Cop-esque sequences love to play 'Find the Framerate' dipping into the teens and then surging up to the 30+ region, dragging you along all the way, so you can scream ~Whee! So this is what motion sickness feels like!~ And you can pretty much forget about trying to get past the levels without the benefit of a light gun (we recommend the Namco GunCon for all your ass-capping needs).   The driving sequences offer a good framerate, but shoddy control. The whole objective is to stop prisoners from escaping, while ramming random other unnamed cars into oblivion. Like I said before, if the same span of time had been spent on one of these sequences, I have no doubt that they would have been good, possibly even fun.   So what plusses does Die Hard Trilogy 2 have, if any? Well, support for one. With all these different game styles, you'd better be able to accommodate fans of each genre, and DHT2 offers it up in spades. The list reads like a peripheral fanboy's wet dream: the PlayStation mouse, racing wheels, light guns, and the good ol' DualShock controller. I will have to admit, the support makes actually playing thorough these sequences MUCH more fun, especially since it's across the board support for the peripherals. Unfortunately, if you're driving through crap with a racing wheel, you're still driving through crap.   Graphics  DHT2 suffers from what I like to call ~3rd-generation syndrome.~ The PlayStation is now into it's 5th generation of titles, meaning many programmers have had many chances to get it right. New techniques for squeezing power out of a 5 year-old system are still being unlocked and applied, and games like R4, GT2, and Metal Gear Solid show it. However, a lot of companies got up to the third level (or licenced an out-of-date third generation engine) and decided that was enough evolution for their thin blood. There are so many games out there that still look like they're stuck in 3rd-Gen Land. Such is the case with this game.   Most of the problem comes from textures that just get too grainy and muddled up close. This isn't as apparent during the third-person and driving sequences, but it's all too apparent during the first-person shooter levels, and the framerate shows.   Other than bland textures, DHT2 actually does look nice, and the framerate stays solid in most cases. Explosions look good, complete with shiny, happy shockwaves, and the animations for McClane and most of the enemies are up to par (but nothing revolutionary).    Sound Sounds effects are average. There, I said it. You've got your gun shots, you're screams of anguish as you mow someone down, your Bruce Willis-sounding voice quips, your shatter glass, and your booming explosions, but they're not stellar, they're not even all that noticeable.   What is noticeable however is the music. Not because it's good, but because it's just annoying. PR lore has it that the very same man who composed the score for the rave flick Go, wrote the music for this game. I have seen Go and bought said soundtrack, and this, sir, is NO Go. It's washed-out techno with no real heart, and it's better left turned down or off. Likewise, the ~theme rap~ for the game is pulled off by underground rapper Lil' Zane, an artist that should probably stay underground.  I tried to enjoy Die Hard Trilogy 2, I really did, but there's really nothing to enjoy. It tries to be equal parts Rad Racer, Virtua Cop, and Syphon Filter, and fails at all three. I know it's tempting to pick up this game because of the tie-in to the great action flicks, but the only action you'll find here is the amazing amount of times you yawn while in mid-gunfight or car chase.", "date": "Mar 3, 2000"}
