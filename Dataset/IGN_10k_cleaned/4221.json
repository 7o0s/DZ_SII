But that's not enough to float their first  and hopefully last  PlayStation endeavor: Spice World.  More of a ~fan trap~ than a game, the overall idea is to take a member of the group (Geri is still amongst their ranks) from mixing room to video shoot. While this may sound like fun from a conceptual standpoint, especially for fans, it proves slow, uninspired, and unrewarding in execution.  Gameplay is divided up into several stages. You first re-mix a song, then learn some dance moves, teach them to the rest of the girls, and finally record a video. It's a tedious process that relies more on rote memorization than gameplaying skills, and ultimately proves the same no matter which girl you select.  Fans of the game will likely enjoy the Spice Network clips (video interviews and outtakes), and the initial oddity of controlling their favorite pop figures may be appealing, but the game itself should be considered a definite rent-only for even the most hardcore Spice Girls followers.
