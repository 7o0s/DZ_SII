It tells the tale of 10 strangers brought to an island for a dinner party only to discover that they've been lured there under more mysterious motives by a character only known as U. N. Owen. Each of the characters is accused of murder (direct or indirect) by their host, and when people start dying, the real fun begins as characters begin scrambling for answers. One by one, characters are picked off to coincide with the child's rhyme ~Ten Little Sailor Boys,~ also known as ~Ten Little Indians~ which I can only assume has been changed for PC (politically correct, not personal computer) reasons, and players will have to join in the soire, solving puzzles and watching the mystery unfold along the way. Developer AWE Games have done a decent job creating an interesting adventure set around the happenings of Shipwreck Island though it's far from perfect.   The main issue with this game is in the presentation of what is a fantastic written story. The original attempt at remaking the movie had similar challenges as the story in its entirety isn't exactly Hollywood friendly given it's macabre conclusion. Instead, they wrapped it up with a smaller happier bow and blew the entire allure of the criminal mind behind the whole thing. This game does a bit of the same thing, even going so far as to fool with the murderer so that people who have read the book or watched any of the movie versions will still have some suspense about them. While I don't want to get into much detail, the ending is unfortunate, convoluted, and provides no believable motivation for killing these ten individuals. I should mention that there are actually four separate endings depending on a few decisions made towards the end, all with basically the same outcome as the murderer is always the same. Thankfully after beating the game, players have the opportunity to solve one last puzzle to see the original book ending to the story, which as I mentioned early     The challenges up against the developers in creating a suspenseful and unique game based off of a well-loved piece of fiction were considerable. In that respect, I have to commend them on their effort. They did a pretty decent job here even with the ending throwing the package off. The confines are fairly rigid in a project like this. Certain people have to die in a certain order and there are only a certain number of characters. The book only saw 10 people on the island during the course of events. But having players take the part of one of the 10 would simply throw everything for a loop. The only answer was the bring in an 11th outside character that was attached and disconnected to the story all at the same time. So they concocted the sad turn of events for boatman Patrick Narracott (Fred was the one from the book, this is his brother for plot reasons) to get stuck on the island and get involved in uncovering the murderer. It's a pretty clever way to add in a player character actually. He's always on the outside of the group for various reasons even though he's stuck right in the middle of the mess.   Unfortunately, the way the story unfolds precludes any real detective work, which is what I was really hoping for in this game. While there are some side-quest detective bits, they were mostly for entertainment value then finding any real clues. The story will simply play itself out as Narracott explores the island and fumbles his way around as an amateur sleuth. There are various moments where Narracott questions each of the different suspects, but this is mainly for advancing the story points and not for any real chance of solving the mystery before it happens.   So Narracott is always a step behind, but even with the inevitability of murder happening during the story, he manages to uncover some mystery and solve some various puzzles in order to try and escape the island. Most of it is manufactured either well or poorly. For instance, a goat blocking a path doesn't seem like it would really provide a horrible obstacle in real life. I figure I'd probably walk around it instead running back and forth to find a solution to the problem. On a happy note, some of the puzzles really are enjoyable and take at least a little bit of thinking to get through. There were even a couple that stumped me for a little bit before I realized the relationship between a couple of items or between something I had read before and . Unfortunately, on the other end of things, some puzzles can be a bit obtuse, especially when they involve some small object dropped in the world that blends in with the ground texture.   Visually, the game is decent enough to avoid gagging, but environments are largely static, character models are less than impressive (for their structure and animations) and any of these things put up next to better adventure titles would be lost in the shadow. The house itself is much better than the outdoor areas. Static environs in a house are pretty understandable, but when the wind is blowing and rain is falling, you expect a little more reaction from the foliage outside. The days of static backgrounds in adventure games should really come to an end. It doesn't help that there the resolution can't be adjusted either.   One thing I really appreciated with the game was the sound. While the effects were bland and music was actually pretty good, the voice acting was very good for most of the characters. Wargrave and Ms. Brent in particular were pretty awesome. They fit the story and were just over-acted enough to put a smile on your face.Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None is a decent adaptation of a good book to video game format. There are certainly some choices made with the design that I find uninspired, but for the most part, gamers that enjoys the Agatha Christie mystery will enjoy taking part in event. Just remember, it's basically an adventure game, not a mystery where players can actually discover the bad guy and win the game. It's about being part of the story as it unfolds and solving some decent puzzles along the way.", "date": "Dec 14, 2005"}
