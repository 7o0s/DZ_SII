The game's mix of ingredients - pop culture, classic videogame references, off-the-wall humour, hip hop styling and tongue-in-cheek nods to movies - is potent enough to make anyone dizzy. But is the result like downing a shot of absinthe - it seems like a great idea at first, but the headache that follows means there's no chance you'll come back for more?   The simple answer yes - and no. We're happy to report that Hot Pixel's mix of ingredients works relatively well, thanks to its tried-and-tested mini-game format. Like Wario Ware before it, players must tackle a series of challenges, each lasting no more than a few seconds. These super-fast tests of skill are as varied as they are brief, so one moment you're blasting tomato sauce bottles from outer space and the next you're a radioactive monster gobbling toxic waste.   The really crazy mini-games are the best in Hot Pixel.  As such, if you like mini-game games then you'll likely dig Hot Pixel. However, while this style of game is by no means new, we do expect at least a smattering of originality. Hot Pixel, however, does a lot of the stuff already in Nintendo's Wario Ware games. For starters, both are structured in the same way, with players tasked with completing groups of between 10 and 20 mini-games before tackling a boss challenge. Similarly too, players gets three lives and if they lose all of them it's back to the beginning of that group. Sound familiar?   To play, Hot Pixel couldn't be easier. Each mini-game is a simple matter of pressing a switch, collecting an object or other such straightforward task, by pressing the d-pad or tapping a button, usually X. It's incredibly intuitive, which is definitely a good thing, so the challenge comes from working out what to press within the strict time limit rather than struggling with controls.    There are lots of references to modern culture in the game.  As for variety, there's certainly a wide range of challenges to keep you entertained. These range from skating over gaps to flapping the wings of a bird to avoid a hunter and removing pimples from a model's face, plus many more. In fact there are 200 mini-games, so you never quite know what's coming next, despite being are grouped together in general themes.    Of all of the mini-games the ones that stand out the most are those that use the game's neat 'partixel' engine. These are simple block-based challenges that crop up throughout the main game, with objects controlled by the player acting like magnets so they either attract or repel other objects on screen. For example, in one game you're tasked with dashing around the clingy pink pixels while trying to avoid the blue dots. They're a lot of fun and the blocky, retro-style graphics really add to the enjoyment, and even if you've played Wario Ware they're still a breath of fresh air.   If you're a junk food addict then Hot Pixel is right up your street.  Another welcome addition is the smart playlist, which enables players to group different mini-games together. You can therefore get in some much-needed practice on those you struggle with or simply have a quick blast on those you like, without getting stuck into the main game. The playlists can also be set to dynamically react to your skills, so if you're doing well the difficulty is increased - great if you're looking for a little extra challenge or you just want to check out some of the mini-games you might have missed.   Last in the line up is Xtra Games, which are challenges that boast a bit more substance compared to the main game and can played without time limits, which is great if you just want a casual blast. Indeed, these Xtra Games provide some of the highlights in Hot Pixel, such as challenges inspired by Tempest and a memory game in which you've got to repeat different light sequences. They're great fun and we guarantee you'll spend the most time here, racking up high scores.   Hot Pixel has certainly got its own unique style.  But despite the addition of the playlists, partixels and the Xtra Games there's no escaping the fact that it does very little different from Wario Ware, which was first released four years ago. Back then Nintendo's mental mini-game collection set the bar for the genre and the format has been improved ever since, with new features added and control methods improved. In that respect Hot Pixel is a huge step backwards, because the controls are overly simplistic and lack the ingenuity of those in, say, Wario Ware Twisted. So while Hot Pixel is enjoyable enough, it feels like a like a game that that's four years old rather than something that's trailblazing the genre.If imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery then Nintendos yellow-capped rascal is surely red with embarrassment. Hot Pixel doesnt really build on the foundations Wario Ware set four years ago, instead simply tacking on pop culture references in an attempt to appeal to the skateboard massive. Admittedly theres no denying that at times Hot Pixel is fun and that its collection of mini-games is varied and interesting. However, the genre has been done better before, and many times too. If youve only got a PSP then its worth a look. But if you really want a mini-game to get your blood pumping check out Wario Ware: Twisted on Game Boy Advance.", "date": "Jun 15, 2007"}
