What the game lacks in history and originality, it makes up for in a deep combo-laden fighting system, exquisite graphics, and layers of gameplay modes that few games offer.  Bloody Roar II brings gamers back to the human/animal fighting scene with seven new characters, four returning ones, and a next-generation look and feel that's difficult to beat. While Bloody Roar II and its predecessor build on existing fighting systems (it's difficult not to these days), and are created by a developer better known for Bomberman than for its brawlers (Hudson), this new version offers the beginner and expert fighting game player a deep, rewarding experience with a twist.  After the evil Tylon Corporation was defeated in Bloody Roar, the genetically altered character/creatures (created by it) known as Zoanthropes formed an independent rogue group to regain dignity for their ~kind.~ (Sounds a little like the X-Men, actually...) As they become more prominent, average humans learn to fear and despise these enhanced creatures, and small wars break out across the globe. The Zoanthropes organize, forming the Lebanese, whoops, the Zoanthrope Liberation Front (ZLF), which is secretly a terrorist group with no tolerance for humans, dissident Zoanthropes, or anyone else, really. Now it's up to you (whomever you choose to be) to rid the world of the ~other guys.~  Gameplay Most folks will go straight to the traditional Arcade mode and just get it on. Here, players will find 10 computer controlled opponents to battle, and at the end of the final one, a new move will appear as a reward. A live opponent can join in at any time for a live tete-a-tete. Those of you (and I hope most) who like to brawl against live opponents, will find that the Vs mode serves the ultimate in real fighting.   But it's the added modes, such as Story, Survival, Watch, and Custom that add loving replay value to the once simple Bloody Roar format. The Story mode unravels the origin of each transforming creature-human and brings each into contact with the other as rivals or allies. And of course, players will fight all 10 of them. Survival is not a new idea, but it's still enjoyable and challenging. Players will take on every single other fighter with one health bar! Yes folks, training is a smart idea prior to entering Survival mode. The Watch mode is self-explanatory: Players pick two characters to fight and they sit down and watch them. Wooo-hooo! It's actually cool because new moves are shown, and opponent weaknesses become more obvious.   Custom Mode is probably the most unique of the four.  Prior to gameplay, players can customize their characters, with choices from Big Headed characters (Superdeformed), Afterimages (a flashing trail of body images), Kids (super small Superdeformed), Big Arms (just what it sounds like), and Normal. Other choices are Wall Display, Sidestep, and Exit (Heh! Just kidding!). If anything, this mode makes the game just plain fun to tweak and goof around with.  Fighting System After Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and Virtua Fighter, fighting systems just haven't evolved. They may have been more refined, or tweaked to new degrees, but let's face it, those are the building blocks for all other fighting systems. Bloody Roar's system is a hybrid of them all, and in some areas, it's easy, in others it's complicated. Each character has his or her own move set, and they also share the basic building blocks of hit, punch, shove, block, jump, etc. What's exceptional about Bloody Roar's Fighting system is its side-stepping function (available in the first game), players' ability to juggle their characters relentlessly, and the Beast moves.   Obviously, the sidestepping function enables full 3D play. When an opponent rolls out his or her combo, just step out of the way, and then drive yours down his throat, or rather, into his back. It's as easy as pressing a shoulder button. For me, this brings the game into the modern world, adding that extra little function to deepen gameplay.   The amount of juggling in Bloody Roar II has increased drastically. It was there before, but the developers pushed the limit this time around. Take Bakuryu the Mole and use his swing hit, followed by a Smoke Spiral Kick, and you're getting four- to five-hit combos. That's just for starters. Use the Watch mode to learn intense air juggles.  Last but not least is the Beast mode (which used to be called the Rage mode), enabled by the Circle button, which transforms players into their chosen animal, monster, or insect. Creatures have increased power, different moves, and a death-defying set of special moves. To highlight a special move that finishes off a character, the walls of your environment will break loose to enhance the effect, a nice touch brought back from last year's version.  It's tough to enter into the fighting market these days, as can be seen by so many failures on the Nintendo 64. Bloody Roar II has brought a good game home, with all of the added extras to heighten and broaden the overall value of the game. Overall, this game is great fun to play, and is solidly set in the top tier of fighters on this system.  Graphics  First off, gamers will notice the high-resolution graphics that sharpen and crystallize the polygonal, textured-mapped characters. This truly delivers Bloody Roar II into the top tier of best-looking PlayStation games. While the characters themselves are rather ordinary (except the new gal Jenny the bat, who's decked out in red miniskirt and shows off long legs), it's the animals people really want. The creatures are all bizarre, lean toward a Japanese sensibility, and are exquisitely designed, both in their tight programming, and in the level of texture details, shape, and movement. Especially cool in this version is Busuzima, the chameleon, and Stun the Insect. From last year's batch my favorite is still Bakuryu the mole. Weird but cool.  In several of the modes, players get the chance to choose the background, too. They're all nice looking, but I enjoyed the beach and aquarium levels the most. In the latter, little schools of fish swim around, to show off the programmers' ability to keep high frame rates, high resolution and awesome characters all going at the same time. Unfortunately in Arcade and Story mode, players can't choose their backgrounds.   The level of motion-capture is good, and players generally look like realistic humans (when they're in that form). Even if they don't seem perfect, they are consistent and quick. The response time is better than before, although nothing really beats Tekken in the 3D arena.   One of the biggest rip-offs in the game is a technique from Sega's Fighting Vipers. The quick, three-perspective finisher and the breaking walls are straight from Sega's second-tier fighter that never grabbed the crown like the Virtua Fighter series did. It's still cool, and has its place, but it's worth mentioning.  A few extras to take note of are the return of excellent uses of lighting and the game's particle engine. Constant flashes of blue sparkling light appear when characters build up their Beast meters, and crackles of color are everywhere, in special moves, blocks, spins, transformations, juggles and combos. As I was saying, this truly is one of the best-looking PlayStation games available. Sound I'll make this short and sweet. The sound effects are good, as good if not better than last year's game. But the music is like a series of generic riffs extracted straight from the bad heavy metal of the dour mid-'80s. Don't get me wrong, I like my fair share of Ratt (OK, I really don't), but this music is truly uninspired. Barf me out!In the waning years of the PlayStation the last fighters to appear on the system have been excellent. It's as if the good ones are only getting better and better. That's definitely true for Bloody Roar II, a great looking game that is deep in gameplay and in its satisfying fighting system. If I could have brought back the characters from last year and added these new ones, the game would have been better, and even deeper. Eleven starting characters is good, but more is always better, right?Another cool note is the slick looking manual. It's got a subtle cover, but the reverse white text on back background, and nice choice of fonts and details create a look and feel that are consistent with the game.I usually just like to play, but for some reason the Watch mode is just plain cool. I really like it. The Story Mode is not quite what I expected, and frankly, it's not quite as deep as a comic book storyline. It's still cool, but not great. Anyway, it's the overall package that attracts me to Bloody Roar II.", "date": "Jun 4, 1999"}
