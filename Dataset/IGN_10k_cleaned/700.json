Finally, Dark Arms: Beast Busters 1999 has come to lay some sod in the NGPC's bountiful rose garden. And what sod it is. While there are numerous innovations in this top-down shooter, the overall experience is dry and unimpressive.FeaturesMultiple weapons that can be upgraded, transformed, and even fed.Combination action / adventure / RPG gameplay.Changing night and day featuresFour levels, all with night and day variations.Multiplayer Deathmatch using your individual collected weapons.As you can see from the features list, this game has a lot going for it. As a top-down action / adventure game with RPG elements, the game is a clever hybrid of genres that are fun to play. Only remotely based on the old SNK arcade game Beast Busters, Dark Arms plays like a Pokmon player's Ikari Warriors. Weapons are grown out of eggs, nurtured when you feed them enemies, and evolve into bizarre crossbreed tools / weapons. This gives the game strategy, as in battle Beast Busters must switch to the net gun when an enemy is weak to collect them if they want to feed their weapon -- too many shots to an enemy and they will die before you collect them.There are other innovations as well. There are dozens of weapon variations (the gun, for instance, has a shotgun, machine gun, and laser variation), so collecting eggs throughout the game will give you new opportunities for special weapons. And once you will up your arsenal with all kinds of strange killing devices, hook up the link cable and take on a buddy with your special creations.Yet as soon as you see the game's half-hearted text translations, that slow sinking feeling will set in, and it will never leave until the game is out of your NeoGeo Pocket. The control isn't horrid -- in fact, when you back against a wall, your character will turn around and strafe along the wall -- but the game still stands out as only average despite the innovations, and is never much fun to play. Blame much of that on poor game design and story for failing to build excitement. The levels, despite the night / day shifts and towns to explore, are tiny little environments with few puzzles to solve and boring creatures to fight. Your enemies are simple in the long-despised 8-bit tradition, and the only challenge comes in building your guns so you can kill things faster. The graphics are colorful, and the day / night transition adds to the visual appeal, but the game is just about unplayable on the standard NeoGeo Pocket. And the storyline, a screwy translation of an even screwier Japanese plot involving a grand master named Raison, a manifestation of death which eventually transmogrifies into a kindly little girl, and an army of Beast Busters (of which your are the only one), does nothing to hook players into the so-so gameplay.With all the games on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, this title measures ankle-high in a field of giants. Not that this game couldn't have held its own against Sonic or Metal Slug if the gameplay had been incredible as the ideas were, but the wonky storyline makes this adventure duller than dirt.", "date": "Feb 10, 2000"}
