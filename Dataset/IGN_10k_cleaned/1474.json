{"name": "WWF No Mercy", "name_review": "WWF No Mercy", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/11/14/wwf-no-mercy", "text": "THQ has certainly got a stranglehold on the videogame wrestling genre, as was proven with last year's WWF Wrestlemania 2000, the best and most popular wrestler to be had on any console. Packed full of WWF superstars and overflowing with trademark moves, the game set the mark that other, competing titles would try to erase -- and with no success.   Now the company has once again teamed up with Japanese developer AKI/Asmik to deliver the most comprehensive wrestling game ever in WWF No Mercy, but is it really all that much better than its predecessor? And more importantly, if you already own WWF Wrestlemania 2000, is No Mercy worth the price of admission? Below is Blake Norton's review:  The Facts    No Mercy is the follow-up to the monstrously successful (and bloody good) Wrestlemania 2000.  There's in the neighborhood of 65 characters, not including hidden characters such as Shawn   Michaels, Jerry Lawler, and some rumored WWF legends.  The one-player storyline mode features seven different titles to fight for with developing   plots depending on what matches you win or lose and what characters you appease as you play on. Compatible with the Game Boy Color via the Transfer Pak.   The cage match remains, and features like the ladder match and guest referee from Smackdown   have been added.   There are a total of seven different areas for hardcore matches - the main arena, the top of   the stage, the backstage hall, the parking lot, the bar, the booking room and the boiler room.  There's a smack load of new weapons, and new ways to use them.   There is a commentary table at ringside which you can put your opponent through it in an   almost infinite manner of bone-crunching ways. Create a Pay-Per-View Event, complete with name, date, arena, number of matches and the   content of each match.   The arenas have an updated look, and the Smackdown arena has been added.   Each pay per view arena has a unique ramp entranceway to brawl on, such as Wrestlemania's   giant TV screens you can smack your opponents' heads off.   This game is going to sell by the truckload.   Gameplay   It seems like an eternity we've been waiting for this one. Wrestlemania 2000 was to many   wrestling and gaming fans alike the definitive wrestling bible.   No Mercy is as straight a sequel as you'll ever see. The main game engine is practically   untouched; any gamer familiar with Wrestlemania 2000 or other games using the control system   will be immediately at home here. It must be said off the bat that     The first thing to say is that nothing has deteriorated - and WM 2000 was so good that that's a   sigh of relief. However, there are definitely some questionables here. First of all, the speed   and mechanics work exactly the same as Wrestlemania, which worked exactly the same as Revenge   before it, now a few years old. While I find the controls easy to use, I was hoping for some new   features, some new types of moves and interaction with the environments around the wrestlers. By   and large, it's no dice. There's no brawling in the crowd or anything close to it, which has to   be only a matter of time at this point. You can't leap up on the ringside barrier for moves like   Jeff Hardy's plancha spear to the concrete. Basically, it's Wrestlemania 2000 all over again.   A far more disturbing problem is the game's speed. When three or more wrestlers are involved, the   speed diminished rapidly. Royal Rumbles often play in slow motion, and tag team ladder matches   are absolute murder. Since those features are a big part of this game, there should have been far   more foresight involved in deciding how much drain to put on the N64's now aging processor.   Whether it was to cut the crowd animation and diminish the frame rate, the game engine really   ought to have addressed this problem in the years it has been developing into what is now No   Mercy. Instead, it seems to have gotten worse.   The last major gripe about this one is that the computer's AI seemingly hasn't increased one   iota. When in storyline mode, you'll win one match in two minutes, so the computer cranks it up   for the next match. The result is that every move you try is blocked and countered, every Irish   whip, every bodyslam, every everything. Despite your best technical skill, when you get the   computer even just a little cheesed off you'll soon be using the old Wrestlemania tactic of   luring them to ringside, smacking them with a weapon and doing it all over again. A more subtle   difficulty curve and more sensibly paced back-and-forth action would definitely have been   appreciated.   The most striking screw-up with the computer's intelligence comes in tag team / handicap and   ladder matches. If you're involved in a triple threat match, a tag match, a handicap match or any   other style bout where you go for the cover and a third character in the ring would be well   served to break it up, they usually don't. I can't count how many handicap matches I should have   lost pitifully but after eight minutes of running like a madman and tossing around sledgehammers   and hit the 3D and a quick pin, then thanked my victim's tag team partner for just standing there   above me and not breaking it up. And the ladder match is something else. I have not once - not   once - seen either my partner or either my opponents try to climb the ladder. NEVER. The net   result is that whether it takes you two minutes or two hours to haul ass up the ladder and grab   the briefcase to win the match, your chances of losing are remote at best. Since the ladder match   is a major part of this game's allure, this just shouldn't be.   It's not all doom and gloom, however - those points are more picky ones from an N64-er who played   Wrestlemania to death, and don't dominate the game's enjoyment. The control system, while aging,   remains extremely usable and fun. While the game publishers claim that countering your opponents   moves is all down to timing, you'll most likely just end up bashing the ~block~ and ~evade~   buttons like a madman, but such is the case for all wrestling games.   The environment, while still restrictive on some levels, benefits greatly from the addition of   backstage brawling and a commentary table at ringside. All the ~little things~ are there in this   regard; you can leap on or off the table, leap at your opponent from it, toss them on to it, drag   a guy off it and more. There are few things more satisfying than delivering a stiff powerbomb   through the broadcast table and going straight for the cover. Things get really crazy in the   ladder match. You can attack people via the ladder in a variety of ways, hitting them with it,   hitting it with them and so forth. Climb up to the top of the ladder and you can either go for   gold or launch an airborne attack. One of my all-time favorites is a breathtaking Frogsplash I   executed with Eddy Guerrero, where he dive-bombed from the top of the twelve foot ladder, all the   way over the top rope to the floor, landing squarely on Viscera like a giant pancake.   Over on the backstage brawling front, all rooms are accessed easily, and without the annoying   loading time for each new location that Playstation users have to endure for Smackdown. The   environments are realistic, atmospheric and stacked with appropriate weapons. You can pick up a   fire extinguisher and smack your opponent head-first into the heating system in the boiler room.   The booking room has a table set up for a meeting with chairs around it - naturally, you can   smack your opponent with the chair, then stunner them through the table. The graphics in the bar   are absolutely stunning, with simple yet vibrant neon effects and a flat-out well-designed   background. Go ahead and play some pool, smack your opponent with the cue and then put them   through the billiards table. Finally there's the parking lot, which is always littered with   weapons. You can toss your opponent into the back of a WWF truck and smack them back and forth   between the iron walls just for kicks.   On this thread are the weapons. There's a whole new cast of barbaric utensils of death, such as   the ~Stop~ sign, Hunter's sledgehammer, bits of broken tables, the fire extinguisher, the   ringbell, and naturally, the steel steps at ringside. It's not the number of weapons that counts,   but how you can use them that's really fun. There's the standard weak swipe and strong swipe,   which will usually take your opponent off his feet, yes. You can smack 'em as they stand, smack   'em as they sit and smack 'em as they lie on the ground, bleeding and unconscious. But that's not   all, folks! An improvement over WM 2000, the weapons no longer have a habit of flying out of your   hands or disappearing at a moment's notice just because you want to kick a guy who's pinning your   partner, or use the ropes for some extra speed with which to deliver your potentially lethal   blow. Have you ever slammed your opponent on a weapon in a wrestling game and said ~ooh, a slam   on the chair!,~ even though you knew it did no more damage than a regular slam? This time around   there's the ear-pleasing crunch of twisted steel and jagged broken tables for all to hear in just   such scenarios.   The most pleasing weapons-related development of all is that you can now throw weapons. Not only   is it useful for smacking two opponents at once in a handicap match, but you can use this feature   to do such resourceful things as break up a pin attempt on your partner when you're stuck on the   outside. There's nothing more satisfying than being stuck on the outside, on the verge of losing   a ladder match, and hurling the ring steps over the top rope at the last split second, jarring   the ladder and sending your unwitting foe splatting to the canvas. Such refined attention to   detail is the bread and butter of No Mercy's advancements over Wrestlemania 2000, and they   definitely make a big difference to the realism and enjoyment of the game.   The cage match makes a return in this game, but has to be classified as a big disappointment.   With Smackdown 2's interactive Hell In A Cell, where you can fight all over the cage, knock   people off it, do moves on top and rip off the doors as weapons, No Mercy's regular cage match is   showing its age badly. There's really no offense you can mount from the cage, not even from the   top of it, which has been a feature of wrestling games for several years now. There's really no   excuse for it not being more interactive. It's a simple matter of tying your opponent up in the   corner and sprinting for the top of the cage - there's basically no other way to win, and most   victories, even against the toughest opponents, will be earned in the first 30 seconds or not at   all. This was very disappointing.   To move to a lighter note, we have new features in Guest Referee and the Ladder Match. The Guest   Referee is fun because you can beat them senseless. If you're controlling the guest ref yourself,   you can give your buddy a fast count over another buddy, or choose not to count at all. It's a   fun novelty, although multi-player Guest Ref matches end - without fail - with one of the players   turning off the N64 in frustration as the ref is too busy beating them up to count a pinfall.   The ladder match really shines. Despite aforementioned problems with the computer AI in ladder   matches, playing with a buddy is nothing short of mayhem. The ladder can be used as a weapon, a   launching pad or a device to slam your opponent on. Just like the real thing, you can launch   attacks from it anywhere in the ring or at ringside. Just as much fun is returning to the ring   with a missile dropkick off the top, clipping the ladder and sending your opponent crashing to   the mat with a satisfying crunch. The only drawback to this mode is that the ladder is so big, it   just invites added slowdown to a game which already suffers from it to an uncomfortable degree.    Lastabilty  A standout feature of Wrestlemania 2000 was the one-player mode, which featured the ~Road To   Wrestlemania~ challenge where your character would have to go through a year of matches in the   hopes of main eventing Wrestlemania. This system has only been improved upon here in No Mercy.   The idea of having wrestling storylines has been pumped into overdrive. While in Wrestlemania   2000 there were a few swerves here and there, some challenges to set up matches and whatnot, this   engine takes it to a whole new level. Once you choose what belt you're going for - there's seven   different championships in all, each with their own base cast of characters and swerves - the   story begins, usually with a contender's match. Then a Shane McMahon, per say, will come in and   make you an offer to do his dirty work in exchange for a title shot - depending on whether you   decide to help him or not, the storyline will progress differently. You'll find yourself doing a   run in to save his scrawny ass in a match, or take out an enemy of his in the parking lot. Maybe   if you chose not to help Shane, he lobbies a vendetta against you - a cut scene will show his   goons punking out your partner in the bar, so then you enter the bar and we have an instant   handicap hardcore brawl. The possibilities are vast, and being able to choose your own fate makes   this challenge mode a whole lot more interactive than those in games gone by. I think it was a   mistake not to throw that match with Dean Malenko at Vince McMahon's request - I found myself   having to win a handicap match in three minutes or be fired, which is just what happened! This   mode will definitely keep even the most anti-social hermits coming back for weeks and weeks, to   try each belt, try each twist, try each new plot development, then do it again with different   wrestlers.   The other singles mode is ~Survival.~ It's a nice addition, where you run the gauntlet of a   hundred wrestlers, in an effort to outlast them all. You get a score for eliminating guys via   pinfall or submission, as tossing them over the top rope (which qualifies as an elimination) is   seen as the cheap way out. At the end of the day, it's just a Royal Rumble with a hundred guys a   few a few tack-ons (the other three guys in the ring don't focus on your any more than each   other, as it is in a standard Rumble), but it's fun. If you want to win, particularly with a   decent score, set aside a few hours, and get ready to scream at the TV when after three hours   you're pinned with six men to go.   The wealth of options in two-player, three-player and four-player mode will ensure that this game   is a long-term party investment. It's when two or more players are involved that this game comes   into its element, as you brawl all over the arena and jockey to inflict table shots and score   blood. I'm a little disappointed at the absence of a two-player co-operative challenge mode,   which one would have hoped would be in this one, but it doesn't detract too severely from what is   a great multi-player title. Just remember that you have to deal with some slowdown.    Graphics   The first thing you'll notice in No Mercy is the swanky graphics. The entire mood of the game has   been changed from an afternoon in the sun to a darker, ever so slightly more hardcore feel, with   lovely atmospheric shades of blue and black dominating the landscape. The backstage areas are   rendered in the same scrolling 3D as ringside, and look wonderful. The parking lot reeks with   atmosphere to the point where you expect Rikishi to screech around the corner and run down Steve   Austin at any moment, and the Bar room is full of groovy jukeboxes and neon beer signs, not to   mention a pool table you can slam your opponent though.   One of the complaints about WM2K was that the wrestlers, despite the fluid animation, looked like   cardboard men when you got any way up close. While some of the faces are still a bit suspect in the new version (Triple-H inexplicably looks like the haggard old woman you picture as being   behind the plot for the Blair Witch Project), the animation, costumes and textures are much   smoother. The Dudley Boyz are a tremendous example, looking, moving, acting oh-so realistic (they   actually look more cartoon-like on TV than they do in this game on occasion). The blood effect   has also been significantly upgraded. While you might not even notice it at first, the realism has   been upped to the point where guys legitimately look hurt. Of course, there's no way you can say   that these animated characters look more realistic than their digitized counterparts, but it's a   wise tradeoff. Unlike in Warzone and Smackdown, No Mercy gamers get smoother animation and none   of that weird-ass stretching effect or clunky looking slams in No Mercy. Going down   wrestler-by-wrestler, you'll find that there's a lot of attention to detail. Kane indeed towers   over little Crash Holly (and looks damn scary, too), Rikishi's ass is larger than a small planet   and every single little body gesture and taunt is down pat. Shane McMahon's ~Where Did He Go?~   dance will have you believing that you're watching the TV show, and Scotty 2 Hotty's ~Worm~ even   looks good. The wrestlers interact smoothly with the ring and all their surroundings and props.   The ring ropes bounce realistically, whether you're simply bouncing off for an elbow drop, being   tossed to the floor in the Royal Rumble or watching Taka Michinoku execute his gob-smacking   no-hands springboard plancha to the concrete.   On the negative side of things, the Titantron is still horrendously blocky. Each wrestler's   entrance video is shown with his introduction, summed up in four incredibly pixilated, blurry,   full-screen video shots. Why the programmers didn't just have these shots play at one   quarter the size on the Tron in the background while the boys make their entrance is beyond me,   as the quality is so low it's flat-out embarrassing, and takes away from what is otherwise a   visual feast.  Also  noteworthy, the non-skinned character clipping and low-polygon look of the wrestlers found in 2K is, because the same engine is being used, once again present in No Mercy. I can overlook it because there is so much else the game has to offer visually, but one would hope for more in this fourth-generation attempt from THQ and developer AKI/Asmik.   Sound Like Wrestlemania 2000, No Mercy crams in theme music from every wrestler in the game. No Mercy   improves on the quality of the music a great deal, and though it's still suspect in places, it   won't detract from the principle of what it's there to do. There's some funky tunes for the   selection screens, and bearable in-game music too. The sound effects of the weapons, while not   always entirely accurate, are full-bodied and satisfying. There's few things sweeter than   smacking your opponents square in the face with the ring bell.   Overall, the sound in WM2k won't set the world on fire, but there's nothing embarrassing here   either, and the effects - where it really counts in a wrestling game - are suitably barbaric and   crunchy. Note: All sound effects and music are mono, so don't expect Dolby Surround from this one!No Mercy is a terrific game from top to bottom. The game mechanics are sound, the animation is fantastic, the characters are very responsive and there's a tremendous amount of game modes. If you're a wrestling fan, or even just a fan of fighting-style games, this should definitely be on your list. My only reservation is that if you already have Wrestlemania 2k, which is very, very similar to this, try before you buy. Unless you're a hardcore wrestling fan, or desperately need the ladder match, you might be best off renting it a few times and saving your smackers for the next wrestling game that comes along.", "date": "Nov 14, 2000"}
