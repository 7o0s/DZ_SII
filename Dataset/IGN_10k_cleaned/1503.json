The game is an interesting but frustrating blend of different short- and long-term objectives, where your final goal is your decision.  Will you annihilate enemy civilizations in combat?  Will you forge a lasting world peace?  Will you be the first civilization to build great wonders of the world like the Gaia Controller, the culmination of all human arts and sciences?  This open-endedness and lack of focus is Call to Power II's strength and weakness.    With utter freedom, you send out your first settler to find a suitable place to lay the foundations of your capital city.  From there, you create new settlers and military units with which to explore, build new cities, and deal with other empires.  As your network of cities expands, you're presented with the task of managing three basic resources: food, production (the capacity to build and manufacture), and commerce (monetary wealth).  Tied into the rise and fall of these resources is the contentment and efficiency of your populace.  You'll need to take ~bread and circuses~ very seriously if you want to avoid a nasty revolt.  This means you'll have to balance the wages, workday length, and rations of your populace.  A longer workday, for instance, yields more production, but happiness declines.  Balancing variables like these forms a central element of gameplay.  One of the most useful features of Call to Power II is the option to let mayors handle the micromanagement of each city according to what you'd like to emphasize, like military expansion, growth, or production.  This feature simplifies all the variable weighing you have to do, and it functions well, but at the same time it removes much of the core gameplay from your hands if you choose to employ it.  The mayors don't take your overall strategic situation into account either, focusing instead on each city's individual needs.  You'll often need to override or turn this feature off to grow your empire effectively.  Still, there is more of an empire-wide perspective than in previous Civ titles. Despite the limitations of the mayor AI, it's nice to take a break and focus on particular aspects of your strategy without being bogged down with making sure every city has a marketplace. You can also add a building to each and every city's production queue with a single click now. Remember how tedious it was to go back to each of your cities and rebuild your barracks one by one? Well once a new technology gives you access to new buildings, you can opt to add the new building to a large number of cities at once.  More often than not, gameplay is a very leisurely affair.  As you slowly and methodically explore, build, and manage in the early stages of the game, there's almost no sense of tension or emotional engagement.  You can literally play for an hour without any drama or conflict as you march your exploring units about the map hoping to stumble across another empire.  It's true that the resource and building management provides some intellectual involvement, but you don't often feel as if you're fighting the clock or combating the imminent chaos of imbalance or poor planning.  Any intellectual involvement is itself limited early on: as long as you keep some basic principles of balance in mind, you'll often feel as if you're just tinkering instead of carefully and wisely creating a civilization from scratch.  The fairly weak AI running the other empires also makes things a bit too easy.  Happily, there's Internet multiplayer supporting up to four players for more of a challenge.  Diplomacy is one of the more interesting aspects of the game, letting you adopt a wide range of stances and tones.  You can make or break alliances, demand a city or gold in tribute, offer a new technology, forge pollution reduction treaties, and so on.  An added bonus to the diplomacy model is the chance to form counter proposals. In other words, if the English come knocking asking for the secret of your latest military technology, you can make that revelation conditional on the English withdraw from your territories. Or if they want to get a look at your world map, you can ask them to compensate you with cash. Commerce is similarly sophisticated, letting you set up trade routes or send out bandits to loot foreign caravans.  It's refreshing to see so much emphasis placed on diplomacy and trade alongside the existing emphasis on internal commerce, military development and scientific progress.  Combat is a little too abstract, with no room for tactical maneuvering. Once your units meet the enemy's, it's virtually out of your hands. This puts the emphasis on your larger strategies (which unit types to build, where to position them, etc) rather than focussing on your own skills as a captain. After all, Roosevelt didn't actually lead the landing at Normandy, right? (Oh man, does that ever give me an idea for a movie). The combat animations are a little tedious and, given that you can't really interact with the battle, a little pointless as well. It's fun watching your units fight against your most hated enemies, but only the first eighty dozen times. After that, it can get a little repetitive. Thankfully, the developers must have had an inkling of how mind numbing these sequences would become, because you can toggle them off. On the bright side, you do get some interesting units that can attack in far more vicious and clever ways than pitched battles, such as the cyber ninja who can plant a nuclear explosive in an enemy city.  The isometric view makes scanning the tile-based landscape and oversized units quick and easy.  Terrain graphics are crisp and readily distinguished.  Units are decently drawn and colorful, though moving them with the very twitchy mouse controls can be intensely frustrating.  Still, the overall graphic style of the game world and units is bland, and animations are minimal and dull, even in combat.  Sound effects and voice responses from your units are equally lifeless.  On the other hand, you'll see stylish little CGI movies with vibrant music when you create a wonder of the world.  Also, the complex menu/window system is colorful and consistent, doing a fine job of presenting the huge amount of options and displays at your disposal.  For a game that aims for epic scope, Call to Power II ultimately misses its target.  Yes, your empire expands and evolves over thousands of years, and the research tree is staggeringly large.  Still, it feels as if the game takes on too much at once and does it too abstractly. While it's certainly an improvement over the previous title, it still doesn't expand the original Civ model. We don't expect them to reinvent the genre necessarily, but it would've have been nice to see some meaningful additions to the game. There are some new additions in terms of management and functionality but apart from that, there are very few new ideas in Call to Power II. The hands-off auto-management feature is a nice little ~addition~ (although it seemed to have been present in some form since the second Civilization) but it works about as well as the rest of the auto-build mayors in other games. In other words, not much.  Nevertheless, if you've got the patience, it's very satisfying to watch your empire grow and prosper over the centuries, and gradually to gain newer, more powerful units.  And even if combat is a little one-dimensional, it's still fun to conquer enemy cities.  In the end, though, Call to Power II simply lacks the focus and emotional engagement that would lift it out of mediocrity. Like I said, you can't expect every game to break new ground the way that Civilization originally did, but you'd hope that in the ten years since the original's been released, there'd be something new to do with it.   -- Scott Osborne      Want to share your opinions with the world?
