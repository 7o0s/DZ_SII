That last job not only gave me the chance to familiarize myself with the Italian-American concept of Hospitaliano, it also gave me some insights in to the world of restaurant management. And while those insights never catapulted me past the 12% barrier, they've served me well in reviewing Trevor Chan's latest game, Restaurant Empire.  In Restaurant Empire you play as Armand LeBoeuf, a young French chef who's just inherited his uncle's restaurant. As you learn to manage the various aspects of restaurant management, you'll gain reputation and earn money. Do well enough and even more restaurants will come under your control -- from the Roman bistro owned by a gangster to a music-themed club in Los Angeles. Along the way, you'll progress through a variety of story sequences that give you the opportunity to add new ingredients, recipes and staff to your empire.  You'll be in charge of nearly everything here -- from selecting dcor to choosing a menu to setting prices to hiring and managing your staff. You'll even have to select all the beverages served in your restaurant. The game even goes far enough to charge you for a liquor license if you want to sell booze. (Although the license is pricey, the profits from beer and wine are nothing to be sneezed at -- not if you don't want the health department breathing down your neck.)  The recipes are the coolest part of the game. Each restaurant has a unique menu and you can add any item that your chef knows how to make. To maximize profits, you'll want to stick with high-profit items that don't take too terribly long to prepare. But you'll also want to offer high-priced special dishes to increase the appeal of your restaurant. Restaurant Empire also allows you the chance to set up different kinds of restaurants, each offering different types and qualities of recipes.  The quality of a recipe is determined by your chef's skill in that particular national cuisine and the ingredients used in it. You can opt to use less than perfect ingredients to decrease the quality of your food. While it sounds counter-intuitive, you'll actually gain more influence and power by selling yourself short a bit. Offer food of a higher quality than people expect and you'll alienate your clientele. Eventually you can have multiple restaurants in the same city offering varying levels of the same kind of cuisine.  From time to time, diners will come in and offer you access to special recipes or special stores that sell high-quality versions of your ingredients. Provided they fit with the rest of the menu, these new dishes can really increase the appeal of your restaurant. The new ingredients can ramp up the quality of a given dish but as they also tend to increase your costs, you'll need to make sure that the increase in sales offsets the higher cost of production.  Restaurant Empire requires you to hire a full staff for each of your restaurants. You'll need a few chefs and a handful of servers, of course, but you'll need a few other workers to keep things running smoothly. A receptionist (we call 'em hosts), greet people and direct them to an open table. Captains (expeditors in my book) plate the food and get it ready for the tables while porters (bussers to you and me) collect and wash dirty dishes.  The staff interface allows for all sorts of tweaking. You can hire and fire people, grant them raises (to raise morale and courtesy) and even set a restaurant-wide training level. Spend enough cash and you'll see the various skills of your employees grow. You can also transfer your staff from one restaurant to another. It's not as important with all your staff; most can be recruited anywhere in the world. But your chefs are distinct enough and important enough that you might want to consider moving them where they'll be put to the best use.  While the comment card box at the Olive Garden was usually filled with prophylactics, Blo-Pop wrappers and Canadian coins, the patron feedback in Restaurant Empire is much more appropriate. You can check the individual complaints of each of your guests anytime you want. What's more useful is the compiled list of all complaints. It's one thing if one of your servers is rude to a patron; it's another thing entirely if he's rude to thirty people over the course of a month. You'll also see if your prices are set too high or if meals are arriving late.  On the fastest speed, patrons and staff blink about the screen quicker than you can follow. This speed is only used to forge ahead once you've got your settings in order. If you actually want to manipulate anything in the environment, you'll have to bump the speed down a level. The fastest speed that allows for interaction runs about one second of real time for every minute in the game. Discounting special events, you can run through a whole day of operation in about 15 minutes.  Your performance on that day is extrapolated in to your performance for the entire month. You can therefore run through a whole year of restaurant operation in a few hours. At the end of each day you'll see a balance sheet for each of your restaurants spelling out how much profit you've made. You'll also see your progress towards the mission's main and secondary goals.  Typically you're given a few months to achieve each goal. The early missions are quite straightforward and you'll likely get through the first four or five without much trouble. The first few tutorial missions are so easy, in fact, that you're pretty much assured success. Things start to get more difficult as the game progresses though and you'll strive very hard over many months to achieve that extra star or maximize your profits or service.      But there are a few things that really might have helped complete the experience. First, I'd like to have the option to schedule my employees' hours. Although you need a full staff of employees to take on the lunch and dinner rushes, it seems stupid to keep four servers on staff during the hours between three and six when there aren't any customers at all. Likewise, the ability to assign servers to specific sections of the restaurant is also missing. Naturally, some of these finer points are abstracted in the overall game model, but when I'm worrying about buying the highest quality basil so I can boost the rating on my duck comfit, I can't help but think there are other, more direct ways to increase profits. Likewise, being able to set a font for your menus but not being able to set a dress code (or even uniform) for your employees seems slightly inconsistent. But the absence of these features only stands out because Restaurant Empire simulates so much else.   Unlike most economic simulations, Restaurant Empire places a premium on story. Your uncle will return from time to time to point you in the direction of new challenges and opportunities. You'll begin to meet a whole cast of characters, from new chefs to store owners, who can help you build your empire. Taken by itself the story won't hold too much interest to people but as the backdrop of the game, it really helps provide a direction and purpose to your game.  From time to time you'll be called on to participate in the cooking arena, Restaurant Empire's version of Iron Chef. Three chefs will compete in a certain style of cuisine, sometimes even focusing on a specific dish. When you throw your hat in to the ring, you're basically relying on your chef's skill and his inventory of special ingredients to win the day for you. There are a few small mini games that you can play during the competition and your success in each will boost your chef's performance. The mini games are all entirely abstract and rely on timing or logic to complete. Success in these ~chef-offs~ nets you a higher reputation rating and increases the appeal of your chef's restaurant.  Camera controls are conceived quite well. Although some of the menus and pop-ups tend to obscure too much of the screen (particularly when you're placing objects), you can usually get exactly the right view for any given moment. Free rotation and a limited zoom and tilt let you investigate every corner of your restaurant. Hopefully you've decorated each restaurant in a specific and pleasing style. You'll have to place each object in your restaurant -- from bathroom sinks to wall lights to plants to tables to dumbwaiters.  While there's definitely a fair bit of charm in the atmosphere of the game, the visuals are the one part of the game that need the most attention. Next to games like The Sims or the upcoming Republic, Restaurant Empire's graphics seem a bit dated. I certainly appreciate the realism of having individual patrons come in, interact with the staff and eat a distinct meal. But the low-polygon models hardly sell the experience.  But despite the poor resolution of the graphics, there are plenty of visual details that bring the game to life. Although it doesn't sound terribly impressive on paper, the fact that you can see the individual dishes on your menu being put on your tables is a big treat. Of course the spreadsheets offer more accurate data on what's being served, you can gauge the popularity of certain dishes by watching the tables. Small icons offer easy access to crucial information like patron satisfaction, total bill, and so forth. What did you think of Restaurant Empire?   Unfortunately, while the system requirements have been kept reasonably low and the game runs fairly well, the less than stellar graphics are bound to turn some people off. But the game represents a genre where graphics aren't as important as content and those who dismiss the title purely on the basis of its appearance are definitely missing out on one of the more original tycoon games currently available.Another day, another tycoon game. Although titles like Railroad Tycoon and Capitalism are real watersheds for the industry, they belong to an era that didn't offer as many copycat titles as the genre currently has. And while Restaurant Empire isn't terribly attractive on the surface, it offers a fresh approach to the economic simulation market. It's not stretching things too far to think of Restaurant Empire as the long-awaited but still unannounced workplace expansion for The Sims.But where The Sims is a social game, Restaurant Empire is a business game through and through. The story and chef competitions certainly add a few roleplaying and adventure elements, but this is a game about managing businesses, not lives. The graphics are mere window-dressing for the spreadsheets that drive the real excitement of the game. Fortunately there's enough going on visually to keep things from getting too dry and boring.The game could do with another layer of polish but the gameplay shines through despite the weaker presentation. You obsessive-compulsive types will find no end of sliders, toggles and checkboxes, each of which affects your restaurant in a significant cumulative way. Still, the game doesn't require you to get your hands on every single feature in order to succeed -- at least not during the first half. Stellar successes will only be achieved through careful consideration and adjustment of dozens of options.", "date": "May 28, 2003"}
