Even the most hardcore of hardcore shooter fans must be getting tired by now, as, if you wanted to, you could have already spent almost 10,000 Wii Points investing in different titles from this same genre. Dead Moon doesn't stand a chance. This altogether average and overall unnoteworthy release is doomed to be just one more title that gets lost in the shuffle, and it's nigh on ridiculous that it's debuting now, at a time that all but guarantees it'll be passed over and forgotten.        But here we go again. You're a pilot, again, defending the earth from an invading force of aliens, again. Dead Moon's take on the basic shooter plotline posits that mankind is under attack from a race of extraterrestrials who concealed their approach by hiding inside a comet. After crash-landing on the moon, the alien enemies mass their strike force on the lunar surface, and inhabit the hollow interior of the orbiting body as well. Dead Moon plays out over a course of six stages  starting on Earth, then crossing the void of space, and finally entering into the dark underside of the moon for the final confrontation.   Against a bunch of skeletons. For whatever reason, the enemies of Dead Moon are all, well, dead. Or undead. Or something. Rather than owning a physical design that makes them look like actual aliens, these baddies instead take the form of common earth creatures stripped of their skin. There's a skeletal fish. A skeletal bird. And the final boss is just a big human skeleton that throws skulls at you.     So no points awarded for creativity in enemy design, and no points achieved either in core aspects of gameplay  Dead Moon's progress and power-up system is just more of the same, and far too similar to other, better shooters already seen on the VC. You've got four colors of collectible upgrade to gather  blue gives your ship lasers, red is flying rings, green is straight-shooting waves of energy. Grabbing more of the same shade further powers up your arsenal, and just slightly innovative is the fact that colliding with an enemy or hostile projectile won't kill you straight out in one hit. Instead, your weaponry will take the blow, downgrading your gun instead of exploding your ship.   Also just slightly innovative is a rotation option, which allows you to turn your ship around to face to the left during boss battles. Players of other shooters recognize the impact of such a simple feature  in almost every other game of the genre, your ship is forever fixed and facing one single direction.  So Dead Moon is not without its own smattering of individual merits. And had Hudson and Nintendo held back and waited a while, giving shooter fans a chance to breathe and releasing this title later this year, it may have had more of a fighting chance. But its placement, in such close chronological proximity with such other, far superior shooting games, dooms it from Day 1. Don't bother with Dead Moon  it's been said before, and, unfortunately, will likely be said again  but there are far better options already available for finding your shoot-'em-up fix.", "date": "Jun 4, 2007"}
