In Whiplash, a weasel uses a rabbit as his weapon, grappling tool, and helicopter rolled into one. It's comedy at its most base level, getting a good giggle at the expense of a li'l bunny's pain, but hey, it works. Similar twisted humor runs throughout the rest of Whiplash and is the strongest reason for picking up what is an otherwise flawed platformer.   Taking cues from old Looney Tunes cartoons, Sam & Max, Kids from the Hall, and countless other sources, Whiplash creates a ridiculous world for a goofy pair of characters. As Spanx, a weasel, you are chained to Redmond, a rabbit, and your mission is to escape from the evil Genron corporation. Slated to be fused into one weasel-rabbit thing, Spanx and Redmond break free from the genetic combinator and are on a mission to take Genron down on their way out. What follows is a madcap quest that starts off in a flurry of action and slows down to a crawl when big design problems start tearing the game apart.   Gameplay  The Genron corporation is an evil corporation whose main goal is to abuse as many animals as possible in the name of science and beauty products. After escaping the genetic combinator, Spanx is given a mission from a mysterious voice via the electric wires that are still stuck in his brain from a previous experiment. Their goal is to cause as much damage as possible to Genron equipment and save all the cuddly, and not-so-cuddly, critters along the way.   The first hour or so of Whiplash is one of the funniest bits of gaming I've played since Sam & Max Hit the Road. Running through the facility, Spanx and Redmond come across all sorts of bizarre experiments. Chimps with afros are given extreme haircuts, more chimps are forced to listen to extremely loud music, and in one room scientists are firing hamsters at a wall just to see how well they stick. Meanwhile, a cheery 50s television announcer voice makes announcements about Genron's product line and how the abuse of animals is great for your make-up.    Even Redmond gets into the act with the commentary. Spanx is a mute character and Redmond makes wisecracks about the action. My personal favorite is in the very beginning when, after jumping over some crates, Redmond says, ~yes, yes, jumping over boxes, I think we've all done this before.~ I cringed the first time he spoke because I think that a talking character is always bad news, but for a while his comments made me laugh out loud.   The rest of the game is filled with other bizarre industrial-strength animal testing contraptions that must be taken down. Chickens are fired from cannons, crocodiles are strapped down and force fed fast food, and a gigantic incinerator is home to a large goo beast. At certain points, the game even starts to make fun of itself. Entering a gigantic room filled with mountains of trash and acid pools the announcer says, ~Genron presents... ACID!~ and later, ~Warning. I can't stop saying 'acid.'~    Like the name Whiplash implies, the only weapon Spanx has is swinging Redmond around. Thanks to genetic engineering of some sort, Redmond has been made invincible and the perfect implement of destruction, sort of. The more damage Redmond causes, his meter increases until he reaches Hyper mode. At this point, he'll get jacked up, become spastic and inflict damage on anything the pair come close to.     Just swinging a rabbit around can sound a little simplistic, and it is, but there are a couple of other skills you pick up along the way. After knocking down any of the human employees of Genron, they can be further pummeled into the ground to get some HyperSnax to pop out of them. Get enough of them and both characters will level up. Spanx gets more hit points and Redmond becomes more powerful. Complete a level and new abilities are granted that can begin to create combos attacks that can juggle humans in the air or just have a powerful finishing swing. After quickly mastering what was available, I started to get bored with just a few different attacks and hoping for some more variety.   The enemies vary a little, but in attacking them it only takes one simple strategy to take them down. Humans can block an attack with their arms, but if they do it's just a matter of constantly hitting them until they put them down or pausing for a second until they start to attack and then hitting them again. After maxing out both Spanx and Redmond, I started just running around the humans, which is easy to do, and avoided the whole process altogether.   In addition to being a pummeling tool, Redmond has a couple other tricks that change the game around a bit. Electric orbs can be hooked onto in order to swing to a new spot and hanging wires can be grabbed and ridden like a zip line. There are also some power-up machines that will set Redmond on fire, fill him up with helium to lift both into the air, juice him up with electricity, making him toxic, or freeze him into a block of ice. A couple of times, these power-ups are useful in getting to a new location, especially with the helium, but mostly provide a temporary way to inflict a different kind of damage on the humans. Turning Redmond toxic makes him glow green and causes the humans to grow gigantic heads.   All of this destructiveness and human abuse is really icing on the cake for the larger game itself which is a clunky platformer. The entire game takes place in one connected complex. There are a few interlinked hubs that lead to the rest of the map and for the majority of the game it's fairly obvious what needs to be done and the gameplay progresses in a fairly linear fashion. Most of the objectives are to get through a dangerous area, like the acid room, through a series of jumps and slides. It's pretty standard stuff here, but it's after the main objectives are complete that big problems start to pop up.    There is no easy way to get around the Genron corporation. At key points a warp tube will be placed that will get the pair to the next location they need to go to. If you want to go elsewhere other than a room in the arm of the complex you're in, you're in for a big hike. Once in an area, the only way to get back to the main hubs is to backtrack the whole way or keep on going through to the end. Since some areas cut off any backtracking ability, one wrong turn into an area would force me too replay some twenty minutes of platforming action. I even tried turning off my PS2 and restarting, but a checkpoint save kept me back in the thick of things. My only choice to continue was to crawl all the way out again.      This crawling can take quite a while because there are a lot of hallways and tunnels in Whiplash. There are some stretches of hallway that seem to go on for a couple hundred feet. Since they keep getting replenished with robotic spiders and guards they require some fighting as well. I couldn't see any reason for them to be there other than they stretched out the game even further. After backtracking over and over, each hallway trek became all the more tedious.   Throw in a map system that is difficult to control and mission objectives that can get stuck describing some other area and finishing the game becomes a task of trial and error and repeating large chunks of the game. By this point, the humor had long since worn off and I was stuck in a clumsy game that makes it difficult to get anything done. Where Redmond was once a witty character, his comments, like the rest of the game, had been repeating for several hours and had grown old and stale.    Graphics  Whiplash is not the most elaborately graphic of games. The textures and graphics are nothing to write home about, but there are some good elements of humor in the design. The corporate executives are have a grinning Bob Dobbs type of face (imagine a typical 50s picture of a grinning guy with black hair slicked back). Odd devices are scattered about the levels and the effect describes a sick and twisted world that's still safely in the cartoony category.   One of the best features is the character design of Spanx and Redmond. Spanx is appropriately psychotic with his head whipping around during any pause in the action. While the attacks were as simple as tapping one button over and over it was still a bit of a kick to see a white rabbit flying all over the place.    Sound  Bouncy and cartoonish music fills the background while a small set of sound effects are in place for the fighting and the bashing. With swinging Redmond around as the only weapon, the sound of a swoosh and a whap are what I heard for hours on end. The Looney Tunes influence is in full force here as it feels like the sound designers went over their notes from watching old cartoons.   The voice acting is done well and causes some laughs, but more of them would have been appreciated. With a small set of enemies and a limited amount of quips from Redmond, there's not a whole lot of new things that I heard as the game went on. I kept hoping that Redmond would go beyond all the things I'd heard him say a few dozen times, but it didn't happen.It's sad to see a good joke grow bad just because you hear it over and over again, but Whiplash has that effect. If the action had been consistent and the ending not devolved into a clumsy Easter egg hunt this wouldn't have been as much of a problem. Coupling some jokes that get old and haggard with an assortment of repetitive running and jumping tasks makes for a disappointing experience.I felt let down because even after playing for the first couple hours, I was looking forward to see where the game was going to go and what new jokes would pop up. When the jokes ran out I was left with an awkward platformer that was difficult to figure out what to do next or how to get there. I'd recommend renting this game and bringing it back as soon as it gets old.", "date": "Nov 20, 2003"}
