An egg-shaped, bird-winged spaceship with a brain, Opa-Opa is the signature star and humble hero of Fantasy Zone, a classic Master System shooter from SEGA. We encourage you to introduce yourself now, because Opa-Opa is a character you're very likely to have never met before  especially if you were a young NES loyalist in the late '80s. He was only known to SMS players in those days, and today, in fact, is his first official arrival on Nintendo hardware. So say hello.   And welcome, too, his unique and original shooter design. Fantasy Zone is the second SEGA Master System title to come to the American Virtual Console, following last month's inaugural effort, Wonder Boy. This side-scrolling shooter is styled to seem sugary sweet, with vibrant pastel backgrounds, cartoon foes and over-the-top, ridiculous bosses who scowl at you with grimaces of gloom. But while there have certainly been other visually similar ~cute-'em-ups~ to come to Wii VC before, Fantasy Zone sets itself apart through a key aspect of its gameplay  its scrolling isn't forced.   Rather, like Midway's arcade classic Defender, you can choose to fly either left or right at any time, in any level. The screen will scroll in either direction, following Opa-Opa around, or you can choose to alternate back and forth between left and right, left and right. It's all up to you, as your ultimate goal is track down every stage's complement of enemy bases and destroy them. Doing that summons a boss to oppose you  then, after blowing him/her/it out of the sky, you move on to the next level of the Zone.   Fly your mighty fighting eggship to destroy the evil smiling spiky guys. Haha!  It's a dynamic design that is, thankfully, different. And different is prized on the Virtual Console these days, especially in the overflowing shooter category. Fantasy Zone doesn't just stop at Defender-style scrolling, base assassination and boss battles though. It's also all about the money.   Cash money falls from fallen foes in the form of collectible coins, which Opa-Opa can gather and save. Then, on occasion, a red ~Shop~ icon will appear on the screen which, if flown into, will trigger a pause in the action and the arrival of the mid-game power-up supermarket. You can spend your collected cash to buy upgrades to Opa-Opa's  offensive capabilities, making his basic laser and bombs more powerful. Or you can boost the size of his wings to make him fly faster. Or you can just invest in lots of extra lives  it's up to you, and there are any number of different successful strategies for how to appropriately purchase more power.   Be wary, though, that every time you buy something in the Fantasy Zone shop its price will increase. So while the first Heavy Bomb you buy will be relatively cheap, the laws of supply and demand will make the second, third, fourth and beyond much more expensive. Economics lessons for free  thanks SEGA.   If there's anything bad to be said about Fantasy Zone, it would likely be something about either its looks or length. Visually, as stated, it's got a cute and happy graphical package  but it's not quite as pretty here in the 8-bit Master System version as it was in its original arcade edition, or in its alternative 16-bit version that came to the TurboGrafx. On length, too, gamers could feel like there should be some more content for their investment  Opa-Opa's quest is concluded after he clears just seven fairly short levels and a boss rush at the end. These complaints are minor, though, in comparison to the appeal of the rest of what Fantasy Zone offers. It's really a great game and a great value at 500 Wii Points.Paying no mind to the unlicensed Tengen port of Fantasy Zone to the NES almost 20 years ago, the arrival of the SEGA Master System version of Fantasy Zone on the Wii's Virtual Console really is Opa-Opa's Big N debut. And it's an occasion to be celebrated. This is a mascot and a series that only a select group of fans got to enjoy in their original days, and they've always deserved more attention and a wider audience. We'd recommend you become a member of that new audience  especially if you've never met Opa-Opa before.(And, while you're still considering spending five of your digital dollars on a download here, take the time to read two of our other recent features featuring Fantasy Zone. IGN Retro's Levi Buchanan recently dedicated a full installment of Fond Memories to the game, and it also took a spot in the Top 10 Classic Shoot 'Em Ups list compiled there less than two weeks ago.
