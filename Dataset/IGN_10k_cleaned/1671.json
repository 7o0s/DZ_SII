These people fervently believe that any PC game bold enough to feature actual military combat jets somehow bears a moral obligation to imbue them with flight dynamics and characteristics that are authentic down to the millimeter. They forget that 98% of the US public has never set foot on a military base, much less logged any time behind the stick of a modern day supersonic fighter. For most of us the closest we're likely to get is watching the History Channel or memories of CNN's Gulf War footage, of coalition jets shoving 2000-pound bombs up the tailpipes of the Iraqi military. We simply value the visceral thrill of flying into a heavily defended military complex and lighting up the battlefield with missiles and guns, we just don't want to have to quit our day jobs to learn how to do it.    Mission Studios knows this well and is back with the fourth iteration in their longtime series of air combat games, which date back to the early, early days of PC gaming. Jet Fighter IV: Fortress America emphasizes action and excitement over by-the-book realism in a storyline plucked right out of Hollywood. This time out the fighters presented within are the F/A-18 Hornet, F-14 Tomcat and F-22 Lightning, three very diverse and disparate platforms. However, none are modeled with any degree of accuracy and their flight models are extremely relaxed. Consequently, anyone with a desire to fly can easily jump in and be off the ground without so much as cracking the manual.   Fortress America sets up a classic 1980's era conflict: The Russians have teamed up with the Chinese and the North Koreans to invade the Western Coast of the United States while the rest of the world is chooses to watch from the sidelines. Thanks a bunch mates, we'll just go it alone this time shall we? The lengthy pre-game intro is told through scrolling text and makes about as much sense as an episode of the A-Team. Take the second mission for example: we are told that the Russians have deployed an orbital weapon that emits a giant space cloud which has destroyed all the world's satellites and devastated lines of communication. Space Cloud? Additionally, the North Koreans have launched a massive attack against land-based communications using the Internet. Exactly how in the hell did they accomplish that?  Previous iterations of Jet Fighter saw conflict in diverse hotspots around the world, however, this time out the campaign is set solely in Northern California; though the battle terrain encompasses all points between San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Reno and Yosemite National Park. Should you reside in this part of the country you will easily recognize the landscape, as it is depicted using actual US Government satellite imagery. It is actually pretty cool to fly around local landmarks like the Golden Gate and Bay bridges, and then blow them up; which should prove pretty cathartic for the thousands of hapless bastards that slowly commute across them each day.  In addition to the single campaign there are 32 individual missions, a handful of free flight and training scenarios as well as four multiplayer missions. Which sounds like a lot until you realize that the campaign is nothing more than the individual missions played one after the other. A quick mission generator is also offered, but the interface for this is very clumsy and is far too rigid to be enjoyable.  The game play is a mixed bag, which ultimately falls short of meeting Mission Studios claims of ~putting the fun back into flight sims!~ Prior to each mission a briefing is read describing the situation, goals and military objectives. A map of the combat zone accompanies each briefing, but does not show waypoints, targets or danger zones, so it is all but worthless. Each mission must be completed 100% before moving onto the next one. They are also brutally difficult, which is odd considering the casual market that this product is aimed at. Missiles and Anti-aircraft guns are very thick in every scenario and since you don't have prior knowledge regarding their placement there is no way to plan your route, short of trial and error. At least the cheats are readily accessible. Fortunately, there is a lot of variety to the missions, including lots of aerial, land and naval engagements.  Jet Fighter IV is guilty of a number of other mistakes too. The information conveyed through the heads-up-display is generally too vague to be useful. Striking the ~T~ key cycles air or ground targets, depending on the weapon currently selected, yet makes no distinction whether or not the missile or bombs have any chance of succeeding. More often than not air-to-ground weapons will impact on the side of a mountain or fizzle out well before reaching their target. Including an on-screen hit percentage or blinking message reading ~Shoot Now~ would help a great deal. Audio is also sorely lacking. We were expecting your wingmen to broadcast all kinds of information regarding the threats in the sky and on the ground. But most of the radio traffic comes across almost as a whisper, even with the volume turned up high. Additionally, your fighter doesn't convey much in the way of alerts or warnings. Most of the time you will have to spot incoming missiles and gunfire visually before popping a flare and diving for the hard deck. Bomb explosions are also weak. Even the engines sound like a Dustbuster held under water.   The manual does a reasonable job of explaining how to employ the various types of weapons and even goes so far as to suggest successful tips and practices. While a wealth of detail is expressed regarding aerodynamics, maneuvering and landing no reference is provided on any of the three fighters themselves. After extended play I am still unable to really discern one from the other and I am left feeling like they are merely a foil to move the game along. Fighters Anthology, released a couple years ago, was kind of like this but at least there were over a hundred fighters available within. Enemy aircraft AI is unremarkable, but this may be a factor of how strong your ability to target at extreme distances is, as you can identify foes at ranges exceeding 70 miles. If patient, it is trivial to get behind an enemy fighter and blow them out of the sky. Finally, guns are worthless in the air, ground or sea.  The base install of JF4 is a hefty 600 Megs. However, the quality of the terrain texturing is dark and muddy. Installing the Hi-Res Scenery CD (optional) improves things somewhat, but the footprint increases to a whopping 1.5 Gigs. Regardless, the 3D engine is rather sloppy, gaping seams appear frequently and clipping is a pronounced problem. However, the fighter models are nicely done, sporting dynamically lit surfaces and displaying real-time weapon loads. Overall, the performance is very solid and smooth at full detail on a recommended system, even at higher resolutions (available up to 1680 x 1260). A 3D accelerator card is required and we did not experience a single crash using the patched version.  Multiplayer is provided via LAN or the Internet, supporting basic matchmaking and providing only head-to-head deathmatch. No cooperative play is available. There is no online scorekeeping either, damaging the possibility of a community forming to support this game.   It is unfortunate Jet Fighter IV in its current state. A couple of more months of rigorous testing and polishing would have made a world of difference. Better mission planning; pumping up the audio feedback; and more differentiation between the fighters could have also helped increase the accessibility. Casual players are better off with a more forgiving experience like the recent Crimson Skies or even last year's USAF. Nonetheless, Jet Fighter IV is not a bad game, it is certainly provides strong visuals and has a unique setting for its campaign. But as it stands now the extreme difficulty will probably prove too much for the average gamer.  -- David Kozlowski", "date": "Dec 20, 2000"}
