The gameplay was on the simpler side, but working with a friend to capture monsters in bubbles and send them popping (along with some great examples of Engrish: ~Let's make a journey to the cave of monsters!~) proved to be a charming experience.  Apparently, the people at Codemasters hate this game, as they've gone a long way towards destroying what made Bubble Bobble enjoyable in the first place.   Bubble Bobble Evolution features two characters named Bub and Bob who blow bubbles -- but that's about where the similarities to Bubble Bobble end.  Instead of dinosaurs, the friends have been replaced with boys in dinosaur costumes.  And instead of depicting the duo's ~journey to a cave of monsters,~ Evolution is set in 18th century London.  Bub and Bob are outside playing when they find themselves suddenly transformed from normal little boys into little boys wearing dinosaur costumes.  They are then separated and dropped into two towers where a mysterious voice tells them to enjoy the entertainment.  From there the two will have to work their way up to the top of the towers and confront their captor.   The levels of Bubble Bobble Evolution rotate as you move from room to room. Gone is the simplistic goal of the original Bubble Bobble: capture all the enemies in bubbles, pop them all, and proceed to the next screen.  Evolution clumsily switches the focus to flipping switches and transporting items from room to room.  Each floor of the tower is divided into three sections, and you'll have to solve little puzzles in each of the sections in order to open the elevator and advance to the next floor.  As you move between rooms, the floor rotates in 3D which, admittedly, is a nice visual effect.  But unlocking the elevator usually requires mundane tasks like flipping a switch in one room, proceeding to the next to find an item, then transporting the item in a bubble to the third room.  There are three types of switches (metal, stone, and wood), and they all perform different functions.  But telling the metal and stone switches apart is next to impossible and the game doesn't always notify you what the switch has altered in the environment.  So you'll often find yourself flipping a switch, then wandering around aimlessly wondering what it was you just did and what you need to do next.  On top of the often vague level objectives, the game also drops you into rooms that are blacked out and require you to search around in the dark for the light switch (all the while enemies are attacking and, probably, killing you).   This is not the Bubble Bobble you remember. Control is a simple matter of jumping (X button) and blowing bubbles (square button), with special bubbles you will rarely used mapped to the triangle and circle buttons.  You can switch between your two characters with a tap of the L button, or all of these controls can be customized in the options menu.  As Bub and Bob are in separate towers, you'll need to navigate them both to the top of their respective prisons.  But where this could have provided for some inventive play mechanics requiring players to switch back and forth between the towers and play the two characters off of each other, one boy's progress is actually unrelated to the other.   After every few floors you'll encounter a boss which is impressive in size but only has one canned animation it repeats over and over.  And defeating them rarely requires more than standing in place and blowing a stream of bubbles.  Other enemies scattered around the game are returning characters from previous Bobbles, like Zenchan the robot and Baneboh the ghost.  When defeated, they'll drop items that contribute to your score (which does nothing) or power-ups that increase things like your speed and bubble distance.  The power-ups are cumulative, which is nice, so you at least feel like your skills are improving as you make your way up the tower.    As with so many PSP games, load times for Bubble Bobble Evolution are atrocious.  Nothing will make you yearn for the instant gratification of the original game more than waiting a minute for your game to load, finding the game saved right before you entered an elevator, then waiting another minute for the next floor to load.  On top of that, the game's built-in tips take time to load.  So in the early stages, you'll flip a switch and the game will freeze for a few seconds -- finally, your tip will pop up, but then you'll have to wait a few seconds to get back into the game.   But here's where Codemasters really dropped the ball: Bubble Bobble Evolution does not feature any coop multiplayer.  What was probably the strongest selling point of the original game has been ignored in this update.  A competitive multiplayer mode for up to four players is included, but it is a shallow elimination game where you simply shoot ~bubble bombs~ at your opponents.    The music in the game is reminiscent of a carnival with a fun house version of the classic Bubble Bobble theme included.  Each tune should have been a few phrases longer, though, as you'll find they quickly begin to sound repetitious and, ultimately, annoying.  The graphics utilize 3D objects on a 2D plane, and the game starts out looking promising with bright colors and lively environments.  As you progress up the towers, though, you'll make your way through darker areas that, while they add variety, don't really suit the lighthearted Bubble Bobble world.Ultimately, Bubble Bobble Evolution is a matter of trying to fix something that wasn't broken.  This update could have capitalized on fans of the first game who spent countless hours popping bubbles with their friends on the NES.  When you die in Evolution, the game over screen shows the tower master with his back to you saying, ~You are not my son~  But you'll probably reply, ~You are not my Bubble Bobble~", "date": "Feb 26, 2007"}
