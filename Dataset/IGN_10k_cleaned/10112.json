While the Nintendo Entertainment System was still flogging arcade ports that marginally approached their source material, the Genesis simply made eyes bleed. The explosive colors, massive sprites, and smooth-ish animation in the Genesis arcade ports made the system an easy sell soon after its 1989 release.   The Genesis version of the Capcom arcade hit Strider was practically revelation in contrast with the sunset of the 8-bit generation. Hero Strider Hiryu, standing a few inches tall, lashed out against giant robo-gorillas and performed mid-air flips in a futuristic Soviet Russia. The game looked like a zillion bucks (and didn't cost much less than that thanks to the eight megabits of memory on the cartridge) and was one of the first games you slammed into your Genny to convince NES-owning friends that they were playing with mere toys. The NES did have its own Strider, but it wasn't close to an arcade port - it was a completely original game with very loose ties to the Capcom coin-op. And it didn't look anything like the Genesis game.   The other striking thing about Strider is just how short it is. The game is only five stages long and pads its length by leading the player into some tough action sequences that rely on pattern memorization and twitch skills. With some solid practice, I'd wager a skilled Genny jockey could power through Strider in a breezy thirty minutes. This wasn't terribly troublesome in 1990 because we had a different set of longevity expectations.   Strider stands tall.   Strider chronicles the exploits of Hiryu's action-filled quest to defeat the Grand Master and his dark minions in a not-so far flung future. Kiryu is armed not with a gun, but a sword that can be extended via a power-up. If Hiryu find a little droid, it shadows him and shooter out laser rings at enemies of the horizon. Hiryu's other talents are acrobatic. He can get a head of steam up when running downhill, execute amazing mid-air flips, and cling to both walls and undercarriages with a small sickle. Using all of these moves artfully is the best way to get through Strider's stages. Hanging from a ceiling while a bad guy walks overhead, only to jump up and slash its back is not an uncommon maneuver.   Once you get the hang of Strider, it's a rewarding game. Pulling off some tough moves, such as jumping at the correct point while running down a slope is very cool. Hiryu flings himself into the air as enemies helplessly wait for him to touchdown and start slashing. Slowing a descent by clinging to walls is another cool thing that may seem like old hat now, but was ultra-cool viewed through the prism of yesteryear. The low-gravity core is another standout moment. Hiryu goes into orbit around the core, striking it with his sword until it blows.   Now, Strider is hardly a perfect arcade port. The game is plagued with some annoying extra flicker and slowdown, but considering what was being pumped on-screen, forgiveness was an easy currency to spend. Looking at the game now, it's still remarkably unproblematic to dismiss these visual shortcomings. It's still an attractive game, and until the pixel-perfect port of Strider that accompanied Strider 2 on the PSone in 2000, this was really all we had if we wanted to play the game. (Capcom has since released Strider on game collections, so you can hunt it down there, too.)  Strider's Achilles Heel is its length. After seven or eight play sessions, you get the rhythm down and can breeze through it in under an hour. However, the game can now be picked up on the Genesis for a fraction of its original hefty price tag. That makes it well-worth seeking, especially if you want not only a fun Genesis title, but a sterling example of the eye-popping 16-bit visuals that sent Sega's machine skyrocketing.", "date": "Feb 29, 2008"}
