The year nineteen hundred and ninety-nine will certainly go down in the books as the breakthrough one for online RPGs, turn-based strategy games, and of course, racing titles in all shapes and forms. And we're not just talking about traditional driving sims either (such as Official F1 Racing, Rally Championship, NASCAR 3, etc.) but rather, more non-traditional racing titles with the likes of Driver, Midtown Madness, Re-Volt, Interstate '82, Star Wars Episode I Racer, Harley-Davidson: Race Across America, and LEGO Racing, to name a few.   That said, Accolade's Test Drive: Off-Road series is back again (now under the Infogrames moniker) and it too leans more towards the arcade-like racing games than aiming to deliver a hardcore simulation. The result is a mixed bag; a fun fantasy off-roading diversion but ultimately, in the end, it fails to really make a lasting impression.  Test Drive Off-Road 3 features 27 fully-licensed sport utility vehicles to race in, including the exclusive worldwide license for the trendy HUMMER, by AM General. Naturally, each of the vehicles (from manufacturers like Jeep, Nissan and Ford) offer slightly different attributes  such as variances in top speed, handling, acceleration, suspension and pure power.  But oddly enough, your car will take absolutely no damage whatsoever (even after falling 100 feet off a cliff). Furthermore, the SUVs feel light as a feather as it's possible to fly over jumps well into the air as if they were BMX bikes. Hence the arcade angle ...  Each of the vehicles can be somewhat customized by choosing three or four different-colored skins, and if races are won in the tournament mode, the player can exchange credits to purchase new engine, tire and suspension modifications, plus a few special upgrades, as well, including roll cages, power brakes and lift/lowering kits.   In total, there are eleven off-road fantasy tracks to choose from, ranging from densely-forested courses in national parks to urban no-rules racing in New York to climbing up and down mountains in the Canadian Rockies and Japan's Mt. Fuji. The colorful tracks are quite varied and for the first hour or two gamers will likely emit a few ~oohs~ and ~ahhhs.~ But the novelty of these lush, outdoor environments wear thin after a few races, even with the few branching options and shortcuts offered during the race.   Speaking of the game's graphics, the courses and vehicles are quite impressive for the most part, though the resolution is curiously unchangeable and there's still some clipping, distant objects that pop into view, and other visual oddities from time to time. Moreover, the sprite-based trees and shrubs look paper-thin, which takes away from the overall immersion factor.   Another shortcoming in Test Drive: Off-Road 3 is the lack of gameplay options. Despite the claim for ~extensive variety of racing modes~ as promised on the game's official Web site, there's only two modes in total: a single-race Arcade mode and World Tour, a three-division championship series. As touched on above, the more races won (or placed) in the World Tour mode, the more greenback to exchange for new vehicles and upgrades, along with new courses to unlock for the Arcade mode. Surely the folks at Infogrames could've thought of more game modes to add more life to this game. Um, like how about even multiplayer (especially since the A.I. for the opponent's trucks are lackluster at best).   The sound effects are about what you'd expect from a racing game, but the music stands out considerably, especially if you're into new rock/alternative music. Signed artists such as Blink 182, Eve 6, Incubus and Diesel Boy all contribute solid rockin' tracks that add to the atmosphere. Of course, all of this can be muted if so desired.   Test Drive Off-Road 3 isn't a bad game, but considering the proliferation (and variety) of racing games for the PC released over the past twelve months, it's certainly not one of the best. If off-roading some of today's most expensive SUVs sounds appealing to you, and driving them in locations you'll likely never get to experience in real life, this may be the title you're looking for.  -- Marc Saltzman", "date": "Dec 21, 1999"}
