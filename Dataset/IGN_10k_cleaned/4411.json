Ever since Epyx popularized the genre with Summer Games and Winter Games back in the days of the ~classic~ gaming systems, other developers have attempted their own take on the idea, usually releasing them around the time of the Olympics. The next Winter Olympics won't be around for another couple of years, but it is the winter time, and Telegames has released its own collection of cool games on the Game Boy Advance.  There isn't a whole lot to Ultimate Winter Games; it's a rather slimmed down, no-frills, four-pack of snow-and-ice challenges. But what's been done for this package is at least well produced and fun to play...it's just not going to win any awards for game design. Features Four different events Password save Multiplayer on one system Single cartridge multiplayer curling via link cable  Ultimate Winter Games is a package designed and developed by Sproing, a European studio that's most known for its large library of downloadable PC games. The team might be a bit excessive when it claims that its Ultimate Winter Games is, and I quote, ~the most realistic winter games simulation ever released for a portable video game system!~ There have been at least two other winter games pacakges on the Game Boy Advance, and, yes, this one is the best one created for the system. But don't believe for a second that it's anything close to a ~simulation.~  What the game is, is a collection of four different Winter Sports challenges done in a more arcade style.  Downhill Skiing is the straightforward title of the bunch. The idea is to simply get down the hill in the shortest amount of time, weaving to the prime ~groove~ of the track for the best speed down the slope. Snowboarding is the combination of skiing's time-based racing with a very, very rudimentary air-based trick system to score a required amount of points. For bobsled, it's a speedy trip down an icy gutter, with players trying to stay both upright and within the optimal position down the channel. Curling once again ends up being the favorite of the four, ironic since it's probably the most boring sport to watch during the Olympics. It's just icy shuffleboard, but there's a bit of strategy involved in scoring the most points.  At the very least, the development studio pretty much comes out of nowhere with a very capable 3D engine for Ultimate Winter Games. The  in the package utilize this engine for their graphics and gameplay, and the programmers push a decent framerate and a good sense of speed in these three events. On top of this, the game's control and collision detection isn't negatively affected by the polygonal engine as it is in many other games that try to push the GBA in a direction it was really never meant to go.  It would have been interesting to see this engine used in the curling event, but even with its own scrolling engine curling looks and plays great...and the addition of playing Curling between two systems with only one cartridge is another feather in the cap.  All of the challenges are definitely fun in their own way, but they're all just a little on the basic side. Each of the games  feel like they're lacking some defining features in their design. For example, it'd be nice to have other competitors on the downhill skiing trail. Or, at the very least, a ~ghost racer~ showing the best time recorded on the course. Snowboarding's trick system, as mentioned above, is extremely basic and just a little unbalanced since players can easily pull off a single trick that will push them over the course's point requirement. And in curling, the fact that you can see where your ~puck~ is going via an on-screen crosshair makes the game less challenging, and it should have been a feature that can be flagged on and off in an option menu.  What's not good about Ultimate Winter Games is its poor attention to presentation. Game progression isn't well designed, since players simply play the same event over and over at a higher difficulty, instead of working through a single player ladder of different events. This issue is fixed for two player hot seat mode since players can decide which events (and how many) to take part in...but for gamers playing by themselves, the championship mode lacks variety.  The biggest problem is the game's lack of cartridge save; because there's no save RAM in the cartridge, players can't record their best times down the hill or best score on a snowboard run, an element that increases replay as a player would be more inclined to try to outdo a performance if the score was kept in memory.  A password code is offered at the end of each level, but cartridge save is far more convenient to save progress, and at this point in the Game Boy Advance's lifespan, if you're going to charge the top tier price for a cartridge you better put that save RAM in there. It's pretty safe to say that Ultimate Winter Games is the top collection of winter sports on the Game Boy Advance, but that's only because the competition on the handheld is a bit on the light side; Eidos' Salt Lake 2002 and Konami's Winter Sports 2002 released on the GBA were incredibly sloppy and unfun experiences. Ultimate Winter Games has four decently designed games of varying challenge and difficulty, but its overall presentation on how it ties them all together into a sellable GBA package is a little more than lacking.", "date": "Jan 28, 2004"}
