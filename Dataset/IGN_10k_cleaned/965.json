{"name": "Grudge Warriors", "name_review": "Grudge Warriors", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/31/grudge-warriors", "text": "After Sony dropped its licensing fees for games, a number of shadier PlayStation developers salivated at the possibility of shoveling games at penny prices. Yet we were still taken aback when we saw Take 2's latest sawbuck twosome -- Grudge Warriors and Spec Ops. It just doesn't feel right throwing a single ten-spot on the counter and then getting change back when your paying for the latest in videogame entertainment. Take 2 doesn't have the same spotless track record as a high roller like Capcom (don't get on our case, Take 2 -- Remember, we loved Thrasher when nobody else gave it a chance), and yet it just doesn't make sense for the to slight their newest projects by dumping them in a bargain bin out of the gate.   It's all part of a marketing strategy on Take 2's part to blow out titles that otherwise might have competed well in the crowded PlayStation field. There are just too many games out there, and a company has to do something different just to get above the noise level. Of course, we at IGN would suggest companies try maybe innovative gameplay, but that's not fair to say in this case, because in Take 2's defense, these bargain games are not half bad. Not much better than half, but not half bad at all.  Gameplay It looks like its supposed to be Twisted Metal. The manual reads like a TM rip-off. The game controls mirror Twisted Metal. Even the title -- Grudge Warriors -- is Twisted Metalish. And, of course, just as logic dictates, the game plays exactly like -- you guessed it... Blaster Master.  Huh? Yeah, that's kind of why you're paying an hours worth of paycheck on this thing. Grudge Warriors just makes no sense, and it ceases to make sense all the while you play it. Eventually gamers may have fun with this thing. In fact, the minute I booted it up and found it fully playable (as opposed to the bargain bin CramWare that PC players often see), with all kinds of rocking tank things to pilot and plenty of weapons to raise hell with, I had a glimmer of glee. But this game just doesn't work out that way.  The set-up involves teams of gangs battling it out in would-be post-apocalyptic landscapes (the nuclear apocalypse wasn't written into this game's storyline, but we've played this type before, so its safe to assume that Take 2 just forgot) in an attempt to -- get this -- prove themselves. Yep, the entire point of this game is to rank highly with lowlifes. No plot, no driving impetus. Just slimelord pride.  The gameplay falls apart as soon as gamers engage combat with the enemy and find out it takes thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of shots to destroy a common gun embattlement. Even big nukes take lots of shells to take somebody out. It's still fun to fight, and the tanks control slowly but surely, but the game isn't a lot of fun because of botched design. The two-player is typical deathmatch versus the strange main mode, but it's still frustrating when even a hunting nuke has zero power.   The layout is strangely differing from Twisted Metal -- you must raid bunkers and blow up targets rather than engage the enemy. The puzzles that players have to solve to get to the next area are just illogical. Sometimes gamers are asked to do something nearly impossible with a tank, and do it repeatedly; Other times, the game is a simple challenge, but the next puzzle solution is so bizarre that players may never get past it. This distant gameplay makes the whole experience dull -- with no plot, no main enemy, and no target, what's the point?  Graphics It may be first-generation quality, but it still works in a rudimentary way. Grudge Warriors has chunky graphics that churn, drop out, clip, break up, and otherwise fail, and the camera is consistently in the most unhelpful of places in tight caverns. However, the framerate is solid at all times, and the play is fast enough that the slack quality is made up for with big environments and complicated battlefields with sloped walls and multitiered buildings. There are also lots of nifty lighting effects that spark up when you shoot. Better than typical bargain rate paint, and more than I expected. Sound If there's a place that Take 2 skimped, it's certainly in the audio department. The deetled synth-rock soundtrack bleeps and hums straight through your consciousness and into your teeth, settling in for the weekend even if you only spend an hour playing. Of course, the explosions are fine, but the arena sound effects outside of booms just blow. Somewhere early in the game, for instance, is a sequence where a siren goes off as players infiltrate a fortress. The sound of this alarm is far and away the most irritating sound since Jim Carrey went  ~AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!~ in Dumb and Dumber. I literally looked around the room to see if something in the building shrill had broken. Imagine getting stuck in Disneyland's It's a Small World After All right next to the speaker, and the record keeps skipping on the ~aft~- in ~After all~ -- then cranked up to 11 and reverberated through a rusty airline hanger with the cross-talk of fingernails on a chalkboard piped in just for good measure.   This game is just nonsense as far as gaming logic. It's kind of like a guy's first visit to the proctologist -- you think you know what's supposed to happen and where things are going to be going, but all along its a lot more uncomfortable than you expected, and things constantly take a turn for the worse, and you keep wondering if maybe there's something you could do or change to help make the experience a little more smooth.", "date": "May 31, 2000"}
