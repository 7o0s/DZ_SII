Chariot of the Dogs focuses from start to finish on the whereabouts of our paranoid inconvenience store clerk, revealing not only the very credible evidence that he's not simply delusional but also a fair bit of information on how he turned out the way he did in the first place. Best of all, it's all done with a sharp sense of humor and a series of challenges that are really just part of one giant puzzle centering around your attempts to rescue Bosco.  Now with most Sam and Max episodes, we've been able to at least dance around the story elements in our discussion of the humor and puzzles that are the real motivation to play these games in the first place. We can't really do that here, simply because so much of the humor of the situation revolves around what's happened to Bosco and what you need to do to save him from the completely ridiculous circumstances he's found himself in.   Let's just say that the whole episode involves Sam and Max's attempts to rescue Bosco from the clutches of the nefarious, and heretofore assumed to be imaginary, T-H-E-M. Naturally a good bit of the motivation to rescue Bosco arises out of the fact that Sam and Max just so happen to have found themselves shanghaied as well, but let's not cast aspersions on their altruistic motivations just yet.  We have to reveal that the bulk of the story involves plenty of visits to the past and the future, which gives you a chance to meet younger and older versions of familiar characters, and even to meet the parents and grandparents of some of the regulars. There are definitely some standouts here, but the best performance is delivered by an Alzheimer's afflicted, future Sam. His lines alone are worth the price of admission here. When you start adding in the number of paradoxes and illogical exchanges that this time-bending episode generates, it's easily one of the funniest episodes to date.  The new characters definitely fit in well with the overall spirit of the series, and the new, sometimes substantial, revelations and enlargements of existing characters provides the opportunity for some truly side-splitting story moments. Sam and Max's interactions with all their past and future selves are particularly inventive and completely true to my own idea of who these characters were, are and are going to be.   One of the most satisfying aspects of this game is that each and every puzzle contributes to your efforts to get Bosco out of the terrible circumstances that he's found himself in. From the very first grade-school science experiment to the soul-snatching shenanigans at the end, the puzzles here have a sense of cohesiveness and purpose (at least by Sam and Max standards), that we just haven't seen before. It makes the story so much enjoyable and meaningful when you can see how each and every little challenge contributes to your overall goal. The player never feels like they're just trying to get through A just to get to B just to get to C. Instead, it feels like you've always got your sights set on the goal and are just knocking down a long line of connected challenges that stand in your way.      And given the time-specific nature of the puzzles, some of them can be quite hard. There are some obvious puzzles where you know what you need to do but not quite how to do it. Then there are cases where you're not entirely sure what to do but you have three or four ideas that are worth trying. Only a handful of times were we completely stuck without any idea of where to go next but this was more a matter of our not considering all the options in front of us. Since each separate time period is represented by a single room, you won't find yourself wandering too much. In fact, the time travel mechanism ensures that there's no backtracking required at all. It makes for a much more focused and intense experience.  Eventually, once you finally get Bosco sorted out, things take an unexpected turn and you're forced to rescue him from yet another convoluted but undeniably engaging encounter with the people he's feared all along. Again, the confrontation with T-H-E-M is hilarious, but we can't really reveal any of the specifics without spoiling the overall concept, which is perhaps the best gag in the entire episode. We will say that the developers score big points for us by actually getting the line from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre right instead of the more popular and incorrect version.   If we're going to be critical, (and you so know we are), we have to admit that the big musical number, while hilarious in theory, tends to fall apart due to some messy lyrics. The idea is great, but the execution left us profoundly unsatisfied. The good news is that the rest of the episode's humor is spot on. The time-traveling aspects allow for a lot more of the zany and anarchic humor we want to see from a dry-witted dog detective and his deranged rabbit sidekick.  Much of the credit of course, goes to the voice actors. As usual, the performances are the perfect compliment to the witty script. We like all of the new characters but T-H-E-Y really steal the show. The music is still brilliant and seems to mix things up a bit more. The visuals are as good as ever, with some particularly good visuals around Bosco and his new environment.  Best of all, the story really ties the season together, which is something that's been missing so far. Heck, it even reaches back into the first season to create a little more relevance and importance. In a way it's a shame that the payoff is so satisfying that we can't really talk about it at all. Even to hint at the possible identity of T-H-E-M and their hilariously depressing birthday curse would dampen your enjoyment when the curtains part and you finally get a chance to see just what's been going on behind the scenes all year.   Chariots of the Dogs is definitely my favorite episode this season, and one of the strongest episodes of the entire series. The way that the designers have taken advantage of the time-traveling aspect to showcase the wacky and chaotic nature of the characters is just inspired. Great writing, great animation and great voice acting support it all the way through. The puzzles aren't just peripheral, throwaway problems designed only to extend the length of the game but are actually legitimate, meaningful parts of the story that provide a nice challenge that never distracts you from why you're trying to solve them. And T-H-E-Y are hilarious.", "date": "Mar 13, 2008"}
