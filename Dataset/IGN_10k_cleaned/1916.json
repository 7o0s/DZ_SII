It's not like you need much to show off the outstanding art style of the show. It's just a shame that no basic videogame can truly capture what makes the Simpsons such a great show to watch  it's not about slapstick animation, it's also about the witty dialogue and extended plot setups. I mean, it's not like you'd make a videogame based on sitcoms like Growing Pains, The Cosby Show, or M*A*S*H (er, scratch that last one...). Game makers have simply fallen back on the Simpsons because it's a cartoon...and cartoons can translate better in videogames than real human actors. And licenses sell, so the Simpson family makes the trek to the license friendly Game Boy Color platform. Even though the game has some decent design elements, it's a bit sloppy in places and can get on the dull side. Features Seven Levels Seven playable characters Password save Only for Game Boy Color  The Simpsons: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horrors was developed by Software Creations, the same team responsible for several of  THQ's Rugrats Game Boy Color games. And it seems the latest Rugrats engine is in use for this action/adventure game, which is definitely favorable to the game's design  we may not have liked the Rugrats games, but we did appreciate the effort that went into making the characters large and the graphics as detailed as possible. The strengths of that engine are put to very good use in this game  character sprites are big and background tiles are vibrant. At the very least, the developers captured what a Simpsons game should look like on the Game Boy Color. They even injected some in-jokes  keep a watch for the three-eyed fish as well as the box of Mr. Sparkle washing detergent.  The game itself is a bunch of scrolling action games, each level is a ~horror~ theme featuring one of the Simpson clan. For starters, you'll play as Bart trying to rescue Santa's Little Helper (his dog) by wandering the haunted Simpson house, grabbing fuses to light rooms in the house so you can grab the necessary keys to unlock other doors. Next, become Maggie as she's been transformed into a housefly (this was a Bart episode, but who's nitpicking) and zoom around the kitchen to grab computer chips and power up the machine that changed her in the first place. Then, become a raygun-weilding Marge as she's out to rid the neighborhood of zombies  with a showdown against Krusty at the end. After that, it's Homer's turn in an action-platformer in Burns' Castle. Even Lisa has a task in another level  rescue the kids locked in the school. Homer takes over for the rest of the game  as Robot Homer in another platform level, and as King Homer in a Rampage-style bash-fest.  The difficulty is certainly there  it's not an easy game to play, and you won't be whisking through this title in an afternoon.  It starts out clever and decent enough, as the first few levels are a good and fun challenge. Most of the levels, though, are based on the first level's side-scroller, and by the time I got to the first Homer level, I was getting quite bored  with all the doors go through and switches to pull, I just didn't care enough to get through this massive castle. And in many instances, the level design just isn't that fair  in the Marge shooter, for example, it's near impossible NOT to get hit at the boss battle no matter what you do. And King Homer? Get all the way to the end of the city and face the boss that'll wipe you out in a single hit...and then it's back to the beginning of the long, drawn-out level. At least there's a password save  but the screen is so hard to look at that it's difficult to type in the necessary text.  The worst part of this game is the sound  as technically good as it is (there are a lot of unique ~instruments~ playing along with the action), it's very grating to listen to the Simpsons theme song played over and over in several different ~spooky~ styles. Hit the volume and turn it down... Ask anyone  the real Simpsons game is the Konami arcade game released more than a decade ago. Beyond this, the license hasn't exactly excelled in the gameplay department in its several videogame series. Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror is a better-than-average platformer for the Game Boy Color, but it has its problems  keeping your attention is its main issue. While I definitely don't have any good suggestions on what would make a fabulous Simpsons game, I have concluded after the dozen or so games for several systems that it's just not possible. You'll just have to settle for ~pretty good~ at best.", "date": "Apr 24, 2001"}
