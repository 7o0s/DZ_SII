Things like Tables of Organization and Equipment and Orders of Battle might put most people to sleep but, thankfully, there are those of us who still think Panzer General is worth the few weeks it takes to figure out how the hell to play it. It's gratifying to see that Shrapnel Games is still committed to bringing that same sort of experience to the desktop. What's sad is that they haven't taken it any further in this case.  Desert Rats takes that same model from the first game (and countless other board games) and transplants it to the North African theater. The classic armored clashes between Patton, Montgomery and Rommel are recreated here in a very traditional format. Players alternate turns (which represent about two hours in the game) and move their armies across some rather dry (haha) hex-based maps of North Africa. Disruption factors and command limits on coordinated attacks are all modeled here.  The battles represented here cover the range of fighting in the North African campaigns, from the Sidi Rezegh late in 1941 to Fondouk in early 1943. Tank battles and infantry battles are both given their fair share of attention here. There's something in almost every scale here, from engagements of a few turns with a handful of units, to gigantic battles that last for days. (Although there are a few ~small~ battles that seem to drag on forever.) The new night attack rules are put to good use at Wadi Akarit. After I had a few minor clashes under my belt, I got a lot of enjoyment out of holding off the Germans at the Kasserine Pass. It's a shame that the 17 scenarios in the game aren't linked into a single campaign, especially considering that many of the battles follow each other so naturally.  All of the units are rendered using standard unit symbols. Anyone who's not familiar with this convention will balk at the prospect of memorizing a whole batch of symbols just so they can tell the difference between tanks and infantry. Thankfully, it's not terribly difficult to get the gist of it all. An ~X~ means infantry, while an oval means armor. An ~X~ and an oval together mean armored infantry. An oval with a dot in the middle of it is artillery. Like I said, it's pretty easy once you get the basics down. Thankfully, there's a nice little sidebar that tells you not only what kind of unit you've selected, but also give you several statistics that will help you determine how best to employ the unit.  The game models the real tactics of the war pretty well too. Most of the game is spent with one side maneuvering around the defenses of the opposition. There aren't any unit facings in the game sadly, so the awesome flanking moves don't necessarily have the same strength here. Bait and gambit type actions seem to be beyond the AI's capability. As with most games of its type, the AI here has a harder time controlling large groups of units than individuals. If you consider how often the Afrika Korps found itself overstretched, this tendency might not actually be a flaw.  The graphics reinforce the notion that this is just a port of a tabletop game. The simple graphics get the job done but no one's going to be impressed with them. The various terrain features (wadi, escarpments, minefields, etc.)  are easy enough to recognize, but they're extremely basic. The little counters that represent the units are subject to two kinds of animations: being hit with little explosions or being shot at with little yellow lines. There's really not much more to the game that. Still, no one who's going to be interested in this game will care that it looks. I did like the addition of some propaganda posters from the period in the interface.  The interface does a good job of smoothing out the action for you, but the frequent pauses created by pop-up messages tend to slow things down. And unless you're running in a really high resolution, managing the information windows while still maintaining a decent view of the map can get tricky. The only other real problem with the interface is that you'll often accidentally move units as you're trying to deselect them. This requires a little adjustment to overcome.  The game offers hotseat multiplayer and play-by-email options. Both features are pretty sweet (although finding opponents might be a concern -- at least for PBEM). One cool feature of the PBEM option is that if you restart a turn, the game sends a message to your opponent saying, ~Dan is a dirty cheater. He restarted his turn.~ Then you can call him names. A scenario editor is included if you can think of a major desert engagement that the game doesn't cover. I can't.  Having said that, I think this title might have made a more inspired use of the format. In the case of Desert Rats, the computer acts as little more than a bookkeeping rules master. While adjudication headaches are probably the number one reason more people aren't playing tabletop wargames, I feel like Boku could have done more here. Where are the summary reports? Where are the battlefield overlays? Or the linked campaigns? These are the kinds of things that Hasbro did very well with with their latest batch of Avalon Hill PC games. Ultimately this is just a tabletop game on the desktop.  The game comes direct from Shrapnel Games so you won't find it in stores. You also won't find it coming in a box or anything like that. Shrapnel sends a manual and a CD to you. Considering the suggested price of $40, you might be better off checking your hobby stores for a copy of Panzer Leader.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
