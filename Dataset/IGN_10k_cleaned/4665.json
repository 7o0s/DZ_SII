And Bandai has managed to throw out the best title we've seen in ages to ensnare an audience: Ace Yeti Trapper. How can you not want to check that out?   Features:  Trap animals  Action/puzzler  Multiple mazes   Ace Yeti Trapper is an unique little puzzler with enough action elements -- and how could there not be any action in a yeti-trapping game? -- to keep you on your toes for quite some time. Now, you don't just start this game and go mano on mano with the abominable snowman. First, you have to practice your skills on less fierce creatures, such as yaks.   Now, setting a trap isn't as easy as dropping a bomb in Bomberman or digging a hole in Lode Runner. You must actually set and prime your trap before scurrying away. That means you must actually scan the maze for some time before deciding on optimal placement. If your quarry is headed your way, you may not get the trap ready soon enough.   There are thirty mazes, each with slightly different appearances. The little creatures look fantastic, especially the monkeys. Who doesn't love monkeys these days? But the yeti himself is the star, and he/she/it looks cute enough to eat. Which, after you airlift him out of Nepal, may be exactly what happens next.A quick review for a quick, charming game. Ace Yeti Trapper is one of those games that is often overlooked because it doesn't have some big movie license attached to it. But it is an engaging action/puzzler that deserves a chance, and Bandai should be commended for bringing it out here.", "date": "Apr 24, 2004"}
