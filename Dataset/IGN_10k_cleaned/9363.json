But we're not reviewing Klondike Solitairewe're reviewing Solitaire Overload. Luckily the same can be said for the rest of the pack, with the biggest issue being that it doesn't cater well to players who are unfamiliar with the other games on the cart. And with literally dozens of variations, you'll most likely be one of these players. But that's okay, at least Klondike will get you started.   There are more than a hundred different games of single player cards in Solitaire Overload, and chances are you've never heard of 99 of them. Everyone knows Klondike since it's included with every PC running Windowsit's the number one time-suck in the corporate world. People play it on their Palm handhelds, their cellphones, even their iPods. And now it's on the Nintendo DSand it's good. As is Freecell, another variation that you'll most likely be familiar with. But then you're faced with an overwhelming number of single player card games that are mysterious and almost alien by name: Little Windmill, Milligan Cell, Penguin, Spiderette. These are apparently real designs, and probably the first time you'll ever experience them. But they all have their own meritsand the design even tells you how heavy each game is in their skill or luck.   The visuals are sharp and easy to read, and the cards are a snap to drag around and drop thanks to tight touch screen and stylus controls. The designers completely rip off Apple's iPod Touch ~cover flow~ interface for its game selection menu, but hey, it works and works well. Games are grouped by family as well as popularity for easy location of your favorite variation. Each game can be sent to as many as sixteen systems at a time using the Nintendo DS Download Play option, completely on-the-flyan excellent way of getting players interested in the product. Solitaire Overload has a pretty good statistics recording option, keeping track of Wins and Losses for each of the 101 Solitaire games, but it doesn't record best times or the dates of when those wins happened.   Nothing says solitaire like scenic pictures from around the world.   With a hundred and one games in its library, you're probably not going to know how to play a huge percentage of the games. And that's where this collection falters. Each game has instructions, but they're written as if you know Solitaire wordagewhich makes the rules somewhat hard to read and understand. To learn the games you pretty much have to poke around and see what the games allow and disallow, and that's a clunky way of understanding the rules sets. And with 101 games in the pack, not every rule variation made it into all games. For example, Klondike has several custom options like one or three card draws, but no matter what you do, you'll never be able to change the fact that cards get locked into their foundation pile permanently. In other words, if you throw a 3 on the suit's Ace pile, you can never pull it off to manipulate the other cards in the gamea standard option in Klondike Solitaire.   It's hard to shake the feeling that Solitaire Overload is a bit of a teasea sort of appetizer for Telegames long-in-development Ultimate Card Games announced way back in 2004. We've been anxiously waiting for Ultimate Card Games ever since the brilliant Game Boy Advance version hit that portable nearly a half decade ago, and Solitaire Overload -from the same publisher and development team - is really the only evidence that it even exists. Perhaps Solitaire Overload was a relatively quick way to ease the anxiousness: take the card engine and create single player games. No need for detailed logic and artificial intelligence since a second player is never needed. At the very least, if this is a taste test to what Ultimate Card Games will end up becoming when or if it finally ships, bring it on.Even if this is a stopgap for the DS version of Ultimate Card Games, Solitaire Overload is still a good product that works well on the handheld. It needs a bit of a boost in the tutorial area, but if you can figure out some of the rules on your own, you've got several dozen games to try and enjoy, many of which will be completely new to you.", "date": "Oct 30, 2007"}
