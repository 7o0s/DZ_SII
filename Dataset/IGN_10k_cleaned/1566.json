{"name": "The Incredible Hulk", "name_review": "Incredible Hulk", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/02/incredible-hulk", "text": "The Incredible Hulk has been around for    years. He's had his own TV series (~You    wouldn't like me when I'm angry...~) and a    few cartoon series. However, fans of the big green lug will be sorely disappointed by this lack-luster effort.     The Hulk has been kidnapped and taken to    a mysterious factory, where he is dropped    off and forced to fend for his life. This    shouldn't be too much of a problem for the    Hulk. Again, we repeat 'shouldn't,' as a game featuring Hulk with his correct level of ability would be way too easy.  Incredible Hulk falls into the 'walk left or right and punch bad guys' genre of games, made popular by Final Fight and Double Dragon. However, it is incredibly tedious here, and the fact that you can maneuver in and out of the screen, a la Crash Bandicoot, doesn't change things.  It isn't as bad as most Acclaim games of the same formula, and is best thought of as part of Eidos' old ways. Look forward to Tomb Raider 2 and leave Incredible Hulk behind.", "date": "Sep 2, 1997"}
