If you're not the least bit interested in placing quotes with movies or picking the correct actor for a role, then don't even bother.   However, if you consider yourself something of a pop culture buff, then this minor distraction may be a worthy download. Our biggest complaint is that there doesn't seem to be all that many questions. After only a few games, we got a few doubles. Oh well. Handsets do have limited space, after all. But it's not like the game really need a bunch of memory for looks. It's pretty plain jane.   We did appreciate the game's attempt at a two-player experience. The game throws out the same questions, and you hand the phone back and forth to answer them. The player with the highest points? The weiner. Er, winner.", "date": "Jul 29, 2004"}
