{"name": "A-Train", "name_review": "A-Train", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/22/a-train", "text": "I'm sure if Gary Coleman owned a PlayStation (and he probably does), A Train would probably be one of his favorite games. Seeing as he's such a model train fanatic, a train sim would be right up his alley. Which presents somewhat of a problem: While A Train is undoubtedly a quality game, is there enough of a specialist audience for it?  You control a small city's railway network, which directly reflects the rest of the city around it. You get to handle general finances and monitor fluctuating train fares, as well as determine how much you should spend on growth. Often you must build bridges, dig tunnels, and track over hills. In a nutshell, it's your basic PC-style sim game, except that it's trains.  Selecting icons and guiding pointers is handled via the joypad, and is probably not the most efficient way to handle a PC-style interface. However, the game is largely enjoyable and, should your passion be trains, or even management sims, you won't be disappointed.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
