Mobile Battles: Reign of Swords is a deep, compelling turn-based strategy game that takes the core elements every gamer loves about Nintendo's Advance Wars series and then drafts them online. Yes -- online. This wizards-and-warrior fantasy game can be played both over the air against human opponents as well as in a very cool mobile-to-PC component. Now, it's not exactly direct combat -- there's some serious automation going on under the hood -- but really, did you want to burn up your whole battery over a protracted catapult fight?   Reign of Swords is split into two campaigns -- single-player and multiplayer. The story-based single-player war is familiar territory for strategy fans. You march across a grid, using terrain types to your advantage, while laying siege to another army -- or, in some missions, several armies. Punch loads the battlefield with 23 different units, from spear-wielding militiamen to shape-shifting druids. Each unit has its strengths and weaknesses, and over time, you learn which units are best against your enemies. You also learn how to best manage the points you can use to raise your armies before each mission. Each unit has a specific cost, and you need to decide if it's better in one circumstance to buy up a bunch of lowly archer rather than splurge on cannons.   After playing a handful of the 49 single-player missions, learning exactly how to play the game as you go, you can then wade online. And while the single-player game is certainly strong, this is where Reign of Swords really explodes.   At first, you must create an online avatar, complete with your own crest. Then, you can challenge other players or accept contest invitations for a variety of missions (28 in all), such as a basic land war or a fortress siege. Then, you use your earned points to purchase the forces you think will best suit your role in the battle. After setting up your forces on the field, you decide the basic tactics for each unit. Once you are satisfied, you hit ~send~ and the battle begins somewhere out in the ether. Punch's AI routines dictate the outcome of the battle depending on how your units and tactical choices stack up against your opponent. After the battle is waged, both you and your friend can find out how the war went down and see where the loser might have gone wrong.   I know some of you hardcore types might complain about not having direct control over the multiplayer action. Go play Advance Wars on your DS. This is multiplayer molded for mobile, designed to be played during stolen moments -- not to be hovered over for an hour at a time while airtime is consumed like Coors Lite at a frat party.   The mobile-to-PC component is fantastic. Since your account is stored on a server, you can just pick up your single-player game on your PC if so desired. This PC component also opens up the field to more players so you're not just limited to whatever audience picks up the game on mobile. Be sure to check out the official site for Reign of Swords to learn more about each unit type, download a demo of the game, and check out some forums to find challengers.   Reign of Swords looks fantastic, despite its exceptionally small unit sprites. It's simple to tell the different units apart, though, and all of the necessary information about each unit as well as the battlefield is easy to read on your phone's screen. The battlefields are reasonably detailed, too, with nice features and good use of color. The game music is also rock solid.  I was looking forward to giving out the first 9 of the year -- and Mobile Battles Reign of Swords certainly deserves the hell out of it. This is an exceptionally deep game, composed of an engaging single-player experience and a highly playable multiplayer component. The automated battles are far from a letdown -- they are perfectly suited for the platform. The PC stuff is an excellent addition, too. If you're in the mood for a sweet turn-based strategy game, you will likely find no better in 2008.", "date": "Feb 7, 2008"}
