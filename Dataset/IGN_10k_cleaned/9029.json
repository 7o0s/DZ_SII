Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos might seem like strange bedfellows at first. After all, the coke-snorting, bee-loving, violin-playing sleuth would no doubt have little common ground with the deranged worshippers of the gigantic, octopus-faced extraterrestrial, but after playing Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened, we think it's a match made in heaven. Or at least, whatever passes for heaven among the Great Old Ones.  When a few immigrants suddenly disappear right in Holmes's very own neighborhood, he and his trusty companion Dr. Watson are drawn into an investigation that leads them around the world, from mental hospitals in Switzerland to the bayous of Louisiana to pirate caves in Scotland. Along the way you'll uncover the mystery of an ancient horror and its unsettling intersection with modern life.   In all, it's a very well written story with plenty of interesting characters, loads of atmosphere and details, and even the odd twist or two. The dialogue is smart and clearly shows that the writer was not only familiar with Doyle and Lovecraft's styles but we also able to incorporate them into a single story that feels as though it could have been written by both authors. We won't spoil any of the specific plot points, but there are plenty of crazed ravings by maniacs and overly long, dry explanations and ruminations by Holmes.  Any game focusing on Sherlock Holmes creates a certain expectation with regard to its difficulty and The Awakened doesn't disappoint. The puzzles here aren't as obvious as in the recent Sam & Max so you'll really have to think about how all the pieces fit together, sometimes literally. There are a few multipart collection quests that basically solve themselves, but even then they lead to other puzzles that require some substantial (but not unreasonable) leaps of logic. You'll find a few reflex oriented or timed puzzles scattered throughout the game. While they make a nice break from the logic puzzles, some of them feel a bit out of place and a few require trial and error before you're even sure how to manipulate them.  Rather than being a boring pixel hunter where you mouse-over every possible item on the screen, The Awakened will often snap your icon towards an important clue or object. This frees up the player to spend more time imagining how the items they find might be used to solve the larger puzzles at hand rather than wasting time scouring every square inch of the environment in hopes of finding a crucial missing piece. That's not to say that finding items is easy, because there are plenty of items that are tucked away in less obvious locations. In a few cases, the items you need are even hidden inside other items you're already carrying. Nice touch.   From time to time, you'll come upon a clue that begs to be investigated further, prompting Holmes to pull out his trusty magnifying glass to take a closer look. Often there are important details to be seen in unlikely places, so it pays to try a little pixel hunting here. Even so, it feels more like a real investigation than tedious busy work. Holmes even has a lab (desk, really) where he can examine items in greater detail under a microscope, or even run chemical tests on them in some bizarre gyroscopic burner.       Unfortunately, there are some game killers here that require you to replay portions of the game if you miss an important clue. Once we failed to pick up a small syringe during a crucial timed sequence only to discover that we needed it several minutes later. This wouldn't have been quite so galling if the sequence hadn't come after a lengthy cutscene that can't be skipped. So one simple oversight meant we had to play through another twenty minutes of the game, not counting the ten minutes we spent trying to figure out if there was a way around our mistake.  We love how the game collects and collates information for you. You'll always be able to go back and review details of conversations you've had or clues you've gathered so you never really feel like you're at a total loss for where to go next. Still, there are those moments where Holmes will turn to Watson and say, ~Of course! We need to go to ____!~ and then expect you to fill in the blank. An educated guess is usually good enough but it's one area where the game seems to require you to predict exactly what it wants you to say.   Another feature of Holmes's investigation notebook is a fast travel map. Given the size of some of the environments, it's nice to be able to jump right to Baker St whenever the need arises, or to revisit a crucial location once you've unlocked a new clue or object that can be of use there. By eliminating a lot of the tedious running around, the developers have definitely kept the story moving in the right direction. The story snags a bit on the more lengthy cutscenes but only because the rest of the action is so immediate.  The Awakened's visuals are an unexpected treat. Played out in a first-person perspective, the game really puts the players right in the heart of the action with large and very detailed areas to explore. Sherlock's home at Baker Street is filled with so many great details that fans of the character will pick up on. Even in the other locations players can stumble across newspapers, paintings, ashtrays and all the other little bits and pieces that make the rooms and levels seem like people actually use them.  Character models are also particularly good with solid animations and excellent facial textures. Just the facial hair alone is enough to earn our compliments. Beyond that, the characters are further fleshed out with loads of personality both in their facial expressions and their meticulous wardrobes. In fact, the only thing that we don't like about the models is that they're just not as well lit as the environments.   The audio supports the action nicely. Each of the voice actors turns in a commendable performance, although the overall Britishness of the cast keeps things a bit reserved, even during some of the pants-crappingly scary moments. What happens to that body on the altar would no doubt draw a curdling (and assuredly girly) scream from Dr. Watson himself. Some of the cutscenes can get a little wordy from time to time, but the performances are almost always worth paying attention to, both for their quality and for the chance that you'll pick up on a clue. There are plenty of great sound effects and some very convincing ambient sounds and music in most of the levels as well.It might be going too far to suggest that you'll like The Awakened even if you're not a fan of adventure games, but for those adventure fans who are looking for smart puzzles and a sophisticated story, this game has it in spades. The combination of Sherlockian sleuthery and Cthonic cultists is such a natural fit that you never question that the two not only can exist together, but that they were ever apart from each other to begin with.", "date": "Sep 13, 2007"}
