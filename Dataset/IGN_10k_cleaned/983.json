The series was in it's prime about the same time at Street Fighter hit its peak, and was regarded by some as a superior fighting game. Eschewing the combo-heavy fighting system that was Street Fighter, SS instead offered up a slower, more finesse-based system, where light and medium slashes could be combined for a slower, but more powerful attack, as well as a kick and block buttons.     Samurai Showdown also offered something that Street Fighter never really could: a definite style. The game reeked of Japanese manga designs and execution (and with the word ~Samurai~ in the title, it had better deliver), but more than that displayed a definitive attitude. Showdown's animations were big, bold and in glorious hand-drawn 2D.       Enter Samurai Showdown: Warrior's Rage, SNK's 2nd attempt at a 3D fighter based on its most lucrative 2D licenses. The first was the abysmal Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition, and I'm sorry to say, Samurai Showdown fares no better than SNK's first try. The graphics are horrible, the sound is average, and the overall transition into 3D fares slightly better than that monkey in The Fly that ended up inside out. In short, this game is crap. Trouble is, it's packed with extras. Not great extras, mind you, but lots of em.     Gameplay  There are a number of problems with SS: WR's setup, namely the decision to place the game 20 years later than the previous SS games. This virtually omits any of the tried-and-true Samurai that have been establish in the series. Warrior's Rage includes Hanzo and Haomaru from the past games, but they're 20 years older now, and not the badasses of yesteryear.  This 20 year difference really hasn't cultivated any sort of interesting story, it just serves as a means for introducing new characters.       From what I could gather from the cryptic intro video and manual, Warriors Rage takes place as I said 20 years after the events in the other Samurai Showdown games. One lone Samurai is charged with the task of bringing down the leader of a powerful gang that has taken over a once-peaceful island. Yup, it's old hat, but at least you have something to go on. You are also charged with the task of rescuing Rimururu, which unlocks the Attack Mode, but more on that later.     As I said before, Samurai Showdown isn't a game of furious button mashing, it's more a game of finesse, and so if you come into the game with an attitude of ~I'm gonna pull off a 56-hit combo~, you're going to be even more disappointed.  While there are no rounds to speak of, the action is split up into 3 separate sections. As your life bar drops, the action is paused at key moments while you or your opponent taunt each other. You can really be on a roll, pounding out furious fits of slashing, only to have the action cut short by a lengthy pause and the momentum totally shift.     In each battle, there are a few old Samurai there is the classic POW meter that builds with each hit. Once it fills to the brim, you can then choose to disarm your opponent with a well-placed attack, thus negating most of his attacks (at least until he or she picks it up again), or pull off a special throw move. There's also the added ability to unleash the Rage Explosion, which allows you perform a super combo or an unblockable slice, but only as long as the Rage Explosion's effects are present. Sure, powered-up supermoves aren't anything new in fighting games, but if you don't include them by now, the game will just feel empty.     The real meat of the game however, is unlocked after you've beaten it once in Story mode. That's when Attack mode is unlocked, and it opens the door for a host of other features. Attack mode is the basis for all of the other extras in the game. Points earned in Attack mode can be used to unlock the gallery or customize your fighter's moves. The points are earned through the mode's 3 different missions, each mission containing 5 levels. The levels themselves are unlocked as the first three characters you choose in Story Mode rescue Rimururu (beat the game). The levels offer varying point values depending on the mission difficulty, which can be as simple as defeating an opponent while crippled with a low life bar, to defeating as many enemies as possible within a time limit.     Graphics   One of the best things about Samurai Showdown  if not the best  is the amazing attention to detail found in many of the character animations. Back when Street Fighter 2 hit the arcades, coin-op junkies were already drooling over the slick, smooth almost cartoon-like animation of the competing SNK brawler. Sure, Capcom eventually won out in the battle for fighting supremecy, it is still the Samurai Showdown that will boast superior animation and design.     But then SNK decided to bring it all into 3D, and that's the day the magic died. Gone are the complex, smooth animations of the 2D era, replaced by poorly modeled, blocky pieces of garbage that have no business being on screen. These models lack all of the artistic flair of their 2D cousins, instead they look more like the models used in earlier PlayStation fighters like Battle Arena Toshinden. There's nothing wrong with having blocky models, 3D brawlers like Tekken and Street Fighter EX lack the smoothness found in arcade fighters, but they still manage to look good. Here, I actually spotted instances of what looked like texture placeholders popping through on models, throwing small chunks of checkerboard pattern onto previously covered areas. This may have been excusable if everything in the game was textured, but the only other object that has anything painted on it is the ground.     Unlike Tekken or Street Fighter EX, however, Warriors Rage takes place on only two dimensions. This allows for some nicely detailed animated backgrounds, which range from a pine tree-laden forest to a the burned out remnants of a village. It's obvious that SNK is good at 2D art, made all the more apparent by the stark contrast in quality from the backgrounds to the fighters. That's not to say the models are poorly animated, they still offer up some semblance of style, but it's nothing compared to it's 2D roots.      Sound Like so many other games out there, SS: WR's sound is good, but it's not amazing. All of the old slashes and swipes that are oh-so Samurai Showdown are here, and it's a welcome sound to my ears. But if you're expecting to anything remotely resembling English you're SOL. Nobody speaks a lick of it, from the announcer to the characters, and for good reason: this game is all about Samurai. Should the individual stages offer something like a waterfall or a burning bonfire, you'll be sure to hear it here, and it sounds great, but there is a problem: it's all very muted. I wish there was some sort of option to turn up or down the music or effects, but the only control you have over the sound is whether it's in stereo or mono.      Warriors Rage's ambience is held together by the consistent Japanese overtones found throughout the music, with light harp plucks and sharp whistles to move things along, amidst deep booms of drums and slight harmonica melodies. If you've heard anything remotely resembling Japanese music, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. It's done fantastically, and is the only real tie to those great previous Samurai Showdown games.    Like so many other games out there, Samurai Showdown: Warriors Rage could have been good. It had a lot going for it: strong art style, great sound and music, and an established set a characters to bring into 3D. But unlike Capcom, who took it's best fighters from the Street Fighter series and fleshed them out, SNK opted to use mainly new characters and didn't do anything to make them seem alive.  Sure, the bonuses you'll find will keep you coming back, if you can stomach the lousy graphics and poor overall presentation, but it's a long stretch. Let's hope that SNK's sequel or a possible Art of Fighting 3D translation will fare better, because this one didn't quite make it.", "date": "Jun 3, 2000"}
