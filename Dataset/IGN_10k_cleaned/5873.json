Sometimes it turns out well, as with Far Cry or Chronicles of Riddick. Most times, though, ambition is best left to the folks who have a few notches under their belts. While Boiling Point  has some great ideas and manages to blend different genre ideas smoothly, it could have benefited from some more time on the oven range.   In Boiling Point, you play Saul Meyers, a man of indeterminate disposition whose journalist daughter has disappeared in the fictional South American nation of Realia. It turns out that Saul is a decorated soldier, but you wouldn't know it by the way he initially mishandles virtually every weapon he gets his hands on. I can appreciate the potentially fun aspect of training a character to use different weapons and such, but if the man is a veteran Legionnaire (with an impeccable American accent), instinct tells me he should be able to do things like squeeze off an assault rifle round pretty much 100% of the time. Instead, Saul appears to have as much facility with an M16 as I would with an F-22 jet fighter. This inability to effectively pull the trigger is particularly troublesome when multiple individuals are already shooting at me. But let's move on.   Because before I get much farther, it would be unfair to Deep Shadows to not mention their technically impressive graphics engine. Although it doesn't have the polish of Far Cry, it is a 240 square mile zone with no load times. And the terrain engine isn't too shabby. There's lots of foliage, ridges, mountains, ditches, rivers, bridges, et cetera, and the view distance is nice as well. If you're concerned that this beast of a playing field won't run smoothly, well -- actually, you might be right.   The recommendation on the retail box is for a 3GHz Pentium 4, 1 gigabyte of RAM, 4GB of hard drive space, a DVD-ROM drive, and a 256MB 3D card. The in-game options have a host of options you can tweak, but they aren't all self-descriptive, and there aren't any pop-ups that explain the terminology. Fortunately, the slim manual makes some helpful suggestions. But when it comes right down to it, you're going to need a pretty respectable computer. And I hate to say it, but the visuals don't quite justify the requirements. Although the terrain is pretty nice, the character models, vehicles and animations aren't that great, the towns feel under-populated, and the plentiful forests don't have much activity either, beyond scattered rebel patrols and a smattering of wildlife. The land is dotted with points of interest, mind you, but the great stretches of forest in between feel a little lifeless.     Over the course of my play time, in fact, two hundred and forty square miles didn't feel like a feature so much as an obstacle. You can't appropriate a car like you can in GTA or even Mafia. For one, parked cars are almost entirely prohibited from entry, and occupied vehicles have to have their drivers killed in their seats, which decreases your faction standing (more on that in a minute). As with pedestrians and bystanders, there aren't a lot of cars roving around, as though Saul is wandering through a 24-hour siesta. Cars also needed to be refueled periodically, repaired when needed, and even have their tires swapped out if you drive them for long enough. These activities can only be done at sparsely distributed gas stations, but fortunately the costs are relatively low.   What isn't fortunate is the driving model. For a game with such an astounding amount of just driving from point A to point B, you'd think there would be a much more satisfying design here. Instead, it's one of the most aggravating experiences I've had behind the virtual wheel. From the uneasy sensation of just sliding along the ground, to the bewildering difficulty of taking a turn at high speed, driving in Boiling Point is something you'll want to do as little as possible but simply cannot avoid. And as a vehicle takes damage, its handling becomes even worse, making an innocuous turn behave like a hard pull on the emergency brake, spinning the car around violently. Imagine having to deal with this unpredictable twitchiness for a solid ten minutes while you wind your way through hill and dale.   The icing on the cake are details like indestructible park benches, apparently rudimentary motorist AI, and people randomly shooting at you and blowing your tires out when you're just passing through. The driving model in Boiling Point just needs a lot of work, in my opinion. And sadly, even the vehicle sound effects can't salvage the day and make me think I just might be hallucinating this whole problem. The engines sound generic and weak. There is a host of vehicles to choose from, granted, with boats, tanks, planes, helicopters and many things in between, but that's pretty much the best thing I can say about this aspect of the game. If there had at least been some kind of radio I could use, even by putting some MP3s in one of the game's directories, I might have been able to handle the tedious and awkward slogging from one end of the jungle to another.    Speaking of random homicidal intentions, the faction system doesn't fare as badly. You'll have six different groups in the game, and doing jobs for one will lower your standing with at least one other. It's also weighted, so that you'll have to do extra work to get back in good standing with the other guys the deeper you go in with their adversaries. And you will be asked to do things very early on that would have you marked as Public Enemy #1 in real life, like raiding a military base and assassinating a high-ranking officer, or slaughtering a wave of troops descending on your client's jungle headquarters.   While this system is fairly well thought out, there is the annoying factor of instant identification. You could be in the middle of nowhere when you kill a lone individual, but the faction system knows about it instantly and adjusts accordingly. You are recognized on sight, even at a good distance and in a vehicle, and shot at by civilian fruit sellers and grandmothers. Everyone in Boiling Point is packing heat, but it's impossible to both stay on everyone's good side and make progress with the main plot. You'll have to go into town on a regular basis, and it's only the low street population that allows you to get in and out in one piece, because you'll be getting shot at the whole time you're there, if you've done a few jobs for the rebels situated in the jungle. On the other side of the coin, traveling off-road in the forest is a Russian roulette if you've hired yourself out as a government thug. It's not as lethal as in the GTA games, but it's still a complication I could do without.   Thankfully, the on-foot action is respectable, aside from a decorated soldier who can barely fire his sidearm. You can salvage weapons, ammo, and miscellaneous items from bodies (particularly health syringes and body armor). And your character model is separated into multiple zones you can heal individually. Further, if your leg is badly injured, you'll walk with a limp, and drinking alcohol can temporarily ruin your motor skills and blur your vision. You can aim at specific body points on other people and reduce their mobility as well (assuming the weapon fires when you actually pull the trigger, natch). Enemies will actually make a decent effort of not running at you guns blazing and will even lie in wait sometimes, behind boxes or around corners. Unfortunately, the items you scavenge can only be resold for a pittance, and you'll be nearly immobile if you fill up your inventory. Still, there's a royal butt load of weapons to choose from, with melee weapons, rifles, sidearms, crossbows, grenades, SMGs, explosives and more awaiting your hot little hands.     The game is dotted with nice little touches, but ~dotted~ is the key word here, as the whole shebang is stretched so thin across a huge play area. You can upgrade your weapons in many aspects, like larger clip size and faster reload time. You can make your own waypoints on a map, and annotate it with whatever you want. You can store things in a car trunk when you run out of inventory space. The event journal is descriptive and helpful (just clicking on an active entry will pop up a waypoint on the map). But there's just way too much driving around through uninteresting territory, behind the wheel of a vehicle that behaves more like a drunken cow. If the driving model had gotten some more work, and the terrain gotten hit with a shrink ray, I could probably manage to have some fun. Instead, Boiling Point never gets beyond a simmer.
