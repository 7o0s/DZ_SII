Coming upon a familiar landmark or location brings back some awesome memories for those of us who remember what Norrath used to look like. Such is the case with the latest expansion, Rise of Kunark. Though it wasn't one of our favorite areas in the original game, we were anxious to see what the team had to offer us this time around.  While the style has changed quite a bit, geographically speaking, it was the overall changes in the way the world is put together that really impressed us most. Rather than relying on the hard zone edges of previous titles in the series, Kunark uses a new method of zone blending that really makes the world feel more real. Instead of passing over glaring zone lines that have entire climates changing in the space of a single pixel, Kunark gradually eases players into new zones with absolutely no breaks for loading and no harsh transitions between the visuals.   Now when you journey up to the icy peaks above Dreg's Landing, you'll actually see the environment start to turn chilly bit by bit. Of course, for the sake of manageable travel times, the transitions are still pretty drastic but they blend contrasting areas together so nicely that you really get sucked into the world. What's especially nice is how the transitions get you ready, mentally speaking, to experience an entirely different kind of content. The sickly haze of the Fens or the oppressive gloom of Karnor's Castle help set the mood perfectly.  Of course, the serious mood is somewhat ruined by the Chokemon quest, but that's a minor issue.  Since there are no hard zone lines, you can be prepared to have some long running trains that chase you across multiple areas. They'll still give up after a while, but you may find yourself running a bit farther just to make it happen.   The transitions are just as spectacular when you're flying over them, either on the back of a griffin or, later in Kunark, a sokokar. There are plenty of flying posts in Kunark and Timorous Deep but you'll have to unlock their use early on by completing a specific quest. This is a nice little addition that adds a bit of story around the otherwise under appreciated mounts.  The new player experience focuses on the new playable race, the dragon-like Sarnak. Designed as magically-bred fighters, they can definitely hold their own against the rest of the player races. Some players like the customization options for the Sarnak -- lots of horns and such -- but, to me, they really just look too much alike. Apart from a surplus of horn arrangements and colors, the only thing you can really do to distinguish your Sarnak from another is change the shape of his or her muzzle. Hey, at least the helmets are custom fit to the Sarnak's unusual head shape.  The starting character experience is very attractive. Players will begin taking part in the initial conflicts between the Sarnak and their neighbors, the birdlike Spiroc. Eventually, the quests will take players farther and farther away and put them into conflict with pirates, panthers and predatory plants. Personally, I don't like it as much as the Faydwer content, but it's still a very attractive package and one that held our attention all the way up through level 20. As in other new player expansions, the content here is kind of isolated from the rest of the world but that gives new players a chance to get their feet wet without lots of other distractions.      The geography and the quest spaces are well designed but the Sarnak city of Gorowyn is a bit of a mess. It's all platforms and ramps and there's very little to distinguish one area from another, making it nearly impossible to recognize which area you're in without targeting the NPCs that are standing there. The platforms and ramps are connected in a very linear fashion but a series of elevators and moving cars makes it easy to get a little disoriented, especially when you're trying to find an area above or below you. Nevertheless, the city has everything a player needs, practically speaking, so it serves its function as a convenient hub towards the latter part of the Sarnak story.  Unfortunately, the Sarnak quest line dies out right in the middle of the story. We won't spoil things by giving away the last quest, but let's just say that it seems to be building to something and then just cuts it off with no payoff. It's just as bad that the game doesn't really make much of an effort to give players some direction towards the game's existing content. Sure, the emissary from Freeport is nice and there are a couple of portals you can use to get to the other continents, but once you complete the hundred quests on Timorous Deep, you're left too much on your own.   Players will definitely need to head off to explore the game's other content before coming back to see what the rest of Kunark is like. Kunark is as deadly an area as you're likely to see in all of EverQuest II, so it's not to be entered into lightly. There are a couple of ways you can get your veteran characters there. In our case, we found a helpful griffon trainer near the Butcherblock docks who was happy to point us in the right direction. As an added bonus, there's even a Sarnak quest giver in Butcherblock to help tie the new content into the rest of the world.  Once you land in Kunark, you'll have a number of quests right in front of you, from bashing some nearby baddies to investigating some larger playing areas. Although there are some stunning vistas here, Kunark does a great job of limiting the wide-open views found in the rest of the world and carefully positioning landmarks so that players will be drawn to areas of interest. Whether it's a ruined tower in the distance or a path that turns out of sight beyond a hill, there's almost always an obvious indicator of where you can find something new to do. As always the quest givers do a good job of constantly enlarging your playing area by sending you out into new areas and eventually even handing you off to quest givers in other towns and camps.  One of the bigger challenges (or aggravations, depending on your patience) is that the game eventually asks you to start interacting with quest givers and merchants in towns where you're attacked on sight. Thankfully, there are quest lines that help you find favor (or at least tolerance) with the Rilissians, but most of those quests require you to fight your way through the very people you're trying to help. It's certainly an interesting approach to content design, but it still causes some irritating complications.   Still, since Kunark is designed specifically to take players from the current level cap of 70 all the way up to the new cap of 80, it makes sense that the area is deadly, all the way from the start in Dreg's Landing to the Skyfire Mountains. Along the way players will have to battle a wide range of creatures and beasts, including Iksar soldiers and giant wyrms. Some of those enemies you initially encounter can even become your allies and open up entirely new stories that see you fighting against new opponents.      Things have improved on the economic side as well. Tradeskill level caps have been raised and the entire crafting process has been made easier, from start to finish. Your crafting career actually begins with a sort of tutorial quest that does a better job of introducing players to the concepts. Further streamlining is offered by not requiring players to equip harvesting implements every time they want to gather something from the environment. It's a little weird seeing players fish with their hands but what can you do?  Of course, Kunark contains all the qualitative additions you'd expect from an expansion. There are plenty of new monsters and loads of new equipment, including Epic Weapons for each of the character classes. The new visual assets fit well with the game's overall aesthetic. The sokokar are definitely a highlight of the game's graphics, not just for the stunning vistas they reveal but also for their intriguing design. On the other hand, the Throm seem like they were taken out of the oven a bit too soon. Their droopy feature and bland textures stand out from the rest of the game.   Finally, Rise of Kunark comes packaged in a new retail box that includes all the EverQuest 2 content released to date, making it a fantastic deal for players who want to take their first steps into Norrath.As with the previous expansions, there's nothing here that will convince you the EverQuest II is worth playing if you've already decided to pass on it. But for players who are looking to extend the life of a game they already love, Kunark offers lots of amazing diversions.The new player experience is solid (if a little isolated) and the high level content is something you can't find anywhere else. If you're not already bumping your head against level 70 then you can safely hold off on getting Kunark for a while. The new Sarnak content is bound to be attractive to some mid-level players, but it's clear that Kunark is being aimed at the hardcore and newbie crowds.", "date": "Nov 30, 2007"}
