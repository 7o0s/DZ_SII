{"name": "Shadow of Destiny", "name_review": "Shadow of Destiny", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/07/shadow-of-destiny-2", "text": "Created by the mastermind who directed the cerebral and disturbingly horrific Silent Hill, Shadow of Destiny is a certainly a different kind of adventure game. Taking Silent Hill as a cue, Konami's designer has created an even more convoluted story that centers on solving the mystery of your very own murder by going back in time to change events that led up to your death or by direct actions to avoid the murder. It is played from the third-person perspective with 10 chapters in total and a different murder to be solved in each.  Gameplay Shadow of Destiny is almost completely devoid of any classic action-oriented gameplay elements, as it doesn't contain any jumping, fighting, or even moving around blocks or cutting grass with a sword. The game is a pure adventure game where the storyline unfolds through realtime cinematic cut scenes with speech that make up the majority of the game's play time.   Even though the game contains no action, per se, it's far from something that could be described as boring. The general pace of the game is a bit slow and the story is little confusing at the onset, but once you get about an hour or two into it, nothing outside of a wife in labor or a burning house will get you to put down the controller. The storyline is one of the deepest and most engaging that has ever been told through a videogame.   And while the game can be completed in less than six hours the first time through, there are multiple endings that all must be seen to get the full experience out of the game. The endings are all completely different and each contains major plot twists the size of the revelation in The Sixth Sense, so they're definitely something that we highly suggest opening up.   The problem with the game is that it's not a game as much as it is an interactive movie. Although this isn't a problem for me, some gamers might not want to play something that has them spend more time watching and listening to cut scenes and moving a character around the screen.  Graphics Shadow of Destiny definitely isn't in the same league as Sega's stunning Shenmue when it comes to visual excellence, but it isn't too shabby in its own right. The level of texture detail on the game's characters is a bit low, as many seem almost flat shaded, the animation of the main character during gameplay is a bit stiff, and some of the background elements are really low-res and regular PlayStation-quality. But, on the other hand, some of the background textures are amazingly detailed and the different lighting and particle effects being used are often breathtaking.   Furthermore, the animation of the characters during the realtime cinemas are often so lifelike that you might be able to convince yourself that these are real people acting out the scenes. There are just a ton of little facial expressions, hand gestures and changes in the characters' postures that help make everything almost seem real.  The biggest problem is that most of the game is played with black and white backgrounds, so players are by and large looking at some dull visuals.   On the other hand, there are some levels that are just gorgeous. Particularly, when it's nighttime in the town, the game's excellent lighting really comes to the fore and the streets are a sight to behold. The snow effects are also very nice and it's just a shame that the game's beauty has to be lessened by the inclusion of some really bad background textures in some areas.  Sound The audio in the game is probably its most impressive aspect. And considering that the majority of the game is spent listening to the characters speak to one another, this is an area that could've easily destroyed the game. Except for a few of the game's annoying characters, such as the little girl with the high-pitched squeaky voice, the voice acting is first-class. Most lines are delivered in a realistic manner, and even though some are poorly written and a bit cheesy, they're never so bad that it ruins the cinematic experience of the game.   And what's even better than the voice acting is the game's incredible background music and sound effects. The music is generally light-hearted and a bit subdued, but it peaks at the right moments and helps add an extra feeling of suspense and mystery to the adventure. The sound effects are equally impressive, as everything from the chirping of birds to the sound of wind really help add a lot to the game's mystifying atmosphere.   Just in case you're the kind of person that likes to skip to this section and check out the final score instead of reading all of the text, let me make some points doubly clear. There isn't any traditional action at all in this game and not even a single action element to speak of. There's no pulling and pushing boxes, there's no forklift driving, there's no punching or kicking, there's no shooting, and you definitely can't shoot guys in the crotch in this game. The gameplay simply involves the player moving the character around a 3D world, with the only thing close to real action being the ability to run instead of just walk. Shadow of Destiny is a murder mystery and its enjoyment comes in the form of a captivating storyline that will pull you in so deeply that you won't want to stop playing until you finish the quest. And once you've done that, you'll likely want to keep playing over and over again until you've unlocked all of the various endings that are truly worth seeing and completely rewarding because they'll fill you in on the game's different secrets and characters. Unlike most games with multiple endings, you're just not getting the entire story here until you've seen each and every one of them. This definitely isn't a game for everyone, but if you're okay with a game that relies solely on its storyline and puzzle solving, then Shadow of Destiny is a must-own title and one of the sleeper hits of the year for PlayStation 2.", "date": "Mar 7, 2001"}
