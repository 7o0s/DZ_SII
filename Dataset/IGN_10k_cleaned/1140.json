Even more interesting to think that, having played two specimens thereof (Pokemon Trading Card and SNK Vs. Capcom), I actually have about as much experience with the card battle RPG as anyone in this country, to go along with my hideous memories of addiction to the five-color crack cards.  So I suppose I'm qualified to judge a game like Monster Rancher Battle Card.  You can see, I think, by the orgy of hemming and hawing that's just kicking into gear, that I didn't enjoy the game a whole heck of a lot.  It's hard to peg exactly why, but given that I did enjoy previous adventures in collecting-trading-battling, I suppose it boils down to particulars of its game system and more general visual design.  In other words, I think there are better-looking and better-playing card games out there, ones with the added bonus of portability.  If all you've got is a PlayStation and/or you're really into Monster Rancher, your mileage may vary.  Battle Card is a surrogate for the actual game of Monster Rancher both literally and figuratively.  The idea is that, in the game world, kids too young to actually raise their own monsters and take them into battle played a card-game simulation instead, collecting and trading their way to the top of the Monster Card Association tournament ladder.  But the cards happen to be more than just toys.  The game's story begins when you give your young friend a birthday present - a Phoenix card, the last one she needs to complete her set.  Unfortunately, a curse is on her Monster Plate, and when the complete set is all neatly arranged to display on the mantelpiece, zap - she's transported off to the Paradise of Monsters.  Which is apparently a bad thing, although I wouldn't mind taking off to a Paradise for the weekend.  Anyway, your task is to build another complete set, and thus rescue her from Paradise.  Which is as interesting a mission as I've ever seen a videogame, although what you have to do to carry it out may not necessarily be your speed.  To become the mightiest card breeder of all time, you have to explore the world, see things, meet people, discover new territories, enter tournaments, and play Battle Card.  Play a whole, whole lot of it.  The question then arises, what is Battle Card in the specific sense?  I haven't had enough exposure to the post-Magic CCG market to give it an equivalent in that realm, but luckily, it's sufficiently reminiscent of Pokemon and SNK Vs. Capcom to make for valid comparisons between the lot.  Like Pokemon, you've got a limited roster of monsters to use, but like SvC, you field multiple characters at once.  Each deck you create is built around just three monsters, which battle from the beginning of a game to the end - they're all you have, and you lose once they're all knocked out.  The other forty-seven cards in your deck are mainly skill and attack cards for those monsters, along with Breeder cards that have effects independent of the monsters on the field.  Thus, decks tend to be very specialized - perhaps four-fifths of the cards in any given deck can only be used with the monsters in that deck, and it'll have very few cards in common with any of your other decks once you start acquiring more than a few monsters.  This makes for a lot of variety if you're willing to take advantage of it.  The number of possible three-monster decks is pretty vast, and each monster has plenty of specific attacks and special skills.  This means, however, that while there's plenty of variation between individual battles, there's very little in each battle, and combat early on - when you've only got a few monsters to build your team with - can get pretty repetitive, using the same monsters and attacks over and over.  It's not quite as immediately interesting as something like SNK Vs. Capcom, where you started out with a deck full of cool characters to burn through.  Burning through your deck is something you do an awful lot of in Battle Card.  The game is designed such that cards are both the actions they produce or fuel for other cards.  Each turn, you draw to a hand of five cards, and have the choice of either using some of those cards in the attack phase or going on to the GUTS phase.  GUTS are the energy points you use to power attack and skill cards, and you create them by discarding the cards you don't want at the end of each turn, one card to one GUTS.  This makes for an interesting strategic hurdle you have to leap, which is overcoming your attachment to the bird in the hand.  Basically, any card you have that you cannot execute with your current supply of GUTS is of no use.  Saving it only staves off the time when you'll have enough GUTS to use it, unless it's an extremely rare and powerful card.  Strong attacks aren't all that hard to come by in the game, though.  When you get a new monster, it almost always comes with a stack of different attack cards, many of which are enough to kill an opposing monster in one shot.  The best offensive strategy, it turns out, is sacking nearly all of your cards in the early going.  The computer, at least on the lower levels of difficulty, is pretty conservative, and you can gain a quick advantage by canning your entire first hand.  If you draw a strong attack in one of your next couple of turns, you can deal some serious hurt to an enemy monster, and the loss of even one monster is a serious detriment.  Not only do you lose some of your offensive capability, it means that one-third of the cards you draw are now useless.  On the other hand, you then have no reason not to burn those cards in the GUTS phase, which leads to a potentially volatile endgame in some battles.  When your back is to the wall with only one monster left, you can indiscriminately plow through your deck in search of the one attack card you need to turn the tide.  But then that should really be your strategy throughout the battle, it seems.  I won some very easy victories against equivalent opponents by sacking nearly every card I drew, keeping only a dodge card or two handy (dodge cards let you nullify an attack at little to no cost in GUTS) and using powerful attacks as they came.  A nickel-and-dime offense will give you a small early edge, but the tables tend to turn once your opponent gets off his tail and counterattacks.  Enough with the nuts and bolts - is the card game fun?  For myself, I'd have to say that I've enjoyed other games more.  In part that's due to the console presentation.  Monster Rancher doesn't move with the speed of its handheld counterparts - attacks are illustrated by cutscenes that wear out their welcome pretty fast (man, I can't get away from those things these days), and you have to click past the running commentary from your opponent (very little of which is worth reading).  It's faster than something like Magic, but SNK Vs. Capcom stilll comfortably reigns as far as speed and flash is concerned, and it doesn't have the depth of team and energy management that marks Pokemon Trading Card.  There is the simple lack of variety in each battle that I mentioned before.  The translation is so weak that some dialogue and directions are hard to understand - also, for the trivia-minded, Tecmo still can't transliterate ~savate~ correctly.  And to top it all off, if I were to give awards to the character design in Pokemon, SvC, and Monster Rancher, MR would be in third - the human characters have an endearing look, but the monsters don't possess Pokemon's ineffable appeal or SvC's fan-frenzy inspiration potential, especially given Battle Card's lack of animation and 2D presentation.  They looked much better in 3D in the mainline Monster Rancher games.  The one interesting advantage that Monster Rancher possesses is borrowed from the series it descends from - take your CD collection to the Laboratory and you can spawn cards from other music or game CDs.  This feature gives a heck of an advantage to people with large CD collections and a lot of patience.  You can create some pretty powerful cards this way, but each CD can only be used once, and it takes a while to sit through the swapping and loading process.  I happen to have a whole lot of CDs, but I don't know if I'd have the energy to swap in every single one of them.  It is, however, fun in a weird sort of way to see what card comes out of what sort of CD - Fear of a Black Planet, the Big-O OP/ED single, Johnny Cash's Sun Years collection, or what have you.  You know, it occurs to me that an awful lot of people simply saw the top of this review, thought ~A card game?  Monster Rancher?~, and immediately ceased to bother.  Thus, I thank those of you who stayed on for the duration.  I'm afraid, however, that unless you really want to sample the full range of card battle action on the market, or mainline even more of that sweet Monster Rancher crank, I can't recommend Monster Rancher Battle Card.  Pokemon may be part of an evil campaign to give Nintendo a death-grip on the brains of small children, and SvC isn't available on the legitimate market anymore, but I had more fun playing the both of them.  -- David Smith", "date": "Aug 3, 2000"}
