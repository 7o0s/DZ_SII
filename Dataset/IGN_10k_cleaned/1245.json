{"name": "Resident Evil: Survivor", "name_review": "Resident Evil Survivor", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/09/14/resident-evil-survivor", "text": "Whenever a great company such as Capcom creates a massive hit, be it Street Fighter, Mega Man, or let's say, Resident Evil, it's bound to make a mistake or take a wrong road once in a while. Well, Capcom has done a fantastic job up until now keeping the Resident Evil series clean and good. Up until Resident Evil Survivor, that is.   It's sort of like Capcom transformed into a meat processing company. Once it finished cutting off the ~fresh~ Resident Evil ~meat,~ it took the rest of the game, the waste, tendon, bone, cartilage, and whatever else (sphincter, spleen, eyeball, etc.) and fashioned a hot dog out of it. Resident Evil Survivor really is the remains of the series, just not the good parts.   Gameplay Survivor is a first-person perspective shooting game that takes players into a world not unlike Raccoon City, but a world altogether different. The premise is shown to you in the opening movie -- you've temporarily lost your memory, you have just crashed your helicopter in a strange place, and all you have is a single gun. From that point, during the rest of the game you get to piece together the Current Event puzzle to get to the bottom of things.   The story isn't half-bad, but don't make a mistake about it -- this is not the stuff that the other games are made of. Survivor takes place just after Resident Evil 3 (so Raccoon City is kaplooey), and it tells a whole new tale of how Umbrella continues to test its biohazard-style genetic experiments on the people from another small, no-name town. This one involves cutting open victims' brains while they are alive to get a certain seratonin or something with lots of syllables. Nice and gooey. I did eventually find out who ~Vincent~ was, and what happens, and the game actually creates an atmosphere and a need to find out what happened in the end. Cheesy as it was, I wanted to know what happens in the end.   What happens with Resident Evil Survivor is that none of the great production values of the first three went into this version. Instead of gorgeous prerendered backgrounds and amazing creature models and kooky but sometimes awesome puzzles, players get the dummy version. In fact, you could say that Survivor is the ~idiots~ version of the series. It's a weird hybrid light-gun/spook game with Resident Evil tension and fear, but without the light-gun.   On that note, Capcom decided not to include the light-gun for the American release of Resident Evil Survivor (It was compatible and recommended for the Japanese market). The reasons don't make too much sense if you're a foreigner, but if you live in the US and you watch the news, you know why Capcom didn't include a light gun. Personally, the absence of the gun didn't affect me at all. I didn't miss it one bit, in fact. The game functions entirely fine without a light-gun and the control scheme is simple enough, and the response time was good enough, so that the standard controller works perfectly without it. Some folks have complained about, but to me it was no big loss.   So yeah, I played all the way through the game and honestly, I have to admit, I was compelled to do so. Survivor, despite its cheap seduction as a Resident Evil game, isn't all cheap eats. The classic formula is all there. Even though I knew it was there and didn't want to buy into it, it still worked. The anticipation of big monsters coming and not having enough ammo; the desperate search for herb; the desperate search for more ammo; finding another clue and wanting to get the next one without realizing that two hours have passed. And all of it still cloaked the sounds of horror -- creaking, slow opening doors, lots of empty halls and rooms, wind through the doors, creepy music and far off groans.   Graphics Resident Evil suffers from the same troubles that old games such as Doom did back in 1994. The graphics, meaning the walls, backgrounds, and characters, are all decent looking from a distance, but being a first-person shooter, players can walk right up to a wall, and so they can see right into the edges of the pixels, too. And that's an ugly sight. The 3D environments aren't so bad on their own, but in contrast to the incredibly detailed artwork of Resident Evil 2 and 3, they're grainy, dull, and simplistic.   What's definitely, 100%, however, and will simply receive no defense, are the lamo-character models of every single monster, save perhaps the some zombies and the Lickers. Every other creature in this game is hideously dumbed down and simplistic. It's downright shameful. The tyrants look like tall suburban white guys in trench coats and flat tops, ~Blade,~ or whatever his name is, is so stripped of detail it's hard to differentiate him from another man. The character art, in a word, sucks.   Sound With Resident Evil, the sound, particularly the voice-acting, has always been borderline. It's always been campy, badly written and badly delivered. But somehow it was likeable, and in each version of the game, the voice acting improved, however slightly. In Survivor, 90% of the voice acting reverts to numbingly lame Resident Evil levels. Here, the lead character, who's name we believe to be ~Vincent,~ has a voice not unlike Keanu Reeves. Just think of the voices in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and then say the words, ~Who am I?~ And then you know exactly what the voice acting is like in this game.   The music and sound effects, however, is still spot-on. It's without a doubt the best aspect of the game. Like said earlier, the creepy sounds of wind, distant moans, and a background orchestra of synthesizers and horror sounds still does it do me. No one in their right mind should buy this game without knowing a few things: This is a campy, C-movie like formula rip-off of Resident Evil by the makers of Resident Evil. It's a strange hybrid of Resident Evil ~Survival Horror~ trimmings, without the best parts. And it's not for the smart. It doesn't require but the minimum of weapon management, and puzzle skills -- OK, there really are not at all -- and all you really need to know is to shoot a lot. Don't buy this, but if you must play everything Resident Evil, then buy it used, or rent it. It'll provide you with about four hours maximum of campy, brainless shooting kicks. Just don't blame me for feeling dirty afterward, because you will, oh yes, you will. (Another good analogy for Survivor -- it's like Kraft cheese slices or Cheese Whiz-- they're not actually real cheese, they're ~cheese products.~)", "date": "Sep 14, 2000"}
