Originally intended to debut as two entirely separate products here in America just as they were in Japan, Growlanser II: The Sense of Justice and Growlanser III: The Dual Darkness appeared to be in danger of never coming out here at all. Though popular in the Land of the Rising Sun (enough so to warrant the release of four different games in five years), this loose offshoot of the Langrisser series was met with so many delays during the local translation process that curious fans were worried that they'd never see it.But if the localization gurus at Working Designs have proven anything over the years, it's that they definitely always come through. As despite the numerous delays associated with previous RPG products like the Arc the Lad Collection, Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, and Lunar: Eternal Blue Complete, the games have always managed to eventually come out -- and 99% of the time have either met or exceeded fan expectations. Luckily for gamers eager to get their claws into Growlanser Generations, the wait was definitely worth it once again -- and for the third time this year, RPG fans will be treated to a little something different (Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne and Phantom Brave not withstanding)But that's what makes Growlanser Generations so interesting: the fact that it's that it's not your typical strategy/RPG. Instead it's more like a cross between Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter's movement system and Phantom Brave's progressive emphasis on troop placement. Though the game doesn't consist of traditional grid-based locations that characters must adhere to ala Ogre Battle or La Pucelle, it does stress the importance of using terrain and your ability to manage movement points, magic, and a defensive strategy simultaneously in just about every battle. Wein Cruz The cool thing is that, like Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, turns are constantly moving forward with a time bars dictating when a character can perform their actions. Im the meantime, all units move about the battlefield and position themselves for the best possible attack. It makes for an interesting system to say the least, and when coupled with occasional environmental hazards (such as hydraulic spike walls and the like) can be an awful lot of fun. Of course, since Growlanser Generations collects both The Sense of Justice and The Dual Darkness there are a couple of differences here and there.The Sense of JusticeGrowlanser II, for example, is a very structured and somewhat complex proposition. Outfitting your characters with individual weapons and special items like you would in your typical RPG isn't a concern here. Instead, it's replaced by what's known as the Ring Weapon System, which is essentially a customizable group of ability slots. But even when building your character there's a lot of strategy at play because there aren't any characters that can ever equip more than one ring and three power-ups at a time.Interestingly enough, you'll receive a whole host of rings in the aftermath of literally every battle you fight -- with the more difficult enemies slain earning you better and more elaborate versions. As you may have guessed, this means that every ring is different and most of them have Gem slots that can only support power-ups of a certain level. That's where the additional strategy comes in, as players must then decide which ring they should equip on what character, figure out how they can customize that ring most effectively, and how they can boost the most stats possible. Furthermore, a party can only carry a maximum of 50 rings at a time -- making it imperative to keep and discard the proper ring types on a regular basis. It makes for an extremely customizable party of adventurers that much is for sure, though admittedly, the ring swapping and babysitting can grow a bit tedious.    There's also a bit of tedium in the customization of each character's skill set. A separate category of techniques that can give players the ability to dash at their enemies, earn extra movement points, or defend against certain kinds of attacks, the Skill Upgrade system uses a Champions of Norrath-like modification tree to truly customize your alter egos. The problem is that there's rarely any need for most of the techniques you can learn and with charging periods that are almost comparable to that of magic sometimes feel a little forced. The more passive upgradeable skills, however, are great and with things like critical attack, poison tip, and the like, can make several of your characters deadly rather early.The magic system works a bit differently than your typical RPG game does as well. In a nod to the games of yesteryear, Growlanser II uses a nine-level spell charge system that can serve some pretty creative purposes during combat. Let's say, for instance, that you've charged a Fire spell all the way up to level nine. Once charged, you can then distribute that incantation in a number of ways: be it to attack nine different enemies with level-one campfires or nail one formidable foe with a single level-nine fireball. It's a neat idea for sure and the developers at Career Soft have even accounted for magic abusers by making it take a while to charge and individual spell -- you won't be casting level seven stone shots in five seconds, that's for sure; it just doesn't work that way.Final Fantasy X fans should take note that The Sense of Justice also uses a convenient point-to-point map system that gives players a pretty straightforward path to their destination. Town exploration, NPC conversations, and several story points are entirely text-based and do require a little backtracking in order to get everything. Even still, it's an efficient way to move things along and for those that don't like the treks associated with your typical RPG overworld traveling will probably be welcomed with open arms. Click For More Images As for the story itself, it's definitely the weaker of the two when compared to Growlanser III. But that doesn't mean that it isn't any good, it's just a little  clichd in the customary RPG sense. Your hero, Wein Cruz is on a quest to become an Imperial Knight, stop a mysterious force overtaking the land, and yadda yadda yadda. The characters are likeable, though, and despite some goofy voice acting and occasionally bizarre character portraits should keep most RPG fans interested. The branching choice-based storyline and kick ass soundtrack helps too.The Dual DarknessGrowlanser III is definitely the better presentational achievement between the two games, and offers a slightly more complicated battle system. All of the nuances and techniques of the combat mentioned above are in here too, mind you, but your battles are going to be a lot more difficult. The most obvious reason of which is because of the lowered number of playable characters in your party (which is halved from eight in Growlanser II to four in Growlanser II). The enemies are a little more aggressive and a little bit smarter as well, and some of the clever bottleneck tricks used to gain an advantage over an enemy in The Sense of Justice may not work as well here.To compensate for the few numbers, The Dual Darkness has beefed up your roster a bit. Players can still charge magic spells and learn techniques, but now they can team up and do joint incantations as well. These cooperative magic attacks are extremely important in the later goings and when paired with the ability to use items during battle (you couldn't do that in Growlanser II) help to change your combat strategies from the second game somewhat dramatically. In that regard it's kind of cool to be playing with what's essentially the same core battle system only to get a completely different experience out of it. And the challenge freaks who may not care for The Sense of Justice's moderate difficultly setting should be more pleased to know that Growlanser III is a little bit harder.    Of course, the most obvious difference between Sense and Darkness is the removal of the point-to-point map screen in favor of a more traditional overworld setup that allows you to travel to towns on foot in addition to the randomly generated dungeons. Unfortunately, these random dungeons do take away from the experience a bit as they just don't have the same flair that those in Growlanser II did. Sure they may be different every time in, but where's the fun in that if most of them play almost exactly the same?To the game's credit, the excellent battle system ultimately helps save Growlanser III in the long run, as does its much more interesting storyline. A prequel to Growlanser II, Growlanser III takes place a thousand years before the events of Sense of Justice and tells the story of an amnesiac hero who's thrust into the middle of a worldwide war that's brought about by a mysterious famine. Thankfully for us, the characters, their voice actors, and a neat little relationship system that powers a cleverly hidden branching storyline work together extremely well and it a whole lot more satisfying than that of Sense of Justice. Click For More Images It's a good thing that Growlanser Generations includes both The Sense of Justice and The Dual Darkness, as both games are individually weakened in opposite regards. So while Growlanser II may boast a superior combat system that allows for better battles, more interesting levels, and easier world navigation, Growlanser III counters it with a much better storyline, a tougher challenge, and a better overall presentation.Taken together, however, Growlanser Generations is great fun and can offer diehard role-players anywhere from 60-100 hours of entertainment. Even better is the fact that it maintains a rather unique feel when compared to the rest of the games in the genre and makes us wish that somebody somewhere will bring the first and fourth installments of Growlanser to our shores rather soon.
