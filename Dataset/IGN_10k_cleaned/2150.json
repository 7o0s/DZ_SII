The game is a project a programmer put together on the PC, cloning an already-established arcade and console game. You may have heard of it: Bust-a-Move. The reason why it's apparently so popular on the computer is simple: it's a free download of a clone of an excellent action-puzzler. Destination Software hopes to capitalize on this popularity by producing a version on the go, but the company may be in for a rude awakening when Ubi Soft releases a GBA version of the actual licensed game Snood rips off, one month after this game's debut... Features More than a hundred levels Multiple gameplay options Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  If you've played Taito's classic on any of the bazillion systems it was released on, then you know what Snood is all about: connect three or more like pieces together by shooting them from a cannon. When they link, they disappear...and any pieces hanging on for dear life will fall out of play. The task is to empty the ~bin~ of pieces from the game's round before they cross the foul line at the bottom of the screen. The Game Boy Advance version has a few variations of the game, including a classic Marathon-style mode, a Puzzle mode, a Time Attack, and the Journey where you'll go through the hundred puzzles in order until you lose all your continues. Snood is definitely a clone, but it's a pretty okay clone if you can put up with the overall ~shareware~ feel.  The game has been tweaked a bit beyond Bust-a-Move -- pieces aren't quite as ~sticky~ as they are in the ~official~ game...it's a lot easier to fill in gaps between other pieces since the engine is a little more forgiving.  But this game isn't going to win any awards in the graphics, sound, or game options categories, due to the game's quick-and-dirty conversion of the game. Snood tries to offer a bit of charm with goofy character faces that blink and stick their tongues out while the player moves through the levels, but they're pretty hideously drawn and very forgettable...there's a reason why this game is shareware, and it shows.   One of the biggest disappointments comes from the fact that you need two copies of the game to take advantage of the two player link -- there is absolutely no way that this game is so graphically intensive that it wasn't possible to take advantage of the Game Boy Advance's single cartridge downloadable link play. If the developers worked this into the design it would have scored a couple points in its favor. The lack of a battery is also one of the game's major shortcomings. Without the battery, the game doesn't have the ability to record your progress in any of the game modes, nor will it save the high scores you've earned. And the Game Boy Advance version doesn't even feature one of the Shareware versions more popular modes: level creation.  As well as Snood plays on the Game Boy Advance, you simply cannot argue the fact that the game is a complete rip-off of the classic Bust-a-Move...and unfortunately nothing was done to make it its own series on the Game Boy Advance, other than the goofy faces blinking at you while playing.  I found it very funny to see that Destination Software actually ignores this fact and even plasters ~There is nothing in the world quite like SNOOD!~ on the back of the box. Snood is basic fun, but in all honesty I want to play the real deal...especially when it hits the GBA system at the same pricetag.", "date": "Oct 4, 2001"}
