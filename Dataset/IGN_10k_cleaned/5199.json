Developed by Scotland-based DMA Design, the unique mix between shooter and adventure game originally started out as a Nintendo project. For reasons unknown, Nintendo eventually decided not to publish the game and Midway picked up the rights. Good move, Midway. Despite all the development delays and the so-so graphics, Body Harvest is an excellent title that no sci-fi fan should be without.GameplayBody Harvest's plot is reminiscent of classic science fiction movies, such as Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the more recent Independence Day. The premise is that the human race is the perfect food for a race of nasty space bugs, and that we were planted on Earth by these aliens thousands of years ago. Now the cosmic farmers have returned, arriving at different points in history to reap what they've sown. By 2016 AD, when Body Harvest commences, there is hardly anyone left to devour. In the meantime, a small band of scientists aboard a space station is planning to send genetically engineered soldiers back in time to take out the insect threat. But the station is attacked and only one soldier manages to get out alive. Our hero travels back in time and starts to liberate Earth from the invasion.The gameplay is a cool mixture of action, shooting, driving and some minor roleplaying elements. Players explore different time periods and locales (Greece 1916, Java 1941, America 1966, Siberia 1991, Alien Homeworld 2046), talk to the residents and jump into any vehicle they can find. See an old German WWII tank parked in an abandoned military installation? Jump inside and kick some alien butt. The ultimate objective is always the same: Protect the inhabitants from being munched on by giant insect aliens. You can run, drive cars, tanks and boats, fly planes and helicopters, collect guns, ammo, fuel and health powerups, and most importantly, aim and shoot. But in order to access new areas, players have to solve some simple puzzles and fulfill objectives like saving a burning village with a fire truck, solving the mystery of an ancient statue or finding parts for a broken swamp boat. The more than 60 different vehicles add a lot of variety and give gamers something to look forward when discovering a new town or military depot.Like the game's programmers, Scottish-based DMA Design, the alien predators in Body Harvest are an interesting bunch, to say the least. At the beginning of each harvesting wave, the aliens beam down from the sky (the sky turns black momentarily to signify the start of a wave). A giant harvester spider will sit around with its eyes closed and send out little jelly guys to go collect humans for it to eat. Since humans have the annoying habit of hiding in buildings, air-borne dragonflies bombard the houses to let the jellies in. Drake's best strategy is to take out the fliers first, then the jellies, then wake up the nasty spider guys and blow them to green splattering bits using one of many weapons. But the best moments in the game still come from the fact that you can examine virtually everything. Walk up to a torch and press A and you will extinguish it, dimming the light. Walk up to another torch and press your A-Button, and... Whoops. It's a switch opening a hidden door in the wall. Touches like these make Body Harvest an involving and deep adventure that will reward anyone who is willing to stick with it.More than actually providing a real challenge for the player to overcome, Body Harvest's puzzles are mainly there to draw the player into the story and create the right mood for the game. Let's face it, pulling a switch in a house to lower a drawbridge isn't rocket science, but it does take away from the shooting and driving and breaks up the action to let players catch their breath. It also helps to maintain the slightly eerie atmosphere that permeates every inch of the world in Body Harvest, making the whole experience all the more unique. Wait till you see some of DMA's wilder ideas, such as the zombie problem in the America stage...Controls are simple. Targeting and vehicle control should be a cinch for anyone who has ever played a shooter or a driving game, but the game runs a little too slow at times. With multiple enemies on screen, there is visible slowdown which causes the controls to be less responsive than they should be. Targeting can also be confusing when standing close to objects that obstruct your view, or trying to track far away enemies, but with a little bit of practice, most gamers will overcome these annoyances. Because of the immense freedom and sprawling environments, there are also a few bugs, such as strange collision detection and clipping, but all these flaws don't distract from the riveting gameplay all that much. It's hard not to smile every time you discover a big, fat tank, or take to the air in one of the game's numerous airplanes. A cool concept, no matter what the execution.GraphicsWhile DMA manages to set the stage with impressive level designs, huge explosions, some subtle realtime lighting effects and cool vehicle graphics, the low framerates and foggy horizons clearly date Body Harvest as a first-generation game. The graphics aren't necessarily bad, but the slowness and the slightly jumpy camera do get in the way. And there is no way around it: The design of the hero and some of the enemies is just too cheesy. Body Harvest's hero, Adam, might consider slipping into something less conspicuous than an orange Orkin-Man suit. Thankfully, the involved quest, sometimes frightening action, and outstanding sound and music more than make up for the lacking visuals.SoundDMA has one of the biggest sound departments in Europe -- and it shows. The interactive (dynamic) score in Body Harvest quietly hums along with a deep carpet of string sounds and some subdued piano notes once in a while. Body Harvest is one of those rare games where the music perfectly fits to the action and creates the desired atmosphere. Although the intro theme isn't all that hot (it sounds a lot like Metroid, actually), the music that plays during the map screen is excellent.Data ManagementMidway finally did what it should have done a long time ago -- support cartridge back-up. You don't need a memory pak to save your game, eliminating Rumble Pak swapping. Good job.I really wish more developers tried to deliver truly original stuff, like DMA Design. Body Harvest is a much needed breath of fresh air in a stale genre. There is so much originality here (British gamers will get a kick out of all the in-jokes, like ~Trumptonas Town~), that it's really a shame that the graphics aren't quite on par. Too bad there isn't a multiplayer mode, either. With all these vehicles, it would have added much more replay value. If you can't take some slow framerates and some cheesy character designs, give this game a rent first. Everyone else: I enjoyed every minute playing it and whole-heartedly recommend this game. Crank up the music and turn down the lights -- and let the harvest begin.", "date": "Oct 23, 1998"}
