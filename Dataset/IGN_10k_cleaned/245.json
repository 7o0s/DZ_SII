Personally, I've been a fan ever since Ray swung himself a starring role as Jesus Shuttlesworth in Spike Lee's 1998 love sonnet to basketball, He Got Game. Basically salvaging a sub-par script with incredible displays of basketball agility and ability, Allen showed the world he could take on more roles than just the solid, maturing shooting guard he is for seven months out of the year for the Bucks. The pickup game at the beginning of the film between Shuttlesworth's fictitious Lincoln High School all-stars and a group of playground players is absolutely awesome  rewind that and watch it again, and you'll agree with me. That scene alone was enough to make Spike's hoops joint a regular in my Blockbuster rotation.  Ray Allen got skills.    So now, in an era when shoe contracts for NBA players are like, so 1994, Allen pushes the endorsement envelope ever further by starring in Microsoft's latest basketball game for the PC, NBA Inside Drive 2000.  Obviously, image-conscious Microsoft recognized Allen as one of the (equally as image-conscious) NBA's ~good guys,~ and pronounced him their cover model. ~Hundreds of NBA moves motion-captured by Ray Allen of the Milwaukee Bucks,~ trumpets the boxcover.   So if Microsoft, by embracing this technology, graced every player in NBA Inside Drive 2000 with Allen's patented fluid moves, I was betting that this would be a pretty interesting game.  I sat down to my PC and slid in the CD to see just what Inside Drive 2000 was all about.  I must admit to slight consternation  I had nothing on hand like the state-of-the-art, game-annihilating joysticks, controllers and hardware of my IGN brethren down the hall, who I've watched attack video games with great vehemence. I was armed only with my humble mouse, and a desire to see if Indiana's vertically challenged Chris Mullin could dunk in this game (he can't). Yet, I clicked onward, leaving the serious hardware to my counterparts and pronouncing myself old-school, a virtual soul-surfer of sorts.   The feature I appreciated right off the bat about ID2000 was the wide range of game options at my fingertips, for various levels of skill.  The Start-Up screen asks if you would like to play a Single Game, continue with Season Play, skip to the Playoffs, play Tonight's Game, or shoot around in Practice (interestingly, practice is held on a blacktop playground court in the shadow of a nameless arena).  Single Game is pretty self-explanatory: pick two teams, select the one you wish to control, review and tweak your lineup, and hit the floor. Season Play allows you to manage a team throughout a virtual NBA season, and the ID2000 will keep track of stats and standings for you. If you don't feel like playing a full 82-game season, you can arrange to simulate the results of any number of games automatically. ~At season's end,~ reads the game manual, ~NBA Inside Guide 2000 automatically moves your team to the playoffs  if you make the cut.~ Hmm. And I guess if you get halfway through your fantasy season only to realize you don't like the results, you could always just stage a labor strike.    ~Tonight's Game~ is a pretty cool function. If you are playing ID2000 on any date that the real NBA is in session, the game allows one or two players to play any of that night's games. I clicked on Tonight's Game for September 10th, half-expecting somehow to be presented with a full suite of contest to pick from, but no  ID2000 was on-point, recognizing, merely through installation on my PC, that the NBA season does not convene until November. The choice was up to me.  Microsoft does a nice job of presenting a slick package. Upon activating the game, a video-enhanced highlight reel of dunks, alley-oops and finger-wagging fills the screen, starring some very recognizable faces of the NBA. The music, a pretty mainstream drum-n-bass loop, purportedly comes from Spearhead, tho' I heard little of that group's reggae influences in the track. Still, I was excited  this was the new thing, right? The graphics I saw in the intro led me to believe this would be as good as sitting courtside next to Spike Lee himself.  Unfortunately, that's the biggest problem with this game  and on a larger scale, game marketing on a whole. The packaging promises something I've yet to really see delivered.  It's quite obvious that ID2000's developers worked hard to simulate the fluid moves of a live basketball player, but in my opinion, motion-capturing is still a long way from perfect.  So much talk of the enhancements, duplicating ~the speed, power, and energy of the NBA,~ but when you strip away the marketing promises and start the clock, the exaggerations on ID2000's boxcover are quickly apparent.    Let me say, the graphics ARE impressive  before you start to actually play. When I clicked ~Start,~ I was whisked away to Madison Square Garden, courtesy of a swooping bird's eye camera view that encircles each team and provides a beautiful view of the cheering, packed house before alighting at mid-court for the opening tip. You can bypass the team introductions if you want, but I kind of liked hearing my beloved New York Knicks introduced by the charismatic arena announcer to the cheers of the hometown crowd.  I selected the Houston Rockets as my opponent in this particular game, and yes, there was Scottie Pippen, and Sir Charles, and Hakeem the Dream  I was psyched. There are several camera angles that you can choose from to view the action on the court, so many in fact that any veteran NBA cameraman would be hard pressed to duplicate each one without falling onto the court.  But the players themselves are largely faceless  there was some attempt made to give Latrell Sprewell his trademark cornrows and goatee, but as far as Patrick Ewing goes...well, we all agree that we'd recognize Pat's face in any crowd, but were it not for his number 33, I wouldn't have known which big man to feed the ball to in the paint.    From the tip-off, I was immediately challenged. On offense, the player with the ball is highlighted in green, and as I mouse-maneuvered point guard Charlie Ward up the court with the ball, a green blob moved along ahead of us.  My goal was to place the blob where I wanted Charlie to go (and he would follow), but at the same time evade Houston's advancing defense.  We encountered no resistance until we passed half-court, but soon my blob was lost in a sea of jumbled jerseys, players jockeying for position around the arc.  After working out a few kinks I figured out how to pass the ball around, but setting up an offense proved difficult, and with the 24-second clock ticking I often found myself shooting from the key as soon as I got a good look, or else driving errantly to the basket for a lay-up. Charlie Ward was my leading scorer by the end of the first half, and any true Knick fan knows that isn't a good thing.  Passing proved to be maddeningly difficult due to the lack of control I had on placing all of my players in an effective offensive set.  Perhaps this comes with weeks of learning how to simultaneously click and hit the correct keys on the keyboard, but this is supposed to be fun, right?  After all, I was really supposed to be working, not playing a game.  When Houston had the ball, I held my own on defense, but simultaneously discovered the most frustrating feature of ID2000.  My simulated opponent moved the ball around so fast among its players, it took me a while to figure out how to keep up by switching defenders, but I got it. When you are playing man-to-man, right click switches defenders, while holding down the left click raises your defender's hands to block the shooter with the ball. Fine, except if you manage to rebound a missed shot or a block, don't forget to let go of the left click as soon as you come down with the ball.  You're on offense now, where the left click button controls your player's shot. I can't tell you how many times I came down with a sweet rebound, only to release a bush league full-court prayer by accident because I didn't let go quickly enough and allow my player to reset. As if that weren't enough, the announcers (NBA personalities Kevin Calabro and Marques Johnson) make you feel like dirt for your clickable faux pas. ~You gotta be patient on offense if you're gonna score on turnovers.~ ~That's a wasted opportunity.~ Shut up. I know. Don't yell at me.  How can you get the good stuff out of ID2000? First off, I'd recommend strongly playing this game with a gamepad.  Don't be like me and think you can soar to your fullest potential on a break at work with your mouse. And in my opinion, this is not a basketball game that the novice player will immediately enjoy. From the intricate commands necessary to set picks and play defense, to the attractive ability of this game to store stats and standings on your machine, ID2000 is geared towards the seasoned sports gamer.  That said, it could use a tutorial.  Hey, I'm a big sports fan, and I held this game to a high standard, perhaps due to everything that the website, the packaging, and the introduction promised to me. For all my griping, this is a cool game, and the thought that went into it definitely shows. Not only that, the game boasts a $29.99 price tag that makes up for a lot of faults in an era of $60 plus titles sitting on every game store shelf. Occasionally, you do something just right, get a man open, and you will get a replay-worthy bucket.  I would be lying if I said I wasn't pumped when I scored two on a Marcus Camby sky-slam.  But as for motion-captured realism, I'm still holding out; as for watching scripted Ray Allen moves, I'd still rather rent the video.  -- Mark Haggarty", "date": "Sep 22, 1999"}
