Not only was it my gateway game to the wonderful world of economic simulations (I'm serious) and the joy of strategy and planning they can bring, but it was also among the best of the genre for the simple fact that it had personality and involved something that I absolutely love. Roller coasters are a blast. They're fun to ride and they're fun to watch. It must be pretty nice for these real theme park owners to be able to sit back and watch people have fun in their park and empty their pockets while doing so. While the development team has changed from Chris Sawyer and co. to Frontier development, it's pretty obvious that the new team was pretty dedicated to keeping the feel and personality intact while wanting to move the series forward in a few areas. The new 3D engine allows for a lot of improvements including easier construction and being able to ride the coasters. New features like VIPs, an improved career mode, and sandbox mode also help make the game more than it was. The problem is that I've encountered a slew of bugs and the game ships out of the box with a couple of deficiencies that while they don't completely detract from my excitement and addiction, are impossible for me to completely overlook.   The one thing this series desperately needed was a facelift. Not only for the pure fun of seeing these coasters and theme parks in full 3D, but for the functionality of being able to see your park from all sides. Of course, the fun part is what's most noticeable to shallow people like me. Colors are bright, coasters look fantastic, and the peeps, for how low detail they are, look great and have good personality regardless of their poly count. More impressive is the sheer amount of peeps that can visit your park at the same time. Thousands of the little buggers can run around and have fun. With the variety of shapes and clothes for them to wear, it make the park come alive.   All of the themes of the game are also done particularly well. The Spooky theme is probably the most complete and my favorite at this point. There are some great little animatronics, plants, lamps, etc. that all fit in well with each of the themes and add a lot of style to a park.   The addition of a day/night cycle only increases the beauty of the game. Lighting is pulled off in a grand way so the transition will be a totally pleasant one. It won't hamper construction or building as the gamma is cranked up while building at night and the cursor will have a light stamp of its own when not building.     Extra effects, like the awesome water reflections and bloom lighting, are also available for those that have the power and sliders help regulate the detail for those with lesser computers. And those with lesser computers will probably not be able to run this game well at full detail. After your parks start getting full of rides and people, the frame rate has the tendency to drop. Oddly enough, it drops even more when the game is paused for building.   Without changing the construction process at all, the addition of a 3D camera makes building coasters much easier. The free-camera allows for full range of vision giving much needed angles of view that just weren't possible with the 2D isometric visuals of the first two RCT games. It's still not a perfect process, but I've had much less problem constructing interesting pretzel-like rides.   Interestingly, while the transformation to 3D, while almost completely agreeable to me, did mean that underground construction had to be eliminated, probably because of all of the different possibilities of entry and exit from the ground. In any case, I loved building coasters underground (especially mine train coasters) in the past and that isn't possible anymore. It is possible to simulate that experience by constructing structures for the coaster to run through, as I have tried to do. It's certainly possible to create some interesting coasters and creations that way, but it's definitely a lot more work. Thankfully, if you want to create ditches for your coasters to move through, you can actually raise the landscape around coaster tracks easily. You can even simply cover those ditches with a roof or paths to quickly create the feel of a tunnel.   For the most part, the game mechanics in general are a lot the same. Creating a theme park that serves all of its guests is the overall idea. For those that aren't familiar with the series or are unused to dealing with three dimensions in their games, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 includes an extensive tutorial library to help with nearly all aspects of the game. They're quite useful for reminding yourself of the various aspects and will have you up and running in no time.   Once familiar with the basics, exploring the different modes and tools in the game is easy as pie. The series didn't just undergo an facelift in-game, but also throughout the entire menu system and interface. It adopted a much slicker system that is nice to look and provides all of the information necessary efficiently.    Before playing the career mode, it's probably worth fooling around with the various tools that are available first as they could give you some insight into the greater plan of park creation. The peep designer allows players to create their own special families inside the game that can be followed. Basically, you'll be able to create groups that either have varied interests or have specific interests in order to see how various groups are going to enjoy your park. The group dynamic is actually a completely new invention for RCT. Instead of peeps running around by their lonesome, they travel in groups, as happens at real parks. Whether they're a couple of teenage sweethearts or a full family with different ages, it's fun to watch them travel the park. Those adults chaperoning little kids around will stand outside the kids rides patiently waiting for them while groups of teenagers will ravenously chew up any big coasters they find. The cool thing about designing your own peeps is that they'll run around the park taking pictures together at picture spots. These pictures will be automatically saved to your My Documents folder and will enter the rotation of screens being shown in the menu screen. It's a nifty little feature that doesn't make too much difference to actual gameplay, but is fun nonetheless.   The tool sets also include a building designer and coaster designer. Both of these drop you into a flat environment with unlimited money and all of the parts to build any kind of coaster and any kind of scenery, of which there are a ton of each. These constructions can then be saved for later use in a future theme park.   While these modes aren't necessarily brilliant on their own, they are a great place to put together some really great rides of all shapes and sizes without the interference of building inside strange terrain. The process can even be quickened with the great new automatic coaster completion feature. There are some things to think about while doing this, such as you can't tell how expensive the final coaster will be on a flat surface. You'll have to figure that out in the actual game. It's also worth considering that you'll need to build coasters around objects already in the park, especially in scenarios, so in some cases it's actually better to build inside a park rather than import a coaster. One final note about the coasters is the awesome option to import your coasters from RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 and 2 into 3. Finally you'll be able to see your favorite creations of years past in 3D and be able to ride them. Unfortunately, this only works if you've actually saved them.   The last tool is the scenario editor. Much of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is a lot of work and a lot of planning. Such is the case with the scenario editor if you really want to give others something unique to use. Lucky for all of you lazy people out there, it's easy to see that there are plenty of people willing to do the work for you to create some fun and creative scenarios. Judging by the first two games, the community for this third part of the series will be large and active.     Along with the tools are four modes of play: tutorial, career, sandbox, and custom scenario. We've gone over the tutorial and custom scenarios so I'll skip over those and say quickly that I've very happy that a true sandbox mode has been added for quick and easy loading. Sandbox gives you a large map and unlimited money with all rides, scenery, shops, and paths available for use immediately. It's a great place to create that super park you've always wanted without the pressure of time limits, money, or customer satisfaction.   The career mode is the main portion of the gameplay and is set up a bit differently than it has been in the past. Each scenario now has three goal sets of increasing difficulty. Beating the Apprentice level of difficulty on each of the scenarios unlocked initially will unlock a new scenario down the list. Beating Entrepreneur and Tycoon in all levels will unlock the last two scenarios.   As I mentioned before, the gameplay of RCT3 is much the same as it was in previous games. Start small, make money, and grow your park into a thriving Mecca of laughter and love. Add different coasters for different types of people, including new junior rides for kids, make sure that your peeps are fed and happy, have access to bathrooms, money and the rest and you'll do well. At least it seems like it would be that easy.   Unfortunately, as of release, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 left out one feature that I consider very important. It was apparently considered less important because of focus groups, but is something that I've had a hard time being completely successful without. Basically, there is no overall list of peep reactions to the park to sort through as there was in 1 and 2. Therefore, you don't know what the majority of the park is thinking. All you have is park rating calculated using a complex equation to go by. So when no one, and I mean no one, is riding any of your rides, which should appeal to the entire spectrum, you won't be able to figure out why, unless you click on each of the peeps individually. You can see what people thought about the rides, but half the time, they aren't thinking anything about them, they're just walking by. I remember from the original RCT having lines all over the place. It seems a lot harder to keep a queue filled this time around. When you have nothing to advise you on why this is happening, it can get pretty damn frustrating. The first update will apparently fix this, but for those of you that only have the Internet at work, this is going to be a frustration that you'll have to find a way to fix on your own.    That said, Frontier has made some of the park management a bit easier, including setting paths for workers. It's done in a paint style instead of the gigantic stamp of old. It's way easier to be more precise this time around and will allow you to create more complex patterns of coverage. The only problem is that paths set for other workers of the same type don't display anywhere when you're placing a new path... which would have been helpful.   Another nice feature are the ghost coaster cars. You can test a coaster out when building it at any point in order to make sure that what you've built so far works up to the point you've created. This helps lessen the disaster of finishing a coaster only to find out that it can't get through the very first loop. You'll still have to test the coaster with actual cars in order to get the ratings, but those ghosts really help the process.   VIPeeps are also a new and enjoyable feature. These special people have different wants that need to be fulfilled and can really make a difference to the way people view your park. Setting up a tour for them is pretty easy. Just add destination points and then sort the order of visitation.   In fact, the entire interface is pretty well organized. It's kept to small buttons on the left side of the screen that eventually open up windows, most of which are kept in the bottom right corner of the screen. Bigger graphs and finance windows will display larger, but can be moved around as well.   I'm sure there are some more little tweaks I'm missing, but the last big addition that's that I must mention, something I think everyone will enjoy quite a bit, is fireworks. It's easy, if a bit time consuming like the rest of the game, to create an interesting and fun fireworks show that peeps will love. You can place fireworks anywhere around the park and tie each of them to a mixing program so that you can time a show to music. It's simple and fun, especially when you begin importing your own music into RCT3.     Sadly, I've experienced quite a few bugs during my time with the game. I've crashed to the desktop a good five or six times, had the camera freeze on me, seen repairmen and janitors stuck on railings, and experienced a lot of graphical glitches, most of which happen when adjusting the landscapes. My drivers are updated on both of the computers I've been playing it on as well. Both of them happen to have Nvidia cards which could be the problem given the ATi logo at the front end of the game.   Again, I've been informed that an update will be available ~when the game comes out.~ I put that in quotes because Atari US's street date is November 2nd, but the game is already out in stores around the Bay Area at least, probably in plenty of places around the country as well, so I'm not entirely sure when that will be, all I know is that it isn't right now.Yeah, there are some bugs and problems with RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. Were they enough to stop my fun? Not really. They certainly can be frustrating at times. It's not particularly nice feeling helpless when none of your rides have any peeps in line and you have no idea why.But when it comes to the creative aspect of the game, it's hard to find much fault. RCT3 will allow players to really get down and dirty and create some spectacular parks with a level of detail they're sure to love. The series has only gained in personality with the switch to 3D and the engine renders environments and rides beautifully.If you were a fan of the original games, you'll love this one. If you never played the originals and like theme parks, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try, at least in demo format. This is an addictive game with a great playful and positive premise, something you don't usually find in games these days. I just wish the developers had been allowed a little more time to iron out the last few wrinkles.", "date": "Oct 28, 2004"}
