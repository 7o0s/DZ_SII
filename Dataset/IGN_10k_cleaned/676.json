I always thought that the intracacies of the pasttime just couldn't be simulated well enough with a mouse or keyboard interface.  Even since the advent of cue-like controllers designed to alleviate that deficiency, few billiards titles to date have had the accurate physics modeling and other features necessary to make the sport truly worth playing on a home computer.  Thankfully, the folks at Celeris have beaten the odds and offered forth something that is not only enjoyable and very realistic, but also quite informative for those out there aspiring to be the next Jack White or Minnesota Fats.  Virtual Pool Hall starts out looking simple enough.  Players chalking up for the first time will be greeted by a fresh rack of Nine Ball and no pesky opponents to gum up the works.  Those comfortable with that setting can of course stick with it and go on their merry way.  However, for those who want a little more variety, the truckload of options and game variations should suit you just fine.  Just about every type of two player pool match in existance is represented in the title's game selection interface, from common games like Straight Pool and Eight Ball to more exotic, less known ones such as Cribbage, Honolulu, and Bowlliards.  Chances are that every game you've played in life is available here, and there will be several that'll have you scratching your head.  For you ladies and gents who feel like brushing up on your skills a bit, a trip through the full-motion video tutorials with legendary shooter Mike Sigel may be just the thing to help you on your way to losing fewer games and buying far less rounds at your local pub.    Even more helpful in these instructional videos is the option to pause the action and take a crack at the shot being displayed using the actual game interface.  It's not quite as handy as having an actual pool table in front of you to make the attempt, but it runs a close second.  Those who have been depressed by the wholly disappointing physics engines of many other pool games will be gratified to know that Virtual Pool Hall seems to have this formal problem licked.  I've never come across a model as accurate as that which is used in this title, and pool fans would be well served to check it out for themselves.  English, surface friction, rail cushioning, and just about everything else that affects a standard shot is taken into account, and is done so with startling precision.  After choosing the angle for a shot (done simply by moving the mouse), players hold down the 'S' key (for stroke) and pull back the mouse causing the onscreen cue to do the same.  Finally, the shot is taken by thrusting the mouse forward again at whatever speed you deem to be appropriate for the attempt at hand.  Though this method seems a bit awkward, and admittedly is such at first, it is quickly absorbed and ultimately serves as the most realistic method for stroking the cue ball short of having one of those handy dandy cue-like controllers.  Now, as anyone who has actually played pool knows, hitting the ball isn't really all that hard.  Hitting the ball and making it do what you want it to do is the challenging part.  Once again, the folks at Celeris help to take the guesswork out of this one by providing the option to show the expected travels paths the balls will roll for every given shot you line yourself up to take.  I found that this particular feature was not quite as accurate as it could be following the first couple of ball or rail impacts.  However, since the game doesn't know how hard you're going to hit the ball, and that certainly would make a difference in how the balls traveled, it can't really be perfect.  Also, if you're considering playing an opponent, computer or otherwise, with this option engaged, think again.  It's available only when you are practicing by yourself, so all of you players who like to move the balls around when your opponent isn't looking, or take that quick second thrust at the cue ball after accidentally giving it a tap are just going to have to settle for playing by the rules this time.  As far as eye candy is concerned, the title's use of 3D acceleration makes for some impressive visuals that should leave little in the way of whining.  The table is believable from any angle and from any level of zoom selected.  In fact, the fluidity of the zoom feature and the beauty of the game when you're up close and personal is simply shocking.  On several occasions, I found myself losing matches since my desire to see the ant's perspective on things superceded my notions of making accurate shots.  It was a little disheartening to lose to computer opponents with names like ~Ms. Offen~, but oh well.  On an even more entertaining note is the music of choice for this particular pool hall.  To even sample these rather interesting tracks you'll have to go hunting in the preferences menu at the top of the screen, but trust me, it's worth the trouble.  I'm not entirely certain where they dug up some of these musical acts, but who cares, it's a riot to listen to these things.  One of the tunes is a bit country-oriented, but lends its lyrics to making fun of politicians and their inability to spend our money with any sense of reason.  I guess the developers thought there wouldn't be a problem with using the game as a forum for their political views.  Hey, I didn't mind, it was hysterical.  Another little ditty is a rock theme called ~Black Ball~ which does an outstanding job of getting listeners all riled up about the wonderfully fantastic world of Eight Ball.  Though a couple of the other selections seem like they were taken directly from the swelling legions of musical scores served up in customer service telephone queues, most will be catchy enough to stick in your head for awhile after hanging up your cue.  Basically, Virtual Pool Hall has everything you've been looking for in a PC billiards simulation.  The top-notch graphics, tournaments, challenging computer opponents, hordes of options, and multiplayer capabilities of this offering should be enough to satiate even the most hardened of pool game pessimists.  Furthermore, the instructional videos and exuberant music lace a little sugar on top of this treat, making it even more deserving to be on your own personal menu.  Pool enthusiasts, bar room players, and even you guys out there who've found yourselves watching cable TV Nine Ball tournaments would be well served to give this one a shot.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "Feb 2, 2000"}
