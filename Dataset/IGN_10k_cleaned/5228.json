And rightly so, since it rocked the house with its slick blend of a highly philosophical cyberpunk storyline with some of the coolest visuals ever put into an anime. Nine years later we have a game that shares the same name as the TV version that came out a couple of years ago, but something happened in the wash. While the world in Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is still here, and there is a decent plot buried in the geekspeak, the basic game is an action game with lots of guns and a few cool ideas that still aren't enough to bring it up above an average shooter.   The world of Ghost in the Shell takes place in the year 2029 in Japan and the idea of a soul is a pretty nebulous thing. Humans can have their brains wiped and replaced with new memories or even become ~puppets,~ people who are completely controlled by someone else. The puppet masters can be other humans who hijacked their brains or even sentient AI that have left their origins and expand their control through the Internet.   In this world there are two main characters: Major Motoko Kusanagi and Bateau. Both of them work for Section 9, a secret intelligence agency. Kusanagi gets the most amount of screen time and it's pretty easy to see why. She's the sex appeal here even if her body is artificial and she has the acrobatic skills to get through the jumping puzzles in the game. Bateau is no slouch himself, but his missions tend to be more of the run and gun side.   In the action scenarios themselves the game runs very smoothly with plenty of gunplay and explosives to make everything perfectly violent in the future. A tricky part of the game is the control itself which focuses on the analog sticks and the shoulder buttons. The left and right sticks are for movement and the camera, respectively, while the L1 button is for the primary weapon and L2 is for the secondary. R1 and R2 are for holding on to a ledge and jumping. The face buttons are for the secondary tasks of reloading, activating terminals, and swapping weapons.    These controls are tricky and playing for the first hour or so is like figuring out a Rubik's Cube at the same time as a regular game, but it does make sense after a while. With the exception of the reloading pretty much everything that's needed in the regular game can be handled with both thumbs always on the analog sticks. It's good because there is a constant need for running and moving the camera and shooting all at the same time.    This action is the core of the game and it's done well even if there isn't a whole lot of variety in the action itself. The guards have different weapons and different amounts of armor, but they all still act the same. One minor complaint is that the AI is a bit awkward since there will be lots of times that the character is visible and even running into the enemies, but they don't get activated until there's a gunshot.   To make the game more interesting there are a few areas that require some careful navigating and anyone who's familiar with Tomb Raider should know what to expect. There are plenty of narrow ledges to hold onto, big jumps to make, and a few aerial tricks. This can work well with many set pieces that create a sense of vertigo, but it can also be frustrating in that some areas require a triple combo of jumps and wall jumps to get to a new ledge. The real strength is in the combat which holds well enough on its own.   Overall, the feeling here is of a game that is done in a funky anime style, but aside from that there's not too much to go through. The missions themselves can be done in five to six hours the first time through and that's a little too short, especially since the last boss fight is visually impressive, but really quite easy to defeat. With more length and more variety this game could have gone from being a decent third-person shooter to something truly special.     Still, with a pedigree of a world like Ghost in the Shell, Stand Alone Complex needed to have more than just action. It's certainly well-done in the art of creating a world with humans and robots to fight, but the extra touches that get thrown in to make the game a Ghost in the Shell game feel more like a flavor packet than some homemade sauce.   Since computer hacking is such a vital part of the franchise it's in here, too, but done in a style that treats computers in such a bizarre way. Much of the game involves computer terminals that are scattered about everywhere. They'll be in doorways inside, out in the open, even in a military training ground's shooting range. Instead of involving the player in hacking the system these are essentially just waypoints the either cue up another piece of the storyline or just open up a door. All of the intrigue comes from the near incessant dialogue that keeps on coming over the communications line. Actual involvement in the story is pretty minimal which is disappointing.   For the most part, the strategy of the game is very linear with a very straightforward approach to getting through the missions themselves. The one big change is the ability to hack into the human guards. Taking down the commander and stealing the ID code from him will indicate the rest of the men in his squad with yellow triangles which is useful for knowing if the area is safe or filled with enemies.    Sometimes, and there's really no reason why, there will be enemies who are represented with blue triangles. These can be hacked into from afar and doing this requires a quick mini-game of matching up spinning circles and tapping the X button. At first this starts out like a quick formality since matching up the first circle is easy. Getting the enemies who have three circles is trickier since the third circle spins so fast that it boils down to luck. But it doesn't really matter too much since it's possible to just try and try again until it's hit.    While these blue triangle moments come in handy for a few different scenarios such as one where a sniper can be controlled to take out other snipers, they don't really complete the world. In Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy there was a complete feeling of being able to do whatever, whenever with the powers currently available. In Stand Alone Complex this amounts to little extra flourishes on a straightforward game. While the whole game looks like Ghost in the Shell it's still lacking some of the feel.   As an extra bonus there is a multiplayer mode, but this is also extremely straightforward as well. Two to four people can do a death match or pair up for teams and that's about it. The levels themselves are large and can feel a little roomy with four people and absolutely gigantic with two. While playing with two players I often had to coordinate with Tom ~World of Tomcraft~ McNamara to meet up so that we could actually fight. When the action is on it's pretty good, but having huge maps is not really the best way to go.What really keeps Stand Alone Complex together is that it does an amazing job of presenting a game that follows the look of the source material. The biggest drawback is that the feel of the same Ghost in the Shell movie is lacking in that much of the action is very similar and straightforward with a minimal nod to the hacking and computer work. Fans of the movie will be happy to get another look into the same world since the plot fleshes out the universe a little further and action fans should be satisfied, but the game could have still been a lot more and that's the most disappointing aspect.What is here is a well-done action game that has a distinct style and some strong graphics. The sound design is also nicely in place and it adds up to a good looking game. It's just that the overall experience comes up short and only gives a tease of giving players more of an active role in the story itself.", "date": "Nov 6, 2004"}
