Then I played Professor Layton and now I have a receding hairline, a beer gut like an inflatable inner-tube and I'm clearly as thick as an undercooked meat loaf. Damn you, Professor Layton. Damn you, Level-5.    I don't care that you crafted an excellent and entertaining adventure game; I don't care that it kept me playing long after my eyes got sore and my thumbs developed a dull but persistent ache  damn you for making me feel mentally inadequate. That's where I'm sitting right now. Here's a game that takes one of my favourite nearly-dead genres, the 'point and click adventure game' and blends it with the perennially popular Brain Training mini-game formula. The result is a game that is refreshing, challenging and makes edutainment more palatable than it has been in a long time; since, oh, I don't know  'Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?' days, let's say.     With a hand-animated, watercolour aesthetic, Professor Layton's village of St. Mystere is striking to wander through. The tale, which on the surface is shallow but immediately takes a quirky turn into murder-mystery territory, is presented through anime cutscenes, fully voice-acted by throaty British people who inject a strange 'David Copperfield-esque' quality into every line.   The dialogue, aimed at that rich, nougatty under-12 market, is harmless  like an infantile Sir Arthur Conan Doyle tale. But you can't help but be charmed by the simplicity and innocence of it all. Honestly, it reminded me more of a Studio Ghibli release than a game release; the animation style is very reminiscent of this, but the softly-softly approach to mature themes is also on par with something like Spirited Away or Porco Rosso, rather than a game like Phoenix Wright  to which many comparisons could rightly be drawn.   Disappointingly, the anime cutscenes and voice acting are only sparingly doled out throughout the adventure. A more consistent approach would've been more impressive. But that's a small thing to hold against the game, so let's move on, shall we?   Presentation aside, the meat of the game plays out like a narrative-driven Brain Training. In order to progress, you talk to a cast of very oddball characters  town drunks, rich socialites, street kids and barmen among them  and each blocks your progress to a point, asking you to solve a riddle for their help.   Billy-Tim Shimshaw makes a cameo. Nice shades!  While any sane person might say, 'screw you, buddy', and press past them, the rules of this game world mean that you'll be solving some 130 puzzles of varying complexity and theme before the climax of the adventure. If you're no Joe-genius (as I sadly came to realise) or you're under the age of 12, you're probably picturing a game that you simply get stuck in at a certain point and you just cannot progress any farther. The forward-thinking team at Level-5 in Japan have taken this into consideration, building in a crafty hint system.   Throughout the game, hidden in many corners of the world, are hint coins; these allow you to purchase up to three hints of increasingly helpful content to ensure that you're never far from the right answer.   In some ways, making these tips so accessible is a problem if you have no self-control. Hint Tokens are much more plentiful than the game's manual and in-game help suggests. If you're the kind of fastidious player who likes to search every screen thoroughly for hidden puzzles and coins, you'll soon have dozens of each, and you'll never be short of enough coins to practically spell out the solution.    If you answer incorrectly on a puzzle, the game does penalise you slightly; you're docked the equivalent of achievement points. That might actually discourage players from using their noggins  instead, choosing to part ways with a few tokens to get themselves the answer. Similarly, some of the puzzles are multiple choice and can be solved through a process of elimination. It does cheapen the experience to have a hints system that does little to discourage you from using it.    And what are the kinds of puzzles you end up tackling? If you've ever taken a basic skills test or equivalent, you're tasked with all sorts of spatial puzzles (Which line is shortest? How many triangles? Who's the tallest?), geometry, mathematics, logic, lateral thinking and even a few that really do require a fair amount of pen-and-paper working out to complete. These are the core of the game when you boil it down, and there's thankfully no shortage of them.     Quirky side-quests are also nicely integrated into play. As you solve some of the game's more challenging puzzles, you'll occasionally receive a random mechanical part or scrap of an oil painting. While on the surface this is just another collect-em-all subtask, by assembling the parts, you'll get a small robotic dog; the painting unlocks a cool little bonus we won't spoil for you here. Finally, any hidden puzzles you missed or puzzles you couldn't solve are collected for you to try your hand at later on, and any puzzles you solve are immediately accessible for you to replay or show off to your parents and friends.   It's this kind of dedication to the satisfaction of the player's experience that sets Professor Layton apart from other games. There's a lot going on at any one time  investigations, collecting, solving, searching for hidden save coins  but it's all presented on menus designed for instant recognition. You'll never feel overwhelmed or that your hand is being held too much  which is also something that the game could've easily fallen victim to.   Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a wonderful game. It really is. If you're into your brain teasers, then this one will have you hooked. The inclusion of a narrative framework is a stroke of brilliance too  and the simple but pleasing presentation is perfect for all ages. The series is big in Japan  and that's usually a good measuring stick for a franchise on the move. As the first game in the series to reach the West, it makes me hungry for the sequel. If only my poor brain could measure up. To the library!", "date": "Apr 10, 2008"}
