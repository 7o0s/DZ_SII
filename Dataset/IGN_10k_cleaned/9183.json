The update offers more restaurant-themed ~plate-spinning~ antics, as Flo helps her friends maintain their sanity as the volume of customers visiting their respective eateries increases. Families, screaming babies, cellphone chatterers, bookworms, and upwardly mobile ladies crowd the booths. You must balance tasks like seating customers, taking orders, and clearing dishes as the lobby fills with impatient folks.   Just finding the rhythm to survive a shift is tough, but the game introduces a host of complications to keep you frosty. Tips are increased by stacking similar activities (collecting food orders, delivering meals, etc.) and seating customers in chairs that match the color of their duds. The more diners you slide into a bench that matches their pant suits, the more bonus tips you earn. You must also keep customers happy by plying them with snacks and drinks. Finally, you must also be mindful of the way certain customers react to each other. For example, bookworms freak if seated near a family with an unhappy baby or a dude on his mobile -- they will split, bringing down your tips.   You control this madness -- and it becomes true madness -- by using the number pad to assign customers to tables. Once seated, pressing the number associated with that table performs whatever action is appropriate for the stage of the meal, such as delivering food or collecting the check. Other activities, like serving beverages and mopping up baby spills, are attached to other keys, like #. The system works quite well. Is it better than a mouse on your home computer? No. But I never had a single problem juggling a full house of hungry, hungry hippos.   I played the game all day on a Sony Ericsson w810i -- no slouch of a handset. The game looks great, with inviting colors and cute little sprites. The sound effects are fine, too, with little scratches and beeps accompanying you as you scurry all over the restaurants.  Diner Dash 2 does not reinvent the game's wildly successful formula -- nor does it need to. As a huge fan of the original game, I hardly hesitate to recommend this strong follow-up.", "date": "Oct 9, 2007"}
