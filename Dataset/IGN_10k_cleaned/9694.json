But between the ugly graphics, confusing environments and lack of anything fun to do, the game unfortunately becomes one more brick in the DSI wall of mediocrity.    Based off a pretty interesting CG documentary from National Geographic, Sea Monsters delves into the lives of the various prehistoric aquatic beasts scientists believe swam the oceans millions of years ago. There was plenty of room for a smart game design here to teach kids about these prehistoric behemoths while entertaining them. Instead, the game revolves around swimming a limited, confusing ocean, eating anything smaller than the playable creature and occasionally surfacing for air. That's it.    Creatures are separated into prey and predator categories, depending on the hierarchy status of the currently-controlled beast, and given different icons on the map to indicate each. The player is encouraged to dash at prey while avoiding predators. However, the predators in this game are pretty listless and don't pose much of a threat either. They can also be killed just as easily as the prey, requiring a few more dashes before they stop moving and start floating to the surface.    Each creature has three attributes: Hunger, which is replenished by eating smaller creatures, oxygen, which is replenished by swimming up to the surface, and stamina, which should probably be related to how much the creature moves around, but instead seems to also be linked to the oxygen. Aside from monitoring these levels, searching out creatures to eat and challenges to engage in, there's basically nothing to this game.    In an attempt to add variety to the gameplay, each prehistoric creature has its own special ability. So while one can swim stealthy, another can dig, another can break rocks, and another can jump. Specific creatures need to be used to reach specific objectives, and the player isn't able to exhaust the game until they've unlocked all six playable creatures. Creatures are unlocked through fossil discovery. As soon as every bone of a creature's skeleton is found, the player can take control of that creature at leisure.    It's all wet.   Fossils are the name of the game, and the player progresses by finding fossils or earning them in underwater challenges. Finding fossils unlocks the other playable sea creatures, which makes even more fossils attainable, since special skills are required to locate many of them. The underwater challenges are more of a chore than a challenge though, usually involving eating a certain amount of fish but without any sort of timer or condition to fight against (other than the numbing boredom, of course). Completing a challenge earns the player one fossil, however finding challenges can be a real pain in the butt. The bulk of the game occurs in a sea environment called The Hub, which leads to portals and other points of access that relocate the player to new underwater environments. The problem is that the hub is massive, repetitive and confusing to navigate. Everything looks the same, so forget about beating the challenges; it's finding them that's the real challenge. Things aren't helped by the fact that most of the creatures move achingly slow; even when the player can see where they're headed, they won't actually get there for several minutes.    The sea creatures are controlled with a combination of buttons and stylus. The control pad is used to turn and move forward or backward, while the touch screen is used to look around and change direction, ala first person shooter controls. Holding down the L button locks onto prey and double-tapping the touch screen dashes the creature at it. The controls work well enough, although turning (even using the game's quick turn move) is a little sluggish. Thankfully holding down the L button will continue readjusting the camera so that the player always has a clear view of whatever they're hunting.    Because the sea is so shallow, the creature is constantly popping up above the surface of the water. This makes for an interesting visual transition, but the water surface isn't translucent so it's pretty jarring to be hunting prey one second and then have all underwater visibility gone the next. Staying underwater and tracking prey without popping up can be somewhat of a challenge. And there's something preventing the player from swimming deep enough to avoid this problem: Deep Water.    For some reason, most of the creatures in this game can't swim deeper than about fifty feet underwater. If they do, the player will get a ~Deep Water~ text warning and the creature's oxygen and stamina will start dropping like crazy, forcing the player to immediately swim to the surface to keep from dying within a few seconds. Call me cynical, but I think if a giant sea turtle swam a couple of extra feet underwater, it wouldn't start spiraling out of control like a downed fighter jet. The deep water prohibition doesn't seem to affect the AI creatures, which swim as deep as they like. Frequently I would find myself hunting a creature, only to be led by it to the bottom of the sea and have to abandon my hunt prematurely in order to survive.    These overbearing fail systems also overlap, so if a creature runs low on stamina and health, it will begin to drop like a rock until those meters refill. During this descent, the player may be forced into deep water and be killed anyway. There just wasn't a lot of thought put into how much these consequences ruin gameplay. Why would kids be expected to explore when, like Icarus, they get punished for exploring too far?    The environments are pretty ugly with bland design and repetitious textures. Although there's sonar on the bottom screen, it only displays prey and predators in the immediate area. It's far too easy to get lost in these environments and caught swimming in circles because everything looks the same. Since the game features a fair bit of level progression, it would have made sense to use the bottom screen for an actual map of the environment. By the time prey pops up on the map, it's usually already in plain view on the top screen anyway, rendering the bottom screen pretty useless.    The sea creature models look slightly better than the environment and animate as one would expect them to, although swimming through some of the larger underwater valleys can cause the framerate to dip noticeably. 2D art and effects are plain but by no means bad.    Each time the player locates a fossil, it can be accessed by clicking the fossil icon. Here, the player can learn bit of trivia about each sea creature by clicking on the various bones of its skeleton. There are 19 skeletons to piece together. Although this mode is informational, it's about all that is in this game and feels like sort of a last ditch attempt to turn this into something other than a random fish-gobbling game. Considering this game is based on a pretty interesting National Geographic film, the game as a whole is pretty shallow (no pun intended). Forget the fact that this game isn't very educational outside of the fossils mode. The real problem is it's shallow and boring. The idea of swimming around the deep as different prehistoric aquatic creatures sounds appealing, but doing nothing but swimming and eating in confusing, ugly environments gets old fast.", "date": "Dec 5, 2007"}
