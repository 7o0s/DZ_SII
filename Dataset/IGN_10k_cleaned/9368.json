Enter Magician Lord. This title, a side-scrolling action platformer from the Neo platform, was one of the earliest, notable non-fighting games released for SNK's hardware back in the early '90s. And though it's not an amazing title, and it hasn't held up as well as many of its contemporaries from the same era, Magician Lord still helps to round out the perception of its originating system.    Elta is a wizard; a wizard in a blue hat and cape, who makes his living walking to the right side of screens and throwing little waves of blue magic energy. He's also an avid reader, and his quest in Magician Lord is to walk to the right side of screens, throwing waves of energy, and defeating bad guys and bosses in order to get his hands on eight legendary books to read -- the eight mystical tomes of power that, within, contain the wisdom that will banish the villain Gul-Agieze from the planet.   And things are pretty straightforward for Elta, and you, controlling Elta, should be able to master his movements quickly on beginning his quest -- energy waves can be thrown out both above and below you in addition to side to side, and the toughest obstacle to overcome is the stiff overall feeling of the controls. This is another early SNK endeavor, and the fluidity with which the company's characters would flow in later games hadn't yet been mastered -- so Magician Lord feels a bit too rigid, and it's a bit too easy to take damage from enemies that you'd expect to be able to defeat or dodge with fewer problems.   That's also an artifact of Magician Lord's arcade origins, as many of these kinds of games were designed with money in mind. If the player dies more often than they'd expect to, hopefully they'll keep dropping in more quarters to buy more lives. You could find yourself getting frustrated at some of the bosses' attack patterns, or the placement of certain damaging obstacles throughout the stages. They're oftentimes avoidable, after a bit of trial and error, but seem cheap to begin with.   Elta eventually happens upon the power to transform himself, a la Altered Beast, into more powerful forms with expanded offensive ability -- like the fire-breathing Dragon Warrior, and a ninja form that throws what look to be flaming bolas. A total of six different transformed forms can be found, but will only last as long as you can avoid significant damage. Take too many hits, and you're downgraded again into good old, normal Elta.   Worth mentioning, too, is Magician Lord's soundtrack, which feels far more robust than you'd expect and offers a great example of what the Neo Geo hardware could do for the audio component of a game's presentation. Its rich quality should be appreciated, so crank up the volume.Which you should, if this style of high-challenge action platformer is your kind of game. Fans of Capcom's Ghouls 'N Ghosts series and the old-school, linear Castlevania adventures would probably be the closest candidates to becoming appreciative players of Magician Lord, along with nostalgic past Neo-Geo gamers. But don't invest if that doesn't describe you.", "date": "Oct 30, 2007"}
