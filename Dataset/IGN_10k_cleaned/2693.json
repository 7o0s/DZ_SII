For the GBA version of Acclaim's baseball series, the company went with Creations, the UK-based developer that was actually, believe it or not, responsible for Nintendo's first Ken Griffey title on the Super NES. All-Star 2003 bears absolutely no resemblance to that game, rather the team has adopted the look and feel of Acclaim's console versions for the portable rendition. And while the team did an admirable job in the conversion with tons of gameplay features for the baseball junkie, the game has some gameplay issues to work out for the next season. Features All Major League teams and players Exhibition, Season, All-Star, Home Run Derby Full Season tracking (cartridge save) Link cable support for two players  Collectable Donruss cards (trade via link cable) Only for Game Boy Advance   The game has all the bells and whistles that are expected in a decent baseball game. You know the drill: all Major League Baseball teams and players, a season mode that can be broken down into 162, 87, 81, 29, three or a single game of round robin, playoff and World Series modes, All-Star Games, and a Home Run Derby. The game promises all of the league's stadiums with rendered backgrounds during the pitcher/batter interface, but realistically it's just a generic park...once the ball's hit out on the field even Fenway looks like the Vet.  All-Star also does a great job tracking all the statistics during the season and saving it to the cartridge back-up, keeping tabs of all of the players as well as who you've traded away during the season. And, yep, link cable is supported so that players don't have to keep playing against the computer opponents.  Creations built a decent pitcher-batter interface for the GBA version, basing it off the excellent interface established in the console versions...which means players can place their hits a lot more easily than in other GBA baseball games. The cursor can be rotated in three dimensions to make it a snap for players to hit a grounder or popfly to left, right or center field...players don't have to blindly send their balls into the field. Timing is still key, as is strike-zone anticipation, but if you want to insure that you nail a ball to the ground, you have that ability. The pitching interface is less creative, though, as the development team went with more of a menu selection for players to choose their pitch instead of the normal ~press up for a sinker, down for a fastball,~ type selection interface. Not that it doesn't work in All-Star 2003...it just doesn't have that quick-select feel of other hardball games.  When the ball gets in play, the game switches to a very cool Mode-7 viewpoint that scales in a slightly angled perspective, zooming in and out depending on the location of the ball. All of the game's fielder animations and background art are well produced in this scaling perspective. Overall, it's a solid playing game of baseball with noticable quirks in its fielding, and it's when the ball is in play when we hit upon the weaknesses of All-Star 2003. Most annoyingly is the game's habit of following the ball when it heads into the outfield...the screen locks onto the ball and not to the location of its landing point, which means the player has absolutely NO idea where his fielders are in relation to where the ball will hit the field. The radar offers a little help in this regard, but the little blips representing your players don't make it easy to see their location in reference to the actual gameplay screen. Super high flyballs seem to confuse the computer controlled fielders...they'll just wander confusedly under the ball, and many times let the ball land on the ground before scooping it up. And advancing a runner for a double is a pain because many times it won't let you run off of first base until the outfielder actually picks up the ball.   I've even had an instance where the computer opponent had bases loaded with no outs...a line-drive grounder to the pitcher let me get the force-out at home, but when I threw it to third for the double play forceout, the runner to third turned around and went back to second. It didn't register the force-out, so I had to tag him out, which means a triple play just wasn't possible.  And the game's sound does need some serious tweaks in the sound department...menu music tries to be bold but comes off sloppy, and the tunes during the game are just downright irritating. At least you can turn off most of the audio during play. Of all the sports games on the Game Boy Advance, the baseball genre is the most crowded, with 3DO, Sega, and Acclaim vying for your hardball dollar. All-Star Baseball 2003 is a solid, enjoyable effort that has its own quirks and gaping flaws...it definitely has room for improvement, but its foundation is strong enough for Creation's team to build the next year's version upon. Sega's Baseball Advance is this season's victor, but Acclaim's game comes in a near second.", "date": "Jun 5, 2002"}
