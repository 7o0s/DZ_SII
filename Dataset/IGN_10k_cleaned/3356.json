Over the past 4 years or so there has been a steady release of Tycoon themed games streaming from developers across the land.  From railroads to rollercoasters and from theme parks to zoos or even, yes...malls.  One might stop and think, ok guys, enough is enough already, get a new idea!  Well, one would certainly be thinking a little too optimistically, as yet another tycoon has emerged from the deep trenches of developers who are hoping to cash in on the extreme success of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series.  Friends, welcome to Trailer Park Tycoon, the latest effort from Jaleco Entertainment.     By now you're probably wondering what this game is all about.  You start off with the option of undertaking various scenarios in constructing your ultimate Trailer Park.  Yes, that's right, folks; you are now in control of drastically lowering surrounding property values by littering your trailer park with trashy people, sights, and if you deem it necessary, even great big tire heaps.  The idea is simple:  make your trailer park flourish by attracting new tenants, and most importantly, keeping them happy.   There is, however, vary little variation in the means in which you must do this. People get unhappy quite easily, and the way you can cheer them up is by either lowering their rent (or in some insane cases, people get manic depressive if they aren't paying enough), or by satisfying their need for the elusive flashy and trashy.  Flashy and trashy?  You might think that sounds like a catch line for an episode of Jerry Springer.  Well you'd probably be right, as you have to satisfy their trashy urges by throwing some pretty disturbing landmarks into their trailer's vicinity.  Take for example a nice hose pile. What wealthy, neighboring landowner who lives on the other side of the overpass isn't going to enjoy glancing out his window and seeing a pile of hoses?  Or how about a cinderblock igloo?  I know I would personally enjoy taking a gander at some good old fashioned dumpster art.  The world is your oyster!    Aside from satisfying your tenants and angering the neighboring community with things that are trashy and flashy, you also have to account for individual preferences.  Some people enjoy cool and hip things that are new to the scene like a giant brick barbecue pit, while others are more conservative and want to stay old school, say with a nice plastic outhouse in their front yard.     As the sole designer of your trailer park, you have many hilarious options to spruce up the park and make it more lively and enjoyable for the residents.  To increase your income as a landlord you must also erect various amenities that are both necessities for you and your tenants.  Building a Laundromat and a movie theatre are some basic requirements for the satisfaction of your trailer park tras- erm, friendly people...yeah, friendly people, we'll go with that.  To keep them entertained, you can also put in place swap n' shops which act like flea markets and even a shooting gallery where the ever essential target practice can take place.  Even a local biker hangout can be put smack dab in the middle of a cluster of trailers and they won't mind!  Heck, they'll love you for it!  Just make sure you steadily increase the price of admission/membership at various places or else you'll be running them at a loss.     So what will you do now with all this money?  Well, that's the problem with the game, really.  After you've been building your park for a half hour or so (in scenario mode) you'll probably have met the scenario guidelines and the game will be over (or alternatively you will fail to complete the specified parameters of the mission and something EVIL will happen, like a giant, fire-breathing, red-eyed, antler bearing, people-stomping, 18 foot tall rabbit may come traipsing in and tear your park to pieces).  So now all you can really do is start up another scenario.  This wouldn't be so much of a problem if there were at least some variety in the scenarios themselves.  However, they're all very basic and shallow, with few guidelines to meet and little challenge to entail.   In Tycoon mode you are given more freedom as there is no set time limit, yet you'll still encounter the same ultimate problem that most Tycoon games present:  you'll have so much money that there is little else to do.  This usually isn't that much of an issue because in other games there will be other parks to design, more land to purchase, and generally more things to keep you (and of course your inhabitants!) entertained.  However, in Trailer Park Tycoon, the depth does not stretch all that far, and you will reach the game's capacity much too quickly for the game to be overly enjoyable.  This is most unfortunate because while the concept of the game is borrowed, tried and true, it is still entertaining and fun to watch.   While every tycoon master would love to see his ultimate park stretch far into the sky with gold-plated outhouses and platinum-crested toilet seats, there is only so much that can happen aesthetically, and this is where the micro-management comes into play.  Once again, this is another of the games drawbacks because sometimes you really don't know what to do to make your tenants content.  By clicking on various people you can determine whether they're happy or not, but if they aren't, there is no clue as to what you can do to remedy the situation.  This quickly leads to frustration as at any given time there can be at least a dozen people, who are dissatisfied with their current state of living, and carefully trying to make each one happy is just not fun -- it's annoying.    On the positive side of micromanagement, I am happy to say the developers included an option that enables you to take direct control over individuals and do with them as you please.  No, that doesn't mean throwing them into oncoming traffic (you sick freak!).  Instead, you can have them incite conversations with other people if they're being antisocial, if there is tension between two tenants (maybe one guy accidentally let his rat infested playhouse creep onto his neighbors property, you can have them duke it out to relieve the aggression.  This option enables you to sometimes rectify the instances in which tenants refuse to stay content, but sometimes it does not, and you keep on wondering what to do.     Graphically Trailer Park Tycoon is a mixed bag.  From far away things appear bright, colorful, and detailed.  However, as you zoom in (as you're going to want to, it gets boring just sitting at bird's eye view), you'll notice how little detail there in fact is on each individually rendered building or structure.  This is mainly due to the fact that the game does not support resolutions higher than 1024x768.  You can, however, salvage a few laughs from the appearance of the characters, as they walk around sporting their mullets and pimp clothes.  The frame rate is consistently high, and the ability zoom in is a nice feature, but is harbored by the inability to rotate the camera (a novelty that many games are now implementing, yet one that this game does not).   The sounds in the game are uninspired and oftentimes irritating. Every time you make any amount of money a ~ching-ching~ sound will blast through your ears.  If it was once a minute, by all means, blast away?but it's every 4 seconds!  The only remedy to this is turning off the sound effects altogether (which is kind of like shooting Lassie because he won't stop barking.  You know, he's so friendly otherwise).  The random chatter between people is usually pretty funny as they quibble about their menial jobs and pathetic lives.  I'm just using intuition here because they mumble just like the characters in The Sims; there is no coherent speech to speak of (what a pun!).  The music is your stereotypical country red-neck banjo fiesta that you can listen to for about a minute before you start tearing your hear out and crying like a little girl.     What did you think of Trailer Park Tycoon?   All in all Trailer Park Tycoon is a clone among clones.  Whatever originality may be present is harbored by the repetition and lack of depth that the game deals out in large helpings.  It may be fun for an hour or two, but after that, there really isn't much to keep you playing.  Trailer Park Tycoon is good for a laugh (the tabloids that intermittently present themselves are usually quite funny, and getting stomped by random natural disasters lightens the normally solemn mood) and a quick romp in trailer park country.  But I find it really hard to recommend this game when it doesn't quite offer much else in regards to gameplay, graphics, and sound that other games have handled so well.  Even years after the release of Roller Coaster Tycoon, developers are dwelling on an idea that could still hold strong, but only if implemented well.  Trailer Park Tycoon doesn't succeed in the long term, and is doomed to be lost amidst all the other clones that have emerged in this crowded market.  Furthermore, the game is not a value title, so you'll be paying full pop.  Give this one a pass.", "date": "Jan 6, 2003"}
