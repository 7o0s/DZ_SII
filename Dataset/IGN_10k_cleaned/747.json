{"name": "Carrier", "name_review": "Carrier", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/01/carrier", "text": "In some ways, I think it's fair to compare the Carrier/Resident Evil situation to the whole teeny pop infestation of late. Namely, the arrival of any new young chick with a voice and the ability to wiggle inevitable collision with  Britney Spears.  Strange, I know -- But don't get your maxis in a traffic jam just yet. It just seems like no new ~artist~ can pop her tight little body into the cozy MTV circle of celebrity without immediately being compared to the voluptuous Britney. And no matter what special features or innovative refinements a given babolic teen singer may have, she just never seems to be as generously endowed (none of the other teen goddesses have had the same caliper of ~growth spurt~ as Britney thus far). Just not as rackalicious. Bustacious. Boobnelific. Tittonic. Why? I'm not sure, but, as I promised, it compares very distinctly to our revered survival horror genre. No matter how well executed Carrier is (or isn't), no matter what it may have that slightly differentiates the gameplay from RE, as long as it follows that same old formula, it will always be viewed as a poor man's version of the classic series. Granted, it actually is quite similar to RE in many ways, but that off-brand stigma will follow it and possibly even undeservingly retard its retail success. Carrier actually is a good game on its own, and has enough to offer to the genre to mark it as a respect-worthy entry.  First off, I'd like to put an end to anyone who is verbally categorizing Carrier in the same bed as Blue Stinger. Your pitiful lives are about to be ended. Even if for the sake of discussion, it's unfair to put these games alongside each other. While Blue Stinger is a decidedly confused and misdirected band wagon leaper, Carrier is a quality product with actual attention given to production values and playability.  While it may not absolutely scream Resident Evil, you don't have to be a very smart person to pick up on the fact that they probably had several copies of RE2 and Dino Crisis around the office during ~brain-storm~ sessions. The atmosphere is there. The predictably unpredictable ~ginna jump out atchee!~ moments are there. The whole Resident Evil equation is intact, giving it a familiar enough feel that players can slide into the new gameplay elements without any problem. Most importantly, however, is that Carrier moves along at a very smooth pace and never really stumps you with impossible situations or puzzles. Backtracking is kept within reasonable boundaries, and most situations presented throughout the course of the game are self explanatory and logical enough that most people won't be slowed down or frustrated. This whole ~no $&#t, no artificial challenge, just real gameplay~ feel is perhaps the best thing Carrier has going for it, and after dealing with the ludicrous amount of back tracking and artificial challenge present in Resident Evil 3, it's actually quite a refreshing departure.  The game's setting seems to be a good mix of Aliens, Resident Evil, and the lesser known movie Virus. Basically, you have your large aircraft carrier embanked in a colorful story setting. After taking a mysterious organism (known as ARK) on board, things go wrong and soon a terrible virus is spreading throughout all of the crew causing them to mutate into vile and dangerous monsters. You play Jack Ingless, who is part of an away team sent to investigate the happenings aboard the ship. What makes it interesting, however, is that the carrier is automatically shooting down everything that comes near, and, as such, the chopper that Jack's crew came in on is shot down. The game begins with Jack separated from his team, with his basic mission being to find out what the hell is going on, as at this point you really don't know. The story actually ends up being much more complex and ambitious than many people will expect, and it unfolds gradually throughout the game. It's a little predictable in places, but overall very well written and quite engrossing.  Although you begin the game as Jack, after completing Jack's scenario, you are given a scenario to play as Jack's accomplice, Jessifer. Jessifer's scenario is around half as long as Jack's, but still definitely more than an afterthought. Jack's scenario took me about 8 hours to finish  Those of you who lack genetically enhanced gaming skills will need about 10-13 hours. With Jessifer's scenario thrown in, you're looking at quite a good sized chunk of gaming with very little filler.  As mentioned before, the game has several significant departures from the Playstation Resident Evil franchise. First, the combat system is much more functional. Not only can you choose weapons on the fly, but aiming is made incredibly easy by indicators that appear over the enemy when you are aiming at them. With the ability to aim anywhere up or down, (not just confined to three ~clicks~, down, level, and up, as seen in RE) there's never any question as to whether or not you will hit your target, or which target you will hit. Again, this takes away from the ~artificial challenge~ factor present in RE, allowing you to focus more on the story and gameplay itself.  Another infinitely interesting gameplay element is the BEM-T3 Scope. Basically, this is a scope that, when looked through, allows you to see whether an individual is infected, see in the dark, and allows you to see through some walls. Based on that text-book description, the scope may sound more like a gimmick than anything else -- But I assure you it's not. Given the game's setting it intertwines perfectly, infinitely enhancing suspense and playability. When viewed through, the scope switches to a first person perspective, and takes about three seconds to give you a clear picture. When initially using it to peer into a dark hallway, it can be very unnerving waiting for the picture to clear up enough to see if anything's approaching you in the dark. There are also some enemies that are mostly invisible, and the best way to confirm their presence is to look through the scope. Again, spooky.  Visually, Carrier is quite good -- Considerably better than the Dreamcast average. The characters and backgrounds are incredibly detailed and high res. Sometimes your surroundings look strikingly like pre-rendered images -- But they're not. It's all real time 3D. If you're wondering, no, it's not on the same level as the upcoming gaming nirvana known as Resident Evil: Code Veronica, but it is still considerably better than many Dreamcast games, and in some places will astonish you with its prowess. If I was going to nit pick, I'd say that the characters could be a bit less blocky looking, and some of your movement animations aren't quite as well-integrated within each other as they could be, namely the turn around move. In addition, the game tends to slow down when you're in a larger area with more things happening  But it's almost a different flavor of slow down, as rather than losing frames, the game actually appears to be moving in slow motion (like a sports replay). Curious.  In the end, Resident Evil is Carrier's best friend and worst enemy. On the one hand, Carrier's very foundation is based on that built by RE -- Without it, the game wouldn't be here. On the other hand, Carrier (as well as any other entry in this niche genre) will always be standing in RE's shadow. After all of these philosophical ramblings, however, we find that Carrier is nothing short of a top-notch contender in the field, with solid play mechanics to go around and enough new ideas to make it stand alone. The game isn't very hard, but the flow never stops, so rest assured your interest will be piqued from the beginning to the end. It's definitely more than a tease of what's to come upon next month's release of Code Veronica, and fans of the genre are encouraged to check it out.  --Matt White, Survival Whore-er", "date": "Mar 1, 2000"}
