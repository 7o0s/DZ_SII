And I was just the man to help... well, woman sometimes, but that's another story. It's been a month since City of Heroes was released to store shelves and I can firmly say that I still really like this game. That isn't to say that it doesn't need some improvements in certain areas, but what Cryptic has created here is nothing less than one of the most exciting MMOs that I've ever played with the coolest premise.   What is City of Heroes? It's a massively multiplayer game that lets players sink themselves into the role of a fledgling hero, just awakened to his or her powers in search of bringing justice to Paragon City, a place under assault from all sorts of nefarious people and creatures. There's a pretty large background story which you can find at the official site if you're interested. The basic gist is that players have to hit the streets, ~arrest~ some evil-doers, and increase their powers to take on the even worse baddies.   Like many MMOs are trying to do nowadays, City of Heroes tries to tie the story into the gameplay. And like many MMOs it does a mixed job of it and will require some reading, which I really don't mind even if some do. The story will unfold for each hero as they receive missions from various contacts who will unfold situations as well as clues found on these missions that will explain what is happening even more. As players progress in level, the story will move along different arcs leading to boss characters and more. It's really hard to institute a continuous and deep story in a game that has so many players moving through it at the same time. I do with there were some in game cutscenes for important parts of certain missions... but maybe that's too hard as well. Overall, considering the limitations of the genre, the story arcs can be interesting and will drive players on into new areas.   But before any hero's story can begin, they must be born. The character creation in City of Heroes is hands down the best I've ever seen for an MMO. Creating a costume for your character is not only fun, but addicting. I've literally spent hours creating costumes and looks for various types of characters. The best part is, while there are costumes that are similar in the game, I have yet to see any identical costumes, except from some people that had obviously planned it that way.     Picking powers and progression for the powers isn't as robust as Freedom Force, which had about as many options for super powers as there were for costumes in City of Heroes, but that's also understandable. But I would have liked to have seen at least some customization for color of powers and maybe effects for certain powers like flying based on powers you've picked during the game... but overall, it's an amazing system that I've enjoyed tremendously.   The graphics in general are also very good. Having played a bunch of the World of Warcraft beta, I do find myself wishing for a little more variety in terms of areas, such as suburbs, hillier areas, but the zones that are there are full of life and fun to run through. Later levels such as Founders Falls, Brickstown, and Eden are certainly do a good job of this and I hope the new levels added continue to mimic the attention paid to these beautiful zones.   The special effects are worth special mention as well. Not only are they brilliant and gaudy, but they drive the excitement of the battles. If the effects weren't this good, combat wouldn't be as interesting.   Once a character is created, the game provides a brief tutorial to get players accustomed to the controls as well as give the character enough experience to be granted their first increase in security level. Level increases reward players with new powers or enhancements slots for the items that can increase the effectiveness of powers.     There are a good number of choices for powers, but I can't help be wish for some that would allow players to pick cars or lamp posts up and use them as weapons. I'm not asking for destructible environments like Freedom Force had (I just can't see that in a game of this type), but a few objects that could be destroyed such as store windows and lamps would have been cool and could be ~repaired~ by the citizens in the city.   In any case, there are plenty of powers that are all very useful and will create an exciting battleground once the baddies have been spotted. Combat is really where this game has it down. Powers fly, enemies are merciless, and crap can hit the fan with an amazing amount of force. Battles are frantic, fantastic, and fun!   While the game allows players to fight on their own (there are tons of bad people and things roaming the streets of Paragon City), City of Heroes really encourages team play in a lot of ways. The battles are much more intense, the enemy mobs can be much more challenging, but most of all, finding a team is easy as pie and almost everyone that I've met in City of Heroes has been extremely nice and helpful (even if my female character Nikki Star did get some unwanted attention from some disturbed individuals). Most MMOs I've played I haven't come back to simply because it's too hard to find a group, meet up with them, and finally make it to a quest only to find that the people I'm playing with are a bunch of jerkwads with serious social issues. The interface here lets players advertise their availability on a list that shows their origin and archetype so that others forming groups can simply peruse this list and invite random players. I think the longest I've ever waited for a group in my time playing was 15 minutes and that was in the higher level areas at 1:00 in the morning. It's still possible that you could get stuck with impatient players that will get you killed, but even then, most of the people will apologize and listen to advice. Either I've been extraordinarily lucky in my groups or this community is really great. Unfortunately I can really only speak for my own experiences.     The main problem with the gameplay is that it can get fairly repetitive. Missions in the game can be lumped into indoor and outdoor missions. Outdoor missions usually involve hunting down a certain number of bad guys from one of the various groups. Indoor missions vary a tiny bit, but still mostly involve ~arresting~ (looks more like killing to me), a lot of bad guys in a zone instanced for one group. Teams may have to interact with objects to find clues or save the thousands of homeless people that have all been abducted for experiments, but there's no real immediacy about it. The homeless people won't die if you do things wrong, the clues won't disappear if you don't hurry, and the buildings won't blow up if you fail to diffuse the bombs. Each of the missions boil down to arresting the crap out of everyone in the building and maybe interacting with some stuff.   The indoor areas themselves are also a bit repetitive. There are sewers, warehouses, offices, abandoned offices, caves, and later on in levels some bunkers, decorated caves, and underground labs. The underground lab is particularly cool and really makes me wish that they had more variety. Representatives for NCsoft and Cryptic have already said that they're creating more indoor environments so that makes me happy.   I also wish there were some different types of missions that were a little more frantic and interactive. Maybe destroying a machine that spawns new clockwork robots, or destroying magical objects that protect a certain villain before being able to actually attack him. Some of these towards the beginning of the game would be well appreciated, especially since the enemies aren't as cool as they are for higher levels. Regardless of their repetitiveness, these missions still manage to be a lot of fun for a long time. There's something supremely satisfying about taking down a bunch of bosses and minions in a gigantic and stressful battle with a good group of heroes at your side, especially at higher levels with so many powers flying every which way.    What we get is actually a very Diabloesque experience with more style and class. The main difference here is that heroes won't collect thousands of pieces of loot, weapons and armor. This is actually something that might hurt the game, even if I like it. Half the reason people continue to play Diablo II is to get the next best item. There is no such drive here. Instead of items, players can find enhancements to make their powers more effective, but the best ones can be bought in stores and they aren't shown on the character in the game world. This totally makes sense for a superhero game where a character is totally identified by the costume. Adding little bits of armor and whatnot would be bizarre. They are going to add trophy cases to hold items collected from various raids however. We'll have to see whether that holds the itemmongerers' attention.   One of the best features for this game is actually something that I expect to see in more MMOs as time increases. City of Heroes' Sidekick ability allows players of level 11 or above to add lower level characters as their sidekicks, allowing them to fight at much higher levels and see what higher level characters experience all the time. It's a brilliant feature that encourages social behavior while not penalizing higher level characters for hanging out with lower levels.    Getting up to the higher levels can take a long time as well, so you don't see a ton of high level heroes (leveling goes much slower after the mid-teens) but we did get to check out the retardedly difficult areas and extreme powers and were pleased by the power of heroes and enemies even if missions still seemed to take the same route even at those levels.     The really great thing is that Cryptic seems very dedicated to making the game as good as an experience as they can. They've already annouced the first big free update that will add new zones, new enemies, and new features and they're sure to bring even more along the way. Real PvP will enter when the first expansion City of Villains is released next year along with what I can imagine will be a slew of improvements and features. There's still a little bit of fine tuning as far as balancing goes, but Paragon City's future looks good.  I'm not going to lie and say it's the deepest MMO that I've ever experienced. There's no crafting and there aren't any real items players can show off, but that's not the point of the game. The atmosphere created here is friendly, vivacious, and exciting. It's freakin' fun to have superpowers and Cryptic has done an amazing job creating this city and filling it with goodies.This is really one of the first MMOs that really allow casual players the chance to play and have a good time without feeling like they're being left behind. The wonderful sidekick system helps as does the extraordinary ease of finding a team to play with.The game isn't without its faults however, gameplay can be repetitive as can the indoor areas and missions. The story arcs could use a little bit of help as could some of the mostly awesome interface. Some interactivity with the city environments would be a welcome addition as well.But the bottom line is this. City of Heroes is fun! It's exciting, it's colorful, it's cute, it's brutal, and it's a great realization of comic books in MMO form. It seems like a great place to start for those that have always found MMOs intimidating. I say good job to Cryptic and hope they continue improving an already good game for those that stick with it.", "date": "May 29, 2004"}
