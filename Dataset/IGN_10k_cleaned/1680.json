The Delphine-developed Moto Racer World Tour, now under Infogrames' arm, not EA's, is the third in the ~series~ and is perhaps the best in a number of ways.    Moto Racer World Tour won't win you over with the smoothest graphics or the best sound effects, but it sure takes the cake for pure arcade motorcycle racing. At least in the single-player mode, Moto Racer World Tour is a fast-paced whirlwind of racing tactics, blending in simulation and arcade-style gameplay into one stunning piece of kit. Yes, it's stunning. Just like the first game that blew everyone away back in 1996, Delphine knows its motorcycle racing better than anybody, and World Tour stacks up there with the best.   Gamplay What I like, and have always liked about this game, is its speedy, easy-to-play sensibility. Anyone can pick up the game and get right to it, no qualms. To complement this, the game also sports an enormous replay value because the competition gets much harder as you progress through it, not to mention the 15-plus courses that all require tons of practice to master.    Much like the two former Moto Racer games World Tour delivers a straight-up Arcade mode for a single race, with choices of courses that span the full gamut of the game. World Tour Championships invites players to race through three seasons of increasingly difficult courses in both 125 CC and 250 CC competitions, while opening up bonus courses if you perform particularly well. World Tour Championships is the core of the game. Without a doubt it's the most challenging, and in later levels, I would even say, it's the hardest part of the game.   In World Tour Championships players can modify and upgrade their bikes without much trouble. The modifications don't require any skill or previous rankings, so they're quite simple. Players choose ~The Pits,~ which include a generally detailed modification system for brakes, tires, engines and acceleration speeds. Players can change the parameters of each gear, high or low, or they can go to the Performance Chart, which enables you to alter your engine's long range speed, or acceleration, for starters. They can check up on their tires and suspension, both of which obviously enable you to change these areas from soft to medium to hard. Players also can select from a choice of eight fictional biking teams, as well as from a list of bikes. Other than some standard gear and fluid sponsors, the developers who created World Tour have opted to forgo acquiring any big racing legends of bikes or an particular make, which may leave some folks flat. For a game such as Gran Turismo, licenses are crucial, but for a game such as World Tour, there isn't much need for any real bikers, because the gameplay itself is so damn good.   For players who aren't familiar with Delphine's Moto Racer titles, World Tour is a fast, arcade-style racing game that relies on the thrill of speed, sharp turns and high-level competition. Moto Racer delivers in all of these areas. In all of the single-player modes, World Tour clocks in with a clean 30 frames per second, and rarely dips under 30 for more than a second. Granted, there aren't any more than four other racers on screen at one point, but with all five on at once, the rate isn't any slower. With good framerates come an exceptional sense of speed, and it's all here in perfect form.   As for the game's sense of control and balance, World Tour also comes up with shining colors. Taking sharp turns isn't a total bore, not is it a massive chore. In other words, it's arcade biking, folks. But it's really good arcade racing. You need some skill, but you don't have to be a frickin' pro biker to play the game and win. Acceleration times are fast right off the tee, enabling players to zip into the straight-aways instantly, or to pull out of a turn and crank the acceleration to beat out the leader of the pack. Taking turns is also a matter of some skill, and a basic knowledge of driving lines, which are relatively easy to see in the game, is required; but again, pro skill isn't needed.   The set of animations that show the biker leaning into his turns is exceptional, which makes for some very fluid motion in almost every occasion. The bikes react differently in dirt or grass than on pavement, and in dirt you'll pull off donuts if you aren't careful. Which is a really nice touch, to be honest. I wanted to feel like I was riding a really powerful, capable bike, and when I get into the dirt, I want to peel out occasionally for the fun of it, and here I can. Likewise, if you rev the engine full blast at the starting line, you'll create a great cloud of smoke and stink until the bike finally grips the pavement and gets traction. You'll even swerve to and fro for a few seconds until the bike is under full control. The crash animations are killer, and the collision detection is superb. Normally I only complain when it's bad, but here, it's superb. Players may hit a wall at a medium speed, and won't crash, and they may touch it and won't crash either. It's only when you really smash into a wall when you get it. That's the way it's supposed to be, but it's exceptionally perfect in World Tour.   The overall variety of World Tour may not excel past other Delphine racers (i.e. Moto Racer 2), but then on the other hand, World Tour outdoes its older brothers in other ways. Moto Racer 2 had a pretty good edit mode for creating personal tracks, but World Tour doesn't have this feature. However, there are 18 total courses, from all over the world, many of which re-create the original courses with great detail. The courses include Sachsenring, Suzuka, Isle of Man (Road), Isle of Man (Hills), Isle of Man (Town) Eastern Creek, Barcelona, USA Park, Stade De France, Reygades, Belo Horizonte, Speed Ring, Freestyle, Rive Gauche, Trial (Night show), Highway, West Coast, and Trial (Indoor).   Additionally, once you win some championships, as many as four new play modes open up. Traffic enables you to race against another player against traffic; Dragster is for straight-up speed competitions; Freestyle is created for pure stunt riding; and Trial enables you to perform jumps over obstacles in a specified amount of time. All of these latter modes are opened as rewards for doing well, and add a great deal of fun to the game. I particularly liked Traffic, but it's tough!   Graphics OK, I'll be straight-forward with this one. For a PlayStation game, the graphics are not great, but not terrible either. The biker animation, for instance, is superb, and without a doubt better than that seen in Moto GP, a PS2 game! Whenever you pull off the slightest turn, the biker's body adjusts, whether it be the rear end, legs, torso or even his shoulders, the bikers move fluidly and naturally, and it gives the game great sense of speed and motion. The bikes are also very detailed, with excellent design in terms of aerodynamics, and curves. Likewise, the bikers themselves are highly detailed and realistic looking.   When it comes to background graphics, World Tour won't win any awards, and from what I can tell, they look only a tad better than in Moto Racer 2. What's most noticeable is that we're now well deep into the days of Dreamcast and PS2, and the PlayStation's best graphics just don't look that good any more. But after I got over the whole PS-PS2 thing, the background graphics...well, they won't stun anyone. The perspective correction problem that many games have suffered in the past is here in full bloom, and there is a fair share of harsh looking sprites, stationery people and bland stuff objects. On the other hand, at least in the single-player mode, there is almost no pop-in at all, which is quite pleasing to the eye.   In the end the things that really shine in the graphics department really shine: highly articulated, highly animated racers, well-designed bikes, great framerates, and little pop-up. On the other hand you have an average looking PlayStation game that doesn't particularly bloom in any other aspect.   Sound The mix of guitar-laden rock and soft, but fast-paced grooves in this score is quite good, to be honest. At first, it seemed extremely boring and bland, but the more I listened to it, the more I liked it. These songs take time, but they're cool. This style of rock, ~racing rock,~ is a little reminiscent of R4, though World Tour's tracks pale in comparison. Perhaps it's just that I haven't heard a good soundtrack in about two months or so, playing the horrible lot of games I've been given, but I don't think so. This mellow rocking soundtrack is quite likeable.   As for the sound effects, I have to say there isn't much to recommend. The dirt bike sounds aren't much more than a hive of bees in a tizzy, and the street bike sounds aren't much more than two-levels squeals that don't vary more than low and high. This game is quite void of sounds, to be honest. I don't think there is an actual voice in it at all. It's been nearly three years since Delphine has delivered its last motorcycle game on PlayStation and I'm glad the company is back in action. I love this series. It's one that's always been about high quality, high speed, and great arcade fun. Although it seems the series has slipped a little since its heyday, the fact is the industry has simply moved on. What I would love to see is another Moto Racer, except this time for the PS2, with killer graphics, great speeds, and maybe even a four-player mode. Still, World Tour is filled with good variety, and good gameplay, and that's what it's all about. I don't think this is the best of the series, but with the Moto Racer engine at nearly top form in both street bikes races and in dirt bike races, I can only say that this ranks up there in the top five motorcycle games on the system. And that ain't bad.", "date": "Dec 21, 2000"}
