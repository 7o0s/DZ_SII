Milne's Winnie the Pooh characters may not be the hyper-cute otaku sugar-charged pika-puff-a-lump fad freaks that kids go wild for these days. With a unremittingly depressive donkey, a manic bi-polar rabbit, and a hyperactive tiger suffering from perpetual identity crisis, this troubled little band of friends hardly seems appropriate for children at all in this politically correct, sheltered society. But as most who grew up with Pooh and friends know, these friends are our friends too -- their flaws are their character.  NewKidCo, who haven't had the best reputation in dazzling young gamers (their Elmo games insulted even toddler's intelligence) have really started to turn their ways, and Tigger's Honey Hunt, which could have and should have been a disappointment to those who love to bounce along with the springy fellow, is a delightful surprise. Graphically enchanting and solid in play, it's a small title that's bigger than itself. Unfortunately, the gameplay is so quaint that it doesn't have much to offer beyond a few bounces, but that's certainly more than most games aimed at children ever achieve.  Gameplay Tigger's Honey Hunt is a plain and simple platformer. Poor Pooh has lost all of his hunney, and Tigger has volunteered to help him find it. Along the way, he'll jump over obstacles, climb trees, and bum-bounce on enemies. Every step is one Mario stomped a dozen years ago.  But sharp platforming sometimes isn't in doing everything new. It's in doing everything right. And when you're the player giving Tigger the calls to do what Tigger does best, it's quite fun. He springs off his tail, glides through the air, and snags onto branches like a... well, like a Tigger. It's all very easy, fluid, and enjoyable. Though Tigger isn't all himself right away -- he has to learn how to do special bounces -- young players are rewarded with new techniques and tricks all the time, so it never gets boring when you're playing with Tigger.  Depth of gameplay, however, is something that children's' games rarely deliver, and this one unfortunately comes up short as well. It's not surprising, of course, that the game has little to offer for bigger kids -- it's aimed at children 8 and younger... Who are we older kids to be greedy? But balance in overall gameplay is very key for a good children's' game. Young players should constantly be rewarded and pushed farther into play, and never discouraged for coming up short. The developers at Doki Denki did this very well in their last kids game, The Smurfs -- there was even an option to turn off the ability to lose a life or be physically hurt aside from a bump and a yelp, so determined little players would always have a chance to push towards the goal just as long as they never gave up. Tigger doesn't get that chance. When he comes up short, mean old Owl sends him back to do it all over again. Not that this is a hard game at all, but it's upsetting to lose when you could have just mustered up some courage and gone searching for those last few treasures.  Overall, also, the gameplay just isn't very exciting. It controls very well, but it never gets very far before its over. There are three minigames spread throughout, and they can be played with multiple other players as well on the main option screen, but they're not too entertaining. The blah river sticks game is no fun at all, the dancing game is just a simple round of Simon Says, and only Rock, Paper, Scissors is really challenging, if you could call it that. There's just not much that pops out or calls attention to itself, and with today's restless kids, there's not enough tactile stimulus to keep them playing.   Graphics Visually, on the other hand, Tigger's Honey Hunt is a tiny dazzler. The whole world looks like a water-colored children's' book, shaded in purples and oranges, tinted with delicate blues. Technically, it's not above breaking into pixels when too close, but its style is still perfect to represent the 100-Acre Woods. It's a wonderful look throughout, and something we rarely see in game design -- a subtle and light touch. So many games try to hit us over the head with colors and effects, but the designers wisely held back for a look that's classy and fitting.  Also, the animation of Tigger and friends is truly swell. Nothing at all is stiff about Tigger's spongy moves, as he prances and bounds from platform to platform. As a 2 1/2D game (a 2D platformer done with 3D graphics), depth of field and camera placement rarely cause troubles, but the motion of this game is still a superb credit. Occasionally, it slows down even when very little is happening on the screen, but since the pace is so relaxed, it's not much of a problem. And though some of the cartoonish effects (such as the arrows that leap up and spin around like mad bounders) aren't quite in keeping with the homesy Pooh style, the little visual flourishes like this certainly enliven an otherwise muted play experience.   Sound Authentic voice acting for each of the game's characters is one way of capturing young players' attention and encouraging them to keep playing. Synced to the game with real animation, Pooh and friends really look and sound alive. The audio tracks are, again, tastefully done soft but poppy kids music, rather than the frantic rave tracks that seem to dominate the gaming market. Also, as in the graphics, there are lots of 'sproings' and 'ba-OOO-gah~s in the audio that's too cartoon silly for Pooh, but since Tigger is such a lively and fun-spirited Tigger, I suppose he makes his own rules.   I know this sounds like the introduction to a bad Chris Gore article (and pardon me if you're too young to understand that -- I hope you never grow that old), but where on Earth did Doki Denki come from? Design and gameplay on children's' games are often stodgy, bland, stiff, and lifeless, so nobody in our office even cared to load up this game until somebody picked up by mistake. It was a wonderful mistake, revealing a game full of color, vibrancy, and dazzling animation.Yet it's still a very difficult balance, however, to create a game that can capture a child's interest. Eye candy and character life all trade back and forth in terms of importance with gameplay. The design team, who also created the kids game The Smurfs, come very, very close to getting over that line -- the control is very smooth even when working with the charming animation quality. Unfortunately, there's just not enough game here to recommend heartily. Tigger bounces from Point A to Point B looking for honey, occasionally stumbling on a mini-game to play with friends. He's a noble friend, but with such a bubbly guy, we'd like to see him hunt for more fun.", "date": "Nov 11, 2000"}
