{"name": "Rayman Arena", "name_review": "Rayman Arena", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/11/05/rayman-arena", "text": "There's an unwritten, but often exercised, law in the industry that states if a publisher creates a major franchise name it should be expanded into other properties. For example, we've seen Nintendo take Mario, one of the biggest videogame icons of all-time, and stretch his being into new games including Mario Party 4, Mario Tennis, and, on an even larger scale, Super Smash Bros. Melee, which includes many of the company's most popular characters. It is no surprise then that Ubi Soft has followed suit with its Rayman license. It's first major attempt to use the franchise to get other gameplay ideas recognized comes in the form of the battle-racer Rayman Arena. A very basic game from a design standpoint, Rayman Arena intends to be a party game more than anything, however it's often sluggish pace and bare simplicity hold it back from being anything but mediocre.  The Facts A spin-off battle/racing game based on the popular Rayman franchise Incorporates platform, battle, and race elements into one package Two main gameplay styles: Race and Battle Advance through and win the various Cup challenges, experiencing two difficulties: Beginner and Pro Battle uses an L-trigger lock-on mechanism to keep camera control intuitive Nine characters from the Rayman world Unlock new levels and multiple outfits/skins per character One to four players   Gameplay The only things ~Rayman~ about Ubi Soft's new battle-racing blend are the art style and characters. Sure the gameplay incorporates some platformer elements and a few moves you've seen in the previous Rayman adventures, but it's a completely different game. Arena, which sets out to be a simple pick-up-and-play party title, has two main modes of play: Battle and Race -- both of which can be experienced in single-player against an AI opponent. It's a very straightforward package that has inherently limited appeal. With so little features to build a foundation of gameplay on, it can only rely on the core mechanics to make it valuable; the addiction of returning again and again, in other words, is what would make Rayman Arena a worthwhile buy.   Like so many other franchise spin-offs before it, however, Arena is as elementary as it sounds. The Race mode, where you face off against a CPU opponent in single-player, has you running down linear, but branching pathways that are filled with obstacles, spring pads, and grappling hooks for swinging. The camera follows closely behind as you climb up vined walls, slide down icy paths, and even switches to a 2D-style at moments. It's pretty formulaic, but could have been more enjoyable if the controls and sensation of speed weren't docked at the starting line. There is a turbo function activated by tapping the Y-button at certain moments -- on boost pads, ice, water, etc. However, the execution of it is very generic and lacks any sort of momentum. The end result is the constant switching on and off of speed. Even with it, the Race mode suffers from sluggishness.   As for the controls in Rayman Arena, they borrow elements from the franchise including the ability to shoot balls of energy (tap the B-button) and to hover in the air (switch on and off by tapping A-button in mid-air). It's a pretty shallow system meant to keep focus on the racing, but without the speed the controls are a very clunky companion. It's a pretty shallow system and the deepest things get is where you are allowed to explore multiple tiers of the forward-moving levels by using a grappling hook of sorts to swing to new areas. It's only remotely satisfying, though, and often most of the enjoyment that is intended to be had is stifled by the level designs and aforementioned controls. Like many racing games, you have to memorize the paths and note shortcuts. That's fair enough, but the overall pace and raw feeling of playing the races is extremely dissatisfying.   It's the same for the Battle mode. The setup in that mode has you jumping around various environments, filled with gaps and platforms, shooting at one another. It employs an L-trigger lock-on system, no doubt inspired from the system first used in Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, which helps a lot to keep the camera frustrations at a minimum. The final ingredient to the mix is a varying set of weapons, which are randomly acquired by collecting the questions marks that litter the arenas. Outside of dodging behind platforms and hiding, there isn't much depth to the fighting. It's just as one-dimensional as the racing.   Both modes can, of course, be played in multiplayer with up to four players. One might presume that this party environment would encourage a more lively, entertaining atmosphere. Unfortunately, this really isn't the case. What it amounts to is multiple people partaking in shallow gameplay. The drive to win is all that can keep you going, and even then it gets old quickly.    So, what Rayman Arena amounts to is a pretty shallow attempt to exploit the Rayman brand name. It's mostly useful for a weekend rental for the younger audience. Even then the overall experience is really clunky and not very well through out. Lovers of Rayman, keep your eye out for the third installment of his true adventures. This isn't what you're looking for.  Graphics Arena seems to run on a subset of the Rayman 2 engine. It's runs at a pretty quick framerate with only occasional framerate trouble, and has a lot of the vibrant texture work you'd expect from the series. However, by GameCube standards it's pretty basic. There's just not a lot of texture detail, models are simple, and load times don't exactly encourage you to invest your time.   All in all, the engine still holds up, but it's clearly outdated, especially given the progress made in Rayman 3.   Sound The music tracks are a mixed bag of good and bad. On the one hand they can be a little too obvious and loud in style, but at other times it properly represents the simple and occasional 2D stylings the game has. Bleeps and blips are mixed into a more modern presentation for something genuinely listen-able depending on your tastes. On the sound effects side of things, because it's a party game, it's filled with a bunch of exaggerated samples to heighten the action. Characters will make specific sounds, as well, but there's nothing exceptional going on here. Eventually, as you would expect, the effects will wear thin in appeal. I love Rayman as an adventure and a platformer, but Ubi Soft's attempt to pull the wool over our eyes with a party game disguised in Rayman clothing is a poor one. If I had to speculate, I would guess that Ubi Soft first discussed using the Rayman license for other things, and then remembered it could use a party game. The result was Rayman Arena, but the execution is half-hearted and not remotely rewarding. It's not that Rayman Arena suffers from horrible gameplay design. The real problem is that there is just so little to it. The core gameplay mechanics, level design, and everything about the title is mostly superficial.It's an okay title for a rainy day or something you could play alongside some other party titles for variance, but I could only recommend renting it under these circumstances. And, even then, it's better suited for the younger audience, which won't be so quick to judge its clunkier controls and simple design.", "date": "Nov 5, 2002"}
