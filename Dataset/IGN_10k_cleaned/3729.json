It stormed into homes last May, kicked butt and took names. So, as any smart publisher, Activision took the success that was SOFII and brought it to a new audience in the hopes of cashing in on a good thing a second time. Does it matter that it's virtually a direct port of a year old PC game? Read on and find out.  Soldier of Fortune II highlights the tale of a soldier of fortune. John Mullins, a mercenary who takes contracts from a secret organization known as ~The Shop,~ eats terrorists for breakfast and humanity exterminating crises as a mid-afternoon snack. When some no good terrorists get scientific and develop a deadly virus they plan to unleash on the world, whom does the government call? Ghostbusters! Wait, they're reserved for marshmallow men. In case of biological agent wielding terrorists, the government relies on John Mullins. You play as John on a mission to put the hurt on world terror and stop their dastardly plan.  Gameplay Travel around the world to varying hot spots from the steamy tropical jungles of Columbia to the beautiful snowy mountains of Switzerland. See blood glisten on walls, floors, trees, rocks, trucks, or crates. Experience never before seen on Xbox death throes of terrorists. Witness all this and more in Activision's latest covert-ops romp, Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix.  Well, this elegant cruise, as Activision would have you believe, is a very straightforward shooter that transports you back to the days of Quake. You won't be facing ~intelligent~ enemies. There will be no need for tactical play. Instead, just run in with guns blazing to exterminate the terrorist threat. Sure there are stealth missions, but stealth is a suggestion rather than a requirement. This, in a nutshell, is what to expect from single player SOFII.  Spread over an overwhelming 54 missions, SOFII takes you to exotic locals like Prague, Columbia, Russia, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Texas, and New York. However, around half of these ~missions~ are really you wandering around some building trying to find a guy you need to talk to before seeing some action. While it breaks up the blood and guts game play enough to let you recover your sanity, these filler missions could have easily been incorporated into cut scenes.   Strategy Guide Available!

Get The Guide  Your real missions, which take around 25 seconds to load, are a variation of go in, find a guy/information/object and then escort it/escape without getting killed in the process. A couple missions ask that you be stealthy, but setting off alarms simply triggers an infinite supply of bad guys to chase after you instead of failing your mission.  While the missions aren't all that varied, they don't by themselves get tiresome, but you really only notice changes in missions when you're moving between outdoor and indoor settings. What does get tiresome is that most missions are like a big labyrinth. Any direction but the right one leads to a big fat dead end. You don't have a radar, which I think is good, but you also don't have a compass. Since entire levels look almost identical throughout the whole thing, complete with doors that say ~open me~ but don't open, you have to keep trudging down wrong ways until you find the sacred passage that leads to more live terrorists.    Two guns are better than one  When you finish the story mode, you can enjoy more single player action with the random map generator. The way this works is you pick what type of mission you want from your choices of Escape, Assassination, Infiltration, and Demolition. You also get to pick the type of  environment (desert, hills, jungle, or snow), night or day, difficulty, time limit, and your available inventory. Once you've done this, the game randomly generates a map, which takes even longer to load. However, even randomly generated maps are nothing all that spectacular and run into the same labyrinthine quality of the game.      At least the controls work. They're pretty standard FPS controls, move with the left analog stick, aim with the right, A jumps, X reloads, Y uses items, B switches between primary weapon and grenades, R fires your weapon, white changes firing mode, black and clicking in the left stick makes you crouch, and clicking in the right stick turns on night vision. The directional pad is your weapons hub. Down cycles through weapons. Up will call up the weapons menu where you highlight the weapon you want with the left analog stick and then click R to select it. Left and right on the D-pad leans you in the appropriate direction. You also have the option to invert aim, switch to south paw controls, and decide between a couple preset button layouts.  In the process of mowing down endless bad guys, you'll be happy to know that you do have quite a selection  of weapons in your arsenal. You've got knives, grenades, handguns, rifles, shotguns, explosives, and rocket launchers. Not all of this is available to you at once, rather you have to choose all your weaponry before you head out on a mission (personal weapon, primary, secondary, grenade type, and a tool). As you progress through the game, your options become more varied. If you choose poorly and end up facing enemies packing heat you wantpick it up off their room temperature, oozing, disappearing corpses.  Realism SOFII claims that it's the most realistic covert-ops shooter experience ever created. If by realistic they mean that when you unleash a shotgun into someone's head it explodes, arms and legs can be ripped off of bodies by bullets, or you can slash away at alive or dead bodies to your heart's content, then yes, this is a realistic shooter. If by realistic you mean that when you shoot a guy he doesn't flinch and immediately return fire, but instead will take time to recover, limp around, or drop his weapon, then this is realistic. If by  realistic you mean that shooting someone actually kills them or that enemies aren't stupid, then keep looking.  The AI in this game has some serious alertness problems. It's possible to run up behind someone, slash at his back, miss, and he won't even turn around. You can run up behind another guy, knife him in the throat, watch as he falls down dead in front of his buddy, and that baddie won't even notice his comrade is dead. You can even shoot at a lone terrorist, miss, and watch as he keeps walking and doesn't start running around trying to find you until 5 seconds later. I have even walked up in front of someone and counted to 5 before he started to react.  Aiming is also sporadic at best. It's possible to shoot someone in the head and have him not die. I drilled one guy in the chest with three bullets, but he kept walking towards me. I then shot him twice in the head (and this was at close range), his reaction was to crouch down and start shooting at me until I finally took out a shotgun and blasted him properly. At another point, I blatantly missed a headshot, and the bullet hole appeared in the wall next to the guy's head, yet he mysteriously died.  How am I ever going to get that stain out?   You'll also encounter a lot of scripted events where bad guys will knock over tables, automatically throw smoke grenades, and burst out of doors. My favorite is when you decide to use a certain machine gun emplacement. As soon as you touch the gun, terrorists suddenly start pouring out of buildings like cockroaches, yet if you don't touch the gun you never have to deal with them. On a side note, terrorists also tend to blow themselves up a lot when they attempt to throw grenades at you.     Multiplayer SOFII's one saving grace is multiplayer. It's not anything new, it doesn't really offer anything different, but multiplayer can at least be fun. Up to twelve soldiers of fortune can battle in free-for-all or team style play over Xbox Live or System Link. You have twenty maps at your disposal, a wide range of weapons, and six multiplayer modes. Multiplayer includes Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Elimination, Demolition, and Infiltration. Demolition and Infiltration are both variations of CTF. Demolition has one team trying to plant a bomb and the other team defending the bomb site by either killing the other team or defusing the bomb. In Infiltration, one team is trying to steal a briefcase and bring it back to their base while the other is trying to defend it.  Graphics What was a decent looking PC game a year ago does an ugly Xbox game make. The outdoor environments look like Ghost Recon whereas the indoor environments are reminiscent of the Goldeneye days. You'll notice a pattern of backgrounds being bland regurgitations of one another. Draw distance is very limited. Everything is chunky. In other words, this game doesn't shine.  I swear, in each mission there are, at most, two different enemy character models. These guys aren't particularly graceful in their movements, but rather rigid. The one thing they do have going for them is that they like to blow apart fairly easily. Heads, arms, and legs can all be detached from someone's body with enough ammo. Bone will stick out of leg and arm remnants, and blood generously flows out of bodies. The blood, however, is a bit too bright and too shiny to fit in with the rest of the game's graphics since it looks like spilt paint.  Collision detection is another rather large problem with SOFII. It's not unusual for terrorists to pass through ~solid~ objects as they crumple to the ground, and later curl up like paper so that when they finally stop falling they aren't resting inside something. Bullets, arms, guns, and heads can also be seen passing through walls or doors.   Your window will no longer save you  With the horrendous loading times come noticeable moments of slowdown. It's not really clear what causes it because it doesn't normally happen when there are big explosions or you're switching areas. Occasionally, you'll notice it when there are a lot of bad guys on screen, but usually it's for no apparent reason at all.     Sound The sound effects aren't too bad in Soldier of Fortune. They do, however, get recycled a lot. Of note are your accursed footsteps that tend to drown out most other noises. I guess they're so loud so that you can tell when you're being ~stealthy.~ After playing through half the game, you're about ready to amputate your feet. The gargling sound of someone getting shot in the throat also gets pretty repetitive. The first couple times it happens, it's the sort of a novelty you'd expect from this gratuitous game, but it, surprisingly, grows old rather quickly.  Guns sound like guns. Loud explosions accompany grenades. Shooting metal results in a pinging sound while wood makes the sound of wood being shot. Usually, you can hear guards talking as you sneak up on them, which gives you a heads up if you aren't being particularly wary of your surroundings. There are other background noises like chirping insects at night and other such things to keep you aurally occupied if you have the sound turned up loud enough.  There isn't really a musical score per se. The few times you can actually distinguish one from the flood of background aural presence is when you are in the in between missions wandering around ~The Shop.~ These orchestral pieces, if you can call them that, are pretty average elevator caliber tunes. Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix was a good game on PC. This sloppy port is not so great on the Xbox. When you have Halo and Ghost Recon in your library, theres little reason to spend $50 bucks on a very average shooter with sub-standard Xbox graphics. The only reason anyone should consider getting this game for the single player mode is if they crave gratuitous violence. If flying body parts is your thing then this is the game for you. If you dont live or die by gore, pass this one by.SOFIIs only saving grace is that it does have multiplayer on Xbox Live. This is fun, there are a variety of modes, and you get to unleash slice enemies and friends to your hearts content. However, this game doesnt really offer any multiplayer modes that you cant find in other FPS titles, so again, only get into this game for the gore.", "date": "Jun 19, 2003"}
