Naturally, the sequel would give the mobile maker another opportunity to drink from the same well, but in a very pleasant surprise, the developer did not just re-skin the previous top-down racer. Instead, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a 3D-esque racer that actually provides a decent sense of speed.   Mercifully, 2 Fast 2 Furious doesn't follow the lame sequel's plot at all. Instead, developers focused strictly on the street racing and car customization scene in Miami. You are an up-n-coming street racer new to the area. In order to prove yourself, you must race twelve different tracks, earning cash and respect along the way. Cash is used to either buy upgrades for your whip or entrance fees to a new race.   Depending on how to finish during a race, you earn more or less cash. Some of the entrance fees get pretty pricey, so you may find yourself replay past circuits to pad your wallet. Fortunately, entrance fees are one-time expenses. Once you open up a track, it stays open, even if you burnout on your first run. That is one of the game's strongest points -- while you are handsomely rewarded for winning, the game doesn't beat you up too bad (2 bad?) for crapping out.   The garage is definitely a little more limited than, say, EA's Need for Speed Underground upgrade system -- but it still has some meat for mobile. You can buy enhancements for your engine, acceleration, steering, and body. And, what street racer would be complete without the inclusion of nitrous -- or NOS, a term we actually hope to never hear again.   Once you are down furiously shopping, it's back to the circuit. Digital Bridges' new 3D engine runs remarkably smooth -- we downloaded the game on a new LG VX8000 and were impressed by the scaling effects. Roadside attractions whizz by the car, really giving you a sense of moving at a decent clip. The tracks are loaded with curves as well as dips and inclines, none of which seem to tax the game at all. Older games will be reminded of the seminal racing classic Out Run from time to time.   The tracks are never loaded with cars, but the few rides you do share the road with provide plenty of competition. There doesn't seem to be any cheap rubberband AI -- it's just that the other racers are good and will stay on your caboose if you race too conservatively or skid out, which happens of you try to lay on a turn too long while going too fast. (2 Long 2 Fast!)   The controls are very simple. The game does not auto-accelerate for you, which is a blessing. Instead you must press up on the pad to juice the car. Pressing down on the pad slows you down, a feature you best not forget on some of the more winding courses. You cannot just go full bore the whole time or you will blow a very of the sharper corners. Nitrous is attached to the ~5~ key.   Digital Bridges proves its experience in mobile gaming by the length of the races. They don't derive their challenge by being overly long, making them a chore to run between classes or bus stops. Instead, you get great little two-minute bites of intense racing action that can be enjoyed across multiple play sessions. 2 Fast 2 Furious also has a minor online mode where you can post your best times to a scoreboard.   2 Fast 2 Furious looks quite good. As mentioned, the scaling and 3D techniques are solid. But the use of color is also fantastic, best seen when the game approximates a Miami sunset. The car models also look pretty good, if not a little homogenous. The sound effects could use a little work, though. The brakes sound more like aggressive bird chirping than a satisfying squeal.  2 Fast 2 Furious is a solid racing game for mobile -- much more improved than Digital Bridges last racing outing, the frustrating Colin McRae Rally. The 3D-esque scaling tech looks good and the color use makes the game a pleasure to look down at. Twelve tracks give the game lots of play value, especially since you will likely re-race on several of them to earn extra flow. The control is rarely a problem, and when it is, it's more because the game is stuck using out-dated tech (eight-way thumb pads -- please). You will get frustrated, but with practice, you can learn your way around it. While not as good as Gameloft's Asphalt racer, 2 Fast 2 Furious is a close second and deserves attention when it appears on your game deck.", "date": "Mar 20, 2005"}
