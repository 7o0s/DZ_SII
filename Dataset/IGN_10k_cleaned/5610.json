{"name": "Small Soldiers", "name_review": "Small Soldiers", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/11/12/small-soldiers", "text": "Released with perfect timing to coincide with the video release, Small Soldiers is finally available for the PlayStation.  But don't expect a conversion of the movie -- the PlayStation game is not based on the plot of the movie. Instead, the designers took the idea of what the Commandos and Gorgonites are and placed them in the environment they were ~designed~ for...much like reading the background story of the characters on the back of the action-figure packaging. So, if you're looking to run, blast and shoot in an oversized real-life world like in the film, you're not going to get it.  What you are going to get, though, is a very Tomb Raider-esque game where you assume the role of the Gorgonite's leader, Archer (the noble, lion-looking creature from the movie). The Commandos have infiltrated the Gorgon homeworld, and it's up to you (as Archer) to clean out these war-hungry soldiers from the face of your planet.  Using Archer, you can run, jump, use his blaster, and climb up on ledges to get though the game's 14 levels. You'll also need to rescue other Gorgonites captured in the game  free them and they'll help you destroy the enemies. But they're not invincible, so you'll need to watch their backs as well as yours.  Small Soldiers also features two two-player modes, frag mode and flag mode. The screen is seperated into two, one player controls Archer, the other plays as Chip Hazard (that Tommy Lee Jones character from the flick). In frag mode, you just run around the levels trying to kill the other player five times. In flag mode, you'll need to grab three flags thrown about the level while avoiding getting killed by the opponent. I thought the movie was rather stale, but the PlayStation rendition holds a bit more merit. The game plays like a faster-paced Tomb Raider game, but without a lot of the puzzle solving. But because of the loose controls you'll be spending much of the game fighting with the character  He can run fast but his turning speed is rather sluggish, making for a slightly unbalanced feel.The 3D engine is rather good, but lacks any of the fluff (like lightsourcing, reflections, shadowing) that makes the game look like it's pushing the system hardware. Still, it's doing the job, and despite the occasional texture drop-out there's not much to complain about. The music is a pleasant surprise  the orchestrations with the Gregorian-style chanting really fits the game's (and the characters') atmosphere.Just like the movie, the game isn't exactly targeted to little kids, it just looks that way. The game isn't the easiest game out there, but it isn't tremendously difficult, either. It's got a nice balance in gameplay, but the lack of control tweaking brings our rating down a notch.", "date": "Nov 12, 1998"}
