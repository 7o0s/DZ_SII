Sure there are some that come along every now and again that add something new and manage to be fun, but there are just too many that are pretty much exactly the same as what came before them, only with a couple of new gimmicks and a prettier engine. Ooooh pretty... can I play something else now? One example of such a game is today's lucky participant, Dark Planet: Battle for Natrolis. While it has some good qualities, it was a whole lot of the same with a bunch of strange control decisions that made me angry.   First off, the atmosphere behind the game is virtually non-existent. You have these three races battling on a planet, right? Apparently the humans came to rape the planet of its resources, the Sorin are a magical race that lives on the planet and are trying to defend it against the Humans, and the Dreil were some nasty little critters sleeping peacefully until the war between the Humans and the Sorin woke them up inciting the biggest breakfast feast in the history of the universe. While this sounds like it could make an interesting story, it doesn't. Why? The story is barely told. You're just dropped into the middle of the fracas after everything has already begun. You never feel attached to what's going on... there's no progression of story really... there are no characters to care about... and the only little bit of story you get that makes you think you're attached to anything bigger than a pissing contest are the briefings for the missions.   The campaigns themselves don't help anything. Where in a game like StarCraft (a good example in this case due to the races) you had the progression of the story in three separate and different campaigns, Dark Planet sends you through a campaign where the missions have little to no connection to each other aside from the fact that they all take place on Natrolis. And here's the real kicker that just irks me. They're all the same campaigns. You'll just have to play through the same missions with each different race. The maps are the same. The objectives are the same (aside from some terminology being switched around). The only thing different is that you play with and against different races. Lame. Lame. Lame.   I didn't want to play through the same missions three times. There's no suspense. You already know where everything is and what you're going to have to do to beat it. It'll just take a minor change in tactics to complete missions occasionally. I can't even tell you how boring that is to me.   The only thing keeping any atmosphere or interest in the game is the beautiful 3D engine. Units, environments, textures, and special effects are all colorful and well done throughout the game. It all blends together pretty well. Natrolis is just alien enough to give the feel that the battles are taking place on a different planet. The lighting and special effects in the game are some of the best I've seen to date in an RTS with plenty of flair to keep you interested in seeing more explosions.   The only problem actually comes with everything being detailed and colorful strangely enough. Some units tend to blend together and get lost in the mix of a big battle so that you really can have a hard time controlling where your units attack and what they're doing. This is a bigger problem for the Sorin and Dreil where I got my workers mixed up in a battle all too often because they blended into the armies so well. I had this problem once before with Far Gate. When things get crazy enough with almost cartoony and bright characters, things tended to blend together.   Which is really too bad because the amount of detail that went in to some of the models is really amazing. On the other hand, animations could be hit and miss. Take the Human marine. Whenever he fires his stupid rifle, he rocks back like a gumby doll with its feet stuck to the ground. With so much technology and units that look vaguely like the hardcore warriors in Warhammer 40,000, you would figure they would plant their feet and empty some machine gun rounds into the enemy. Then you have the Digins on the Dreil side that are detailed enough that you actually see their little mouths open up and bite the enemy when they attack. It goes like that through the game. This one looks cool... that one looks goofy...    Actual gameplay suffers from some strange decisions that I just can't wrap my brain around. The one that made the vein in my forehead start to pulse the most was the grouping system. It works a lot like you've become used to with every other RTS except in one way. Every time you want to call up a group by hitting a number key associated with the group, it centers on them automatically. Not after two hits, just one. So if you have your units all set up and ready to attack on the outskirts of town, or you want to move several groups across the map, you're going to have to go through some frustration to get everyone where they're going. Hit 1 and it centers on group 1. Pan back to the place you want them to go (because clicking on the mini-map does nothing, another sad motardation) and send them there. Then hit 2 to select group number 2, which will take the camera all the way back to the group. Then pan the camera all the way back to where you want them to go and click... you get the picture. It's fairly frustrating having to select everything and have them walk over some where in a big clump, especially if you want groups to attack a bunch of different targets at the same time.   Now for more frustrations, this time with the camera system. With a game like this one with a full 3D engine with plenty of height differences in the terrain and forests and the like, you have to be able to move the camera from the default position. I had mentioned to the folks at Ubi Soft after I played the last preview build that I hoped Edgies would include a mouse controlled camera. Well they did. It's just not very good. As of now, you can control the rotation only of the camera while holding down the right mouse button. No tilt that way, you'll need to map it to something comfortable for you because the page up and insert keys just don't cut it. The real problem is that you can't rotate the camera with the mouse if you have any units selected. So the easy route becomes not so easy all the sudden. I ended up leaving the camera in a view that was pretty close to straight above the action because of this so I didn't have to rotate the camera ever, which isn't really how I would have liked it.   If it wasn't for most of those problems I stated above, Dark Planet might be a pretty decent game. Each of the races is made up differently to have certain strengths and weaknesses even though they aren't totally apparent at first. The Humans have more ranged units and generally are faster to die. The Sorin have a lot of close combat and have a nice bit of magic to boot. And the Dreil have a nice mix of both.  What did you think about Dark Planet: Battle for Natrolis? They each need different resources and the Sorin and Dreil need some that aren't natural exhaustible resources on the planet. Each of the races has tons of upgrades, which can be a little daunting because of the interface. Telling what level they're at and making sense of things is difficult at the beginning and even after you've gotten used to the icons. If they were organized a little better within the buildings, it would be nice. But even with all of that stuff, it's not really anything that's really going to jump out and grab you for the most part. My favorite unit of the game, the Sand Whale, is actually just a transport...    The game also includes features like leaders and formations to organize and boost your armies, but they don't seem to work so well. Having leaders around didn't noticeably improve my troops and formations didn't see to matter one way or another except for organization and protecting a single unit with the circle formation.   I can't say I really had a lot of fun playing Dark Planet for a bunch of reasons. It's a very average game shoved into a very pretty body. Sure that may work to persuade me when it comes to women, but playing games is a little different. Especially when billions of real-time strategy games are released each year. At this point you've got to have something that will leave gamers feeling more attached to their situations via a story or RPG style characters like in Warlords: Battlecry. When there's enough control issues and otherwise pretty standard fare in the package, there's bound to be some disappointed consumers.  I'll be blunt. I didn't like this game. It isn't horrible. It has a nice engine and enough variation of units to keep some gamers occupied for a while, but I just didn't care to be. It bored me a bit. Without any real history or story behind the factions fighting, I just felt kind of disjointed the entire time I was playing. This is not the world of one night stands, I need more than a pretty face and the standard features to keep me interested for longer. Speaking of which, I still can't believe that the campaigns are all the same. When you advertise three campaigns... they really should be different.The controls need some work. Some of the issues are just annoying and frustrating and ended up making me bring my armies in a big messy clump everywhere to battle instead of thinking tactically on the fly with precision and well timed attacks. Aesthetically pleasing but tactically boring (and some times barren) maps don't help the situation either. If the game had played as good as it looked... but it didn't.", "date": "Mar 14, 2002"}
