At times, you can see them coming from miles away, other times, you slowly work into in, liking the experience more and more as you play. There are times, however, when a good game just jumps up and bites you right on the arse, and lets you -- scratch that -- forces you to really enjoy it. Vanark is, in many respects, that type of game. It came completely from left field, with no PR or industry buzz, and demonstrates what a developer with a good, strong understanding of the PlayStation hardware can accomplish.    Gameplay Vanark is, at its core, a shooter. Sure, it's a 3D shooter ~on rails~ in the grand tradition of Star Fox or the Saturn's Panzer Dragoon series, but the difference here, is that it's the PlayStation's first great example of one. It's a tried-and-true method of laying on the action, and while there were plenty of opportunities for Asmik to screw up the formula, but luckily, they never really dropped the ball, at least not when it came to the shooter parts.   Before I launch into the praises that will most certainly flow as I discuss the pure 3D-shooter elements, I do need to digress a little for the ~story~ portion of Vanark. While the shooter elements are fantastic, even amazing in parts, the way Asmik has decided to move along the story is pretty lame. Before and after each mission, you're forced to wander aimlessly about your ship, trying to find someone who will either provide a plot vehicle for the next mission (i.e. She/he knows some vital info about the next mission, someone wants to join up, etc.). It wouldn't be so bad if there was more to it than just shuffling from room to room, searching for someone to talk to.   Other than the aforementioned rather distracting Resident Evil-esque departures from the usual shooter gameplay, Vanark rocks. There's not a whole lot to explain, story wise, but I'll try. The battles take place on or in Mars. (Yeah, I said in. There are entire levels where you have to scream through tight tunnels, and over molten lava. There's even a section of the level where the two combine, as rising magma shoots up a tunnel behind you.) This is done because a cataclysmic explosion on Earth has left Mars as the only (barely) habitable planet. Unfortunately, a rather large section of Mars is controlled by a mysterious group that is trying to destroy not only Mars itself, but possibly the whole universe. All attempts to launch an offensive directly at the Mars base have met with little asteroids being hucked from the asteroid belt (yeah, that asteroid belt) at the large fleets. So, in classic shooter form, it's decided that a small one- or two-ship offensive will be able to sneak under the enemy's skin and destroy it piece by piece. Thus begins the quest of Team Vanark. (See, now you know where the name came from, so don't say we never teach you anything here.)   Before the actual action, though, you're given the opportunity to pick a co-pilot, each excelling in one area, be it enemy detection, combat experience, route detection, or just good ol' combat ability. After that, you pick your center (homing), and side (regular rapid-fire beam) weapons, from what becomes a bevy of destruction-dealing goodness towards the end of the game. Once you've confirmed everything, it's off to the mission.   Once you actually enter flight, it's easy to get accustomed to the controls. The ship you fly is quite agile, and while you're still on rails, and forced to fly only in the predetermined paths, the distance you can fly in those paths is pretty far. Enemies range from full-on robotic style, to varyingly animal-like designs. Like every good shooter, there's a mini boss halfway through the level, and a final boss. Some levels are just plain brilliant. Case in point: early in the game, your ship is forced to dive underwater to avoid a barrage of incoming bombs. Even after you've dove under, though, the action doesn't let up, and in fact, you're treated to a whole new group of enemies, all water-based. After a brief swim, you'll pop back up above water and continue the fight. It's all so slick and looks so amazing, that I was instantly hooked.   Level designs are fantastic, and all follow some sort of theme, whether it's a marshy jungle, or a pseudo-Greece (where you take the trip under water), all of the missions are rife with immerse detail. Small things, like palm trees and thick fern-like plants coupled with decidedly alien flora on the first level, and the crumbling remnants of an ancient copycat civilization that suffered the same fate of Atlantis are perfect examples of the fantastic amount of detail put into these levels.   Graphics What's actually kind of interesting about Vanark is, for one reason or another, the game doesn't look like anything special -- initially. My theory is the rather blah color palette on the first level that hits you with the impression that this game will end up becoming another $40 coaster or finely-tuned dust collector. However, an odd thing happens about 30 seconds into the new game: it just starts to look good. The more you pay attention to the texture work and simple, yet well done enemy designs, the more you just start to like the game. And the beauty of it all is that it just keeps getting better the more you play.    The texture detail is fantastic, if a little grainy. For the most part, though, it's all done really, really well. Some textures boast a rather limited color palette, so some banding and pixelation are apparent, but only up close. And when you're whizzing by them at breakneck speeds, it won't matter anyway. Lighting is present, but not much. For the most part, you'll see very little in the way of special effects, since most of the more intricate graphical scenes are done with CG movies.   Speaking of the movies, Vanark uses some pretty impressive CG. It's not Square or Namco quality by any means, but it never feels like it was thrown in at the last minute, either. The movies can range from the massive opening to simple animations like your character dropping into his ship. It's something that could have been done in game, but fortunately, it wasn't. More detailed and frankly beautiful scenes were done justice with the movies.   What's more surprising about the graphics isn't really the texture work anyway, it's the variety of environments you'll find, and the diversity from one to another. It's nice to see that this close to the end of the PlayStation's life there are still developers out there that can craft games that are as pretty to look at as they are to play. Vanark doesn't exactly push the PlayStation to it's limits (or at least it doesn't seem that way), but it does offer everything visual at a smooth 30fps, without a hint of slowdown. Popup was also almost unnoticeable, since Vanark draws in objects much like Ace Combat 3 did, by large sections that are quickly faded in. Obviously, this is more noticeable in the canyon-like levels than out in space, but it's not horrible.   Small things, like the shafts of light reaching down into the murky depths of the Martian Ocean on the previously mentioned level, show that Asmik cares enough to add small things. One of the more interesting ways that they added some life to the Resident Evil-type CG stills was to simply animate the lights. I don't mean blinking on and off, but merely using the game's engine to light certain parts of the screen with a glow. It's not an amazing effect, but it does serve to make the sterile, static screens a little more dynamic.    Sound Vanark's music and effects aren't stunning, however. They're usually canned booms and bleeps, and when your character is running around, it's the same lame metallic clomp-clomp that haunts the Resident Evil games. There's no voice acting (thank God, since this game's English translation was bad enough as it is), and for tHere's the bottom line: Vanark promises nothing, and delivers almost everything one could want in a shooter. In a time of mega-hyped crap and over-exposed drivel, Vanark's gameplay speaks softly and carries one big @$$ stick. Gorgeous visuals thanks to some welcome graphics diversity, great control, and a few surprises make this one of the year's biggest and most pleasant surprises. If you're even a bit of a fan of the shooter genre, you owe it to yourself to check this game out.", "date": "Apr 27, 2000"}
