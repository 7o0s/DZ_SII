Picky gamer that I am, Wipeout 3 is the reason I still own a PlayStation. After a sleepless night of playing the game, I can definitely say I'm glad that gray box is still sitting under my TV.   The first thing you need to know about Wipeout 3 is that it isn't so much a sequel as it is a distilled version of Wipeout XL. In fact, switching from Wipeout XL to Wipeout 3 is a very similar experience to switching from the first Wipeout to XL. The graphics are sharper, the control more precise, and the game design a touch better defined than in its predecessor, but it's essentially the same game.  Gameplay Control in Wipeout 3 is the gameplay element that has received the most attention, with the biggest change being support for the PlayStation Dual Shock analog controller. You always could play Wipeout with the NegCon or the dual joysticks, but neither controller actually delivered a control system that really fit the game. Lets face it, the game's control was designed perfectly around the PlayStation controller's shoulder buttons and right hand buttons and now with the built in support for the Dual Shock, players can finally get the precision control that N64 Wipeout players enjoyed. The left analog stick controls the nose of the craft, and while players could always use the D-pad to raise or lower the nose for tighter cornering, it is much easier now with the analog stick, making Wipeout's suicide corners less risky at higher speeds.   Wipeout 3 also makes excellent use of the feedback aspect of the dual shock controller. You can actually feel it when your ship bumps up against another craft or scrapes a wall.   Racing itself hasn't really changed at all since XL. The game is still frighteningly fast, you still slow down and lose energy if you brush the walls, and the opponent AI is brutal. The tracks also still offer hairpin curves, steep drop-offs, jumps and ramps, and now more branching. What has changed in the eight new circuits is the learning curve. The initial tracks are the easiest courses in Wipeout history, enabling newcomers to get used to the game's dynamics. In previous Wipeout titles, the game would go from difficult to impossible in just a few tracks, but WO3 has a gradual curve, with the expert courses at the top.   Wipeout 3 introduces a number of changes to the lineup of craft and some new weapons. The five racing teams from XL have made the transition so you can still race as AG Systems, Feisar, Auricom, Qirex and Pirhana, but you can also race one of the new teams, Icaras, Assagai Developments and GoTeki 45. While each team has a different speed/maneuverability profile, they also follow a gentle tradeoff curve so it is easy to find a ship that matches a player's ability.   The new weapons are sure to excite players as well. Seven old weapons are in the game, though tweaked plenty, in addition to the five new ones. Old standbys like mines and auto-pilot are here, as is the quake disruptor and the rocket, but the best new weapon is easily energy drain, which locks onto the nearest craft and siphons its power to your ship's shield energy. Siphon long enough and you'll destroy the opponent's ship.  Psygnosis also has added some new playing modes to the game that add quite a bit to the replay value. It still has the familiar Tournament mode with Vector, Venom and Rapier class races, but you can now also play Eliminator and Weapon challenge modes that are as close to a deathmatch in a racing game as you are likely to find. The weapon challenge tasks you with gunning down a number of ships on a timed course. Eliminator, which is much more interesting, has you racing for points. You get a point for each completed lap and for each destroyed enemy. The first craft to reach a target score wins.   Fans of Wipeout and XL's linked multiplayer modes will mourn the change in Wipeout 3's new multiplayer mode, but gamers without an extra TV, PlayStation, and copy of the game (i.e. most of you) will actually be able to race each other now. Wipeout 3 offers split screen racing at reasonably high frame rates and with pretty good image quality. It doesn't compare to two linked PlayStations, but it's definitely a nice addition.  Graphics The Wipeout series is known for three things. Its blinding speed, the soundtrack, and it's Designers Republic graphic design. Fortunately, it is still fast as hell and the folks at DR have out done themselves.   All of the craft have been touched up and the new ones just look fantastic, with highly detailed models. The tracks now have much more immersive environments, so it actually feels like there is a living, breathing city surrounding you during the race. The craft's contrails now act as light sources on the surrounding environments, so a ship's blue streak will color the walls of a tunnel. The effect is dramatic, especially when you have ships with a number of different colored contrails in a tunnel.   Even the interface has received a massive overhaul, subscribing to Designers Republic's new austere design aesthetic. Although there is substantially less eye candy in the menu system, it makes for quick loading screens and easy navigation.   For the first time Wipeout is also running in High Resolution mode, so the courses, ships and effects are all stunning. Even Wipeout XL running in 3D acceleration mode on Bleem doesn't look this good.  Sound The soundtrack and sound effects are an important part of the Wipeout experience, and like everything else about this game, Wipeout 3 just refines what was already great about the first two. The basic sound effect set is strong, and is similar to the previous games, with the whine of the ship's engines and the grinding of scraped walls delivering appropriate audio feedback.  The soundtrack was put together by music director DJ Sasha. Under his direction, groups like Orbital, Propellerheads, The Chemical Brothers, and Underworld have all contributed to the score with edgy electronic mixes that make the game's adrenaline pumping speed feel that much faster.The bottom line with this game is that it brings more to the table, it's faster and better. Newcomers and Wipeout fans alike are going to be all over it.", "date": "Sep 25, 1999"}
