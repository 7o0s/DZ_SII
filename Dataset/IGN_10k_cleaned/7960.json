The power of Pac-Man owned the arcade scene, opening the doors for more of the company's creative efforts to make their debuts  games like the racing maze chase Rally-X, the swarm-shooting bug blaster Galaga, and this title, Xevious. Developed and programmed by designer Masanobu Endoh, Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter that held an innovative and inventive vision when it arrived in the arcades of 1982.   It was a double vision  the action in Xevious takes place on two parallel planes, with enemies assaulting your starfighter both in the air and from the ground. Well, your ship probably isn't a starfighter. Xevious is landscape-based, unlike other shooters that feature only empty fields of stars for their environments. Your vehicle then, the Solvalou, is more likely a sophisticated jet, equipped to attack in two different ways.   The first is straight ahead. A basic forward-firing zapper can be rapidly shot with a quick trigger finger, laying waste to enemy aerial aces entering the arena from above. The second is a blaster  a targeting reticule floats ahead of your ship a ways, serving to help you line up drops of your air-to-surface bombs. Success in Xevious comes through balancing your offense between foes from above and below, and defensively dodging the projectiles launched at you from both directions.   Xevious has something of a fan following here in the States, though more of one exists in Japan  as a scrolling shooter that pre-dated a lot of the other classic scrolling shooters, it's easy to see why it found the audience it did. Xevious was ported to several home platforms in the '80s, each of which had to make sacrifices in adapting the arcade version. The coin-op cabinet used a taller-than-wide vertical monitor, so console versions had to reframe the action to fit wider screens. Namco's team took care in bring their work to the NES, though, making sure the translation came through as well as possible  and it's that same NES version that we now find here, emulated for the Virtual Console.   Unfortunately for Xevious, it's timing isn't as good now as it was in the '80s  it's debuting on a download service already replete with more advanced, quality offerings in the scrolling shooter genre, and even hardcore fans of the category are probably getting burned out after the stacked releases of Super Star Soldier, R-Type and Gradius. Nostalgic arcade, NES and Atari 7800 players may well seek this one out to own once again, but Xevious' more casual pace of play and age of design make it less of an attractive option for new Solvalou recruits.  Xevious came to the Game Boy Advance a few years ago as part of the Classic NES Series, and gamers who were skilled enough to score silver medals in every mission found that it was also an unlockable extra in the Namco-developed GameCube game Star Fox Assault. Here on the Wii it's priced at the standard 500 points, and it clocks it at a general rating of ~fair~ on the scale of worthiness of purchase. Fans of Namco specifically may want to support this download, though, for another reason  it's the first game to hit the VC from the company, and good sales numbers on Xevious may mean more goods from the House of Pac in the future.", "date": "Jan 24, 2007"}
