{"name": "NFL GameDay", "name_review": "NFL Gameday", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/25/nfl-gameday", "text": "For die hard sports fans, there's nothing quite like a really excellent sports sim. NFL Gameday is, essentially, a football fan's wet dream. It has all the players, teams, stadiums, stats, and injuries of the real deal, certainly enough realism to keep even the most dedicated fan involved.  The graphics are superb. The players are well-animated with relatively detailed uniforms, and the field and stadium are done perfectly - in other words, exactly what you'd expect from a great 32-bit machine. Control is exquisite. On the offense, you can run, dive, spin, hurdle, juke left and right, and stiff arm left and right. On defense you can switch players, dive, jump, forearm bash left or right, and swim left or right.  The playbooks are large enough to keep you occupied and excited. The defensive AI lets you read the safeties before making a deision on a pass, and the running game is also done well. The game's only flaw comes in the passing game - when tipping a passed ball, the ball has a tendency to careen wildly away. Sure this happens occasionally in the NFL, but not all the time. Barring this one factor, it's a great sports game.", "date": "Nov 25, 1996"}
