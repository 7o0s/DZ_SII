Given the power to travel through time, who wouldn't want to go hang out with some of history's most famous figures? Spend an hour with Gandhi, have lunch with old Abe Lincoln  but, even better, why not bring those long-gone celebrities together and have them fight to the death? That's the concept for World Heroes, a Neo Geo fighter that builds its brawling roster from characters based on actual historical icons. It's an idea that's just a bit derivative from the plot of the Excellent Adventure, but then you'll come to find that that's the standard for this title.   Derivativeness, that is. World Heroes has always been seen as something of a rip-off, because it was one of the first head-to-head versus fighters to hit the arcade scene after Capcom's Street Fighter II. And it's an opinion that's not unfounded  there are several striking similarities between the two titles, starting off with the character select screen.   The main hero, Hanzo, is accompanied by a near clone of himself in red clothes named Fuuma. Just like Street Fighter's main hero, Ryu, is accompanied in that game by a near clone of himself in red clothes named Ken. There's only one woman in the lineup (like Chun Li), there's a crazed Russian character with massive grab attacks (like Zangief), there's another guy whose arms and limbs stretch out to attack his foes (like Dhalsim) and your character flies around a map screen of the Earth to take on different fighters in different cities around the globe ... there's just a lot of similarity in presentation here, and anyone who's spent time playing the Street Fighter titles will notice it immediately.     But they'll also notice that World Heroes, for all its copying, doesn't manage to accurately knock off the flow and feel of Capcom's classic. The gameplay here is not as smooth and satisfying as when you're Fighting Street, as combinations are hard to put together and most of each character's moves just feel stiff. World Heroes employs the same three-button control scheme as several other early Neo Geo fighters, with one button set to punch, another to kick and the third to throw  and while this allows for compatibility with the Wii Remote alone, instead of necessitating the Classic or Cube Controller, you'll be left wishing things were more complex, and that you did need more buttons.   There is one interesting innovation included in World Heroes that's worth making mention of, and that's the optional Deathmatch mode. In Deathmatches, the fights you fight will take place in more dangerous, interactive environments that feature such lethal elements as electrified fences and massive walls of spikes. You can do quite a bit of damage to your opponents by using these ring barriers to your advantage, and it is pretty comical to see your foes flung again and again into unavoidable massive damage. That's something that Street Fighter never did, and while it's not a big distinction, well  it's something.World Heroes had enough of a hook with its roster of historical legends that arcade-goers of the early '90s probably weren't too opposed to the idea of dropping in a few quarters to check it out. But after a few rounds, those players would have ended up back in front of the Street Fighter cabinet  as you would too. World Heroes is a fair fighter, and does have a handful of interesting, unique features, but ultimately you'd be better off spending your Wii Points on a download of Capcom's classic instead, or waiting for some of the better, more developed Neo Geo titles to become available in the future.", "date": "Oct 10, 2007"}
