They're all cut from the same metal and they have no allegiances to humans really. If they got their act together they could be righteous and take over like in the Terminator or Matrix movies. But if you put some humans in them they're bound to get in a good scuffle here and there. If this thing is your cup of tea, then you already know about the Gundams. With SD Gundam Force: Showdown! these robots have been shrunk in the wash and are now extra cute and hyperactive, much like the target market since this game is clearly geared towards the younger set. If you want some simplified combat, this is your game, but the elders should look elsewhere.   With the SD standing for ~super deformed~ these Gundams aren't much bigger than the humans in the game which makes one wonder just how small the humans inside the Gundams are. Are all the pilots midgets?One wonders, but since there's no real answers to these gripping questions, the best thing to do is focus on the gameplay, or what there is of it, and just what this means for fans of the series.   In a nutshell the action here is extremely straightforward with the biggest goal being to destroy as many other robots as possible before the time limit runs out. Thee levels are not particularly huge and clearing them once is pretty easy to pull off. The key here is the word ~once~ since by going back to previous rooms the Gundam will encounter more robots who have respawned in order to get a better score. This starts out simple and gets monotonous real quick with the whole idea being to go back and forth and back again to keep finding more targets.    To make the action somewhat more interesting there have been some upgrades and different forms that can be earned to make the Gundams more powerful, but it's not a very deep set of expansions and the basic gameplay of mashing buttons and repeating rooms is the core of what this is all about. There are some bosses to deal with as well, but even these are simplified versions of bosses in other games. Shoot, block, and keep shooting until the bad guy falls apart. Rarely does it get much more interesting than that.   Making the game a little more frustrating is the camera system which has a fixed camera system like in the original Resident Evil games. This leads to plenty of shooting at, or being shot by, enemies who are off-screen. It's a pretty clumsy system and like everything else in this game it's held up by the appeal of the characters, but really little else. If you're willing to put up with a game which is just shy of average to see some super deformed robots beat each other up, then this one is worth a little bit of a look.There's really not a lot to say about SD Gundam Force: Showdown! other than that it provides a subpar experience all around. There's a solid feeling to the robots and the style of the game is cute, but there's nothing that really makes the game stand out and as such is only deserving of attention for those who are absolute die-hard fans who really need to see these robots in action. The best part of the game is that cute Gundams are on-screen beating each other up, but the worst part is that that's pretty much it.", "date": "Oct 13, 2004"}
