After a brief stint on the late NeoGeo Pocket Color, the Ogre Battle series finally arrives on Nintendo's handheld in the form of Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis. Like the NGPC game, Tactics Ogre is a ~Gaiden~ (Japanese for side story) game in that it uses the gameplay system from its predecessor but takes the player on a side story to the overall Ogre Battle saga. The actual game system is of course based on isometric gameplay of the SNES Tactics Ogre, which was later quite clumsily ported to 32-bit consoles.   Features 40 hours of Gameplay  Multiple endings  Link cable play for two players (multiple cartridges necessary)  Battery save (three slots + interrupt save)  Only for Game Boy Advance  In case you're not familiar with the Ogre games, the franchise is divided into two unique game types. The Ogre Battle games, which have appeared on SNES (that version was subsequently ported to PlayStation), N64, and NGPC, are essentially real-time strategy RPGs with semi-automatic, turn-based battles. Players move groups of units over large maps in real time and battle any enemies they encounter. Your opponent's units are hidden unless you have a direct line of sight and you not only liberate towns but also have to defend your headquarters from enemy takeover. Tactics Ogre, on the other hand, appeared only on the Japanese Super Famicom (later ported to Saturn and PlayStation) and features manual battles. Instead of parties, you control single units which you move one by one on smaller, isometric maps. Apart from the single character movement, the biggest difference is that you give concise orders to your units in Tactics Ogre. Various strategy elements come into play, such as position of your character relative to your opponent (attacking from the back prevents counter attacks), terrain and elevation, element, level, weapon, and so on. While the Ogre Battle games take terrain and character stats into consideration, it's more about how you put your troops together and deploy them, whereas Tactics Ogre takes a hint from the old Intelligent Systems franchises (like Fire Emblem) and focuses on strategic unit placement and movement during actual battles. This gives Tactics Ogre a much more Chess-like quality.   Let's get this out of the way first: Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis is a fine strategy RPG that is plenty deep and will please RPG fans and strategy gamers alike. Until Fire Emblem arrives in the US, there really is nothing like it out here for Game Boy Advance. But in many ways, Tactics Ogre is also a throwback to the old days of strategy gaming. The focus on turn-based unit movement in the first Game Boy Advance Ogre game comes at a price: a much slower pace. As fun as it is to put your units in place and strategically attack your foes, the moment your turn ends, get ready for a whole lot of waiting. Unlike similar games like Fire Emblem, Tactics Ogre does not let you speed up the battle animations or cut down on display options during the computer's turn. On the upside, Tactics Ogre has the traditionally deep character class system the Ogre Battle franchise is famous for. Even though the number of individual stats have been reduced and there are less classes than in the 80-hour marathon known as Ogre Battle 64, RPG fans will find everything from the lowest Soldier, over Lichs, Summoners, and Shamans to wild beasts like Dragons, Gorgons, and Octopi (woohoo, they're back!). As a matter of fact, much of Tactics Ogre's gameplay still revolves around unit management and upgrades. Trying to ~evolve~ one of your characters into an Angel Knight by making sure the stats and alignment are all ideal and then getting him or her slain on purpose makes the battles almost secondary to the fun of managing your characters. In an attempt to give fans of the series something new to talk about, developer Quest also added a new Emblem system. Basically, performing certain actions in battle or during training will earn you specific emblems that are in turn required for class changes. It's a neat addition, but I would have hoped for a couple more upgrades in the class and battle system to make Knight of Lodis more of a game of its own than a rehash. Alas, this is a problem that seems to befall the entire Ogre Battle series ever since former Quest designers Matsuno, Minagawa, and Yoshida left the company and joined Square (where they used their ~Tactics~ expertise to create Final Fantasy Tactics). It speaks for the quality of the original titles that the sequels still manage to entertain and inspire.    Have you every played an Ogre Battle game? As far as presentation goes, Knight of Lodis delivers the goods. The isometric backgrounds are colorful and beautifully detailed, down to changing weather conditions. Like most of the classic strategy RPGs, Tactics is in dire need of some idle animations for the characters (the units do the old walking in place routine), but while not exactly flashy, the actual battle animations and effects are excellent. The music is of usually high Quest quality and the diverse sound effects, from subtle crickets chirping in the night scenes to the actual battle noises, are excellent as well. Add to that a complex storyline that's a far cry from the usual ~save the princess~ fare Game Boy players had to put up with over the years, and you've got one of only few handheld games targeted at an older, more mature gamer. As a matter of fact, so much happens in the story that you might want to take notes who is who. Unlike its predecessors, Knight of Lodis doesn't have a ~Report~ function that summarizes the major events and shows the character relations.  For all the sluggishness and the game's derivative nature, Tactics Ogre remains a deep and addictive strategy RPG the will last you for a long time. The new Emblem system is a welcome addition that serves as a breath of fresh air to the classic class system. You'll have to adjust and change your character strategies all the time to get the emblems you want, which adds an extra dose of variety to the gameplay. But as cliched as the statement is, I have to say it: this game is definitely not for everyone. However, if you have a penchant for roleplaying games and you enjoy games like Advance Wars, don't think twice about buying this title. As a Game Boy game, Tactics Ogre brings unprecedented strategy gameplay to a handheld system. Even though developer Quest simplified certain elements over the SNES predecessor, Tactics Ogre remains the most complex strategy game to hit the GBA. When I heard that Quest was developing an original Tactics Ogre game for GBA (rather than porting the original), I was hoping for a few more upgrades -- but as a side story -- a sort of companion title to the original game -- Tactics Ogre works quite nicely. There are some downsides, such as the sluggish pace and initially overly easy computer AI, but once you get deeper into the game and get wrapped up in the storyline you'll soon forget about these shortcomings. Upgrading your characters is as fun as it's ever been and the graphics look just as nice as on the Super Famicom. A new Quest mode that allows you to win items and a two-player head-to-head mode (you'll need a second copy of the game) round off a good RPG package. Until Fire Emblem arrives, Tactics Ogre is most likely going to be as good as it gets for strategy gamers on GBA. Unless you're the impatient sort who stopped playing games like Final Fantasy because the summoning animations were too long, give this one a look.", "date": "May 15, 2002"}
