I would normally retort, ~God only knows.~ But in this case, the folks at Artoon, the Japanese outfit behind the original Xbox exclusive platformer, Blinx and this sequel, are dying for you to find out.   Like last year's Jak II, Ratchet and Clank 2: Going Commando and this year's Sly Cooper: Band of Thieves, Artoon's game has expanded into non-traditional platform territories. From my 10-hour bout with this sequel, I can tell you Blinx 2: Masters of Time and Space is a polished, funny platformer that plays more like a light-weight action game. The moderate use of stealth, the heavy use of gadgets and weapons, and the constant switch between the feline and the pig teams creates more varied gameplay, but does that make it 10 or even two times better than the original?    It turns out that Blinx 2  is a solid, if slightly above ordinary, platform game. It's good looking, packs some great features, and at times the insanity of its humor overcomes its childishness. For a system lacking in platformers, this Xbox exclusive has enough going for it to look at, rent, or even buy. But despite Artoon's best efforts to keep things fresh, nothing in this Blinx 2's core has that must-have, must-buy quality.   Gameplay  Reminiscent of stories found in several Sega Sonic games (with its all mighty Power Crystal), Blinx 2 puts players in a pitched battle for the shards of the Big Crystal, a powerful icon that's sought after by the pig-run Tom Tom Gang, but only truly understood by the feline-run Time Sweepers. In a change from the original, players take control of both the Time Sweepers and their mastery of time, and the Tom Tom Gang, who control space, switching to and fro between the two groups as the game progresses. But you don't actually play as Blinx himself. The story premise is the stuff of silliness; it's occasionally hilarious but more often amateurish, and it's just barely enough to compel people through this sequel.    Yo Keanu, I'm a copycat! What's interesting, however, isn't the story -- it's how broadly this game reaches. Artoon's incorporation of character customization, for instance, is surprising. You'll be able to change dozens of aspects to your team members on either side; from the basics, like eye and suit color to flag emblem design, to unusual things like the length of ears, width of shoulders, and the length and width of tails. This comes more into focus once you're done with the single-player campaign and vie in four-player split-screen fights.    Blinx 2's character duality creates a dichotomy between the two character types. On the one hand, you'll have Blinx's familiar squad, who control time. Players can not only rewind time, but they can pause it, fast-forward it, pull off bullet-time dodges, and solve time-related puzzles. The newer time-controlling abilities more or less fulfill and complete the original's premise, which felt like a great idea not entirely fleshed out. There are enough mid-range physical puzzles and obstacles that require time manipulation to make things reasonably fun, if not a little repetitive.   On the other hand, the pigs control space. You'll find all sorts of wacky ideas here -- hypercloaks, warp tunnels, void traps, space bubbles and more. These take a little more time to get accustomed to, and they change the all-good guy status of the game, too. Of the two types, I preferred the time abilities more because I found them to be more intuitive to use. I can see why someone might find the pig team equally fun, but by splitting the game into the two player camps, I think Artoon might find that gamers only like one half the game, kind of the way I feel.     The small gamble may pay off, however: The two-player co-op games are terrific. The Novice game enables two players to play through the game normally. The Specialist mode encourages you to specialize in either fighters (going straight into fights) or time sweepers (using time to flail enemies into oblivion). You can play through with pigs as well.   With the high level of customization of their two distinct teams, gamers will find four-player split-screen matches more than average fun. But it gets better. You're able to use special abilities and tools such as jetpacks and special barriers, and you can use time and space controls in different ways, like turning your enemy into a screaming baby piglet or kitty! Sadly, Blinx 2 isn't online, even if the multiplayer games beg for it. Still, these mini-games are good, despite their slowdown when too many things explode on screen simultaneously.   Blinx 2 uses a healthy mix of platforming and gadgetry. The levels are small to medium in size but well designed, and in the easier of the two modes you'll find everything is ridiculously spelled out for you. (In Normal mode, they're less obvious.) There are a hefty amount of items to collect, since collecting is the premise behind the game, and Artoon has done a crafty job of squirreling away tons of little goodies in every level.   In traditional platformers, developers used fewer weapons and items. Though some of these ideas work out well in Blinx 2, I found that the Shops were disappointing. I'd rather access items as I pick them up, or store them as I go. Part of this disappointment in the shop and the items in general is that the diversity of items isn't all that interesting. The other downfall is that other games do it better -- namely the last two Ratchet and Clank games, which have better shops and better weapons and items.   Graphics  Technically, Blinx 2 is a fully fledged Xbox game. It's filled with excellent visual treats: bloom lighting, tons of shiny reflective surfaces (water, the armor on your cats, your googles, etc.), soft focus, and high resolution textures.   Face off with weird-ass enemies regularly. Artoon's game is a funny mixture of animals in space suits and pigs in pirate outfits all pulled together in a wild universe run by gear-heavy clocks and ephemeral female spirits. It's pretty wild. But the game's design is all over the board.   There is no debating it, though, these characters share an uncanny resemblance to those in StarFox. It's difficult to see the feline CEO or hear the dead-serious controller talk and not think, ~Holy Cow, it's StarFox with cats.~ I guess it's hard to make a furry game and not relate it back to the old classics.    The variation of characters is strong. You can pick and play any one of your team members, and their distinct looks and good animation add greatly to the overall visual feel. The environments are cartoon-like in design, cloaked with simple but sharp, shiny textures, and supported by good water textures and funky, original enemy types.   Sound  Artoon is bent on merging the classic platforming music -- i.e. strange repetitive renditions of circus music -- with light Japanese jazz, and the result is, well, mind-numbingly jazzy circus music. OK, that's not entirely true, but it sounds funny. The music is light, techo-in-spirit, and catchy. It's cute, and you may just walk away whistling a tune from the game afterward.    The sound effects and voice acting are likeable. I guess that's the whole thing about Blinx 2. Everything is likeable, not loveable. There are some funny little audio gems, though. Like for instance, when you go through the training tests; if you fail, a crowd will pipe in and laugh at your failure. It's cruel, but amusing. The voice work is oddly humorous, too. The cats sound so serious and altruistic, they're funny.Having always played dozens of platformers over the years, I find it mildly interesting that Blinx 2: Master of Time and Space is going the way of Naughty Dog and Insomniac. Artoon's time and space bending platformer is an example of the trend toward getting away from traditional head-bonking, twitch design, and stretching out toward action, adventure, stealth, weapons and gadgetry. It does some of these things well and some not so well. For instance, stealth is executed with the most simplistic notions, while gadgetry and weapons are very base-level, too. But the lunacy of a pirate pig throwing a warp hole to catch an enemy is hard to match. It's so inane, it's funny. All in all,  Blinx gets most things right, but not everything. Still, for being a cuddly platformer filled with furry animals, Blinx 2 cuts against the platformer grain. This is thanks to the complexity of some moves and the extensive training required to nail them. I just wanted to jump in and play, but the game forces you to use its depth. Which is well and fine, but the steps required to use these gadgets and tools are not as intuitively useable as, say Ratchet and Clank, and they're sometimes awkward in a quick pinch. This should be a quick pick-up-play game, but it's not. At times it's tedious and intrusive. At other times it's clever and engaging. Despite some awkwardness, Blinx 2 is a solid, quirky platformer with a healthy amount of replay value and enjoyable multiplayer options. It's definitely worth renting, and if you're bent on buying an exclusive platformer on Xbox, get this.", "date": "Nov 16, 2004"}
