Of course, that was before I ever had the chance to play it. Now, having run through all Music Mixer has to offer, I'm left wondering -- what the f$@% were they thinking? Billed as an entertainment experience, this poor excuse for karaoke was built on a solid concept, but failed in its execution.  Music Mixer comes at the moderate price of $39.99, complete with the software disc for the Xbox and a mic that plugs into your controller. This party-in-a-box helps you create slideshows and even psychedelic videos to go along with the music on your Xbox. And, of course, it turns your Xbox into a karaoke machine. The most impressive (and most functional) aspect of Mixer allows you to rip WMAs, MP3s, and JPEGs from your computer to your Xbox (after downloading some freeware from Microsoft). This last part is extra nice since CD-RW's are notorious for not working on the Xbox. As such, this is your best hope for getting your free floating music (a nice term for ~pirated~) onto your Xbox for use in games that support custom soundtrack. Equally nice is that Music Mixer has a huge database of song and album titles and will properly name 90% of all music on your 'box. And that's about where the niceties end.  The trouble begins at the interface. Some aspects of the interface are simple and easy to navigate. Even mom and pop should be able to create a simple slideshow to play on the TV while listening to music (though why they'd want to is anyone's guess). You can even choose different fades and wipes between images. But there are far too many areas in Mixer where nothing is labeled. There's a pretty robust number of equalizers that allow you to adjust your music to your liking, but nothing is labeled so you need trial and error to figure out how the sound will change. That lack of easy identification is all over Music Mixer and turns it from an everyman machine even mom and pop can love into a complex device that requires a little dedication to learn. It's not hard, but any confusion could have been avoided with some common-sense labeling.    But hey, what really matters is that you can do some karaoke at home with this baby! Except that you really can't. I tried Music Mixer on three different TVs, two different Xboxes, and with two different microphones and the results were always the same -- it sucks. Even with the music turned all the way down, the mic turned all the way up, and my lips surrounding the mic as if it were a reenactment of me IGN job interview, my voice was still barely audible from the TV. Even when I cranked the volume, it sounded like Lurch was singing to me. Sorry, but when I sing I create brand new notes nobody knew existed and I want to hear them.       As if that weren't enough insult, Music Mixer comes loaded with a paltry 15 karaoke songs, several of which are throwaways people would only sing in a bar after being very drunk. ~Yeah, I had my friends over and we all sang Auld Ling Syne and For He's a Jolly Good Fellow.~ What, no Happy Birthday? Perhaps most insulting is that new packs of bad karaoke songs can be downloaded for $10 a pop! Why not just buy a cheap, preloaded karaoke machine from a department store for a hundred bucks?  You can, if you are so inclined, perform karaoke to your own songs that have been ripped to your Xbox, but the function that ~strips away the vocals~ isn't particularly smart and merely muffles the vocals and about half the guitar licks. There was a world of possibility here and none of it was realized. From the lame virtual ravers to the ghastly selection of tunes (okay, some of them are good, many of them suck), Music Mixer seems like something a dad ~trying to be hip~ would make. Nobody who is cool should ever been seen with this bad boy in their hand.  If you need karaoke on your TV, get Karaoke Revolution on the PS2. Otherwise, go to a bar, get drunk, and sing your heart out (even if they don't have a karaoke machine). Music Mixer is a fine idea that doesn't work properly. If I wanted to hear myself sound like I'm singing down a well, I'd go jump in a well. In fact, that's what I'm off to do. Ciao.", "date": "Feb 6, 2004"}
