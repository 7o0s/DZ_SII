{"name": "NBA Hang Time", "name_review": "NBA Hang Time", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/06/04/nba-hang-time", "text": "With basketball games becoming more complex and in-depth, hoop games like NBA Jam and NBA Hang Time just aren't as appealing as they used to be. Still, doing a pump-reverse from the three-point line is always fun.  Much like NBA Jam, Hang Time still possesses that two-on-two partnership between the best players on each team. In addition to current stats and rosters, this game also features a substitution option, enabling the players to mix and match up against opponents.  Unlike NBA Jam, NBA Hang Time features a team-dunk option that enables a player to pass off in mid-dunk to another player to finish the job. Meaning, if Gary Payton was going up for a dunk and was going to get his soul swatted out of him by Rodman, he could dish to the man jumping right above him, Shawn Kemp. The end result: Kemp lets Rodman have it.  Besides these small redeeming qualities, the game itself looks horrible. The heavy pixelated characters look and move awful. Sometimes, you can't even tell your own teammates apart.   Overall, this game isn't worth much to those who want a true basketball game. However, if you were into the NBA Jam and NBA Jam Extreme series, then you'll like this one.  Jay Boor", "date": "Jun 4, 1997"}
