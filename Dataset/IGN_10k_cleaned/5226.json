Sometimes I forget why I so ambitiously poked and prodded my way into this industry in the first place. Sometimes my eyes glaze over and I can't see anything beyond the dreaded fog of lowbrow racers, backward brawlers, and sensationally awful shooters whose only benefits are the neat arcs that zigzag out of the microwave after the third minute in. Sometimes I just want to vacate and make sandwiches for a living. Then I play Jak 3 and I remember -- I remember warmth and happiness and days untouched by the all consuming hopelessness of Varmint Hunter. (I hate that game something fierce, by the way.)  Every so often a game comes around that's right and it makes me remember. It's a game that makes piles of other lesser games very, very wrong. There are precious few words that can so accurately describe this ~correct~ product in its entirety, but there are plenty to describe individual parts of it. Jak 3 is right, but if you dig through your lexicon you can easily break the game down into chunks of gorgeous, wonderful, fun, slick, polished, tight, balanced, well-produced, hilarious, intense, diverse, and wondrous... Buy it or die.  And if I were a smart man, I'd leave the article there and fill the rest of this page with videos of me giddily smiling and playing (it's a sort of stationary prance). Since I'm not that intelligent, here comes my winded review of choice.   As the third in a series of mascot titles, Jak 3 makes an even more radical departure from Jak 1 than Jak 2 did. Basically, there are more vehicles and there is a bigger emphasis on shooting. Before I explain how and why this is good, I feel compelled to clear the air a bit. On IGN, Jak 2 was grossly overrated. I'm sorry, but the tedium of hover driving just wasn't any good. In fact, Jak was probably regarded a touch too highly, also. All that is now spilt milk. Don't dwell on it, for whether you compare Jak 3 to its predecessors or take it as a standalone title, you're in for a phenomenal experience that must not be missed (less you welcome death at our hands).   Desert Racing = Good  To understand this, let's first look at why the third is better than the second. Jak 2 had a real problem with pacing. Not only was it a tedious game that featured excessive use of hovercraft in Haven City, the missions weren't successively disparate enough, which made playing through a bulk of the title redundant and almost trivial. Jak 3 remedies this entirely. The first half of the game actually features little to no prerequisite world navigation. Missions come back-to-back and take moments to reach. When it is required to move to a distant point, the game will actually tack on extra missions between points A and B so that there is always something exciting to do.   After the second half of Jak 3 there are a few instances where you'll be required to revisit a scaled down version of Haven and see it from the saddle of a hover-crap-thing, but even this is infinitely more enjoyable than it was before. First of all, you don't have to worry about wretched cops. Second, the city itself is engulfed in war and eventually every street turns into a massive battlefield where it can sometimes feel like there are more combatants than buildings.   Not only do you move between missions faster than before (and over more interesting terrain), the missions themselves are also finely honed, balanced, and extremely diverse. It's not uncommon to rapidly switch between racing, time sensitive platforming, incredibly complex platforming, free-roaming action, free-roaming shooting, on-rails shooting, and freaking tobogganing. Some missions are more challenging than others and will require a few deaths to figure out, but the classic Jak instant load is in place, so getting back into things is never a big issue.      Now we come to where Jak excels on its own. Simply, Jak didn't piss me off. It sounds tripe, but it's extremely important. I died a hundred times while playing through the game for this review, but I never became seriously upset and I did beat it. When I thought about this for a time, I figured something important out: I failed because I was no good.   Jak 3 offers a gamer just about everything. There are twelve interesting guns, four melee attacks, a dark Jak with melee and ranged attacks all his own, and a light Jak capable of shielding himself, flying, freezing time, and self healing. There are also a handful of different vehicles, an ever-present hover-board Marty McFly would be proud of, and a lot of stationary turrets. It's also a game with the tightest control, the smoothest framerate, the clearest indicators, and the most responsive characters. But I still couldn't win most missions the first time through. The AI is good, the levels are well designed, and death is certainly avoidable, but I'd still die a lot. Why is that?  Honestly, I couldn't win in one shot because I wasn't very good. Jak is so well designed, the only way a person can really lose is by not being good enough. It's a little unnerving to admit inadequacy like that, but it's bloody honest. There are benefits to this, though. Not only does this admittance preclude any real hostility toward the ~damn cheating bastard computer,~ it also delivers a profound sense of accomplishment when the challenge is eventually beaten. I couldn't win because I wasn't good enough, but now I won which means I am good enough. This makes playing through again and again fun. Try and understand this. I die and it's fun. If ever there was a testament of quality...   Animal Abuse = Good  It helps that every mission comes with interesting in-game cutscenes -- the characters are loveable, their dialogue genuine and appropriate, and their plight relatable. It is possible to lose your footing in the story since it does require a fair bit of familiarity with previous Jak games, but whether or not you recognize every character, you'll still want to progress through their tale just to see what they'll do next and how cool it will be. Most importantly, all of this mission-to-mission narrative and gameplay satisfaction culminates in one incredibly spectacular, satisfying, climactic ending full of surprises. Remember when games had real endings? Oh hell yeah.   When it does end, you'll be disappointed. I was. Approximately ten to fifteen hours of Jak 3 is great, but it goes by way too fast. In place of a multiplayer mode, Naughty Dog offers a couple of random mini-games (Digitized Daxter in Pac-Man universe is a big time waster) and a whole lot of secrets.   Many of the secrets are gameplay oriented, which makes pursuing them before winning profitable. To unlock secrets, you must spend collected metal head skulls /gems / gold egg things on talking kiosks that award Jak with a different kind of currency if he does something for them. This different kind of money -- a glowing red egg-skull-whatever -- can be used to buy secrets at any time.   The Precursor or Haven city booths usually task Jak with racing through a series of checkpoints in a certain amount of a time, reaching a specific point with the aid of time freezing powerups, or finding some random location. Here's the thing, the timed races and checkpoints and temporal freeze games are cool, but the, ~here's a picture of a random area now go find it in ten seconds~ crap has to be one the stupidest gameplay ideas I've been forced to endure in years. It's totally unnecessary, horribly boring, and very aggravating.       You get a picture of some place near you and there's a glowing red egg, now you're supposed to figure out where that is. Why? Why would you put that in such an amazing game? Why would you do something so hurtful? Not only does it suck, it's also a bit unfair. The environments of Jak 3 are the most detailed environments any action platformer has ever had, ever (and you can quote me on that). Because of this, finding some stupid ass glowing red thing in the middle of them is just insane. It's also a complete waste of time.   If Jak were ugly, or at least less beautiful, this particular mini-game might have been doable. But when you have a title that honestly looks better than 95% of Xbox and GameCube games on a system that just shouldn't be capable of doing what it's doing, there's going to be trouble. Take away the infinite draw distance, the amazingly complex polygonal structures, all the dynamic lighting, the thick, rich particle effects, and absurdly detailed exteriors that blend seamlessly into even more finely combed, massive interiors and maybe I'll be able to find your damn red egg.  While it's not the most incredible improvement over Jak 2, the aesthetic differences are definitely apparent. It's the way the whole world feels connected (and never, ever loads). It's the way a desert night feels like a desert night, and an intricately detailed deathtrap of a precursor ruin feels ancient and deadly. If you're looking for art and technical achievement, Jak has it...Jak is it. Characters animate so smoothly it actually makes playing other games painful. Painful, I saw! And it never stutters, never glitches, never hitches, and never, ever lets up. Front to back, there isn't a second that doesn't look good. Incredible job, Naughty Dog, now find your own red eggs, you bastards.  Desert Blasting = Good I thought about writing more. I thought about detailing all the different gameplay modes and enemies and bosses and weapons. I thought about trying to convince you of how good and ultimately satisfying the story is. I thought about belittling the last Jak a bit to drive home my insistence that this one is infinitely superior. I thought about a lot of things, but mainly I'm thinking about Jak 3.Don't be mad about the lack of pages and geeky information in this review. I'm doing you a favor. If I detailed all that I had wanted to, I'd be giving away too much. The surprise that comes from being hit by the different gameplay types and storyline twists should not be spoiled for anyone.If you need more reassurance, just think about this: I get paid to review games for a living and I have access to just about every game out there. And now, after I've beaten Jak 3, all I can think about is going home and beating Jak 3.", "date": "Nov 5, 2004"}
