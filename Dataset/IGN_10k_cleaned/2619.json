While FIFA reigns supreme as king of the football simulators year in and year out in terms of sales, and Konami's ISS remakes still claim the hardcore crown, less technical fans looking to try their gumption have been begging for a Blitz-style soccer piece for years. Who better to deliver the mustard than the creators of Blitz themselves? Hot of the presses at Midway comes RedCard 20-03.  Graphics Midway certainly knows how to put together a quality grass texture. Vibrant and realistic, the soccer lawn is a better field than most anywhere else. Solid, well-designed stadiums and arenas are also worth their salt, but the near-lifeless crowd doesn't quite match the audio fanfare that goes with it. It doesn't make a lot of sense when you hear the mob like-roar of the audience only to watch them sit flatter than a river leech. Goal celebrations improve the situation quite a bit however, as the crowd really comes alive with confetti, streamers, flashbulbs, and more.   Character models are moderately sized and offer a fair amount of familiar animation by way of classic soccer attacks. Close up facial expressions, taunts, and all sorts of human reaction have been scattered throughout the presentation with the only real concern surrounding the far camera shots. Kind of bland with a healthy dose of shimmer, the downfield angles could have used some work. Like the crowd though, the players really stand out whenever a point is made, with dramatic celebration animations and some effective celebratory flotsam.   Of course what people really want to know about are the special effects. Fiery bicycle kicks, slow-motion Matrix-like double taps, and a few other choice selections did manage to make the final cut, but if you're looking for crazy volcanic soccer balls or earthquakes that open up the ground and swallow your people whole, RedCard can't match Hitz or Blitz by way of the zanies. Sound Since this is supposed to be an arcade game we figured that the announcers would have plenty of humorous quips and comments, and that our office would be rolling in bombastic Midway humor. Were we wrong or what?   Don't misunderstand; the play calls are top notch and very professional but at times just way too realistic for our liking. While we were on the field fouling each other like a pair of squabbling siblings, the gentlemen behind the mike were quaintly chatting away like this was a real life soccer game. Where are the jokes? The ribs? Where's the Boom-Shaka-Laka?   The rest of the audible goodies are well done with an effective (if not hypocritical) crowd chanting and cheering for their teams and referees that blow their whistles like train conductors. The pang of the ball kick, the slight swish of the net, it's all in there.  Gameplay Playing the game isn't as cut and dry as the other features, as it can be severely affected by one little option: The Referee Strictness. Basically the cut off point between sim and arcade, a quick slide of the bar from 'strict' to 'off' completely changes everything. With strictness turned on, the game is damn near unplayable. As almost every defensive play you make is given the red card, and before you know it, you're staring at the referee's baldhead more than the action on the field. Not my idea of a good time.   The real meat of the game is when there are no rules at all, forcing you to go tooth and nail with the other team in a balls-out struggle to be number one. Slide kicks, slide tackles, flaming hot-foot bombs to the face, and all other manner of nastiness is a great way to relieve stress and an even better way to win. Rules are for sissies.   Chances are that if you've played Blitz then you'll pick up on RedCard in no time. Boost buttons, turbo keys, a fantastic two player mode, and all the other familiar control schemes from the NFL days are still in effect, with the learning curve slanting in your direction after about five minutes. Despite the similarities to Blitz and its similar NHL cousin, however, RedCard doesn't quite live up to the party topping entertainment that those two did.   The problem lies in the fact that RedCard never quite decides whether or not it wants to be a simulation or an arcade game. Even when moving the Ref-bar all the way down to 'off,' the flash and over the top wackiness found in Midway's other productions just isn't there. Closer to FIFA without rules than Blitz with a soccer ball, staying interested as intensely as you would in another similar title (like GameCube's Sega Soccer Slam or even NHL Hitz). Several contests into our office round robins, we realized that RedCard's engine was a strong one, but leaned too far in the simulation side to be as fun as it could have been.The schizophrenic hybrid brother of FIFA World Cup and Soccer Slam, RedCard 20-03 is a solid if not middle of the road game. If you enjoy futbol more than anyone else in your neighborhood, however, and absolutely need to have every game on the market, you could do a lot worse. Not realistic enough for the hardcore EA crowd and not outrageous enough for fans of Midway's previous efforts, we'd recommend this one for rental with the option to buy.", "date": "Apr 16, 2002"}
