{"name": "Jumpgate", "name_review": "Jumpgate: The Reconstruction Initiative", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/15/jumpgate-the-reconstruction-initiative", "text": "In the future, interstellar travel, and the progression of mankind with it, will be jarred to a sudden halt after the known universe becomes crippled by an immense, catastrophic astrological shockwave. After said shockwave, remaining inhabited worlds begin to slowly find ways to reestablish communication and eventually trade with one another. That's the world of Jumpgate, a new massively multiplayer online space sim.  You join one of three factions that fall under the greater web of The Reconstrcution Initiative (TRI): Quantar, Solrain, or Octavius. As a TRI pilot, you take on missions, engage the dreaded Conflux, and do the sorts of things intrepid spacefarers do.  When first played, it will become immediately apparent how Jumpgate distinguishes itself from other games of the genre. Eschewing the over-the-top dogfighting and instinct-based flight that has become synonymous with other space-sims the likes of Wing Commander, Freespace and Starlancer, Jumpgate opts for the entirely Newtonian approach. Flight revolves around a developed set of physics that attempt to emulate what traversing the vast reaches of space in crafts of these sorts would actually feel like. The ideology is sound: realism begets enjoyment, but the implementation leaves a bit to be desired.  You don't go where you turn. That's the easiest and best way to sum up the control. You can try and turn, but it'll take a good five seconds before your direction actually changes (depending on choice craft of course). The attempt to bring true to life physics centered around excessive inertia to the game world is noteworthy (though seemingly not as refined as I-War's implementation), but there is such a thing as too real.   There's a substantial acclimation period attached to Jumpgate. Because the whole of the game builds upon its physics foundation, the time required to learn how to perform even the most menial tasks is long and tedious. Something as hopefully simple as docking your craft becomes a drawn out, perilous task in itself. All this is compounded for rookies to the game because they will be, for a while, limited to lower level vessels that substantially lack in all categories (making the constant maneuvering and readjustment that much more of a slow chore).  Combat... For starters, player killing is handled through the classification of areas of space as either neutral or controlled via the use of beacons. Neutral areas are unguarded chaotic lands where anything goes, while controlled areas are subject to the laws of the land. Namely, throw the first punch and label yourself an aggressor, kill a bunch of people and become a murderer free to be preyed upon by more honorable members of the community (death and subsequent respawning is handled through insurance and reimbursement that's dependent on any number of factors).  Now, like the flight model, combat also gets tossed about in the wake of the move to physics. I pride myself on my abilities of out-maneuvering and out-piloting even the best of them at the myriad of other space combat titles available, but I found all of my experience in the genre practically useless in Jump. Because of the degree physics are taken into account for, sorties turn into bouts of circle strafes instead of winding chases of cat and mouse. Every ship can turn its nose on a dime, but walks like a crippled pig. This often times leads to two ships just pointing at one another endlessly firing. They're still moving in different directions due to the inertia, but the joy of hanging off someone's tail as they corkscrew around capital ships waiting for that perfect moment when their life becomes missile dust is sorely depleted in part due to the fact that the person you're tailing can swing about in an instant and continue to drift on his previous course while shooting a million times at you.  A lot of this admittedly leans toward my personal preferences as they pertain to control, and I must admit that after awhile I was able to master the dynamics of flight and combat, but they never shook my body in exhilaration. Like the rest of the game, I found them to be passable to good, but never great.   It's not all combat and flight (even though it kind of is). The game's MMORPG aspects are where the money's at, or going to, as it were.  There's always the chat aspect, but atop that, Jump offers plenty the way of ship customization, an assortment of predefined missions to accept or even user-defined ones to partake in, and an evolving story that conforms to the happenings in the game, and not vice versa. Suffice to say there's plenty to do. But the question remains, is the multiplayer component of Jumpgate enough to warrant a purchase over the single player components of X: Beyond the Frontier or even Privateer before it? Yes and no... If you play for the combat and the missions, the game is really no better than those that came before. But, if you yearn for a greater sense of community and camaraderie, you should not be disappointed. However... Unless you can invest the time the game so readily demands for it to become truly enjoyable, you'll find a decidedly empty experience, as it's unforgiving to the ADD inflicted amongst us.    Perhaps the greatest fault in Jumpgate is the title's under-whelming, unremarkably bland graphics that just qualify as passable, or at times, even acceptable because they accommodate lower-end machines and are generally of a smooth sort. Otherwise, if you're looking to gorge your eyes on luster and candy then look elsewhere. The models, explosions, and general effects in Jumpgate are there just to be there. They won't offer any bit of amazement, but will merely convince you that they exist.    Stations are for the most part not of an epic scale and seem undersized, especially when put in the comparison of those that Tachyon or X-Wing Alliance so wondrously offered us. Instead of being grand compilations of jutting structures and docking spaceships, the stationary outposts in Jumpgate are angular assemblages of large, bland polygons with a docking hole thrown into the side of one. Those true fans of space combat games will no doubt recall the killer Colony Wars that graced the shores of the PlayStation some four years ago. As an example, some of Jump's design offerings from the Solrain race are strikingly reminiscent of the Earth Empire's Navy from that cherished PlayStation game. The problem is, the now aged and severely dated Colony Wars manages to oust Jumpgate in direct visual comparison, low resolution graphics aside. Obviously graphics do not make a game, but that's not to say they can't break one.   I also took issue with a lot of poorly developed ~slapped in~ effects, such as the laser beams that seem as if Dan could have drawn them in Microsoft Paint, and the annoying, obtrusive shield effect that cascades across your cockpit every time you're shot, jarring you straight out of any joy that may have been had from the combat system of which I've already touched on.  Perhaps I'm being a bit too critical in this respect. In the end, I leave thinking the game looks at its best decent, but at its worst ho-hum, which is disappointing considering the amounts of aesthetic splendor that now bombard us from other fronts on a daily basis; then, I would have settled for, and been more than happy with visuals akin to Freespace.  Aurally speaking, Jump is as equally ordinary, or standard. There's not much to say other than engines sound like engines and bleeps sound like bleeps. Nothing of exceptional quality is present to make the game stand out from or even directly compete with other more grabbing titles in the genre. Jumpgate's audio samplings live to serve a simple purpose, and that's to make noise.    The average sound and music aren't as glaringly apparent during play as the visuals are, and don't, as such, draw as much from the title. That is, they never made me wish in gaping sighs that there were more. That classifies them as both decent and acceptable, however unspectacular.  It seems that in focusing entirely on the community and physics aspects of their title, NetDevil and 3DO have neglected to include the few large and entirely necessary components of design that differentiate good games from great ones. It's my honest hope that the game then succeeds, at least well enough to warrant a sequel or substantial update to the original, because there is so much untapped potential. As it stands, Jumpgate is a solid outing as far as the massively multiplayer genre goes, but will not win any awards or significant praise from purists of the space-sim.  Pick it up if you crave space combat in any and every form, or just love to meet and greet other online denizens, but be prepared for a slower paced physics focused flight and combat model that won't cater to the new and unfamiliar alike. If you're looking for online Independence War, Freespace, or Starlancer, you'll end up pitching tent in a different solar system, but that doesn't mean you can't stop by Jumpgate and give it a look.   -- Ivan Sulic      Want to share your opinions with the world?
