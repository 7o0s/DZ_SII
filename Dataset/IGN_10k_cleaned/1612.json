The round of new golf games is coming in and consumers are once again asked the question, should I upgrade to this year's version of a game that I pretty much already have. Not in Tiger Woods case it seems. It looks like he needs to practice a bit more. In fact the only reason to buy this game over a game like Links 2001 is if you have a crush on Tiger or you just can't live without some of the courses and pro players featured in EA's game.  That isn't to say that this game is a horrible experience, it's just that there is a better game on the market. It won't look like it when you're navigating through the menu because the game is pretty packed with options, pro players, and beautiful courses. And if the new Sugarloaf, River Highlands, and Robert Trent Jones courses don't do it for you, then you can create your own with the course editor that ships with the game. There is also an excellent golfer creator that you may plug you own face in along with a plethora of game types in which to test your golfer out including the new Presidents Cup. All of the various game types can also be played over the Internet very easily.   The big question is, do you really want to? I didn't really. For a couple of reasons. First off, the ball physics has some weird quirks that you just can't get used to. The ball may look okay when it's traveling through the air, but when it hits the ground, some strange things start to happen. The ball will bounce this way and that for no apparent reason other than it hates you. It actually stopped dead in its tracks once. Plop. There is stayed after hitting off of the tee with a driver. Time to call Mulder and Scully in on this one.  Actually hitting the ball in the right direction can be quite a bit of a challenge. There is very little forgiveness when missing the final click of the familiar three-click style of play so your ball may end up off the beaten path after missing the final mark by only a fraction. It's part of the challenge of a game, but those of you with less hand-eye coordination than others may have a bit of difficulty with this one.  The game certainly doesn't look any better than last year's either and barely runs better. If you drop down to 800x600 or below, you'll start seeing a whole lot of jaggies and texture problems that are just plain bad. The golfers themselves are of very low quality. They use motion captured animations here like Links 2001, but they just aren't anywhere near the quality. And what's with the golfers like blah and blah getting the 3D model treatment like Michael Jordan (who by the way is back and looking as crappy as ever)? They are just so ugly and lifeless. Yuck.  So if they haven't been spending time on the golfer graphics, then they must have been spending time on the textures and engine to improve them from last year right? Think again. The textures, while not really ugly, pop in and out randomly. And at lower detail modes, you'll see the textures bounce all over the damn place after hitting a shot. The problem here is that you'll need a pretty good machine to run the game at high resolution and detail levels. There was significant chop when running at 1024x768 with ultra-high detail turned on for objects and textures. Unfortunately, this is really the only level when things look really good.  One of the features that EA usually prides itself on in all of the sports games they produce is the sound and commentary. For the most part, it was actually pretty decent giving advice on tee, approach, and green shots along with some more helpful insight on the putting green. Unfortunately, some of the commentary is incredibly dull and useless such as, ~looks like he used an iron.~ Good job. And guys, we know that the ladies of golf are a little manly, but there is no reason that you can't call them she or her on the course. All of the commentary is in the masculine, which is really kind of a shoddy mistake, even if it's a bit funny.  So should you buy this new incarnation if you have the old one? That really all depends on whether you feel the couple of new courses, new pro players, and new President's Cup are worth the $40 cost. If you are just looking to buy a new golf game for whatever reason, then my suggestion would be to go and get Links 2001 instead. It's got more solid gameplay and better graphics. Sorry Tiger, but I guess you can't win all the time.  -- Chris Broman", "date": "Dec 7, 2000"}
