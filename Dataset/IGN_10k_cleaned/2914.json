Diablo.  Now, I sense I may have spread a little confusion amongst those of you wondering where the Prince of Qin review is.  Well, just hold your horses.  See, Object Software's latest 2D-isometric perspective title has some pretty big shoes to fill.  Namely, those of Blizzard's benchmark creating, genre-defining game, one that has not met a worthy successor yet.  And while six years old, the standards it set have been the measure by which each subsequent action role-playing games have been judged.  This may seem like an insurmountable hurdle; however, while most of the heirs to Diablo's throne have been set in fantastical settings, Qin infusing the ARPG genre with new blood with its setting in the historical times of the Ancient Qin dynasty of China, over 2200 years ago.   It's time for a little history lesson.  The depth of the research presented in this game is immense.  This has two additional benefits for players.  It fleshes out the time period and the world that the game is set in, making a long-gone time period seem much more accessible to a modern audience.  It also provides the player with greater insight as to why and how these events shaped the history and future of China.  Take notes, because there will be a test at the end.  The Qin dynasty (pronounced ~chin~) is notorious for being not only one of the shortest, but also one of the most controversial ruling periods in all of Chinese, if not world, history.  Under the rule of Ying Zheng (Shi Huangdi or the First August Emperor as he's more commonly referred to), the Qin dynasty unified the country for the first time in its history, thereby ending the longstanding, brutal Warring States period.  The Emperor also created a centralized system of government with a uniform structure of laws, standardized money, measurements and character scripts for the Chinese language.   Even more impressive within its 15-year history were the completion of the Great Wall of China and the construction of the Tomb of the First Emperor.  Yet, with all his imperial enhancements, the First Emperor was also a bloodthirsty tyrant whose cruelty knew no bounds.  Preferring to govern by fear, he tortured, imprisoned or executed countless citizens who had any potential to oppose his rule.  During one such incident, known as the Burning of the Books, he destroyed countless historical works and buried 400 scholars alive.  Only Fu Su, the Crown Prince, dared to question his father, and for his insolence was exiled to the North to help supervise the building of the Great Wall.  The Emperor's advisors, conspiring secretly after the First Emperor's death, forged and delivered imperial orders to Fu Su and the Northern supervising General, Meng Tian, to commit suicide.  In addition, the advisors captured and slaughtered Fu Su's family, to ensure that there would be no familial retribution.  Unfortunately for the people of the Qin Empire, Fu Su and Meng Tian carried out their orders, leaving the rule in the hands of his incompetent younger brother who eventually helped lead the dynasty into ruin.  Are you with me so far?  Good.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.     In Prince of Qin, you assume the role of the Crown Prince, Fu Su.  Taking a chapter from the ~What If~ book, the game ponders what would've happened if the Prince and the General ignored those orders, personally seeking a confirmation from the emperor himself in the Imperial City of Xianyang.  Of course, this necessitates the Prince shedding any and all regal trappings, assuming the clothes and mannerisms of a beggar, and mingling with commoners.  Borrowing from Black Isle's Baldur's Gate series, conversations are carried out through large, context-sensitive dialog trees.  And, like any true RPG, he'll have his share of side quests, missions, and stereotypical ~FedEx~ tasks to complete along the way which net him fame and experience (You know, take package X to Location Y, return for reward, etc.).  Fortunately, a mission log and a annotated journal are provided to help you keep track of the good deeds and oaths you've pledged to do during your travels, as well as those still remaining.  In his search for answers, side quests and revenge for the wrongs committed against him, Fu Su will travel to more than twenty-five separate locations ranging from border towns to Imperial Cities to even barracks of the Qin's most hated enemy, the Huns.   However, one man cannot take on an entire empire alone, forcing you to seek out others who are sympathetic to Fu Su's quest.  Allies from one of five different character classes join you as AI-controlled teammates, each with 20 individual skills and abilities they can offer to you in their journey.  Like Diablo and other RPGs, Fu Su and his allies start at level 1, and accumulate points during each new level that they can allocate to their stats and skills.  These abilities are placed upon a skill tree, with more powerful abilities unlocked at higher levels.  Plus, talents can be selected for quick use in battle; however, unlike those previous titles, Prince of Qin provides instant leveling for newly acquired henchmen.  No longer do you have to shepherd weakened allies throughout battles until they gain comparable experience, but instead you can pitch them into the fray immediately. Perhaps more importantly, Qin allows for the customization of up to four skills on each hand, which provides a faster, more strategic pace to your battles.  No longer are you forced to switch back and forth between offensive and defensive skills; here, you simply hit a button.     Having all of these talents preset may seem like overkill until you get into battle.  In most action/RPGs, your main character is typically forced to fight near-overwhelming waves of creatures.  Qin takes a different approach to combat.  Sure, you'll still face overwhelming odds.  As a matter of fact, there will rarely be a battle where you'll not be outnumbered by at least two to one or three to one.  But instead of supernatural creatures, the enemies you will face are much more realistic.  You can expect to face off against large packs of wild animals as well as roving bands of bandits or regiments from armies.  The mystical beasts that you'll run into are rather few and far between, but are either tied into the mythology of the region or in the employ of powerful wizards.   Obviously, all the skills and henchmen in the country aren't going to help you without good, solid equipment. While the option of going to shops and merchants to buy items and materials is available to you, cities with decent arms and protective gear are rather spread out and at times difficult to get to.  Instead, the majority of your materials and items will come from those articles you manage to scavenge from fallen enemies and natural resources.  Essentially replacing the need for Diablo's blacksmith, foraging for materials gives new meaning to the term, ~living off the land.~  By defeating creatures like boars and tigers, you'll receive health-restoring meat, as well as hides, tendons and bones.  Similarly, you can strip the wood from trees and mine rocks for precious minerals.   With the proper combination of materials, your paladins can fashion any number of weapons and armor to aid your party.   Additionally, if any jewels are found during your journey, your Paladin can imbue a weapon or piece of armor with the property of one of the five elements.  Sound a little strange?  Pick up your notebooks, because it's time to go to class again.  In Ancient China, especially during the Qin Dynasty, it was believed that the world and everything in it was comprised of five separate Elemental forces: Earth, Fire, Metal, Water and Wood.  Each element promoted a new element, and in turn was restricted by another.  Thus, a cyclical dependency was created, allowing for the birth and death of all living things.  Moreover, each creature itself was aligned to a particular element, drawing its strength, health and protection from the associated component.  In Prince of Qin, this theory has been taken fully to heart.  So, for example, if you were fighting a boar whose element was fire, you'd want to use a weapon with an opposing element, such as a club or sword that favored the element of water.   Gameplay within Prince of Qin is rather easy to pickup and learn.  If you've ever played Diablo or an ARPG, you'll understand the basic mechanics of the game, and will be able to start almost immediately upon launch.  While this makes it easier for veterans of the genre to jump in and start delving into the story, it also exposes players to a massive pitfall, that of poor collision avoidance and pathfinding.  There are many times that you'll attempt to maneuver your party one way, only to have them take either the longest route possible or refuse to move period until you shepherd them, step by step, towards your objective.  Similarly, your team, once they receive directions, follows those instructions doggedly, even to the point of ignoring subsequent commands, which can be annoying.    In battle, most of your characters can fend for themselves, although they do have a tendency to go after random enemies once the selected foe is slain.  Henchmen also have a maddening ability to sporadically use skills in combat, which means that if you are going to utilize each character's talents to the fullest, you'll have to do intensive micromanagement.  This, however, is not the easiest thing to do, thanks to the counter-intuitive interface.  For some odd reason, the ~I~ key, commonly used in most games for ~Inventory,~ has been replaced by the ~B~ key for ~Backpack.~  If you need to switch characters, you cannot click on their avatar, but instead must select a smaller picture found along the side of the screen.  Features like these can hamper the speed and the mechanics of play.   However, if you overlook the clunky interface and the rebellious characters under your control, the story and plot that you have are huge and full of twists and turns.  The developers took a lot of creative liberties with their representations of historical figures, and manage to capture the mystery and intrigue of the Qin Dynasty.  Plus, many of the side quests provide even more insight into the culture and people of the time, such as the emphasis on respect for your elders or influence of Confucian thought on daily life.  In addition, the idea of the Five Elements, along with the creation of arms, is an intuitive, and new way to approach battles.  No longer are you dependent upon shops and the money in your wallet.  If you have the time, and the desire to search for quality materials, you can create very powerful items.   Graphically, you're not going to be blown away with the presentation of art in Prince of Qin; that's what the storyline and plot is for.  The background artwork presented is sufficient, and in some cases a little sub-par, for an action RPG title.  There are dull textures that represent mud, grass, or snow, and while the gameplay does vary from mountain terrain to fields to caves, many of them degenerate into massive wastelands with a few trees and rocks, and potentially a building or two.  Fortunately, buildings are a little more detailed, with individual patterns on rugs, baskets, and furniture, but similar items have been represented with more impressive details in games like Diablo and Throne of Darkness.  Even more displeasing is the lack of detail in characters that look like basic 3D sprites with different colored outfits, with the exception of the large heads at the bottom of the screen.  The avatars have no mutable expressions, making the characters seem to be much more nameless and faceless than identifiable.  The most meticulous aspect of the game are the weapons, where Object Software obviously spent a lot of time recreating authentic arms.  However, you won't be able to see the full craftsmanship until you look at the items in the inventory screen.    What did you think of Prince of Qin?   Animation within the game is rather poor also.  During most city scenes, there are very few, if any people who will mill around, perform any daily tasks, or behave in a realistic fashion.  Most of them are rooted to one spot, standing like a two-dimensional cardboard cutout.  Combat is even worse, with attack movements coming across as rather wooden and unrealistic.  For example, wolves and tigers attack by hopping up on their back legs and gliding across to their target.  Similarly, Fu Su's slash from his sword appears to be more of a chop.  This movement is not fluid, but more of a jerky, hectic swing.  Magic effects are also very subdued.  There is very little that's eye-catching in the use of either a skill or a spell, and more often than not, unleashing one of these talents will result in a slowdown of the game, even on high-end systems.  While slightly annoying amongst small numbers, in massive battles this crawl can be unbearable.  The only plus with combat is the gore option, which allows for random eviscerations of enemies; however, this does get stale after the 10th beheading.   Musically, Prince of Qin presents traditional Chinese music as a melodic backdrop to the gameplay.  Light, airy, and entrancing, the calm of the two or three selections are quickly shattered by driving, techno-infused drums and rhythms.  Nowhere is this more invasive than the combat theme, which immediately mutes any and all sound in favor of a brash, jarring orchestral tune.  The sound effects within Prince of Qin are practically non-existent, and are unbelievably few and far between.  With the exception of breaking jars or containers in search for items, the only effects you'll hear are indiscriminate at best.  For example, the incessant hooting of an owl signals the onset of night, and a growl from a wolf might signal an attack.  Speech is present within the game, but the accents that the actors provide are spotty.  While some of this can be placed squarely on the translated dialogue, the rest of the blame falls upon weak line delivery.  For example, Fu Su may have a proper British intonation for one sentence that fades away over the course of the following phrases before re-asserting itself twice as hard later on in the conversation.  There's one feature that I didn't talk about in the above review, and that's multiplayer.  While there is a multiplayer feature, you have to be on either a LAN or a direct TCP/IP connection to take advantage of it.  While the action in multiplayer is faster paced, and you can create unique characters and items, without a feature to search for other users, the fun is definitely sucked out of this option.  In my opinion, skip this feature and focus solely on the single player campaign. Object Software has provided a unique historical perspective to the Action Role-Playing Genre.  It's not perfect by any means, and it won't dethrone Diablo.  But it's a good start, and, more importantly, it has tapped a largely unused goldmine: a cultural history full of action, treachery, heroes, and villains.  Or, in other words, many of the basic plotlines that games revolve around today.  Plus, exposing more people to stories like these may get more people interested in the culture of other nations.  Just think, kids could potentially use this title as an excuse to learn history while having fun at the same time! (I'm not endorsing that over cracking open a textbook or paying attention in class, mind you.)", "date": "Sep 12, 2002"}
