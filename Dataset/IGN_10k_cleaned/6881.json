{"name": "Final Fantasy XI Online", "name_review": "Final Fantasy XI", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/05/03/final-fantasy-xi", "text": "Final Fantasy XI marks the first appearance of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) on the Xbox 360, as well as Square-Enix's first effort for the console. Released back in 2003 for the PC and 2004 for the PlayStation 2, the Xbox 360 is no different save for some graphical upgrades. This latest release on Microsoft's console comes packaged with the full version of FFXI and its three expansions: Rise of Zilart, Chains of Promathia, and the new Treasures of Aht Urhgan. Though there's a staggering amount of content and gameplay awaiting players in FFXI, it's no longer as compelling to plow through as it once was. On the Xbox 360, FFXI shows its age and suffers from issues of unnecessary inconvenience.   For those who've never played an MMORPG before, you'll find starting your adventures in FFXI's world of Vana'diel to be significantly more involved than popping in the disc and pressing Start. Before you do anything, you'll want to make sure to hook a USB keyboard into your Xbox 360, otherwise typing out all the registration codes is going to drive you mad. Secondly, it's highly impractical to talk to anyone in the game if you're not using a keyboard, since typing with the control pad takes forever. Also, you'll need a hard drive with a significant amount of free space, since the install is huge and time consuming. It takes a few hours install, register, and update all FFXI and PlayOnline software, so be sure to block out that time if you're trying to start playing.    FFXI also presents something new to Xbox 360 gamers in the form of a game-specific monthly subscription fee. For $12.95 a month you'll be able to create and play around with one character on a World (server). Creating more than one costs extra as you'll need to set up another Content ID, so doing some research before diving into Vana'diel would be a good idea. Since many Xbox 360 gamers are already paying a monthly fee for the Xbox Live service, this may be more dollars than you're willing to drop on one game. You should also be aware that a high-speed connection is required as well, since this game can only be played online.   Once you get all that out of the way, it's time to create your character and finally start playing. FFXI gives you a choice of male or female versions of Hume, Elvaan, Tarutaru, female-only Mithra, and male-only Galka. Each have their own statistical strengths, making the tiny Taru ideal for magic casting jobs and Galka better equipped for melee combat, with the Hume race somewhere in between. In terms of jobs, FFXI offers a huge array of options. At the game's outset you'll pick between six basic jobs including the high damage Black Mage, durable Warrior, or versatile Red Mage. As you level up and complete certain objectives, you'll eventually be able to access higher level jobs like the Dragoon, Paladin, and Dark Knight. Also available starting at level 18 is the ability to pick a sub-job, which essentially allows you to take part in two character classes at once, though your subjob can only be half the level of your main job. Should you dislike the job you picked at the start, you can always switch at your Mog House, which acts as your home base, though you'll have to build the new job up from level one.   The game begins with you standing in whatever starting city you picked and, after a brief cutscene, you're given control of your character. At this point you might check your instruction manual hopefully for direction on what to do and unfortunately find almost no help as it contains startlingly little information about how to actually play FFXI. You're pretty much on your own. Once you find some gate guards and talk to some of the townspeople, you'll discover they assign you missions and quests, respectively. Embarking on FFXI's missions drives each nation's main story forward, earns you Conquest Points, and forces you out into the vastness that is Vana'diel. Quests are useful for netting extra gil, FFXI's money system, and buffing your character's fame.    Despite the existence of a story in FFXI, it isn't the focus of the game. What you're going to be doing most is grinding through enemies and leveling up, as much of FFXI's more interesting content isn't available until later on. The early going in FFXI is particularly dull. For the first 10 levels you're just going to be mindlessly thwacking monsters in the vicinity of your home city. Afterward, once you join a Linkshell, FFXI's version of a guild, you'll have a large group of other players to party up with. Playing FFXI in a party is far, far more entertaining than the solo play, as you'll need to work together to perform skillchains, magic bursts and generally survive and you continue your quest to hit level 75. In addition to being more fun, partying is basically required of FFXI players very early on.   When not leveling, there's always the Auction House, where players can bid on other players' items or sell their own, and Guild synthesis recipes to keep you occupied. Looting monsters with Signet cast on you yields elemental crystals, which can either be sold at the AH or utilized to combine together raw materials and form new ones. While creating your own items with Guild recipes is an attractive prospect, you're going to need to invest a significant amount of time to synthesizing even some of the most basic recipes. Many items call for you to be a member of multiple Guilds, including Goldsmithing, Bonecraft, Clothcraft, and Woodworking, among others. Doing so means you'll need to visit all their respective headquarters, sign up, listen to the guild members and write down and remember your own recipes. Then it's off to the AH to find the requisite raw materials. If they're not up for sale, it's up to you to find them yourself, in some cases requiring you partake in FFXI's startlingly demanding gardening system.     While it's clear there is a ton of content and options for gameplay, FFXI can't escape from feeling dated in 2006. The game's UI is unintuitive, which doesn't help any new players looking to sink their teeth into this massive experience. Traveling anywhere, even to nearby dungeons, takes an amazingly long time. You can easily spend half an hour simply traveling back and forth between the AH and the Delivery Box in your Mog House, checking price histories and properly arranging your inventory for grinding. Traveling across city zones to find the right gate or NPC to turn a quest in also takes an inordinate amount of time, to the point where you'll have spent several hours playing the game and realize you've accomplished next to nothing.   The same goes for overworld travel. Airships, spells, and chocobo help make travel across Vana'diel faster, but they require certain conditions and quests be completed, generally cost money, and the Airships and spells still only go to a limited number of locations. This makes playing FFXI feel much more like a chore than a game. Partaking in the missions breaks up the monotony of killing the same monster 100 times over, but after you gain a few ranks you'll run into missions which require extensive travel and highly specific group requirements. Assuming you're strong enough, these missions require you to head out from your home city and visit neighboring nations. The journey to one of these places can take a few hours. If you get killed, you'll have to return to your home point, which is generally back where you started.    There are also strange game design elements in FFXI that add to its inconvenience. For instance, when you kill a monster and it drops equipment, crystals, or items, they go straight into your inventory. However, if your inventory happens to be full, the items will be destroyed after a certain time period if you haven't cleared room. To make it worse, your inventory doesn't sort itself. Instead, you have to go in and sort it yourself nearly every time you pick something up. Should your inventory completely fill up, then you'll need to head back to town to unload items on the AH or into your Mog Safe, requiring another few hours of play strictly for organizational purposes.   Taking all this into consideration, FFXI is a game that requires many, many hours to get anything done. It's also a game that needs to be played on nearly a daily basis to keep track of everything that happens, even if it's only for checking on your auctions and gardening status. After a while, it starts to feel more like a job than a game, with requirements for tasks seemingly unnecessarily complicated. If you can't devote several hours a day to FFXI, then it's really not worth playing.   For those willing to make the commitment, you'll find plenty of extra content, especially with the Xbox 360 version's inclusion of all the expansions. Rise of Zilart added a few advanced jobs and areas, Chains of Promathia added many new lands to explore. Aht Urhgan adds the Aht Urhgan empire, a new city, and most importantly, the Blue Mage, Corsair, and Puppetmaster jobs. Once you do the requisite quests to get these unlocked, you'll find they all have unique abilities. The Blue Mage, for instance, can absorb enemy spells and use them for his own attacks, whereas Puppetmasters actually get a companion that runs around with them to help out. These should be welcome additions to anyone out there who's been playing the game for years. To anyone new to the game, know that most of the additional content is high level stuff, so it won't affect you right out of the box.    Again, despite the dizzying array of gameplay options and explorable content, the system for doing so feels stale. Graphics don't fare much better. While this may have been one of the prettiest MMORPGs back when it was first released, it hasn't weathered the test of time very well. That being said, the Xbox 360 version still looks the best, which should be important to anyone out there who's been playing the PC and PS2 versions and looking for a visual upgrade. However, FFXI's sprawling environments are sparse and generally uninteresting to look at. Considering how much time you're going to spend staring at them, greater detail and sharpness would have been greatly appreciated. It's tough to envelop yourself in a fantasy world if you're constantly aware of how boring it looks. Character and enemy models animate smoothly, but still appear old and simplistic. You'll find the framerate drops down quite frequently, and environmental objects pop-up in the distance on a regular basis. FFXI's audio consists of standard Final Fantasy fare. Though it's held up better than the graphics, it still sounds dated.Since it's possible to play as your PS2 or PC characters on the Xbox 360, it's worth picking this one up if you're seeking a graphical upgrade. Of course, that's assuming you've already been playing the game previous to this release, own an Xbox 360 and an accompanying hard drive. Otherwise, it's best to stay away. If you're a curious Xbox 360 owner looking for a new role-playing experience, know that FFXI isn't what you're used to if you've never played an MMORPG. It's a game that requires hours of dedication on a near-daily basis. This wouldn't be a problem if the game was better, but unfortunately it comes off as unnecessarily inconvenient, clunky, and just plain old on the Xbox 360. If you've never played FFXI before, this version gives you little reason to start.", "date": "May 3, 2006"}
