Lara Croft's unrealistic proportions can only lead to further gender stereotyping and objectification of women. OK, I'll give you that, but don't forget that's a woman doing what most men couldn't. If that's not a strong woman, I don't know what is.   And if Tomb Raider's not a strong game, I don't know what is. It's got a great main character, immense levels, challenging puzzles and enemies, and (wait for it) a plot, something sorely lacking in most of today's shoot-em-ups. You are Lara Croft, wealthy British fortune hunter and seeker of lost relics. Your journey takes you into the ruins of ancient Inca civilization into the heart of demonic madness.   Lara controls like a dream. Many people may disagree with this point, but I find the control superb. Lara defaults to running, but can walk cautiously when the right shoulder button is used. This ~caution~ button comes in handy, especially when gauging jumps. The programmers wisely included a safety feature to keep you from flying off edges - keeping the caution button depressed will prevent from passing over the ledge. And when you're seventy feet up, trying to execute precarious jumps between thin ledges, you'll thank your lucky stars for that.   Level design is exceedingly impressive. One level can take you through tight caverns populated by crocodiles and wolves, into a wide-open Roman-style underground coliseum. The majority of the levels involve pulling switches in specific orders, in order to open doors to continue on. While this may sound dry on paper, it's anything but. It's fairly intuitive, yet challenging at the same time. In fact, most of the game has a familiar quality to it.   Tomb Raider's only real problem lies in the graphics. To be frank, the seams in the textures are glaringly noticeable. Some of the background images are also pretty chunky. These points aside, though, Tomb raider is one of the best games on 1996.", "date": "Dec 14, 1996"}
