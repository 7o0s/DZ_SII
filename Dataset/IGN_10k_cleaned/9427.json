This new Les Paul guitar feels like a million bucks. You get it out of the box, snap the neck into the base (so yes, you can transport it in your backpack now) and right away it's love at first strum. The new guitar has a weight to it lacking in all the previous Guitar Hero guitars, and looks and feels much more serious. Whereas before you felt like you were holding a toy, now you're much more inclined to think of it as an axe. It performs well too, certainly leaps and bounds ahead of the first Xbox 360 guitar, which - at least if ours were anything to go by - had a tendency to register a double strum if you were a little flamboyant in your playing. Which we, obviously, were. Plus, no more pointy bits! Yay.   So that's reason the first to buy Guitar Hero III. Reason the second, obviously enough, is that you now have a massive new playlist to learn and rock out to. In our minds it's not the best yet in the series (we still have a serious soft spot for the first title's selection) but it's damn good nonetheless, and with so many more master recordings this time around you'll spend a lot less time cringing at the cover band's performances.   Reason the third is simply that Neversoft - the new developer at the helm - has done a good job keeping the core essence of the game intact. While that means the team hasn't really tried to shake things up, at least it's quickly come up to speed on the series, and has churned out some pretty good tabulation for the vast majority of songs.     Let's take a quick look at some of the songs in the Career mode, which now comes complete with short Metalocalypse-style interstitials telling the story of your band's meteoric rise between gigs. There are a huge number of really solid, fun tracks. On the metal side of things there's Guns N' Roses' Welcome to the Jungle, Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast, Tenacious D's The Metal and yes, Metallica are finally accounted for, in the form of One. Then there's the awesome insanity of Muse's Knights of Cydonia, the sheer energy of Living Colour's Cult of Personality, the anthemic When We Were Young from The Killers and a whole lot of great rock. Mountain's Mississippi Queen, The Rolling Stones' Paint it Black, Aerosmith's The Same Old Song and Dance and ZZ Top's La Grange I'm looking your direction. Completing the line-up you even have the laidback noodling of Santana's Black Magic Woman, the cheesy goodness of The Scorpions' Rock You Like A Hurricane, and 'the word up track' (as it's known at IGN AU) - Cool Thing by Sonic Youth. Word up.   It's not all fun to play, however. As much as we like the Black Sabbath track Paranoid, it's a dud to play and nowhere near as much fun as the last two GH Sabbath tracks. Slayer's Raining Blood is also a disappointment to play, and we don't care if the Sex Pistols did re-record Anarchy in the UK for this game - we almost fell asleep playing it.   Still, on the whole it's a good lineup, and as usual there's a treasure trove of songs to be purchased with the filthy lucre you earn in the game. One aspect we really didn't like about Neversoft's Career mode, however, is the the way the rock legend challenges were handled. Don't get us wrong, we love the idea of having Slash and Tom Morello in the game, it's just that, well, the showdowns with the legends bite. The basic idea is that you face off against them before the encore at specific points during the Career mode and must utilise special attacks (earned by hitting specific runs of notes - much like building your star power normally) to disrupt their playing and knock them out. You'll hit them with busted strings, extra hard note placements and so on. It's just not that much fun. Win, and they look like idiots who can't play. Lose, and it's just frustrating because it's this artificial obstacle that's been inserted in the game.   This whole power-up concept has been turned into a full mode in the multiplayer section of the game, and frankly, that's where it belongs. It's a fun distraction against a friend, but it shouldn't be in the Career mode because ultimately all it does is take away from the purity of the challenge. Why we couldn't just jam with the legends to prove we had the guitar playing chops to compete, I'll never know.     Another big misstep in this game is the co-op Career mode. Sure, it sounds like a great idea to have a separate Career mode for co-op with a number of songs that are only unlockable in that mode... and then you get stuck with bass. Honestly, the bass parts in this mode simply aren't as much fun as playing lead guitar, and this is despite the fact that the developer has specifically picked the songs to suit the mode. We'll be interested to hear what you guys think because we didn't get more than three tiers through the co-op Career before going back to Face-off.    Co-op is also notable for having one of the most personality-less songs in the game to play. Whoever thought it was a good idea to put Sabotage by the Beastie Boys in this game was dead wrong. It's not even that we object to playing parts that clearly have nothing to do with guitars, it's just that this song sucks to play. No. Fun. Okay, so we have a few complaints, but really, Guitar Hero III is still great fun. The difficulty curve is very well judged, without the steep slopes that would rise up to smack you in the head in Guitar Hero I and II on PS2 (GH II on 360 was similarly smooth), and as with previous games, it's a lot more fun to play slightly above your skill level. Keep reachin' for that rainbow, in other words. Veterans will also find that the timing is a bit more generous in this installment than in previous games. It's actually just as much fun this way, so don't stress about the game being dumbed down. We're also big fans of Neversoft's style of tabulation  lots of runs of hammer-ons and pull-offs, as well as power chords in all their guises. Cool.", "date": "Nov 6, 2007"}
