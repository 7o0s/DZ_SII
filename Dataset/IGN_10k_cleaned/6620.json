Cosmic Infinity's new mobile game, Rocket Bowl, is based on a popular ~garage game~ by Large Animal games last year. In it, you roll a bowling bowl around a mini-golf course, trying to knock down ten pins instead of going for an itty-bitty hole. Oh, and with just the touch of a button, you can turn your bowling ball into a rocket-powered projectile, sending it smashing into the pins with extreme force.   It's good fun.   The courses are really laid out like mini-golf, with ramps and graded turf that affects how the ball rolls along. You may have a collection of pins around a right angle turn from the starting point, but if you can roll the ball with just enough power, you can get it to go up the incline and then roll back down ~around~ the corner and maybe pick up a few pins. There are narrow bridges over water that must be carefully navigated -- and aiming is made simple by controls mapped to the two soft keys. And then there are the rockets, which you can fire off to correct a bad throw and take out some pins elsewhere on the massive courses. (Cosmic promises more downloaded courses soon.)   You need to pick up more than spares in Rocket Bowl -- there are coins all over the courses, as well as ~money pins~ you can knock down to pick up extra cash. Use the dough to buy better bowling balls that have more rocket blasts and different colors.   Also slick: Online tournaments. You can join other players and compete for ranking on a worldwide leaderboard. I just checked out the scores today, and see that a few people have put me right to shame. I am sorrowful.  I really had a good time with Rocket Bowl. It's a slick, small game that you can pick up and enjoy for a few minutes or really dig into for a half-hour. The goofball concept really delivers on all of its promises -- firing rocket-powered bowling balls around a large course map, trying to knock down pins and not fall in the drink. And it's hard not to smile when you do go off-course and a chorus of female voices sings ~No!~", "date": "Feb 15, 2006"}
