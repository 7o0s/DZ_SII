My friends and I used to spend countless hours huddled around a pile of books and graph paper, enacting campaigns to rid the world of orks and daemons.  Hoping to capitalize on those geeks and former geeks who love role playing, Acclaim has released Iron & Blood, a fighter with a TSR license. People familiar with D & D will recognize the bulk of the 16 fighters. Elves, clerics, knights, and a host of evil beasties are all at the ready. With all these fighters there's over 250 moves, but most of these are fairly standard button pushed moves. The character style is done rather nicely, and stands out from the usual Tekken and Toshinden style characters.  However, its problems outweigh its assets. For starters, the enemy AI is abysmally poor. In one match, I watched, laughing hysterically, as the Skeleton Warrior repeatedly ran into the barrier wall, knocking himself (and his life meter) down. Because of the nature of the 3D arena, you repeatedly end up facing the wrong direction. This itself is not a problem, but the game won't let you correct this on your own. And since the computer is often slow at correcting the problem, you get hit in the back a lot.  Iron & Blood has a lot of problems, but it doesn't totally suck. In fact, it's kind of funny sometimes.
