Sin City is one of the undeniable icons of our age, a landmark of love, lust and loss that seems to exist in separation from the rest of the world. A place where what happens there, stays there  especially if what happens there is you losing all your money. Vegas Stakes is a game that came along in the early '90s and attempted to translate all that glitz, glamour and greed into a 16-bit SNES cartridge. Though it didn't hit the jackpot as a phenomenal success, its faithful adaptation of five classic casino games and scattered bits of story combined together to let the title at least break even. It's a game that won't blow you away, but if you're interested in an introduction to the world of gambling and addiction, Vegas Stakes could be your gateway drug.   A lone sports car speeds down the desert highways of Nevada, five friends inside chatting and scheming together about the big pay-off that will surely come their way soon. The fifth passenger is you yourself, the four others your compulsive companions. On arriving at the first casino, the Golden Paradise, you're given the choice of any of the four to accompany you to the casino floor, where they'll offer you advice, refresh your memory on the rules of each game, and lend some needed moral support should you be sent prematurely to the poorhouse.   Five games are available to play  Black Jack, the ~hit me~ card game where you try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over; Roulette, the game of chance signified by its spinning wheel of red and black numbers; Craps, the popular table game where one player rolls a pair of dice and others stand around placing bets on likely outcomes; Poker, likely the most popular and well known of them all, as you contend with five other players to create hands full of higher-ranking card combinations; and, finally, the Slot Machines, one-armed bandits that are the least complicated way to lose money that man's ever invented, as you simply insert cash, pull down a lever and watch pretty pictures of spinning fruit fly by before your eyes.   Now all you need is a styrofoam cup full of nickels.  It's a fair variety, but not an amazing one. While those five games do offer a good general representation of what's available to play in a standard casino, some of them are limited by a lack of variety. Roulette is always Roulette, sure, but Poker, for example, is always played a Seven-Card Stud in Vegas Stakes. There are plenty of other iterations of that game, and some of them, like Texas Hold 'Em, are far more popular here in 2007  in that way, Vegas Stakes does show its age as an artifact of an earlier era.   Additionally, the game doesn't do as good a job as it could in explaining some of the more complicated games. The friend characters that come along with you can be consulted at any time, but many of their descriptions seem cryptic, or at least geared toward players already familiar with the games in general. Vegas Stakes is happy to help you shoot Craps, but not so equipped as to help you learn Craps from scratch.   An interesting side feature the game includes is random interaction with other casino-goers. As you're playing along at any of the five different games, you'll be interrupted every once in a while by a seemingly innocent passer-by who asks for your assistance in some way. Maybe they've lost all their cash and need you to loan them some dough, promising to pay you right back. Or maybe they're wanting you to help them get their sick daughter to the hospital, or maybe any of another number of sob stories. Whether or not these characters are legit or not is determined randomly  you could help them, find out they were being truthful and then receive a large reward. Or you could help them, find out they were lying, and watch helplessly as they vanish with your hard-earned cash. Or you could just blow them off entirely, it's up to you. It's all another kind of gambling, really, in how you choose to respond to these individuals. And in that, Vegas Stakes is, in a way, home to a sixth kind of game.At the end of the day, Vegas Stakes neither turns in a loss or a significant gain  it simply is what it is, a casino sim with a fair variety of different gambling games and a bit of non-player character interaction thrown in as an aside. But as the first game of its type to hit the Virtual Console, it also serves as a potential proof of concept and call to action for digital download developers working on Wii. With WiiWare on its way next year, wouldn't a simple collection of casino games like this be a great, easy-to-execute idea? Update this concept with 16:9 and 480p graphics, introduce pointer control with the Wii Remote and sell it in the Shop for a reasonable pricetag of Points  it could be very lucrative for the developer who gets to market with it first. After all, there's real money to be made in offering gamers a way to gamble fake money away. And the current competition on Wii isn't in any condition to really compete.", "date": "Dec 7, 2007"}
