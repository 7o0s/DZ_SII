SNK seems to recognize this fact  with the system launch, the NeoGeo Pocket Color's library has consisted of baseball, soccer, and tennis  not a bad percentage for a 12 game launch. And what's more, these titles are actually really good  especially Pocket Tennis Color, a tennis game that's plays a hell of a lot like one of the best tennis titles ever, Super Tennis on the Super NES. Features Exhibition and Tournament modes Battery pack Two player via link cable Five locations For NeoGeo Pocket Color   Pocket Tennis Color is a straightforward tennis title with a few thrills  you can choose to play just a standard 1, 3, or 5 set match of tennis, or even better, head through a tournament ladder and win trophies. The game even saves your awards in memory for future viewing (via a trophy shelf...how cute).  Gameplay takes place in the standard overhead view, with you controlling one of nine different characters at the bottom half of the screen. In two-player link-cable mode, each player sees his player on the bottom half of the screen so as not to handicap one another. Control couldn't be easier  move your character with the joystick, and swing at the ball with the A (for strong volleys) or B (for weak volleys) buttons. If you push the joystick in a direction, you'll send the ball in that direction.  And you can dive for or spike the ball automatically if your character's in the appropriate position. The game is quick-and-dirty, very fast, and easy to pick up and play.  The graphics style is very Japanese (you know...big heads, small body), but that adds to the overall feel of the game. Pocket Tennis Color also features five different tennis courses. Most are just for looks, but one  the Canyon  actually plays differently. The course is wedged inside a canyon, and there are no out boundaries on the left or right  you can rebound a shot off the walls for a sneaky score. This is certainly a neat, raquetball-style addition. Of the three sports games on the NeoGeo Pocket Color, Pocket Tennis Color is definitely my favorite. It's a great game just to pick up and go through a tournament. My biggest complaint is the fact that it's easy to fake-out the computer opponents, even in the harder tournaments. Playing the game with another gamer is definitely the way to go. This is an excellent tennis game, and the only one  besides Super Tennis on the Super NES  that I'll keep playing.", "date": "Aug 14, 1999"}
