It's combination of balls-to-the-wall racing , coupled with pavement-eating fighting created a sub-genre that has never been successfully duplicated. I was lucky enough to really start getting into games around the time Road Rash came out, and so it was with gentile gleam in eye and shaky hand that I popped the Jailbreak CD in my PlayStation. A short minute later, the gleam was gone, and my hand was still shaking-in rage. Suffice it to say, Road Rash: Jailbreak is the same game I left in my childhood. Literally.    It's as if the game was ripped directly from the cart I spent so many years neigh-umbilically attached to, and plopped onto a CD. The control is there, the fighting is there, the speed is there, the crappy framerates are there, and the gritty graphics are there. It's all there, but with little in the way of innovation or originality. Everything that makes up Road Rash is here, but it's somehow lost its soul along the way. Road Rash: Jailbreak is fun, but not in the same way it used to be.    Gameplay  Road Rash is, at its heart, just a simple beat-em-up and a racer. Neither element is all that good by itself, but it's when they're brought together, like that prodigious moment when peanut butter met chocolate, that they become something truly greater than the sum of their parts. Road Rash wouldn't work if not for the perfect balance of racing and combat, and I'm proud to say that Jailbreak delivers, with the small addition of combos to the combat side and upgradeable bikes to boot.   The whole goal behind Jailbreak is to rise in rank through one of 2 gangs you pick until you can finally lead the charge to break the king of all bikers, Spaz out of jail, hence the title Road Rash: Jailbreak. Now depending on the gang you pick at the start of the game, you will either control a bad ass hog, or a slick, speedy crotch rocket. As you race, you'll earn better bikes  and weapons, but the competition gets the same benefits. The new bikes you earn as you rise through the ranks do feel different (this can range from tighter control to faster acceleration to higher top speed), especially after you've spent a fair amount of time on your old bike.    The single player game offers the chance to either stick to your roots as a hog- or crotch rocket-riding biker (Jail Break mode), or take to the streets as the nightstick wielding long arm of the law (Five-O mode). While it appears there are quite a few tracks, they're actually just various locales on a map linked by a stretch of road. For instance, you might travel from downtown to the lighthouse, or from the lighthouse to the dockyards, but the overall track still feels the same. Sure, the scenery changes at the start and finish, but the open road in between can usually be categorized as desert, city streets, or open country roads.   The real beauty of this series, however, has always been the multiplayer. Nothing beats the feeling you get after watching your best friend (or roommate, as the case may be) meet first your fist/chain/club/crowbar/whatever, then the pavement. What's more, Jailbreak offers the option of combos and multiple styles of attack with which to unload your choice of 9 weapons (including a super weapon that delivers a one-hit knockoff). There's even an option to have a buddy ride shotgun in a sidecar, dealing the smack down while you handle the driving.    Graphics Jailbreak's interface is simple, and uncumbersome, offering all the info you need on-screen without any real hunting. Unfortunately, the interface is about the only graphical area that will garner any positive comments. The in-game visuals so closely resemble the old 16-bit game that I had to actually whip out the old Genesis version to make sure they were any better (they were, but not by much). Now I understand that the graphic style of the Road Rash games is meant to be gritty and a little dark, but EVERYTHING looks like sandpaper. Everything from the road to the buildings, cars to sky looks like it was dithered down to about a 64-color palette (and in the age of Crash and Spyro, we all know that simple textures can look good, even flat shaded polys can suffice in some cases).    The riders and bikes, on the other hand, look great. Small touches in the animations, like the back wheel lifting off the ground after slamming the breaks, or the way the rider eases into his/her most streamlined position on straight-aways is great. Even the shadows look nice. It's when you combine these fantastic elements with the rest of the graphics that you really get a good picture of what COULD have been done to clean everything else up.   Sound EA actually held a contest for unknown and underground bands, offering the winners a spot on the soundtrack of what would become Jailbreak. Unfortunately, none of the songs are catchy enough to be memorable. They do mesh well with the on-screen action, but often just reduced to essentially white noise. Not only can I not remember the songs, I couldn't tell you where one ended and the next began if I was to hear them now.   The sound effects are good, however. The various bikes engine sounds are authentic, and sound great when you have to throttle back to take a corner, only to open 'er up again. Other sounds like the rival bikers' taunts get repetitive and are always obnoxious (I guess that's why they're taunts), but the overall punching, screaming, and honking is satisfactory.  The original Road Rash was the proverbial starlet; it had moxy. There was just a certain intangible ~it~ that made it fun to play. After nearly 10 years, the series is getting a little old, and even with a solid foundation in gameplay, Road Rash: Jailbreak just doesn't have ~it.~  This game's a definite rental, if only for the great 2 player modes and the fact that it's fun to pick up and play for a while. But the thin single player experience may leave you wanting more.", "date": "Feb 4, 2000"}
