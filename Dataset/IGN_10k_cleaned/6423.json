It seems like the game grows a little every week with new areas, new quests, new playable races and new...well, everything. But as if to say that they can't give everything away for free, they've recently released the first official retail expansion pack. Like the old original EQ expansions, the first EverQuest II expansion introduces several large zones and tons of new content.  The new expansion opens up the Isle of Ro. Players of the original EverQuest will remember the vast Desert of Ro and the dangers found therein. The new game positions Ro as a large island, full of Arabian-flavored dangers. Players can reach the island by taking a magic carpet from various locations in the rest of Norrath. Once you put down at the dock at the Sinking Sands, you can venture through two other large outdoor areas or head towards the massive city of Maj'Dul. There are plenty of new dungeons to explore as well. As you complete the various quests around the island you'll eventually gain access to even more of these areas.   The marketing materials seem to make too much out of the game's ~revolutionary vertical movement.~ It's hardly the first MMO to offer players the chance to exploit the Z-axis -- even the original EverQuest offered vertical movement. Still, there are plenty of walls and cliffs in the Desert of Flames and you'll be mighty glad that you can scale them, particularly when you're being devoured by non-climbing crocodiles. You can only climb in established locations however, so it may take you a while before you discover a route up to a lonely plateau. Small visual cues can help you spot them.  Far from being an expansion to bring new players into the fold, Desert of Flames focuses on rewarding veteran players with even more high-level content. From my perspective this makes total sense. Rather than trying to cater to new subscribers, the EQ2 team has decided to extend the enjoyment of the game for their most dedicated current players.  First, the expansion raises the current level cap from 50 to 60, giving veteran players much more room to grow. Getting from 50 to 60 will take quite a while (remember 40 to 50?) so older players will definitely get their money's worth from this one. The challenge level is quite high here. Not only are all the mobs 45th level or higher, but many of them actually skew a little higher during combat. You can gauge the danger level of a given mob thanks to the more refined con system.  The challenge level means that low-level players probably won't have too much to do in Desert of Flames. Still, since you can reach the city of Maj'Dul right from the docks, you can feel free to engage in the new PVP options available at the arena. The arena combat allows players to engage in a variety of team-based games. Deathmatch and capture the flag mode are available as is a more original mode where each team has to destroy an idol located in their enemy's starting zone. You can jump into arena combat either with your own character or with a variety of creature idols you can buy and collect throughout the island (see: Pokemon) . This is a good first step but more needs to be done with PVP. The good and evil separation in the game is still pretty meaningless. Sure, you can get your short-term fix with these arena games (and they certainly help to pass the time for higher level players) but the PVP gameplay just isn't as integrated into the rest of the experience as it ought to be.       Though the arena is an interesting attraction, it's not nearly as attractive as the three-way faction fighting that takes place in the city of Maj'Dul itself. There are three factions to work with here -- the Court of Blades, the Court of Coin and the Court of Truth. Basically these groups are focused on military, mercantile or magisterial concerns. Gaining favor with one faction is sure to put you in bad with the others so you'll have to pick one and stick with it. Rewards for faction loyalty are pretty predictable --  extra quests, access to new vendors and the like. If you run out of faction-specific quests, there are plenty of generic quests you can run for any of the factions.  What's really great about this though is that the factions openly fight in the streets and encourage you to do the same. This makes some areas of the city fairly hostile but there's a group of rug-riding sorcerers who act as police when things get out of hand. Even the highest level groups will have trouble standing up to their attacks.   EverQuest II is still one of the best-looking MMOs around and Desert of Flames fits in well with the existing game's visuals, both in terms of style and quality. Personally, I'm still not crazy about the extremely realistic visuals but the Desert of Flames is a bit more colorful and fanciful than the rest of the world, so it makes for a nice change of pace. Add in the spot-on Arabian flair and the expansion becomes even more attractive.  Though you won't really see many new effects here, the new creatures and locations are original enough to add some spark to the existing engine. Seeing sunsets over a ridge of red mountains or talking with a naga in front of a gold-rimmed mirror that shows a shimmering world beyond definitely brings a sense of wonder and magic to the experience.  In terms of audio, you're not going to notice a wealth of changes. There are plenty of new ambient sounds that bring the deserts to life, but in terms of dialogue and music, the new expansion doesn't really add that much to the experience. COMMENTSDesert of Flames is a sure hit for high-level players. There's so much content here for the 45+ crowd that you could easily fill out the rest of your levels just on the Isle of Ro. Low level players can safely hold off on the expansion until they find themselves bumping their heads on the current game's level cap. The Arabian theme is quite effective and adds a little variety to the overall experience, both in terms of looks and content.", "date": "Nov 23, 2005"}
