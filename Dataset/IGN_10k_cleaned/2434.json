Featuring a really strong sense of moral autonomy and a compelling AI, it more than lived up to our expectations. Now, nearly a year later, Lionhead Studios has released the first expansion for Black & White, entitled Creature Isle.    For those that haven't read the preview, have forgotten about it already or are just a little slow, Creature Isle places you in a world with no other gods. Instead, the island is home to several masterless creatures. These creatures have banded together in a Brotherhood and require all new creatures to pass a series of trials in order to gain admittance. The trials were instituted in order to weed out the bad creatures from the good. Presumably, if you can play soccer, you are good. As you best each of the creatures in their individual challenges, you earn their support for entry into the Brotherhood. You also get the chance to switch your current creature out for the new creature type.    While there are villages and populations to manage, Creature Isle was designed to focus almost exclusively on the creatures of Black & White. Much more attention has been placed on the care and maintenance of your creature and his or her ability to display independent initiative in solving the various problems around the island. Sadly, the lack of a directly competing god tends to spoil the enjoyment for me as I'm sure it will for fans of the game who were more interested in the strategic side of Black & White.    Each of the 20 or so creatures in the game has a unique and intense personality. And while much of the personality comes through the voice acting and dialogue of the characters, even more comes from the animation and modeling. The various creatures all look and move like individuals. There are a few oddities here, such as Pristax the Leopard. He speaks with a very proper British accent but also launches into a breakdancing routine. Now, I'm not saying that the worm and the headspin aren't big over at Eton these days, but it still seems a bit off. And the less said about Yax, the red-assed Jamaican Baboon, the better.    The challenges themselves are a bit tedious and some of them seem out of character for the game. Right at the start you have to compete with Madino the Cow in a bowling match. This is probably the most irritating of the games in Creature Isle. You have to throw a small stone at a group of pins. Your creature throws the ball wherever the stone lands. You play through five frames against the cow. It's a very slow-paced game -- the moreso because it's intercut with lots of cutscenes and reactions to the shots.    Then there's the issue of whether or not a bowling game belongs in a game that's supposed to be about a divine entity. I kind of have the same objections about the Candyland-style challenge and the game of marbles that you play against Jango the Ape. If the developers are trying to make a point about God playing dice with the universe, it could have been done more subtly. If they're trying to say something about the innocence or immaturity of the creatures, then that might have been handled better as well. I'm not saying that the game can't have humor or levity in it. That's not my point at all. What seems odd to me is that the first game seemed to deal with the issues of godhood with a lot more sophistication and ~reality~ than this one does.    But to be fair, there are many contests that fit perfectly within the context of the world. Helping people remove curses, gathering a crew to help transport Kula the Polar Bear to a cooler climate and stopping marauders from destroying buildings all seem to make sense within the world of the game. Playing marbles or soccer tends to take away from the profound nature of the first game, but helping out the villagers is still a satisfyingly godlike experience.    Some of the contests require persistence rather than skill. You'll have to herd sheep into a pen by using their natural aversion to your creature to guide them. The sheep don't seem to recognize the presence of your creature until he's stopped for a second or two so you'll probably have to stop well ahead of the sheep to get them to turn and run in the opposite direction. A wolf asks you to play hide and seek. Since you can still see his footprints, you just have to follow him around the island until he ~hides.~    Other contests just require that you find the gimmick or trick that makes them possible. The tortoise race is remarkably easy once you realize that you can cut across a large portion of the track. Not all the tricks are as apparent as this one, and I'll leave it to you to figure out just how in the hell you get past those guard dogs to rescue Nazzle the Bear.   A few competitions require only that you have taught your creature to do the ~right~ things, like watering farms for instance. Your creature can also learn a few new skills in Creature Isle. First, and maybe most importantly, he can learn to construct buildings. This is a big leg up in multiplayer as it allows you to get you village pumping in a short period of time. Your creature also has two new miracles: an anti-spell miracle and a haste miracle.    You'll really begin to see how well you've taught your creature when he begins to take care of Tyke, the little chicken that you'll have to hatch early in the game. Tyke learns by watching your creature and, once he knows what to do, can be a big help in regulating and modifying your villages. Tyke learns the lessons your creature teaches him pretty quickly and is quite good at putting them into practice. I didn't see as much of a moral dimension to their relationship as I did between me and my own creature in the first game but that may just be because I projected most that stuff onto the relationship myself.    The ultimate goal in raising Tyke and completing the various creature trials is to win the approval and affection of Eve. Eve's a mysterious character motivating things behind the scenes. I could say more about this but it would tend to spoil a lot of the game. I'll just say that pretty much the whole game builds towards this meeting with Eve. Whether or not the payoff is worth it depends on how much you enjoyed getting there.    I definitely recommend the game to fans of Black & White. Heck, it'll probably be fun for people who haven't played the first game yet (although they'd need a copy of it at least to play the expansion). But the real appeal of the game is in the nurturing and maintenance of your creature which, for me at least, isn't necessarily the best aspect of the first game. A second expansion was proposed some time back entitled Super Gods which focused more on the strategy of village management and intra-deity rivalries. It looks like most of those ideas have been folded into the upcoming Black & White 2 so, in the meantime Creature Isle is all you'll get.    -- Steve Butts            Want to share your opinions with the world?
