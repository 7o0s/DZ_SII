What did you really want, besides the obvious tennis-playing and target-shooting? We hoped for games that would let you actually be a part of them  stretch a hand out towards something far away, turn keys in locks, twist and fit components into broken machinery, physically thwack monsters around the chops, poke things in the eye. We hoped for items we could physically use, rocks we could actually throw. Not minigames involving vigourous one-handed pumping whilst pointing at an arbitrary target with the other.   So close, and yet so far  Zack and Wiki is a terrible tease.  Zack and Wiki lets you do all of the above and more. It lets you saw down trees, push things over, turn and twist and hammer and poke things to your heart's content. It lets you rock a baby dragon in your hands, or pull its tail, mix up potions, deface portraits with a huge inky broom, irk monsters with a pointy stick, answer telephones and listen to messages, turn handles and play flutes, all with your own hands. It's the best use of the Wii controller we've ever seen, and Capcom's imaginative cleverness here surpasses even Nintendo's own. Gorgeous, funny and inventive, this game is one of the best reasons there is to own a Wii, and you barely need to play it for an hour to see why.    Right from the off, the game grabs your attention with its bright and playful style. Its cartoon violence is much more slapstick than sweet, and it pulls off visual humour better than anything we've seen in years. There'll be many a time where you'll let out a laugh as kid-pirate hero Zack falls victim to an unfortunate mishap, whether he's pancaked by a massive boulder, gobbled by a monster fish or chucked off a cliff by an angry monkey. Everything about the game is tinged with playful humour, from the mildly unhinged plot to the inspired cartoon animation and  especially  the puzzles, whose solutions are invariably both ingenious and amusing enough to paint a massive grin on our gormless faces.   Dont try to poke this rock robot in the eye with a stick. It doesnt end well.  Point-and-click adventure games like Monkey Island have long been famed for their humour and Zack and Wiki follows in their footsteps in more ways than one. It's essentially an old-fashioned item-based puzzle game, but with a modern twist in the form of the Wii controls and unique puzzle design. The game's story sees kid-pirate Zack and his monkey companion Wiki racing against rival pirates in a search for the 24 gold pieces of the infamous pirate Barbaros  who, unsurprisingly, was cursed for his naughtiness and now lives on as a talking gold skull. It differs from most other item-based adventures though because it's split up into around thirty unique, manageable levels instead of one massive narrative whole.   Each completely unique scenario simply shows you an inaccessible chest, a level-full of monsters and items to utilize, then plonks you straight down to have a go. Everything can be played with  it's figuring out what to do in what order that's the challenge. In addition to thosee rocks, planks, levers and machinery lying about, different animals and rival-pirate lackeys can also be 'itemised' by ringing Zack's bell with a shake of the remote, turning rampaging boars into mallets, frogs into bombs and bats into umbrellas with a puff of smoke. They can also be turned back, which adds whole new levels to the puzzles later on in the game as you run about turning snakes into arm-lengthening gripper things and back again at useful moments.     What makes it great is the sheer variety and inspired puzzle design. If you were following a walkthrough (thus ruining everything for yourself, incidentally, you massive idiot), then none of Zack and Wiki's levels would take much more than five to ten minutes to complete. But while you're figuring them out yourself, experimenting with different items and contraptions and possible solutions, they can take anything from twenty minutes to upwards of an hour. You'll often make mistakes, frequently starting over, but thanks to the game's ingenious structure, it never takes more than a few minutes to get back to where you were. It even has a pay-per-use hints option and a revive system that lets you restart from moments before your last mistake, further easing the pain for softer players  although those who'd rather figure things out for themselves have no obligation to use it. It makes the occasional occurrence of trial-and-error puzzles completely forgivable.   Zack and Wiki is great because it knows what you want from the Wii. It knows you want a giant playset in which you can pick everything up and throw it around like a five-year-old child. It's boundlessly interactive, playful and mischievous; it teases you with a right answer for ages before telling you to think again, and never ceases to surprise with every new level. Some are long and complex, some short but nonetheless fiendish  some are action-based, some leave you thinking at your own slow pace. In fact, the final stages all but abandon previous puzzle-solving yet still work admirably, which is great evidence of its adaptability.   Visually, this is typical Capcom flair. Its beautifully consistent.  Perhaps the main downside to Zack and Wiki is that it has to come to an end. After about ten hours of unique, inspired puzzles, the story finishes, and the very nature of the game means that it's not much suited to replay. However, obviously aware of this defect, Capcom has tucked away hundreds of trinkets and secrets around the game world, hidden in devious places  collecting every classic Capcom treasure and optional bonus could last a very long while indeed, and you'll find yourself returning to levels just to re-live that particular laugh-out-loud set-piece or ingenious Wii remote moment. It's a rare game that manages to be pretty much continuously fun and inspired for every single second, and we'd much rather it was this long and this excellent than twice the length and padded out with mediocre filler  or arm-pumping mini-games.Ultimately, Zack & Wiki is exactly what the Wii was designed for  a joyous game that mixes classic, near-perfect level design with a brilliantly-implemented new control system  and it simply could not exist on any other console. Not a fan of humour and imagination? Prefer games with grey bricks, grey sky and brown ground as opposed to cute cartoonishness? Then Zack and Wikis not for you, and youre missing out. Everyone else will find more than enough to love about this innovative, mischievous, fantastically well-designed adventure puzzler to justify the purchase price.", "date": "Jan 14, 2008"}
