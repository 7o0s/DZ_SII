It's not difficult to make that assumption on first looks, but after playing the game it's obvious that the game is its own design. The pinball engine offered in The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy is a decent one, but in terms of interest I think that the past Nintendo games have the upper hand.FeaturesTwo pinball tables16 mini-pinball tablesAdjustable speed and difficultyBattery saveRumble CartridgeOnly for Game Boy ColorThis licensed release for the Game Boy Color was made to coincide with the direct-to-video release of The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea, the sequel to the animated classic released in 1989. The game has two distinct pinball tables, the first one based on the original, and the second table featuring a design from the videotape/DVD sequel. Each of the tables in the game have at least one ramp, plenty of curves and bumpers, several dropshots, a bunch of targets, a couple kickback saves, and multiple (snicker-snicker) flippers. There's plenty of stuff (i.e. bonus points, timer skillshots) to uncover depending on the combinations you perform hitting the ol' silver ball around the field, and it's your task to figure out what aimed shot will do what. This is modern pinball, after all -- it's not about simply keeping the ball alive as long as possible anymore.To keep the action flowing without repetitiveness, the designers created sixteen mini pinball games that must be unlocked to access -- and this is one of the tricks to the game. Each of these mini-games is based on a scene from either movie -- Kiss the Girl, for example, challenges you to hit six fish circling the boat with the Prince and Ariel...get the fish to flow water like a fountain, and you've won. In another, you have to sadistically knock tiny sailors off a sinking boat and then ~rescue~ them by hitting the silver ball at them. The designers did a good job capturing scenes from the film -- at least the first one. I've never seen the sequel, so I can only guess.The main pinball boards are decently designed, but even with all the things going on, they both seem a bit drab. In its favor, the game does feature multiball action -- something that Pokmon Pinball didn't have. You can have as many as three balls going around the field at once, which gives the game a very maniacal feel to it. Since the game is more tailored for kids, there are plenty of kickback saves and returned balls, which unfortunately reduces the challenge a bit. That, plus the pinball physics are a little on the floaty side -- you can up the speed of the ball at the beginning of the game, but even then it feels like the table isn't slanted harsh enough. Whenever you hit the ball, it feels more like a push.Little Mermaid is a decent pinball game, but it's not the best. I prefer Kirby's Pinball Land over Pokmon Pinball, and Pokmon Pinball over this one. The added extras are a definite plus -- whenever you uncover a mini-board, you can access it at any time from the main menu. You can even print out little pictures on the Game Boy Printer -- if you've got one, that is. But my main gripe is with the ball-action -- it's just not as quick as the previous pinball incarnations. Still, for the market it's tailored to, Little Mermaid is a great title for the girl gamer -- for video pinball wizards, it's a nice diversion.", "date": "Sep 29, 2000"}
