As if the movie sequel wasn't enough, now there's a way for you to enjoy demonic possession and otherworldly experiences from the comfort of your expensive office chair in your high rise office with your ultimate computer system. As you probably know already, Gathering of Developers is putting out not one, not two but three titles based on Blair Witch, using the Nocturne engine. While it's a perfect fit in terms of shadow and style, you'll quickly find when playing the first of the three games, Rustin Parr, that there's a different sort of curse going on in the world of Blair Witch. While Rustin Parr delivers its own share of chills with an intriguing storyline, it's also brought down by the exact same problems that cursed Nocturne last year.But let's not deal with the horror just yet. Rustin Parr is more than just a Blair Witch game made using the Nocturne engine -- it's also a combining of both storylines, with Doc Holiday from Nocturne being sent to investigate an occult-like murder of children in the small town of Burkittsville. Rustin Parr killed seven children, sparing the eighth, before returning to town and confessing to the murders. Sound familiar? The best thing about Rustin Parr the game is that it takes small parts of the fledgling Blair Witch myth and fleshes it out into its own story, one that for the most part works better than the original movie.Doc Holiday's a lot different than the original star of Nocturne, the Stranger, but she works perfectly for the mostly adventure-based Rustin Parr. You're limited in the amount of weapons that you'll use in the game, but you do have the completely new addition of a notebook that holds pictures, clues, and conversations of key importance in the game. Doc's more a sleuth than a slaughterer, so the focus is as much about talking to the townspeople and collecting clues as it is about tossing some bullets at the undead. Because the three titles are budget priced, they're also budget-sized as well. The game takes place entirely in town and in the nearby forest, with the forest holding only a handful of key locations that you must visit. The town is rendered in the fantastic detail that made Nocturne shine, something apparent the minute you check out the dimly lit diner, or the motel office. As with the original game, the pre-rendered objects are all rendered in 3D as well, meaning that while the backgrounds don't move dynamically as polygonal backgrounds would, the lighting of your flashlight reacts to the objects as if they were in full 3D. The effect is as eerie and excellent as in Nocturne, particularly in the forest where you've got to rely on your small light to make your way through the deliberately confusing forest. The game does a pretty good job at unraveling the storyline, which reveals quite a bit about the history of the woods, of the Blair Witch, and the true story of Rustin Parr. But the adventure elements end up feeling a bit simplistic, particularly when Doc Holiday will repeat all important clues and information out loud to herself in incredible detail after every major event. It certainly keeps the game from getting too confusing, but it also ends up making the game feel more like an interactive movie, where it's your job to simply move the character to the next triggered event. In fact, that's what a lot of Rustin Parr ends up becoming -- chase down a character before they reach a certain screen, find a particular character in a location and speak to them, etc. Rarely, if ever, are you called upon to solve puzzle. Instead, it's simply your job to talk to the right people, get the specific instructions, and make your way to the specified location at the right time. This becomes particularly apparent when you venture into the forest, one of the most frustrating (and unfortunately, the largest) parts of the game. Take an elaborate maze puzzle from the end of your average adventure game, multiply by two, divide by a third and you've got about 80% of the Blair Witch game. It's a shameless way to flesh out a game that could have been filled with honest gameplay. Instead, you're treated to events such as special occasions when the Blair Witch suddenly pulls you into a dark section of the forest, where it's your job to simply run around the area for an unspecified time until you appear back in the area where you left off. Like the movie, you'll find yourself lost in the forest completely because of the Witch's meddling, but instead of feeling scared you'll simply feel frustrated. Add to this the fact that the game purposely sends you on long, repeated runs through the mazelike forest to retrieve the smallest of items, and you'll begin to loath the forest less for the dangers, and more for the sheer tedium. The Blair Witch isn't take revenge on trespassers, she's just pissed off that she can't seem to find her way out of the damn forest. If this was a small block of the game it would be one thing, but to wrap your entire title around one of gaming's top ten least-loved  clich's and you've got yourself in a mound of trouble. We promise you, no mine cart sections, however.The action portion of the game also suffers, mainly due to the combination of wonky controls and bad camera tricks that ensure your demise on a regular basis. While you can use a keyboard to control your character, you'll quickly want to move over to a mouse for steering, or you'll never be able to aim quick enough to flay your foes. Of course, this makes running a little awkward, but believe me, you'll hate the alternative. The camera is a nightmare however, switching angles at seemingly random intervals, and following Murphy's law to the letter, any time a monster is about to attack you. The action is a little more even in pacing this time around (Nocturne was famous for throwing you in tiny spaces with tons of crap-hard foes), and you'll usually have more than enough space to run past a monster, spin around, and fire off a few shots... if you have the ammo, of course. Your best bet in the forest is to simply run away, and keep a close eye on your map. Sure, that means that you'll most likely have five demon dogs chasing you at a time, but it also guarantees that you'll have bullets for when you need them most. The auto-aiming has been improved from Nocturne, but there are still some bad pathing problems with creatures. I was caught in horrible loops three or four times in the space of an hour, with a zombie chomping on my character, but never releasing her. That being said, the new enemies introduced in the game are full of incredible animation and life -- though to be honest, there are really only two or three new monsters that you'll be battling in the game. So all in all, Rustin Parr is a smaller twin to it's cousin Nocturne, plagued by the same problems, only moreso. While the story is actually pretty nice to follow in Rustin Parr, the game gives you two dial settings for entertainment -- tedious, and infuriating. When you aren't screaming about the annoying difficulty in some of the simplest monsters in the game, or your general lack of good weaponry to deal with the situation, you'll be wondering how many more times you'll have to run through the entire forest again to find an object to deliver all the way to the other side of the forest. Finally, what's most unforgivable about Rustin Parr is that the title is plagued by the same exact problems that drove the original Nocturne down, only there's been a year in between the games, in which some fixes could have been made. Random crashes are still abundant, the pathing is laughable at points, and while the auto-aim feature seems to have been greatly improved, the wonky control scheme still exists, as well as the random camera. Underneath the frustration lies an impressive engine and some pretty good ideas, but unfortunately, they don't come through in Rustin Parr.Rustin Parr isn't a flop -- it's a pretty good attempt to try to translate the creepiness of the Blair Witch game to the computer screen. The darkness and creepiness of the forest is handled like no other game, and the frights, while in no way comparable to your average horror shocker on the big screen, are still pretty successful. Unfortunately, it becomes bogged down in itself in the process, and what you've got left is a brief, frustrating, and ultimately unsatisfactory gaming experience.-- Vincent LopezWant to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.", "date": "Oct 18, 2000"}
