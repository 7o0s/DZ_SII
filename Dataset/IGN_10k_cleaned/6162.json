There's just something about the historical nature of the games that appeals to me. To be fair, I think elves and space marines are neat too, but I think it's more exciting to explore the what ifs of real, historical situations. Though not quite as faithful to ~reality~ as some strategy games, the first two Age games offered us exciting sojourns into the worlds of ~capital A~ Ancient and Medieval strategy. The third title, Age of Mythology, proved that the mechanics were just as solid even if the historical inspiration was a little loose.Now Ensemble is back on the history train with the third official Age of Empires game. Age of Empires III moves the action to the New World, letting players lead a variety of European nations from the Age of Discovery through the Industrial Age. Eight playable nations battle across a wide variety of geographies -- from the swamps of Florida to the snowy passes of the Rocky Mountains. Players can recruit different Native American tribes and seize control of various trade routes. Material and technological support will be offered by the player's home city back in Europe.The 24-mission campaign is very well designed. Divided into three large acts, it tells the story of three generations of the Black family. First Morgan Black, a Knight of St. John races to the New World to stop the Spanish from seizing a powerful natural wonder. Next, Morgan's grandson John and his Native American allies find themselves in the Seven Year's War. The final act shows John's granddaughter Amelia as the head of a railroad company making their way west.I won't spoil the particulars of the story here but a common quest and a common enemy unite all three acts. The connections aren't always clear at first, but the associations start to build as the game goes on. Putting the pieces together isn't terribly hard but it gives a nice sense of purpose to the whole game and keeps you invested in the action.While we're talking about the game's story, it's refreshing to see a game that covers this era of warfare without referencing either Napoleon or the American Revolution. While both are fertile ground for strategy game developers, it's nice to get something a little different this time around. Meeting Washington and Bolivar and taking part in the Seven Year's War adds a little authenticity as well as variety. On the other hand, some of the choices -- like finding Russians in Colorado -- may leave gamers scratching their heads in wonder.The range of missions is pretty broad. There are plenty of defense missions where you have to protect a given structure or a whole town from enemy assault. In other cases you'll have to destroy or capture key structures. Along the way there are plenty of other objectives: rescuing captured settlers, seizing trading posts, liberating Native American settlements and a whole host of other tasks. Better still, many missions combine a variety of these objectives at once. While most of the missions let you build a base and start collecting resources, there are some missions where you have to make do with a set number of troops.Outside of the single player campaign, Age of Empires III benefits from a very soild multiplayer interface. A few simple clicks take you to ESO2, Ensemble's online matchmaking service. Finding and joining games is remarkably easy and there are a wide variety of options to choose from. Different starting eras and resource levels will let players jump into as advanced a game as they want. The AI offers up a few taunts from time to time to (sort of) replicate the personality of a human player. It's a nice trick honestly, but the AI can't even approach the level of smack talking that goes on among the IGN editors.LoadingPlayIn general the AI is very strong. You can find some exploits here and there but, for the most part, the AI knows how to make a good army and how to lead it. While the computer opponents in some RTS games send out trickles of units from time to time in order to keep things interesting, the AI in Age of Empires III tends to rely more on groups of units and will hardly ever use them in pointless, suicide attacks. In my games the AI has had a good handle on when to press an attack and when to retreat. The only real weak point in the AI is its tendency to leave some of its settlers too isolated. (Since there are no resource dropsites anymore, it's also hard for human players to keep tabs on where all their settlers are.)The range of technologies and units is relatively broad here. In the early ages, players will have to make do with troops that are very similar to the medieval set from Age of Empires II. Crossbows eventually give way to muskets as the ages pass by. Soon players will be fielding long lines of musketeers and using mortars to bombard enemy towers. While it may seem that some of the unit types are redundant, you'll find that each type has a specific role to play on the battlefield. Like the other Age games you'll have a variety of ranged and melee-focused cavalry and infantry as well as a nice range of artillery units. Identifying the counter units and building a balanced force is just as important as knowing where and when to strike the enemy.Like the rest of the games in the Age series, the naval element is merely there to support the land battles. The handful of ships and maritime technologies don't offer many options. You will find that the naval side of the game is fairly compelling early on while you're dealing with pirates and chasing your enemies across the Atlantic. Once you start fighting in the interior of the American continent, you won't really miss the naval aspect of the game as much.Pathfinding seems to be a bit of a problem here and there. Huge formations can easily find their way through the most densely packed settlements but my one hero unit can't seem to find his way out of the middle of a line of infantry. There are cases where the pathfinding is a little too good. Units are able to predict the best routes through a maze even when large parts of that maze haven't been uncovered yet. This is most telling during missions where you're leading a small force through a series of winding canyons. As long as you click on their eventual destination, they'll make their way through the labyrinth with nary a wrong turn.While we're on the subject, it seems odd that you can't select a single unit out of a group by clicking on their portrait at the bottom of the screen. Trying to grab a specific hero unit out of a large formation should be easier than this. Luckily, there's an option in the game to disregard any non-combat units when you click and drag to select a group. This helps to keep your settlers from marching out with your soldiers.Age of Empires III also introduces some new elements -- home cities, native tribes, trade routes and such. Taken individually none of these are profound innovations but their cumulative effect makes the game feel fresh and strengthens the appeal of the core design.What's the best treasure in Age of Empires 3?A new pet, like a tigerA fat sack of gold coinsI like to get woodThe Shield of El Pollo GuapoThe Armor of ArkantosAnswerSee ResultsPlayers can visit the Home City screen to request a wide variety of shipments -- either crates of resources, soldiers, settlers, or military and economic improvements. The number and type of shipments you can get depend on the amount of experience you've earned during the mission and the advancement level of your town center. I like the way new, more powerful shipment types open up later in the game because it tends to keep things in the right proportion. Being able to get 13 musketeers late in the mission is as significant as getting two settlers at the very beginning. In between missions, you'll be able to purchase new shipment types, giving your Home City even more options for support.What makes the Home City most attractive is that it allows players to strengthen particular aspects of their game on the fly. If you need a resource boost early on, you can ship crates of wood, gold or food right to your town center. If you'd rather build resources over the long term, you can ship over a technology that lets you collect a particular resource faster. If resources aren't a problem, you might consider shipping over a tech that lets you train units faster. If you need units and are short on resources, you can just ship over a few troops. While Age of Empires III doesn't really allow for a quick rush, getting a leg up early on can really give you an advantage.Allying with Native American tribes also gives you an advantage over your allies, particularly if you combine this strategy with some key Native American improvements from your Home City. Even if you do opt for this approach, aligning yourself with a Native American tribe merely gives you a handful of unit types. Your trading post basically serves as a different type of barracks, not a whole other settlement. Strangely, the Native American tribes are almost never hostile towards you. Just build a trading post and they'll instantly give you access to all their troop types and technologies. While you can destroy an enemy's trading post, players can't destroy (or even attack) the Native American settlements themselves.LoadingPlayThere are plenty of other opportunities to secure an advantage. Trade routes run through many of the maps, with trading posts located at intervals along the route. Players can claim these posts and earn regular resource payments from them. Like most aspects of the game, you can upgrade even these trade routes turning simple wagons into large freight trains. If you're sufficiently advanced, you can even pick which resources are brought in by wagon or train, giving you a chance to bolster dwindling supplies.A variety of small treasures can be found on the maps as well. These are always guarded by a band of outlaws/bears/wolves/etc. If you can eliminate the defenders, you can claim the reward with your hero units. In some cases, you'll just get a small resource injection. In other cases, you may receive new units. Still other cases grant your units some kind of ability bonuses. While these small treasures aren't vital, they help add a little color and excitement to the game.Speaking of color and excitement, Age of Empires III looks quite good for an RTS game. There aren't fireballs or laser blasts flying around here but the artists have done a great job making the most of the historical source material here. Buildings are wonderfully detailed, units are dressed in colorful uniforms, smoke from musket volleys, cannon balls splashing in the water -- all these effects conspire to create a completely believable visual presentation.Water effects and lighting are particularly good here. You can't tell from the screenshots, but these two aspects of the visual appeal of the game look very natural during the game's action. Seeing the long shadows of a group of marching troops or watching the small ripples of water as parts of your enemy's ship are blown off really makes the game come alive. The explosions are also quite good but the actual destruction of buildings seems a little scripted. Knowing that the tower on a town center will always fall the same way at the same pointing each attack takes away from a bit of the excitement.The units move and fight very naturally. I quite like watching the musket-armed troops stop firing and begin jabbing their bayonets into an approaching cavalry formation. You'll also notice that the cannon crews will go through the motions of reloading and firing each shot. Naturally you can't spend too much time appreciating the small things when a battle is raging but it's still worth checking out from time to time.You'll have a lot more leisure to watch the awesome cinematics. Though the individual missions are introduced by in-game cutscenes, there are great movies at the beginning and end of each act. The production values here are very high with great staging, lighting and excellent detail overall.Though the physics are a nice touch, it's really just eye-candy. While it's great to see trees knocked down when cannon fire rips through a forest, the trees themselves don't seem to hurt any units standing below. Ditto for the huge chunks of buildings that are sent flying by cannon fire. While it would make the game a bit more complicated, having units unaffected by these visual elements is a little distracting.The sounds in Age of Empires are quite good but it doesn't stand out separately from the graphics or gameplay. The music and dialogue serve the story and action well and the effects add a little weight to the combats. My only real gripe about the sound is that there aren't enough vocal cues. You'll constantly need to keep track of all your units because they won't warn you if, say, they're being devoured by wolves while you're busy figuring out just where to build your church.Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition was released in 2020. See our full review to see how it turned out.LoadingPlayAge of Empires III is a superbly balanced and polished game and it definitely ups the ante for the C&C and 'Craft developers. Discounting a few niggles in the interface, the whole presentation is rock solid. Each new release in the Age of Empires series has added something to the mix. But while Age of Empires II seemed to focus on quantity, Age of Empires III sacrifices some units and civilizations in order to make the whole experience much tighter.The graphics are definitely the first thing you'll notice about Age of Empires III. While they're definitely an easy selling point, the real appeal lies in the gameplay itself. The unit design and the range of opportunities in both the single player and multiplayer missions will definitely get your strategic juices flowing. There wasn't a single slow moment in the campaign, from leading the knight's defense of Malta to securing trade routes from a rival railroad company centuries later. Moving on to multiplayer, there are so many choices for you to make that you can't help but be excited by the open-ended format of the game.", "date": "Oct 14, 2005"}
