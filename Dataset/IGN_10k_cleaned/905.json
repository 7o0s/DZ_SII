Call me an old-school gamer, but I love the pick-up-and-play style  it wasn't a simulation, more just a game that abridged the game into a five-on-five arcade style game. And with the Game Boy Color so close in capabilities to the NES, it's no wonder that Konami would base its portable basketball series on the NES game. Problem is, the controls are so clunky and the AI is so bad, that I'd rather make the effort of getting out the old system and digging out the classic Double Dribble than playing this game again. Features NBA Teams and Players Exhibition, Season, Playoff modes Shootout mini-game Battery back-up Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Color NBA In the Zone 2000 is a update to the NBA In the Zone release last year (which we regret not reviewing for you fine IGNpocket folks).  The original NBA In the Zone was a hybrid Game Boy/Game Boy Color game (the black cartridge)  but this year, the game requires a Game Boy Color. With that in mind, you'd expect to see some changes in the way the game looks and play, but alas, the problems that plagued last year's edition are still here.  The graphics are still somewhat decent  the characters are big, the perspective is definitely appropriate for the type of game it is, and it's easy to follow the action. Every once in a while the character sprites will flicker for a splitsecond. An easy distraction, sure, but it's not that huge of a deal. And the sound is fine  you've got the ~Charge!~ music and other ambient tunes from the arena during a game, and the standard white noise crowd cheers.  The problem isn't cosmetic. No, it's all in the controls and AI. First of all, the computer artificial intelligence is downright horrible. Half the time the players will just stand there under the basket with the ball at their feet, and not a single one is intelligent to make the effort to go over and pick it up without your help. Heck, on a fast break, I've seen defensive players get out of the way simply because they weren't in the position they're designated. Totally bizarre, and totally wrong. What's worse is some of the controls  a jumpshot is as simple as holding the button down at the peak of your jump and letting go. A dunk, on the other hand, is an awkward thing  you have to pay attention to what your player is doing, and tap the button to time when the ball should actually go into the basket. The control scheme is an inconsistent design. These are the same exact problems that plagued the first game in the series on the Game Boy Color, and one must ask, what was done to make this better.  Okay, in its corner, Konami added a great mini-game: the Shootout. Here, you go up against a computer opponent or human player via the link cable, and shoot a total of 25 balls segmented into five positions around the three-point arc. Sink the most baskets in the set amount of time, and you win. The controls are configured so you have to time the shot perfectly, but it's one of those ~zone~ things  figure out the timing and you'll be on autopilot.   The game also features link-cable support, which is always a great thing to test out. In this case (and like last year's version), playing in link-up mode means you'll be playing in a slower version of the game. For some reason, the programmers couldn't make the game run at the normal speed transferring data back and forth  it's not surprising, there's a lot of information that needs to cut across the cable to the other system. But if another Konami game can keep five-on-five going at full speed, why couldn't this team? At least the Shootout mode doesn't suffer in two-player mode. I love Double Dribble. I don't love In the Zone. The game could have been a lot better if the developers just went with the classic formula. Instead, they strayed from the formula and didn't program the AI to act as aggressively as it should. I give the Shootout a thumbs up, but the overall game a thumbs down.", "date": "Apr 29, 2000"}
