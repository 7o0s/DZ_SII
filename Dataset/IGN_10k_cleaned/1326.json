I had been covering E3 on a PC-centric venue, and happened to stumble across Tecmo of America's booth. There, I spotted an arcade machine that bore much in common with my then-favorite game, Virtua Fighter 2 -- but the characters seemed edgier, the gameplay was more cutthroat, and all of the female fighters had absolutely enormous breasts that pulsated like plates of Jell-O. I was instantly hooked, and wound up importing the incomparable Saturn version later that year. As expected, I went nuts over the sequel as well, spending far too many yen in the arcade, and wasting too much time at home playing the North American DC version.  Unfortunately, Japanese Dreamcast owners have been getting the short end of the stick. While the American market got funky with Kasumi and friends on their US DCs, the Nippon was stuck with a jaggy-laden, four-month port on the PS2. Before the advent of the Gameshark and its lockout-busting features, Japanese game stores were actually selling DoA2/US Dreamcast combo packages for $350USD. But patience is a virtua, and dammit, Tokyoites have finally got their own rev of DoA2.  If you're reading this site, you probably already know that DoA2 is one rocking-ass fighting game, with the US version receiving a none-too-shabby 8.9. I'm not going to go into what makes the game so good -- you can read our original  review for the obligatory gushing -- but I'd rather focus on what sets this one apart from the domestic US version.  Tecmo has always liked to point out that Dead or Alive 2 is all about story. This is, of course, an out-and-out lie. DoA2 is all about kicking people through stained-glass windows, looking at girls' panties, and reveling in the concept of ~NEW COSTUME GET.~ The original working title for DoA was ~Sex and Violence,~ and it remains a more appropriate moniker to this very day.   Just as porno movies require some sort of hackneyed narrative to string everything together, DoA2 features visually stunning real-time cutscenes over the course of the game's ~Story Mode.~ Yet despite Tecmo's unparalleled artistic skills, their storytelling is roughly as nonsensical and disjointed as the late-night, medication-induced ramblings of my Great-Uncle Howard. Each of the characters have a particular bone to pick, or hold some ulterior motive for entering the fighting tournament: the crusty old  Gen-Fu fights for money so he can save his sick granddaughter; Helena seeks to uncover her mother's murderer; Leon needs to prove himself, as his mortally wounded lover told him that she truly loved the strongest man in the world. (Note to Leon: You weren't supposed to take it literally, you boob. Women say that stuff all the time.)  Yet there's very little in terms of storyline progression, resolution, or even conflict. Par example, Helena says to Ayane ~You... you killed my mother!~ ~Well, who knows?~ quips Ayane, and the fight breaks out. After defeating Ayane, we see a shot of Helena standing in a burning opera house, which transitions into the next fight. But wait! Why is the opera house burning? Was Ayane the murderess? What happened to her? What the hell's going on here?  And guess what -- all of the new cutscenes from the PS2 version are here, too, and they're every bit as goofy and incomprehensible as the rest of them. Watch in suspense as Tina throws a large rock at Lei Fang (who punches it), Hayabusa babbles on about the numerous evildoings at the tournament, and Jann-Lee punches out candle flames in a background that's not even in the game. The only noteworthy addition is the one where Zack talks with an arctic hare (~From now on, you will be my Tina-chan!~).  And the good lord knows that it wouldn't be a DoA game without extra crap to unlock. This was the biggest beef that critics had with the US version -- all of the stuff was unlocked from the very start, giving gamers no reason to pound through the game multiple times. But you'd better get ready to log some major time with this sucker if extra goodies are your thang -- this incarnation of DoA2 has mounds of extra costumes, two new characters, and other tantalizing tidbits to uncover.   New costumes seem to appear after using a character a certain number of times, though the internet crowd has been unable to figure out the precise details. After a day of hard-core playing, I had only uncovered one or two extra outfits for most of the players. I've also observed that the costume selection is kind of... odd. The original DoA played to every fetish in the book, with schoolgirl dresses, bunny-suits, and maid outfits. DoA2's wardrobe is much weirder, with the most notable additions being Lei-Fang's S&M outfit, and the 4P Tina costume, that's just  umm  I'll let the screenshots speak for themselves. On the plus side, some of the original outfits have been redone, and use subtle ~shader~ textures for an extra layer of shininess. Leon's 4P outfit is the coolest thing I have ever seen  he looks so reeeal...  You'll also be happy to learn that an old friend has returned -- Bayman from DoA is back in full effect, ready to snap some limbs and pop some shoulders with his Commando Sambo fighting. The final boss, Tengu, is also playable after a certain amount of time, allowing you to be a complete bastard to anyone who takes you on. There's also a reason to hop back into the two-on-two tag battle mode, as it's been heavily enhanced with new tag throws. Be on the lookout for new team-up attacks (that are frequently hilarious), and goofy win poses for each player combination.  Sadly, some of the additions in the PS2 version of DoA2 ain't here  the dojo, rooftop, and prairie levels are strangely absent. On the plus side, Dreamcast owners get two new multi-tiered combat zones from the original Model 2 DoA, including an amazing-looking castle and a darkly-lit temple. It's awesome stuff -- but we could have had so much more...  In your quest to unlock everything, you're going to be playing a lot of the single-player mode -- and that may not be a good thing. Blasting through Story Mode or Time Attack on the harder difficulty levels is an exercise in frustration, as DoA2 still sports some of the cheapest AI ever seen. Counter moves do way more damage than your average attack combo, and it's tricky to pull them off more than once or twice per round -- yet the computer has no problem reversing move after move after move, destroying you with reversals no human could pull off in rapid succession. ~It's thinking?~ My ass. It's cheating. Some characters are worse than others -- Kasumi and Ayane are the worst offenders, reversing you again and again with no opportunity for a hit to attack. Ah well  you'll get just as far in the unlocking quest playing your buddies in versus mode, which remains as enjoyable as always. And there's a new statistic-tracking VMU doo-hickey called the ~User Profile System,~ that keeps track of who you play as, and how many wins you've got.  And that about wraps up the list of improvements. The Japanese DoA2 is what the US version should have been  a fantastic arcade game that's been loaded up with extra goodies to make for a more rewarding home gameplay experience. Is it worth re-buying? Probably not  but if you've ignored (or rented) DoA2 in the past, chances are good that you'll get your money's worth from the import.     -- Colin ~Leon is My Hero~ Williamson, IGNDC", "date": "Oct 11, 2000"}
