{"name": "WipEout", "name_review": "Wipeout", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/27/wipeout", "text": "Most games that come out, regardless of platform, tend to follow fairly similar patterns. Perhaps developers feel they can get away with making the same game over and over again. Psygnosis has taken the high road with WipeOut, and while it's not totally and completely original, it does put a fairly large spin on the racing genre.  You pilot a futuristic hover-craft around incredibly detailed tracks, racing other hover-crafts towards ultimate glory. Along the way you pick up weapons to take out the other racers. The in-house techno music is excellent, and complements the game excellently. In fact, the whole game has a very special feel to it. It sucks you in through the presentation: the music, graphics, and Designer's Republic-designed logos all add to the immersive effects.  WipeOut does have its problems, though. The crafts are somewhat difficult to maneuver, and take some getting used to. Also, there aren't nearly enough competitors. Once you've learned how to ~fly~ the craft, you'll pull ahead of the other racers with no problem.  These are minor points, though. WipeOut is a good, solid game that pushes more boundaries than most. Ten years from now, when most other games have been long forgotten, WipeOut will be viewed as a classic.", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
