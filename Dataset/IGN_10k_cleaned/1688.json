{"name": "Steel Reign", "name_review": "Steel Reign", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/09/17/steel-reign", "text": "When that guy stole a tank from a Southern California armory and took it for a joy ride, he had everyone up in arms. The police couldn't do anything except follow at a safe distance because they didn't know if it was loaded or not. After destroying numerous cars and houses with its massive treads, the tank rammed into a freeway over pass, attempting to bring the concrete structure down. All he succeeded in doing was knocking the tank out of commission, leaving him prey to the cops who pried the lid open and shot him to death.  What does all this have to do with Steel Reign? Precious little aside from the fact that driving tanks around is cool, and everybody wants to do it.  Sort of like Warhawk with tanks, Steel Reign is primarily a mission-based action game. Choose from one of six high-speed, one man prototype tanks. Only three are available at the beginning, but the further the player gets in the game the more tanks will become available to him. Each is equipped with a variety of weapons, such as bullets, lasers, and missiles, with more available via power-ups.   The game is a heck of a lot of fun. Driving across deserts and through cities in a metal behemoth has never been so cool, and Steel Reign has wisely opted for a simple, arcade control scheme over a more complex sim one. The turret can be rotated independently of the tank, but that's about as complex as it gets. Even the targeting is done for you - all you have to do is choose your weapon and press fire.  That being said, the game isn't as easy as you'd think. The level of difficulty is right up there in the ~this sure is challenging~ area, with a ton of enemies descending upon you at every turn.  The graphics aren't the best the PlayStation has ever seen, and there are some occasional polygon glitches. But these aside, Steel Reign is an enjoyable, if basic, action title.", "date": "Sep 17, 1997"}
