Although it's called Universal Combat and published through a third party this time, this is still very much a BC game and Derek Smart's baby. The sheer size of the universe is daunting, the sheer number of planets, systems, space stations, and vessels staggering, and the level of management almost dizzying. While some may find the relative lack of guidance an opportunity for exploration and adventure, the place is just too big to take in one bite.  The issue of direction begins almost immediately, when you find yourself manning the bridge of a vessel floating in space. The interface features a host of unfamiliar acronyms nested in menus within menus. The control of the vessel is murky, and every button on the keyboard seems to do something to the ship. Yes, this is a simulation, but often it feels like a simulation of trying to figure out how to play Universal Combat. There are no tutorials in the game or in the manual. There are scant pop-up windows that explain what you're looking at. While it's understandable that a small development house like 3000AD has precious little resources to hold the player's hand through an introduction, it's also important to point out that the franchise has existed for almost seven years now, plenty enough time to jot down a few pointers on features that have remained essentially the same since BC's inception and slip it in the retail box.  The second thing that strikes you, especially during the planetary engagements, is the unsatisfyingly spare visuals. Textures are blurry, but the most important elements are the sheer space between landmarks and the lack of interesting terrain. It can take a long time to get to your target, and an even longer time to eliminate them, especially with aerial dogfights. The tedium of combat has a lot to do with sluggish controls. It takes a while to turn many of these planes around, and guns aren't nearly as useful as they are in space, since you can't slide and strafe. Before you fire any missiles, you have to ready them by clicking through the interface in mid-flight (or memorizing yet another hotkey combo). Then you'll cycle through the targets using the ~~ and ~>~ keys, on the other side of the keyboard from your directional controls. Even if you're using a mouse to fly, you still need to use the keyboard to tilt left and right. I find myself missing Freelancer, in which you put a target in the reticule and hit the ~M~ key, although that game is obviously on the other side of the flight combat design spectrum.    Missiles are easily dodged by both parties, and you have to get pretty close to be effective with the guns. Unfortunately, the enemies are mostly like ninjas, quickly darting in and out, staying out of range, and using a Wing Commander-style trick where one ship makes you chase after it while the other sneaks in behind you. I'm no flyboy, but I can sense that this is how a dogfight usually goes, since a single bullet can mean the difference between death and victory. But I would have liked a little recklessness to make things interesting.      There's more combat to cover, since it was emphasized a lot more with this installment. I'll get to the career mode a little further down. Planetary aerial combat was actually the most interesting aspect of UC, since the dangerous immediacy of the ground is ever-present, and vertical takeoff is pretty fun to do. In space, however, there's a lot of space. It takes a while to get in range of a target or destination, and sometimes your AI-controlled friendlies, if they're along for the ride, will make a tedious trip pointless by destroying the enemy vessel just before you get close enough. Space stations look close, like a mountain range seen from the highway, but they take a similarly long time to get to. And during the ride, your faced with the backdrop of the planet itself. While it is very impressive that the planets are true polygonal objects with scaled distances from other items, they aren't really so easy on the eyes, often painted with a single, basic texture devoid of lighting. So when the thing takes up your whole screen, the sense of distance, shape and orientation is eliminated.  And while I can appreciate that space is a vacuum, it is still a disappointingly quiet experience. I can't hear the inside of my ship, there isn't much radio chatter (during the space missions, at least), and the interface makes little noise. Locking onto a target, firing a missile, and watching it explode would be much more fun if I could hear some of the steps involved. And the explosions consist of rapidly expanding, transparent ovoids, rather than bursts of flame. There is flying debris, but you'll usually only see it when it's your own vessel being shot to pieces. The ambient music, while mostly good at first, quickly becomes repetitive, and feels out of step when it's majestically exciting in the midst of some mundane traveling from point A to point B.  Ground combat felt generally underdeveloped, since you could do things like walk through trees and buildings. Switching weapons took an age--but then, this is a simulation, so I guess it makes sense that I can't pull out my rifle like whipping out the nail clippers on a Swiss Army knife. Overall, fighting on the ground lacked the tangibility we've come to expect from a first-person shooter experience. Maybe we've been spoiled or dumbed down through years of relatively streamlined shooters, but the weapons don't feel dangerous, your character doesn't feel particularly agile, and the general flatness of terrain doesn't offer many tactical possibilities. Plus, the odd performance stutters that plague the game throughout are especially deadly when the twitch factor gets cranked up. Your time with UC is better spent in flight.    And you can spend all of it without putting a virtual foot outside your vessel. The varied career mode allows you to choose a race, then a class, then what ship you want to fly, and you can be a trader, miner, or just hop in a ship and explore. With a universe this size, you could play for weeks and never enter the same system twice. However, the ship population is extremely minimal, especially if you've become accustomed to the lively environments of other similar games like X2: The Threat or Freelancer. There isn't a variety of things to do as much as there's virtually countless places to do it in.  Multiplayer was problematic, since there were apparently no servers to be found, not even provided by DreamCatcher or 3000AD. This is surprising, since there is a community built around the franchise, and UC is under $20 brand-new. Even updating to the latest patch did not reveal anything, no matter what boxes or filters I clicked on. Even factoring in the possibility that I was logging in at odd times, multiplayer is isn't even trickling along.This game is like skyscraper built and maintained by a handful of peoplean impressive architectural achievement, given the small amount of resources and staff, but it's still a skyscraper. Meaning, there are details that one person or a small group can't polish or improve. There are things that will be overlooked, and things that will get dusty and stay dusty. And you'll have to cut a few corners in the bells and whistles department. Universal Combat does offer some interesting moments, especially when dogfighting in the cloudstumbling corkscrews, death-defying loops, missiles flying, warning alarms going off and all that. But content is not successfully determined by sheer size and interface depth, but by an environment that feels alive and, in the open-ended design, doing its own thing with its own routines. I would rather have explored a single, dynamic system or three, rather than piles of basically static ones that felt like they hadn't existed the moment before I arrived.", "date": "Mar 2, 2004"}
