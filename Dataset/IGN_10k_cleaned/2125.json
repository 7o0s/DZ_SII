{"name": "Portal Runner", "name_review": "Portal Runner", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/24/portal-runner", "text": "Set in the Army Men universe, Portal Runner tells the story of Vikki G. (she used to be referred to as Vikki Grimm, but, like the name Jennifer Lopez, it apparently wasn't hip enough), an ace reporter for the Green Army News, who has been trapped in a strange world by a henchman of Brigitte Bleu (I'll pass on the porn star reference), who has her sights on Vikki's hunky boyfriend, Sarge.   Gameplay With this as a backdrop, 3DO has been able to help breathe some new life into the Army Men franchise as the magical portals that lead to new worlds help give them a little more leeway with the settings in the game and they do a fine job of taking advantage of it. There are five total worlds and all that Vikki must make her way through and they range from a pre-historic dinosaur-filled universe to a futuristic one complete with Martians.   Early on, Vikki will meet up with Leonardo the Lion who will both aid Vikki in her adventures and help serve as a tool in helping keep the gameplay diverse. The basic gameplay consists of you either controlling Vikki alone, controlling Vikki and Leo in tandem or Vikki while riding Leo. Each provides some new control mechanics and helps keep the game feeling fresh.  Regardless of whether you're using Vikki, Leo or both, the game's premise is still pretty much the same, though. Portal Runner is a mix of platforming, puzzle solving, item collecting, and fighting -- which consists of either Vikki shooting enemies with a bow and arrow either in first or 3rd person view, or Leo clawing at an enemy.  When controlling Vikki, the player can order Leo to attack or not to attack and the more he attacks the more his Fury Meter will grow. As the meter increases Leo will do more damage and will be more aggressive, but he'll also be a little more out of control, so managing his Fury Meter is an added mechanic when playing the game.  Despite the nice mix of gameplay styles and play mechanics, Portal Runner still ends of feeling like a very simple game of trying to collect lots and lots of items. Most of the gameplay revolves around finding a key and collecting lots of jewels. Sure, the player is rewarded with bonuses for their completion percentage in each of the levels, but there's not really a feeling of purpose otherwise.  To make things worse, the game has shoddy control. It uses a control scheme similar to Resident Evil and Tomb Raider, where you press forward to move her forward, back to make her step back and left and right to rotate her body. This control scheme seems like it would make perfect sense, but it takes up old problems that are resolved in many of today's games. This scheme makes navigating her through the levels more painful than it should be.   Trying to do simple things such as turning around quickly or running over items aren't nearly as effortless as they ought to be. And since enemies will often pop out of nowhere to attack you from all angles, the combat can prove to be troubling since there's no way to quickly turn around and face an enemy. Furthering these problems, she rotates much too slowly. Sadly, the control helps kill an otherwise promising effort.  Graphics The Army Men series has never been known for its graphical achievement -- in fact, most of the games on the original PlayStation were marred by poor texture work, stiff animation and a horrible framerate. While Portal Runner won't make the Final Fantasy Xs, Metal Gear Solids and Devil May Cry's of the world worry, it will only serve to help the stature of the much-ridiculed franchise.  The most notable aspect of the game's visuals is that the framerate is pretty solid throughout. No more will fans have to put up with the choppy framerates that plagued pretty much all of the character-based games in the series on PlayStation. Likewise, the environments in the game are brightly colored and there are plenty of cool particle effects and other bits of eye candy that help make the game pleasant to look at.  Even still, nothing about the game's graphics will blow you away. And because the animation of Vikki, Leo, and the supporting characters and enemies are really stiff and limited, the game has the general look of what a PlayStation game would look like in high-resolution with some extra effects turned on. There was obviously some effort put into this game at some point, but it could've used a bit more.  Sound I've actually been of fan of the voiceovers used in the recent Army Men games and 3DO has once again done a fine job here in Portal Runner. The voices are generally a bit over-the-top and the lines are often on the cheesy side, but this is essentially a cartoon universe and the voices used and the way the lines are delivered work well in it.   The problem in this area is the general sound effects and background music. There's very little music used and what's used is far from memorable. And the ambient noises used in the background don't help set the mood as much as they simply get on your nerves because of their repetition. The Army Men franchise has been on the receiving end of plenty of mockery and laughter, and rightfully so, given that it's one of the most abused and generic franchises you'll find around. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that this series is the epitome of what's wrong with this entire industry in many ways. But, I digress. Portal Runner is likely the best non-Air Attack game that I've played in this widening franchise, and while it's still far from a game that I'd recommend, it's a step in the right direction. It just needed a little more time and probably a little bit more love.", "date": "Sep 24, 2001"}
