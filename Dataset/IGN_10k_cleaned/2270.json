The Factor 5 developed Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader represents the evolution of the LucasArts shooter franchise, which was sparked to life on Nintendo 64 some years ago. The GameCube sequel comes complete with all new levels based on scenes from the trilogy, the ability to pilot classic crafts as Jedi hero Luke Skywalker and more secrets than can easily be counted. And it's quite possibly the most beautiful title we've seen on any home console. Rejoice.

Like its predecessor, it is centered on the beloved Star Wars trilogy movies. It sports dogfight and search and destroy play mechanics that are similar in design to the N64 title. And the control schemes between the two are faintly recognizable, though some major changes and advancements have been introduced.  Players control characters Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles through a series of awe-inspiring missions -- 10 standard and more bonus -- ripped straight out of the classic franchise films. The title rockets the squadron immediately into the Attack on the Death Star scene from the original Star Wars. In it gamers must actually first pilot an X-Wing over the giant structure whilst shooting down enemy TIEs and then into the trenches for the explosive finale. It's here that one first becomes aware of the immensity Rogue Leader delivers. A vast, detailed plane of geometry stretches before players as they dodge laser fire and shoot down gun towers even while tens of TIEs soar here and there in an intense demonstration of system power. Just the sheer amount of activity is eye widening, and the visual presentation -- which we'll get to further into the review, is simply unequaled by any Star Wars game before it.  The beginning levels are easy, due in part to a control scheme that has been tweaked for the next-generation incarnation of the series. Players control the ships with the GameCube analog stick, and are able to freely fly in any direction -- up, down, left or right. It's possible to soar into a loop and continue onward, and the sensation is refined quite satisfactory over any previous Rogue offering. Flight control has overall seen significant improvements. The sway and reaction of ships is tighter and consequently more in tune with the movement of the crafts from the movies. One can, using the L trigger, easily turn a vehicle around and the digital-click of the R trigger functions first as a speed increase and then a full blown, wings-down boost depending on how hard it is pressed. It's a simplified scheme that works well and takes full advantage of the GameCube controller.  Indeed, a number of other ship functions have seen similar optimizations. For example, there is a certain strategic element to pressing the A button, which shoots lasers. Holding the button fires a continuous stream of low-powered beams and tapping it repeatedly offers stronger fire. But on top of everything else, skillful players out for gold medals can lay off the A button for a moment until a craft's guns have fully powered up, whereupon it can be pressed for linked lasers that inflict much more damage and can take out TIEs in one hit. Planning an attack using linked lasers isn't easy, but when enemy vehicles crash and burn after one well-placed shot -- well, it's a highly rewarding experience, we assure you.  The B button shoots torpedoes or ion cannons depending on the craft. Z-trigger sends ships into barrel rolls, which aren't good for much more than effect. X brings up the cockpit view, which is stunning, and from here players can use the camera stick to look around the insides of their ships. Y executes the target display system, which colors and clearly outlines enemies so that players can more easily identify them -- and it's not just a bogus extra; it works brilliantly and sometimes plays an integral role in the game. Finally, the D-Pad functions as a command center of sorts. Players can tell their squadron members to do everything from form up beside them to flee and attack TIEs. And this too is a highly intuitive and necessary addition.  Overall, ships handle fast and furious and the level of control is consistently tight and responsive. But that's not to suggest that uber-developer Factor 5 has attended to all of the original Rogue Squadron's shortcomings. Some issues remain. For example, the ships in the game don't often feel as if they have any deep physics to them. When one turns, it happens on a dime, without hesitation, and not always with an accurate sensation that a hulking, metal craft is soaring through space. Also, it's not uncommon to run into the occasional turn limit -- an angle or point where it's impossible to chase a TIE fighter to because the camera keeps trying to right itself. And the radar setup is often confusing. We realize that Rogue Leader isn't a simulation and therefore doesn't need abide by the rules of such efforts, but regardless, these oversights have a significant affect on the experience and therefore should be considered.  What Factor 5 has nailed without flaws are levels that are varied in mission goals, visual styles and level of intensity. Each scenario is overflowing with Star Wars character. The Attack on the Death Star, which we mentioned above, is somewhat of a dream come true for many fans as it perfectly re-creates the experience from the film. But there are of course many other areas to explore and battle through, each just as appealing. The Ison Corridor Ambush, a lavish scene that details the Rebel trip from the Death Star to Hoth, is a completely original locale that sees gamers flying both X-Wing an A-Wing against a legion of TIE fighters in a fight to protect a friendly convoy. The snowy Battle of Hoth enables gamers to hover speeders against a group of AT-STs before they destroy the Rebel base -- and it's a joy to play. Gamers can also fight against huge Star Destroyers in space, war over a beautiful ocean on Kothlis, sneak by Imperial forces under a thick fog, relive the Battle of Endor -- and much, much more! Each level becomes progressively more difficult so that by the Battle of Hoth, the missions are moderately hard to beat and near impossible to master and score gold medals on.   Of course, different levels call for different vehicles -- and Rogue Leader has them: A-Wing, B-Wing, X-Wing, Y-Wing, Millennium Falcon, Snow Speeder, Cloud Car, T-16, Darth Vader's Tie Advanced and others that are much more secret. Each craft has its own uniquely modeled cockpit and every single one looks simply breathtaking. But each also handles differently and features different functions too. For example, the Y-Wing is capable of bombing surfaces while the X-Wing can fire torpedoes. The speed and turn response for vehicles is also varied. It's a nice touch to be sure.  Rogue Leader is a short game. There -- we wrote it and you read it. By our estimation, the best players should be able to roll through it in five hours. More likely, though, it'll take many double that. Still -- it's not an epic undertaking to complete the standard 10 missions in the game. But the title is hardly over at just that. There are several secret missions to unlock, crafts to uncover, and special features (below) to seek out. These goodies can only be ascertained by the most dedicated -- the ones who go after the bronze, silver and gold medals in the game. And let us tell you now, that task is much more challenging and complicated. It's because of these extras and how they are acquired that we can wholeheartedly recommend both the gameplay experience and the replay value of the title as selling points.  The special features Rogue Leader offers are also very enticing indeed. In a trend that we hope continues, Factor 5 has treated the disc as if it was a movie-DVD and included some commendable extras for gamers to admire. First, it brandishes a behind-the-scenes documentary that details the making of shooter and also throws in enough footage for a good look at Factor 5's San Rafael based offices. Collectors and hardcore fans alike are sure to appreciate the bonus material. But beyond that, the title also boasts full audio commentary from key team members for all of the levels in the game -- which is just lovely. The title also features the original trailer for the project (when it was still dubbed a ~technical demo~) from Nintendo's Space World 2000 show. And if rumors are true, the Space World demo may even be a playable extra. We're not sure what's more impressive -- the extras themselves or that Factor 5 somehow created the game and all of the little goodies too in under a year. Graphics Rogue Leader has become Nintendo's flagship GameCube launch title because it has seemingly done what none of Nintendo's efforts so far have: crossed the visual barrier from old-generation to next. The game's graphics are stupendous, amazing, superb, and outstanding -- choose your favorite. The title represents the closest re-creation of the Star Wars universe that we have yet to see, and that's the truth.  So what's going on that makes it look so damn good? Quite a lot as it turns out. First, the art style of the game, though admittedly based on the movies themselves, is beautiful. And the unsleeping tech-robots at Factor 5 have gone the extra mile to push GameCube commendably. Rogue Leader runs at 60 frames in some levels and at 60 / 30 in others. Every level in the game is a gigantic, untamed thing that stretches forever and is drowned in geometry. Polygons are pushed well into the millions to form some of the most detailed ship and character models, and everything is exquisitely lit and shadowed by the artists. But there are also crazy real-time lighting effects, casting shadows and self-shadowing objects. And every texture seems to be bump-mapped, or dirt-mapped, or reflection-mapped -- or whatever.   Ison Corridor -- looks pretty amazing, huh?  And we could keep going. There are the little extras. Shimmering heat waves in the deserts of Tatooine. Flame blur on the backs of ships. Volumetric fogging for the clouds of Bespin and the Ison Corridor. Advanced polygonal and particle explosions and spark effects. A cel-shaded target display. Even a slick menu interface that seamlessly blends in FMV cut-scenes from the movie with no slow-down. Everything looks splendid.  But none of these tech feats mean anything to the end player. What matters is that all of these effects come together to quite realistically mimic the real thing -- and that's an accomplishment that is close to monstrous. Plus -- and this shouldn't be overlooked, the game runs in progressive scan mode for players with televisions that support it. We highly suggest running everything this way if possible as it cleans up the screen noticeably. Audio It's Factor 5. We could probably end the audio portion of the review right there, but we'll go on for those that still don't understand. Rogue Leader sounds like Star Wars. Perfectly. The game uses a combination of orchestrated music and interactive MIDI renditions for an overall listening experience that is undeniably outstanding. The orchestrated tunes are of course brilliant and Factor 5's MIDI contributions usually blend seamlessly into the mix (with the occasional out of place horn). The dynamic music is a welcomed addition as it reacts perfectly to situations in the game. For example, during the trench run, the music intensifies as Luke prepares to fire a torpedo into the unprotected hole of the structure.  The title is brought to life in part by some great samples from the movies and original voice acting by LucasArts' reserves. It sounds great -- just like the movies. And when gamers hear Darth Vader call out ~the Force is strong with this one~ during a hectic battle, they are sure to smile. Plus, thankfully the supplied extra voice acting sounds just like the characters from the trilogy and is actually not exaggerated or poorly executed.  Bringing all of this together into one neat little package, Rogue Leader runs in Dolby Pro Logic II for 5.1 surround sound -- despite the fact that GameCube has no digital out. A matrix developed by Jim Fosgate takes GameCube's analog signal and filters it appropriately. The result is a simulated, but nonetheless effective 5.1 listening experience complete with clear separation in the front and rear speakers, not to mention sub-woofer output. Trust us on this -- it sounds amazing. The only problem is that gamers will need to buy a Dolby Pro Logic II capable receiver to take full advantage of the technology.You may also like our top 10 list: Best Star Wars GamesFor 20 years, gamers have wanted to fly Luke Skywalker's X-Wing through the trenches of the Death Star and now -- finally, it's possible. Factor 5's Rogue Leader is the natural evolution of the Rogue Squadron franchise, which is a good thing. It proudly boasts ironed out controls, more intuitive level missions and goals, more variety in missions and some amazing extras -- new cockpit views to DVD-like bonus material -- to boot. It's not a perfect game. There are a few issues with a still unpolished camera scheme and unrefined ship physics. But in the end the play experience is damn near great, if a little short. And if the title's play mechanics don't grab players immediately, its unbelievable graphics surely will. Huge levels, tons of intricately detailed high-polygon ship models and landscapes, real-time lighting effects, volumetric fogging, self-shadowing objects -- all with a fluidity that runs in some levels at 60 frames and in others at 60 and 30 frames.
