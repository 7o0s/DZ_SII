You point, click, progress through what's hopefully an engaging story. Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle does all of those things with an occasionally decent sense of humor and a cool cartoony art style. The puzzles, also a mainstay of point and click adventuring, run the gambit from logical to lame. The grand result is a game that has a healthy helping of frustration with a light frosting of fun on top.   One of the most important aspects of an adventure game is the story. Because there's no action to draw players along through an otherwise slow environment, the dangling fictional carrot has to be pretty tantalizing. The premise of Runaway: DotT is ridiculous enough that you actually do end up wondering where everything is going even if it takes a while to really get into groove. The story follows Brian Bosco and his girlfriend Gina (both holdovers from the first Runaway game) as they run into trouble after going to take a tour of the fictional Mala island on their Hawaiian vacation. Brian quickly finds himself stranded on the island while Gina is shot and at the bottom of a lagoon. From there, Brian meets with all sorts of crazy characters including more that fans of the original will recognize.    When the real challenge and mystery is identified, you're halfway through the game and still a little confused. The main crux of the story is presented so nonchalantly that it's like the characters are talking about what they had for dinner when in reality any sane person would wig out a little. Yes, it's a cartoon, but incredulous reactions to crazy things work in cartoon-land also and can lend to some quality humor. That said, the developers at least realize some of the ridiculous nature of adventure games, such as when the main character comments on the size of his pockets to hold such gigantic items like chainsaws and hockey sticks.   Part of the problem with the story probably stems from the anemic voice-work. The main character Brian Bosco doesn't seem phased by the fact that he's been nearly killed by several different things nor that life beyond Earth exists. He just moseys on, as mellow as can be, while his loving girlfriend is missing. Nothing later on in the game experience seems to make much of an impression either. Of course, Brian is a total doofus, which is part of his character, but he's just not very likeable. While Brian's voice work occasionally has more personality as the game goes along, the rest of the cast is a big hit and miss. Characters like psychopathic smartipants Archbald are fun to listen to, but Brian's friend Sushi is boring as all hell and both Joshua and Rutger (obviously voiced by the same guy) are like nails on a chalkboard.    All that said, the game does have some good cutscenes. Not all of them are paced appropriately but others have a ton of animated personality and fun. The brightly colored cartoony art style really lends to the adventure well. Environments are detailed and great to see. The major problem is that the developers didn't make it easy enough to find certain objects in the environment. One of the very first puzzles requires an object to be found in the middle of quicksand and it's near impossible to see. You'll need a lucky pass with the mouse to see the cursor change to know that anything is there. Unfortunately, the desire to make the interactive objects not stick out so boldly also makes them blend into the environment pretty easily.    Puzzles work along the same lines of other adventure games you've played in the past. They vary from some clever and logical puzzles like using a hose to siphon gas from a car to slightly more illogical ideas like welding a key back together using a magnifying glass and a ray of sun. The biggest problem is that the game requires players to choose the wrong solution to find the correct one at times instead of giving rewards for smart thinking.   Let's take one of the middle puzzles as an example. Brian, at one point, is supposed to go fishing for a salmon. Without going into too much detail about the way it's done, he needs to use a hockey stick and a fake bear paw to do it. I made the mistake of figuring that out right away and tried to combine the two objects together to make a fishing device. Poor Brian says ~I can't see any reason to do that,~ which of course, confused the crap out of me since the paw didn't work by itself and everyone had been talking about how bears catch salmon. After wandering around looking for other devices I became frustrated, walked back to the hole and decided to try every object. The hockey stick allowed me to try and fish but wasn't successful. Seeing that I at least was able to try the hockey stick out, I once again, with hope in my heart, tried to use the bear paw with the hockey stick. It worked. Why the game wouldn't allow me to use the ~logical~ solution immediately is beyond me. I probably should have figured it out given that the game had basically required me to use the wrong solution before being able to use the correct one at other times before this, but that's just stupid design to an otherwise decent puzzle.   That said, it is nice to see an adventure game maker trying to do something other than the realistic point and click adventure slide shows that seem to be so prevalent these days. Runaway: The Dream of the Turtle reminds me of the days when LucasArts had mastered the art of point and click adventuring with games like Maniac Mansion, Sam & Max, and Grim Fandango where crazy stories could happen outside of real-world influence. Runaway doesn't get everything right, in fact, there are some very frustrating aspects to the gameplay, but the story is wacky enough and art style fun enough that adventure gamers may way to give this one a shot.", "date": "Apr 11, 2007"}
