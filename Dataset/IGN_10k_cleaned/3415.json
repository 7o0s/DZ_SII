{"name": "Galerians: Ash", "name_review": "Galerians: Ash", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/02/04/galerians-ash", "text": ", sequel to the PS1 game Galerians, takes place almost right after the events found in the first game. The story is a poor mishmash of sci-fi  clichs that draws much of its inspiration from the likes of such seminal works as  Akira and The Matrix. You've got your self-aware computer that revolts against mankind; you've got humanoids with psychic abilities; and who could forget the inner struggle of discovering where true reality lies. For those not in the know, the first Galerians had you in the role of Rion, a young man out to stop the sentient computer known as Dorothy from destroying the human race. In the end you were victorious, but now, six years later, Dorothy is back and so are you. If this makes little sense to you, don't worry: the game summarizes the events of the previous game in a somewhat lengthy intro movie.As a game, Galerians: Ash had a lot of potential. Even with its hackneyed storyline, the thought of using psychic powers in all-out Akira-like battles is still irresistible. It's just too bad that Ash couldn't deliver on this concept in any way or form.GameplayThere are several glaring design issues in Galerians: Ash that keep it from being an enjoyable gaming experience in any sort of way. Let's start with the combat system. Rather than having a weapon at your disposal, your character has three psychic abilities that he can use to battle enemies and bosses: Nalcon, Red, and D-Felon. To use any one of these powers you must first charge it up, which takes roughly a second or two. Herein lies the problem. While charging up your attack, you can neither move nor use your shield, and are completely susceptible to attack. Most of the time you will take damage before you fully charge your blast and must start your charge all over again...only to get hit again...only to have to charge again... Catch my drift?This combat system makes no logical sense. You can lock onto enemies and strafe around them while not attacking, but God forbid you be allowed to dodge attacks while trying to attack yourself. And using your shield isn't any better since that also makes you immobile, and you can't charge an attack while using it. The shield is also worthless when fighting a bevy of enemies because it only shields your front side, leaving your sides and back open for devouring. Now imagine facing three enemies that move just as quickly as you do while trying to block their attacks with your shield, all the while attempting to find a free moment to charge your attack. And remember: you can't move while on the offense or defense. Whatever.  Another overt gameplay problem is the mixture of puzzles with battle. For example, one of the first puzzles you'll come across has a flame in the center of the room. When you run through it, it disappears and re-appears in a different location. The goal is to keep running through the flame until the door opens. If you wait too long before running through the next flame, it will disappear and you must start over. Not really a difficult puzzle to figure out on its own, picture a group of enemies chasing you while trying to complete the task. Attacking or defending will force you to stop moving thereby wasting the limited amount of time you have to make it to the next flame. My first thought was to kill all the enemies first, then proceed with the puzzle, but the enemies re-spawn after you kill them. So, your only real choice is to run away and avoid battle completely while trying to complete the puzzle. Sound design? I think not.As is the case in most 3D games, camera issues also creep their way into the game. The game is played from a third-person behind-the-back perspective and the only control you have over the camera is its height. All three of these camera angles are so similar I wonder why the option was even included. Most of the time the default camera is usable, but there are just too many occasions where its spin causes confusion, especially when locked onto enemies. There is also a first-person mode that you can use, but not only is this a worthless feature, its implementation feels sloppy. Let me explain: there are rarely times when you need to switch to a first person mode for any reason. Only in the occasional boss fight does this come in handy, and even then it's a minor accommodation. Then there's the sloppy implementation. To use the first-person view you just press the right analog stick in the direction you want to look. This causes the camera to jerk so suddenly into a first-person perspective that you almost have to reorient yourself before examining the area. Full control of the camera, as well as a simple ~hold the trigger~ system for first-person viewing would have been a much, much better solution.But Galerians: Ash's worst problem is not the clunky battle system, or its faulty puzzle design, or its unmanageable camera; it's the boring gameplay. More often than not, you'll be traversing large, capacious rooms and hallways that are lifeless and non-interactive without any real clue as to what you're supposed to be doing. Only by searching every room and going through every floor will you eventually find what you're looking for, and that's by accident. Then, after you find an item of interest, you'll have to search the same five floors of rooms again in hopes of accidentally running into another item or person that may trigger a cutscene or give you a clue as to your next objective. And the whole time this is going on, there's nothing to keep your interest visually, mentally, or sonically; boring indeed.     GraphicsGalerians: Ash has a lot going for it visually, but equally as much going against it. First, the good: as advertised on the back of the box, there are ~real time battles in 60FPS.~  Actually, the whole game runs at a rock-solid sixty frames per second, even during boss battles that have more particles polluting the air than in downtown Los Angeles. Some of the environments are also intimidating in their vast openness and Gigerian art direction, not too mention being fancifully adorned with sharp, detailed textures. Overall, a good, solid graphics engine powers the visuals behind Galerians: Ash. But where the visuals falter is in their art direction (I know, a contradiction from above, but let me explain) and animation. While some of the environments do look great (see above), most of them are of the metal hallway variety: generic looking rooms and corridors that have little in the way of visual landmarks and/or decorative style. Too bad. Also, the character models and animation leave a lot to be desired. Take the main character for example. His rockstar-skinny body and bowed arms that waddle while he runs make him a little hard to take seriously as a psychic badass, if you know what I mean. Many of the other characters suffer some similar design issues too, as well as overly simplified models that look almost a generation too old.A caption on the back of the box says, ~Featuring over 60 minutes of High Quality cutscenes,~ and this is no lie. The cutscenes found in the game are generally very sharp, but some of them seem to be in-game cutscenes that have been compressed and thrown in as video. The video artifacts and drop in quality make these scenes stick out like opposable thumbs on a feline. The lip syncing is also off a majority of the time in both the in-game and CG cutscenes, and radiates a feeling of cheapness from the game.  SoundMany of the game's cinemas are fully voiced, and the result will leave you begging for a little more supper on your plate. Definitely not the worse you'll ever hear, the voice acting is missing the one crucial element that makes voices the storytellers they are: real human emotion (but maybe that's fitting considering Rion is in fact not real). The lines are delivered with an emptiness and contrivance that make Steven Wright seem more like Robin Williams in comparison. The fact that many of the lines are so poorly translated and/or written doesn't help. Take the battle with Parano for example. After defeating him he says, ~Next time definitely I'm going to screw up your brains for sure.~ Um, sure, you go ahead and do that...definitely...for sure...yeah.Not taking the voice acting into consideration, the game music is pretty sparse, but what's there is decent. A lot of ambient bass and metallic sounds fill the air, with your occasional electronic music filling in the blanks. Strictly average stuff.Galerians: Ash could be categorized as a survival horror, or an action adventure, or even a light RPG. Call it what you want, but I'd call it dull. There are just too many problems and too little to do in the game to make it worth anyone's time. If you were a big, and I mean big fan of the original, trying renting Galerians: Ash. Everyone else, avoid at all costs.", "date": "Feb 4, 2003"}
