Sure, you get some ~gems~ such as Blasto, Animorphs, Bubsy 3D, and Batman Beyond, but when a game arrives that is based on Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas you kind of expect more from it. Or at least some. Maybe just a little.   The Grinch puts you into the role of the title character, and follows the basic storyline of the classic book and recent movie, but just as the movie deviates from the original story  this game deviates from the movie as well. So you have a movie that adds stuff on top of a classic story, then you have a game based on that movie that goes even farther in adding stuff. You start off in the Grinch's cave, and then continue on to WhoVille, WhoForest, WhoLake, and the Dumps. The problem is, you'll probably loose interest in the game before you get to the end, and the reasons are numerous.   Gameplay Everyone's favorite green scrooge hates Christmas, and the happy little Whos love Christmas. So, the Grinch must do everything in his power to ruin the holiday for the Whos, which is where the actual gameplay comes in.  The Grinch tries very hard to be an adventure game, but it ends up reminding one a little of an old Genesis game called Haunting: Starring Polterguy. In that game you played a ghost that had to scare a family out of a house by performing tricks and planting objects to frighten them. The Grinch's gameplay consists of the green antihero running around and causing unhappiness by doing pranks and the like.  Each level has a certain number of missions that the Grinch must complete in order to make the little Whos cry. Some of these are done by interacting with background objects (such as stomping on snowmen or tossing beehives into houses) or by using a Grinch gadget that must first by constructed by finding blueprints hidden throughout each of the worlds.  The problem with the mission structure in the game is that there is usually little, or no, clue whatsoever to what you need to do. Missions are listed in a book that you can access within the pause menu, but some can be very vague and you can wander around for hours before you finally figure out what exactly you have to do. Some of them are easy to figure out (such as stomping or destroying a certain object), while others are a real pain.  This would be all right if the game wasn't targeted toward children since a kid's game is usually supposed to be pretty easy. But this game is actually extremely confusing and at times very hard.  Control is pretty standard with only a couple minor problems. One such problem is aiming in the first person view, which can be touchy at times. Also, you can take control of the Grinch's trusty pup, Max, by pressing the SELECT button. At times this is needed to reach a part of the level where the Grinch is too big to fit.   Graphics As with many other PlayStation games that aim for an animated look, the majority of the graphics in The Grinch have a very flat-shaded look with very minimal textures. That would be OK if the draw distance wasn't so close and the game actually had a framerate when there is more than one polygonal character on the screen.   First, the draw distance. If you ever played Vigilante 8 or its sequel, the game would probably look familiar to you. There are only textures about five feet in front of your character, and everything else from there on is a flat texture-less polygon. That is ok in a fast-paced car combat game such as V8, but in an ~adventure~ game such as this, it actually hurts the gameplay. There are times when you need to see something on a wall  except the wall is just a flat polygon since you are not close enough for the texture to be displayed.  If this game was Floating Runner 2, then maybe it would be OK, but it's the Grinch and PlayStation owners in the year 2000 expect consistent textures.  Next up, the framerate. Everything is fine and good when the Grinch is the only character on the screen, but as soon as another polygonal character appears the game switches into slow motion mode. Let's see...bad draw distance + bad framerate = bad graphics. And the Grinch, which is a simplistic game that's based on a cartoon-style animation that requires minimal textures, can't handle the basics without these problems. I guess if you're five you may not turn the other cheek to this game, but the odds aren't in the Grinch's favor.   Sound Surprisingly, this is one of the few parts of the game that is actually bearble. The Grinch's voice is a good imitation of Jim Carrey's take on the character, and the music is actually pretty good. It's not flooded with Christmas tunes as one would probably expect, but the music is not from the movie either, so don't get your hopes up.  The only thing that is a little weird about the sound is the narrator. He sounds a lot like the narrator from Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, which is extremely strange to hear in a game that is naturally targeted to the kiddies. I have always been a huge fan of the original animated version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Chuck Jones is an animation god (OK, I exaggerate a tiny winy bit), and it had Boris Karloff (Frankenstien and the Mummy among others) as the narrator as well as The Grinch. Unfortunately just as the live action movie couldn't hold a candle to that legacy, neither can the videogame. The game just feels unfinished. If there was a little more direction in the missions, and the graphics were a little smoother, and the levels had some consistency in the level of difficulty, it may have been decent. As it stands right now, the game is painfully average.", "date": "Dec 7, 2000"}
