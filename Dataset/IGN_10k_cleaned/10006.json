The good news is that we still very much enjoy the aspects of the game that initially appealed to us and we've discovered even more sophisticated gameplay lurking beneath the surface. The bad news is that the game fails to do a good job orienting players towards the more rewarding content. In short, there's plenty of treasure here, but you have to bring your own shovel.  As we've said before, the world of pirates provides a perfect setting for any MMO. It provides a ready conflict between authorities and criminals, national rivalry, a rich variety of trade and technology, dramatic swordfights, customizable ships of war, and an attitude that simply can't be beat. For the most part, Pirates of the Burning Sea captures all of these elements perfectly. And rather than going for the cheap, Hollywood version with cursed treasure and sass-mouthed parrots, this version is refreshingly realistic in terms of subject matter.   We have to admit that we weren't big fans at first. The game simply seemed to offer a fairly standard MMO approach with hot bars, xp grinds, and the usual assortment of lethargic NPCs who are only interested in seeing if you'll run a few errands for them. But after playing for a week or so, the game began to reveal a rich ship combat system that relied more on the player than their character. Further play opened up a sophisticated economy that is not only driven by the players, but also acts as an incentive to participate in a rewarding PVP game that's not strictly geared towards veteran players.  The real problem though is that the game does an absolutely terrible job of directing players towards this content and then helping them to put it into an appropriate context. Sure, we like to discover things for ourselves from time to time, but there's a real lack of explanation here once you get beyond the most basic game features. What makes that particularly disappointing is that some players may give up on the game before they discover just how original and enjoyable it can be.  Luckily, one of the most approachable aspects of the game is also the most enjoyable. Ship combat is the most obvious selling point of this game, and the rich tactics and maneuvers possible are worlds away from the traditional hot bar macros of so many other MMOs. Sure, there are cool down timers for certain skills, but battles play out in real time here and are more a function of your smart seamanship than you character level. I won't say that the passive RPG skills you can obtain as you rise in level aren't important, but the emphasis here is on being smart.   Things like wind direction and point-of-sailing have to be taken into consideration. Ship facing also matters when it comes to gunnery. You can chew through ships much easier when you're firing into their stern or their bow and since multi-ship engagements are the order of the day, you'll definitely need to keep an eye on your own hull condition as well. Tons of items, both made by players and dropped by enemy NPCs, can be attached to your ship to increase its effectiveness in a number of areas -- from turning acceleration, to cannon range to battle speed. With so many variables, no two ship battles ever really play out the same, and after nearly a month we're still enjoying them.  The controls for ship combat are well designed and you'll never feel like you're fighting the interface just to get the right shot loaded or the right target selected. We might have enjoyed seeing our ship speed represented in a graphical fashion, rather than just being a number tucked down in the lower corner, where a single glance is enough to jar you out of the action for a second. And though it might be an interface nightmare, we still can't shake the desire to watch the battles from our character's perspective on the deck of our ships.      Unfortunately, when you grapple enemies and engage in boarding actions, things completely fall apart. The dueling design is mediocre at best and seems even less inspired when it follows such an intense and rewarding ship battle. Here we're back in the world of hot bar combat where the only things worth watching are your cool-down timers and your enemy's health. There's a bit of sophistication built into the concepts of balance and initiative bars and, god help us, we've finally started to figure out how to chain our attacks correctly, but for the most part, sword fights just drain our interest. It's true that there are some larger land missions where you'll have to say, assault a heavily defended fort or pirate cave, but even here the only real tactical challenge is in drawing small groups of enemies away so you don't get overwhelmed.  Even if the sword fights are lame, at least the missions seem genuinely important. There's none of this, ~Go give this note to my brother at the other end of the room~ crap here. (Well, there is a little of that, but not much.) Most of the missions here sound like they're genuinely important enough to justify someone actually asking for your help. Whether you're drowning poodles, protecting merchants or seeking translators for a treasure map, everything here fits with the style of the game and strengthens the overall atmosphere. The text descriptions can be a little dry, of course, and the NPCs are a little passive but since there seems to be so much personality within the actual missions, it's hard to complain.   It's a shame though that the missions aren't sorted by location like they are in pretty much every other MMO on the market. Having to click through the description of each mission to see where you should go next is a bit of a pain, but at least you can pull up the town or sea map and see points of interest where you have a specific objective. In town, of course, mission givers are noted by large green exclamation points and question marks to indicate that they can start or end a mission.  We haven't seen all of the towns, not by any stretch of the imagination, but we have seen little backwaters and national capitals and a range of places in between. The towns here are well designed in terms of visuals, and take full advantage of the iconic images you'd expect from the setting. Every time you round a corner you never know what to expect. You might find soldiers chatting with lusty wenches, sailors dicing in the alleys, or pirates hanging in large iron cages. While the visuals are great, it would really add to the life of these towns if people actually moved around.  Most towns are laid out fairly well and offer all the services you'll need, from an auction house to ship and sword trainers to officers who can reward you for loyal service. There are also pubs and mansions and trade offices where you can meet NPCs for further quests. The experience is a bit different depending on whether or not you're sailing in the service of a country or have taken up the life of a pirate, but your basic needs are going to be the same.   If you're so inclined, you can also set up your own warehouses and factories in these towns. The factories can take advantage of raw materials (which differ from port to port) to create tradable goods. Since there's such a wide range of goods and so many are required to actually produce a finished product, it really encourages players to rely on each other to fill in the gaps. Even just deciding to start trading rum requires a lot of moving parts, so actually creating a real warship is a pretty colossal investment that's better when spread among multiple crafters.  But there are a couple of flies in the ointment here. To begin with, the basic interface for all this is pretty unattractive and a bit clumsy. It definitely puts lots of information and access right in front of you, but the overall appearance is just inelegant. The second issue is the whole concept of selling goods isn't ever really explained. I mean, it's easy enough to know that you have to drop your stuff off at an auction house, but the game never really explains the significance of the distinct economic areas that auction houses are part of or the ways in which your asking price, the buyer's offer and the average price the item is selling for relate to one another. We've seen items for sale for a specific price, well below the average price, and not even been able to buy it for three or four times what the seller is asking for. To me, that's just confusing.      The tax on foreign goods and the scarcity of certain raw materials in the Caribbean will eventually encourage players to capture other ports to open up new goods for trade. This is sort of the driving force behind the game and one in which players of nearly all levels can take part. Unlike other RVR experiences in the MMO world, this one offers valuable roles to new and old players alike. The low level players can help to increase or decrease the stability of a port by running missions around it or by contributing to its economy.  If a port is sufficiently destabilized, pirate players can swoop in and start terrorizing the shipping and claiming prizes. When things get really bad, players in the service of one of the three nations in the game can actually stage 24v24 PVP battles to determine ownership of the port. Whoever wins gains access to the new resources and has to work to establish order once again. The extent to which a port is ripe for capture is indicated on the main map, so players can know when and where to further the cause of their countrymen.    Again, it's a very interesting idea, but one that just isn't made as clear as it could be.  Visually Pirates of the Burning Sea offers some stunning views. Whether you're walking the narrow streets of a bustling Caribbean town, standing beneath the towering wreckage of a beached warship, or chasing down enemy traders in a lagoon at sunset, there's always a strong sense of place established by loads of small details and smart choices of lighting and color. Whether it's piles of gold on a merchant's desk, sacks of flour on the docks, or a rich oriental carpet in the magistrate's office, there's a real attention to detail in each and every area in town that makes them feel like real places. The character models aren't very expressive but there's such a variety of dress here, that you almost don't notice that no one has any expression on their face.  The sea battles are stunning. It's true that the water tiles quite a bit under the right light, but the wave action, land formations, lighting and different atmospheric effects provide a realistic backdrop for the ship to ship combat. The ships themselves are wonderfully animated, with little guys climbing up in the rigging and crews racing to load and fire your guns. What's especially nice is that you can actually watch all these details while also maintaining your effectiveness in battle. The only thing we'd really wish for here is a clearer sense of hull damage on the ship models.  The interface itself is pretty dated, unfortunately, and could stand to be tidied up a bit. The iconography is just old-fashioned, which might be intentional given the subject matter, but in any case, is still a bit distracting. We played in a lower resolution than we would have liked, simply because it was too hard to read the text at higher resolutions.    We really like the audio design in this game. The ambient noises, both when you're at sea and in port, just do so much to bring the game world to life. The subtle sounds of life in the towns are particularly convincing, but we don't want to discount the sound of seals barking near the rocky shores during your water encounters. The sounds of battle are just as engaging. The weight of cannon shot as they boom out of your guns and tear into the enemy hulls is very convincing, particularly if you've got a good subwoofer. The music is also very evocative and fits the mood of the game perfectly.Pirates of the Burning Sea is the perfect antidote to the proliferation of traditional MMOs. If you've already grown sick of elves and hot bars, Pirates will definitely offer up something you haven't quite seen before. It's highly original and it takes a lot of chances that pay off handsomely. The real time ship combat is awesome in its tactical complexity and the player economy is deeper than we've seen in just about any other game. Unfortunately, the sword combat feels tacked-on and really cramps our swashbuckling groove.With all that said, Pirates is one of those games that is likely to discourage gamers early on. And that's a real shame, because it's precisely the type of game that gets better the more you play it. Those who are discouraged by the lack of orientation won't ever really pass through into the enjoyment of the game's richly detailed and dynamic mechanics. In short, you're only going to get out of this one what you're willing to put into it, but it's well worth it if you can stick it out through that first confusing week or two.", "date": "Feb 12, 2008"}
