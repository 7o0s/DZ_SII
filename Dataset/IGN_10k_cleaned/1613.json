Not that I don't appreciate ESPN's premier spectator stunt sport coverage, which has taken the fearless hardcore showmanship of BMX, skateboarding, and street luge back to the forefront of athleticism after peaking in the early '80s. No ~Xtreme!!!~ sports, no Tony Hawk games, and I would never want to imagine a world like that again.  But sometimes, when playing some of these cornball extreme sports videogame knock-offs, I wish it would all go back to simpler days of baseballs and hockey pucks. When the Berenstain Bears, America's most pleasantly pacifist simpleton picnickers, try to get down with 'dat wicked air, you know it's gone too far. Watching Sister Bear spin 720 while riding fakie on a skateboard on hard pack gives me the feeling that something is very, very wrong.    Features:  6 styles of top-down stunt racing Pull off dozens of tricks in each mode, including hidden stunts Get air with Brother of Sister Bear Only for Game Boy Color   As absurd as it seems, the Berenstain Bears throw down some of their own stylie for an extreme sporting contest held locally. Bro and Sis Bear go gonzo on bikes, dirt boards, luge sleds, and extreme rafting kayaks. And aww yeah -- you didn't think Momz and Pops Bear could miss out on this mad aerial action did you? Nutin' could keep this psycho-grinder family off their wicked toboggin or phat river raft.  Nothing but the truckload of rocks, logs, and obstacles in every track of this game. Developed for children (I assume -- although even then, the Berenstain Bears aren't exactly the pinnacle of coolness with the toddler jet set), Extreme Sports with the Berenstain Bears is absurdly hard. Every corner has some kind of enormous block to stumble over, and even when you hit a jump nicely, there's still a good chance to get caught up in the curving walls or land face-first on a tree stump. And if a gamer goes for the gusto and takes to the track hell-bent on winning, the times to beat to get on the Leader's board to land up on the podium are insanely competitive. Even my best times with the game set on Easy were just splits of seconds ahead of the second-place racer. On Black Diamond courses, expect to get pounded, gashed, rashed, and planted, then humiliated by all the other competitors.  With the difficulty taken down a smidge -- a big smidge -- the game might have been silly fun. While turns are tough to take until players get used to the top-down controls, it's appropriately fast for the gameplay, and has lots of stunts to pull off, including all kinds that are hidden and require control taps. Players will have to time tricks right for the ramp and their speed -- there's no way to land a 720 unless you're booking and get massive height. But the reward is a stop of the clock, which will shave time off the difficult tracks and get closer to a medal.  Graphics are nice and pleasant, if not overly expressive, but then again, who was expecting a Berenstain Bears extreme sports game to blow them away? Each of the tracks is individually drawn for the purpose, so even tracks that might repeat themselves, like the Skateboarding and Biking events, have different backgrounds. Also, the animation is smooth and clean, with full rotation animations to make turning less a chore than it is in other top-down racers. Unfortunately, the tricks do not animate to the direction, so doing a Eskimo Roll in a kayak will typically steer you right into a wall. There's also not much of a drain on the audio either, since no music is used in the courses, but at least the developer went for a cleaner approach with just simple sound effects instead of bad MIDI.     I just knew from the moment I switched this game on and saw a long, long, long animation of the Berenstain Bears family driving slowly along the countryside in the family car that this extreme game wasn't going to live up to its name. Oh, sure -- I also knew that some time before that as well, but I was hoping it might at least be silly fun.And it almost was. There unfortunately is no link play, tricks and stunts aren't great bliss (you can only do a stunt off a ramp, so it's generally just a top-down racing game and little more), and over it has an unfinished feel of the modes (there's not even a loser finishing screen at the end of a circuit, and when you do place, the great big winning celebration is a still of your bear holding a trophy. Then, game over.) Still, the expectations are so low for a Berenstain Bears extreme sports game that almost anything might be a surprise, and the game does have an enjoyable racing engine going here. They just tweaked this mutha' out to the max in terms of difficulty, so whatever simple pleasures it has to offer are lost in the tracks. Brother Bear got a raw deal.", "date": "Dec 8, 2000"}
