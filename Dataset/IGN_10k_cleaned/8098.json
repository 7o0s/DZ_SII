I remember when my parents bought me one, I immediately assumed its games to be superior to those on my NES since they came on these nifty credit card-sized, well, cards. Bonk's Adventure was one of my particular favorites, but I also happened to be a big fan of the ~blast everything in sight before you can get pummeled by all the baddies in the room~ games. Dungeon Explorer happened to be one of them, and surprisingly, after having not glanced at this title for well over a decade, it has for the most part stood the test of time.   The game draws upon a great deal of inspiration from Gauntlet, and while the gameplay mechanics remain roughly on the same page, certain RPG and action elements help Dungeon Explorer better attain unique status.            The title screen vaults the player into the lush, multi-layered world, displaying the various character types overlooking the mountains, plains, and rivers. After pressing start, you find yourself in the local tavern, where you can select from eight different character types including a Knome, Elf, Bishop, Bard, Witch, Warlock, Thief and Fighter. Each character type has its own strengths and weaknesses, including intelligence, strength, agility and charisma. Where the game has the chance to truly shine is by employing a good balance of character types, making combat more balanced and strategic. This is achievable through the ability to have up to five people play simultaneously, slaying dungeon beasts and looting item power-ups and other goodies.   After selecting your squad and leaving the tavern, the King eagerly calls for an audience and demands that you bring to him crystals of mysterious power. The crystals are located in nearby forests and dungeons and guarded by challenging bosses. Once having collected the crystals, the characters' stats are raised, and levels go up. This adds a little more depth and excitement to the otherwise repetitive gameplay. While it can be fun to wreak havoc and incite mayhem with your pals, the single-player experience can get pretty lonely, as at times the game can get exceedingly and perplexingly difficult. The player is awarded with only three continues, so if you happen to get surrounded by a gang of goblins looking for a good time (perhaps having recently come back from shaving Britney Spears' head), you'll be at the password screen faster than you can say ~breakdown~.    The graphics are what you'd expect from the era, perhaps a little above average. Nothing is overly offensive on the eyes. The title screen is pretty cool with the layered backgrounds and lush scenery. The characters are modeled well, although sometimes it can be pretty difficult to tell what exactly it is that you're shooting swords at, as some of the monsters are truly monstrous.   One facet of the game that noticeably stood out was the wonderful music. After having experienced DTS and Dolby Digital II, I was pretty surprised to actually be impressed by the game's soundtrack. While only 8-bit, the designers still managed to implement a wonderful aural complement to the onscreen carnage. From epic and majestic horns as you traipse through the castle, or ominous and frightening organs while passing through a dark forest; I was constantly impressed. The sound effects in the game are otherwise average and aren't anything ground-breaking.If you happen to be rich both monetarily and socially and can gather three or four people around the TV the game can be quite a blast. The single player quest, unfortunately, isn't all that satisfying and doesn't offer much in terms of longevity.  The low quantity of continues is also quite frustrating, as the game can seem unnecessarily difficult.  If you're a fan of Gauntlet-esque shoot 'em ups, then give this one a go -- especially if you've got the buddies for support.", "date": "Feb 22, 2007"}
