It is a port of the ~arcade smash hit~ made for use in DVD players.  However, Digital Leisure has made the game compatible with Xbox and PS2 controllers and slapped a big Xbox and PS2 Compatible label on the front.  This review serves as a warning for any fool thinking this would make for a quality purchase for their game console.  This is the loosest definition of a game and having played it for longer than any mortal man should, I can assure you that these chumps won't be winning the drug war anytime soon.FeaturesSuperb acting, the kind not seen since the days of Hee-HawFabulous stunts, almost as good as what you'll see at a Knott's Berry Farm showStunning graphics -- They look just like real people!Chilling intensity as you do your damnedest to move the stubborn cursorYou get to kill drug lords, vagrants, hoodlums, and innocents.A laugh riot!Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound (Note: This game is not actually able to leap buildings)GameplayThe story of Drug Wars is pretty simple: Drug lords are ruining the country and you are a Chicago cop hell-bent on killing all of them.  The theme of Drug Wars deserves praise.  It teaches us that drug runners are almost as violent as the police who shoot them and that drugs are bad.  Very, very bad.The only flaw here is that this game is best enjoyed while under the influence of said illegal substances.  That doesn't mean we condone the use of such substances or that we even partake in the occasional toke.  In fact, we're solid upstanding citizens.  And if you're straight like us, this game just won't be nearly as much fun.  It's probable misleading to even call this game ~fun,~ as Drug Wars is more an exercise in masochism than anything else.  Calling it a ~game~ is stretching things as well, but we'll let that one slide.  Drug Wars is a live-action first-person shooter.  We use the term ~action~ loosely, but calling something a live-inaction FPS doesn't seem quite right.  Using the Xbox or PS2 controller (we'll assume you know to use a PS2 controller with your PS2 and an Xbox controller with your 'Box), you guide the target cursor over an area when a baddie pops up.  Baddies jump out one at a time, and your cursor movement is incredibly slow and inaccurate.  Fortunately, the game is constantly pausing to allow you to catch up to the criminals.   Gandhi and Jesse Ventura team up a reality! Assuming you can get the target over the baddie, press A (Xbox) or X (PS2) to fire.  A black hole with a red outline appears where you've shot.  If you're lucky enough to have actually hit the criminal, after about a six-second delay, they will fall over and say something like ~Arrrgh!~ or ~Ungh!~  Should you miss or not fire fast enough, the baddie will shoot and kill you and say something along the lines of ~Ha ha ha ha ha!~ or ~A-ha ha ha ha ha!~  Oh, and if you shoot an innocent, you lose.  That's why it's always good to shoot innocents first, that way the game ends sooner.It's not just that the game is boring, but it's totally unfair.  Sometimes you will have what seems like an endless amount of time to move the targeting cursor over a bad guy (especially thanks to those long, long pauses).  But other times you will have about two seconds, which is not nearly enough time if your cursor is on the other side of the screen. Fran's car being used to mule drugs. It's not enough that there are only a few scenes to work through (each of them involving cops storming in and killing folks), but every moment of gameplay is tedious, slow, and horrendous.  The one positive is just how much you and your buddies will laugh at the game.  It's so bad, the acting so cheesy, that it's impossible not to get a dozen chuckles.  It's either that or start crying.  Anyone who still wants to buy this game (if so, lay off the dope, son), be warned that you'll need an Xbox DVD kit to play this on the big green box.  You will also need a strong will or a Kevourkian-like fascination with the terminally ill to enjoy this tragedy.GraphicsGames like Myst have used real actors and live-action well.  The scenery is creative even though it's still strange to watch people acting as if they are a part of a game.  With Drug Wars, however, you get boring and  clich settings filled with uninteresting scumbags.  The visuals couldn't be more plain, the scumbags any less intriguing.  At least they have filled Drug Wars with some fancy special effects.  Oh no, wait, they didn't.  Worst of all is that some scenes have baddies in dark clothing hiding in the shadows so you can't see them until you've been shot.   Long way down, hommes. SoundStereo has never sounded more boring.  You get gunshots and screeching car tires and a ton of bad dialogue spoken by stuntmen.  ~It's obvious you don't know beans about shooting,~ the sexy female officer tells you after you've been shot.  Those kind of classic lines are few and far between as there's probably only about a dozen lines of dialogue in the whole movie, minus the five-minute intro.Don't let the $30 price fool you.  This game isn't worth it.  However, if you can find it, I highly recommend a rental.  Not only will it give you a new appreciation for good games, but it will give you a real sense of purpose in life.  And that purpose is not wasting your life playing garbage games.  Drug Wars comes with over a dozen trailers for their other games, all of which will give you more laughs than the last three Farrelly Brother movies combined.  This isn't something IGN would normally review, but we felt it fair to warn you, because someone will see a ~PS2~ label on this DVD and be fooled.  This is the Troma of video games.  Actually, Troma makes fun stuff.  This is the Ed Wood of video games.  Stay away.  Stay far away.  And pray for your children, because if this is any indication, the drug war is a long way from being won.", "date": "Jul 24, 2002"}
