With several pieces of gameplay that were lifted from some stellar games it would be hoped that the result would be at least a decent title. But sadly, that's not the case here and the result is a game that provides a clumsy rehash of things that have been around before. For those that are hungry for a new stealth title, Stolen is a possible candidate for a bargain bin purchase, but this is otherwise completely skippable.   Stolen has a couple of different essential elements with its acrobatics and its general stealthy action. The acrobatics are simple areas in which the buxom thief, Anya Romanov, can run, jump, swing, and climb her way through different obstacle courses that are placed throughout the game. There is no goal tall or far away enough to hold Anya back from her target. But really, this game is all about the stealth and the stealing.   The world of Stolen is all about the dark, dark buildings that need to be infiltrated under the cover of night. With a handy light meter to see how visible Anya is at all times the best idea is to sneak around in the shadows to avoid the guards and get to the goods, the goal items that are in the crucial areas or several other items that are scattered about. Anya has a main mission in each of the levels, but that's no reason to avoid taking everything else that isn't nailed down, including the valuable trinkets in the guards' pockets.    It doesn't hurt that the guards are some of the dumbest lunks to inhabit a game. Sure, they'll run after Anya if they spot her and if she shoots out a light over their heads, then they'll wander around for a little bit with their flashlights out, but that's about it. You can move around in the shadows right in front of them, making noise the whole time, and they won't even notice. They'll also just hang in the dark after Anya has shot out all of the lights. Nothing seems to really bother these guys. They're some of the dopiest guys around.   The one thing that the guards are good at is getting back up again after being choked or knocked out. This can be frustrating since there's no way to take care of them on a more permanent basis, like killing them, and in just a minute after they're out they'll be back up on their feet and will call out for back-up. So what's a super-thief to do? Walk right by them or just keep punching them in the face once they do get back up.   In one of the many accidentally funny moments in the game, the fighting system is downright hilarious. It's been simplified down to just one button. There's no guard, no dodge, just a punch/kick button. Watch in amazement as Anya and guard engage in a rousing bout of Slap-a-Face! Thrill at the strategy of knowing when to use a health power-up! Realize that the whole thing is pretty much garbage when the only skill required is tapping a button quickly!     Overall, the action in Stolen is incredibly uninspired. It doesn't help any further that the controls for both the movement and the camera are all thumbs. Even the environments have been given a pretty substandard treatment. With all of the missions taking place in dark buildings there could have been some more effort to make them look different, but the feel is that all the action is in one big place.    With all of this going against Stolen the only bit of interest is the stealth itself. Here it's clear that the developers have played Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid games, but they haven't learned how to make it all that interesting. Sneaking skills are essential, but with the dopey guards it's hard to take it too seriously.   Even though the AI and graphics clearly shouldn't be a tax on the system it apparently still is. The PS2 version has low framerates and lots of aliasing all over the place for a pretty mediocre presentation. The Xbox version may have the cleaner, smoother look, but there are lots of load times that aren't present in the PS2 version. These loads happen in some normal places, such as going to a different view, but they also happen right when a guard shoots his gun or when Anya is crawling through a vent, times when the Xbox should be having it easy. Either way, it's clear that not enough development time was spent on either version.   While the game does progress through levels with different goals and doors to go through, there's very little rhyme or reason as to where to go. Some doors will be locked up tight on one pass-through and will be wide open alter on. A couple of the doors can even be unlocked and then not be opened because those areas have already been cleared. It would've been great if this was explained in the game or in cutscenes to provide more direction, but there is plenty of stumbling around to figure out where the game wants you to go.   Wrap it all up with a very thin story of thieves competing against each other that has some sloppy voice-acting and music and Stolen is a game that's hard to love. In every little detail the game could have benefited from more attention or some more refinement. It's a game like this that truly makes one appreciate all the other stealth games on the market.  In a way, Stolen is a victim of its times. If it had come out a few years ago it's faults would have been easier to overlook. Then again, it clearly copies other existing games and does so in a rather sloppy way. Take it all together and this is a title that can only provide some extra thrills from those who are seriously hurting for more stealth. Only the absolute junkies need apply and even then it will be better to wait until the price drops down about half.", "date": "Apr 20, 2005"}
