Much like the controversial Al Gore-George W. Bush U.S. election of 2000 where Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the judges' over (just kidding, sorta), Konami year-in and year-out owns the purists' hearts and thus, the popular vote. The critics LOVE their Konami soccer, but annually EA continues to sell more copies worldwide, so it's doing more than just a good job at marketing.   Has Konami created a more convincing game for the rest of the world with World Soccer Winning Eleven 7 International? Several changes, upgrades and refinements will easily win over long-time fans and soccer players in general. The gameplay -- AI, team differentiation, ball control, etc. -- has indeed evolved ever so slightly to create an even more compelling title. The graphics are entirely redone, and the sound and presentation all come together well. Very little, in fact, restrains Konami's game from an overall win. But what about those ever-so-slightly skating players? Those clumsy menus? For newbies, that steep learning curve? What about all those tiny little things that have always held back the series from smashing EA's game into dust? Though these are minor points, they still exist.   It's difficult to criticize a game that's so good in so many ways, especially one that brings such a rush of pure soccer bliss. I mean, there's no other game that comes close to beating this one. World Soccer Winning Eleven 7 International has moved forward with some major steps in the bigger areas -- the most important ones -- but small steps in the minor areas: It's not going to win over any FIFA fans or newbies anytime soon with its complicated trading system or arcane menus. Nor will it grab the attention of many US soccer fans, whose focus is most likely Major League Soccer. And what about online play? Those minor complains aside, there's very little else that should keep anyone from honing their skills in the best soccer game on Earth.    Gameplay  In the big picture, the cumbersomely named World Soccer Winning Eleven 7 International has seen a big overhaul in several regards. Rest assured, the gameplay itself, built around real soccer techniques and strategies, hasn't been altered in any major ways. It's the little improvements across the board that Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo (KCET) has made to improve the playing experience.   There are several familiar modes of play: Match Mode, League mode, Cup mode, Master League mode, Training mode, and Edit mode. Match mode enables players to play an exhibition game or shoot penalties; League mode affords players to select from 16 teams in a round robin tournament against the computer AI, none of which include extra time or penalties; and Cup mode gives them the chance to set up custom leagues and cup tournaments. Gamers can customize all sorts of great aspects of this last mode, such as match time; difficulty; cup name (International, European cup, African cup, etc.); eligible teams, competition type, group name, number of teams, number of players, home/away; uniform selection, accumulated fatigue, and injuries. And for a spirited party, players can hook up two Multi-taps for an eight person multi-person bout. The customization aspect of this version is superb.    The new ~Shop~ element follows more traditional EA and FIFA lines of thinking, but they're very welcome additions. Building in more depth to the series, KCET enables gamers to accumulate points through training and exhibition modes, which in turn may be traded for new teams, players, strategies stadia, crowd effects, and even hair styles. Thus, as players complete more seasons, engage in the various modes and flesh out the title's new aspects, they're rewarded with goodies, be they trivial or meaningful. Either way, they add color and variation to a generally predicable annual game.      While I'll get to the visual improvements in a later section, it's important to note that the entirely new graphic engine (which no longer relies on RenderWare), has freed up Konami to create animations and motion-capture movements based on specific player moves. So if your favorite English or Finnish striker pulls off beautiful heel kicks or dribbles with unnatural grace, it's more than likely he can do so here.    The new engine also gives players a new wealth of control. After re-playing several hours of the superb World Soccer Winning Eleven 6 International, I noticed an instant change and improvement in response time and quickness in WSWE7I. Players make better, sharper cuts. The react quickly to situations and make the rather spongy PS2 analog controllers seem less mushy than they really are. Long-range drives and explosive counters are now more manageable than before -- if you're skilled that is (because otherwise the defensive AI is just as sharp as before and will intercept most mid-field passes). Players can perform smooth overhead lobs to a streaking forward (which fall perfectly in front of you when done well), flick it over a defender's head with quick heel kick and perform dazzling cuts and dribbling moves to bypass oncoming defenders.    The game is still based on smart passing and strategic movement to open up defensive lines. Thus, ball physics and powerful passes, kicks and lobs are crucial. The ball moves ever so much better than before, with a visual sense of physics that appears consistently throughout every second of the game. You can see that during curved crosses the ball is spinning with a left or right hook, and when it bounces of the ground or off a player's foot, it performs remarkable realistically. Back spins, side spins, you name it, you'll see it. The consistent physics enables players to do sorts of things well from anticipating defender crosses, to preparing for a through pass for a perfect scoring position. You can really tell how well the ball moves on the goalie bars. If a ball hits the cross bar, it clanks off at any angle, and in a crowded corner situation, you can count on realistic and intense pinball action. You can also just sit back and enjoy as it bounces off defenders' shins on blocked kicks, or out into the open field.   Konami still hasn't figured out the best way to present foul or corner kicks. Given the minute pressure needed to score a goal or to attain that perfect shot, which, believe me, takes time and patience, it's odd that to kick a foul ball or corner kick, determining the power, angle and direction of the ball is still a bit of a crap shoot for newer players. You never really have much idea where the ball is headed until you hone those shoulder button curves. Maybe FIFA has made it easier for us to perform these aspects of the game, but in many ways, it's also made things better. Going back to WSWE7I is to lose a certain amount of control in style and presentation. With regard to throw-ins, the crappy, boggy throw-in scenarios from last year's game has been replaced with better, more utilitarian mechanics in this iteration.     Other aspects feel familiar too. Players may select from 50 national teams, each with updated rosters and star players (which have the real rosters and player names), and 60 ~fake~ club teams. Konami didn't acquire all of the club team licenses, which sucks, but in their stead, it offers an easy-to-use editor to quickly duplicate players' names, accurate uniform colors, name configurations and more. In other words, with a relatively lengthy bit of editing, your real club team is just around the corner.      I'm still mixed about the Master League's trading and acquisition menus. Actually, I'm straight-out not fond of them. They're better than before, but still damn arcane. For one, in the Master League there is no way to determine the quality of your team you want to pick. There are no graphic values indicating teamwork, speed, defense, etc. You just get what you get, as opposed to last year's choices, which clearly indicate which team is lousy, good or mediocre. What's more, being a regular old American, I see at all those European teams and look at who to trade and I just scratch my head. Unless you follow European or international soccer (football, or voila! futball), you're simply lost. Laugh at me if you want, but what is the average Joe Blow going to do when he wants a soccer game and sees this lineup of teams, and these menus? He'll buy FIFA is what he'll do. If you can't figure out the menu system, which takes time and experimentation, it renders the whole management sort of worthless.   If you indeed follow the international standings, there are still cool things to do. Players can track their own team's growing progress in the league, check on other trade-able players and build their team using the newly implemented managerial aspect. Gamers can bid to make acquisitions pre-, mid-, or post-season to improve or their team. Trades often happen automatically during mid season, indicating to players they can either agree or refuse, and of course, they can still be done manually as well.   Graphics  The previous games in the series, at least on PlayStation 2, ran on Criterion's rather impressive middleware, RenderWare. A good tool for development teams that didn't create their graphic engines from scratch, it's done pretty well for the Winning Eleven series. But with WSWE7I, players will find the new graphics engine affects more than visuals, it affects the whole game.    As aforementioned, the newly created animations and motion-capture work are not only beautiful, they're extensive. The range of athletic moves has been expanded to bring individual players to life. They finish off kicks with more realistic flair. The goalie's arms swing in the perfect arch as he hucks the ball downfield. Players stumble after they have the ball stolen from them. Their arms spread wide and they lean back as they take heavy, powerful shots. Athletes push and shove each other -- falling off balance and regaining it -- as they vie for loose balls. There are endless blissful animations seen in realtime and in cutscenes.    Then there are the foul calls, goalie reactions and out-of-bounds calls. KCET has given each player different reactions to foul calls, whether it's shock, dismay or anger. The players wave their hands, shouting at the referee or throw their arms up in the air, or they just walk away shaking their heads. In one scene, the offender walked away and wiped the sweat off his nose. It's just an ordinary detail, but what an ordinary detail to have captured. There are more examples. When a goalie is poorly defended enough times he flails his arms and you can see him yelling and visually growing angry his own players. The intro scenes are also luxurious with fanfare -- confetti, wildly waving fans, flash lights in the crowds and the like.    Normally, I play with the Long intermediate camera, and occasionally I use Wide. But if one selects the Medium or Short camera range the level of impressive detail shines through on each player. The character models display better facial work, more textures on leg muscles, wrinkled or creased clothing, and there are certainly better and more entertaining facial expressions than in WSWE6I. The facial models are especially good looking, with individual players appearing a lot more like their real-life selves. Overall, there is a plush level of impressive realism that gives this game a superb visual feel on all latitudes.   Sound  Technically, KCET has done small impressive things to gradually improve the sound quality of the Winning Eleven series. This year's wrinkles are all par for the course, i.e. predictable. Commentators Peter Brackley and Trevor Brookings have returned for their solid year-in, year-out performance. They occasionally make mistakes, but generally, they do a respectable job of sounding official, which is more than the commentators did in ESPN MLS Extra Time ever did.   The crowd sounds have increased and intensified. In the early presentations, the crowd is so loud that you can't hear the announcers talking. Is that Konami's way of showing better crowd participation and sound? Perhaps. But it does get in the way. On a random note, some button sounds sound like those in Silent Hill. Music-wise, do not expect anthing new; this rather trashy techno is hard on the ears over a period of several hours. Finally and unfortunately, WSWE7I doesn't offer anything but stereo and mono options for sound, so you'll just have to forget hearing that crystal clear sound of Dolby whilst you filter through the menus.WSWE7I a major step for Konami. KCET has started the mammoth process of widening and bolstering the already great gameplay with extra features that are more than just ornamental. I don't like the menus much, but persistent gamers who must rename all their players will get to grips with the Master League's acquisition system and use it to enhance and grow a team that can genuinely contend with the best of them. It's really the graphics engine that is the biggest step. And that affects everything else. Visually, the game doesn't look all the different at first glance. But up close the level of detail is impressive. Everything from the animations to the character models and textures to the cutscenes and the facial expressions on the players themselves have significantly improved. The new graphic engine is also faster, enabling those new animations. But Konami has honed it to the degree that characters exhibit more and better moves. That, and the characters actually react quicker to your commands. All in all, WSWE7I is superb, the best of the bunch. And while it still has a ways to go feature-wise (if you compare it to the latest FIFA), the gameplay is still the best in the business.", "date": "Feb 10, 2004"}
