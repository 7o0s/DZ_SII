{"name": "Tetris Splash", "name_review": "Tetris Splash Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/04/tetris-splash-review", "text": "Though many gamers feel that icons such as Mario or Master Chief serve as the face of the videogame industry, I would argue that the true symbol of videogaming, the character that best defines what gaming is all about, is a square--or perhaps a vertical, four segmented block; or even better, a green or red z-shaped chunk, both of which cause many gamers endless amounts of frustration (they're just so hard to place!). Tetris is everywhere: Cell phones, consoles, wrist watches, and was almost solely responsible for hundreds of thousands of Nintendo Game Boy sales back in the dark ages of black and green screens.   Despite Tetris Evolution being the classic puzzler's first appearance on Xbox 360, Tetris Splash marks the venerable title's debut on Xbox Live Arcade. Unfortunately, this timeless game makes more of a splatter than a wave on Microsoft's arcade service.   First and foremost, Tetris is Tetris, and will always be fun. However, it would be nice, at this stage in the game's life, to see some sort of innovation. Tetris Splash doesn't showcase anything other than the same game all gamers have been playing for decades. The ~Splash~ title comes from a built-in aquarium screensaver that acts as a backdrop for Tetris's blocky action. New fish and aquarium themes can be downloaded--fish packs and themes cost 50 and 160 Points, respectively--and some are quite visually striking. The Atlantis theme shows the mythological city in ruins, while another theme pack depicts a graveyard with a mausoleum casting an eerie green glow from its open doorway, several coffins, and fleshy hands reaching up from the ocean floor.   Still classic, but due for some innovation. Players are given a preset number of fish slots that represent how many fish can occupy the aquarium at a given time, and extra slots can be unlocked by attaining certain Achievements. Gamers seeking a serene atmosphere can activate the screensaver without playing Tetris at all.   While tinkering with the aquarium's settings does provide a bit of entertainment, the main component of Tetris Splash does absolutely nothing to affect the gameplay. They certainly make for lovely backgrounds, but really, who has time to watch a school of goldfish flit to and fro while blocks are dropping all over the place?   Splash's local and online multiplayer modes provide somewhat of a saving grace for the title. Players can join teams in groups of two or three to compete against other identically numbered teams, but Free For All, the most common mode, pits players against five other block droppers in a contest to see who can be the last man standing--or, more appropriately, the last line cleared. Should a game host start a match without the maximum number of players, others are free to join in at any time, and will only have to wait until the current match is complete before becoming an active competitor.   As both a pro and a con, gamers who wish to play another round need not leave the game and search for a new session, as the host can launch another game after play is complete. Unfortunately, modes cannot be changed in between matches, so if a player joins a Team match, that's what he will be playing until he manually leaves and searches for another mode.   Splashing around in single-player consists of the standard Marathon mode, which allows players to stack blocks until their screens are full, and 40 Lines, the objective of which is to clear 40 lines as quickly as possible. That's it; no more, no less. As per usual, the single-player portion of any Tetris game is merely practice for multiplayer, and doesn't have much lasting appeal.Despite including an attractive screensaver, and maintaining the fun factor inherent in almost any iteration of Alexey Pajitnov's classic puzzler, Tetris Splash is dead in the water for those who already own any of the dozens of versions of Tetris available on almost every system. Unless 360 owners don't own a version of Tetris, or have a burning need to play against other XBLA gamers, there's simply no reason to spend $10US to wade into Tetris Splash.", "date": "Oct 4, 2007"}
