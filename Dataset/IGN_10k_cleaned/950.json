However, this is a rather big surprise when you consider where the game is coming from: Namco. The kings of reflex puzzlers brought us Pac-Man, the game that all but defined coin-op addiction. You didn't really have to like it all that much, it just pulled you in, and demonstrated the key ingredient for all good puzzlers: fun. Mr. Driller, on the other hand, lacks any sort of replay enticement. Sure, it's easy to pick up and play, and it's fun, but it's not a long-term kinda game.   Gameplay Mr. Driller's premise is amazingly simple. For some unknown reason, blocks have begun to burst out from underground, and only the poster boy for all things pastel, Mr. Driller, can save the day. Mr. Driller literally lives up to his name; armed with his trusty two-handed drill, he deftly scrambles from self-created gap to gap in an effort to quell the rising tide of blocky doom. Drilling out the blocks that support a block, be it large or small, will cause it to fall until an edge is caught on another block. Problem is, that edge might be the bottom edge, and if Mr. Driller is underneath it when the block hits, you can kiss one of your lives good-bye.   There is, of course, a little more to it, but not much. If one of the edges happens to catch on a block of the same color both the of the sections will disappear. Of course, if there are blocks above the recently vacated space, they will continue to fall. This is where all that blasted thinking comes in. Mr. Driller will only tunnel though one block at a time, but if that block happens to be one space in a huge same-colored block cluster, then the whole structure will disappear. This way you can both create little caves, or wipe out entire sections of the screen. You're also fighting a dwindling air supply, and while just drilling around slowly drops the air meter, drilling into and destroying the harder brown blocks will knock more air off of your meter. Luckily, you can pick up an air pellet, and you'll add more time to the meter.    There's really isn't much more to the game than just drilling (then again, it is a puzzle game called Mr. Driller), and the available modes leave a lot to be desired. You can choose the Arcade mode, where you'll pick a depth of 2,500 or 5,000 feet, and begin drilling your brains out, or opt for Time Attack, where you must tunnel a certain distance in a predetermined amount of time. The time attack mode is insanely hard, but I guess Namco assumed that would add to the replay value. Well guess what, it didn't. If you still can't get enough drilling, there's the survival mode, where you get one life to tunnel as far into the Earth as possible.   Graphics Mr. Driller's graphics are quirky, and definitely fit the very Japanese style of the game. Everything is a variation of a pastel color palette, and while it fits, it's not exactly all that eye pleasing after a while. Initially, you'll see a small 2D picture that represents where you'll begin your grinding descent, but that quickly is replaced by a screenful of pastel block madness.   The game runs at a steady clip, and if it didn't, I would probably have a serious mental breakdown. This is as 2D as games get, and I doubt this game's graphics could push even a Super NES or Genesis to its limits. That's not to say the graphics are particularly bad, they're just simple.    Mr. Driller's menu system is as simple as the rest of the game. You're presented with a simple, unassuming interface that enables you to cycle through the game's available modes. The whole interface is made up of smooth, rounded edges and has a very clean look, but again, isn't anything special. Still, I suppose that simple yet good, it far, far better then complex and terribly executed.   Sound Mr. Driller's music is amazing. Amazing, yes, because it's good, but just as amazing because of it's pure insanity at parts. During the main title screen, the music begins as a plucky, light little ditty that sounds like it could have been played on a small player piano, then seconds later, lurches into a hard-hitting, furious mix of snare and bass, then again is thrown back into the happy former tune. Just when you think the music has finally found a pace, it fades into a light beat-heavy shhh-shhh mix, then moves back into the light-hearted notes. It honestly sounds like the composer suffered from multiple personality disorder and this music was the work of three of them.   However, take a trip to the option menu's sound test, and you'll uncover some of the best puzzle must ever. The music, in some respects, is oh so retro, and sounds a lot like what you'd find coming out of Capcom or Konami back in the early '90s, but with a nice late '90s arrangement and the advanced sound of today's MIDI instruments and sound hardware. Others have sweeping, complex Middle Eastern themes, a little funk guitar thick on the wah pedal, or just simply mix in ambient blends. Hell, there are friggin' bagpipes used in one of the songs. There are nine different songs in the game (Mr. Driller's Theme, Georian, Sala de Masala, Cutie Saurs, Sweet Laboratory, Sagittarius, Star Dust, Susumu Hori, and Spirit of Silk), and some of them have one or more remixes. In all honestly, I had more fun just kicking back and listening to the music in the game than I did playing it. But that's just me.  It's this odd aural dichotomy that makes me wonder if there were actually a couple of different people working on the music, and if so then, ~Hey Namco! nab the guys that did the actual in-game music and make them do more!~ The effects on the other hand, are incredibly simple. Granted, it's a puzzle game, and the effects that are there were done well, from Mr. Driller's ~Thank Youuuu!~ as he grabs a air pellet, to the simple bwok-bwok effects that sound as if they were taken from Bust a Move.   Calling Mr. Driller a good puzzle game is tough, since one type of game can appeal to a person, while the guy sitting next to him can hate it. I didn't find Mr. Driller's gameplay fun or involving, but I can truly appreciate it's addictive qualities for what they are. I think puzzle fans will really like it; it's quirky, different, and speedy arcade fun, but it's no 30 hour game. However, the music totally nabbed me. Its simply stunning orchestrations actually moved me more than most games I've played all year. Let's just hope that the game's music team can get a job somewhere else at Namco where their talents can be better framed with a good, fun game.", "date": "May 24, 2000"}
