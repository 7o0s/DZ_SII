I am afraid of adolescents addicted to drugs.  This game taps all of that fear.  Crave's newest offering, Galerians, is an acid drop in the Survival Horror genre pioneered by Resident Evil. It begins in a dreadful hospital, with inhuman scientists experimenting on a restrained and unwilling young boy. Fittingly horrible, and the game never lets up from there. In fact, it gets much worse. With a gut-gnarling storyline about a telekinetic child, cyborg test subjects who hunt him, PPEC drugs that provide our hero with his only defense while at the same time eating away his body, a computer with a mind hell-bent against humanity, and a pitiless society that welcomes their murder, this game is adult entertainment. It's darker than black, gleefully indulging in sin.  To accuse this game of playing plot and atmosphere over gameplay is a fair cop. In the 10-hour quest, players may come across a total of maybe 50 enemies. Do the math, and you see there's not a lot of action there. Compared to Resident Evil, with its multitudes of puzzles and zombies to brave your way through, Galerians is sleepy and dreary. But it is this eerie pace and stumbling action sequences that give the game its feel and gloomy spirit. The control may be middling, but the ultimate experience is unforgettable.  Story GALERIANS: FORMED 10.01.2519. PURPOSE= GENETIC FUSION AND CLONING TO PRODUCE WORKERS THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE MOST EXTREME CONDITIONS. SYNTHETIC HUMANOIDS CREATED BY DOROTHY. WILL COMPLY WITH DOROTHY DIRECTIVES, AS  PROGRAMMED.  From the very start of this game, there is a class and style in Galerians that is missing from most of the hacked-out, test-marketed, quick-to-sequelize games on PlayStation. Even though the story is familiar, it doesn't feel derivative. The design is heartfelt, elaborate, and clever. For example, any imagined idea of what kind of synthetic zombie might be cooked up by a computer is quickly wiped away when you run into the first creation, a puppet villain called a Rabbit. Ripped straight out of Dark City, true enough, but these villains also set the stage for 1940s noir that becomes the setting later in the game. Very elegant and tasteful.  Once the lead character, a 14-year-old boy named Rion, escapes by way of his psychic powers, Galerians is a maddening decent into industrial hell. Whereas Resident Evil mostly shocked with zombies jumping out from closets and corners (and Galerians has its fair share of those instances), the fear in this game comes mostly in shocking plot twists. Bodies of loved ones are found locked up in cabinets in your family home. Scan or touch an object and Rion may have an amnesic flashback to his childhood before returning to this nightmare. In one instance, a man gives you a hint on where to find your missing friend. Search down the clue, and you'll find that it was a red herring. Why would the man mislead you? The question is never answered. When Rion returns to question the man again, he finds his bloodied corpse stuffed in a bathroom stall.  Even if you don't enjoy the gameplay, which is a matter of taste and does have its issues, respect must be given to this game's panache and uncompromising vision. There are slip-ups (Rion finds rooms filled with guns but doesn't take any, and will trust a person even though we, the player, know that being to be a malicious Galerian), but the overall approach is astute and well-researched.   This is exquisite storytelling, rigidly mature and rightfully unsuitable for children. When Rion comes across a drug dealer, the peddler spots him as an addict. He says he can tell -- the boy's face is wasted. In a rundown hotel's penthouse suite, a man sits on the bed with a bottle in one hand and a high-powered rifle with scope in the other. Down a flight, Rion will find a hooker who despises men and cries when he enters. In another room, a man is building a bomb to blow up the city. Any door can be scanned to see what nefarious sin is being contemplated.   Crave should be commended for keeping this Japanese import (created by Polygon Magic) intact. Not only is the plot sinister as can be, filled with sin and immoral activity, but the main weapon of the underage lead character are drugs. Rion pops pills to refill his health, and shoots up to inject his psychic powers with narcotic fuel. To see a mere boy bingeing on drugs, which indeed have their negative affects on his body as you play, is alarming and yet emotively captivating.  Gameplay Galerians has been called ~Resident Evil minus the guns,~ and while we hoped this would end up being more, that really is the extent of it. It's a fun trip, but not nearly mind-blowing. Rion has psychic powers that able him to will attacks on foes with his mind. Psychic blasts of Nalcon fire force beams at opponents, and waves of Red cause the enemy to ignite in fire. Neither has trajectory animation (the attacks act kind of like Gambit's card throw in the Capcom fighters), and the moves halfway auto-aim, leading players to feel there isn't much to the battle gameplay. Boss battles are a more delicate affair, and are challenging fun, but attacking is a very low-key element in the game that should have been given more focus.  On that note, there are only three attacks (Nalcon, Red, and a third you find much later in the game), so gameplay is very simple compared to Resident Evil. You cannot combine drugs and make hybrid weapons like in RE3, so the weapons are limited. (And how freaky would that be to insanely mix drugs and dose mystery capsules?)   Also, Rion has an Addiction/Anger Meter that builds whenever he takes a drug and uses it for as psychic attack. That gives a great deal of strategy to battles, because when Rion is maxed on AP, he ~shorts,~ which means he becomes a walking time bomb. His health and maneuverability rapidly drop, as he stumbles around with a crushing migraine, until he finally falls down dead. Neatly, this headache also makes his psychic powers go haywire, sending out shocks that pop the head of anybody who comes near him, Scanners-style.  Unfortunately, Polygon Magic has misstepped in the game design by having Rion's AP build even when he's not under the influence. The idea was constantly raised levels of panic, because every room you explore is another notch toward ~shorting~ to death. In practice, however, gameplay is hurt by this because gamers max out even when they're not doing anything wrong. Combine this with the fact that the relieving drug for the Anger/Aggression is in crucially short supply, and you have a game where it's best to avoid battles altogether. That's like a Resident Evil where gamers are too afraid to have Chris Redfield fight zombies or explore too many rooms for fear of their STARS hero becoming suicidally depressed by the horror and turning the gun on himself.  Without a lot of puzzles to solve, and a limited amount of action, the game is much more fittingly equated to old 2D adventures like Clock Tower or Phantasmagoria. Bosses and battles are there to break up the gameplay more than provide it. And, in that sense, the control is heavy but fine. For instance, battling any more than a single Galerian is near impossible, but that's part of the appeal. If you find yourself in that situation, it's better to use your mind than you mental forces. Dumb gamers who wade into trouble with a trigger finger will wind up dead every time. When the game falls into a key action sequence, the control works about as well as Resident Evil ever did. That means that Rion spins on his heels and has trouble maneuvering tight corridors or jutting objects (just like RE, even Code: Veronica), but is still plenty able to face his foe once gamers learn the quirks of first-person control in a third-person view.   In the thick of things, Galerians is a minor let-down in terms of gameplay. It's a lesser Resident Evil, with fewer options and more restrictive gaming rules (Rion even has a limited pouch for his drugs, meaning he may not have enough stock for a battle with a boss, even though the supply is plenty). The control ends up in a more minimal game than could be desired, with a linear adventure, patterned bosses, and frustrating simplicity. This is a very calculated game, and it's not for everyone.But if you're having withdrawal symptoms from weak stories, cliched characters, and copped-out, mass-market pulp, Galerians is pure snow. Give credit to Crave for an adult game that really is for adults. Bored, hyperactive kids have no place here, and while I would have loved more layered gameplay, this mature quality is much appreciated. When I play Quake, I laugh whenever a zombie explodes or has his head popped off. Galerians, for once, took everything seriously, like an old horror movie mixed with modern sensibilities. Skewering religion, government, technology, abuse, drug culture, and much more, Galerians made me afraid again. And that is a good thing.", "date": "Apr 6, 2000"}
