Everyone who owns a console should own that game, and everyone who played it and loved it has been waiting for the next one to show up. At one time we here at IGNPSX thought that Tomorrow Never Dies might be the next one (for obvious reasons), but that's not how the land lies. After a couple attempts with the Jurassic Park license, Dreamworks finally has scored a knockout punch with the World War II first-person shooter, Medal of Honor. This game gets that honor.  Gameplay If there was one game that truly stood out from the pack, it's Medal of Honor. Authentic and original to its core, MOH is an example of how the Dreamworks team took the Saving Private Ryan sentimentality into its development studio and showed everyone that first-person shooters don't have to follow the standard route. That they can be done on the PlayStation, and that they don't have to be PC ports to great. While taking nods from Rare's Goldeneye, Medal of Honor has a flavor all its own.   As a new member of the Office of Strategic Services, your character Jimmy Patterson has been summoned to perform several services. With the trappings of World War II soaking every pixel and polygon of this game, you will find that your world is the most genuine reproduction of World War II in any videogame on consoles today. Your missions range from simple shoot-and-meet-your-target sessions, to subterfuge, to stealth and disguise missions, to planting bombs, to sneaking through and jamming the engine of a German submarine. Each mission becomes increasingly difficult as you progress through more than 20 of them, and each is firmly entrenched in a solid storyline that's delivered before and after each mission with a superb interface.   Your weaponry is based on the real deal. Players are presented an original arsenal, ranging from the Thompson SMG, Stielhandgranate (potato masher), the M1 Garand, Browning automatic rifle, shotgun, bazooka, to the Colt 45, and a Mark II Frag Grenade, to name a few. And they all work just like back in the day (I think...). With the rifles, for instance, you take a few shots and then reload. It's in those few seconds you're really vulnerable, but so is the enemy. And while you can see the shot of your bullet in the wall or mountainside (a touch that's old but still nice), you can't see the bullet shells falling to the ground. You can hear them, instead, a concept that works just as well.   You will spend a lot of time interfacing with Nazi soldiers. Not just shooting them. But getting past lower ranked officers and speaking with them. You don't actually speak, but the game boasts 1,500 lines of unique dialog in which you and your allies and enemies converse. After each mission, a gravelly-voiced old captain directs your next mission with great discern.   The range of play is great. Sometimes you simply run and shoot. Other times, you must be stealthy. Players can disguise themselves as German commanders and militia, and stroll through enemy headquarters and encampments unnoticed, able to look through top secret files in offices and meeting rooms. By toggling through your inventory, gamers can simply flip out their badge, and the Germans accept allegiance. Usually. Occasionally, higher ranked German officers won't believe you, holler ~Imposter!~ or ~Guards!~ or ~Sound the alarm!~ and shoot. The AI is especially good, and forces you to play smart to win.  As we've been saying all along with MOH, the little touches make the difference. With grenades, it's all new. Throw your grenade in the perfect spot, and watch the Nazi soldier nearest pick it up and throw it right back. It may kick or lob it in another direction as well. The Germans always had dogs around, and these German Shepherds are more than just a mouth with rabies. They're trained. Throw a grenade when a German Shepherd is around, and it will pick up the grenade and if you are close, bring it back to you in Kamikazi fashion.  Here is an example mission:  In this new mission you'll take on the disguise of a Kreigsmarine officer on a German freighter bound for Germany. On board the merchant marine vessel Wolfram, you'll need all your wits to survive the trip to Bremen. Bremen is home to the U-Boot production facility known as Dachsmag. Here the Nazis are building U-4901, their largest submarine yet.   After ditching your Kreigsmarine uniform, sneaking onto the Dachsmag and boarding the U-4901 before it launches is crucial to the mission. While out at sea, you'll need to radio in coordinates to the Allies, scuttle the submarine, then exit out the hatch when the sub temporarily surfaces before plunging to its watery doom.  Here are several of the levels and objectives    Escape The Wolfram   Gain access to promenade   Gain access to bridge   Find wrench   Gain access to engineering   Jam engine   Exit ship through cargo hold   The Rooftops Of Dachsmag   Locate smuggled weapons   Secure deployment timetable   Blow up truck with demo charges   Find hatchway to production facility   The Hunter's Den   Find engine specs   Find hull blueprints   Destroy sea door control   Locate and board U-4901   Dive!   Radio coordinates to Allied intelligence   Lock fins to dive setting   Destroy fin controls   Blow ballast to surface boat   Find exit hatch   After every mission, players will receive a full readout of their work. The stats are awesome. Players can learn how many legs, arms, heads, torsos, groins and crotches they hit, as well as receive a metal, rewarding you for how well you performed (or didn't). You also receive a nickname, depicting the kind of soldier you are, like ~potato masher~ or ~headhunter~ or ~arm slinger.~   As for as the control goes, the analog control works better than the Dpad, but both provide a stuttering effect that can be extremely annoying. That's the biggest complaint I have, in fact. The control is sticky and oftentimes downright frustrating. It seems as if the team needed about two more weeks to fix it, but didn't have the time. For about 85% of the game, it won't effect you, but on occasion, you'll see other characters stutter, and for the last 15% you will wish it was fixed.   In the two-person mode, you'll find the same problem affects play. And especially in a quick jam. It's irritating as anything, and it makes this near perfect game not so perfect. Graphics MOH is a dark game. And it's not really the prettiest game I've ever seen, either. Many of the missions appear at night. Not only that, but many missions are affected by a draw-in technique that's sketchily clouded by a super dark wave of graphics. Once you can actually see the interiors and landscapes, you'll notice two things: detailed textures and a good amount of pixelly walls; when you get up close, that is. Still, the pixelly weirdness seems to blend into the WWII theme a little, and you really forget about all that stuff when in the heat of battle. In the single-player mode, the game has a good, solid frame rate and a clear, appropriate palette for the game. The frame rate in the two-player mode is not as solid. It holds up for the most part, but it still drops through in frames enough to clearly see -- and be bothered -- by it.  As for the little things that we keep talking about. Dreamworks provides great animations for the soldiers before, during, and after getting shot. The game is very ~Goldeneye~ that way, and sometimes it's just fun to watch and see what they do.  Don't be fooled by these criticisms. I noticed them but enjoyed the game immensely, just the same. As with all games, it's the gameplay that matters, and MOH has gamneplay to spare. Sound The sound effects and voices in MOH are some of the best sounds ever on a PlayStation game. The ongoing sounds of soldiers yelling, bombs exploding, and bullet shots ricocheting off walls, mountainsides, and helmets is phenomenal. Technically, the sound is brilliant. There's even a song called The Road to Berlin (Radio Berlin). You simply must hook this game up to your stereo and listen to it loud as you play.    As for the music, MOH continues its path of originality. A full orchestra plays the songs created exclusively for the game. The music was composed and produced by Michael Giacchino, who completed 17 songs. The great orchestral music fits perfectly with the game and is authentic to the bone. And all throughout the game, players hear lots of cool extras. When you change from menu to menu, you hear the military snare drum rap quickly, while in others that follows with a bass drum, and in each it all sounds a little like taps. There is little to say here except this: go buy it, and go buy it now. You won't be disappointed.", "date": "Nov 19, 1999"}
