Charged by Earth's elite with protecting their exclusive 'dome' cities, the JDA is locked in an ongoing battle to pacify the masses of urban 'Sprawlers' who dwell in the toxic, irradiated world outside. It is not until the occurrence of a single, catastrophic event, however, that the Sprawlers unite their unconventional technologies and weaponry to engage the JDA in the violent drama of Earth's final chapter...~   Hell, I'd give him an 'A.' On second thought, I'd give him an 'F.' Not only did he steal that idea from Dark Reign 2, Dark Reign 2 stole it from just about every other bleakly Apocalyptic 'the future is hell' game out there.  Anyway, here's a sequel to an old 2D real-time strategy game Activision put out a couple years ago. Actually it's a prequel, because it takes place before Dark Reign 1 -- thank you, George Lucas. But that doesn't matter. This is a brand 3D new engine, a whole new setting, and more or less a brand new game, and it doesn't make any difference if you played the first one or not. So let's get to it.  The Good  First off, the game's a beaut. I had fun just zooming the camera around the 3D environment and watching my guys go at it from every conceivable angle. The camera's also very easy to use, easier in fact than similar set-ups like Myth or Shogun, and faster too: there are six preset zoom/angle levels mapped to the function keys, while holding down 'F' and moving the mouse puts you in free camera mode. (There are also some pre-set camera angles set to the number pad but I found these disorienting and ultimately useless. Your preferences may vary of course; it's enough that all these different tools are there.)   Of course you don't have to play it in 3D mode; one of the views is a straight overhead perspective so you can in fact play it as a 2D strategy game if you must (in fact, there are some advantages to this, particularly in multiplayer -- it can be easier to see what's going on). So you don't have to hang back from this one even if 3D makes you queasy.  Then again, a super camera is nothing if there's nothing to look at, but that's not a problem here. The terrain types are pretty standard--cityscapes, wooded hills, snowy mountains--but it's the scale and detail of the landscapes which are impressive. Raindrops hit the water, polygonal signs light up and blink off and on, day turns to night, snow falls in gentle flurries.   And the scale! When these guys decided to make a 3D game, they weren't going to settle for the gentle slopes and wimpy valleys of other games. These are some serious mountains, people. Pandemic has built themselves a veritable Mount Everest of 3D terrain. In fact sometimes they got a bit carried away, as on some of the darker maps, it can be hard to navigate around these gigantic outcroppings of bytes.  The engine seems pretty robust too. I didn't have any crashes and lock-ups, even when I was running a screen capture program in the background -- I didn't even realize that the game took its own screen shots, and so was taking two screen shots every time. Now that's idiot proof.  And while it's a fairly common practice now, Dark Reign 2 also uses its own engine to do the cut scenes. What's interesting here is that these are also somewhat dynamic: what I mean is, while they do use pre-scripted camera tracks and pre-recorded audio, your units in the cut scene will be the same types and numbers as whatever group triggered the in-game event. Pretty nifty. The only thing I didn't like about it was that too often the cinematics interrupted the action, abruptly turning you from active participant to passive observer. Uncool.  At any rate, you can tell the designers were really proud of their engine, they even used it in the menu screen. When you first enter the game, you see what looks like a standard menu, but click on an option, they whisk you off down a street to another menu. Neat-o.  Anyway, enough about the graphics and the engine. By now you get the idea that there's some serious horses powering these pixels.  So what else is good? The interface is easy to use without cluttering up the screen, yet powerful enough to give you total control over your forces. The unit AI options are solid, but the best thing are the build queues in the lower left hand corner, which means you don't have to scroll back to your base every couple of minutes to give more production orders. And of course with what seems like a near infinite build queue, you shouldn't have to anyway. Very easy to group and recall all your units too, without any annoying limits on how many troops can be in a group. In fact, my only problem with the interface was with the mini-map, but I'll save that for later.  The game is also very feature rich. There's an editor for map-making junkies, replay files that you can trade with your friends, and supposedly there's even some editable text files for rule-tweakers (although I couldn't actually find them). You can even export your combat stats as HTML files--help spruce up the old home page, I guess. Besides the two campaigns in the single player game, you can also play in skirmish mode and there are plenty of multiplayer variants to keep you busy too. You can even play the single player game in co-op mode, something too few games include nowadays.  Ultimately, though, how well the game does and how long it lasts (especially on the multiplayer side) depends on you, the gamers out there. If enough people get into Dark Reign 2 to form a regular community of online players, map editors, and all the rest of it, than the game can be considered a success. But if a couple months from now all the DR2 chat rooms on WON are as empty as a Battlefield Earth convention, well, something's wrong. And don't think that can't happen -- a couple other RTS games are hitting right about now, and of course, Diablo II just came out.  The Bad  Ah yes, pathfinding. This simply wouldn't be a real-time strategy game without a lot of dumb ants bunched up around a choke point. Actually, pathfinding's come a long ways since the dark days of Warcraft II. It's the lack of formations, the bunching up, and the fact that in large groups the guys in the back stand around and do nothing that irritated me. What are these guys, union labor?! I have to pay for ten guys, but only five do any work?  Much worse is the mini-map. It simply sucks. It's too small, it's too dark, there's no detail, and since DR2 maps have such massive terrain features using the mini-map to send troops somewhere is like dropping paratroops into a hurricane. Who knows where they'll end up? I'll tell you: usually right into some fixed turret defenses.  Things aren't much better when it comes to all the touchy feely crap, either. I already joked about the storyline in the intro, but the units are no great shakes either -- I could care less about either side, I don't know what they're fighting for, and none of the units are cool little dudes you'd actually remember. There's none of the charm of Warcraft II here, for example, or the sheer alien wow-factor of Starcraft, just a bunch of guys in futuristic tanks and generic looking battle suits. Sure, not everybody can design characters as cool as Warhammer, but at least put some effort into it.  Some of the missions were way too puzzle-y and linear for my tastes too. One in particular, the JDA mission where you have to guide some giant rolling monolith out of a cave full of kamikaze exploding cultists (don't ask) really had me choking on my own rage. Not only was this one of those stupid missions where you don't get to build any bases or make new units, it also wasn't very clear exactly where you were supposed to drag this stupid slow piece of junk monolith to in the first place. Why do tedious 'do this or die' puzzle missions always show up in what are supposed to be strategy games?  All this stuff I can live with. But our final topic, Dark Reign 2's appallingly generic game design, really bugged the crap out of me, and it's what ultimately is going to make me put this game away as soon as this review is done.  The Ugly  ~The latest round of real-time strategy games have left me pretty numb. More tanks, more factories, more resources, more fiddly controls; in a word, more Command & Conquer.~ I wrote that three years ago in a review of another RTS game, but by and large it still holds true today, especially for Dark Reign 2.  Build a base, send out the collectors, gather the Tiberium -- excuse me, the Taelon -- crank out the units, explore the map, and then bum rush the other guy. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this design but how many times have we played it before? In contrast, look at first-person shooters, which at first were just a never-ending parade of Doom clones (does anyone remember Powerslave, Shadow Warrior, Eradicator, GREED?) but today vary from RPG-style story games like Deus Ex or Thief to hardcore multiplayer action games like Tribes and Team Fortress, and everything in between.  The RTS genre isn't even close to being this interesting. Sure, a few games are starting to mature and deal with unit morale, ammunition, realistic weapon ranges, accrued experience, leadership bonuses, over-arching campaign games, and God forbid, actual tactics, but most aren't. Most are still stuck in 1996, tweaking this and touching up that, but never really getting away from the intrinsically silly and by-now horribly cliched model of gathering up balonium to produce fearless super-units out of thin air. Sadly, Dark Reign 2 is one of these.  In the end, Dark Reign 2 is what it is: a formulaic real-time strategy game married to state of the art technology and cutting edge visuals. For some people, that's probably enough, but I can't help think that a lot of great technology was wasted on what's ultimately a boring and predictable design. It'd be like id Software going back and doing Doom III.  Um, wait a minute...  --Jason Bates    Comment on this story", "date": "Jul 8, 2000"}
