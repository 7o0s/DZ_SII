{"name": "Doom", "name_review": "Doom PlayStation Version Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/22/doom-5", "text": "You know it, you love it. It's everybody's favorite first-person shooter, and the godfather of way too many bad games (although that's not really the title's fault). It's Doom, and it's the best conversion yet. The high frame rate, impressive light-sourcing effects, and responsive controls make this second to none.The game supports the underused PlayStation Link Cable, so two players with two copies of the game, two systems, and two PlayStations can go head-to-head, just like all those PC gamers. The disc includes not only a complete port of Doom II, but a new version of the original Doom, Ultimate Doom. Chain Gunners, Revenants, and other enemies from the sequel have been thrown in spice up to the game, which feels more like one long game than two distinctly separate ones.While there are a few problems with control, most noticeably in turning corners, the game looks great. Let's face it, though, Doom is starting to get a little old. But if you want a faithful conversion of it, this is the one.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
