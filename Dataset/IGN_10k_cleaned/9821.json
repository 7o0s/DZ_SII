{"name": "Jeopardy", "name_review": "Jeopardy", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/20/jeopardy-4", "text": "Because of its tricky monochrome screen, games with a lot of motion and animation are often hard to pull off on Game.com. On the other hand, quiz show games and the like usually work out well since the screen is a bit larger than on most other handhelds. Jeopardy, based on the long-running, popular TV show is no exception.  Players enter their name and select their character of choice to compete either with the computer or a friend via the Compete.com link cable. Game controls are as straight forward as the quiz show's format. Select one of the randomly determined categories by pressing directly on $ field on the Game.com's touch screen, then press the ~OK~ field at the bottom of the screen. The question will appear with the opportunity to buzz in. You will have 10 seconds to hit the buzzer, however, other contestants can of course buzz in before you if you're not quick enough.  The answer screen displays the answer, followed by an incomplete question (remember, it's Jeopardy, so every answer is in question form). Using on-screen letters, laid out like a simple keyboard, players enter the word in question in a 45 second time limit. The typing system takes some getting used to, but it works out well once you've utilized it a couple of times.  All the features from the show are here, including Double Jeopardy, Final Jeopardy and The Daily Double, but the game's a bit weak on the presentation side. The music at the beginning barely sounds like the Jeopardy theme, there's no Alex Trebek and many of the typical Jeopardy noises didn't make the cut. There is some speech, but it's limited to only a few sentences. Jeopardy works quite well on Game.com. Because of its larger screen, the programmers managed to fit all the category columns (the titles are only slightly abbreviated) and the touch screen controls are intuitive. The speech samples are a nice touch, but there should have been a little more in the ways of presentation. Jeopardy is a fun little distraction for people who like to test their knowledge on the go. Don't expect long-term play value, though. There is a fair number of categories and questions, but you will notice that categories are already repeated after a few games.", "date": "Jul 20, 1999"}
