{"name": "Wings", "name_review": "Wings", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/02/10/wings-3", "text": "for the Game Boy Advance marks the third (and potentially last) game in the Cinemaware line of classics ported to the Nintendo handheld, joining the other two games, The Three Stooges and Defender of the Crown on store shelves. It's probably the least known of the three games that shipped during the age of Cinemaware, but judging by the game design that's been brought over to the GBA, it's arguably the most involving of the lot. Part dogfighting and part shooter, Wings is a cool collection of three different game designs that, while fun in their own right, can't stand on their own because of gameplay limitations. Features Allieds or Germans More than 220 different missions Three different gameplay modes Cartridge save (ten slots) Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  There's nothing ~simulation~ about Wings. This GBA game takes the situations and scenarios from the fight between the Allieds and Germans during the first World War, building action-style game designs from the aerial combats during that era. Players start off as a rookie pilot and travel through the ranks as either a member of the Allieds or the Germans. There are three different types of missions: dogfighting, strafing and bombing runs, and moving through the missions depends entirely on performance within the previous missions. Perform well and you'll help the side's army in their fight for dominance during the war. Fail to accomplish the task, and it will set back the side's advancement during the on-going battle. Your pilot only has one life to live, so losing him in the midst of combat means you'll have to start fresh with a rookie pilot...which is definitely not desirable since any attribute points earned in the career (flying, shooting and mechanical abilities, as well as stamina), will be lost if that pilot perishes. The war can continue without him, though...but those not willing to say goodbye to their pilot can just quit without saving to cartridge and restart the mission to correct that fatal error.  The dogfighting missions are the meat of Wings. Most of the challenges in the game take place in this game design, which actually looks good and plays well on the GBA system. It's essentially the first real flight simulator on the handheld, giving players a decent feel of ~you are there~ in a bi-plane as they fly and battle against enemy craft, as well as take out (or protect) observation balloons that are peppered around the battlefield. Because the developer used scaling sprites and rotating backgrounds for the 3D engine, the dogfighting gameplay is extremely smooth and responsive. One huge issue, though: no throttle control.  Since players can't control their airspeed (except when climbing or diving), it's extremely difficult to pull off skillful maneuvers or keep on an enemy's tail. And because the graphics engine doesn't offer any real ground detail other than the occasional shrub or tree, it's difficult to tell how high the plane is off the ground...which may not sound important since most of the mission takes place in the air, but in many cases players will have to try and land their damaged craft, and without any surface texturing for the ground, it's not second nature.  The strafing missions are very much like Desert Strike, but with players controlling much more limiting biplanes instead of the EA series' versatile gunship copters. In these missions, players are set to the task of taking out soldiers, vehicles, anti-air guns, or even local structures before their fuel runs out. Many missions also restrict what should not be shot down as well; taking out churches or medical facilities, for example, is a no-no. Players have limited control over altitude to avoid enemy fire, and pilots can also increase the speed of their plane with a button push (something that the dogfighting controls lack). The engine the developers use for these missions is actually based upon one of Crawfish Interactive's very first Game Boy Advance graphical demonstrations, which goes to show just how long this game was in development. It certainly has evolved since then, though the shadow that the plane casts on the ground looks very awkward since it's simply a colorless sprite copy of the plane overlaid on the ground...and since it lacks distortion, the 3D look that the developers are trying for is slightly ruined. But 3D effect aside, these strafing missions are pretty fun, and aren't nearly as difficult to complete as the nigh-impossible ones in Desert Strike  The bombing runs in Wings are probably the missions with the least amount of gameplay depth, as they're simply overhead versions of the strafing missions. The same controls apply in these bombing runs, except players don't have machine guns...they have bombs. Dropping bombs on desired targets will cause these structures to explode, but players have a set number of bombs to take out the mission's specific targets. The missions in these levels are a little cryptic; players are shown the targets before the mission starts via a map screen, with the targets highlighted by a large, hand-drawn circle. Problem is, several missions have many more targets to hit than the ones that are marked by the map's circle...so failing here is easy to do since the mission doesn't explain that there are additional targets to hit than the ones that are indicated. Other than this little gripe, the bombing runs are pretty decent...if just a little stale.   Of all the Cinemaware games to hit the Game Boy Advance, Wings is a game I never played in its original Amiga form...which means I cannot make any comparisons between it and this conversion on the Game Boy Advance. I can say that Wings on the GBA is an enjoyable game with three different styles of gameplay, all of them with their own pros and cons. The dogfighting levels are easily the best of the bunch, but also the one with the most gameplay issues. These missions are very reminiscent of Warbirds on the Atari Lynx, easily one of the best four-player link games on that system...and like that game, Wings' dogfights can be networked between four GBA systems as well. But the lack of a throttle control as well as an altimeter hurts the enjoyment...but you can overlook these omissions you'll have a good time. The other two mission-styles, the strafing and bombing runs, are nice diversions from the dogfighting levels; without them, the game's dependence on the dogfighting would have definitely gotten old quickly. The entire package could have used a few more tweaks to tighten up the gameplay, but overall it's an enjoyable arcade-style take on the WWI air combat theme.", "date": "Feb 10, 2003"}
