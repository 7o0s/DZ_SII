Never one to let a good franchise die, THQ Wireless has wisely re-upped the series for duty on mobile. Red Faction is not the first time a FPS has made the transition to handsets. JAMDAT's DOOM RPG was a megawatt success last month. But Red Faction rebirth as a top-down shooter more like the old PSone series Loaded isn't as delicious of a solution as JAMDAT's RPG formula.   Red Faction follows the plight of oppressed workers under the nefarious Ultor's reign, a corporation so mean it shuts down infirmaries in its mining facility to save money. You are a worker who is mad as hell and not going to take it anymore, thusly launching into a plot to overturn the company and free the rest of the oppressed workers. All you need is a gun and a lot of luck.   Guns are in no short supply in Red Faction, and neither is ammunition. Inside a good number of crates and around corners (often guarded by Ultor thugs), you will find extra ammo dumps to keep your pistols and machineguns well fed. You can also use things like exploding barrels to eliminate the enemy -- just shoot the barrel when a bad guy is within it's blast radius (helpfully marked by a shockwave) and he falls down.   Ultor has stocked the maze-like mines and facilities with plenty of guards, too -- all the more to shoot. You must use the ~8~ and ~#~ keys to strafe while pressing ~5~ to fire your selected weapon. This scheme works okay in theory, but during a protracted firefight, you may forget that if facing right, pressing ~*~ will make you sidestep up. It's just one of those things that takes some getting used to.   Missions have multiple objectives, such as finding certain characters or just plain old escape, which are marked on an on-screen map. The map doesn't reveal the exact layout of a level, but the placement of a red dot (the objective) on the square certainly helps guide you -- perhaps a little too much, even. It's not impossible to burn through several levels up Red Faction before finishing your can of Diet Mountain Dew.   The top-down switch just doesn't work like it should. The strafing controls and the small screen that obscures enemies just out of view. The controls especially become annoying when facing off against small, bug-like bots. Because you are much wider than your stream of fire, you have to carefully jockey your hero into position. As you try to make that perfect ~line up,~ you give the bugs plenty of time to bump you and steal health.  I was actually happy to see THQ Wireless take on Red Faction, and even though I think this solution (go top-down) doesn't play out as well as other FPS-to-mobile solutions, I hope it's something THQ Wireless revisits again. The controls are a little too touchy -- especially the strafing. The game looks decent enough, with larger sprites (you can even see your character's legs move as he runs) that appear clear on a test LG VX8000. There are just too many good games out right now that I would have to recommend over Red Faction for your download dollars for me to give the game a thumbs up.", "date": "Oct 28, 2005"}
