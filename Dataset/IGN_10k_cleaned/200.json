Basically, different icons drop down a well. The icons are either food (bamboo, carrots, bones, or bananas), or animals (pandas, rabbits, dogs or monkeys). When a food icon touches the appropriate animal icon, the animal eats it, and any other adjacent icons of the same food. Remaining icons slide down, ready to combine, and the icons that vanish are quickly sent to your opponent's well.The possibilities for combos are amazing (it feels a little like Columns in that respect), and of course, getting a good combo sends a bigger package to your opponent. It sounds simple, but you'll quickly find that this is an addictive two-person puzzler. There is a one-player mode, but we found that the AI wasn't really enough to keep us challenged for long. If you have a friend, you'll want Baku Baku.", "date": "Dec 1, 1996"}
