Usually attributed to the somewhat complicated commands needed to control your units, build a base, and perform other tasks quickly enough to make a difference on the battlefield, the lack of a truly large RTS library for the PlayStation 2 is rather noticeable. In fact, with the exception of 3DO's Army Men installment from earlier this year, the genre is next to invisible here in North America (Europe was lucky enough to snag Age of Empires II quite some time ago).Ubi Soft and French Developer Mathematiques Appliquees (MASA) hope to change all that however, with the ported release of one of the last Dreamcast games to ever grace the system (it was released for PC also, but this particular version is from the console rendition). Known as Conflict Zone and quietly released this past October, the out of nowhere RTS had almost slipped from under our games radar without so much of a hint of its existence. Apparently that was for good reason though, as after playing it we couldn't help but find ourselves seriously disappointed.GameplayTo be truthful, the general premise behind Conflict Zone is really quite admirable. Unlike most Real-Time Strategy games, conquering your opponents with a bevy of weapons isn't enough to win the war. You must instead gain the support of ICP High Command by staying out of trouble when the news cameras are close and influence the media further by gaining decisive humane victories on national television. A positive popularity score will then allow your engineers to build bigger and better items from the technology tree while gaining even stronger support from your troops;  they'refore helping to create a more powerful war machine in your favor. It's an interesting approach to the usual ~build and kill~ mentality found in just about every other RTS title out  they're, but it's still not enough to save this one from going under.The most obvious problem is the dumb as bricks computer A.I. --A truism when speaking of both your own characters and your opponents as well, the armies from either side wander around the map in the same apathetic mood that you'll find yourself in whilst playing. Ordering your soldiers to do something other than stand  they're is supposedly possible according to both the instruction manual and the long-winded in-game tutorial, but 90% of the time doesn't really work that way.  Rather than go from point A to point B when you tell them to, your soldiers will first walk as far away from their starting point as possible before moving towards their destination in a pattern only they are familiar with. And while this type of movement would make sense if  they're were a large obstacle between the two clicks, it happens regardless of the terrain or situation. Even if the traveled distance is less the length of your entire base, your grunts, jeeps, tanks, and various other units meander around like inebriated cockroaches.Once the battles finally do commence, they aren't all that spectacular either. Boring exercises in ~you fire, then me~, the back and forth skirmishes are nothing more than tests of whoever has the most and strongest units. Strategy isn't really a viable description when speaking of Conflict Zone as eight times of ten, the only determining factor as to who wins a battle or not is whichever side built the most units before attacking. And though your soldiers and vehicles can improve their abilities through a limited experience point system, its affect on the battlefield is seldom seen.Of course,  they're have been plenty of other army games in the RTS genre that worked via the ~most units~ mentality and still managed to be incredible amounts of fun. PC favorite and Cavedog legend Total Annihilation in particular conjures up vivid memories of epic proportions, while similar titles like Shogun: Total War and Warcraft II chime in to a lesser extent. What separates games like those from Conflict Zone however, were not only their excellent presentation, but also how easy they were to get into. Ubi Soft's own stab at the genre offers neither of those, with the control scheme in particular creating far too many nightmares for its own good.There are just too many commands to cycle through on the Dual Shock to make this thing any fun. Just about every single button combination you can think of has somehow made its way into the final schematic, and none of them are intuitive. Other than selecting your units and telling them to move somewhere, every other command doesn't make a bit of sense. Why is  they're a button to switch between defensive, offensive, and obedient modes for your soldiers? Do we really need to tell them when to be defensive, offensive, and when to listen to your orders? Shouldn't they defend when attacked, attack when you're near an enemy, and listen to your orders no matter when you give them regardless?    And why are some of the orders laid out as though they were secret codes? Holding R1 and tapping right on the directional pad three times summons your commanders, while following that up with another R1 press and two more right-sided directional taps opens up the order menu to tell those commanders what to do. Overly complicated? You better believe it. To make matters worse, the missing keyboard and mouse support that everyone complained about in the Dreamcast version from 2001, has still been omitted. A remedy to plenty of the game's problems, this simple addition could have made all the difference in the world. But as it stands now, we're left with the same jumbled mess that our former editor Anthony Chau was cursed with late last year.There are other issues we have with the game as well; like the fact that you can't pick and choose the area where you'd like to build your base in any of the maps (it's all automatic with the computer even dictating exactly what type of buildings go where), or that your money is given to you continuously for battle without having to earn it, harvest it, or do anything else other than sit  they're to receive it. The entire gameplay system never really seems to work itself out, and other than the public perception element offers nothing new, innovative, or even standard by way of the RTS genre.GraphicsThe camera options in Conflict Zone are very effective, and offer the type of flexibility one needs when keeping track of all-out war. Zooming in and out, rotating the camera in every direction, and tilting it from a semi-isometric view to top-down are easily manipulated via the two analog sticks with great ease. It was actually a nice change of pace from the complicated controls of character manipulation and helped us to realize how much better the gameplay could have been had it been this easy to maneuver.The character models fare almost as well, but the textures and resolution in which they?re presented are seriously dated. Already considered old-school by way of visuals when it appeared on the Dreamcast at the end of 2001, the blurry, low-detailed structures and vehicles give the distinct impression of a late-generation PlayStation One game, with insect-like people whose only determining difference being the color of their helmets taking up the majority of the battlefield.At least the cut scene cinemas are nicely presented (if not seriously compressed) and provide a humorous if not dark glimpse into the practice that is war. Mostly told from a reporters-eye view, the various intermissions have their share of comedy, tragedy, and realism, and help to do their part in making the world of Conflict Zone believable and unique.SoundDisappointing for sure, the voice-over work is sparse and obviously trying to rip off the tone already established by RTS legend, Command & Conquer; the difference being how mechanical the majority of these personalities sound (the tutorial voice we can excuse, the rest of them however are another story entirely). Similarly, the musical score is rather repetitive and sometimes far too obvious for its own good, while the audio effects meddle in obscurity with their mediocre impact. Conflict Zone is definitely not the type of game that will give your receiver (or television for that matter) a workout.Conflict Zone was one of the last third-party Dreamcast games that we saw for the now-dead system, and hasn't offered one iota of improvement for the PlayStation 2 incarnation. Technically flawed in a myriad of ways and far less superior to just about any RTS on the market, Ubi Soft's PC turned DC to PS2 effort is an unfortunate waste of time. Clever media-manipulation idea aside, this particular French-born strat-game has managed to pull off a feat previously thought impossible --it's promoted 3DO's somewhat average attempt at the genre known as Army Men to the preferred choice on the PS2's list of RTS possibilities; an impressive accomplishment to be sure.", "date": "Nov 26, 2002"}
