And like Star Wars, the Lord of the Rings is a hot license.  EA scored big by snatching the movie license, and while we don't get an official Fellowship of the Ring game from EA, Xbox owners can enjoy Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  For those hoping for RPG and/or adventure elements, you'll be greatly disappointed.  The Two Towers is a straight-on beat-em-up.  And while the PS2 version sported some stunning graphics, The Two Towers doesn't look up to par on Xbox.  Simply put, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a nice little snack, but it won't satisfy those looking for a four-course meal.  Features Thirteen levels showing off the darkest sides of Middle Earth Play as Aragorn, Gimli, or Legolas Upgrade your characters with new combos Exclusive interviews with the stars of the film Dolby Digital 5.1  Gameplay Originally released on PS2 in October, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers tells the tale of the first two movies.  So while you don't officially get to enjoy a separate Fellowship of the Ring game, gamers can still explore the mines of Moria before taking on the battle at Helms Deep.    The first time you slip The Two Towers into your Xbox can be a bit disconcerting.  There's no menu.  The game simply begins with a long intro using clips from the movie.  You are then brought into the game to fight the evil orc hordes as Isildur.  This is the training level and the basic commands will flash on screen.  The controls are quite simple, though, and you'll be hacking and slashing away before the next cut-scene.  Your attacks are pretty basic, with new combos available for purchase between levels.  You earn points by performing combos and varying your attacks on enemies.  X parries (you can even block incoming arrows), A offers a speed attack, Y a power attack, and B a knock-down attack.  The Left Trigger has you whip out your bow (Gimli wields a throwing axe), and A shoots an arrow (or throws an axe).  The Right Trigger is for a powerful stroke at a downed enemy.  The black button has you hop backwards, a good way to avoid an attack, though it would have been nice if you could just push down on the thumbstick for this, because as we all know, the black button isn't the easiest thing to reach quickly.  There's no controller mapping functionality whatsoever, so you're stuck with the controls you're given from the get-go.    Fights are quite easy to master, with a lot of button mashing and simple combos.  Parrying becomes essential, especially when you're being targeted by archers.  The battle system is pretty simplistic, which is the norm for most straight action games.  A system with more depth, where parrying might leave enemies open for attacks, would have added a longer shelf-life to the Two Towers, but overall the game does a good job of offering endless (and mindless) action set in the wonderful world of Middle Earth.  Though you begin your adventure as Isildor, you play most of the game as either Legolas, Gimli, or Aragorn.  You can choose one of the three at the start of each level.  Most of the time the other characters will accompany you in a supporting role.  Each character is quite different from one another with Gimli offering plenty of might, Legolas far best at long range, and Aragorn as the perfect balance between the two.  As you play, you'll level up your character.  This makes it most sensible to play through the game three times, once as each character.  This way you can have Aragorn, for example, at his mightiest when facing the attack on Helm's Deep.  If you hop around with each character, you'll end up with three characters too outmatched for the final battle.  But that's not a problem.  In fact, anyone who makes it through the first time will likely play through The Two Towers twice more.  The game is short, offering five to six hours of gameplay for each pass through, but is enjoyable enough to hope through two more times.  The Two Towers does a nice job of mixing movie elements with gameplay.  While some may not like seeing movie snippets cut between animated cut-scenes, I think it's a great implementation of the license.  If anything, it would have been nice to see the movie scenes used a bit more to do a better job of telling the story of the first two movies.  While those playing the game will likely have seen both movies, it wouldn't have hurt a bit to do more than twenty-second slices.  But then, since The Two Towers is only concerned with action, action, action, there's no real need for a lot of story.  That's something often left to RPGs and adventure games.      On the positive side, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers sets out to be a senseless beat-em-up reminiscent of classic side-scrolling games of yore.  In that, EA succeeds.  The Two Towers is a great, action-packed button-mashing fest.  And it does so with one of the biggest licenses out there.  This is your first chance to slice up orcs with Gimli's axe or fell Uruk-Hai with Legolas' bow.  I promise if you are a Tolkien fan, you'll love it.  The Two Towers does exactly what it sets out to do -- it's an action game doing a good job using a license that will easily appeal to the mainstream.  But while The Two Towers is fun, it's not really one of the better action games around.  It does nothing new and there are a lot of problems that detract from the experience.  The controls for The Two Towers is great.  Easy to use and pick up with a combo system that couldn't be simpler to master.  But the fixed camera is quite bad and there are plenty of moments where you will get hit by creatures off-screen.  The most annoying is getting hit with arrows when you're to the extreme left or right of the screen, when you can't even see the incoming arrows.  There are also unfair moments where you can be knocked to the ground and then hit constantly while trying to get up.  Each time you start to rise, you get swatted down again before you have control of the character and can jump back or parry.  This little death loop will get you killed quickly.  While most action games are on a track, The Two Towers seems to be on a shorter leash than most.  You have very little roaming room.  In fact, you are often confined to moving forward and back with little lateral movement.  Okay, I can deal.  Heck, I've probably played through Streets of Rage 2 a hundred times.  What makes this really annoying, however, is that there are invisible walls that stop your movement.  You may be, for example, in a swamp and while the only thing around you is black marsh, you won't be able to move through the entire area.  You just suddenly stop.  Why can't you at least move around the entire screen?  There's no reason for it at all.  As the game follows the two movies closely, you'll get a chance to face off against all the bosses found in the major motion picture.  But a lot of these bosses are broken down to incredibly simple patterns and there is almost always only one way to take them down.  They aren't bad, but there's a fluidity found in great games that's missing throughout The Two Towers.  Like I said earlier, The Two Towers is intended to be an action-only game.  But it's hard not to notice how much more it could have been.  This is a game screaming for squad-based combat.  Take control of Legolas, sure, but let me be able to tell Aragorn to focus on this creature, or to keep back, or to defend.  Instead it feels less like a group and more like a one-man show with other characters randomly attacking when it suits them.  And though you will see Gandalf fight in certain areas or see a battle in which Frodo hops around trying to avoid being hit, they are merely animated scenery, with no real consequence in helping your fight.      EA is likely saving Gandalf for the next game, but I'm not reviewing some future product.  Why can't I play as Gandalf now?  Who wouldn't want to take a hand in playing him?  At least it makes sense to have Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas as the chosen characters, since they are the primary muscle through the trilogy and remain grouped in the second movie.   In the end, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers offers enough, but not more.  Which is why it should be viewed as a good game, but not a great one.  Graphics When I first saw The Two Towers on PS2, I was impressed and eager to see how much better it would look on Xbox.  Unfortunately, something's been lost in the port, because the Xbox version is inferior to the sharp and stunning quality of what was found on PS2.  In fact, the Xbox version, visually, is hardly the one that will rule them all.  There's a ton of texture problems, poor contrast, and less detail than what's found on the PS2.  That's not acceptable for a game coming out two months later and on a system that is easier to program for and can churn out incredible graphics with little effort.  The Xbox version boasts a solid framerate, but beyond that, it's not terribly attractive.  There are nice uses of lighting, good animations, and nice character models.  But the faces, oh, the poor, ugly recreations of Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, and even Aragorn.  None of them look good and the majority of cut-scenes look less-attractive than the in-game action.  The Two Towers looks decent, but in a few months it will look incredibly outdated in terms of visuals.  If only more effort and care were taken in porting the PS2 version, this could have been a real stunner.    Sound It's hard to go wrong when you can use the music and fine voice-acting from the first two films.  Yet, it does go wrong. There's a noticeable difference between the sound in the movie cut-scenes and throughout the rest of the game.  Though 5.1 Dolby Digital is supported throughout, little effort was taken in making certain the 5.1 was managed properly.  The center-channel is used for voices and you do get to hear the battle surrouding you, but it all seems quite minute after hearing the thick, rich sound in the movie cut-scenes.    The music comes straight from the movies as does almost all of the dialogue.  That's fine, because anyone buying this game is going to want to re-experience the movies anyway.  There really isn't a need for new voice-overs or lots of unique music.  Just as long as it's handled well.  But the big problem here is that a lot of the score doesn't stream properly.  So you'll get abrupt pauses as it recycles and random hiccups.  At least it's in Dolby Digital. A couple of months ago, EA released Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers on PS2.  The game looked stunning on Sony's console and I couldn't wait for the port over to Xbox.  Having heard so many good things, I expected a lot from The Two Towers, but I'm somewhat disappointed in this decent beat-em-up, which comes with far too many limitations and nagging annoyances to be worthy of quite such high praise that's been thrown around.  It's good, it's fun, and if you enjoyed the first two Lord of the Rings movies, you'll probably dig it.  But The Two Towers is more a case of ~Oh wow, they made a decent licensed game~ than ~it's innovative and fantastic to play.~  Buying the Xbox version gets you nothing extra except better sound.  The graphics aren't even improved and on Xbox, they look a little weak.  If you've got extra holiday cash, you may wanna check this one out, but don't go selling off your copy of Splinter Cell in hopes for something better.  The Two Towers is good, but not great.", "date": "Jan 3, 2003"}
