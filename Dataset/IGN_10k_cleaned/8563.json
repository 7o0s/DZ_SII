It's a show known for its crude and often disgusting humor, some of the most offensive of which is conveyed through its show-within-a-show, ~Terrance & Phillip.~ The characters of Terrance and Phillip are a comedy duo, two overly flatulent actors from Canada whose television show is centered entirely on fart jokes. It's the closest comparison to J.J. & Jeff we've got in the States.   The story of J.J. & Jeff is an odd one, but it goes like this -- it's the localized 1990 American TurboGrafx version of a Japanese PC Engine game based on a then-popular Japanese TV show called Kato & Ken. Kato & Ken were, like today's Terrance & Phillip, a comedy duo who focused almost exclusively on toilet humor. Their show was a hit in the late '80s and early '90s. It made sense, then, that Japan got a game using the Kato & Ken license, and that it featured the same off-beat brand of potty-based jokes. It didn't make sense when the game came to America, where its license was unknown and where its content was heavily edited and censored.           J.J. & Jeff are the English names given to the altered main character pair, racially transformed from Japanese pop culture icons to generic American detectives.  The two men find themselves hired to rescue a kidnapped millionaire, and set off on a side-scrolling platformer adventure to do so. Players can choose to control either J.J. or Jeff, but there's no difference in control between the two because both control poorly.   The gameplay reveals itself immediately as a badly-conceived clone of Adventure Island, right down to the one-hit-kill random bonfires and trip-you-up boulders you'll be tasked to clear with flying leaps. The characters' jumps feel floaty, though, making simple platforming a hassle -- and there's no break elsewhere in the control scheme, as both men are additionally crippled with severely limited attack power.   You can jump on baddies, Mario-style, but direct attack commands are restricted to a short range forward kick and a slow-moving burst from an aerosol spray can. The kick attack seems to be only useful for interacting with the environment, as randomly kicking objects and doors can reveal hidden items like coins and fruit. The spray can assault is nonsensical, but exists only because the original Japanese graphic was altered; in Japan's Kato & Ken version, the heroes squatted down, turned backwards and farted to produce the same cloud of drifting, noxious fumes.This is a case of a poor, boring game with one redeeming aspect being translated, altered and watered down into an even poorer, more boring game with no redeeming qualities. Kato & Ken was a vanilla platformer in Japan, but at least it had its humor and the tie-in with a popular TV license back in 1990. But stripped of that association, what results is an even more vanilla, humorless game that just doesn't make any sense at all, and certainly isn't funny. Stay away from J.J. & Jeff -- if you're looking for a TurboGrafx platformer, there are far better options for you to consider. Plus, if you're looking for fart jokes and potty humor, South Park reruns are readily available for free.", "date": "May 31, 2007"}
