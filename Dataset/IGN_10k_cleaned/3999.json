There's just too much going on for someone who's not absolutely dedicated to reading a 400 page manual to learn. Take any of your modern jet fighter sims--there's umpteen keyboard commands to learn, complex aerial maneuvers, dials and gauges spinning willy-nilly, and if you do manage to get off the ground and start flying around, some bozo will lock a missile on you from miles away.  Fortunately tank games aren't as complex, since your treads are firmly planted in the ground and don't really have to deal with too many maneuvers. World War II tanks are even simpler than modern units--drive around, use the radio, and shoot the enemy. No complex electronic countermeasures here.  SSI used this natural simplicity to make Panzer Commander an accessible, easy-to-learn game, suitable for even the novice sim fan -- one who is ready to move onto something more realistic but is a bit leery of the aforesaid jet titles. The game is very easy to play, with but a few keys for movement, some for the different views, some orders for the two other tanks in your platoon, and that's about it.  Yet while easy to play, it is not easy to win. Your briefings before each mission are cursory at best, and most of the time downright vague. Basically, you're told to go forward, hit a few waypoints, and if you're lucky, you'll survive. Add the fact that your crew chatters at you in either German or Russian, and you'll realize you're pretty much on your own as far as acquiring information.  When some unseen tank or artillery barrage suddenly hits your tank, you return to a screen that really doesn't deserve the name debriefing screen. You'll never know who hit you, how it happened, or how you're going to avoid it next time. You simply have to play again and hope for the best.  The battlefield is large and expansive, but due to the inflexible waypointing incorporated into the scenarios, it almost becomes a kind of rail shooter--go here, kill everyone, go here. There's also no real infantry presence apart from bunkers and armored cars, which is not unusual in tank game, but one wonders, with 3D cards the way they are now, if an attempt might not be made soon.  In the end, Panzer Commander is an enjoyable if extremely challenging blast through some ho-hum terrain graphics and some sharp looking tank models. While it is certainly not the last word in World War II tank simulations it is reasonably entertaining to warrant a recommendation. -- Jason Bates", "date": "Aug 14, 1998"}
