The action game hero has been wowing vidders since the NES, and now you can take his boom-boom to go, thanks to Hudson's excellent port of the classic game.  Features:  Power-ups Multiple boards Escalating difficulty  When you think of it, Bomberman is the perfect mobile game. The static screen action couple with simple, engaging game play makes it a natural for either a five-minute diversion in a busy terminal, or a cool down after late night studying.  For those who officially came out from under the rock, Bomberman is a little fella that, well, drops bombs. He's stuck in a series of mazes, often populated by an assortment of nasties. Bomberman must use his bombs to blast his way through the maze and take out the bad guys. Along the way, he'll discover power-up that give his bombs some extra boom. And when he finishes one maze, it's on to the next.  Bomberman was born of an era when games were limited by tech, so programmers had to be especially clever in crafting devious, addictive game play to rope gamers in. This is why the game is such a success on wireless devices. Cellphones are hardly renowned for their graphical prowess, so developers need to create games that don't need visual sparkle to be fun.  Bomberman is cut from the mold of earlier titles. There are fewer poer-ups than later titles. Mainly, you'll be uncovering extra bombs so you can lay down more tan one boom-ball at a time. Flame power-ups increase the volatility of your bombs. He bigger the blast radius, the more damage you can do to the maze or enemies. Of course, that also means little Bomberman needs to scoot far away unless he wants to be singed in the blast. There are remote-detonation bombs, perfect for trapping bad guys, and extreme bombs that will light up an entire line.  The only thing we could wish for more out of a wireless Bomberman is online play. Linking up four people might not be terribly easy, but one-on-one game play would be something special. Bomberman is widely considered one of the best party games ever -- if you've ever piled on a couch with several friends and fired up Bomberman, you know that later-day party games like Mario Party don't even come close.Bomberman is how I really wanted to start 204 with wireless gaming. It's an excellent little title that compensates for any tech limitations with fiendishly addictive, simple game play. Even though I own many, many versions of Bomberman, I found myself sitting on my couch, playing the mobile version for a good half-hour before I realized where the time went. Hudson has a rich catalog -- hopefully other old faves are on the way, such as Bonk or Adventure Island.", "date": "Jan 2, 2004"}
