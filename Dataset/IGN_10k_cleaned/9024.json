With High School Musical 2 pulling in over 17 million viewers this summer, making it the biggest thing on cable, and soundtrack albums flying out of your local Wal-Mart, somebody decided there needed to be a mobile game to support the marketing onslaught. That somebody likely gave developer Universomo eighty dollars and a weekend deadline to both start and finish the mobile High School Musical, because this non-game is an absolute bore.   There are four events in the game, each using pretty much the exact same mechanics -- press 4, 6, 7, or 9 to match up with some flashing circles on the screen. In singing, you hold the key associated with the circle being pounded by musical notes. Dancing asks you to time those presses to dance in time with a rhythm that hardly even matches the background music. Scholastic Decathlon is a memory-matching game, filing those four circles with math symbols. Finally, basketball is about batting away balls.   And none of those games are worth three seconds of your time, which just happens to be how long it takes to figure out what's going on. However, should you push through the tedium and advance far enough in each event, you unlock details about each cast member in a virtual scrapbook.   The whole thing is just dreadful. The music is repetitive, the visuals are exceedingly bland, and the game play is just not fun. And this isn't me being down on something with a kid-oriented license -- I'm looking forward to the Hannah Montana music game on the DS.Horrible. Avoid. Do not download.
