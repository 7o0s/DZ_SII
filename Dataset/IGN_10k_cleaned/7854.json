Every shot goes in, every pass is crisp and every bounce goes their way. With In The Zone '99, Konami makes several improvements over last year's title but doesn't make it to the higher ground of basketball sims.  The Facts:  Full NBA and NBA Players Association License All new motion captured animations New on-the-fly play-calling system Icon passing system Voice of Chicago Bulls public address announcer Ray Clay Three-point shooting contest   Gameplay For 1999, Konami gives In The Zone a much needed boost in overall game speed that brings the game closer to the smooth back-and-forth action of the NBA. No more players bobbing along with jerky movements that made them look like robots. Now you can actually make quick players like Stephon Marbury and Antonio McDyess slash past their defenders and into the lane for easy baskets. The new icon  passing feature eliminates those frustrating turnovers where you inexplicably throw the ball directly to the other team with the game on the line. This feature does a lot more for gameplay than the new play-calling system. You would think that running real plays would help capture the NBA experience, but in this case it's more of a guessing game as you wait and hope for players to move and screen and cut like they're supposed to. Your actually better off playing it like a pick up game of basketball where your five guys sort of just move around randomly until someone gets an open shot. As improved as ITZ '99 is at the offensive end of the court, it's the defensive AI that will cause you to lose games. Finding a way to stop opposing scorers without fouling can be very frustrating. As smart and methodical as the Utah Jazz are, there is no way Jeff Hornacek should score 70 points in a game... ever... against anyone.  Graphics This is an area where ITZ '99 is an improvement over '98, but is still short of the standard set by NBA Courtside or NBA Live '99. Eyestrain will be significantly reduced thanks to In The Zone '99's crisper graphics. The bluriness isn't a problem anymore but the uniforms can still look a little jumbled, there is still little detail on the player faces and while smoother than their predecessors , players still look a little blocky. The bright primary colors and neon-sign inspired game text still give ITZ '99 a Super NES look to it.  Sound  Konami continued with strong audio components for ITZ '99. Chicago Bulls announcer Ray Clay is a definite strong point for the game. Clay has been the voice of the Bulls in the '90s and should sound familiar to most gamers. His realistic timing and enthusiasm when he calls player names and scores add a big dose of realism to the game. In fact, the only voice fans usually hear at NBA arenas is the P.A. announcer, not the TV guys. The music is typically irritating but it will not make you want to shoot yourself. In The Zone '99 is indeed an improvement over the 1998 version , but on its own it's still a mediocre basketball simulator. Konami did throw in a few gimmicks like a surprisingly entertaining three-point shootout mode and a create-a-player feature that allows you to control every detail down to location of wristbands and knee braces and hi vs. low socks. But inaccuracies like Scottie Pippen still playing for the Bulls [he never suited up for them in 1999] and Glen Rice still on the Hornets [He's wearing a Lakers uniform on the box art for crying out loud!!!] leave you scratching your head. But perhaps the most outstanding inconsistency is between the regular gameplay and the automatic replay mode after big plays. For lack of a better phrase it's like looking at two different games. The replay runs in hi-res and looks as good as Courtside. It only last for 4 seconds but it is disappointing to go back to regular game play with its choppy edges.", "date": "Apr 20, 1999"}
