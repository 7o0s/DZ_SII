You already know it's the standard for licensed big league sports games in general and football in particular. But since they want another $50 out of each and every member of the game buying public this fall, EA has gone to great lengths to offer up more customization options than ever before and new game modes designed to enhance your enjoyment of the rock solid football engine.   Gameplay  In a nutshell the X's and O's of Madden 2003's football engine are the same as last year's version with a few new audible and line of scrimmage play calling elements. Receiver hot routes now include an outside slant and a post pattern, while on defense you can shift the defensive line, linebackers and defensive backs as whole units. Other than that you'll notice a few new animations for the same old running, passing and tackling you've come to expect from Tiburon's football engine.   The customization options in Madden run so deep now that you can end building and playing a game almost entirely of your own creation. The Create-a-Playbook is one of the deepest and can be the most time consuming element of the game since it also includes the Create-a-Formation feature. Using NFL rules that require a certain number of players in the backfield and on the line of scrimmage, you can more or less come up with any formation you can imagine. An NFL version of college football's full house backfield or some crazy five wideout bunch formation are well within reach. From your custom or standard NFL formation you can then literally determine every step every player on your team will make on either offense or defense. In creating a passing play (which really the whole point of a custom playbook right?) you have the freedom draw the route you want a receiver to take rather than selecting from a list of plays like the post, fly, hook etc. The most helpful part of the Create-a-Playbook feature is the instant test run, where you can see if your mad creation is even legal and then check to see how effective it is against a defense. It's basically a quick access to the game's practice mode but it's intuitive placement in the playbook creator makes a huge difference.  In fact, at this stage of Madden's development as a franchise, the synergy between it's different game modes and features is probably the part of the game that impressed me the most. Whether it's the test run in the playbook editor or importing your Franchise mode team into exhibition play, Madden NFL 2003 does a good job of putting things together in a way that makes sense.   The Franchise Mode itself has undergone a few adjustments as well to more accurately capture the essence of the NFL. Even though it will only apply in the first season, pre-existing injuries to players will now reflect the NFL as it stands in the summer of 2002. Players like Raiders defensive lineman Regan Upshaw who are injured coming into the season and expected to miss significant regular season time will be included on the team's roster but they'll  have ratings that reflect their injured status. If the injury is keeping them out for the season, they'll be good to go in the next franchise year. This will make Madden's final rosters super important for all you wannabe General Managers out there.   Player progression in the preseason adds another dose of NFL reality and gives you a chance to upgrade your younger players a point or two. You can even sim the preseason and get some better attribute points for your younger players as long as you sub them into starting roles. This is especially helpful deep into Franchise mode when you use the new scouting combine to get info on rookies coming into the draft. You're given workout numbers for the 40 yard dash, bench press, vertical jump, etc for free, but scouting gives you information about the hands of a receiver or the footwork of a lineman for example. Come draft day, you'll only have in depth info on the players you scouted and just the workout numbers on every one else. This creates a nice element of strategy since you have to first determine your team needs and then try to project what players are going to be available to you when you draft. You don't want to waste scouting points on players who are either going to be drafted before you pick or way down the road.   The extremely serious Madden fans will love the fact that you can now customize any jersey number to any player on your franchise team. Donovan McNabb can wear #94 if you want him to or you can assign #34 to that new rookie kicker of yours.   Madden's extra game modes offer that much more depth to the game, but also give you skills that can be applied to the main focus of the game: real NFL football. Football 101 is designed to teach gamers who don't know Madden or don't know football what videogame football is all about. It works similar to practice mode where you select a play and Madden's voiceover describes how it's supposed to be run and what makes it effective. Then you get a chance to run it yourself and earn tokens each time you run it successfully. The tokens are used to buy Madden cards.     Gameplay Cont.  Minicamp mode takes you to different NFL cities to learn the individual skills you'll need to be a good Madden player. You run timed drills in a specific task like punting or run stopping where you only get to control the relevant player like the punter or middle linebacker. When you run a minicamp drill you control the players of whatever NFL city is holding that minicamp. For the precision passing drill you control the QB and receivers of the Kansas City Chiefs on rookie difficulty but precision passing on Pro difficulty is in Oakland and is significantly more difficult. Once you run the drill well enough to earn at least a bronze medal you unlock the game situation tied to that drill. This is a simulated game situation where you have to protect a lead or take the lead  using the specific skill you just learned in the drill. After you master defensive line moves drill your game situation will be to protect Philadelphia's one point lead over the Giants or somebody with only 55 second remaining in the fourth quarter using only the Eagle defensive linemen. You can still call the defenses that you want but you can't take control of any linebackers or DBs. You're challenge is to control the remainder of the game using only D-linemen to put pressure on the quarterback. Completing the game situation unlocks a Madden Card for the team you used in the drill. The skills that you refine in the Minicamp mode, especially on the All-Pro and All Madden difficulties will give you no choice but to become a better Madden player. This game mode is anything but fluff, as it more or less improves on the 2 Minute Drill that was introduced last year.   Graphics  Like all of its other improvements Madden 2003's visual enchancements are subtle but will definitely be appreciated by longtime fans. The players have fingers now. They had fingers previous editions but you'll notice a significant number of realistic hand gestures in Madden 2003 during player cutaways and close ups. The crowds that fill NFL stadiums in this game are outstanding. The same frantic waving and shimmering crowds we saw in 2002 FIFA World Cup have been improved and brought over to the big football franchise. The happy football fans wear team colors, just not head to toe like the soccer nuts in FIFA World Cup, so it looks very much like an American football crowd. Plus the field textures look more like grass than in previous editions of Madden. Granted, the scale is a little off because in real life you wouldn't be able to see individual blades of grass if you hovering 50 ft above the field (like Madden's default camera) unless they were giant footlong mutant blades of grass. But the grass is certainly worthwhile.   The new animations and enhanced speed of the game make a big difference. The gang tackling animation is the most significant new animation, but doesn't happen as often as you'd think, just like in the NFL. It's rare that a ball carrier is inept enough to allow four or five defenders to gather around him long enough for everybody to get a piece of his sorry hide. The inclusion of what the team at Tiburon calls ~defensive strafing~ should help those gamers who are sick and tired of controlling defensive backs who only want to run around near the play but never want to make the play. By squeezing the right trigger you'll force whatever defensive player you're controlling to look back towards the line of scrimmage but without losing all of his momentum in whatever direction you have him running. A DB sprinting down the sideline trying to keep with Randy Moss can now turn back and be in a position to make a play on the ball using the left trigger rather than hoping he stays close enough to have the ball hit him in the back of the hands or helmet when you press jump. Pivoting around to see the ball and make a play is NFL football, having the ball hit your player in the back of the head on defense is not.  Sound  The best thing to happen to Madden fans was Big John's move to Monday Night Football. It meant we could finally have some new commentary Madden himself along with Al Michaels, the best football play-by-play man in the business and a man who isn't Pat Summerall. You'll still recognize some of John Madden's lines, but the new inflections and tones freshen things up considerably. Michaels himself is just so good that even when he says something lame, it's really not that lame because he delivers his lines with such authority. Two years of keeping Dennis Miller in check will do that to you. The inevitable repetition is a bit easier to stomach because at least it's not the same drivel you heard the year before and the year before that.   The true surround sound on Xbox and simulated surround sound on PS2 and GameCube are all well done and put you right on the field in the middle of the action. The boos and cheers of that frantic crowd  surrounding you only make them seem more alive. The clean bass on the Xbox version gives those tackles and big hits the thump you know those players must hear when they're giving and receiving them.I was actually surprised at the number of little enhancements Madden NFL 2003 has over its predecessor. It seems that the overall improvement in this game is greater than the sum of its parts. The way every other game mode is meant to refocus your attention on the sound NFL gameplay adds subtle depth without ever letting us get away from the fact that this franchise is all about one thing: NFL realism. From the television style presentation to the cheerleader show at halftime, the polish and substance of  Madden NFL 2003 proves once again why it's the standard that every other NBA, NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball game by every company (including EA) wants to live up to. I can honestly say that there could very well be football games that are more fun than Madden, but you won't find one that has more authenticity from top to bottom. Madden NFL 2003 is a can't miss because it accurately simulates NFL gameplay, NFL commentary, NFL uniforms, NFL stadiums and NFL players and that's what football gamers are looking for. If you hate football, then steer clear of this one. Everybody else, dust off those Hank Williams records and get rowdy like it's Monday Night every night.", "date": "Aug 8, 2002"}
