That game did nearly everything wrong for both a license and kart racing game. Now a different pit crew has taken on the job of making a Shrek racing game suitable for its fans. The guys over at Torus Games have definitely made a better game, but it's more ogre than it is prince charming.    It's always a good day for some kart racing, and the entire fairytale gang wants in on the action. Everyone has their steed of choice, whether it be horse, bull, flying carpet, or bog beast, and everyone is eagerly awaiting the start of the race. There are a lot of racers to choose from. All the major characters from Shrek 2 are in the game, with a healthy smattering of the minor characters. Some of them, like Pinocchio, make sense, since he was in the movie. Others however fit in considerably less. Little Red Riding Hood is an unlockable character, riding atop a rather fierce looking wolf. Great, except Red isn't even really in the movie. The Big Bad Wolf is however, and this monstrous beast wolf looks nothing like the humorous crossdressing wolf featured in both films. The movies have some great minor characters, so it's a shame that the developers just stuck in some random ones to fill out the roster.    Supposedly each racer has different stats, though it's impossible to tell without racing them. The character select screen doesn't show any stats for the characters. It doesn't even put them into weight classes or anything. Not that it really matters, as people would want to pick their favorite character anyway. Players hoping to see their favorite character in the race are going to be a little disappointed though. The racers are so small, that the ~vehicles~ are all that is really visible. For some of them it's nearly impossible to tell who the racer is just from watching the game. It's a major drawback when the game featuring famous licensed characters has them too small to see.    Unlike the last Shrek racing game, Shrek: Smash 'n Crash is an isometric view, similar to Racing Gears advance. Players race around the tracks, collecting item barrels and using the powerups against their opponents. It's pretty basic kart racing affair. The races are hectic in large part due to the narrow courses and plethora of powerups. When players run over a barrel, they receive one of ten powerups. Sounds like a lot at first, but there are three items that are essentially just a bomb. And two items that are homing missiles. Plus the obligatory shield, speed-booster, and opponent speed-decreaser. With all these weapons, players can expect to be crashing, a lot. The races quickly degrade into a string of cheap shots, and oftentimes winning is based solely on luck, instead of any real skill. The lack of a map makes it difficult to play any of the tracks the first time, especially since the arrows warning of upcoming turns sometimes come almost too late. The races feel like the character is stumbling clumsily through the course, and lack a real racing feel. Perhaps that is what the developer was going for, but it doesn't work very well and it makes some of the tracks are very annoying to play.       Luckily, there are a ton of tracks in the game, and a variety of ways to play them. Most of the tracks (and characters) get unlocked in either the Cup Challenge or Tournament. The Cup Challenge has players compete in three races, with points awarded for how well they finish. The Tournament works in the same way, but with 18 races, instead of three. The Tournament mode is great if players like the game, but for a handheld, it's a bit much. Players can't stop mid-tournament without losing their progress, and it's too long to be completed on, say, the bus ride to school. Thankfully, a Quick Race and a Time Trial mode are also included for players that just want a quick round, or to race without the distraction of competition.    The biggest drawback in Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing is the lack of any multiplayer. Racing games are fun to play with friends, and even a mediocre one can be made better when it's played with peers. Seriously, who plays a kart (or bog beast) racer by themselves? Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing is barely recognizable as a Shrek game. If someone were to watch the game in progress, there is no way they would know who was on screen. The game is pretty fast paced, and offers a variety of racing options, but the main part of the game is a bit awkward and feels very clumsy. Smash n' Crash may be the best Shrek racing game on the GBA, but it's still just a mediocre one.", "date": "Dec 14, 2006"}
