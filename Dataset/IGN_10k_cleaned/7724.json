His  first appearance was on the NES, where the basics that would define his  series were established. But Bomberman truly matured when Hudson, the  company that created him, debuted its own video game hardware - the  TurboGrafx-16.  An early release for the system, simply called ~Bomberman,~ reimagined the  character with the short, out-of-proportion design with the white bucket  helmet that we recognize today. It was a radical departure from the first  attempts to display the character in artwork - he'd previously always been  depicted as a kind of blue-suited Samus Aran (even though the in-game  graphics of the NES title looked much closer to the ~new~ art style).  Cuteness worked where realism didn't, and from 1990 on the B-Man has (with one  unfortunate exception) been kept in stylized anime form.  This Virtual Console release isn't the first Bomberman game from the NES.  It's also not the first Bomberman game from the TurboGrafx. This release, Bomberman '93,  was the follow-up to those titles. It came to the TG16 in, of course, 1993,  and brought with it the classic multiplayer blasting design that you've  probably had the opportunity to play several times before.  You and up to four friends are thrown into a square-shaped arena filled with  obstacles. You have the power to lay bombs at your feet, that, after a few  seconds, explode into horizontal and vertical lines of flame. The object of  the game is to be the last Bomberman standing, clearing enough of the  obstacles out of the way with your own bombs to get into range of your  friends, then trapping them in a corner, laying another explosive, and  kissing them goodbye.  The simple battle-royale formula was so successful in its first few outings  that even modern Bomberman releases do little to change it, and are scorned  if they try. It's one of the best and most classic multiplayer contests  gaming has to offer - it's nice to see it debuting here with the Wii.  The game supports up to five players, though the process to get the fifth  human on board is confusing. The Wii can only handle four Wiimotes and/or  Classic Controllers at a time, which means you need at least one GameCube  Controller plugged in. As you select Bomberman's channel from your Wii  dashboard, you need to hold down the R Button on each Cube Controller you  want to use - doing so will boot the game into a controller assignment  screen before the opening cinematic plays.  You can use any combination of Wiimotes and Cube Controllers, so even if you  only have the one Remote that shipped with your system you can probably  gather up four last-gen corded pads (or better yet, Wavebirds) to outfit a  full force of five.  Besides the classic multiplayer mode, Bomberman '93 hosts a lengthy  single-player adventure. Over 50 levels take you through a variety of  worlds, where the gameplay focus is on eliminating all of the enemies in a  room and then finding the hidden exit portal before time runs out. A boss  battle comes at the end of every planet, as Bomberman blasts around his  solar system on the trail of his dark and evil twin.Hudson chose wisely in selecting Bomberman '93 as one of its first Virtual Console titles. It supports the multiplayer, party-gaming focus that the Wii is designed to inspire, and even goes one better by letting a fifth player get in on the fun. The single player mode is still fun and challenging, a great representation of Bomberman's early days. All that for just one dollar more than an NES download  it's a great value.", "date": "Dec 2, 2006"}
