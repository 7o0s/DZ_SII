{"name": "Dragon's Lair", "name_review": "Dragon's Lair", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/12/10/dragons-lair", "text": "While the term ~classic arcade game~ is bandied about repeatedly, the actual list of games that deserve the hallowed mantle is relatively short. Pac-Man. Space Invaders. And, of course, Dragon's Lair. The laser disc game ushered in the idea of the interactive movie -- and in many respects, DL is one of the very rare members of the genre that managed to deliver the goods. (Mad Dog and Firefox, not so much.)   And now, the cabinet that I dumped dozens upon dozens of quarters into has been shrunk down into a pocket-sized cellphone game. In one sense, I'm absolutely astounded, because the game successfully captures the feeling of classic. The music, the famous death scene, the dragon -- it's all in here. However, the feeling of Dragon's Lair isn't necessarily going to be enough for some fans. The sprites that replace the hand-drawn and animated characters (pasted over good scans of the original background art) make the game seem paler than what it once was -- and is, if you ever hunt down a still-standing coin-op.   The sequences within the game are straight out of the original coin-op, such as the crypt keeps and the slime monsters. The action within them is controlled by the thumb pad and action key, with the player of necessarily moving Dirk directly, but more ~guiding~ him to safety by hitting a predetermined set of directional commands. Memorize and deploy the right commands in the correct order, and Dirk survives the scene. He never collects gold or power ups his sword -- he simply makes it to the next scene alive.    If you do have the gift of memorization -- and the amount of trial-and-error in Dragon's Lair will help you hone your mental skills -- you will see the entirety of the game. The sights are still amusing. And while I complain that the sprites that replace the animated characters don't possess the same charm, they do recreate the action with solid efficiency. I wasn't expecting them to recreate the laser disc-based originals, but I also wasn't expecting to miss them as much as I did.   Dragon's Lair starts out with the original attract voice from the cabinet, booming ~Dragon's Lair!~ as you start the game. The game then settles into some in-game sound effects that sound similar to the original effects, but not quite as good. When crumbling bricks fall on Dirk's head, it sounds more like a MIDI drum solo than stones falling.  Newcomers might not be impressed with Dragon's Lair because it is so straightforward -- they are used to games where the hero is constantly evolving, gaining new powers. Or games where you have 360-degree control over movement. For them, Dragon's Lair will disappoint. But this release isn't for them anyway; this is for the fans, and this fan was certainly satisfied to a degree. The idea of actually squeezing the essence of the great arcade classic into a cellphone is inspiring. But after a while, I stopped being so engaged with the mobile version and wanted just to get in my car and drive down to see my brother, who actually has a working coin-op. However, for those without such fraternal connections, this may be the next best thing.", "date": "Dec 10, 2005"}
