The primitively presented, but nevertheless addictive arcade title couldn't have been simpler: you took control of a frog, maneuvered him through a trafficked street and across a river while avoiding obstacles. Voila. Of course, the process was a lot more difficult than it sounds and as a result gamers lost too many quarters to count trying to become the ultimate Frogger pro in their local arcades.  As arcades gave way to home consoles and next-generation systems were born, Frogger took some time off. But as with any classic franchise, his triumphant return was inevitable. Publisher Konami has been working on a suitable re-entry for Frogger for some years, but the company's updates to the classic formula have thus far fallen a bit off the mark.   Its latest attempt, Frogger: Ancient Shadow, is unfortunately no different. The Hudson Soft-developed title retains the original dodge-and-run play mechanics of its decades-aged ancestor, which is sure to please old-school gamers hungry for a little nostalgia. And speaking of which, the game even includes a competently emulated version of the 1981 classic, which may prove reason enough to warrant a consideration for some. But even so, it's clear from the get-go that Ancient Shadow has been designed with kids in mind, and the title's sometimes clunky, overly complex controls aren't very compatible with such an audience.  The Facts  3D update to the classic arcade hit Frogger Become Frogger and traverse a story mode involving a shadowy enemy Dodge-and-run gameplay mechanics mix with environmental puzzles Jump through seven different worlds with four sub-levels apiece Take part in a host of multiplayer mini-games Multiplayer mode supports up to four players Includes a fully playable version of the 1981 classic arcade game Frogger   It's Jumping Time Frogger is enjoying another relaxing day in the swamp when he's surprised by his girlfriend Lily, who explains that she saw some shadowy figure lurking around the environment. It's up to Frogger to figure out what's going on. And that about sums up the simplistic, straightforward setup for Ancient Shadow. All of this is leveled at you via passable, but unimpressive cinematics that unfold in real-time. Hudson Soft and Konami have at least contracted voice actors to deliver character lines, which helps, and some of the dialogue humorously pokes fun at the fact that you are playing a videogame. For instance, when preparing to set out on his new adventure, Frogger asks Lily if she's going to get kidnapped again. She tells him to hold on a second as she checks over the game script and then says that barring a re-write she should be all right. These types of in-jokes remotely remind us of Rare games like Conker's Bad Fur Day, but Frogger cannot compete with the UK studio's production values.    Ancient Shadow's main offering, the story mode, ultimately delivers you some seven game worlds comprised of four sub-levels apiece. You may only advance to the next area after you've beaten the first and therefore the title moves along at a very linear, but comfortable pace, particularly for kids. Completed levels become available in a challenge mode, which is more or less the same thing with the added condition that you compete against the clock.   The title's control mechanics are immediately jarring because they are so archaic and underdeveloped by today's standards, but they do work once you get used to them.  Frogger is maneuvered exclusively with the D-Pad in tile-based movements. Press up on the D-Pad and he hops one tile up. Press right and he jumps one tile to the right. Disappointingly, the analog stick is completely ignored by the game. However, given that the original Frogger hopped in tile-based spurts, too, we can understand why Konami chose to go this route.       What isn't so clear, on the other hand, is why the developer opted to make the mechanics overly complicated, especially since the title's target audience is likely to skew younger. Frogger can only be turned forward, backward, left and right by tapping on the shoulder buttons, which is tedious, to say the least. Meanwhile, rather than using a single button for jumping, two buttons perform unique jumps -- one leaps forward and the other upward. Frogger is additionally able to perform a super hop by tapping the upward jump button twice. And on top of everything else, he can use his tongue to grab onto or move objects. These forced controls do not mix well with some of the game's challenges, which require twitch reactions, and sometimes because of that you'll find yourself tackling a task again -- not because the objective was difficult, but because the controls were unintuitive.   Frogger's abilities work hand-in-hand with the environments, creating a mix of satisfying and frustrating puzzles. In some cases, Hudson Soft has developed some smart and rewarding obstacles that challenge you to perform tile-based jumps, use Frogger's tongue to move an object, transport an item, or eventually activate a lever to progress. It's during these moments that Ancient Shadow is at its best, and thankfully these are commonplace. On top of everything else, Hudson Soft's selection of levels present wide assortments of different hurdles, from varying enemy types to avoid to platform hopping, secret passageways, and more, and progressing through everything can be enjoyable.  In contrast, the game also employs the frustrating die-and-retry gameplay philosophy of old, which means that you will oftentimes have no way of knowing what to do in a situation until after you have first fallen victim to its circumstances. For example, you might jump onto a platform, it will crumble and Frogger will fall into the water (and die, despite the fact that he's a frog). As a result, you will notice yourself playing through levels tens of times, which can be a cumbersome process.   Ancient World could certainly be a longer game. It does feature some 28 worlds, which on paper seems like a lot, but in practice some of the levels can be beaten in a matter of minutes, especially once you know where the traps are and what to avoid. Hudson Soft has at least given Frogger fans some incentive to keep playing, though. The title includes a nicely emulated version of the 1981 arcade classic Frogger, which plays, looks and sounds exactly as it should. Veterans will be pleased to know that while the game may be old, it still holds up and remains as addicting as it was nearly 25 years ago.   Finally, the game features a multitude of multiplayer modes, some of which are available from the start and others that become unlocked as you advance through the story mode. The multiplayer games feel much more like mini-games from a title like Mario Party, meaning that they are shallow and quickly mastered, but good enough in short bursts with friends. There's an option to alternatively play against computer-controlled characters, but we wouldn't recommend it.  Ancient Shadow looks and sounds the part of a Frogger game. The title features stylized, colorful graphics and some little extras that go a long way. Frogger runs through texturally lacking, but still varied greenery and desert locales, and you'll be able to see particles floating in the air, leaves swaying, ripples in water and fish swimming beneath. Characters and objects are low-polygon in nature and animation is light on fluidity, but the visuals get the job done. There are only a couple of unfortunate points throughout the quest where the framerate hiccups for inexcusable reasons. The title does not run in progressive scan or 16x9 widescreen modes, but does at least support Dolby Pro Logic II.  The GameCube version of Frogger: Ancient Shadow works hand-in-hand with the DS one. You can link the systems to unlock hidden content in the GCN build. It's nice to see a developer making use of the feature, but we honestly doubt most people will bother to try it out.Frogger: Ancient Shadow arrives as a smack-in-the-middle average update to the classic dodge-and-run game of old. Developer Hudson Soft seems to have the right idea. There are some smart environmental puzzles in the title and with 28 levels and a multiplayer mode to boot, there are also some reasons to keep playing. But the control mechanics in the title, initially jarring and overly complicated, aren't likely to mesh well with younger players, and the die-and-retry level design can be tedious. As a result, Ancient Shadow is fun and rewarding at times and cumbersome at others. There is some undisputed good news, though: the game ships with a competently emulated version of the 1981 classic Frogger, which remains as enjoyable as ever. And at only $29.99, the control drawbacks are a littler easier to stomach.", "date": "Sep 27, 2005"}
