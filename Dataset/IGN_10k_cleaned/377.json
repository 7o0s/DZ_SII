{"name": "Discworld", "name_review": "Discworld", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/21/discworld", "text": "Discworld is a very interesting game to say the least. It's based on the comic novels of Terry Pratchett, and features narration by former-Monty Python funnyman Eric Idle. It's challenging and long and ... well, it's slow. OK, all games on disc run a little slow, especially graphic adventures which rely heavily on graphics, I'll give you that. And in all fairness this is a really entertaining game. It's just so slow!  You're a wizard who wanders through a beautifully rendered medieval cartoon land. Along the way you have to collect certain items, talk to certain people, and solve some puzzles. The game is absolutely hilarious, and is worth it almost for the humor alone. Eric idle really is a treat. The other plus to the game is its length. There is a total of four acts, each containing lots of challenges to overcome. This means there's lots to do, see, and explore.  Like I said before, though, Discworld is terribly slow. If you can sit through the long load times, this title has a lot to offer.", "date": "Nov 21, 1996"}
