{"name": "Flutter", "name_review": "Flutter Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/22/flutter-review", "text": "IGN Wireless has long been a proponent of simpler, casual games -- not every gamer wants an epic adventure with 300 moves mapped to 17 different buttons. But without a compelling game play mechanic, sometimes a simple game can become so casual that it ceases to be much of an engagement. Such is the case with Limelife's Flutter, an honorable effort but is ultimately unfulfilling.   Now, you might counter this assessment with, ~Well, the game wasn't made for you.~ But I'll point you to my sterling review of I-play's Skipping Stone, a one-button game (like Flutter) that takes on an ultra-simple concept, but offers a great vibe.   The single-button control in Flutter controls a tiny butterfly named Flip. Holding the button makes Flip fly upward while he automatically flitters horizontally. Release the button and the butterfly gently descends. At no point does the butterfly ever stop moving. You just control its altitude. You can change horizontal direction by bouncing off a ledge, which is necessary to collect all of the treasure in each level, such as diamonds and stars.   The levels are steadily populated by more and more enemies (none look especially threatening -- but that's half the point) and Flip can only withstand a few hits before the little fella falls. Which is borderline depressing, since the game is so cute.    But again, while I understand that the game is not meant to be overly challenging, I think it's so impishly easy that most gamers -- no matter whom the are -- won't be compelled to stick with Flutter. Even the Distance Mode, which measure how long you can fly through an endless level of enemies, doesn't really compel.  I completely support Limelife's mission to offer alternative gaming for the player that doesn't want hardcore action or complex mechanics. But Flutter goes too far in the opposite direction. It's certainly cute, but with so little going on, there's little reason to stick with it.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
