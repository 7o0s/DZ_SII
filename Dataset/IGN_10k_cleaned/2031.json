Here's where Syscom's City Crisis comes in as it's one of the first of its kind to make an appearance on a major console platform. For this, City Crisis gets some kudos, but outside of its uniqueness, the game lacks any sort of punch that will compel anyone to fork out the dough for it.    Gameplay  The biggest problem is that there isn't really all that much to the game, as outside of a very slim Training and Time Attack mode, all we have here is a fairly bare bones Mission mode. In this mode, players are given the chance to select from a list of available missions that include three different types -- rescue, chase, and final rescue.    The rescue missions have the player fly around in the copter of his or her choosing with the general goal to quickly put out all of the fires in the city and save as many lives before time runs out. While the chase missions require the player to help assist the police in chasing down some suspects by following them in the copter and shining a searchlight on them for as long as possible. And the final rescue, which is the final mission of the game, features a mix of all the different types of things the player has learned up until this point.   The missions are pretty straightforward, but things get a little more complicated than they ever should be because the control gets in the way. Navigating your copter is easy enough with the left analog stick controlling your general movement, forward, backward, left, right, and the right analog stick handling the turning and the altitude.    Where the problem comes in is with the camera perspective and determining the height of the buildings and other objects in the backgrounds. Because of the static almost over-the-top view that the game is played from, it's much too difficult to tell where the copter is in relation to the buildings, so players will find themselves slamming into buildings on a fairly regular basis.   Graphics  Now that we've seen a glimpse of what is possible with the PlayStation 2 with games like Gran Turismo 3 A-spec, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Final Fantasy X, it's becoming more difficult to accept games that just don't stack up. City Crisis is one of these games as the visuals that it offers just don't seem to use even a small portion of the system's power.   First of all, the game suffers from some of the worst interlace flickering that you'll find in any game on the system, including the original Japanese launch titles like Ridge Racer V. What's more, the backgrounds are made up of very simple textures and blocky polygonal models and most of the special effects, whether it be a flame or the water spraying from the helicopter, just aren't the least bit impressive.   The only real positive here is that the city environments that you get to fly around in are fairly expansive and contain a lot of varied structures and even a few more active elements like moving amusement park rides. Even still, the backgrounds on the whole still feel lifeless and it would've been nice to see a little more traffic and pedestrians on the city streets.   Sound  Just like the rest of the game, the audio in City Crisis just screams mediocrity. There are sound effects for the helicopter blades cutting through the air and very basic, arcade-like, sound effects for the water spraying and for the helicopter crashing into building walls and while there are spurts of character voices throughout the game, they don't offer any kind of real variety. The best way to describe the audio in the game is that it sounds like something you'd get out of a very generic arcade game.Even though City Crisis was playable at the past three Tokyo Game Shows and I actually put some hands-on time with it and filmed some footage, I opted not to put anything up on it all three times because it just didn't seem worth it. First, it looked like it was going to be one of those games that would never see the light of day in the United States and second, it just wasn't all that good. Knowing this, it was a big shock when the announcement was made before this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo that Take 2 Interactive had picked it up for release in the States. While it has admittedly improved some over the versions that were shown at the previous Tokyo Game Shows, but City Crisis still stands as a game that probably should have been left alone in Japan. If it was one of Take 2's $9.99 budget titles it might be worth a look, but as a full-priced PlayStation 2 game, you'll want to pass this one up without a second thought.", "date": "Jul 20, 2001"}
