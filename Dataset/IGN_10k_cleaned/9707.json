The Golden Compass, the new game from SEGA that coincides with the release of this Christmas's biggest box-office pull, does little to change this and reinforces the reputation of film tie-ins as slap-dash affairs designed with the sole intention of mopping up the cash in the wake of their cinematic counterparts.    Shiny Entertainment - the game's developer - is no stranger to the world of movie cash-ins, having been responsible for the ambitious but ultimately disappointing spin on the Wachowski brothers' sci-fi trilogy, Enter The Matrix. And much like that earlier attempt The Golden Compass has a strong empathy for its source material, and you sense that without the strict deadlines imposed by the impending film's release, a half-decent game could have eventually emerged. Unfortunately, as it is the end result is evidently a rush job, with the player left limping from one set-piece to another in an uninspired mix of platforming, puzzling and combat.   The most part of the game is spent in control of The Golden Compasses' heroine, the outspoken orphan Lyra Belacqua. Aided by her daemon Pan, Lyra's sections of the game centre around exploration and exposition, briefly relieved by some limp platforming sections. In addition, Pan's ability to shape-shift between four different forms adds a little depth to the gameplay as you adapt your daemon to each different problem, althuogh the majority of puzzles are so painfully simple anyone with an ounce of intelligence will breeze through them in a matter of seconds.   Lyra's daemon Pan has the ability to change forms.  Elsewhere, a lot of Lyra's time is taken up talking to other characters and attempting to deceive your way to your destination. It's these sections that grate the most, largely because Shiny has bizarrely opted to drop in mini-games during the conversations, which you have to complete to continue. These mini-games are a series of increasingly infuriating and obtuse catch / collect / maneuver tasks and prove to be unwelcome 60-second diversions with broken controls that kill any flow in the dialogue, eventually becoming the bane of Lyra's sections.   The voice acting too is of a  poor standard. Admittedly the film's Dakota Blue Richards and Freddie Highmore are on board to lend their talents, but the rest of the cast is filled out by stand-ins, which range from the passable to the downright laughable. Of particular note is the voice of Lord Asriel, played in the film by Daniel Craig but here being acted out by someone stranded in the middle of the Atlantic, as their accent dithers between clipped English and an American twang.    One of the more admirable aspects of the game comes in the shape of the titular Golden Compass, granted to Lyra early on in the game. A dial marked out by numerous symbols, the player must divine their meaning using a certain amount of cunning and in-game clues. By answering correctly that the symbol of the clock represents not only time but death, for example, the player is awarded with another mini-game that, if successfully completed, will result in an answer to one of the questions thrown up by the games story. You're rarely called upon to actually use the device, however, so it only remains a brief (but entertaining) diversion.   At certain points Lyra will come face-to-face with a combatant that prompts an overlong QTE sequence, as she attempts to evade her way out of danger. These sections are poorly implemented, with no rhythm or grace as you mindlessly pound at the required controls. The combat gets deeper when the player takes control of Iorek, a polar bear warrior tasked with guiding Lyra through waves of hostile parties, but most battles can be won simply by mindlessly hitting attack.   What's more, it's here that the enforced viewpoint, which plights much of The Golden Compass, really intrudes upon the gameplay. Indeed, you're often left struggling with a stubborn camera that pays little attention to any threats onscreen, which is not great when your range of defence moves is so limited.   Adventuring in The Golden Compass is limited.  Of course, all this is by-the-by as The Golden Compass's minimal gameplay is clearly aimed at a younger audience enthralled by its cinematic sibling, and on a postive note the game retains the charm of some of its source material. Locations are well realised and throughout the game you're accompanied by a stirring soundtrack lifted from the film.   The story, however, is a mess standing on its own. Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials world is a dense one, and getting across just a small amount of such a fully-realised fantasy universe is something even the film has struggled with. The game makes little attempt to portray Pullman's world, instead opting to magpie scenes from the film and career through the story with little concession for the player. Characters disappear without explanation and large parts of the story are side-stepped, leaving the less informed player scratching their head as to what exactly is going on. Sure, levels are interspersed with clips from the film, but these only serve to highlight the clay-faced features of the game's player models and do little to ease the narrative flow.  The sad inevitability of The Golden Compass is that no amount of shoddy design will halt its rise to the upper end of the charts this Christmas. The lazy mix of disparate genres, as well as the clearly rushed execution, earn it a place alongside a long list of movie tie-ins that have a distinct lack of quality. Just spare a thought for the poor children who wake to this limp imitation of a game come December 25th.", "date": "Dec 7, 2007"}
