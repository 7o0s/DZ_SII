What you can, old-school Vegas (not the family-friendly abomination) is hot again, and JAMDAT Mobile aims to capitalize with Hard Rock Casino.   Features:   Three games: poker, black jack, slot machine   Before the Palms sprouted up and stole headlines with celeb tourneys and tawdry pop star weddings, the Hard Rock Casino was THE place to be in Vegas -- especially if you wanted to see a bleary-eyed Ben Affleck over-tipping waitresses. But that really hasn't diminished the joint's cool atmosphere, and that's JAMDAT's hook. If you can't hit Vegas, at least you can get a little classy casino action on your handset.   The problem is, though, that Hard Rock Casino isn't really any better than most casino games out there. Sure, the price is right ($1.99 on most carriers), but the lead attraction -- poker -- is handled better in other games.   Dubbed Lonely Hearts Poker, the goal is to create a poker hand as good as or greater than a pair of tens. A couple of eights gets you jack. And you play all by yourself. There is no competition, hence the Lonely Hearts moniker. It's actually a fairly dull rendition of poker, considering some of the better sims on handsets, like Downtown Wireless' Texas Hold'Em and Sorrents' 5-Card Draw MP.   The slot machine section is pretty standard fare. The machine is music-themed, but it's pretty much the same kind of three-line slot you can find on other games. It's certainly no worse.   And blackjack is, well, blackjack.   However, Hard Rock Casino does offer superlative presentation. We tested the game on an LGX7000, and the game looked pretty nice. The real estate is clean and used well, with crystal clear icons and cards. The system of placing bets, calling cards, and pulling handles is easy to use. You can't ask for much else out of a casino sim, and it's good to see JAMDAT nail that.Hard Rock Casino is a middle-of-the-pack casino game that offers three different games for a good price. You can find better versions of each game elsewhere, but they are single-serving games. For $2, you have average versions of all three in one place. Budget-minded gamers may find that to be a very acceptable trade-off.", "date": "Sep 29, 2004"}
