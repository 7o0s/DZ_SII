The title, which delivered players an unparalleled story, at-the-time gorgeous graphics and movie-like production values, as well as new, sophisticated gameplay mechanics and controls, inspired a slew of me-too clones. You can spot hints of Solid Snake's influence even some six-plus years later in games such as Splinter Cell and James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing.   Though PlayStation 2's Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty improved upon the original in very recognizable ways -- better graphics, more control options -- many MGS fans felt that the storyline in the first title remained far superior.  GameCube owners now get the best of both worlds. Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, developed jointly by Canadian-based Silicon Knights (Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem) and Konami of Japan, is a full-fledged remake of the game that started Metal Gear Mania. The two studios, working closely together, have stayed true to the original's design and considerable storyline, but have surrounded both with noticeably updated visuals, new cinematic cut-scenes, and advanced play options ripped directly from the sequel. The result: a usually riveting stealth-action experience with unequaled presentation. Twin Snakes arrives as a collector's item for fans of the long-running series. But improvements noted, some disappointing indications of the game's true age still remain.  The Facts  The PlayStation hit Metal Gear Solid remade for GameCube owners Play as Solid Snake, a deadly operative deployed to rescue hostages from an Alaskan base Features a powerful, wholly cinematic storyline completely re-directed and re-choreographed by Konami Use a combination of stealth and combat techniques to sneak unto and execute terrorist enemies Utilize a wide variety of weapons and gadgets from automatic guns to cigarettes Features play mechanics -- first-person shooting, rail-hanging, guard-dragging -- from Metal Gear Solid 2 Completely overhauled and enhanced graphics Single-player game Runs in progressive scan Runs in Dolby Pro Logic II    Gameplay What most PlayStation fans already know and few Nintendo loyalists probably realize is that Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes -- like the game it's based on -- features a truly epic storyline. It is this story, filled with plot twists and subtleties, which is the backbone for the stealth and combat elements that engulf it. It may in fact be the game's greatest achievement. So if you played and were amazed by the presentation in the original title then prepare to be completely floored here.   Total MGS: TTS Coverage! Finally Solid Snake arrives on GameCube in his own exclusive title, a remake of the first 3D title within the series. We not only have a detailed video review, but also high-res movies, and even custom wallpaper for your computer desktop.   Video Review High-Res Movies Custom Wallpaper Stategy Guide  Join Insider Today  The game features several hours of cut-scenes, which is why it comes on two discs, and though the dialogue remains the same throughout Konami has really upped the quality of the cinematics. All of the voice actors, including David Hayter, have re-acted and re-recorded their speech work for these sequences. Most of the changes are for the better, but a handful of MGS purists may complain about the differences. For instance, one of the characters who spoke with a strong Asian accent in the PS1 title talks without any accent at all in Twin Snakes. Meanwhile the action, guided by famed Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura (Versus), has been totally re-choreographed and it now shines with bullet-time camera pans and dazzling character acrobatics. And the graphics have been enhanced so dramatically that at points the real-time scenes appear to be more detailed and more stylized than many of the more impressive fully CG rendered videos in other games.     The story, which begins with operative Solid Snake inside an underwater pod which has been jettisoned toward a weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago, will suck you in from the very start because it's so well presented. The narrative is not shallow or unrefined, as tales in many of today's high-budgeted titles sadly remain, but smart and gritty, with unexpected bits of humor and a confidence by creator Hideo Kojima to every so often step outside of the game and poke fun at it. Snake is a rough and gruff agent who can fight, can shoot, and can easily use just about any high-tech gadget out there, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have any time to hit on women or to stop for a cigarette.  The plot thickens shortly after Snake infiltrates the enemy's hideout and people -- good and bad -- start dying. Suddenly you're not sure who to trust, which keeps the suspense level raised, and on top of that the answers come slowly and wrapped in several surprises, a truth that will likely keep you intrigued throughout the experience. Eventually Snake will learn of the Metal Gear project, will do battle with an invisible and wholly psychotic ninja, will fight against a sniper assassin, and may even fall in love. Of course, we're not telling so you'll just have to play it.  Which leads us right into the subject of gameplay. Twin Snakes is the granddaddy of all stealth-action games and it plays exactly as you might expect. The title unfolds in the third-person. Our tough hero sneaks and crawls through enemy environments, uses gadgets, fights up close with enemies and shoots at them from a distance. These options and maneuvers were part of Snake's arsenal in the original game and remain as fun and entertaining as ever to perform. On top of these, Silicon Knights has thankfully injected new abilities -- moves ripped directly from the PS2 sequel. The additions encapsulate everything from being able to target and shoot at enemies in first-person mode (a dynamic that dramatically changes boss fights) to being able to drag the bodies of guards, to hide in lockers, to hang from ledges, and more. These extras can alter the play experience in significant ways, sometimes for the better and other times for the worse. When Snakes finds himself surrounded by a set of soldiers on an upper level, he can now simply hop over the ledge to the ground below. Easy, safe, no mess and no fuss. On the other hand, targeting and blasting at bosses in the first-person can turn what was once a difficult battle into a decidedly easy one, which is a disappointment. You'll occasionally get the sense that more balancing was needed.   The control mechanics feel slightly aged compared to today's cutting edge games, but moving Snake around the ambient locales is enjoyable nonetheless. Old or not, the character is capable of more actions than the heroes in many of today's offerings. Still, as caught up in the game as we often found ourselves, were discouraged to discover that the character moves mostly digitally and without true analog control. Snake can walk and run, but nothing in between. This was of course the standard six years ago, but we've come a long way since then and we had hoped Konami and Silicon Knights might have reflected this in the final product. It can be slightly cumbersome because stealthy movements and precision go hand in hand, and digital control doesn't always offer that flexibility. In contrast, Snake can look around in first-person with full analog control, which means that targeting and shooting down enemies a great distance away is far more intuitive and ultimately satisfying than it has ever been in the past.  While the fight mechanics are passable -- even better than some, they are far from perfect. Perhaps it's because the cut-scenes are so cinematically brilliant that some of the combat sequences feel almost anticlimactic by comparison. In one cut-scene, the ninja rips through a squad of guards, literally cutting them to bloody pieces with his sword, all the while flipping off walls and disappearing right before their eyes. It's an awesome display of cinematography and choreography. But when Snake only moments later fights the character, he's reduced to a simplified version of his former self and can all too easily be bested with a handful of kicks. Snake cannot target enemies with a lock-on system. You simply point in the general direction and hope all goes well. These do not make the experience bad -- it's still very engaging. They do, however, keep it from soaring to the same heights as the title's presentation does.     The game impresses again and again with strong computer character artificial intelligence. Enemies were not exactly dumb in the original title and yet they are a lot smarter in Twin Snakes. If you make stupid decisions, fail to be stealthy or simply run out and try to be Rambo, the soldiers will find, chase and kill you, we guarantee it. They will search inside lockers, underneath boxes, and through doors and they will call for back up too. As a result, you'll encounter difficulties and you might find yourself truly frightened by the thought of being discovered, a testament to the crafty employment of the enemy characters.     There is a lot of variety in Twin Snakes. Our trusty operative will travel from warehouses to snow, do battle with giant mercenaries, with quick-drawing gunslingers, stay off enemies with the power to corrupt one's mind, and forge a friendship with an anime freak, too. The game never seems repetitive and never grows stale. There's always something new to see and an intriguing new story development to ponder. And before you've even put all the clues together, it's all over. The original was a decidedly short game and Twin Snakes is no different. What that really means is this: if you already played it and know what to do, you'll be able to super-speed through the entire game in a three or so hours flat, not considering cut-scenes. If, on the other hand, Snake's universe is entirely new to you, you might just be able to get six, eight or more ~solid~ hours of it. You might consider this short and you're right, but so are some of the best movies out there, and like a very good movie Twin Snakes will grab you and hold you to the very end.  Graphics You have this grand vision of Metal Gear Solid. It was the best-looking game ever to grace PlayStation 1 and that beauty holds up even today. We hate to burst your bubble, but the game is not nearly as pretty as you remember it. In preparation for this review, we loaded up the now-classic and played through a good portion of it. The environments and colors are still on par with our memory, but the poly counts and textures, not to mention filters and lighting effects, are just about as barren as possible. We realize we're talking about a six-year-old game and of course we forgive these technical limitations. We're merely pointing out that Twin Snakes has made considerable advancements in all of the following areas.   Style. MGS had it and Twin Snakes overflows with it. Be it the artistic sense, the strong character design or the stunning cut-scenes, you're going to be dazzled.   Geometry. Characters and objects are more rounded and realistic. Snake's face has edges, a nose, and real features that stick out. The character's clothing, buckles and gun are all polygonal in nature, which means that they too have real curves and surfaces. The worlds themselves feature noticeably higher polygon counts. There are additional objects on-screen. The architecture appears to be more defined and in some cases there are some big, wide-open worlds being drawn on-screen at once.  Particles are far better. Weather effects like snow now truly rain down and surround the character as he makes his way around the environments. Water streaks down the camera. Blood splatters realistically in all directions. And this is a shockingly gory game at points. We were surprised at the level of carnage it dishes out. Meanwhile everything from fire effects to dirt and wind look fantastic and really add a tangible level of realism to the whole affair.  Texture work is a mixed bag. Some of the textures in the game, especially when coupled with the filtering effects that GameCube delivers, are very well done. Snake's face looks spectacular up close. There is a wide selection of texturing effects from reflections and bump-mapping to specular highlights and transparencies, all of which naturally arrive as very pleasing additions. There is a scene involving the ninja that will amaze you. Even when the camera is directly in front of the character, you'll be amazed that it's running in real-time on Nintendo's hardware, it's that good. And yet oppositely there are textures in the game that appear overly blurry to the point that they seem to be leftovers from the original build with some filtering applied. These, as you might have already guessed, are far less impressive.     Animation -- that is to say cut-scene motion -- is absolutely superb. Some of the best we've seen in a videogame. Konami should be rewarded for the cut-scenes it put together here -- and using the game engine even! The in-game movements are not quite as impressive, especially during combat, but overall Snake's motion is fluid and uninterrupted, not to mention believable.  In addition to everything else, the game features an advanced real-time lighting system. Lights illuminate the foreground. Snake and other characters boast full facial animation. Depending on the environment he's in, the character may also sport impressive shadows that project and morph onto the surrounding objects.   This is a very pretty game. It even runs in progressive scan mode. Our only real gripe is that it doesn't also always run at 60 frames per second. Instead, in wide-open environments and during combat sequences with lots of particles the action may hiccup. It's not a major problem, but it's noticeable and given that Konami got MGS2 running so smoothly without interruption on PS2 we'd be liars if we said that we weren't disappointed it couldn't do the same for this GameCube remake. That said, we'd estimate that sixty percent or more of the game does run at 60 frames per second and we're certainly thankful for that much.  Sound Very strong. The game runs in Dolby Pro Logic II on GameCube for a full surround sound experience and we can tell you from experience that it's an audio showpiece. Nearly all of the actors who supplied voices for the original game have returned to do new, higher-quality samples for Twin Snakes. The acting is top notch and believable, a must for a game of this type. The sound effects are deep and satisfying, from the bass of an explosion to the sounds of gunfire. And the music is both subtle and atmospheric at points and wholly epic others.    Die-hard Metal Gear fans may be disappointed by the fact that the classic MGS theme has been dramatically altered in Twin Snakes, but we think everybody else will be very happy with what they hear.Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is a damn fine update to one of PlayStation's best games. It's supported by one of the most compelling storylines in a videogame to date -- epic, engaging, entertaining and ultimately very satisfying. It features perhaps the best story presentation of any title out there. This is unquestionably the case if we only consider real-time cinematics in games and not pre-rendered CG sequences. And for the most part it's a lot of fun to play, successfully combining seat-of-your-pants stealth elements with action and puzzle-solving aspects. Did I mention the game features some of the better graphics on Nintendo's console? Add all of this up and you have something very special. If you've never played Metal Gear before, you should stop reading this review right now and pick up a copy of Twin Snakes -- I think you'll be pleased.But there are disappointments. There is so much story, so much interrupting dialogue, that I oftentimes found myself wishing for more game and less narrative. And as a result of such epic cut-scenes, the actual combat with the big enemies on occasion felt anticlimactic. Not only that, but some of the control decisions -- still no analog sensitivity when maneuvering Snake, for instance -- seemed to peel back the game's updated skin and give me a glimpse of its true age. And finally there's the issue of length -- Twin Snakes is every bit as short as the original, though I would argue that despite all of these issues you'll still find it a compelling and entertaining game and worth the price of purchase.GameCube owners in search of an excellent adult app -- it's arrived.
