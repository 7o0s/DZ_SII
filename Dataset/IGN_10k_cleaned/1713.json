Alright, maybe it wasn't necessarily even a good one.  But since seasonal updates are fairly cheap, and the likelihood of Bethesda finding a satisfactory number of potential buyers on one platform to justify development costs were slim, the token 2001 PC edition has arrived with a Dreamcast port hot on its heels.  As a result, IBM-compatible equipped sports fans can laugh heartily, knowing they soon won't be suffering alone.  What new features were added for the millennium?  Well, the marketing hype claims that you can now purportedly link up with alley cats across the world through LAN/TCP-IP support, enjoy sexier visuals and frolic on the hardwood using an enhanced physics model.  On these fronts, if none other, yours truly can concur.  Nevertheless, astute buyers will note that the gameplay and personality deficiencies from the original have not been improved.  Curse that damnable foreshadowing!  Consider how the interface once again relies on a three-click system that sets power, accuracy, and backspin variables.  While reflex intensive, the dummy accessible play mechanics can be mastered much faster than in the last version, and they're still not especially fun to tinker with.  During generic tournaments or open bowling sessions, players must also sit idly by another round as every participant involved takes their turn, regardless of whether said bowler is AI controlled.  Furthermore, though the physics engine is strong mathematically, enabling pros to nail strikes with powerful curved throws, you'll have one helluva time trying to copy such finesse.  It's as if the computer opponents were created solely for purposes of player humiliation.  Additional troubles such as the aforementioned lack of flair cripple the product as well.  For two years running now, lanes sport little detail, hideous scoreboard fonts, and absolutely zilch in terms of background activity.  Changing venues is pointless, since playing at Tombstone's no different than a jaunt in Vegas, notwithstanding a few minor environmental texture swaps.  Sterile isn't the word; these environments lack a stinkin' pulse.  Is it so much to ask for animated sequences that run after strikes and spares, a little cosmetic polish, or just a glimpse of some random schmoes enjoying a casual round for atmospheric purposes?    Apparently Bethesda's answer is an emphatic ~darn tootin'!~  The only meaningful feature their code monkeys have added is comprehensive multiplayer support.  Yet with server rooms so barren that a tumbleweed truck could blow through unnoticed, you'll have serious trouble finding willing victims for solo or team play match-ups.  And the Dreamcast version isn't out yet, so testing cross platform compatibility was impossible.  One should also be aware that our good buddies in Maryland added and subtracted little touches from the presentation arbitrarily too.  So while you're bitching over the fact that you no longer have any pre-programmed amateur alter-egos available, don't forget to dance a jig over those career prize money records and other obscure facts which flash on the screen when a professional player hogs the spotlight.  Flashier character graphics and improved frame rates beef up the in-game display, though.  Custom designed overweight bald-headed goons and similarly modeled PBA tour celebrities run, roll, and recover all the more realistically for it.  However, locales look no better than they did last time around, and personas boast no facial expressions or unique quirks.  Picture a bunch of robots who clap their hands once or twice before sitting down, even if they just nailed a turkey (aka three strikes in a row for the anti-orthopedic shoe and personalized ball crowd).  Luckily some great views of the action atone for any charismatic shortcomings, despite the disturbingly weak array of sound effects which accompany all on-screen proceedings.  More effort was clearly invested in the title's primo selection of funkafied rock and jazz tunes than anything else.  Disappointing as it is, PBA Tour Bowling 2001 represents a slight step forward for the series.  If the production team saw fit to give this package a new paint job and schematic overhaul, tacking on more play options in the process, it'd be a strong contender. Right now, though, the end result of several months' effort only hints at heretofore untapped potential.  Granted, that's more than a certain predecessor can claim, but as the situation stands, it ain't a ballsy enough proposition to convince enthusiastic bowlers to part with their precious pesos.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
