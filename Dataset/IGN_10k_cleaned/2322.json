But then most of you wouldn't bother, so here it is handily excerpted for you, courtesy Merriam-Webster's:  capricious (kuh-pree-shus): adj. governed or characterized by caprice (a sudden, impulsive, and seemingly unmotivated notion or action.)  Wave Rally, the Opus-developed jetski racer just recently released by Eidos Interactive, is a very capricious sort of game.  To a certain degree, that's to be expected and welcomed -- water is a capricious thing, and so a realistic virtual representation of water ought to act that way some of the time.  But all things are best in moderation, since that's usually what makes for a fun game, a moderate dose of reality.  Wave Rally often gives us a little more of that than seems absolutely necessary.  Gameplay  Wave Rally does some things quite well.  It has good track design, for the most part, blending loops with linear courses and doing a good job of ramping up the difficulty level.  Early tracks have simple buoy formations and easy obstacles, gradually building up to twisty tracks with complex lines that you have to pick your way through and learn through several races.  It's particularly cool to come back to a course you visited earlier in the championship mode and find its dynamics completely changed by the addition of new waves and weather effects.  Issues of boat handling, camera placement, and wave behavior come together to make control more of a chore than it probably ought to be, though.  To begin with, the turn radius of your watercraft is generally pretty wide, especially when you're under power.  The trouble is, it's hard to reduce that radius without taking your thumb off the throttle (trying to hold back and turn or forward and turn causes all kinds of bizarre happenings), and if you know anything about jetski handling, you'll know that destroys your cornering ability entirely, since you need thrust to push yourself around a curve.  These vehicles don't drift like cars.  This is aggravating on the stand-up jetskis and a frightful annoyance on the sitdown runabouts -- the latter are like steering a floating elephant.  The partial solution is to take a very wide line into the turn, swinging out one way before you turn in the other.  Here, however, is where the camera comes into play.  The default setting in Wave Rally is a little too close and a little too high, meaning that you're often cornering completely blind, since the camera won't swing around far enough to show you what you're turning towards.  You can switch out to a slightly more distant perspective, but that only helps a little.  This frequently plants you into obstacles or throws you on the wrong line to hit the next buoy -- it's possible in some spots to not even see the next buoy until you're past it on the wrong side.  This, too, would not be a problem, were the waves that shove you around a little more predictable.  This is where that issue of caprice comes in.  In many situations, the random motion of the game's waves will give you an unexpected boost or an unwelcome shove backwards in an important corner.  Sometimes you'll just be pushed around neatly, others you'll haul on the accelerator and still turn far too wide.  Thus, learning the right lines through a course will only get you so far, because no matter what you do the waves will often throw your strategy out of whack.  It's very hard to read the water in Wave Rally, as compared to something like Wave Race or Splashdown.  In those games, it's easy to follow the currents and see where the water is going to push you.  Wave Rally's sea gives up hardly any of its secrets, with only the biggest rollers offering any warning of where they'll take you.  Obligatory notation: Wave Rally includes a freestyle mode.  Unfortunately, it behaves as erratically as the water upon which you race.  Some trick commands are reliable, but cause an inevitable crash.  Others work only at random.  Still others, so far as we can tell, don't function at all.  In any event, the freestyle mode is not a great deal of fun, and the usefulness of tricks in the racing section of the game is minimal.  End obligatory notation.  Graphics  Wave Rally has an unusual way of presenting its water, quite different from the rest of the water-racing games out there, but it doesn't look bad at all most of the time.  It's much more reflective than what you see in Wave Race or Splashdown, with an almost mercurial sheen when it isn't reflecting the backgrounds or riders.  Its color changes evenly as scenery, weather, and time of day changes, too -- the same course looks very different at daylight and sunset.  Weather patterns realistically change the look and behavior of water, adding more wave animation (all quite smooth) and some nice ripple effects for the rain.  The only questionable aspect of the water is a strange transparency effect that comes into play at the top of a wave.  It's perhaps meant to represent that bit of water warping the background behind it, but in practice it just looks like an animation error.  Outside the water, the framerate remains thoroughly solid save for a few drops at the beginnings of races (when you've got all eight riders on the screen), and the backgrounds are uniformly well-textured, whether they're the skyline in Venice or any number of sunny tropical islands.  The riders don't have that smooth of joint modeling, but they do animate very well when reacting to turns and landings, pushing this way and that in accordance with the movements of their craft and the water. d  Sound  Drum 'n' bass recording outfit Moving Shadow supplies the entire soundtrack to Wave Rally, and their catalog doesn't sound all that bad.  Generally it's the calmer, quieter tracks that suit the game better -- there are a few rather high, tinny pieces (almost with some kind of mutant techno/big band sound) that threaten to bring the ear-bleed, but they're few enough.  Of course, depending on your tastes, it's an open question as to how well this music meshes with the sound of two-stroke engines cutting out, but viewed on their own the engine noises are pretty faithful.  In particular, there's a nice sound of the engines idling down when you catch air and run out of water in your intakes. But we'll back to the negative bits, I'm afraid.  Wave Rally isn't bad to look or listen to, but in the end it seems like more trouble to play in view of the rewards it offers.  Shoving yourself around the courses is a frequently frustrating task, even with a touch of catch-up to the AI.  You can learn a better way around the tracks, sussing out the lines and finding shortcuts (of which there are many), but it's still entirely possible for the strange behavior of the water to throw you off, no matter how hard you try.Capricious, innit?
