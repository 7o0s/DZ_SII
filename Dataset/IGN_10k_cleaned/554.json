Gex: Deep Cover Gecko becomes Gex: Deep Pocket Gecko for the portable market, and while it's not the greatest action-platformer out there, the lizard has made a few good strides since the first time on the handheld.  15 levels  Isometric 3D boss levels  Password save  Only for Game Boy Color   The Game Boy Color game is essentially a portable rendition of the Gex sequel that came out on the PlayStation and recently on the Nintendo 64. The game was developed by the same team that handled Gex: Enter the Gecko on the Game Boy earlier this year -- and in design, it's very similar to the first try. This time, the game is Color only, and it shows -- the graphics are more vibrant, and the levels have a lot more detail. There's just more stuff to do this time around, eliminating that sense of tediousness the first time around. Like the console versions, you go through levels based off of TV and movies, like the Wild West or Rankin/Bass holiday specials, collecting paws and remotes to advance further in the game. Unlike the console versions, this game is a 2D run-and-hop platformer.  To mimic the sense of a third dimension, platforms will slant upward to give you the option of moving to a new part of the world -- like staircases, for example.    The game is easy to play, since you really only have a few abilities -- run, jump, and tailwhip. The controls are very tight.  There are a few problem, though. First, right from the get-go you really don't have any idea what to do or where to go. After a bit of wandering around, you realize you have to find the television to the first level -- it's not directly in front of you. Second -- and I can't believe I'm really complaining about this -- the levels are really, really huge. Probably a bit too large -- you have to complete certain tasks to earn the needed remote control to complete the level. The problem is, the tasks are spread so far apart sometimes that you'll easily get lost trying to locate the next deed to accomplish. For example, in the first level you have to locate five ice blocks and whip them into Gex sculptures. The ice blocks are spread all over this level, and you'll spend a good half-hour trying to find every one. What's worse is that each level has multiple goals, and it never remembers how far you were in one task when you complete another -- you'll have to restart the level and redo all the stuff you completed to earn the other remotes. The problem with large levels is simple -- if you die anywhere in the game, you restart the game back at the beginning of the level, with everything reset. That's pretty annoying if you ask me.  On the plus side, you'll never, ever, ever hear Dana Gould. Ever. God bless the Game Boy Color's sound weakness.  Gex: Deep Pocket Gecko isn't Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, but it is a well put together platformer with some colorful graphics, detailed animations, and plenty to do. Levels do blend into each other  (after all, there's only so much level design you can do in 2D), but thankfully you're given a password at the end of each level so you can take a break. The problems are few but out there, keeping the gecko at an ~above average~ status instead of ~really good.~", "date": "Dec 18, 1999"}
