This you may interpret how you will, to a certain degree.  On the one hand, it's why many people may not like it so much, but on the other hand, it's why it succeeds in my view, because it manages to make of itself a very different game, despite the number of familiar elements in its visuals and game design.  Come to this game expecting SSX Trickier, and you may be disappointed.  Accept Sled Storm on its own merits and you've found a superior arcade racer, just like the PlayStation Sled Storm before it.  This is a racing game, by the way -- in comparison to SSX, which is a smooth blend of tricks and speed, Sled Storm is more of a racer which happens to let you do tricks now and again.  It's a very finely tuned racer, though, with breakneck handling, a great sense of speed, and and level design in the very best EA Sports Big style.  The scale of each course is immense, filled with shortcuts and towering background architecture, and that scale combined with the edge-of-your-seat controls means no lap feels quite the same.  If this is not the ground-breaking experience that SSX was, one can hardly fault EA Big for failing to exceed our wildest expectations with every successive product.  Sled Storm is still a worthy racing game, far better than early versions had led us to believe, and another notch in the belt of what's becoming one of the most respected marques in the business.  Gameplay  Sled Storm, like the PlayStation game of the same name, features uphill, downhill, and cross-country racing on sleds, the things that used to be called ~snowmobiles~ until the term somehow fell out of the politically correct lexicon.  Its handling and basic presentation are drawn from its predecessor, but everything else comes right out of the SSX playbook, at least in a ~big-picture~ sense.  We've got the cast of hip characters, the goofy announcers, the gigantic tracks, and that general sense of ~bigness.~  You understand what I mean at this point, yes?  Much of what is imported wholesale are big ideas, though -- the more specific gameplay elements that the two games seem to have in common have been adapted to fit the different game that Sled Storm certainly is.  The boost scheme is very similar, trick performance increasing the speed-boosting ~STORM~ meter, but that's a good idea for any racing game that incorporates stunts, and boosting isn't nearly as important as clean riding here.  The trick system should also inspire deja vu, given that it employs combinations of the shoulder buttons and a ~tweak~ button on the face (the triangle button in this case).  As befits the de-emphasized role of tricks in Sled Storm, though, they're easier to do, with none of the complex flip controls from SSX or the massive emphasis on trick combinations.  You can get away with doing tricks now and again in Sled Storm, just one at a time, and that's alright.  Just staying on the track is challenge enough.  As mentioned in coverage of preview versions, the handling in Sled Storm neatly walks a tightrope between being too sedate and impossible to control.  The trick the designers have pulled off is a game that's only just controllable, that continually feels like it's about to fly out of control, and does so whenever your concentration lapses.  It is not possible to win a race in Sled Storm without paying attention -- failure to keep hauling on the steering one way or the other in response to the newest twists in the terrain is invariably punished by crashing into trees, falling off cliffs, or dropping face-first into the giant lava flows (more on the creative level design later).  Reading the course and continually responding to it is vital for getting through the immediate challenges and preparing for future laps, especially when it comes to picking out shortcuts.  Every course is riddled with shortcuts, big ones and small ones, which is just one aspect of the awesome scope of the levels.  Sled Storm's tracks are as ~big~ as any in SSX, with the added bonus of uphill and downhill sections to mix up things on the Z-axis.  Huge chunks of stuff are everywhere, most of it ridable, and the better part signifying one of the alternate routes that prove vital to pulling ahead.  It's a great feeling to fly off the course into what seems like nothing but window-dressing and find a whole new section of the track instead, one that gives a big boost to your place in the rankings.  On the related subject of rankings, Sled Storm seems to employ a little of the yo-yo AI that characterized the Need for Speed series -- opponents always seem to stay pretty close behind you, no matter how far you might seem to pull ahead -- but the other riders seem more realistically intelligent than the obnoxious AI drivers in NFS, and they never actually take over the lead unless you obviously screw up.  Ride straight and level over the packed track and you'll win without being challenged so much, but remember that that's a harder task than you might think, and the AI takes shortcuts just like you might, so they can still steal a march if you drive too conservatively.  Difficulty ramps up gradually through the tracks -- the opener, Cedar Canyon, is a nice introduction, slowly fading into harder and more complex tracks like Rumble Ridge, the one with the lava pools.  The progressive championship offers a few different objectives to address at different times.  Placing high unlocks new tracks and sleds, while scoring high unlocks new riders (one per track, with a varying score minimum).  That latter unlocking method doesn't work quite so well sometimes, since going for lots of tricks generally means a lot of corresponding crashes, guaranteeing a low finishing place.  It's a combination of the race and showoff schemes from SSX that doesn't work quite so well as it might.  Even so, though, an advanced rider can score enough to unlock a new character and still place first, but they'll probably have to go back to an earlier track to do it.  Nothing wrong with that, though, given that all of the courses are worth a second look (and third, fourth, et cetera).  There are a couple of other modes for doing just that in, especially the Rival Challenge, which allows you to race for an opponent's sled.  It's like High Stakes mode in Need for Speed -- win, and you get another character's sled, but a loss means you have to unlock the sled you used over again.  If you'd rather race for something nonessential, like plain old bragging rights, the two-player split-screen features no drop in framerate that I can see.      Graphics  If this isn't the SSX terrain engine, there are at least some familiar textures, mainly the snow and ice textures that make up the principal track surfaces.  Whatever the technical details, though, the overall character of design and execution in the background graphics definitely recalls SSX.  There's the same immense scale, good detail up close, and superb variety of architecture scattered about.  Nearly every corner has something different to look at around the other side, the courses being big enough (three minutes to a lap at times) to fit a lot of extras in.  The track with the lava flows also includes two or three routes through a giant Incan temple, and Polarfest, which starts out as a bizarre funhouse level (giant clown heads and Ferris wheels included), manages to include a massive ice-cave section down the back stretch, with an entrance like a whale opening its mouth to swallow you.  The lighting and special effects in Sled Storm are both subtle and otherwise, depending on the situation.  Obviously, the headlights, torchlights, and massive snow plumes kicked up by opponents' sleds (thick enough to obscure vision at times) are impressive, but looking over the way the levels are lit shows some smaller touches as well.  Buildings and other background objects are shadowed appropriately by the architecture around them, and different areas (like that cave) have different qualities of light shining on both the level and the riders.  The STORM speed-boost also does some nice stuff with exhaust backfires as well as the full-screen motion blur it creates.  Sled Storm's trick animations look good, especially each rider's overblown signature tricks, but the details of rider animation were probably a more difficult feature to get quite right.  Riders react very well to impacts from the terrain and opponents, with every limb bouncing or pulling in the right direction -- it gives the impression that they're actually trying to control a vehicle, rather than just sitting on top of it while it moves independently.  The 360 x-up double can-cans are nice too, though, don't get me wrong.  Sound  Unfortunately, among the elements Sled Storm doesn't share with SSX is the latter's brilliant dynamic soundtrack -- Sled Storm features only some solid licensed and original tunes, a suitably heavy suite of sound effects, an excellent cast of voice actors, and DTS 5.1-channel surround sound.  It says something about the sound engineering in SSX that the word ~only~ appears in that last sentence.  Sled Storm is still a cut above the rest in terms of audio production values, with the added bonus of lots of Canadian rock and roll.  That's a bonus if you're into Canadian rock, anyway.  The voice clips could inspire similarly mixed reactions, but I like most of them, both the characters and the announcing team, half of which you might recognize as pro-wrestling great Mean Gene Okerlund.  Luckily, Gene plays the straight-man to his goofball sidekick, thus preventing him from hyping his hotline or bringing up the imminent debut of the Gobbledegooker.  Engine noise is what plays most of the time, and that is very good, capturing the rough, guttural feel of a barely-muffled two-stroke engine.  It blends well with the mixed road noises, too, the swish of the skids up front and the chewing sound of the tracks behind.  When sleds come into contact, there's more to the sound than just a dull thud -- the clattering effect gives a better impression of real machines bumping together, with multiple parts clanking around, rather than two solid objects.What is to be said against Sled Storm?  In the end, it's still an evolution of the PlayStation game, rather than the revolution that was SSX.  The EA Big treatment has certainly done wonders for what was already a good racing game, leading to improvements in the track design and lending the franchise a substantial helping of personality, but it remains something familiar done better, rather than something completely new.If you want a fun arcade racer, though, there probably aren't many better choices on PS2.  It certainly beats hell out of Arctic Thunder, if you even remember that one anymore.  That counts off another genre rehabilitated by EA Big's medicine -- now, to see what they can do with motocross...", "date": "Mar 12, 2002"}
