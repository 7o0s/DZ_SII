American Conquest: Fight Back is an RTS, but with a weighty dose of strategic complexity and historical depth. It's also a ~stand-alone expansion pack,~ so it basically uses the same engine--but it adds a messload of new content that doesn't require the original American Conquest to play. If you're looking for an RTS with more depth than the usual cycle of gathering resources, building structures and throwing armies at the enemy, you may want to take a look at Fight Back, but there are a few caveats to be aware of.   First, though, let's talk about the sheer content. You'll get the original American Conquest which includes over 40 missions in addition to the expansion's 25; Five new colonizing nations to play, including the Russians, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands; new units and huge map. At 1024x768, you can scroll up to 30 times from side to side and 20 times from top to bottom and not be looking at the same part of the map. And with up to 16,000 units per map, you'll need all the space you can get.   Yes, those extra zeroes are correct. You'll be managing an obscene amount of troops and juggling melee fighters with riflemen, archers, cavalry, cannon and more.  Thankfully, they're not too difficult to handle, if you have a flag-bearer and drummer. With those two key players, you'll be able to organize the above groups into separate formations for protection, wedging and flanking. However, this seems arbitrary, when all you should need are some well-trained troops and a few officers. The flag-bearer and drummer also triple your men's morale, which gives them bonuses for attack and defense. You'll also get a smaller bonus if you're near your headquarters.    Each unit has a maintenance cost, and in keeping with the realistic theme, that resource is primarily food, which you'll also need to create new units. Like some other recent RTSs, you will not be able to create soldiers from scratch, though. You have to buy some peasants and then train them. This is time-consuming in the thick of battle, because you have to make the peasant, take him over to the barracks, and then train him. You'll have to have plenty of extra soldiers patrolling around defending town, instead of being able to just pop out a bunch when someone comes knocking.    You'll also want to build up defenses inside the buildings, otherwise they can be captured just by walking into them. While most structures just allow you to fire from the windows, the forts and fortresses have cannons, which are great fun for cutting down advance clusters. If you place a couple of those well enough, you can hold off a steady stream, but not an organized force. If that occurs, you'll need a hefty contingent on the ground. The town will also have to be covered from all angles, and not just from enemy troops, but from wildlife as well, which will wander in periodically and cheerfully slaughter your peasants while they go about gathering wood, reaping wheat, and other resource gathering. The peasants won't really get out of the way or attempt to defend themselves, and will be completely helpless when building a structure.   Structure building is the usual branching tree of increasingly complex and expensive needs, and each building will offer an improvement you can purchase that relates to it. The windmill, for example, will enable your peasants to dig irrigation ditches to improve crop yield. In a fort, you can train your troops to give them combat and defense bonuses. All of these come at a not-insignificant cost and take time to complete, but you'll usually have plenty of resources to go around and will be able to regain what you've lost. If not, you have multiple difficulty levels to choose from until you find the right one that challenges you without frustrating you. However, there are simply so many improvements to choose from that you won't know where to spend your time and money, and only experimentation on the battlefield and potentially humiliating attacks on your home base will allow you to separate the necessary improvements from the luxurious.    And those attacks will come and catch you off-guard, even on the lowest difficulty setting. Rival tribes and roving wildlife will put a serious dent in your progress if you don't baby-sit your base with a large contingent of troops both patrolling outside buildings and defending within. Since bears and bison do an inordinate amount of damage, you'll have to stick with the more expensive but relatively fragile ranged units. But then you'll also need infantry to defend ranged units against a large human threat.   Every part of the map is a potential battlefield with few choke points to reduce the cost of weighing down your base with defenses. Some enemies will periodically spawn from an indestructible structure and hassle you throughout the mission (or extort you in exchange for uneasy peace). So you won't be able to linger for too long on any map, unless you want the spawners to grind you down through slow attrition. Your major enemy on the map, however, is usually a much larger worry, so don't dilly-dally!   Yes, you will have to read the manual in order to get a handle on the more complex elements, like the details of structure defense and shot power. There's a tutorial, but it's only one map and it will wait for you to do certain things to trigger the educational bits, instead of guiding you smoothly along. You'll need the manual in order to know that the sides of buildings where the windows are will be dangerous, and that projectile damage is greatly affected by range. Unfortunately, this isn't a jump-in-and-play kind of experience you'll get with most other RTSs these days (at least after running through a polished tutorial), and that will create some frustration and confusion for casual genre gamers. Your ranged units don't automatically get in as close to melee targets as they could, even though they it would mean a faster kill with fewer rounds of ammo.    There are other problems with unit management, as might be expected when dealing with such large numbers. You can lose a few units here and there, and not be able to find them in the foliage, forcing you to click-and-drag highlight the whole screen and click somewhere to make them come out of hiding. A larger problem, however, is managing separate groups of the same type of unit and keeping peasants separate from combat units. Double-clicking on a unit selects every unit of that type, so you'll have some trouble if you want to do some manual flanking, since they will move as one by default. You can click and drag, but they're grouped so tightly together that you're bound to accidentally net units of another type and thereby weaken their own formation. Although you can't expect war to be all nice and organized, ideally this should be because of what the enemy is doing, instead of what the interface makes it difficult for you to do.  American Conquest: Fight Back is still a solid game which manages to combine RTS realtime tactics with wargame strategy satisfyingly. Unfortunately, the wargame complexity requires a certain degree of unit and structure-building micromanagement which will appeal more to the dedicated RTS player or wargamer, rather than someone looking for a fun genre game that distinguishes itself with an additional layer of realism. The package never completely gels into a consistently entertaining and satisying experience. Also, we noticed that registration for online games was in German, which kind of puts a crimp in that.", "date": "Oct 14, 2003"}
