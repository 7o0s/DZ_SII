This was probably more evident than ever with the release of last year's abysmal Sammy Sosa's High Heat Baseball 2001, which featured some of the most disgusting graphics that has ever graced the system and didn't quite have the gameplay to make up for it.   The only thing that 3DO's previous baseball game going for it was that it was probably the most statistically accurate game of hardball on PlayStation and was loaded with so many of the features that hardcore purists look for in a baseball videogame. And it's this area, where High Heat Baseball 2002 is even more impressive than it has ever been on a console.   If you're one of those gamers that believe that stats and realism is more important than gameplay, then this just might be the game you're looking for. High Heat 2002 comes complete with the largest feature set and range of customization around. Beyond just the basic Exhibition, Season, and Playoff modes, the game also features a very important and highly usable batting practice mode that gives users a chance to use any of the game's hitters against any available pitcher and practice against any specific variety of pitches and pitch locations. It's a very simple mode, but it's very useful in learning to become an effective hitter in the game.   Furthermore, the season play can be customized to the user's specific liking and there's in depth options that go well beyond just the number of games and playoff formats. For users that like to take part in fantasy drafts, the game lets you start the season with a standard, snake or random draft, in addition to the regular end of 2000 or beginning of 2001 rosters. The drafts are setup nicely so that it's easy to see the best available players at each position in addition to seeing your team's specific needs.   And in a feature that's been carried over from High Heat's critically acclaimed PC counterpart, the game's core elements, such as running speed, fielder speed, throwing speed, fastball speed, and so on, can be tweaked to the user's liking. While some scoff at these kinds of sliders, suggesting that it's the job of the developers to tune the gameplay, it's nice to have the power to make the game play exactly like I want it to.   For example, if you find that hitting is a little bit too easy and want to up the challenge, it's possible to up the speed of the fastballs, while slowing down the speed of the off-speed pitches, thus creating a situation where it's much easier for you to get fooled by an opposing pitcher changing speeds on you. And beyond this, it's entirely possible that you might find that the developers have set certain aspects of the game to your liking and the sliders give you a chance to fix this.  Gameplay When you get right down to the core gameplay, things aren't quite as rosy it is with the game's features set. The batting interface seems a bit archaic, and even though I can completely forgive the lack of a cursor or option to have a cursor, there are other problems that aren't quite as defensible. The batting is pretty simple in that you just simply have the option to swing with the X button or bunt by pressing the Y button and the direction of your swing is determined by where you press the digital pad.   The problem that I have with this is that pressing away from your batter to go for an outside pitch switches the player into a closed stance, while the opposite direction opens his stance. This just isn't how it works in real baseball and for a game that relies so heavily on being a simulation for purists, it's quite a problem. Choosing an open, close or normal stance should be more of a pre-pitch option and only the direction of the swing should be affected the digital pad's movement once the ball is on the way to plate.   You should also be warned that the learning curve for being successful at hitting is pretty steep and it's almost a requirement that you use the batting practice mode to get your bearings. It's hard to tell if it's just because the game was made challenging or the graphical limitations of the game make it harder to judge the depth and location of the pitch, but the bottom line is that you're going to have to work at getting good at hitting on the harder settings.   While I have some reservations about the hitting mechanics, I'm enthralled by the raw variety of types of hits off of the bat. The ball physics in High Heat 2002 are better than any other baseball game on PlayStation and the variety of types of hits that you'll see over the course of a season is pretty impressive. You'll get everything from lazy grounders, infield pop-ups, hard hit grounders up the middle, foul tips, to Baltimore Chops. The only type of hit that seemed to happen too infrequently were foul pop-ups that stayed in the field of play.   Pitching is one of the game's strongest points mainly because this is one of the few baseball titles that don't limit pitchers to only four pitches. While the majority of Major League pitchers don't have more than four pitches, there are some that do and it takes away from the game's authenticity if you have a pitcher with five different pitches be limited to only four in the game. And for the pitchers that 3DO didn't correctly tag, the game has an edit player option that allows users to adjust the attributes of every player in the game and even add, change or subtract pitches from a player's arsenal.   If you want to get picky, though, the game could use some more pitches, as it only has the basic fastball, curve, slider, change up, knuckle, split-finger, sinker, forkball, and screwball, and doesn't have a four-seam or two-seam specific fastball or odd pitches like  Mussina's Knuckle-curve or something like the circle change. However, while we're on the subject of overly anal details, High Heat 2002 is the only game of this year's crop of baseball titles that I've notice include the 12-to-6, overhand curveball, which is thrown by people like Aaron Sele (and my old-favorite, Greg Olsen, who I'm not sure is even in baseball anymore).   Moving on, the computer AI is both one of the game's strongest and weakest points. On the plus side, you won't find a game with opposing pitchers or batters that act as realistically. The computer controlled pitchers will actually waste pitches when ahead of the count and batters will work the count for walks and take pitches when the count in 3-0. Conversely, I've seen some horrible baserunning decisions by the CPU on the base paths. The most common of which is just going for an extra base when it's just not plausible, such as tagging up and running home on a very short fly ball that nobody in their right mind would ever attempt to run on. I've also noticed that the runner on first won't get a good jump in situations when there's two outs and he should be running, thus resulting in some two out singles to right field where the runner won't make it to third base.  Graphics Whereas the gameplay has some redeeming qualities, there's not really anything that can be said about the game's visual that's positive except that it's much improved over that crap we were shoveled last year. The player models are deformed and their faces, which you'll see during replays and between innings, are downright scary. The problem with the player models is that they are made up of irregular shapes and are oddly proportioned.   The players seem to only have two different body types and each have shoulders that are much too round, much too big and strangely attached to their bodies. The animation is also quite weak and player movement is typically chopping and lacking in frames of animation. The only saving grace in this category is the fact that it has a solid 30 frames per second framerate.   Sound Last year's play-by-play in Sammy Sosa's High Heat Baseball 2001 was arguably some of the worst in the history of sports videogames. Luckily, 3DO realized this and has replaced last year's crappy solo announcer with a two-man booth featuring Dave O'Brien, the Florida Marlins announcer, and Ray Fosse, the color commentator with the Oakland A's. The commentary isn't going to blow you away and is typically pretty dry, but it's quality stuff that's general right on target with what's happening in the game. The crowd noises are pretty good and home crowds will make more noise when something goes right for the home team and the general sound effects are sufficient. For those of you that decided to forgo all of the above text and skip right to the bottom, High Heat 2002 is probably the best baseball simulation available on PlayStation. Casual fans will probably get more out of Triple Play Baseball because it has a simpler learning curve and is a more playable game. But, people that want all of the little details that happen in real baseball to happen in their videogame, then High Heat is the way to go. It's not a perfect simulation and does have some inadequacies as a sim, but it's still the best of its kind on PlayStation.", "date": "Mar 7, 2001"}
