That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.    You don't know how lucky you are.  In taking a look back at Populous, I found myself writing a ponderous treatise about its theological implications.  But at some point after looking up the spelling of ~transcendent~ (it's E-n-t, not A-n-t), it occurred to me you can only analyze a game so far before you sound silly and pretentious.  So I deleted it and started over, because the appeal of Populous is very simple.  Gaming is about being powerful; what could be more powerful than a god?  This is an idea that Peter Molyneux and Glenn Corpes played with at Bullfrog, the company they helped found (ten years later, Molyneux left for Lionhead Studios and Corpes went to Lost Toys).  They began with Populous, a simple and sophisticated game in which two growing populations clashed while opposing gods watched over them and occasionally reached their divine fingers into the action.  It is an idea as old as Ancient Greece, when gods quarreled by proxy using mortal kings and armies; the Trojan War was essentially a slap fight between bickering goddesses.  It is fitting that Populous II, the fruition of their idea, was loosely based on the pantheon of Greek gods.  The first Populous was fairly limited in terms of interface and gameplay.  The bulk of the player's time was spent terraforming a 3D landscape.  A colony of reproducing worshippers generated mana; the more worshippers, the more mana, and thus the more divine powers you could use.  In the parlance of the real time strategy games that eventually grew from Populous, worshippers were at once your resource and your units.  The sprawling interface didn't seem very well thought out and there were only six divine powers.  But the idea was unique, thrilling and addictive.  I spent many hours clutching a Sega Genesis controller smoothing out my people's side of the world two steps high and waiting for enough mana to invoke a flood, a surefire tactic to wipe out evil on most of the game's worlds.    In Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods, Bullfrog really fleshed the idea out, polished the interface, and slowly ramped it up for new players.  There was more to do and see.  You still spent a lot of time terraforming, but there were new powers (called Divine Intervention Effects), better graphics, and an ongoing role playing aspect as your god learned new powers and squared off against more powerful gods over new worlds.  You could even play multiplayer games over a modem or network.  It did well enough that there was even an expansion pack.  Powermonger, a more earthly, ambitious, and confused version was released a few months later.  By the time the third Populous was released with the ungracious subtitle ~The Beginning~, Molyneux and Corpes were no longer at the helm.  Instead, the popularity of Warcraft and Command & Conquer drove the development process and the end result bore only a superficial resemblance to the games that inspired it.  It was, instead, an almost entirely conventional real time strategy game about drag selecting units and clicking on your target.  But the unique paradox of Populous is that you are not an omnipotent god.  You do not hand down orders which will be followed by automatons.  You can influence your people, but you do not control them.  You guide them.  You help strike down their enemies.  You make life easier for them.  And they, in turn, give you the power you need to help them.  It's a strangely symbiotic relationship, a sort of cosmic co-dependence.  The only other game brave enough to attempt this strange model of interaction is Cyberlore's brilliant and underrated Majesty, which is more of an heir to Molyneux's and Corpes' ideas than anything they've done since Populous II.  Although the specifics for Molyneux's next game, Black & White, are still a little hazy, it looks like it will have more in common with Populous than his disappointing Dungeon Keeper games.  The appeal of being a god over the worlds of Populous is twofold: first there is the satisfaction of bringing order out of chaos.  A typical game of Populous begins with a few people in huts scraping out a living on a rocky mountainous island.  Your godly hand reaches down and smoothes the world into stretches of fertile plain.  You sink rocks into the water and raise new land from the depths.  Your people prosper and build towns and castles where there was once just a rough wasteland.  The second, and perhaps more important appeal of Populous is the sadistic thrill of divine cruelty.  Just as children will take a magnifying glass to an anthill, there is some twisted part of human nature that enjoys thrusting a volcano up through the middle of a city, anointing a crusader to rampage through villages, and smashing columns of flame into pastoral countrysides.  If there's anything more fun that building a sandcastle, it's knocking a sandcastle down.  Populous II holds up very well after seven years.  The basic interface, which is supposed to look like some sort of Olympian workshop on high, isn't terribly practical.  A full screen option opens the viewing area and makes better use of the 640x480 resolution.  The game ramps up slowly -- perhaps too slowly for modern gamers who demand immediate gratification, since you have to play through a conquest mode to unlock new powers before you can use them in a custom game.  It will be a while before you can play with the tidal waves and rains of fire.  As for the actual gameplay, I was surprised to find that I had much more control over the world than I recalled.  This is mainly because the worshippers in Populous behave pretty predictably, based on the ~influence behavior~ commands you can use.  And it's amazing how much you can accomplish with a lone papal magnet, the holy artifact that your people will follow when you ask them.  On the earlier levels, it's a lot of fun wreaking holy havoc with impunity. But once you reach the harder levels, Populous can get ugly -- it's a pretty rude surprise when you find yourself on the receiving end of the divine wrath you've been flinging around.  For the casual player, Populous II can be simple and gratifying.  But for someone looking for a real challenge, this is a game that hits back.  Populous II seems like it would be an excellent multiplayer game, but I wasn't able to get it running on a LAN.  It seems the game's seven-year-old networking code was written for Novell or 3Com networks that require something called a shared folder.  If anyone has any idea how to get this to work in a contemporary networking environment, please email me.  It's surprising and disappointing there haven't been more titles like Populous.  Perhaps gamers aren't ready for this sort of carefully limited interactivity; witness some of the blundering reviews of Majesty.  But part of the last appeal of Populous is that there's no other game quite like it.  And these days, that's one of the highest forms of praise you can offer any game.  -- Tom Chick Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Presentation  The shell screens are eyesores and the default interface doesn't leave much room for the actual map.   4.0  Graphics  Ouch.  I didn't remember them being this bad.    7.0  Sound  Very limited bleeping that won't even work on some newer sound cards.   2.0  Gameplay  ~You ask me if I have a God complex?  Let me tell you something.  I am God.~   9.0  Lasting Appeal  The concept of building up your god by learning new divine interventions goes a long way.   9.0  Should I Go Back and Play It?  Unique games like this are too few and far between.  YES  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   8.0 It's surprising and disappointing there haven't been more titles like Populous.
