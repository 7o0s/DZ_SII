His original debut on consoles in late 2001 was an uninspired action adventure title based on DreamWorks' parody of all things Disney. Shrek suffered from the same gaping pit that traps so many movie-to-game licenses -- it was rushed to coincide with the movie, without any thought to content or playability.   However, as it is with all popular franchises these days, Shrek recently spawned a sequel in the form of Shrek 2. Fortunately, Shrek 2 stars a new developer/publisher cast. Hoping to shake the first videogame's bad image, Activision assigned Luxoflux (True Crime) to the task of crafting the new Shrek experience. The end product is a surprisingly fun and decent action adventure game -- at least on consoles. You can read about it right here. Don't be fooled. The PC title has nothing in common with its console brethren besides for similar storyline elements and characters. Gone is the multiple character dynamic, the multiplayer mode, decent production values, interesting (if not particularly hard) puzzles, humorous mini-games, and most things that you'd associate with Shrek 2. Instead, PC gamers have a game that belongs in Shrek's swamp rather than an optical drive. Shrek 2 loosely follows the plot of the film. Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey set out on a journey to visit the in-laws in Far, Far Away Land. However, due to Shrek's ogre-ish nature,  a family fights ensues. It's up to Shrek to find a happy ending for his bride. The game presents a very brief outline of the movie's story and chooses to take a few liberties with events and locals (as one would expect). Theoretically designed as a children's title, Shrek 2 isn't very complex. In fact, your actions consist solely of running, jumping, or smashing objects. That sums up the Shrek 2 experience. There's no substance, only constant clicking of the mouse button.  The GoodYou get to play as three different characters: Shrek,Donkey, and Puss in Boots.You ride around on a giant gingerbread man. This entailskicking knights and throwing trolleys at bridges whilst avoiding milk bombs.It's quite amusing.The final boss fight entails stunning the Fairy Godmotherwith reflected magic spells and then throwing watermelon, corn, and tomatoes ather to deplete her health bar. It's extremely easy and silly. Witnessing theabsurdity of it all is your only reward for finishing the game.The game is only two hours long.The BadThe controls can't be configured. There is no controllersupport. You're forced to use WASD and the left and right mouse buttons. Theleft button attacks -- you click it so often you'll feel like you'replaying Diablo (except without having any fun). The rightbutton jumps. Correctly timing a double jump, which requires an instantaneousdouble tap, isn't easy to perform with the control setup.The gameplay is incredibly easy and repetitive. There is nodifficulty curve. Just click the left mouse button to kill everyone around you.Platforming is a pain due to the control scheme. Levels are primarily the same-- constant attacking and jumping. There are hardly any puzzles (and those thatexist are of the ~find item or switch~ or ~kill allenemies~ variety).Throughout the game, Shrek and company collect coins. Thesecan be used to purchase potions, which can turn your foes into frogs, make themfall asleep, stop them with stench, shrink them, or transform them intofriends. These can also be used to make you invisible to enemy eyes. But, younever have to use them. It's actually easier to just punch enemies to death.Besides for physical appearance and movement speed, there isno real difference between playable characters (except Puss can climb poles andDonkey can kick stuff).Textures are very bland and stretched. Animations areoccasionally awkward (did you know horses could strafe?). Shrek and companywill often pull themselves up on invisible ledges or fail to grab pipes or ziplines. Clipping is also a problem.The UglyThe camera will make you want to vomit. While the camera isfairly standard (it's connected to your mouse movement), it suffers from anausea-inducing delay.The voice acting is atrocious -- characters barely resembletheir movie counterparts. Delivery is extremely stilted. The dialogue is poorlywritten and doesn't even sound like what the characters would say.KnowWonder liberally applied padding to Shrek 2.You'll have to fight your way out of the same areas two or three times (oncewith each character) with little change to the physical environment. You'lleven have to watch the same cut scene from multiple viewpointsAs you might infer from the handy list, Shrek 2 doesn't contain many positive attributes. It's really really bad. There's simply no other way to describe this product. In fact, playing it makes me like the movie less.The combat is insanely repetitive and easy. Besides for visual diversity, there's no reason for Shrek 2 to possess multiple characters or spells. The only difficult part of the game, besides for hoping your stomach survives the extremely bumpy ride (especially when you control the giant gingerbread man), is a battle with Puss in Boots. That's simply because the trick to defeating him is so easy it's counterintuitive. Having played through Shrek 2 on the consoles, I'm really surprised by the quality presented in the PC title. Shrek 2 lacks anything that could be called substance or fun. Between collision glitches that continually prevent you from making jumps, a horrible camera, boring and repetitive gameplay, and shoddy production values, Shrek 2 can't be  recommended to anyone. Frustration caused by the controls and camera will plague children, and adults will be bored by Shrek 2's simplicity. It isn't even intentionally funny.If you crave an interactive version of the movie, pick up a copy of Shrek 2 for GameCube, PlayStation 2, or Xbox. Don't play the PC title -- unless you happen to get it for free and enjoy mocking bad games...and even then wasting two hours on it is a tough call.", "date": "Jun 7, 2004"}
