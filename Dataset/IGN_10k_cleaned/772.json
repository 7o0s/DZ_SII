But when you can't even do that properly, it's time to rethink your Game Boy development strategy. Xantera developed Test Drive 6 on the Game Boy last year, and it certainly had its fair share of problems that made it look like an amateur production. Problem is, that's not the last we saw of it -- Test Drive Off-Road 3, an off-roading racing game,  uses the identical graphics engine of Test Drive 6, right down to the exact same interface to start a race. A sloppy racing game will always be a sloppy racing game, no matter what vehicles you use. Features Ten licensed vehicles 24 tracks Battery save For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  There are three distinct differences between Test Drive 6 and Test Drive Off-Road 3. One, the perspective. Instead of a pseudo-angled viewpoint, the camera is now straight down at the roofs of the vehicles. The second difference, there's a lot more jumps  Test Drive 6 had its fair share of them in the middle of the road, but some of the courses in Test Drive Off-Road 3 actually cut across obstacles (like the Pyramids in Egypt). And three, the vehicles. Obviously, the game has to have four-wheeling cars in it. So, we've got Jeeps, Hummers, Dodges, and Subarus. Not exactly the fastest thing on wheels, which makes this game a little worse for wear.  And since the rest of the game is shamelessly identical, I'm just going to shamelessly cut-and-paste the rest of the review from the one I wrote last year for Test Drive 6.  The scrolling speed is way too slow. Even at the higher levels where you earn faster options or vehicles, the game never really gets to a pace where you feel a sense of speed. Second, the amount of frames of animation for each car is way too low  when you turn left or right, the sloppy animation is painfully obvious since each incremental angle of the car jumps and jerks from one frame to the next.   The computer AI is also very annoying  the three other cars pose absolutely no threat in the early cups, but then suddenly earn super human driving abilities when you manage to lead the pack in the later Tournament cups. The animation of these vehicles looks like you're playing the game on a slow PC network  just watch the cars jerk around the track like you're bogged down by lag. The irony of it all is that even though it looks like it could be networked, this game doesn't even support the link cable for two players, an absolute necessity in racing games nowadays.   The game features 10 licensed cars, but there's no way these cars drive like the real-life counterpart. I'm not going to cut points for this (even though the Test Drive series was all about attention to detail in handling, speed, acceleration, etc) since there'd really be no way to keep track of realistic handling in this type of racing game.    The only thing this game has over the last one is the rumble cartridge  and even this doesn't make the game worth owning. There are plenty of top-down racers better than this one, and the cream of the crop is Micro Machines Twin Turbo. Leave this one alone.", "date": "Mar 10, 2000"}
