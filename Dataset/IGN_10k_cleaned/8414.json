Of course, if you want someone to blame for the fact that the now newly-monikered iteration has taken - let's see - a whopping seven months to get here then may we kindly point you in the direction of Nintendo and Konami.   Of course, delays in Europe are hardly a new thing and, ordinarily, we probably wouldn't bother mentioning it (unless say, we're talking of GameCube Animal Crossing proportions, obviously). However, as they say, we've got a problem here. You see, Eledees (formerly known as Elebits), appeared as a launch title on Nintendo's new console in both Japan and the US way, way back in November.   As fun as Eledees is, its Wiimote novelties have faded slightly.  At the time, our American cousins were still giddy in the head over the Wii's new-fangled control mechanism and, kudos to Konami, Eledees manages to exploit the Wiimote's unique functions superbly well. Trouble is, seven months in, minus that initial novelty-born enthusiasm, we're a little more discerning in our gaming tastes. Let's take a step back for a minute though.   For reasons we're not entirely sure about (mainly because the beautifully illustrated cutscenes are so atrociously, gratingly voice-acted, we skipped them at the first opportunity), Eledees sees you wielding a 'Capture Gun' in a bid to round up the camera-shy, electricity generating titular critters. Viewed from first-person perspective, the nunchuck controls forward/backward/strafe movement, while the Wii's remote is used to move the targeting reticule around the screen, plus adjusting your viewpoint left, right, up and down. As has been the case from the beginning with game's using this set-up, it's perfectly adequate, if not quite as lightening responsive as we might like.   As your gun becomes more powerful you can start chucking heavy stuff around.  Eledees' gimmick though is that your Capture Gun has the power not only to capture your miniature foes with the twitch of a trigger, but also shift around and interact with objects in your immediate environment. In your quest to locate and requisition enough Eledees to fulfil each level's wattage quotient, you'll gradually power up your gun - via yellow and pink Power Eledees - increasing the total weight it's capable of hoisting in the air. Really, it's this that provides the game's hook - while initially, you can just about manage to pluck a hanky in the air, pretty soon you'll be chucking wardrobes and cars around the place, creating massively satisfying carnage.   Full credit to Konami too - twisting doorknobs to enter new rooms, sliding open drawers by jerking the Wiimote back, popping a CD in a player or simply chucking a pot plant at the wall feels completely natural, intuitive and responsive. It's an excellently implemented and surprisingly unique application of the Wii's remote - quite some achievement considering how early on in the console's life cycle the game appeared. Not to mention how most developers seem to have struggle getting to grips with Nintendo's new technology.     Unfortunately, for all its plus points, there's something amazingly slight about Eledees. Ultimately, there's little to the game beyond the hunt and capture mechanics we've already described. Sure, as things progress stiffer criteria are introduced - for instance, you're limited in the number of objects you can break or the amount of noise you make shifting things around - but these merely serve to dampen the reckless joy of mass destruction that makes Eledees so much fun in its early stage.   What's more, despite the promise of various unlockables - ranging from new gameplay modes to new objects for level-building in Edit mode - there just isn't enough variety and deviation from the basic shoot-and-fling mechanics to keep things interesting. It doesn't take long before the constant repetition becomes a chore.   Eledees like to hide absolutely everywhere - in a box, behind a lamp... in the toilet.  Sadly, the limited four-person multiplayer game proves short-lived too, failing to illicit much excitement, despite the chaotic scramble for Eledees. However, one area we've got nothing but praise for is the aforementioned Edit mode. As you complete levels in Story mode, new areas are unlocked, which can then be populated with furniture to suit your every Lawrence Llewellyn Bowen-crushing whim. Best of all, these stages - whether serious stabs at self-made gameplay brilliance or impossible, gravity-defying monoliths ripe for destruction - can be shared with your friends via the Wii's much-touted, but largely neglected WiiConnect24 service. It's a brilliant touch and an addition worthy of recognition.Theres much to praise with Eledees  most notably, the games excellent implementation of the Wiis control scheme. Its a set-up that finally offers something that simply wouldnt be possible on any other system  and, thankfully, its an intrinsically woven aspect of Eledees gameplay rather than a casual afterthought. Trouble is, for all the environmental interaction and satisfyingly reckless destruction it offers, there just isnt enough game-wise to support it. For all its off-kilter charm, Eledees is simply too shallow an experience to hold attention for extended periods of time. Its a shame because Konami really pulled out all the stops to make the most of the Wiis unique feature set  particularly impressive given Eledees original launch game status. Sadly though, now that the initial novelty of the Wiimotes worn off, Eledees shortcomings  despite being undoubtedly unique and engaging - are all too obvious.", "date": "Apr 27, 2007"}
