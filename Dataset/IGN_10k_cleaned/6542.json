Something that hearkens back to those old DOS days of simple but fun adventuring, with aliens and spaceships and galaxy-threatening nemeses. And on paper, Space Hack does offer a lot of Cool Stuff. It's a dungeon hack (hence the name) that most closely resembles Diablo, but it's done in fully rotateable, isometric 3D. For twenty bucks, it's not a bad-looking game, although its limited North American distribution will make it hard to find outside of GameStop and its partners. Trust me, I've Googled it. And its familiar mechanics makes it easy to jump into and play. Unfortunately, some awkward design decisions can kill immersion, and the 45 levels of the game adhere too closely to ~more is better.~   Space Hack is the name of our hero, a prisoner on a ship full of prisoners being sent to a prison. Imagine that! He got his name from boarding and clearing out a Martian pirate ship, armed with nothing more than a machete, which he apparently used to chop his would-be attackers into little juicy bits. But he won't be going to jail any time soon, because the ship has gotten caught in a nebula and invaded by some extremely hostile aliens. It's an enormous vessel, with dozens of different biospheres and ecologies, but the variety of the content is stretched pretty thinly. Space Hack takes its sweet time, frankly, introducing new elements, to the point where you get pretty freakin tired of seeing the same two or three beasts advancing toward you with maniacal bloodlust. No, you can't expect award-winning presentation for twenty bucks, but I'd simply prefer less game that's good, rather than lots of game that's mediocre.     You see, although the environments look good, and the music is actually surprisingly engaging for a budget title, the control scheme is awkward and weapon deterioration is simply out of control. You use the mouse for both targeting and navigation, and there's no way to lock on to anything. You'll be dealing with lots of enemies that like to use projectiles, and mini-boss enemies that have a ton of hit points and dish out two- and three-hit kills. Basically, you will be dodging and retreating the overwhelming majority of the time. There's the option to be a melee fighter, but I really can't see how that's feasible. They come in waves, they don't back off, and healing oneself is a surprisingly expensive proposition. Health packs are relatively hard to come by in the field, and relatively expensive to buy. You can get gadgets that allow you to heal yourself, but all they do is save a few inventory slots, since they have a limited number of charges that cost about as much to refill as it does to simply buy a health pack. There are free and unlimited heath stations peppered throughout the ship, but they're few and far between. You can get healed for free in the town, but that requires heading back to town just to heal yourself.   Adding fuel to the fire of irritation is exorbitant repair cost and rapid weapon deterioration. One dungeon session (basically the amount of time it takes to fill up your inventory with loot) will almost destroy whatever weapon you're using (unless it's an energy weapon, which constantly drains your energy supply and requires skill points that you might want to use elsewhere. Ironically, you need this energy supply as currency, which makes using energy weapons an ambiguous proposition). Repairing a weapon that's almost destroyed costs nearly as much as buying a new one outright. This makes sense, but it becomes a real hassle when your stuff is falling apart at an alarming rate. Compounding the problem is the fact that the areas you go through don't get re-populated with enemies; since the only way to get energy is from cells that the enemies drop, you're faced with a finite cash supply and an expensive combat model. Armor doesn't get beat up nearly as fast. In fact, I was upgrading to new stuff far faster than the old stuff needed to be repaired. Then again, I wasn't getting hit a lot as a ranged fighter, so your mileage may vary.   Space Hack has so many design elements in common with Diablo -- permanent waypoints that teleport you back to the town hub, temporary waypoints you can buy, free heals from the town doctor, selling loot at a fraction of its value, repairing items, identifying items even some of the costs are the same: 100 credits to identify an item, and 100 credits for the standard health pack. It's a classless game, however, meaning that you'll start as a generic weakling and put points into different attributes to complement your play style. And there is no talent tree, just arbitrary skill requirements for a given item. The loot table also isn't quite as tight as it could be, as I snatched up swords, helmets, and whatnot that were hours ahead of my current skill level. At least identifying an item is never a gamble -- you're almost always guaranteed to get your money back on the sale. I can't tell you how many worthless Boots of Light I picked up in Diablo that you could hardly trade for belly button lint. However, like Diablo, even a halfway decent modifier escalates repair costs dramatically, which stinks when the modifier isn't particularly useful for you. Lastly, there is very little armor variety, which means your dude will have essentially the same look for hours at a time.   Space Hack, to me, is an example of why it's often better to focus on quality rather than sheer quantity. Like the difference between a glass of Fernet Branca and a six pack of Natural Ice. The game also crashes randomly sometimes, and sometimes fails to load, in addition to the aforementioned design decisions. So if you're hard up for an action-RPG and don't want to spend much money, Space Hack will offer diversion, but it won't hearken back to days of yore so much as it will make you wish you were playing those games instead.", "date": "Jan 7, 2006"}
