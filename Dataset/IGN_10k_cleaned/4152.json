An online first-person shooter on a huge, persistent-world scale. It was not without some teething problems, however. As much of a blast as it was to play, PS was riddled with bugs, lag and instability. The novelty and fun of it, however, managed to survive these ailments. What hobbled PS in the long run, however, was how quickly the tides of war could change. Your faction could grab hold of an entire continent, taking all day to vanquish your foe--and then you would log on the next day only to find that same continent completely secured by the same enemy you'd plowed through the day before, or even hours before.   It's a much more stable game now, however, and some significant tweaks have been put into place to make defense last longer and base capping a matter of CTF rather than sitting around for a base timer cap to wind down to zero. Core Combat adds some further twists that can create an impressive fortress of any base. It's too bad that the cavern maps themselves are virtual wastelands, but we'll get to that in a moment.   You'll have six caverns with the expansion pack, connected to six continents on Auraxis. Only two of these caverns will be accessible at any given time. You can get to them via a warpgate, and two gates are placed on each connecting continent.   Unfortunately, the cavern warpgates are almost always in the middle of nowhere, so if you're already on the ground, it's a bit of a pain to get underground. However, you can drop from the HART transport and will be able to select a drop point that's right nearby. It's probably better this way anyway--driving into the cavern is an exercise in patience, because it's really only geared towards foot traffic and flying vehicles. It's a cramped place, and there are no roads, only lots of sheer dropoffs.   Cavern transportation is provided by ~ziplines,~ statically-placed glowing cords that move a soldier rapidly from point to point. There are dozens and dozens in each cavern, but they don't ever go conveniently to where you need to go.    The point of the cavern is to acquire a Vortex Module, which you can take to the generator room of a surface base and install to give that base various benefits like rapid respawn, faster foot movement, extra health, a base shield, and the ability to get Ancient Tech vehicles at a surface base vehicle pad.   In order to gain a module, you have to acquire a special box at the top floor of a ~Stasis~ base, which you'll usually find at opposing ends of a cavern. Once you get the box, you have to take it to the center base and charge it up, which takes a while and leaves you vulnerable to attack.    Did I mention the ziplines aren't very intuitive? This is a major sticking point. Sometimes you'll zip over to what turns out to be a dead end, or you end up at a base attached to ziplines that go in every direction but the one you want to go. Sometimes moving from line to line is a few feet, other times you have to jump through a warp pad or hop off a cliff in order to get to the next one. There's an excessive amount of planning required. ~Let's see, if I head over to that base, I see I can take a zip to that other one, if I run through the inside and go out that door.~    Hope you don't run into an enemy, because if he takes you down and your faction hasn't secured a Stasis base, then you can't respawn anywhere underground, unless someone dragged an AMS along (a truck that can stealth itself and allow you to spawn and arm yourself).   Unfortunately, traveling through the caverns is a hum-drum affair, because they are almost always empty, even though only two are open at any given time and the place is about a third of the size of the average continent. Part of the reason for the vacancy is that you don't actually have to go into a cavern to get a module. You can actually steal one from an enemy base, or kill an enemy who's carrying one and take it from him. You can benefit from the modules without using the expansion, although you won't be able to use the Ancient Tech weapons or vehicles.   Which is another thing. The weapons aren't too useful, for a few reasons. One, they aren't compelling replacements to what you can already get, and two, you can only get more ammunition by finding a recharge crystal...permanently placed underground. The caverns are dotted with glowing crystal formations that heal you, repair your armor, and refill your AT weapons, but, as the caverns are such a disorienting place, those crystals aren't easy to track down.   There's a Medium Assault weapon called the Radiator that creates a small, temporary radioactive zone causing continuous damage, and another one called the Spiker that's the equivalent of a Faction pistol, but the only arguably useful one is the Maelstrom (Heavy Assault class), which creates a lighting bolt in its primary mode that has good damage and creates a little splash damage like the Vanu Sovereignty's (VS) Lasher--but is no replacement for it, not even counting the ammunition problem. The secondary mode fires lashing grenades, but the Rocklet and the Thumper are better choices for accuracy and damage.   The Maelstrom would be most useful for the New Conglemerate, whose heavy assault weapon has no medium or long-range capability to speak of. Although the VS's Lasher doesn't fare to well at longer ranges either, the availability of actual ammunition and the distracting effect of its projectiles edges the Maelstrom out of competition.    The vehicles fare a little better. The Flail in particular is a handy vehicle. It's a mobile artillery platform with an unbelievable range--so far, in fact, that you have to have teammates paint targets for you with a ~laze~ pointer. It takes up a pistol slot and takes a few seconds to use, though, and the painted waypoint only lasts for a few seconds. And the artillery shots are painfully slow and given to lots of splash damage that can do just as much damage to your faction as to the enemy. However, the Flail is excellent for destroying base turrets and vehicle pad terminals from miles away. It's also quite useful for suppressing enemies defending a tower.   The Router allows you to warp a short distance. You park the Router, then place a Telepad to create a destination for the warp. It's a two-way connection, though, so you have to place both ends well to keep the enemy from getting behind your line of invasion. The Telepad also takes up a pistol slot. Like the Flail, you can walk up to it and acquire one directly from the vehicle, instead of lugging one all the way from your Sanctuary. The Router can take a good deal of damage, but doesn't move very quickly and can't stealth itself like the AMS, which is a much less complicated vehicle--just park and deploy.    The last one is the Switchblade, a one-man ATV-class vehicle (that hovers like all the Ancient Tech vehicles) and can go full-speed over water. It moves at up to 80kph and is quite maneuverable. You can also ~plant~ it like a Terran Republic MAX unit, giving you a much higher rate of fire in exchange for becoming immobile and reducing your range of turret movement. In fact, once planted, the Switchblade turret only moves on the up-down axis.   Since it can go over water at full speed and weave through trees like a Star Wars speeder bike, though, it is definitely the best ATV-class vehicle in the game, despite the severe drawbacks to planting and firing. Vehicle movement in general is a lot kinder to hovering vehicles in PlanetSide, and it's nice for everyone to have access to an amphibious set of wheels besides the Deliverer, which moves across water like a turtle.   Core Combat is in a tough place: It retails at $30, whether you buy it in the store or download it via the Launchpad; the chief benefits of fighting in the Core--the modules--can be experienced by any player, expansion or no; the modules can also be stolen by anyone; the Telepads, Routers, and Laze Pointers can be used by anyone; the weapons are not a compelling addition to the arsenal; only the Flail stands out, primarily because it filled the artillery niche.   The cavern visuals are nothing to write home about either, unfortunately. Sony went with a Fortress of Solitude theme chock-a-block with enormous crystalline formations. This wouldn't be so bad if everything wasn't so blocky. With PlanetSide's impressive draw distance, however, you have to make some shortcuts in order to keep framerates and lag at reasonable levels. But the compromise creates some unimpressive results.  This is urban? Fighting in the Core is too disorienting and transportation too roundabout to recommend plunking down $30, especially when actual combat in the Core is so infrequent. The caverns are also too impractical to get to and take too long to get out of. You have a fifteen minute timer to take a box from a Stasis station to the center, then to an exit, and it resets when you reach the surface, but it's just more convenient to take someone else's module rather than go get one yourself. Also, every faction can see you on the map while you're carrying a module, so you're a marked man unless you're traveling with a heavy group. You also can't drive any vehicles or warp to your Sanctuary while carrying a module. You also can't ride in a flying vehicle. In a more populated version of the game, these strategic limits would make for some consistently tense fun. Without them, it's just kind of a drag.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
