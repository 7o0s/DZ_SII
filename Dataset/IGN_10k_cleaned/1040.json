We've had Dragon Warrior Monsters that brought hundreds of unique monsters into the mix. We've had Bomberman Max that copied the dual-cartridge format for the ultimate trading. And now, we have Infogrames attempt  a Looney Tunes licensed game that emphasizes the collection of critters. Don't be fooled by the marketing gimmick -- Looney Tunes Collector: Alert! is a great-playing and wonderfully-designed Game Boy Color adventure, but it's definitely not Pokmon.Features47 different Looney Tunes characters to collect15 playable Looney Tunes charactersBattery back-up with three save slotsLink cable support for two player actionOnly for Game Boy ColorWhatever team was assigned to Alert really knows its Looney Tunes  the game features 47 characters from the Warner Bros. backlog of shorts, 15 of which are completely playable. These guys did their homework  there's even a character that was only in a single Chuck Jones-directed cartoon, Mot the baby alien. Remember this guy? Talk about knowing your stuff...Anyway, the story starts out in a great, animated intro with Marvin the Martian and his pup soldier, K-9. Seems this brush-head wants to blow up the earth...again. Cut to Bugs Bunny, who overhears the plans of the martians. What's a rabbit to do? Why, save the world, of course. So it's off on a journey to locate Marvin's ten lost pieces of his teleporter, which is necessary for the guy to blow up the earth. But Bugs can't really do this on his own...he's going to need some help.See, Bugs only has simple abilities, a quick run and a jump. He can bounce on enemies to put them out of commission, but that's not good enough to get through the game's hazards. As he progresses through the linear quest, he'll meet up with Elmer Fudd  after a brief duel and a few bounces to his head, he'll  convince the guy  to join his team. When this happens, he's fully-selectable and playable, and offers abilities that Bugs never had  Elmer can shoot his elephant gun to destroy rocks that block the path. And when Elmer's in control, the other hunters won't bother the guy. Later on Daffy will join the troops, offering the ability to swim deep into water as well as attack with splashes. Witch Hazel will later hop on board, offering a flying ability where needed. It's up to you to figure out these characters abilities, and where their strengths lie in the puzzles that lay before you in this quest.And the quest is a big one -- well-designed, too. It's obvious that the game was written for the younger crowd, for solutions to problems aren't really all that taxing  but the Looney Tunes characters are a timeless bunch. So while the puzzles aren't terribly difficult, there's enough action and exploration to please the older Game Boy Color crowd. I'll definitely admit, this is the best Looney Tunes-based videogame I've played so far.But Infogrames is touting this as a Pokmon-style collecting game, and this really isn't the case. You don't find Looney Tunes in the wild, and it's not a matter of skill and random elements in ~catching them.~ The quest is linear, so the characters in the game are always in the same place at the same time, and you'll ALWAYS convince them to join your squad. There's no hit or miss here. And not all Looney Tunes are playable  some simply just get pushed into a gallery page in a menu option, and all you can do is brag that you've got them. It's simply an indicator on how far you've progressed in the game.That doesn't mean that these captured characters are simply bumps on logs. They can be converted into wager icons if you've got a friend with another copy of the game  find the Cyber Caf and play your friend in minigames for the items wagered. The game has six link-cable minigames, three of which are available outside the regular game. All of these games are simple, and most really aren't worth the effort. You've got a rock-paper-scissors game, a simon-says game, a Pong game...and all of these games have an interface that makes it difficult to tell who actually won. The two-player games were definitely not a heavy focus when this game was designed.Still, Looney Tunes Collector Alert! is a well-designed cartoon game with great graphics, excellent animation, decent music, tight controls, and meticulous attention paid to the Looney Tunes license. And most importantly, this game doesn't seem like a me-too Game Boy game where the developers threw the licensed characters into a generic game  this game was designed from the start as a Looney Tunes game.Infogrames is definitely on a hotstreak  here's a company that's really showing that it cares about quality on the Game Boy Color. Anything can go wrong from here on out, but the last three games out of the company have been of the high quality caliber -- Driver, Wacky Racers, and now Looney Tunes Collector. A good adventure game doesn't have to feature swords, sorcery, dragons and wizards  it can feature a 60 year old Rabbit, as this title proves. It's cute and happy, but it works.", "date": "Jun 22, 2000"}
