Enter Kachinko, the go-go edition of a popular casual game for the PC. It's a cross between pachinko and a match-three puzzler where players shift a row of wells to catch colored balls as they bounce down a peg-filled screen.   The concept is solid. You are essentially trying to draw order from chaos, divvying up these balls as they cascade down the screen one by one at first, later in an absolute deluge. You do earn power-ups from time to time, such as a ball that eliminates an entire column or a wild card ball. And there is a box in the middle of the pegs that, after being hit a few times, explodes into a torrent of balls that helps you line up combos if you moved fast enough.   The ball physics are the one thing that tripped up my enthusiasm. I'm not expecting calculations on par with a console game, but it's almost useless to track a ball as it drops. You're better off just waiting for it to reach the bottom of the screen before deciding where to slot it. And you have a few seconds to move the wells while the ball bumbles along the openings, but it seems inconsistent. Some balls you can juggle for several seconds while others just plunk right in. Maybe the size of the display and resolution is the ultimate culprit, as you cannot tell precisely when the ball has settled enough to drop.   There are four backdrops, although you start the game with only one unlocked. You must complete a specific number of rounds on each board to unlock the next one. The music is actually quite good I didn't feel the need to hit the mute button.  Kachinko is a decent puzzler that probably fares better on the PC because you can see the subtleties of the ball bounces and chart cleaner trajectories. However, this doesn't ruin the game by any stretch. If you like pachinko and haven't tired of the whole match-three puzzle mechanic, there is some fun in Kachinko.", "date": "Oct 3, 2007"}
