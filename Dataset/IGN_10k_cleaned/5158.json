In Kuju Entertainment's new Judge Dredd, based on the famous comic book series and infamous Sylvester Stallone movie, the not-too-distant days ahead are especially craptacular. Crime in the major metropolis Mega City One is so bad that triple threat law enforcement officers like Judge Dredd serve as judge, jury, and executioner when bringing justice to the street. You are Dredd in this game, and you must prove that indeed ~I am the law!~   Features:   Multiple power-ups  Multiple routes through levels  No sign of Sly   Judge Dredd is a pure action game where you are charged with mowing some legions of bad guys armed to the teeth with guns and clubs. Using your ~Lawgiver,~ a handgun that could tear a grizzly bear a new piehole, you must exterminate criminals in a quest to retrieve kidnapped judges like Dredd.   However, even though a name like Judge Dredd implies incessant violence, Kuju gives pacifists a chance to work their own magic. If you get in close to enemies as zing them with your stun gun, you can merely arrest them, rather than execute on the spot. The more arrests, the bigger your end-mission bonus.   But considering the number of ammo types the Lawgiver can carry, it's hardly any fun to arrest bad guys. Why cuff 'em and stuff 'em when you an incinerate them with explosive rounds?   Judge Dredd is fairly straightforward. The majority of the game is spent walking from left to right, clearing out bad guys. There are plenty of environmental hazards, such as exploding barrels and toxic sludge that must be avoided -- but for the most part, this is all bang-bang. The camera placement is above the action at an angle, which actually hinders your ability to dodge bullets at times. It's often difficult, when the action is hot, to think spatially and get in the ~plane~ to avoid gunfire.   Judge Dredd controls fairly well for a cellphone action game. However, we did get to test it on a QD, and games like this tend to benefit from a dedicated d-pad.   Kuju did a pretty solid job on the visuals. Breathtaking? No. But they are above serviceable, and fans will be pleased to see that the Judge is fitted with a nicely sized sprite with decent detail. Levels, however, tend to look the same after a while. There's only so many ways to render a futuristic metropolis in ruin.Judge Dredd is probably a great download for fans, as it does offer up plenty of boom-boom action starring their fave comic criminalist. The game never really ~wows~ on any particular level, but its solid presentation and adherence to the source material are definitely pluses. I liked the multiple types of rounds and the ability to arrest rather than just go on a killing rampage.", "date": "Oct 23, 2004"}
