MotoGP is a popular racing event where the most skilled motorcycle riders from around the globe compete on the some of the most challenging courses and circuits at speeds that often reach 200MPH.   The experience of hurling across a racetrack at 200MPH, hanging onto the back of highly-tuned racing machine such as a Suzuki GSV-R, Yamaha YZR-M1 or a Honda RC211V is more than enough to cause most grown men to soil themselves with a mixture of excitement and pure terror. And while MotoGP allows players to race digital versions of these mechanical monsters, it fails in recreating a similar sense of speed, which results in an experience that more closely matches a trip to Grandma's house on a rusty old beach cruiser.  Features Licensed bikes, riders and racing teams Seven racetracks based on real courses around Europe and Japan Four game modes Track editor Upload and post lap times on the web   MotoGP isn't easy to categorize as an arcade or simulation racer because it doesn't offer fast and simple gameplay, or in-depth realism. While the game does include certain aspects from both arcade and simulation styles, it lacks many of the key elements that make each respective style fun. The simplified control scheme, where players rely solely on acceleration, braking and turning, sadly omits a manual transmission option, which is sure to disappoint many racing fans.   Navigating corners is a tedious process and requires better depth perception, more forgiving controls and a more accurate sense of speed than MotoGP depicts. If not for the helpful arrows that pop up to warn of approaching turns, players would probably be just as successful playing with their eyes closed. Without much in way of roadside objects to help create a sense of speed, players must rely on the tiny speedometer or how hard they crash into the wall to judge their speed.  While there are a handful of different bike models and riders in MotoGP, the only discernable differences are their colors. Tracks suffer from similarity issues as well; each course is visually inseparable regardless of where you are racing. Whether it be Japan, Spain, or the Netherlands, the only major visual difference comes from the ability to choose between sunny, cloudy and rainy weather settings, which unfortunately has no effect on how your bike handles.   Multiplayer and Track Editor are the most interesting modes in MotoGP. A great alternative to racing against the mindless computer opponents is kidnapping a few mindless friends for some multiplayer action, where up to four players can race against one another. If you get tired of racing the same old tracks the simple but fun Track Editor allows you to create and save up to five of your own courses.  MotoGP runs in 3D but the rider and bike models are primitive by PlayStation One standards. The sparseness of landmarks and overall course detail raises the questions; did THQ Wireless fail to tap into the 3D power of the N-Gage, or is this the extent to which the N-Gage can handle 3D racing? The latter possibility should be quite concerning the early adopters of Nokia's highly touted new handheld.  If you are a die-hard racing fan with nowhere else to turn, and you insist on playing MotoGP, heed this one piece of advice: before browsing through the riders and courses and hitting the track, save yourself a headache and mute the sound effects, unless of course, you like the sound of a blender full of rusty nails. The soundtrack on the other hand isn't as bad, but is comprised of fairly generic rock tracks that won't be missed if the game is completely muted. While MotoGP is currently the only available racing game for the N-Gage, we advise half-hearted racing fans to avoid it, and hard-core racers to save their receipts and hope for a lenient return policy. Aside from multiplayer and the simple track editor, there is little excitement to be found due to its lack of variety, poor sense of speed and frustrating controls.", "date": "Dec 18, 2003"}
