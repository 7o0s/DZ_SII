Arriving in a visually updated form this week (the 2005 edition was playable -- but stark), Topolon is a clever puzzler set on a series of circuits. You are tasked with clearing the playing field of bad electrical charges, called Nuruons, by smashing them into each other. Like all good puzzlers, the premise sounds deceptively simple. Ten stages into Topolon, when the game grid starts approximating a complex constellation instead of a small collection of nodes, is when true addiction kicks in.   The circuit is made up of a series of nodes. The nodes are connected to each other by vectors. Some nodes have only one or two vectors, but in later stages, you'll see nodes with five or mode vectors linking them to the rest of the circuit. A series of bad charges exist on these networks and you can move them to neighboring nodes simply by selecting the node with your cursor.   The charges have a handful of forms. The most common are the green sparks, which are destroyed by sending them smashing into each other at a chosen node. If an even number of sparks collide, they vanish. If three collide, one will remain at the node. Clear the circuit of these naughty sparks and you can move on to the next screen. The fewer moves it takes to do this, the more points you are awarded. You'll also earn bonuses for destroying sparks in multiple consecutive turns.   However, matters are further complicated by the evolutionary chain of these charges. When you begin a puzzle, you'll almost always see at least one green charge, but soon red dots appear on the circuit. Red dots, in time, blossom into green sparks. Green sparks, if left alone too long, turn into immovable blue blobs. You cannot smash a red dot into a green spark and destroy them. However, if you manage to clear the blobs and sparks but still have a red dot on-screen, it doesn't count against you -- the level still ends.   Once you get into the rhythm of Topolon, it's hard to stop. There's a definite high when you look at an incredibly complex circuit stretched across your screen, only to finish it off in three quick turns. You find yourself no longer just tapping nodes in hopes of moving charges closer together -- you really start mapping out moves two or three turns in advance.   Topolon has two play modes: Power and Time. Power mode sends you through the circuits to see just how many you can complete. Time sets a clock, and every time to finish a puzzle, seconds are added to the timer.   The original Topolon release was certainly mentally involving, but had the look of an old Atari 2600 game. That was part of its charm, but this 2006 edition, complete with brightly colored sparks set against fractals, starfields, and other compu-imagery looks great. The backdrop is muted enough so that you see it, but it does not interfere with focusing on the circuits and the sparks. The accompanying music is also very, very good.  Upstart Games should be commended for recognizing and bringing this excellent puzzler to a wider audience. I enjoyed the original and have been hooked on this update all week. The game mechanics feel perfectly tuned, with a smart difficulty curve that makes up for some fairly confusing in-game instructions. Trust me, there are hours of replay value in this game. I found myself retrying some of the more aesthetically pleasing puzzles to see if I could do them in fewer moves. If you've played the hell out of Tetris, Gunpey EX, or the other puzzlers you have on your handset and want a fresh, fun brainteaser, make Topolon your next download. Oh, and somebody get this on the Nintendo DS, stat.", "date": "Sep 9, 2006"}
