The only close contender is Matt Grossjean -- and that's only because it sounds like he has dirty pants (I know, I can't believe I wrote that either ... but I could have used Karin Roten instead).  Picabo has it all: a great name, an Olympic gold medal in women's Super G, a kick-ass tiger-print helmet, a big metal plate in her leg ... er, maybe that's not such a great thing ... but she is one step closer to becoming bionic and that's cool.  So why would she want to lend her endorsement to the craptacular Sierra Sports: Skiing?  Maybe she's hard up for money after that big crash in Switzerland.   Now, I'm not saying that Sierra Sports: Skiing 1999 Edition is bad ... that would be a compliment for this game.  It would actually have to get better to suck.  You see a lot of reviews talking about 'game physics' and 'realism in simulations' ...  I dare not even use those phrases in this review as they have no place here.  Skiing '99 totally and utterly ruins the experience of skiing.  You get absolutely no sense of speeding down a mountain in this game and it mainly has to do with the inferior visuals.  I would say that the graphics in the game were piss-poor, but that might imply that there is at least some yellow tinge to the landscape. But this is not the case with Skiing '99.  The only thing here is white, white snow ... whiter than a tea party in Sweden.  I know what you're saying.  ~But Tal, there has to be snow in a skiing game.  What are you, dense?~  Sure, you need snow to ski.  It's not the white stuff itself that looks bad, it's the lack of visual depth ... especially when the snow blends in with the clouds.  You might as well be skiing on a big, flat white plane.  Correction ... you are skiing on a big, flat white plane.  You can't tell if you're going uphill or downhill, you can't see the moguls, and the only objects that offer a break to the monotony are the orange netting that lines the boundaries of the course, the occasional flat-ass tree, and the flags.  Of course, it doesn't help that the skier looks like something you'd find in the margin of a second grader's homework.  What is this ... stick figure skiing?  I kept thinking of the phrase ~when Hell freezes over~ while playing this game, because my own personal Hell would be to play this frosty game for the rest of eternity.  If you travel to Egypt you might see dung beetles rolling Skiing '99 into their burrows.  I think you get my point.  This great is horrendously bad and, even if you love skiing and everything about it, you won't be happy with this one.  As a matter of fact, if you really love skiing, this game may just serve to piss you off.   -- Tal Blevins", "date": "Jan 20, 1999"}
