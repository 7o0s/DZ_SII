Out of his mouth, that's a rave -- the man relates well to maniacal hyperactive little children. Playing through Disney's Stitch: Experiment 626, you can see pretty quickly what Doug ~Captain Insane-O~ Perry got out of the game -- you're a blitzkrieging bopper laying megawatts of laser blasts to every spec of dust that the little blue genetic freak comes across. Glee. However, you may have to be nuts like Doug to really get into the rest of this game.   Gameplay  Playing out as a prequel to Disney's new movie Lilo & Stitch, the game has you playing as Experiment 626 (aka Stitch), a genetically-engineered creature who's creation was in the pursuit of one goal: to create chaos. His 'poppa' is a bit of a mad scientist -- apparently the whole galaxy is full of them -- who has devoted his life to creating an ~indestructible master of mayhem~. Why? To surpass all the other mad scientists racing to create their own anarchy-craving creatures, of course. He's made a doozy in #626 -- the blue critter unleashes bedlam and destruction on a galactic scale and is nigh invincible. Eventually, this angry little fuzzball will migrate to Earth and have his sharp edges softened out by a little girl, but first ... MAYHEM!   And off we go, out to cause some serious chaos. The point of the game isn't exactly to nuke all the baddies on the screen -- in fact, there really aren't that many enemies in the game (dunno what happened there, but you'll probably only spend about 15-20% of the game shooting bad guys). The real targets of Stitch's fervent energy are the random objects that have suffer the unfortunate fate of falling into Stitch's sights -- massive firepower is spent blowing up benches, boxes, growing crystals, computers, monitors, and anything else that would have been just fine left un-blown-up. Blasting inanimate objects probably isn't all that high on your Fun List -- especially since the design team didn't make any of the really big objects like sewage pipes and traffic cars destructible for real full-on carnage -- but there's still that vicarious thrill of running about in a game and lighting up everything in your path, and the game revels in that madness with everything exploding every second of play.    Just don't go into this game expecting a tight platformer outside of the shooting, because despite some great ideas, the camera sits and cuts one on this game's gameplay. It's the stupidest camera I've seen in a long, long while. The only time a Smart Cam cuts in is when it's got the absolutely stupidest choice possible for camera placement. If you're trying to hop on a Jump Pad to another ledge, it'll shift the camera to show you everywhere that your platform is not. Get in a tight corner and the cam will wig out and go batty trying to adjust. Stitch can grab onto most surfaces with his razor-sharp claws, but the camera spins so crazily out of control that you'll never know what way's up. Couple that with some clipping errors and a lot of problems with Stitch getting stuck in the game's haphazard geometry, and even the super-cool Grappling Hook gadget is a burden. Luckily, that kind of mad camera doesn't bug the sugar-fiending fanatics like Doug Perry -- it'll stop dead those who try to play through the platform sections carefully and with some semblance of logic or thinking, but those who pound down a box of Sugar Puffs with Mountain Dew for milk will always find some way to button-mash or wiggle the DualShock until they find some way through the puzzle-free game -- and if they ever get stuck or lost, they can just fall to their death and blast it all up again with infinite lives.   Graphics  For a game that's all about blowing stuff up (and only about blowing stuff up), it's kind of a shocker to see the game designers not get too giddy about making stuff blowing up look cool. For all the savage energy in the character and psychotic thinking in the game design, this game looks like it wants to be just a nice, quiet platformer. Here's the fastest way I have of explaining it: the game has no lighting effects. None. Any other game with this kind of rabid blasting would have every polygon blistering with lit intensity -- even on the PS one, games like One and Apocalypse pummeled your cathodes as every explosion, passing ship and even individual laser blast ignited the surroundings in a dazzling light show. Despite a competent developer, Stitch instead features flat, evenly-lit worlds that don't react in any way to the madness exploding all around -- the game should look like a fireworks display in a Battlebots arena, but instead seems more like a Nerf war at the local Target.    I'm guessing High Voltage is more keen on Xbox than PS2, because they have no tricks to pull out of their bag for this game. Aside from the non-existent lighting (I did notice some simple shading in a lava stage, but it was very subtle -- I shouldn't be using the word ~subtle~ to describe any part of this game!), the texture work is just sad. I usually slap down any whiner who says such-and-such looks like it's running on the PS one (go back and check out some original PlayStation games -- you might be shocked by what you used to be impressed by), but this game really is that simple. The plain, no-res textures look terrible except for when you're right near them (when they just look undetailed and fuzzy) make even wide-open spaces with lots of geometry (few and far between in this game) look awful because the lack of lighting and simple textures add up to nothing. Sure, the PS2 is a little bit hard to handle, but even first-gen games had liquid that wasn't just an animating texture and trees that wouldn't wilt next to foliage out of the last PSX Syphon Filter.   What they did get right, however, is the title character. Stitch is a compulsive destruction addict, a jittering glee-ball of insanity. He goes mad shooting with all four guns that he's armed with, cackling like a loony as he blows everything to smithereens in a rain of particles and shrapnel. If you yourself (of you have children who are) a compulsive destruction addict, you'll love it.   Sound  I'm wondering if the reason this game is so visually plain is just because it was rushed for the movie -- the sound sure seems like it didn't have much time invested in it. Explosion samples sound clipped and simple, and the audio is so cut-and-paste that the sound just drops out when another character chirps in to talk to you (they usually make no sense anyway -- either I'm crazy, or else there are instances in the game where Stitch calls himself up over the CB to cackle for no reason.) The story, however, is well told and makes for a good prequel to the film -- Disney actors were used in the production, so you'll hear the multi-purpose talent David Ogden Stiers as one of the main characters. Then there's Stitch himself, who's a riot of giggles and squeals.This game is a mess, plain and simple. Like, why the heck would you ever need strafing controls when you've got FOUR GUNS? I'm not sure why Sony bothers with these games instead of just letting Disney Interactive handle them -- they have so many different talents working on these projects (other Disney games have involved Argonaut, Blitz Games, Eurocom, Doki Denki, Bizarre Creations, and now High Voltage) that it just doesn't make sense why they don't spin off a Second Party developer to handle them (either that or nurture the different indie studios by sharing some First Party/R&D technology for all-around better future PS2 games). Instead, you tend to get what you've got here -- a rush-job by a busy dev filled with glitches and haphazard level design where the most clever challenges have you pulling off ludicrous feats and falling to your death before picking up the hidden item you've been searching for (which is placed nowhere near a ledge or grapple point) three seconds before you die.Still, some kids like a mess. Some adults too. The fun of Stitch: Experiment 626 is the mess. So long as you're the type of player to go willy-nilly into the void without once attempting to actually play the game, you could probably have a lot of fun playing the game. It's a lot of mayhem, a lot of chaos, and hardly a bit of reason for it. Sound like anybody you know?", "date": "Jun 21, 2002"}
