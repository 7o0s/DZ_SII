Titles such as Pac-Man and Space Invaders relied on basic, yet addictive concepts to keep drawing in the crowds. Joining their sides in popularity, Frogger was released that year in arcades (later on consoles such as Atari's wonder machine). It has gone on to become one of the most memorable videogames ever created thanks to one idea: how did the frog cross the road? Once Konami's masterpiece hit arcades, people couldn't resist hopping down to the nearest cabinet to steer the green critter on his dangerous path to fly eating enlightenment. Due to a lock-up over the rights, there have only been sequels recently. For this current generation, Konami has created Frogger Beyond, a title that simply offers up more of the same Frogger gameplay in a larger 3D environment. Granted, he's got more moves and has to conquer more varied, challenging levels than ever before, but without major advancements to gameplay, Frogger Beyond can't help but stand out more as a faithful tribute than a thrilling next-generation title, especially when Swampy's Revenge is still taking up shelf space. But maybe that's just the way it should be.   The latest update to this arcade classic takes an otherwise raw and unsophisticated concept, and tries to expand on it. However, at its core, the Frogger series has always amounted to nothing more than the simple avoidance of moving obstacles in demanding, twitch-based environments. This general mantra has not changed for Frogger Beyond. In fact, even with previous development efforts including, there was no major advancement -- just more variation. It seems that this is the path that everyone's favorite amphibian is destined to hop. As far as we're concerned, adhering to the former style of gameplay is the best idea. Like Sega's Super Monkey Ball, it serves itself well as a level-by-level puzzle/platformer.   In Frogger Beyond, players control the likes of a young frog who is passing into manhood -- or ~froghood~ if you will. On this, his landmark birthday, Frogger must face new trials that will change him forever. These just happen to be the eight levels, broken up into numerous sub-sections. They range in theme from lush tropical rainforests to high-tech dreamscapes. With each subsection you'll find a fantastic amount of level designs and even basic puzzle elements. These include hitting magic switches to reveal hidden pathways to hopping onto moving platforms, or sliding down a slope. There are often multiple pathways, as well, which must be explored if you hope to find the level key and progress forward.   Konami has included new items such as the speed, invincibility, and sticky tongue power-up to diversify gameplay, but it's something that you mostly use at your own discretion. Additionally, the Hawaii based development team has included forward-scrolling sequences such as surfing tree trunks, steering mine carts, and snowboarding down mountains. The events are far and few in-between, but they are there and help break the monotony. Overall, however, most of the gameplay relies heavily on the tried and true Frogger hop and dodge which is executed via a very similar control scheme. Arrow keys that you have to constantly tap to move one ~square~ in the desired direction are here. Meanwhile, you can use a jump button (C, by default) to leap two ~squares~ at a time, and other keys to rotate Frogger. It feels awkward at first, but once you adjust to it you shouldn't have any major problems.   The biggest issue we had with the gameplay is probably the camera. It is static and moves on its own, remaining mostly intuitive, but there are times when it can cost you a life. If you've played Frogger before you'll know how frustrating restarting a level can be. Thankfully there are checkpoints and even save points (at the start of each level), but even then you will find it's very easy to burn through five or more lives if you lack patience. If you're easily turned off by a high number of discouraging deaths, Frogger Beyond is likely not for you, for in addition to a wonky camera, some of the 3D elements make it hard to judge what can and can't be jumped and when you should and should not jump. It requires a great deal of patience and persistence. To make up for this demanding gameplay formula, every level features a great amount of diversity in design. This much is appreciated.   In truth, Frogger Beyond is still very much like its predecessors, only this time it has the added spice of fancier visuals, more creatures, some power-ups, and more variation. Seemingly, that's the correct formula, but after having our go with it yet again, we can't help but wonder if Frogger's life has run short. The gameplay has been nearly fully explored and, unlike something akin to the aforementioned Super Monkey Ball -- a title chock full of addictive multiplayer features -- it lacks that kind of robustness.   What did you think of Frogger Beyond?  Using RenderWare, Frogger Beyond manages to be suitable enough in the graphics department. It's by no means a feat of any kind, but it runs mostly smoothly with decent texture work and mediocre animation. You will find it lacks any sort of interesting lighting or fancy particle effects, but given its leap over original arcade version and the recent PSX titles, it's nothing to get your panties in a bunch about -- even if it could have been much more beautiful. Insanely, it seems to only want to run at 640x480. Why, I have no idea.  Given all from the above, as you would expect, the soundtrack for Konami's latest Frogger features beats geared for every level theme. You'll hear drums and tribal sounds in the jungle, for example. There are also creature effects to catch your ear, and every so often Frogger will actually say something when he spots something in the environment. Overall, it suffices, but then he sounds like one of the bastard children from a Pokemon knockoff.  Frogger Beyond is true to its roots, but not exactly a long-lasting game. The thrill runs short after you experience a fair amount of deaths, and this frustration is cause to consider Konami's latest addition to the series a try-only title. Only the most diehard Frogger fanatic will find their money well spent, and even then just playing Swampy's first is probably a good idea.We're Frogger addicts from our youths, but what made that game great doesn't translate to the next-gen era too well. 3D, in this case (more so than Swampy's, it seems), actually hampers the fun of the game, for design is often the sole reason for death. Classic Frogger? Yes. Still worth the money and the time? Likely not.", "date": "Apr 23, 2003"}
