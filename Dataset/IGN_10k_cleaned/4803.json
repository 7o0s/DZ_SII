Almost as an apology for that game, the company has released the second DBZ fighter for the handheld: Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warrior, an infinitely more competent and faithful design that really wows in the presentation department. The fighting mechanics aren't quite as ironed out as expected and don't quite match up with the energetic front end, but overall Atari has brought out a decent game that better captures the Dragon Ball Z flavor than previous titles in the series have on the GBA handheld. Features Fifteen unlockable, playable characters Story, tag team, and survival modes Cartridge save to record unlocked characters Link cable support for two players  At the very least, the developers poured a whole lot of effort into Supersonic Warrior's graphic engine. Using a combination of traditional sprite scaling and Mode 7 effects, Banpresto's fighter features a fantastic dynamic camera that zooms in, out and around the action as the two Dragon Ball Z characters duke it out in the air. This type of engine isn't exactly a new thing to the fighting genre, but it's rare that a GBA game gets this sort of treatment...even though the portable hardware was obviously made with these types of games in mind.  The game mechanics don't quite keep to the traditional one-on-one fighting design, but that's the nature of Dragon Ball Z; in the cartoon, these guys fly and zoom and careen off one another in each 22 minute episode, and to accurately portray this over the top action you have to take liberties in realism. In the awful Dragon Ball Z: Taiketsu, the designers kept almost all of the action on the ground, with only a tiny focus on airborne fights. It's completely the other direction in Supersonic Warriors, and it makes much more sense this way, especially if you've seen only a single show.  It would have been better had the designers limit the airborne battles somewhat instead of focusing entirely on them, but overall it's a better choice to have the fights in the stratosphere than on terrafirma.  So, because the fights can have a lot of distance between the two characters thanks to the dynamic camera, the designers put a lot of emphasis on ~double-tapping~ control mechanics to have the characters boost quickly towards each other. Double-tapping in a direction will zip the player in the direction that's tapped, whether that's for an offensive or defensive evasion. Attacks can come from above, below, or directly in front of the characters, and as the action moves on-screen the characters remain face-to-face nearly the whole time. In some modes, tag-team characters allow for players to swap out fighters mid-fight for a quick escape or a more violent set of attacks.    Though the game features a ton of characters from the Dragon Ball Z series, the balance between them is simply speed and power; characters don't have much in the way of attacks in Supersonic Warriors. Players can either weak or strong attack with the B or A buttons respectively, or they can use their special attacks with a combination of the R trigger and the two attack buttons together. Blocking is oddly mapped on the strong attack button; it's a little odd to have the block control share its function with an attack button, but it does work to a relative degree in action since players can easily counter a blocked attack with an immediate strong kick or punch.  But as much control as the game may seem to have, the battles seem to end up being the ~button mashing~ kind since that's really the best way to string together the combos. Oh, sure, there's a lot more technique involved for the more skilled individual, including special attacks that come from nailing a downed opponent at just the right time, but overall success with the computer opponents, at least on the default difficulty setting, does boil down to a good amount of blind, repetitive mashing on the control pad and buttons. No promises that this will work against a human opponent via the link cable, though, since fights seem to get a little less predictable in multiplayer. And it's really this button-mashing element that brings down Supersonic Warriors's fun, because the rest of the package is a really rock-solid development. The game really does feel like a part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise, fitting in extremely well with an energetic, peppy presentation. Though newbies won't really get the whole story between all of the characters in the game, the fact that the tale of Dragon Ball Z is abridged for each of the fighters in Story Mode will definitely please the true diehards of the franchise.", "date": "Jun 23, 2004"}
