Often times, they fight lawless gangs in burned out shells of cities.  They continually try to take down criminal organizations and they are constantly fighting corruption from inside their own ranks.  Many of these officers also have to contend with an elite upper class that flouts the law constantly, only to walk away with a slap on the wrist.  It sounds like something cribbed from Minority Report or Robocop, but many gamers also know scenarios like this quite well, from titles like Blade Runner or even Deus Ex.  Strategy First and Mist Land offers up a new bleak future to explore with their latest turn-based title, Cops 2170: The Power of Law.   Cops 2170 is the story of Katy, a recent graduate of the police academy eagerly looking forward to her first day of service.  Unfortunately, Katy's inexperience with her job and the harsh reality of the streets are on a direct collision course.  There's a massive amount of street crime in what's known as the Lower City, where mutants and a criminal organization known as the Syndicate seem to be fighting over every bit of land they can get their hands on.  While there doesn't appear to be crime in the Upper City, thanks to the strict requirements to live there, rules are sometimes broken in those areas.  Even newer, and perhaps more shocking to her, is the fact that Katy's beloved police department also has a number of corrupt officers on the payroll, who seem to hide behind the badge to further their own interests, criminal or otherwise.  There also seems to be a number of shady corporations running things in town and even terrorist plots hatched by an evil genius that she'll have to contend with during the course of her career.   Fortunately, the game provides a number of branching plotlines for players to explore, each of which have their own consequences on other story decisions.  For instance, Katy can choose to help the continually exiled Mutants remove the Syndicate from their territory, only to gain a powerful enemy and potentially have to fend off attacks from their thugs continually.  She can also choose to back the crooked cops, although finding out who's actually dirty is a tricky process.  The concept allows for mild replayability, since you can pick another path for Katy to explore, and it gives a different spin on the world in 2170.   However, this is perhaps the lone saving grace of Cops 2170, as the game radically throws away just about every advance or standard of the turn-based strategy genre.  First of all, the game starts off with an extremely brief intro sequence which doesn't fully describe the background or environment of the game itself.  From there, the game starts immediately without any tutorial or instruction as to how to maneuver around the world or interact with characters.  In fact, the game essentially leaves this up to the manual, which doesn't explain how to play the game very well at all, nor does it give you an idea of how certain sections written in the instruction booklet figure into the game.  This results in plenty of stumbling around until you get a mild sense of how to navigate around.     It doesn't help that you can't do standard moves such as moving all of your units at the same time, or even that you have the option to select multiple characters when you're not in combat.  This means that the game slows down to a lethargic crawl as you move one character from point A to point B as you attempt to follow the plot, which quickly becomes so jumbled and almost impossible to follow that you may accidentally stumble upon a branching moment instead of purposefully choosing it.  For instance, after a gunfight, I was so completely confused as to how to actually advance the story that I wound up inadvertently shooting an NPC out of frustration.  Luckily for me, that was how I managed to ~accept~ a mission, but a player shouldn't have to stumble upon solutions to move the plot along.    Combat is just as flawed as the standard gameplay.  First of all, just about any weapon can kill a character, no matter how much body armor they wear or how small it may be.  While that makes sense in real life, it's not particularly practical in this futuristic setting.  The second issue with combat is that the game places a large number of ~neutral~ units on the map itself, many of which wind up killing most of the enemies on each map.  This doesn't make combat engaging; in fact, it reduces it to a tedious afterthought.  Why am I engaging in battle if most of my work is going to be done for me?  Even worse, the game spends so much time on making these characters operate in ~hidden movement~ loading screens that you'll hate the idea of going into a gun battle.   You're also forced to constantly track down every single enemy and make sure they're dead before you can move on with the game.  Unfortunately, since every single map is huge, it can take a long time to search out every single corner to find that last hiding character.  I spent 45 minutes on one map looking for one single guy that was literally moving in a circle, which is simply infuriating.  That actually points out another flaw in the combat, which is that the AI for the game is consistently idiotic.  I've seen many of them either not move when they've been targeted by one character, run up to an attacking character (effectively closing the distance and increasing the accuracy for the other fighter), or perform some other strange action.  Finally, you may find that your character's pathfinding ability completely sucks, meaning that you'll wind up wasting more of your action points trying to correct what they've done instead of getting them to do what you want them to.   The visuals don't help to back up the flawed gameplay either.  While they're not horrible, they're not extremely well done, either.  In fact, these seem like recycled backgrounds from older titles that have been dusted off and placed in a new title.  Many of these textures are muddy or generic, and it's hard to actually get excited about many of the areas that you'll wander through because they're so non-descript.  You'll also find that there's really no reason for the inclusion of a first person viewpoint in the game, because it doesn't add to the game in any way.  Sound isn't much better, with plenty of generic sound effects and decent, but not outstanding techno scattered through the game.  Unfortunately, you'll be hard pressed to hear the techno because the continual drivel and idiotic chatter that characters spout over the radio drowns out other sounds, especially when the game repeats the same comments on a loop.  I don't need to hear about some woman Maxim hooked up with 5 or six times in a fight, nor do I need to hear other police comments all the time unless it's important.  Especially cringe worthy is the voice acting which is simply horrible across the board, from Katy on down to the most basic thug.    Cops 2170 is one of those titles that seems stuck in a time warp:  it has graphics that seem to be a few years old, gameplay thats antiquated by a decade or more, and a setting whose popularity in the gaming industry has essentially come and gone.  There isnt a multiplayer component, training feature or difficulty level to tweak, leaving only branches in the flawed plot device to provide replayability.  This is one of those game that can only really be truly recommended for the serious hardcore gamers who are interested in playing a title that really shouldve been released years ago instead of right now.  Unfortunately, I cant imagine that many of them would booting this up over a session of X-Com.", "date": "Jan 31, 2005"}
