{"name": "Army Men: World War", "name_review": "Army Men: World War", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/08/army-men-world-war-2", "text": "Thank God for the Army Men franchise. Thirty friggin' games a year, and each one successfully maintains that high bar of mediocrity on PlayStation. But you know what keeps me up at night? No, it's not nightmares of IGNDC's Anoop dancing around in one of those schoolgirl uniforms he so loves to see the ladies all dressed in. No, it's the fact that despite the fact that almost nobody I know actually played with army men when they were little, 3DO's marketing and PR teams have managed to convince a large part of the populace that they did, and that they should by these games. Perhaps they were toys of the generation before me, but still...  Well, it looks like I can keep having those nightmares, because 3DO has unleashed Army Men World War upon an unprepared and unexpecting world, and only a few months after Army Men: Sarge's Heroes. And my nightmares will be that much worse because, amazingly, the game actually could have been good. Not great, mind you, but somewhat good.  Gameplay According to World War's packaging, Army Men 3D actually won an award. I don't buy it, but I'm pretty sure there are laws against direct lies on packaging, so someone, somewhere, bestowed some honor on AM3D. ~So what's the damn point, Sam,~ I hear you ask. ~You've spend a good quarter of this review bashing the hell out the Army Men franchise, and now you're making references to older crappy games!~ Patience, my son. World War uses the same formula as AM3D (and presumably Sarge's Heroes, but I wasn't ~gifted~ with that review, and since I avoid these games like a vampire fears sunlight, I wouldn't know), thus the comparison.   Anywho, enough ranting. World War places you in the shoes of SURPRISE, a soldier in the green army, out for tan plastic blood. Apparently peace talks between the green and tan armies have broken off and now it's war (again). Of course if they DID reach peace, there would be an end to the series and the world would sleep a little easier, much like what happens in Gotham when Batman locks away the Joker, but that's not going to happen. Thanks to the encroaching tan threats (looks like all those butt whuppins you gave the tans in the 50 other Army Men games did jack smack), every green man has been enlisted, and you're one of 'em. You'll guide your soldier through various missions, blasting everything in sight. Look, there's nothing new here -- story or gameplay-wise -- save for a few choice moments with a twin .50 machine gun, but more on that later.   The big problem with this game isn't -- in a first for a 3DO game -- the graphics. Nope, it's the control. While your little green man runs along at a pretty nice pace, the rate with which he turns is slow. As slow as that old lady who always ends up in front of you whenever you need to get somewhere quickly, and when you're getting popped by the enemy a mere 90 away, and you DIE because you couldn't turn. There's more I could say, but for the purposes of civility, the control is not good.   There are a few nicely selected weapons on hand that pump a little fun into the game. They range from a trusty bayonet to the AK-47 look- and sound-alike, to the simple grenades to mortar and rocket launchers, to a flame thrower to machine gun, to, well, you get the idea. If you're lucky, you'll also be able to take a queue from Medal of Honor and commandeer a twin .50 cal machine gun turret or Howitzer. I have to say that gunning down 10 or so men is a blast, especially with the DualShock feedback.   Also, the game is unbearably hard, even on easy. At first I thought it was just my overwhelming gag reflex that I got from even subjecting my PlayStation to one of these games. But the more I looked at the way my character took damage, and especially how he turned to face said damage, I just realized that it's needlessly tough. On average, I'd say I spent three or four tries for each level, but many required as many as 10. Now I'm not the world's greatest gamer, but I'm definitely good, and when I'm kicking the bucket this often on the easy setting, there's something seriously wrong here.   Graphics Amazingly, it looks like 3DO has learned a few more graphics tricks. Likewise, the texture work, while not great, is markedly improved over its last efforts. Gone are the horribly overused translucency light beams for every explosion (in fact, the only time you'll see them is where they should be used: as muzzle flashes). Now, we get full-booming explosions and multi-colored smoke trails on smoldering debris. As I said before, the texture work now looks much better than almost any other 3DO game. No longer is there a feel ~shared textures~ among all the company's games, and the stuff you see here is actually rather varied, ranging from boulders sparsely littering a beach, to dense jungle foliage.   The framerate is also smooth as butter, and shows no real instances of slowdown. Granted, there's not usually a ton on the screen at once, but I'd rather have a consistent framerate with minor detail then tons of crap on screen and end up watching a slideshow, or worse yet, a rubber band effect (i.e. 20fps-10fps-30-20-15-20-10 etc.).   The interface, however, is just like any other game coming out of that three-letter publisher (I'm really tired of writing their name every six seconds, I think the PR clipping service will have picked up on their name by now). It literally feels, like so many other games from them, that as soon as the code was finished, they slapped a static screen behind some text for menus, and then maybe decided to toss in some music. It shows no imagination or effort, and it's just weak.   Sound World War's music is, if anything, decent. There was never an instance where I want ~wow, that's really good,~ but at the same time, I wasn't scrambling for the mute button on my remote as my ears began to bleed, either. Music punctuates parts of the action, where applicable, but nothing more. It fades in and out, usually without making much fuss, and I'm happy with that.   The effects are well done, too, but again, they won't win any awards. There's a nice chuga-chuga on the big guns, and the machine guns are crisp and clean. There's no speech, however, and the overall aural presentation is just lacking a bit.While the latest Army Men game to come along still feels like it was kicked out the door without any real feet, major strides have been made the way of graphics. These games still need a LOT of work to really even be fun, but at least I know that 3DO's making some headway. At best, this game is a rental, but you may end up chucking it even faster than I did.", "date": "Apr 8, 2000"}
