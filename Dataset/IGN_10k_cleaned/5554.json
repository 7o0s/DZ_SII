Strap your hands around a PlayStation controller and play NBA Live 99 instead.  This year's version is a major step forward, seeing many new enhancements to the popular basketball series.  The obvious change is in the game's redesigned 3D engine. Characters have a very solid and realistic look thanks to advanced light sourcing and shading. And the crowds  at least in the first few rows  are now 3D objects as well. Most notably, though are the new animations of the athletes. Players are given a breath of life thanks to EA's new facial expression engine  they'll smile, frown, yell, squint throughout the game. This feature eliminates the eerie blank stares that have been in sports games of late.  EA Sports has also tweaked the artificial intelligence to get the game playing as realistically as possible  players will react to double-teams a lot more effectively in NBA Live 99. There's also a detailed season tracking mode where you can keep tabs on each player, not only in a season but also throughout his entire NBA career. And if you want to put yourself in the game, there's an elaborate character-creation mode where you can select attributes from body build and skin color, all the way to his attitude on the court.   NBA Live 99 features a few modes of play that will both appease fans of arcade-action as well as those more interested in simulating the sport. An outdoor court is also be available if you need to get in a little practice. And if you just want to jump in and play a game, the Quick Start Mode is definitely for you.   Like last year, NBA Live 99 also mimics coverage that's seen on NBA on TNT. Which means graphic overlays, camera angles, and instant replays to give a more TV-like presentation. All the expected details, like accurate player uniforms, 1997-1998 statistics, and ambient arena sound effects are here as well. Even though basketball isn't my sport (we all know that hockey is the real game to play), I'm having an absolute blast with NBA Live 99. And since I could care less about simulating the sport, I really enjoy what EA Sports has done to the arcade-style option. Turn off all the fouls and out-of-bounds, and the game plays like a five-on-five NBA Jam. Even the slam dunks are exaggerated a bit  which is fine by me.The 3D engine is the best yet  the lighting on each of the players really give them a solid look, and the facial expressions, while certainly just fluff, adds life to the players. I think we'll see this feature in more EA Sports titles, as well as competitors' products from here on in.My biggest complaint is the fact that you can't rely on just hitting a button to change the character you're controlling. You have to push in the direction of that player, and then hit the button. This is an extra step I could do without, since I'm used to cycling the cursor underneath the closest player to the ball.Other than that, this game is energetic, gorgeous, and fun to watch. Yet another quality sports title from EA Sports.", "date": "Nov 7, 1998"}
