While those other systems have been seeing a steady stream of monster-killing creepiness over the last few years, only a handful of horror titles have made their way to the 'box. To make matters worse, none of these games, with the exception of the excellent Silent Hill 2, have been particularly worthwhile.   With this in mind, it's easy to see why some people might get excited about Run Like Hell.  After all, Interplay's space-based survive-a-thon sounds pretty decent on paper.  Take aliens run amok on a space station, throw in a handful of survivors voiced by relatively big-name talent, and add some weapons and puzzles.  Doesn't sound half bad, right?  Right?   Wrong.   When Run Like Hell was first released for the PS2 last October, it was a lousy game.  Despite a handful of tweaks, including a new area and downloadable content, the Xbox version of the game is still as bad as it ever was.   Gameplay   If you've ever played a survival horror game, you're already familiar with the basic template Run Like Hell is working with.  Trapped in an alien infested space-station, you've got to wander around, collect items, solve puzzles, shoot stuff and so on.  It's all so very Resident Evil.   To the game's credit, it does stray in a few ways from the Resident Evil formula.  What you'll notice first is that you're not saddled with that game's antiquated ~turn, then walk~ control scheme.  If you want your disgruntled space miner to go right, you simply press right on the left analog stick.  You'd be surprised how many of these types of games haven't gotten the memo about how much better this control scheme is yet.   The other big change of pace is the use of fully 3d environments, instead of pre-rendered screens.  This allows you to move the camera around with the right stick, theoretically eliminating those always frustrating ~There's somebody attacking me right off camera that I can't see~ moments.   Of course, the fact that the game likes to drop enemies directly behind you kind of nullifies some of the moveable camera's benefits.   Despite these improvements on the formula, Run Like Hell fails miserably as a survival horror experience.  The survival is there, I suppose, since there are bad guys who want to kill you, but where's the horror?   While there's plenty of gore, there's nothing in this game that can be even remotely described as frightening.       In the few cutscenes where the game tries to scare, it just doesn't work.  ~Oh no, alien slime is flooding the elevator.  Wait, my guy is climbing out of the elevator all on his own.~  Yawn.   Run Like Hell's attempts to frighten during gameplay are even more pathetic.  It's like somebody at Interplay said ~Gee, in Resident Evil, when bad guys sometimes pop up all of a sudden it sure is scary.  What if every monster in our game pops up out of nowhere?  Then we'd be that many times more scary than Resident Evil!~   Scary?  No.  Irritating as all Hell (pun very much intended)? Oh yes.   In virtually every room in the game, you'll find yourself attacked by a handful of boring, uninspired aliens.  Most of the time they simply drop from the ceiling, but they've been known to walk through walls as well.  Since you're usually surrounded and unable to run away, whatever you're doing grinds to a halt as you're forced to gun down the baddies.      This wouldn't be so bad if Run Like Hell's combat wasn't excruciatingly boring. Here's how it works:  If the alien is far away, lock on, walk backwards, and shoot.  If it's close, use the Y button to knock it down with the butt of your weapon, then shoot it.  Repeat process thousands of times.  Later in the game, some of the aliens remember that they can shoot balls of yellow gloop at you, forcing you to dodge with the L button, but the combat remains dull throughout the game.   The game's weapons do little to improve the experience.  While you do get a decent amount of weapons, including pulse rifles, sonic guns and the obligatory shotgun, you'll almost never use anything but the default assault rifle. The ability to upgrade the weapon strength with computer chips found throughout the game combined with the rifle's unlimited ammunition, make it the gun of choice throughout the game.     Run Like Hell's puzzles are almost as bad as its combat.  Most of them fall into the ~Wander around the level until you find the water pump mysteriously hidden in a science station, then use it to water a plant, opening the door to the next room.~ category.  Ugh.     Another common puzzle is the tried-and-true ~You need a password to open the door, and a bunch of corpses each have notes on them giving one part of if.~  However, the codes are only four or five letters long, and each letter is either A,X,Y, or B, corresponding to a button on the controller face.  The cleverer amongst you are already way ahead of me on this: Once you've found the first two or three letters, it's far easier to simply run through the 16 possible combinations of the last two letters than it is to actually bother hunting for them.  Of course, anything that makes this game shorter is certainly a good thing.   As bad as this game is, at least Interplay included a smattering of online functionality.  Players will be able to download a handful of skins for the main character, including Conner's girlfriend, who's clad in nothing but a bra and panties.  That's always a plus.  There are also a couple of minigames, but both were so boring that I turned them off well before I died.     Interplay has told us that these downloads will be available to the public at game launch, but since we use a separate developers network to test out pre-release copies of online games, I can't personally vouch for that.   Graphics   While the Xbox version of Run Like Hell does look a little bit better than its PS2 counterpart, it's still an ugly, ugly game.     The only thing that I can think of that deserves the slightest bit of praise is our hero Nick Connor's character model.  He's not particularly exciting-looking (unless you have a fetish for crew cut sporting guys in gray jumpsuits), but his face is impressively detailed, and looks fairly realistic even when the camera zooms way in.   While the bad guys are also tolerably well put together, the rest of the supporting cast could have used some serious tweaking.  Polygon counts are on the low side, and character designs, especially for the ~nice~ aliens, are, at least to my taste, kind of dull.       The game's environments, on the other hand, are just plain craptacular, and among the worst in the genre.  Textures are laughably bland, and the level design is atrocious.  I understand that the game is supposed to take place on a space station and all, but that doesn't mean I want to walk through endless gray corridors for hours on end.  Sure there are occasional breaks from the tedium of steel-plated halls, like the Xbox-exclusive -and very short- hydroponics level, but these are few and far between.  I'm reminded of the old Saturn game Robotica, and trust me, that's not a good thing.   What really pushes the needle of my ~awful graphics detector~ into the red is a number of embarrassing graphical glitches.   In the most obvious ~You've got to be kidding me~ moment, a cutscene shows Nick and an extraterrestrial friend toasting something or other.  I guess in the future bottles of beer are invisible, because you don't see them here.  That's right, you see their hands, close up, open like they should be holding a drink, but when they clink bottles and chug their beverages, there's simply nothing there.  This is the sort of thing we here at IGN are used to seeing in early builds of games, but in a finished product?  Come on.      Sound   The voice acting in Run Like Hell is probably its least bad aspect.  Conner is voiced by the gravel-throated Lance Henriksen of Aliens (which this game's monsters blatantly rip off) fame, and fits the role perfectly.  Everybody's least favorite  Star Trek captain, Kate Mulgrew, also makes an appearance as a huge, insect-like alien doctor.  While her performance is fine, the decision to use her unaltered voice for the game's least-humanoid character is a strange one indeed.   The game's music, on the other hand, is enough to make you want to cut off your ears, if it wasn't for the excruciating pain and the difficulty in reattaching them.   Most of time, there's simply no music at all.  This is when Run Like Hell sounds its best.  Occasionally, the game will decide to play a few strains of generic survival-horror ~something bad is about to happen~ music.  Does this mean that something particularly bad is about to happen?  Not usually.  It just sort of happens at random in certain rooms, whether or not you're about to be attacked.  If you are attacked, and clear the room of enemies, the  ~danger~ music continues to play regardless.   That's not the worst thing about the music, though.  During boss fights and in the downloadable minigames, players are treated to some of the worst butt-rock this side of a Creed concert.  The first time the lead singer of whatever band this is scream ~There's no place like hooooome!~ while I was gunning down alien invaders, I literally fell off my couch laughing.  Then I turned the game off.  The last time I checked, survival horror games were supposed to be scary.  The only thing frightening about Run Like Hell is the prospect of having to play through it more than once.  The incessant combat feels like filler designed to make the game longer.  So do the plentiful and unoriginal puzzles.  What's left?  Not much. While Run Like Hell isn't quite ~Throw your controller at the screen~ awful, it's bad enough that there's really no reason anybody should even think about buying it.  Until another worthwhile survival horror game makes its way to the Xbox, you'd be better off just playing Silent Hill again.This one should have stayed on the PS2.", "date": "Apr 4, 2003"}
