It blended a  top-down perspective for interacting with the environment, and then launched into a full 3D view for the turn-based battles. Graphically, it wasn't amazing, but it was rather good for the time, and offered some amazingly good music and a solid story.   Fast-forward about 5 years. Today, we have Wild Arms: 2nd Ignition. It offers the same mix of top-down exploration and full 3D combat, but almost nothing more. The battle system is still intact, offering a slower-paced turn-based scheme, but it's amazingly similar to the first game. So much so, that graphics are rather shoddy by today's standards. The battle system's graphics are EXACTLY as they were with the first game, and with the PlayStation being pushed to its limits by titles in every conceivable genre, especially RPG's, WA2's graphics are simply disappointing. But in role-playing games, the story can help lift a crappy looking game into the annals of RPGdom. (Just look at Lunar. Sure, it's dated now, and technically still was even after Working Designs updated it, but the story and characters make it one of the best RPG's -- if not games -- of all time.)   Gameplay The sequel, brings back many of the rather innovative features from the first game, including the ability to use each party member's items to interact with the environment (i.e. throw a knife to flick a switch far away, a fireball for... burning things, etc.), a simple dash move, the ability to switch the party's lead character (usually in order to use his/her items), the 8-way directional control, and even the original's menu system and fonts. 5 years down the road, though, the fonts are still hard to read, and the icons can be a little confusing at times.   Also preserved was the simple and easy to use battle interface. Icons represent the different battle options. Whether it's to fight, run, enable the auto-battle option (where the computer handles the fighting for you), switch equipment, move your party around, use the original powers (more on those later), use an item, defend, or use a custom command (more on those later too). To pick an item, simply hold a direction on the d-pad (there's no analog support here, kids) and hit X, simple as that.   There have been a few notable improvements since the last game, but they're restricted to the battle system. The biggest and probably most welcome of them is the ability to avoid most battles while you're walking around the overworld and anywhere else a battle could occur. On most occasions, a small white caption box with an exclamation point will appear over your leaders head. Simply tapping O will avoid the battle. There are, of course, unavoidable non-boss fights, designated by a red caption box. Also added was the ability to attack different body parts on bosses, netting you more experience if you take out limbs or other parts than just killing the boss off by hitting his main body. While the option to avoid some battles is an extremely welcome feature, the ability to attack different body parts has been in use by other RPG's for years, and really should have been in the first game.   The ARMS from WA2 has a different meaning than the first game. Wild Arms' original definition (and source for the title) of ARMS, were ancient relics that basically imbued their user with powers that were not normally available, whether it was enhancing a magic attack or allowing a character to just take a shot at an enemy with a gun. The word ARMS in the sequel references a group of mercenaries that have banded together to form a protective group, so it's technically an acronym, not an object as in the first. Now, throughout the story, the role of ARMS changes, (hence the ~wild~ aspect of it), and provides a focal point for the story's man brunt of narration.   Without giving away too much, let's just say that WA2 is another tired rehash of a self-deprecating hero who's thrust into leadership and charged with saving the world simply because he's been chosen to do so by fate. Don't get me wrong, Ashley is surer of himself in most situations than the recent Final Fantasy leading men, but there are still too many introverted moments of ~Did I do the right thing? Why was I chosen? Blah blah blah.~ It's not a horrible plot and there are a few nice twists and thickeners, but as you'll see if you actually end up playing the game, it's better suited for an adventure game then an RPG.   I don't often reference Nintendo characters in PlayStation reviews, but throughout all of his quests, you never saw Link bitch about his role in things or doubt his every thought. No, he sucked it up, kicked some @$$ and took names. We need to go back to a time when lead characters will like that in an RPG or adventure game. Okay, enough ranting, I'm done.   Graphics The first Wild Arms was an interesting mix of 2D and 3D. The normal overworld operations were carried out in 2D, with some nicely done sprites for the characters layered on top of simplistic  view environments. When an enemy attacked, the screen launched into a full 3D battle system and your characters got their brawl on. No, this isn't new, but it was still a rather fledgling idea in PlayStation RPG's.   Amazingly, 5 years later, this hasn't changed much. Yes, the  view is still around, but now it's done with full 3D backgrounds, and the same well-animated sprites (in fact the animation this time around is much better). The problem lies in the battle engine. It's crap. Utter crap. In a time when Final Fantasy continues to redefine what a game can look like on the PSX, a game from a 2nd party developer should at least look better than the previous game. Sadly, this just isn't the case.   The combat engine is quite literally the same as the first game, both looks and play wise. Graphically, this is a step back in the evolution of games. The textures are grainy, blocky and uninspired, and reek of first-generation work. The character models during the battle sequences are animated extremely well, but they're rather lame and for the most part lack any sort of details that give them personality. I noticed multiple instances of pop-through on the enemies and main characters as well. Another odd point is that the characters seem to have been painted with textures that make them look almost cartoony. Whether this is because they're so plain and simple or whether it was done deliberately is really anybody's guess, but the end effect is still the same: it looks bad.   Developers Contrail are in love with translucency effects, throwing in multiple shafts of light whenever they can (when you hit an enemy, when the enemy hits you, when a boss dies, etc.). This was cute back at the dawn of PlayStation gaming, and when used subtly it's still effective, but this is the most blatant use of it I've seen in a long time. All of the effects, while done well, are taken to the nth degree and just stick out far too much, ruining any slick effect they would have had.   The really funny thing is, the work that was done on the exterior, exploratory engine is actually quite good. Colored lighting splashed The textures are handled nicely, with a good variety, and while they're not amazing, they're not really an eyesore either. This may be because of the distance of the camera, as it's positioned much farther away than the battle camera (for obvious reasons with the character sprites becoming horribly pixilated at too close up). The characters themselves are animated very well, especially for sprites, and actually do things like hand objects to each other, something that uses costly one-time animations and is almost never used with sprites anymore. good job, Contrail.   Sound WA2's sound effects are an odd mix of good and bad. The various menu swoops and swishes are good, and done well, but the overall effects are rather lame. Most of the time, it's just low bitrate rumbles and growls, but every once in a while, you'll hear a REALLY bad muffled yell or cheer. To make things worse, the battle effects are nearly as muffled, and really don't offer anything special or new. You'll get the familiar magic chimes and whistles, and the weapon blows often connect with a weak thud. Effects wise, this game's a dud.   The music on the other hand, is great. In fact, it's fantastic. The first game's music was rather simple, and followed, for the most part, tweaks on the main theme. WA2, on the other hand, while keeping with the light, upbeat themes, is much more diverse, and can range from moving to inspiring. One of the main things that permeated all of the songs in the first game was a sharp, melodic harmonica that would break in a just the right time. While the sequel's music doesn't really boast any identifiable instruments throughout the score, it does manage to pay homage to the first game with a rare pinch of 4 notes that you'll instantly recognize if you're paying attention.   I had high hopes for the sequel to Wild Arms. In many ways, the first game got me hooked on the PlayStation RPG library, and while it wasn't a stellar title, it could hold it's own. Of course, when put up against the other role playing games at its initial release, (like Beyond the Beyond) it was the clear winner.  The sequel, while delivering nostalgia by the fistfuls, never really offers anything especially new. If you liked the first game, head down to your local video store and snag a rental. It's good for a few trips down memory lane, but it's sadly not a keeper.", "date": "May 6, 2000"}
