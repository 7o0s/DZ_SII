{"name": "Bookworm", "name_review": "Bookworm", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/06/16/bookworm", "text": "Popcap Games' Bookworm is an incredibly popular web game that's freely available as a browser download for quick shots of mind-bending fun. It's a great game design for wordsmiths or for anyone looking for a fun way to improve on their mental vocabulary. Majesco's worked with the game's creator to port the PC game over to the Game Boy Advance, giving players the opportunity to play a few rounds of the challenging word game without the need to be around a PC. And it still is a fun game on the go, just don't expect a hugely elaborate production beyond what can already be played on the same system you're using to read this review. Bookworm is what you'd get if you mixed Scrabble tiles into a Tetris-style gameplay mechanic. The premise is simple: from a constant grid of off-set letters, form words to make them disappear. The longer and more complex the word is, of course, the more points are rewarded. The deeper players go, the more frequent the ~burning~ tiles show up; these are what dictate the game's end. If a ~burning~ tile works its way down the playfield and lands at the bottom of the pit, it's all over for the player. So, it's obviously important to remove these harmful tiles from play as quickly as possible. On the flipside, some tiles will reward players with additional points if they work those letters into words for the most points possible. During the action, players will also be faced with an additional task: to form a specific word for bonus points. This quota, while not necessary to succeed in the game, does keep players' minds sharp as they try to move the tiles in the bin to shift them in order to form that extra word.  Now, Bookworm is a fun little game. But that's exactly its problem: there's not much to it. All the game offers is a portable version of the free download that's been available on the net for several months. The only benefit on the Game Boy Advance is that it's now in a take-anywhere package, complete with cartridge save to record players' progress at any time. It doesn't feature any of the new enhancements added to the Deluxe edition featured on Popcap's website, including the faster-paced ~Action~ mode. As fun as the game is, its lack of any gameplay options is hard to ignore.  The GBA game is a great conversion of the web original with the same cute graphics and cartoony commentary from the worm on the sideline. The controls work well on the GBA's directional pad and button configuration, converted from the point-and-click interface from the PC realm. And it does feature a decent vocabulary of recognized three-or-more letter words, a testament to its extensive, built-in dictionary. But when it comes to game variety, Bookworm is a little hollow simply because the designers didn't go any further than offering a simple, portable rendition of the PC download.", "date": "Jun 16, 2004"}
