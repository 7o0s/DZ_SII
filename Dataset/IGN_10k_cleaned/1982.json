At the time, it was considered to be one of the better strategy titles on the list of soon to be released games. Unfortunately, it ended up running against heavyweights Command & Conquer and WarCraft II. While the game didn't sell awfully well because of the competition, it was generally fairly well received for its RISK-like way of dealing with resources in real time. Well the Bitmap Brothers are back again for some more fast paced RTS action with the sequel to Z called Steel Soldiers. They've made the jump to 3D and stuck with the same quirky sense of humor and style of game, but didn't manage to bring that little extra that really would call for this game to be considered top of the line.  The story puts you back in touch with some of the quirkier robots to grace your computer screen. Some of these guys are snobby intellectuals while others tend towards the ~dude, where's my car?~ variety of personality. Humor was a big part of the first game and tries to be in this game but misses as much as it hits. It seems that TransGlobal and MegaCom are having troubles with each other again and in the midst of peace talks, you and your troops uncover a bit of a scandal that could erode the fragile truce. So you set out to find out what's going on by making lots of things go boom.   While there were a few annoying things in the interface and a lack of diversity and style, the Bitmap Brothers still managed to bring a game out that can be pretty fun if things go right. The main problem with the game is that it doesn't always successfully manage to keep the frenetic pace that it was designed to have. As I noted before, the resourcing system in the game works like RISK. In order to get money to build and buy troops, you need to capture sections of the map by sending a foot soldier in to touch a flag that sits somewhere in each of the sections. Once you have the territory, you immediately start collecting resources without having to use grunts to harvest it. The catch is that the other side or sides, depending on what mode your playing, can decide to take them from you. The idea was to make it so that you are constantly fighting over control over those sections of the map. Each has a different resource value so that some are more valuable than others, so you would figure that there would be some pretty heated competition since you never run out of resources as long as you have territory.   Well when it does work so that there are constant battles to grab a foothold in sections of the map, it's a whole lot of fun. When it doesn't work that way, the game manages to sink back into the same old RTS mode of defending the resource patch and building your forces to grab the next patch. The hit or miss factor really all comes down to the design of the maps and the design of some of the units. When maps are fairly open and don't count on the destructible bridges that show heavily in some levels, you're going to be in for a fast paced treat of a game that has you scrambling to get your units around to defend key zones. But when maps are divided into islands with many bridges, it's too easy to dig in and set up good defenses that the computer will keep throwing troops into the grinder until you have enough troops to slaughter everything in your path.  When playing against the computer however, it's almost necessary to play that slow and deliberate way of playing to even survive. The computer and build and send troops at an insanely efficient level that can be really hard to take if you don't spend time defending and building up your forces. But if you do this, it's almost certain that you'll win. It's almost as though the computer AI doesn't really realize what to do about large defensive stances. Part of the problem is that there aren't really cost efficient effective ways to destroy defenses like you see in most games. There are usually is at least something like artillery and siege tanks to take care of stuff like that that doesn't take forever to build.  There also are some balancing issues because I managed to get through almost the entire game building only a couple of different units. One of the early robot units called the Tough can mow through almost everything without too many problems when you have enough of them because of their range, strength, relatively good firing speed, and low cost. If you spread them out enough mortar tanks won't damage enough of them to really make a difference and you'll have won the day before you know it.  My other major complaints come from the interface. They had said that they were trying to make it as easy as possible, but the sad absence of keyboard shortcuts for things like dropping troops out of transport helicopters quickly (you have to right-click on the copter to get it to land, unload the troops yourself, and tell it to take off again with the same right-click) makes the game a chore to play sometimes. There is a pause feature, but you can't give commands during the pause, which really should have been included when playing against the computer. But at the same time, there is the option to loop the production of units so that you never have to check back at your production centers again. It did manage to keep me focused on the battles instead of worrying about building units and structures the entire game.  Aside from those problems, they did have a couple of neat things that I liked a bit in terms of cool units. The sniper unit can take out drivers from tanks so you can take them for your own and spies can plant viruses into buildings and make them go haywire for a bit. The sad thing was that these units are hard to think about using because of the pace of the game in multiplayer and skirmish games. They're more timing based units for effect and its fairly hard to organize grand tactical attack schemes.  On the aesthetic side of things, it definitely has its good sides with some okay models and smooth terrain. I just wish the game had a bit more variety of color to it. Most of the levels are fairly uniform. Snow worlds, desert worlds, plain green forest worlds, volcanic worlds... you know, it gets a little dull. But effects such as explosions are pretty cool with buildings and vehicles exploding into a billion little pieces.   Sound on the other hand is pretty damn average at best. Most of the acknowledgments you get in the game sound exactly the same whether they be robots, vehicles, or naval vessels. There is very little variety in background music and the sound effects could have been from any game that I've played in my life.  But even with the problems that I mentioned, the game was a bit of fun for me which weighs in it's favor considering there are a lot of RTSs that I just don't have fun playing. Some of the ideas in this game are really good, it's just too bad that the execution of said ideas wasn't a little better and a little more time had been put into creating factions with differences (both sides use the same units). Those that liked the original Z will certainly get a kick out of this one as will many strategy fans, but those that are used to slick interfaces and lots of diversity in their gameplay might find that this runs a little dry for their tastes.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
