As a fledgling Etherlord it is up to you to master incantations and summoned creatures in your quest for, you guessed it, total world domination. The world of Etherlords is not domesticated, though. You'll need to fight to tame this wilderness -- if you have the time!  I found myself playing missions for hours with mixed results. Certain missions seemed like cakewalks, while others infuriated with illogical level design and unforgiving AI. It reminded me of the seven-hour games of Legend of the Five Rings I would play with my buddies from school... building up an army for hours and waiting for your opponent to make a move, then jumping him in a nail-biting battle. In Etherlords, defeat seemed a matter dictated by the game's designers and left me wondering why I just dumped four hours into a mission.  Etherlords is a graphical representation of a fantasy card game. You are assigned heroes in a lavish 3D world and tasked with establishing your territory and seeking out your enemies. Heroes gain experience as they win battles and each has a set amount of spells that he or she uses in turn-based combat with other heroes. The first round of combat gives the hero five randomly selected cards from his spell reservoir (like a Magic: the Gathering deck). Expending a spell recycles the card back into the reserve and decreases the size of the hero's hand. Each new round introduces a new spell to the hero's hand.  The game is played in two modes: strategic and tactical.   The strategic map is a 3D realm that is viewable through a maneuverable camera and is stocked with all of the elements and buildings needed for the upkeep of your heroes and their spells. Also located on the strategic map are your enemy's buildings and units, and neutral monsters. Your heroes gain levels by fighting monsters in combat and finding occasional masters that give your heroes experience for free. Depending on the level setup, you can go up in level fast or slow. Having a bunch of masters next to your castle (base of operations) can boost your heroes' levels early and give you a jump on your enemy, while an enemy with said masters gets the jump on you.  Tactical gameplay is represented on beautifully rendered 3D landscapes that change depending on the location, on the strategic map, of your hero's duel. The heroes (two to a battle) face off and cast spells. Spells can be of three types: creature summoning, enchantments, and sorceries. Heroes can not physically fight each other so they must create monsters or cast offensive spells to damage enemies. Other spells can be cast to add enchantments (magical bonuses or penalties) to friends and/or enemies. Duels last at least five minutes and are limited by a turn-based timer (heroes start to take damage after a finite amount of rounds have passed).   Having the right spell come out at the right time is an element of card games that takes a while to get used to and is well represented in here. As I played, I learned the pros and cons of certain cards and the right order in which to invoke them. Choosing the wrong order of 2 cards or issuing one wrong command can easily crumble your defenses and send you clicking for the reload button. You had better save the game often or you will be faced with making up territory that you had already cleared -- a task that could easily take an hour.  There seems to be only one configuration that ensures victory -- fighting against a much less experienced opponent. Every other fight is a gamble. Etherlords ships with 5 difficulty settings represented by an evolutionary track ranging from simian knuckle dragger to hunch-backed PC gamer. On the simian side of the difficulty bar, the computer is crack with his card use and unforgiving when it comes to your mistakes. I would think that the easiest setting would be mildly challenging, but reasonably EASY. The computer never made a mistake and always seemed to be ahead of me in levels. Imagine how hard it is at easy levels.  The learning curve in the game is pretty steep. Fortunately, the game has a decent tutorial system that outlines the basic mechanics of the world and displays properties of highlighted units. The game's manual offers additional reference with lists of the hundreds of spells and enchantments in the game. Simply knowing the capabilities of your own cards is a tall order and you can forget about knowing the capabilities of your enemy as his deck can hold any fifteen of over 60 spells.  Opting for the single player campaign seemed like a waste of time. You can choose between two ideologies: death and life. Being the champion of light that I am, I chose the life road. I listened to an absurdly voice-acted mission briefing and set off to destroy a mechanical abomination that trespassed into my forested territory (the clash between mechanization and nature is a cool theme in the design of the game). The mission was straightforward and easy and only took about a half-hour to best.   Then came mission two, which tasked me with the destruction of an enemy castle. I secured resources and went off to fight my enemy's main hero with my main hero. I found the enemy to have two levels on me in experience. This is a trend that seemed to maintain itself through the game -- enemies always ahead of you in levels. Perhaps the enemy started the mission with a more developed hero or was lucky enough to have a bunch of willing masters in its homeland (of which I had none), whatever the case may be, it made my job difficult to say the least.  The third mission tasked me with the destruction of two enemy castles (read that: two computer opponents), while defending a computer-controlled ally and myself. This mission left me with a bald head and a lap laden with the detritus of my once furred scalp. I might not have lost a year off of my lifespan by playing this mission, but I certainly did loose seven hours. There I was thinking I was doing grand, having just destroyed one enemy castle, when out of the other enemy's land came a hero nearly twice the level of my most powerful hero. I dueled the enemy and lost to his powerful attacks. As my prime hero was out of the picture and having only a couple of weak heroes left, the computer set about destroying my ally's castle. You would think my ally would be sending his units around, gathering resources and improving his lot in life, but he only sat at the periphery of his lands challenging a foe whenever approached (eventually loosing his heroes as our opponents surpassed his heroes' levels). I scrambled around that map two times, looking for the key to victory. I think I found it now but am thoroughly put out that it took me twelve hours on easy to get an idea of what needs to be done to win the stupid mission.  With a typical duel lasting at least five minutes and a mission involving tons of duels, you can only imagine how long the game takes to play. The game takes forever, but plays so smoothly that you hardly notice it -- except when you lose and need to redo everything! Then you REALLY notice it.   Multiplayer is almost as nonexistent in the game as the number of people playing it online. Right now, the game can be played over TCP/IP, LAN, and Internet-based GameSpy in a dueling mode. Players can set up parameters for a duel (which allows the allocation of spells and such to a hero) and fight each other in one on one action. There is no strategic mission multiplayer mode available through the game now, but Fishtank has announced a patch for the game, to be released early next year, which will include just that. There were less than twenty people logged onto Etherlords through GameSpy when I logged on earlier today. I suppose Fishtank is looking to invigorate the game's multiplayer appeal with the new patch, but I wonder if it will take. The turn-based nature of the multiplayer missions might make the game a bit too long and tedious. Time will tell whether or not people are willing to play it online in large numbers.  If Fishtank and Nival Interactive set out to bring to PC gamers the fun of card based games, they succeeded. They translated the complexity of deck building (setting up your hero's spells) and combat tactics (knowing which spell to use when) to the electronic environment with skill. The environments and character design are incredible -- especially if your computer has the power to fully realize them. The consuming nature of Etherlords adds to the games appeal, putting it down would be difficult.  Yet, the game can be frustrating. The level design is strange and the computer's ability with the card game is astounding. The inability to use a truly easy game setting cuts into the game's appeal. And, having missions that take hours upon hours to finish is a difficult feature to sell to gamers that may have limited time to spare.  -- Mike Murphy Want to share your opinions with the world?
