You would think sneaking around and fighting oversized ~intelligent~ bipedal monkeys would qualify as interesting, but then you'd also think getting hit in the face by a huge gorilla with a stick would hurt a bit more.  It's not that Planet of the Apes is truly bad across the boards -- just that it's truly mediocre. There's not a single instance where you'll genuinely be enjoying yourself. All of its fundamentals are either undeveloped or poorly implemented, and the underlying technology on which it is based is dated and drab.  The player takes on the role of Ulysses, an astronaut who, after traveling in space for what turns out to be a few centuries (which always sucks), crashes on a planet where intelligent apes rule primitive humans (which sucks even more). You now have to survive, discover the truth behind the ape/human reversal, try to reestablish the equality between humans and apes, and ~Restore humanity to the dignity enshrined in the Human Rights Charter~ (all of which will sadly turn out to suck the most). The whole package is more out of the original movie and book fiction than anything.   The game starts with a cutscene depicting the awakening of your space crew from stasis and the subsequent crash of your vessel. From there your team briefly spies some primitive humans and are immediately assaulted by a band of horseback apes (which is almost as scary as a similar dream I had, only not in an erotic way). Suffice to say when you awaken in a cell it already looks as if your crew is dead and you're in it deep (even deeper than crashing on an Ape-ruled planet I suppose).   Who could forget such a movie classic as Charlton Heston's Planet of the Apes? Of course the lesser-known sequels that followed are largely forgotten. Sequels such as the illustrious Beneath the Planet of the Apes, glorious Escape from the Planet of the Apes, timeless Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, and the always epic Battle for the Planet of the Apes. Okay maybe not entirely forgotten but that's still a lot of crap in such a little sentence. I remember staying home sick from school and often seeing some stupid damn version of Planet of the Apes and thinking to myself I'd be better off in math class or being ruled by an ape myself (as anything is preferable to one of the listed films and the even more audaciously awful made-for-TV flicks that followed).   At worst, even film enthusiast masochists wouldn't enjoy them, and at best they were mediocre. The same can be essentially said about this newest videogame incarnation of the fiction.  Graphically, Planet of the Apes looks as if it might as well have been called Quake 2, which wouldn't have been bad four years ago. But in 2001, the engine powering Apes is now decidedly dated and showing its wrinkles not just in the conservative use of colors and architecture (somebody really loves flat brown things), but also in the texturing and general complexity of both characters and environs seen throughout. There are virtually no outstanding graphical effects to speak of, aside from the pleasing, wall conforming shadowing on your character himself. The levels are for the most part barren and static.  Control is straight out of the Tomb raider school of walking and talking, sans all the more advanced functions that made that game passable. Walk, turn, crouch, run, jump, mantle are all present and accounted for, but offensive omissions have been made across the board. One of the most noticeable in this category is exclusion of any working strafe feature. That coupled with the jumping not being so much the death-defying Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia but more the I wish I were dead, ~Hey look at me I can climb a box~ type and you've got one underdeveloped implementation that only barely passes as playable.   For a game that's supposed to play as a quick combat/platformer/sneaker, there's a decisive problem with the collision detection which feels at times obtrusively clumsy. It's as if the bounding boxes around characters are a little too thick and jagged (you'll get caught and bump a lot of stuff). There's also some rather laughable camera work going on. For starters, the generally fixed view at shoulder level is for the most part acceptable, until you start turning or getting close to anything. See, turning (which turns out to be a vital part in the game...go figure) causes the camera to sway in the direction you're heading. It's cool in premise because you'd think you could even come out with a higher degree of peripheral vision. Turns out it's one of those cool-on-paper, nauseating-in-practice things that we hear so much about. In between sighs and yawns I found myself fidgeting in frustration trying to subdue an overwhelming queasiness. So long as you run straight it's cool though.  If, as the game claims, the object is to sneak around solving puzzles ad getting into combat, you'd expect that at least one of the three categories, sneaking, combat, or puzzles, would be good. Instead, we are left with sloppy AI, puzzles that require at least one functioning eye, and combat that's both boring and repetitive.  When combating apes hand-to-hand, the apes will seem drastically underpowered. Strange, because it negates the whole sneaking thing that was to supposedly be most prevalent here. Fortunately avoiding the erratic AI is far too boring a task anyway, so why the hell not fight everyone? In terms of hand-to-hand combat, once you engage an ape you press a button to attack, and the same button in conjunction with backward movement to block. Renegade on the NES had a more developed fighting system then this. All you have to do is just block an attack and throw yours in return. They spice things up a bit by throwing several attacks at you at once, in which case you'll have to hold a block, and then counter with several of your own attacks in sequence! Whoo... Gameplay! Sequentially pressing a button is usually far too hard a task for me to handle, but I thankfully got his one down in about, oh, seven seconds.   There's also the title's innate tendency to foul up the camera in all manner of bad ways when you get too close to people and things. Your character will actually turn transparent to offer a better look at what's coming, but for the most part, the only purpose that serves is to give players a nice gander at Ulysses' lips (they won't be so much transparent). There are certainly games with worse combat systems, but since this is supposed to be ~that~ type of actiony adventuring play, it's just unacceptable (I'm saying if it were an RPG it could be okay, but it's not, so bleh).  Inconsistent AI rounds everything out. For the most part the ape guards have that, ~I'm going to run at you until I'm dead whether I get stuck on every single wall or not~ mentality. Preset moments, like sneaking past a sleeping guard, are pulled off acceptably, but the rest is poorly done. There will be instances when you can crouch and walk directly in front of various apish denizens and you'll go entirely unnoticed, because I guess apes are too lazy to look down every once and a while. Other times they'll rush you right when turning a corner, which you won't know until it's too late, because remember that the control is lacking in about all ways.   Then there are the puzzles, the sweet, sweet puzzles. I love me a good puzzler, as Project Eden so recently proved, but after traversing the brilliant side of the spectrum, Apes is forcing my return to the funk (not the good groovy kind mind you). Hey, there's a tablet missing from there, maybe I should go get that tablet I saw and stick it in! Then there's the classic piano puzzle. Hmmm, what should I do here, hit the piano? Try and use my knife on it? Maybe that ~Insert Score~ marking right there on the side is some kind of indication as to what my next step should be? But hey, at least there's always the flicking of switches in sequence, and pulling of block-like things. The puzzles add nothing to the game but extends the boredom between combat; making the game longer than it should be and prolonging the mediocrity.  In all fairness, the title is not without its redeeming qualities: some of the animations are funny, and generally well done (some of the apes walk goofy), and as mentioned, the shadowing on your character is a bit cool. But the Quake 2 appearance, and the fact that it has been in development, at least according to the team's website, for over 2 and a half years time by a team of twenty, lead to a markedly disheartening and generally melancholy affair.   Planet of the Apes is a sadly drab and at best mediocre experience that fails to deliver in virtually every single category. Whatever redeeming aspects it may have had are marred by a plethora of inconveniences and annoyances that round out boring, repetitive play. Go to the zoo and pick a fight with a real monkey, I'm sure it'll be more fun.*  -- Ivan Sulic* Please do NOT pick fights with monkeys. They will fling poo at you.

Planet of the Apes is a decent side-scroller that fails to truly impress.  The game is very singular in goal, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so short.  I am a big fan of the Apes movies and it was great to see that the developers at Torus Games had actually watched the films and incorporated some of the story elements throughout.  If you want a quick ride through the Planet of the Apes, go ahead and pick up the game.  You won't be playing it for long.  Again, if you have a GBA, get the GBA version.", "date": "Oct 18, 2001"}
