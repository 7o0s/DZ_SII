Worms is one of those precious games, like Lemmings, that come out of nowhere (well, Europe actually) and just captivate everyone with their solid strategy and wacky humor.  Each competitor (there can be up to four of either human or computer ones) commands a squad of four heavily armed worms. Each worm takes turns choosing a weapon and firing at the enemies. There are projectile based weapons, like guns, and grenades and bombs. Each must be carefully aimed, as damage is calculated according to accuracy of the strike and type of weapon. The landscapes make this somewhat difficult, as they're all randomly generated junk heaps. ~Friendly~ fire is also an ever present danger, so weapon trajectory must be carefully planned.  Worms is a quirky, challenging game that deserves a look. Top stuff.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
