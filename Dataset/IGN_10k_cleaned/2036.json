See, we are not necessarily such big fans of 3D hereabouts.  Most of us at IGN, particularly the surly bastards that run the Sega and Sony sites, have been playing games for a long while.  We remember the days when bit depths and sprite colors were actually relevant hardware statistics.  We remember when games, save for I, Robot, were two-dimensional, and when they were better for it.  We also remember what happened round about 1994 or so, when some bastard we still can't quite figure out said ~Well, that's enough of that.~  I mean, who was it decreed that everything should have to be 3D all of a sudden?  Heaven knows, but it happened -- 2D graphics and 2D gameplay went the way of the dodo, and any developer who tried to go against the flow very nearly followed those principles into extinction.   Namco, bless them, is big enough to produce a little art for art's sake now and again, and that describes Klonoa 2 to a T -- it's a work of art.  Klonoa's creators use 3D as a means of expanding and refining classic gameplay concepts, rather than diving headlong into the cactus patch that is fully 3D platforming.  Yes, the game's on rails, but it works for exactly that reason, just as its predecessor on the PlayStation worked.  And now, with the aid of PS2 graphics, not only is Klonoa the star of a superior platformer, he's the star of one of the most beautiful games available.  Gameplay  Klonoa 2 brews up its own particular style of platforming, although you can pick out elements here and there from other games and franchises.  Particularly, there's more than a little Sonic Adventure in the sequel, with the addition of sweeping camera movements as Klonoa leaps, bounds, and occasionally flies out of handily-placed cannon.  Klonoa doesn't make some of the mistakes you see in Sonic Adventure 2, though -- the camera never gets so out of hand that you don't know where you're going, keeping its more violent impulses reined in when you're actually in control.  Dramatic moments like that are mainly reserved to spice up the game, rather than dominate it.  This is still a straight side-scrolling platformer at heart, and very much the better game for it.  The beauty of this design, which seems to have been forgotten of late, is that you always know where to go.  Just push continuously forward.  Too linear?  Not if you handle it properly, and anyway a straight test of reflexes is infinitely preferable to a test of figuring out which way you're supposed to go now.  When Klonoa challenges you to put on your thinking cap, it does so honestly.  As the game progresses, you advance from regular platforming levels to forced-scrolling surfing levels to areas with a very heavy puzzle emphasis, where you must figure out how to escape an area with the tools presented to you.  Klonoa's basic ability, of course, is to grab enemies, inflating them into projectile weapons or little jumping aids.  Puzzle rooms and levels present you with a certain set of enemies, switches, and barriers -- like a twitchy little chess problem, there's a way to use what's presented to flip all the switches and break down the walls in order to make it to the next area.  It's not much of a stretch in the early puzzles, but when the mirrored levels, multiple rooms, and Strider-style reverse-gravity areas come into play, it's definitely time to put on your thinking cap.  While the game, for the most part, is not the most intense platform challenge, it's likely more of a workout than most gamers have gotten in a while.  The bosses present some clever challenges, taking advantage of the closed arenas where you fight them.  Earlier stages are relatively easy to breeze through, but the closing levels demand serious precision to survive, though, and throughout the game there are plenty of easter eggs for those who are willing to put forth some extra effort.  Grab all the stars to unlock the hidden dolls and there are secret levels to explore, on top of the many forks and alternate routes in the regular levels.  Graphics  This is a textbook example of how style and artistic ability can make up for any number of technical shortcomings.  Viewed from a strict sort of poly-counting, texture-eyeballing, effect-nitpicking perspective (like the Gamecube editors dithering constantly over whether a game has bump-mapping and volumetric fogging and so forth), this is not among the first rank of PS2 games.  But aesthetically speaking, it's one of the most beautiful games on the system, because the artistic sense that shapes and guides it is so bright and original.  Klonoa's world unfolds like a child's pop-up book, as he traipese around the world map from level to level.  Here an island beset by stormy seas, there a jungle river full of surfing enemies and lurking wolf-sharks, elsewhere a snowy mountain to surf down, and in town man-made areas from a massive amusement park to a burning iron foundry.  Every area is brought to life by careful level design, effectively melding 3D backgrounds with the winding railed gameplay tracks to create areas that fit together as a visual creation as well as a platforming test.  That's evident from the very start, in the island level surrounded by rain and heaving seas.  The rocks and caves that lead to the goal spiral around in a complex loop that eventually leads to the island at the center, so the goal is always in sight, even if it doesn't seem as if you're headed straight there.  The characters look rather different from the areas around them, although it's not an unattractive contrast.  The backgrounds are all sharp points and angles, in large part a consequence of the need to save polygons, but Klonoa and his fellows are carefully shaded to create a smooth, full, rounded look.  It's nothing like the sharp, slightly harsh cel-shading of Jet Set Radio or Fur Fighters -- more like a soft glow than a bright sheen.  It gives them a remarkable degree of life and presence, as if they really occupy space and volume.  They're not just superimposed over the world, which makes the excellent animation all the more effective.  Klonoa's giant ears flap in the wind, he swims through the air, he tucks like a diver as cannons blast this way and that -- this is a very versatile hero, visually and otherwise.  Those cannon shots and other cinematic diversions scattered throughout each level are the icing on the cake, although paradoxically they probably took an awful lot of time.  Every so often, Klonoa 2 just tosses out a gorgeous sight purely for the heck of it -- lasting maybe a split second, but enough to make you sit up and say ~wow.~  When a network of cannons launches Klonoa from one end of town to another, with the landscape below all rendered to provide a background, the question arises: ~Why bother?~  And the answer, of course, is ~Because it looks wonderful.~  Which is more than reason enough.  Sound  Ah, the happy Klonoa music.  And the happy Klonoa sounds.  And the happy Klonoa gibberish language, which I can finally understand now that they've translated the game into English.  Ah.  Klonoa 2 has a lovely soundtrack, thanks to strong composition and a very eclectic flavor.  Light, rather ethereal tunes play in the early levels, when you're just getting into the game.  Later on, as you find your bearings, the beat steps up with a heavier sound, like the big-band horns and weighty bass that plays while you negotiate a town under siege.  Most pleasant of all, though, is when the composers cut loose with full-blown poppy silliness, particularly the Klonoa-sung snowboarding theme.  The words are utter nonsense, but the cheerful spirit of adventure would be there in any language.  Which is a lucky thing, since Klonoa and company, Panzer Saga-style, speak no language known to man.  The soft, fluid speech blends nicely with the bouncy effects, though, from Klonoa's shouts to the plop of bad guys going splat, creating a sound suite that blends quite well with the overarching cartoonish style. This is probably the giddiest piece of work I've written in some time.  Honestly, I feel a bit silly reading some of it.  But then it's mostly Klonoa's fault.Games like Klonoa 2 inspire a little more than ordinary fondness, though, because they're a reminder of what was good once, and what could be good again.  There's a level of potential in 2D graphics and 2D gameplay that the shift in design trends has left thoroughly untapped -- new technology could do an awful lot when married to classic concepts, and Klonoa is the proof of that.It'll never happen, of course.  The next Castlevania will be American-made 3D, Contra will stay in the grave Appallosa dug for it, Mega Man will come back with his very own 128-bit kart racing game, Treasure will go out of business after Stretch Panic sells all of half a dozen units, and it will be Polygons Uber Alles on every system made except for the Game Boy Advance, leaving all us surly old gamers cross-eyed and nearsighted from squinting in the dim light at Circle of the Moon.  Oh, well.  We'll always have Klonoa.", "date": "Jul 23, 2001"}
