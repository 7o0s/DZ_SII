This time, though, the company's working a theme into its value pack: for the third addition of Midway Arcade Treasures, Midway is reintroducing eight racing games from the company's intellectual property collection. On the surface, it may seem like a let down that this third edition of the compilation series cuts the usual dozen-plus quantity down to a mere eight. But in reality, many of the eight games within this pack can stand on their own, even in this generation of console gaming. Rush 2049, San Francisco Rush: The Rock and Hydro Thunder are the highpoints to Midway's most worthwhile compilation, and it's these games that make Midway Arcade Treasures 3 the one classic collection you just can't skip.   The absolute gem of this collection is without a doubt San Francisco Rush 2049. Even though the name on this package is ~Midway Arcade Treasures,~ the development team went the smart route and converted the infinitely superior version of the game that was created for the Sega Dreamcast system. Not a knock on the awesome arcade game, but the Dreamcast version, released in late 1999, was one of the deepest and most fulfilling arcade racers of its time, and experiencing it again in Treasures 3 shows how timeless the design is and how well it stands up six years later.     Rush 2049 was the sequel to San Francisco Rush, one of the most exaggerated arcade racers ever devised. The simple idea: race through the streets of San Francisco against a pack of opposing drivers while dealing with some of the wildest physics ever implemented in a racing game. Cars could, and frequently did, sail hundreds of feet into the air off jumps and bumps in the street, and San Francisco worked in this fictional recreation because, well, if you've ever seen this city, it's pretty cartoon-like in its terrain all ready. Rush 2049 took the familiar locations and thrusted them 50 years into the future, but in the end the game remained just as far out, crazy, and, most importantly, fun as it was in the original design.   When Midway chose to bring the game to the console six years ago, the development team didn't just port the game over. It improved it with new shortcuts in the track designs, and  added several modes of play that increased replay 100-fold. Players could now work through the ranks of the computer AI in a new Circuit Mode, which unlocked hidden tracks and additional features. Also added to the mix was a Ghost Mode where players could record their best run and save them as ghost data, which could then be uploaded to other players' games so other players could race your prime runs. And then there's Stunt Mode, a brilliantly simple creation that exploits the game's physics engine where players try to flip, tumble, and roll through the air for the best score possible. And last, and easily the best, is Battle Mode, a fantastic multiplayer mode where players drive in deathmatch arenas -- this concept was built upon in Midway's 2003 console release: Roadkill.   The game's conversion on the current generation console is nearly spot-on to the original Dreamcast build. Everything that the 1999 release featured is in the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 port, right down to the smooth framerate. There are more loading instances this time around but nothing out of the ordinary. The Xbox version remains the truest to the original with a 60 frames per second rate nearly 100 percent of the time, even in four player split screen. On the PlayStation 2, single player keeps 60 frames per second just as much, but kicks down to 30 for any two, three, or four player mode.    Along with the brilliant and highly recommended conversion of Rush 2049 is the contemporary follow-up to the game that started it all: San Francisco Rush: The Rock. Instead of simply offering an arcade port of the first San Francisco Rush game, the Midway Arcade Treasures 3 design team instead gave the go ahead to the ~sequel,~ which was, essentially, a track-pack update to the first game in the series.  The version included in Treasures 3 is a straight-forward port of the arcade game, but in the move from arcade hardware to home console the development team tweaked the engines to run at a higher framerate. Other than the occasional and very brief hiccup, the Treasures version runs at a fast, furious, and silky smooth 60 frames per second. And if you ever stumble upon the arcade version after playing the Treasures conversion, you may never go back -- the difference in motion is improved immensely.    The downside to the Rush: The Rock port is its lack of multiplayer support. In the arcades, operators linked up multiple cabinets in a network for player competitions, and this is something the Midway Arcade Treasures version loses in the transition. The arcade version never incorporated any code or interface for console-style split-screen gaming, so we can understand why the Treasures port lacks this addition. But it would have been fantastic had the conversion utilized the LAN port of the system for direct link play. As it stands Rush: The Rock still retains an enormous amount of fun in its design even without multiplayer due to the game's brilliant track designs and whacked-out, over the top moon physics.   This arcade-based single player limitation bleeds over into another game in the pack: Off Road Thunder. This, like Rush the Rock, is an arcade port simply because the game wasn't popular (or good) enough for a console edition. The concept of Off Road Thunder was to meld two of Midway's intellectual properties: it revived the rough-and-tumble dirt racing of Super Off Road with the Nitro-burning 3D action of Hydro Thunder. As a single player game it has enough merit in its game design for a few times around the track, but without any competition from human opponents the production's fun is limited. The arcade version wasn't exactly tops in 3D technology back in its day,  and its visuals definitely show their age more so than the other late 90s games in the pack because the port doesn't do much to pretty up the arcade assets and sticks with the original's not-so-smooth framerate.   But Hydro Thunder, like San Francisco Rush 2049, has been ported from the 1999 Dreamcast version for Midway Arcade Treasures 3, which means the game included in this pack offers the same single and two player support from the Sega console edition. And like the conversion of Rush 2049, Hydro Thunder's port in this compilation is right on with the five year old edition, retaining an enormous amount of fun and challenge in this arcade-frantic water-based racer. It doesn't offer as much gameplay depth as Rush, but the action is still enjoyable for one and two players.   The older old-school games in the pack, such as Super Off-Road and Badlands, don't suffer from the multiplayer limitations of Off Road Thunder and Rush: The Rock because the two and three player competitions were all handled on the same screen. The arcade to Treasures conversions are as spot-on as most of the 80s classic games were in previous Midway Arcade Treasures games, and their enjoyment pretty much depend on whether they have a special nostalgic place in your hearts. Both arcade games used free-spinning wheels with severe understeer, and most of the fun of these games were trying to get the cars in control using this floaty interface. Having direct control of the vehicles using the console's analog sticks or D-pads almost eliminates the point. Almost. There's still some enjoyment to be had in both these top-down racers, but they lack the fun and excitement that's had playing at an actual cabinet. But then, I guess that can be said for most arcade conversions.   And then we come to Race Drivin' and Stun Runner, emulations of two games utilizing the earliest commercial implementations of 3D graphics. Race Drivin' is the follow-up to Hard Drivin', the driving simulator already made available in Midway Arcade Treasures 2. The sequel's emulation comes through a bit tighter in this package, but it remains a very hit-or-miss design that you'll either ~get~ or you won't. I personally still find a lot of enjoyment value in the design, even with its crude and limited visuals, but others might not be willing to put up with the seemingly loose controls and sluggish sense of speed. Stun Runner, an action game based on the Hard Drivin' arcade hardware, features the same limited visuals but in a more straightforward (and faster paced) action design. This game might be more up players' alleys than the racing simulation since it's more twitch-based -- the emulation seems to have a looser grasp on the original's presentation, so you'll find the pace of the framerate varying wildly from one level to the next.Rush 2049 is the headliner of this year's pack, and even if it was released by itself it would still be worth the budget price that the Midway Arcade Treasures is known for. Because the version included is the brilliantly fantastic Dreamcast edition, even six years later this racing game holds up extraordinarily well with some of the most exciting single and multiplayer racing challenges ever created. The rest of the pack supplements Rush 2049 with a decent variety of racing games of both 2D and 3D designs, some more playable and addictive than others. The San Francisco Rush: The Rock and Hydro Thunder ports are still timeless and fun, but it's Rush 2049 that will keep you coming back to this compilation.", "date": "Sep 24, 2005"}
