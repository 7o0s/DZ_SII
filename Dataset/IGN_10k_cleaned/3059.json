{"name": "Egg Mania: Eggstreme Madness", "name_review": "Egg Mania", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/14/egg-mania", "text": "That simple little Russian puzzler Tetris is bound to keep inspiring new game ideas a bazillion years from now. Not only do several puzzle games have Tetris to thank for their foundation, but even action games like Rampart and the original GBA title Fortress are based around the concept. Kemco's Egg Mania is another game developed that lifts the Tetris theme for its design, while offering an entirely new structure for videogamers to enjoy. The console guys at IGN didn't seem to appreciate the game on the PS2 and GameCube, but the idea and presentation of Egg Mania is more tailored to the handheld market, which makes it a significantly more enjoyable package on the Game Boy Advance. It definitely won't set the world ablaze with its design, but it's a fun, graphically impressive little game that makes for one of those quick sessions on the GBA. Features Solo and Computer AI challenges Link cable support for two players (single cartridge) Cartridge save Only for Game Boy Advance Egg Mania is, essentially, Tetris in reverse. Instead of laying down the usual variation of shapes to create full rows to eliminate them from your screen, the concept of a full row is far more valuable because you must use it to build a tower of puzzle pieces that reach far upward. Egg Mania combines the ideas set forth by the forever-classic Tetris  with rudimentary platforming elements. As your choice of eight unlockable, egg-shaped characters (you can unlock more), you will physically grab the traditional and not so traditional shaped pieces as they fall from above. Simply tapping a button will send it slamming down in place below. You're able to rotate the piece in hand, of course, and a ghost image of it will display below to indicate where it will drop.  Very much unlike Tetris, though, you are able to fill gaps in your building if you have the correct piece. You are never unable to go back to an area and fill a gap. The difficulty comes into play because there are multiple pieces falling from the sky at once, which forces you to jump upon the structure you've built to reach the correct ones before they pass you by and plummet into the water below. If you can't fill your gaps, and have a number of them, the structure of your building becomes unstable. The ~wobble meter~ at the bottom of the screen will gauge how much risk there is that the unstable portions of the tower will crumble. If that happens, it will send several rows of work crumbling into smithereens below you. As your goal is to reach a hot air balloon high above you, you can't risk these kinds of setbacks.  That's it in a nutshell. Or rather, an eggshell. The single-player challenges against computer AI opponents are an absolute breeze to complete, and these challenges are over way too soon for any real lasting play. But the other modes, like the Solo option where you simply score as many points as you can, increase the variety of the overall package. And the game also graciously supports single cartridge multiplayer, so all that's needed to get a friend in the action is a link cable and another system. And playing against another player is way better than the pushover computer AI opponents HotGen programmed into the game.  Just by the game's look, it's obvious that this is a product of European game design: the vibrant sunset-style colors, the overwhelming use of parallax scrolling, and other 2D tricks ooze out of the Game Boy Advance as soon as you turn on the game. The limbless character design seems to be a nod to another European-developed game, good ol' Rayman. That's not a bad thing by any stretch...it's just interesting and neat to see Kemco, heavily Japanese publisher produce a heavily European-style game. It's cute, it's original, and it's fun, but Egg Mania definitely won't become a famous brand with its gameplay. As cool and amusing as the game is, Egg Mania does need to have a lot more to its design to earn that respected place in the ~Gaming Classics~ category. As it is, HotGen's design is just a good diversion for gaming on the go.", "date": "Oct 14, 2002"}
