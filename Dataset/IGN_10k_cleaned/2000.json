In the role of a commander of a high-tech cruiser with the ability to make weapons out of scraps of metal in a matter of seconds, I am the world's last hope of salvation. I am a force to be reckoned with. I am Dan of the Antaeus. I am cheesy. I am also happy with this game that offers a bunch of fun even if there are some frustrating control issues at times. It wasn't really enough to dampen my enjoyment playing the game, only my own stupidity was grand enough to do that, and you certainly can't blame that on any of the makers of the game.  In the near future, the world has undergone a momentous change. In a war to end all wars, the peace lovers won out over the war mongers and eradicated the world's weapons in an attempt to begin a new prosperous era for all people around the world. Machines that can make whatever people need out of different kinds of scrap are available for public use all over the place, hunger is gone, disease is gone, life is good. Well, for all of the normal people that is. There is one little group of malcontents that just can't seem to embrace the new way of life. They long to re-embrace the destructive and greedy nature of the past and bring it back where they can rule as kings once again. To this extent, this cabal stockpiled weapons towards that day that they could bring them forth once again and wreak havoc upon the world and grab control over a populous that has no means of resistance.   When the bombs start dropping on cities, the world's defenders jump into action. They send out a signal to the last functional weapon in their control; the Adaptive Cruiser Antaeus. Called from the depths of the ocean where it had been laying since the end of the last war, the Antaeus brings with it some enormous guns, a nanofactory allowing the instantaneous construction of weapons of war from nothing but scraps, and a pile of Soulcatcher chips each holding the consciousness of heroes from the last war. When you first gain control over the Antaeus, it's damaged and in need of some repairs, but as the game goes on, repairs are made and you soon have a fully functional floating fortress of destruction on your hands. Sounds fun right? It is.  Hostile Waters manages to grab a lot of great ideas from a few different genres and titles and throw them together with a fairly interesting story to create quite a likeable game. If you like strategy titles and love to get a bit of action in there on the side, than this may just be the title for you. The scheme of the game works on the premise that as captain of the Antaeus, you have the ability to generate a number of vehicles from the nanofactory by scavenging pieces of metal from the various islands that you float around. Once the materials have been scavenged via one of your vehicles aptly called the Scarab, you can build your various units. They come in the form of airborne vehicles like helicopters, amphibious vehicles, and ground based vehicles that will need to be transported from your carrier to the land either by you or the automated Magpie transport vehicle. Each of the vehicles can fit different weapons and has slots for different things such as armor, cloaking devices, and among other things, the all important Soulcatcher chip that holds that brain of a dead soldier.  Each of the Soulcatcher chips has a soldier on it. Each of these soldiers has a different personality and different specialty. Take Ransom for instance. He's one of the first you get, and a crack helicopter pilot. He's also a bit crazy and you'll see it in the way he runs head long into fights sometimes and the way he talks. So once you've fitted in all of the necessary components to your vehicles, you can start tackling the various missions. Before the missions even start, you'll get the opportunity to look around the island in the warmap section of the game (tactical map) and get the specifics of the mission so you know what kind of units to make and what sort of setup they'll need.  The actual process of setting up your vehicles is a snap. Drag and drop to the slots for the extra pieces and clicking on the icons of the various vehicles and weapons selects those. If you decide you didn't want that vehicle and it's still in on a launch pad, you can actually just drag and drop the vehicle to reabsorb it along with all of the energy you spent on it so there is no penalty for mistakes. In fact, even if your ship is out in the field, you can bring it back to the ship and have it and all of the resources you spent on it reabsorbed. You can only make four vehicles at one sitting as there are only four launch bays, but as soon as you move a vehicle off a launching pad, you can build a new one. I never felt limited with how many vehicles I could build except by the amount of resources I had and the amount of Soulcatcher personalities available to pilot them.  You can always build vehicles without the chips implanted, but that means that you'll have to pilot them in order for it to go anywhere. That isn't necessarily a bad thing though. There are several occasions where you'll want to be out in the action instead of your chippy friends. You can actually take control of their vehicles at any time as well by simply pushing the vehicle in any direction while you're watching them.  Once you have your vehicles up and ready to go, you'll probably want to give your orders to your units via the warmap. It's a nifty map used to give orders out while the action is paused. It gives you a moment to think about things in what can turn into a very hectic game, especially since you don't get to have precise tactical control over all of your units while the game is running. There is a command interface for commanding your troops around in real time, and while it is definitely good for certain things and a nice shortcut to bypass the warmap at times, it's pretty difficult to command your troops in the heat of battle effectively like this. This is mainly due to the fact that you're in the third person behind one of the vehicles so you can't see all of your troops and you can't accurately assess all of the dangers on the playing field.   But you can jump back and forth between your vehicles if you hear if they're in trouble and take a look at the situation that way. It's actually very simple to jump in between the various vehicles that are on the playing field. All you have to do is press the number of the unit you want to see twice or click on the icon in the top portion of the screen twice. You'll then be an observer to that craft where you can decide to take control or jump to the war room for some more paced decisions.  All of this is fine and dandy, but the game wasn't without its share of problems, almost all of which resided in the area of AI. The pathfinding in the game was very frustrating at times for the units not given the power to fly. They refused to go down steep slopes stating that they couldn't get to the location, yet when I took control of the vehicle and pushed it forward myself, I went over the edge fine without suffering damage. But even on some paths that seem very simple, the units will zig-zag their way across the landscape in what I like to call the Dance of the Drunken Dead Guy. Not only was the pathfinding wonky, but the decisions some of these guys made were amazingly stupid when it came to combat. Helicopters armed with only a slow recharging EMP pulse weapon would chase a unit into the middle of an anti-air emplacement nightmare. Dead... All dead.  Aside from that stuff, the dev team has done a really terrific job on both the graphics and the sound in the game. The visuals are really spectacular with day and night time giving you a different gameplay experience while at the same time giving you some new candy to give a look. Vehicle models are sharp and well textured with some nice weapons effects thrown in. The voices of the various Soulcatcher soldiers are also very well done showing off their very distinct personalities. Just a warning for those that are sensitive beings: There's a bunch of cussing here. I tend to like it, but some might not.   So finally, I have to give this game a recommendation for those that liked games like Battlezone. This is a great mix of strategy and action and should keep most gamers well entertained. There's a lot going for this title even through it's AI flaws and sometimes difficult command interface.  -- Dan Adams Want to share your opinions with the world?
