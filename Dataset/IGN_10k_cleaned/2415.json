This is unfortunate, because that means there's no little box to check in our database that properly covers Rez.  You could peg this game as a shooter in a very desperate pinch, but vast amounts of the experience spill messily out of that pigeonhole and run in all sorts of different directions.  Yes, you shoot things, but that isn't the point of the game, or at least not the way it is in most shooters.  The object of Rez is to appreciate the aesthetic experience, of which destruction is only a part, albeit an important one.  Does this make any sense?  Any game is an aesthetic experience, after all, even if most people wouldn't call them art for art's sake.  It's at least a rough attempt, however, to describe what sets Rez apart from the rest of the videogame market, since it most certainly sits far outside the mainstream.  It looks different, sounds different, and feels different from anything around, save perhaps the Tempest series, and even those never made as great a leap towards integrating the player's inputs with the sensory response presented by the game.  Perhaps there's what you need to grasp to get a strong handle on Rez.  It's about sensory response of all sorts, mixed so subtly with the player's actions and reactions that you hardly notice at times what a complex feat of design it is.  Don't be fooled by the simple gameplay, though -- this game took three years to make, and if you follow it carefully, you can understand why.  Sad to say, that effort may be wasted from a commercial point of view, but those few fans who sink into the rich aesthetic experience that is Rez will most certainly appreciate what United Game Artist has prepared.  Like they say, open your senses.  Let's go to Synaesthesia.  Gameplay/Graphics/Sound/Vibration/Other  Splitting an assessment of Rez up into separate little headings is silly.  That works for games whose different bits and pieces can be appreciated independently of each other, but the entire point of Rez is that it's all intgrated together.  Gameplay is tied to graphics is tied to music is tied to sound effects is tied to the pulsings of the Dual Shock in your hand.  As far as what you yourself do, it's relatively simple.  The actions you perform are those common to forward-scrolling railed shooters, like Panzer Dragoon or Starfox.  Your little wire-frame avatar is equipped with a lock-on missile weapon, which can be dragged over as many as eight oncoming targets.  Release the fire button and a cluster of shots streak towards their targets, the threatening glitch systems of a worldwide computer network gone bad.  Blast enough of these bad guys to discover the network portals and push through five different worlds, taking on a boss at the end of each one.  At this point, it sounds like Rez is a shooter, and yes, I'll allow that you could come to that conclusion if you were a very literal-minded sort.  Coming to that conclusion would involve ignoring what makes the game interesting, though.  Built out of a strange blend of wire-frame graphics and flat polygons that pulses continuously to a trance-inducing beat, Rez envelops the player like little else ever has.  What you're required to input is so simple, and yet what feeds back into your eyes and ears is so complex.  This was obviously much harder to design and program than it looks.  Every time you fire, and every time an enemy checks out, that registers as a beat or effect in the music track that backs the level.  Thus, the sound designers and game designers had to coordinate both of their creations such that every event in the game (triggered by the player, not in accordance with the game's instructions) landed in precise harmony with the beat.  In turn, the beautiful world around you reacts in turn, the entire screen continuously moving with the beat and sound effects.  If most of the fun of Rez is simply absorbing the sound and light show -- and a remarkably fine show it is, thanks to excellent work by a group of several talented electronic music artists -- it still offers plenty of replay value.  The challenge level is plenty stiff, even if that's due in part to the distracting visuals, and a great many unlockable features can be found by digging through the story and time attack modes.   In any case, if you could play through this game only once, I'd have to wonder where their soul went.  This is simply an amazing artistic creation to look at, listen to, and ponder, as you blaze through computer networks resembling all the ancient civilizations of the world.  The final level is either profundity or nonsense (you can take your pick), but regardless of which camp you land in on that question, the way it visually evolves through the early stages of life's development is at least an impressive feat of technical design.  Rez is so unique as to be almost impossible to compare graphically with any other game (you can hardly judge it in the same technical terms), but I might be tempted to call it the best-looking game I've seen on the PS2.  Call me crazy right here if you please.  Ridiculous statements of that sort aside, Rez looks, sounds, and feels great, and more than that, it's something different in all those categories.  The Wipeout series, in its most arty moments, perhaps came close to presenting the same kind of aesthetic, but Rez's simpler gameplay allows for a purer expression thereof.  You can't deny the skill of its visual design, and if you don't like trance music, well, it's your loss.  Quite a loss indeed.It's quite a loss, because while a great new sports game is fine, a great new racing game is fine, those and even a great sequel like Metal Gear Solid 2 lose in some small way to a great game that manages to strike out and do something new.  Rez begins with one of the oldest of gameplay concepts, but the ambition and skill of the artists that built up what stands around that concept allow it to rise far above what we normally assume a shooter is.Congratulations, then, go out to those artists, and those gamers willing to appreciate what they've created.  We hope you'll be back with something new sometime soon.", "date": "Jan 9, 2002"}
