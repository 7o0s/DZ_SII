In this film, he spent about 20 minutes on one sequence, the Pod Race. You'd figure he put this scene in the movie for the sole purpose of having a series of videogames to base their design off of  and wouldn't you know it, right at the premier of the film, Nintendo released Episode 1 Racer for the Nintendo 64. Six months later, the Game Boy Color gets a rendition of its own. But like the Nintendo 64 game, this racer has some great ideas  it just fails to excite like the scene that inspired it. Features 20 tracks Link cable support for two players Rumble Cartridge Only for Game Boy Color  The game design of the Game Boy Color edition of Star Wars Episode One Racer is very similar to the Nintendo 64 version of the game...if the Nintendo 64 version was fixed at a top-down perspective and if it only allowed one other racer on the track. The game still takes place over multiple planets in the Star Wars universe  the deserts of Tatooine, the ice tracks of Ando Prime, and swamps of Baroonda. In the game, you take control of Anakin and try and defeat your ~rival~ on each of the game's tracks. When you come in first on any track, you can take control of that track's ~rival~ alien and his pod racer  and each alien's Pod Racer controls and drives differently.  Since the game takes place in a top-down perspective, you don't really have that broad of a viewpoint  which makes it hard to anticipate approaching obstacles and turns. Thankfully, the developers had the foresight to include flashing icons at the top of the screen when there are hazards approaching  and they actually work really well. When a turn approaches, the icon turns from a straight arrow to a gradually curving arrow as you enter the corner  this eliminates the guesswork on when the turn is truly coming up. On a similar line, the blinking ~hazard~ icon indicates when a solid object is approaching, and in what direction you should be moving before it hits. The only time you don't get an icon is when the terrain changes from the fast track to the rough surface (like dirt in the sand, or grass in the swamp that slows you down).  The controls are of the simple Accelerate, Brake, Left Turn, Right Turn nature  but like the N64 version of the game, you can activate an Engine Boost when your speed reaches a certain peak. But it's only for temporary use, and will cause damage to your engines if you leave it on for longer than a few seconds. If your pod takes too much damage (from trackside obstacles, collisions with your rival, or engine overheating), your ship blows up and you're put back on the track with a lot of ground to cover between you and your opponent.  The game is fast, the controls are tight, and the race is challenging  but it's just not very intense. It's only you and the other racer, and your opponent doesn't really do much to win other than drive really fast. The excitement level could have been bumped up a bit with more opponents, track interaction, or even offensive/defensive attacks. But as it is, Star Wars Episode I Racer is a simple, straightforward challenge that's fun for a bit but then gets tiring since there's not much else to do than a one-on-one challenge. And since it's a race that's one trip around, there's no sense of memorization to make your second lap better than the first.   If the computer challenges get too dull you can hook up two systems via the Link Cable and battle a friend  but even here, it always boils down to the person who takes the lead stays in the lead.   Star Wars Episode I Racer isn't a bad game by any means. It's just not particularly exciting. The game has some neat surpises (just watch the introduction for an extremely slick five second video clip from the movie), but at the very core the game design is just too flat to be a ~great~ Game Boy Color racer. It'll just have to go on being ~better than average.~", "date": "Dec 9, 1999"}
