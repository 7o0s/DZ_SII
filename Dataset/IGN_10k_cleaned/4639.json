However, as this legendary title crossed into the record books, the search for the successor to its throne spawned almost as quickly. While some games have tried to figure out what made the town of Tristram so addictive to fight through, none have actually come close to its actual formula. So, at first glance, you might think that Encore's latest title, Sacred, is simply just another clone following in Blizzard's footsteps. Yet  it manages to capture some of the spirit of  Diablo better than most clones we've seen, primarily because of its vast game world, and a number of creative spins on the action/RPG formula that significantly boosts its replayability.  Granted, the initial story behind Sacred is one that you've probably seen or heard before. Once upon a time in the land of Ancaria, a Dark Elf named Shaddar ruled the land with an iron fist. Completely unscrupulous in his governing, it was rumored that Shaddar even had his own daughter sacrificed in rituals designed to prolong his power. Fortunately, the forces of good prevailed, and Shaddar was banished to a tower in the harshest desert in the land. As centuries passed, most people believed that the wizard-ruler had died in exile. However, Shaddar was merely biding his time, hoping to summon a Sakkara demon to help restore him to the throne. Thanks to a minor mistake, the Demon managed to escape during the summoning and wreak havoc upon the world, reviving an ancient cult in the process. On top of the danger caused by the liberated demon, the land of Ancaria seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Bandits and thieves now roam the roads regularly, while Orcs and Goblins launch strikes from the desert. The king has entrusted his son to quell the violence within his borders, who, in turn, has sent out a call for capable men and women to help save the land.  Here's where you come in, with tales of glory ringing in your ears and steel tightly grasped into your hands. Players choose from one of six pre-generated character ~types~ (although these can be grouped under fighters and magic users), each with their own unique character traits. The Barbarian is similar to most fighters found in other RPGs. As close combat specialists, these warriors wade into danger and often come out without a scratch. By contrast, the Wood Elf is definitely more skilled at long-range attacks, peppering enemies from afar with her bow. Vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat, her skills rely more on stealth and hit-and-run tactics. While more nature loving and peaceful, their disgraced brethren, the Dark Elves, are assassins. Wielding poisoned blades and traps, these shady characters are brutal fighters in combat.    Unlike most games, Sacred's Battle Mages are much hardier than other RPG wizards. Skilled with both a blade and elemental magic, these magicians can unleash the fury of nature from a distance or close to strike down an opponent. Sacred also has characters that represent both good and evil, with the Seraphim and Vampiress. Seraphims, descendents of warrior angels, can summon their ancestral powers to wield light itself as a weapon, empowering themselves against opponents. These abilities allow her to soften up attackers before she closes in for the kill. This is in direct opposition to the Vampiress, who has both a human and vampiric appearance based on the time of day. Thanks to her unnatural talents, she can make willing thralls out of her victims who will fight to the death for her.  As most RPGs go, each character has a set of stats that affect their strength, dexterity, etc. These are, for the most part, predetermined by character class and automatically raised upon each level, although players do receive points to boost specific stats as they wish. Similarly, each character starts off with two skills related to their character class and can acquire up to six more during their travels. Players can even tailor these skills to make up for a character's weaknesses, ranging from dual wielding to disarming opponents in combat. Barbarians can become proficient marksmen with crossbows, while wood elves can become skilled with swords.      There are two slight caveats with the skill system, however: There are only 26 skills in total, so the it's likely that you'll have one or more characters with overlapping abilities. Secondly, some of these skills either come too late or shouldn't count at all. For instance, the trading skill comes for some characters at level 50, and by that time, you should have more than enough money to take care of any trades you need. Similarly, the Constitution skill, which regulates how quickly you heal, wouldn't seem to be an actual skill but more of a character stat.  Why am I spending so much time going over the specifics of the character? Well, unlike Diablo, choosing a specific character determines where you start within Ancaria, as well as how some NPCs react to you within the game. What's more, each one will have their own reasons for embarking on their journey towards the garrison of Bellevue for the main quest. The Vampiress and Seraphim start in specific strongholds, the battle mage at a testing ground, the elves in the forest and the gladiator in an arena. However, players shouldn't feel beholden to making their way to the stronghold as soon as possible. A number of side quests, dungeons and other areas await, with monsters and loot.  In fact, the ability to abandon the main adventure in favor of journeying throughout the wilderness of the world is one of the strongest features of gameplay.  Sacred features one of the largest game environments ever seen in a game straight out of the box, supposedly with 70% of the world available for immediate exploration. Hacking and slashing your way through this land will definitely take you some time; I spent three days with one character trying to traverse a section of wilderness and discovered that I'd only fully cleared about three percent of the world! Towns will offer you horses to increase movement speed across open terrain, and teleportation portals can zap you from one area to another, but you'll have a ton of space to traverse before you find these outposts. Simply put, this game is huge. Thankfully, the game automaps every step of the way.    There are definite bonuses, though, for putting in the time to explore the land around you. There are magical hiding places scattered throughout the countryside that hold powerful items or weapons that can be used or sold as you see fit. Plus, the townspeople in the surrounding villages notice the work you do and offer you more experience and money as rewards for your troubles. You'll also notice that you'll cross the paths of the other characters as you take on certain quests. As the Vampiress, I stumbled upon the Seraphim on the verge of being sacrificed by Sakkara cult members in an underground ritual. Little additions like this make the adventure feel more dynamic and realistic than a static RPG.  The expansiveness of the world is a double-edged sword, though, as you may find yourself paying more attention to your explorations than the plot. This isn't too surprising, considering that themes of political intrigue, deception and salvation tend to blur together from game to game. It isn't helped either that some of the main quests are your typical rescue kidnap victim or weapon carrying FedEx messenger idea while the side quests are more diverse. It takes a substantial amount of time before you actually find yourself getting into the plot, but by that time, you've probably disregarded this in favor of crushing the next threat to your hero.    Speaking of threats, combat plays a huge part in Sacred, as you will confront everything from hordes of goblins or wolf packs to much stronger opponents like dragons and ogres. Like other action RPGs, clicking on an opponent makes your warrior immediately attack them, and you'll automatically close the distance if you're a melee character. Fortunately, the combat system has seen some dramatic improvements over other action-RPGs. First of all, you won't get carpal tunnel syndrome from constantly clicking on an enemy. Once he's selected, you simply have to hold onto the attack button to swing your weapon, until the target falls. Secondly, all combatants have their health displayed in a circle around their character model, which lets players keep their eyes on the battle at hand instead of monitoring their life bar. You can also hire henchmen during certain quests , so you won't have to suffer through waves of monsters alone.      The most significant facet of combat would have to be the inclusion of combat arts. These are character-specific powers that can bolster defense against waves of creatures, among other things. While you are granted a combat art to start with, you don't acquire them or strengthen them when you gain levels. Instead, you have to discover them by finding and reading combat runes that are scattered throughout the world. Some of these can be found in those secret caves mentioned earlier, while monsters carry others. But you  won't necessarily getting a rune tailored to your character; in fact, most of the runes you'll collect will actually be for other classes. Thankfully, these can be turned at merchants known as combo masters who can redeem these unusable items for practical runes. They can also help you develop combos--blends of combat arts, set up in sequences that can be automatically triggered via hotkeys within battle, for tons of damage.  While these combos can help you with some opponents, they do have a number of flaws. Actually, the combat system is problematic in general, which hampers gameplay to a certain degree. First of all, once a combo is established with specific arts, it's set in stone until you return to a master and tweak it.  Since the combos don't recognize any boosts to combat art levels except in the presence of a master, you may find yourself walking into a battle with a dangerously weakened combo in your repertoire, especially if you've tracked down a few runes since your last visit. You'll also find that it's not entirely necessary to have a combo in battle anyway, because most opponents can be dispatched by simply beating the crap out of them.  Regardless of combo, combat art or attacks, you will have to make sure that you're constantly giving commands to your character in battle, because they will have a tendency to stand around doing absolutely nothing while getting hacked to pieces. This is especially true when riding horses, as it seems to take forever to force your fighters to retaliate against incoming attacks. Complicating this system further is the fact that characters will sometimes poorly interpret a command you give them, running away from the battle instead of towards it. This can often lead you away from an easier battle towards a much harder one that you're not expecting. The pathfinding within the game, primarily during combat, can also be somewhat sticky, forcing a few re-clicks to put your character back on track. For a game with an emphasis on ~point and click~ combat, this should've been sharper.    The game world, however, gets more attention to detail, which you'll notice at first glance. You're not going to really manipulate the camera too much, with the exception of zooming in and out of the action. In fact, zooming in will sometimes blow out the textures on trees or other environments, making them appear somewhat pixilated and blurry, but getting a wider perspective of the world will show you that most of the world seems to go on around you regardless of your character's interaction with it. Woodland creatures such as rabbits and deer frolic through the bushes and villagers perform their daily duties. Impressively, animation for these, and other characters, comes across naturally, including the scurrying of animals or peasants if battle breaks out around them. Weather patterns, along with day and night cycles, flesh out the atmospheric conditions of Ancaria, and the game pays specific attention to ambient light sources, particularly lampposts and flames from torches. Unfortunately, object transparency is not transparent enough for walls and other obstacles, making it sometimes difficult to fight or navigate through dungeons.      Character models, however, are large and nicely animated, although player models are more detailed than the NPCs. Thankfully, Sacred has distinct art for each weapon and armor type you'll equip. It actually feels like your warriors are engaged in combat, as you'll see them swing their weapons in different ways for certain strikes or blows. This extends to projectiles also, and it's a nice touch to see fired arrows embed themselves in the bodies of monsters and remain there. You should also expect to see a lot of nice particle effects throughout the game, including spells, smoke from fires, and the bodies of the slain. Unfortunately for North America, the gore and viscera found in European versions of  Sacred has been removed, leading to replacements of sparkly evaporating bodies once killed.  Apart from the sounds of battle, Sacred features a soundtrack of orchestral music that rises and falls with each fight. Haunting at one moment, rousing and triumphant the next, the score provides a cinematic feel to gameplay. However, it's the voice acting that actually shines within this game. There are a few moments when it can be overdramatic, but it usually fits the onscreen action of the game. And the sheer number of comments and their delivery are particularly noteworthy. Your characters will remark on almost everything, from the safety of the region to a fleeing opponent in battle. I'd actually played for a number of hours before I heard my barbarian growl, ~I'm gonna cut you into strips, dry you and smoke you in my pipe!~ Needless to say, I couldn't help but roar with laughter at the absurdity of that statement, but it was a great line.  Players looking for fellow adventurers to travel through the land of Ancaria can engage in three multiplayer modes over LAN or the Internet. There is a 4 player co-op through the main story, as well as a separate Hack and Slash mode for up to 16 players. There isn't a particularly thriving multiplayer community for  i>Sacred like Battle.Net was for  Diablo, and potentially for a number of reasons. One could be that more people are interested in slogging through the single player campaigns of all six characters. Another could be the rampant number of server outages or maintenance sessions that plagues Sacred's servers, restricting the ability to connect to other players. While it can be engrossing to play with other gamers, there is an extremely noticeable amount of lag that can be found within games, even on high-speed connections or during LAN play.   There are actually a couple things I found fascinating within Sacred, both of which affected the gameplay substantially. The first was the preponderance of bugs, which I touched upon briefly in my remarks of multiplayer. Sacred shipped with a number of issues that either made it difficult to cleanly install the game or play at times. For example, there were a couple of occasions that the disc verification system that's launched upon startup locked up two machines I played the game on, requiring a full restart of the machine. There were other times that some dialogue boxes with NPCs were completely empty, either with  placeholder statements or nothing at all. It's unfortunate that these bugs weren't squashed before the game hit the shelves.The other was the extensive humor found within the game. If you took the time and looked, you could find a ton of pop culture influences, including StarCraft, Star Trek, and Lord of the Rings. Hell, I even found a parody of a comic sequence from Danny Kaye's The Court Jester! Many of these seemed to also pop up within tombstones or runic plaques, which would have some one-liner that made fun of RPGs or other convention. It's nice to see that the developers could take the time to fill their massive game with little Easter eggs like these to make players laugh as they explored this massive world.Overall, Sacred is one of the better action RPGs to come along in a while. There's a massive amount of depth, and the number of characters provides a lot of replayability. It also presents some interesting ideas that could be the potential direction the genre could go in. The somewhat clumsy combat schemes and ignorable plot are the two largest things that hold Sacred back, along with the instability issues.", "date": "Apr 12, 2004"}
