Not because of an aversion to gambling.  Hardly.  America loves to bet.  We'll bet on anything.  Five bucks says that old lady falls down.  Two bucks says if you push me down these stairs, I only break my neck.  No, the problem is that you really never need more than one.  Once you invest in a casino game that comes complete with the games you want--poker, blackjack, slots, roulette--you really never need an upgrade.  And that's the territory JAMDAT is staking out with JAMDAT Casino, hoping you invest in their gambling sim as your one and only casino game.  Features: Play blackjack, video poker, and slot machine Uh, bet fake money And, uh, win fake money  JAMDAT's casino sim comes with very few bells and whistles.  The visuals are just sorta there--they adequately portray the games, but do little above that singular goal.  No, JAMDAT Casino stakes its territory by offering several games in one, as opposed to many of the other gambling games out there that only offer one Vegas staple.  Blackjack is a fairly plain, but very competent game of twenty-one. All of the rules are in place, and at no point do you want to choke the dealer for cheating.  In fact, we've had far worse losing streaks at Mandalay Bay than while playing JAMDAT Casino.  Which is too bad, because only one costs real money.  Video poker is solid.  It plays exactly like a real video poker machine, meaning it sucks you dry and leaves you begging for more.  You always know that next hand is going to be better.  All of the rules of regular poker are in full effect, too, so none of that surprise-surprise! crap in the middle of a hand when you really you're playing some wacky version of Texas Hold 'Em, not Five-Card.  This casino, however, is equipped with only one slot machine.  One.  And it's of the basic cherries and fruits variety.  No fun theme, just old-skool spindles with the basics.  Does somebody else own the patent on sevens and bars?  This is also the only game that plays a little sounds, and it's only when the machine pays out.  Nothing while the wheels spin or when the handle is pulled.  Disappointing. While JAMDAT Casino is certainly not the end-all casino sim that you will cherish forever and make you give up that weekend trip to Vega$ (after all, there's no Olympic Gardens sim included), it fares far better than most by offering more than one casino game.  It would have been nice to see some themes, maybe a real-life casino sponsorship like the Grand, and some more sounds... but them's the breaks.If you dig on casino games and can amuse yourself for hours playing with an imaginary slot machine that pays out bumpkiss, here's your next download. Personally, I think casino games are totally masturbatory, as you never actually win any money, so what's the point of playing?  You can get excited about saving the princess.  You can get pumped about ridding the galaxy of evil.  Winning a million fake dollars?  Yawn.", "date": "Sep 27, 2003"}
