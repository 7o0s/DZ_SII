I mean, how could a completely free-form space combat/trading/exploration/basically-anything-you-can-think-of uber simulation not appeal to your typical avid gaming fan?  In fact, I was excited enough to even forgive Battlecruisier Millennium's controversial designer Derek Smart for the original Battlecruisier, by most accounts a prematurely released, bug-ridden disaster. Well fortunately for Smart, the gaming community was willing to forgive his earlier blunders and keep an open mind (and consequently, an open wallet) towards the latest installment into his series.  Since Battlecruisier Millennium is so epic in scope and rich in depth, it is hard to generalize the game's essence in a mere paragraph.  Just imagine having an entire completely interactive universe (complete with over 200 planets and moons), a potential arsenal of nearly 50 crafts (ranging from gigantic carriers to petty land-rovers), complete ship control, and a whole mouthful of other features.  On top of that, you have the option to pursue one of 13 careers as one of 12 races.  Okay now you may ask, ~Those are some pretty impressive parameters to play in, but what exactly can I do?~  Well, you can basically do whatever the hell you want.  No, I'm serious. Want to get down and dirty with some alien scum?  Just pursue a career as a military general and go around whomping every enemy ship in sight.  Is combat not your style?  Then take on the role of a trader and mine the moons of Jupiter for valuable minerals and resources.  Hell, you can even set up a roaming space brothel to attract famous pilots from around the universe. Okay, we made that last one up, but you get the picture; the possibilities in BCM are seemingly endless. If this whole ~freedom~ concept isn't your thing, then just latch on the game's more directed campaign mode and take it for a ride.  See, doesn't this all sound great?  Was it such a crime to get my blood pumping over this title?  I mean, in theory BCM is a space freak's dream.  However, to paraphrase a wiser man than I, ~In theory a free-form space exploration works...in theory~.  Unfortunately, BCM falls shorts when it comes to its archaic graphics and a learning curve that would give even Einstein a throbbing migraine.  And unfortunately, the gameplay, which sounds great, can often times be dull and frustrating.  When I first fired up Battlecruiser Millennium and saw the options available for the free-roaming career mode I couldn't help but salivate.  I was faced with more options than my pretty little brain could handle -- numerous potential gaming experiences awaited and all I had to do was decide what race, caste, and ship I wanted and I'd be on my way.  I played it safe and chose to be a Terran commander with a standard BC carrier -- a path well traveled but always worth the walk.  And then, as expected, I was plopped right in the middle of space just outside of a space station hovering Earth.  Man was I excited.  I imagined exploring distant galaxies, doing some dirty work against a rival faction and taking part in a handful of other adventures that, you know, people regularly experience in space.  But much to my disappointment, I spent the first couple of hours aimlessly wandering around our solar system in search of action that apparently wasn't available.  Unfortunately, this seemed to set the tone for much of what followed.    It wasn't until I took a couple space gates over to the Alpha Majora galaxy that I began to delve into the heart of BCM's gameplay.  Right when I was about to enter a wormhole (one of my waypoints -- conveniently plotted by the games commlink control center) I was attacked by a band of Aurora fighters.  This is where things got interesting:  I immediately launched 2 of my 4 fighters and activated my weapons armament to help ensure a complete victory.    Much to my surprise, the combat interface was very easy to navigate and it only took a matter of minutes before my fighters, backed by a couple carrier-launched missiles, took out the enemy fighters.  While the battle scene was hardly flashy, it was organized and orchestrated well enough to get my blood pumping.  Unfortunately, the rest of my journey across the galaxy was filled with those aforementioned lulls that slightly weigh the gameplay down.    From that point on I engaged in some interesting activities, such as trading a precious mineral from Alpha Centauri for a profit on Majoris, upgrading my hull shields and weapons system, and visiting nearly every space station I could find on my radar. There really isn't a defined limit on what you can and can't do in BCM.  Assuming you don't get killed in action, you have 65 game years to essentially role-play your character (caste/race) into the ground.  Opposing factions and enemy races will attack you along the way, you may get swindled by a bum space-dealer and you could even find yourself stranded on a distant moon if you're terribly unlucky.  That's where the beauty of BCM's gameplay lies:  while it's technically classified as a space simulation, it is more justly referred to as a space role-playing game.  If you make an effort to follow your role, you will be rewarded with a long and rich gaming tenure.  However if you're just looking to get some instant action, BCM is definitely not for you. Especially considering how lackluster the game's first-person shooter mode is.  Now these lulls wouldn't be too bad if I had some nice, epic space visuals to feed on along the way.  Assuming that I paid attention in Introduction to Physics, I learned that the universe is composed of three independent dimensions:  the Y plane, the X plane and the Z plane.  Well then, if BCM claims to be a ~universe simulation~, why do all the planets and moons look like 2D, pixilated vanilla wafers?  All right, so I'm exaggerating a bit, but it is disheartening to see such a plain and dull atmosphere because, in order to fully immerse yourself into the game's free-form style of play, you must be pretty darn convinced that you actually are part of the universe.  However, to BCM's credit, the crafts, space stations and a few space effects are crisp and nicely detailed.  The main area of BCM's graphical struggles lie in its visual presentation: most notably the dark, unfriendly in-game interface.  The game understandably cuts down on the bells and whistles to make room for an extremely comprehensive control panel, but a few decorations here and there would have made a huge difference.  After a couple hours playing the game, the bridge view of outer space becomes quite an eyesore.  Similarly, the menu screens and ship option panels are lifeless and barren.  Graphics can be somewhat neglected so that the designers could concentrate their energy into making a clean, intuitive interface.  And while BCM does make an enormous number of ship options and commands accessible in fine, logical fashion, the game's controls possess a learning curve steeper than a San Francisco street.  If you make use of the game's extensive command sheet (and can decipher the tiny print), you can gain a reasonable understanding of the controls in around 2 hours.  But if you're bold and just want to pick the game up and play, forget about it!  Experienced and dedicated space jockeys may find the interface to be delightfully expansive and easy to use.  But if you're a casual simulation fan and appreciate concise controls, your brain will undoubtedly explode.   If you are, in fact, able to stomach the lack of atmosphere, master the interface and make your way through the lulls in gameplay there is plenty of gaming muscle here, assuming you have the imagination (and the patience) to explore the game's wide range of possibilities. While I can't whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone but fans of the genre (space super sims), I can say that if you're up to the challenge of taking on BCM, you may find the wide array of experiences to-be-had right up your alley.  -- Michael Perlo      Want to share your opinions with the world?
