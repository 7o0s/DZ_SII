I confess to being a Might & Magic addict right from the very first series release, an intensely ugly PC port from the original Commodore title.  Things improved visually after that, and I enthusiastically reviewed M&M II for a long-departed magazine (which pretty much defines most computer magazines, these days).  Just before M&M IX arrived I decided to go through a regimen of rigorous training.  I'd awaken at dawn, place fifty pounds of stones in a backpack, ignore the backpack, and go back to sleep.  Then I'd get up several hours later, refreshed, and play M&M III, IV, and VII.  Sure, the graphics of all these products have aged, but none of the core gameplay itself has gone sour.  They were addictive products, and they still are.  They also had a real sense of continuity.  Not so much in the repetitive storylines (with their fantasy spells and swords giving way to spaceships and laser beams), as in what you could expect from the next M&M iteration.  It was a comfort, a sense that however much things changed and hopefully improved, certain values would remain untouched.  But that's not the case, any longer.  You know the old film/anime/comics/novel fantasy theme involving a mirror that produces a living, reverse image of whatever looks into it, right?  So I don't need to explain to you that when I refer to M&M IX as a looking glass Might and Magic, you'll know what I mean.  The latest release in this venerable series does well what it used to do badly, and neglects so much that older releases did ever so well.  The most surprising thing about it isn't the much touted 3D Lithtech engine, fine as that is, but the fact that they named the results Might and Magic.  Let's start with the plot.  A large army led by the valorous Tamur Leng is on its way, intent on crushing all six cities of medieval, Scandanavian-flavored Chedian.  Your goal is to bring its six major cities into an alliance which can face the hordes, and win.  There's no deadline for this, however, which is very obliging of Leng.  You can take your time and build up your party, while performing the various tasks that the cities' Jarls (mayors) decree.  The basic idea has merit, with implied strategic options that could have been fun.  For example, it would have been neat and improved replayability if you had to form an alliance of say, five out of seven cities, each of whom brought you a different major benefit, so that any one game might be considerably different from another, depending upon who was in your final alliance and who was out (the discarded cities teaming up with your enemies).  None of this unfortunately figures into M&M IX, which simply requires that you fulfill all the tasks assigned to you.  The graphics are very good -- with reservations.  The new Lithtech 3D engine gives M&M IX a much-needed facelift.  This is most apparent in surface texturing, weather and lighting effects.  It's great to see the sun as a bright, highlighted blob through a stained glass window inside a temple, or to watch a tradesman moving about inside his shop, as you look through a window.  There's still the problem with flat, pixillated surfaces up close, and the geometric edges of mountain and foliage surfaces are very prominent.  The engine also seems incapable of supporting 3D objects with a flat surface.  Several times my party has been halted by and forced to walk around a piece of paper or similar object lying on the ground.  It's a minor nuisance, but it's the kind of thing that adds up over time.  Each monster type looks far more distinctive than in past M&Ms, though it's annoying that the developers still show an increasing level of power in some monsters of the same basic type by coloring them differently.  Would it have been too hard to make tougher versions of the same creature (like imps and elder imps) a little larger and more intimidating in appearance -- assuming any visual difference was needed?  That's what the Identify Monster skill should be for, after all.  And that's just how Wizardry 8 uses its own version of that skill.  It makes good sense.  M&M IX's 3D animated figures, both NPCs and monsters, are represented by flexible models with stretchable skins.  The benefit is that friends or foes you meet move very naturally, even when the animated routines are kept to a fairly small number.  The drawback is that their faces never change expression, so that they don't open their mouths, blink their eyes, raise eyebrows, etc.  I can accept this from basilisks, forest giants and the like, but when you see it in all the inhabitants of a city, the effect is of walking into a medieval version of The Night of the Living Dead.  I wish the developers at New World Computing had found another solution to conversation with a person that gets angry or happy yet keeps the same expression.  Even bags over their heads would have been less creepy.  For that matter, I wish NWC had furnished more faces and body types.  There are very few in M&M IX, and they repeat endlessly.  You're always running into the same people with different names, even in the same city; and since there are very few people in each city (which gives the larger ones the unintentional feeling of ghost towns), it's extremely noticeable.  The guy who dislikes being talked to looks identical to the guy who runs a shop, to the guy who teaches a skill, to the guy who hangs around outside the bank and talks about how he hates people from another town, etc.  Go to the next town, and you see six more examples of the same face, out of twenty inhabitants.  It's almost as though the entire culture were the result of a massive inbreeding program.      The cities themselves are much larger than before, and unlike cities in past M&Ms, this lot comes with plenty of empty space.  Instead of each building serving a specific purpose and housing a single room, there are tons of inaccessible buildings and plenty of extra rooms, corridors and stairways inside accessible buildings.  The latter remind me of Daggerfall: beautiful to look at, filled with things you can't interact with, and utterly pointless.  I'm sure a lot of time was spent creating them and their contents, and I suppose we can admire that.  Personally, I feel about the useless rooms and buildings the way I've always felt about cutscenes (at least, until the final one denoting your ultimate success in a game): I don't care about them, since they don't affect gameplay.  They're so much wallpaper.  Mile after mile of nothing but wallpaper grows frustrating after a while.  In fact, there's a lot less that's interactive in M&M IX's environment than in the three preceding games from this series.  For all their lack of visual charm, M&M VI-VIII gave us a Fly spell, cabinets, desks and shelves containing plenty of treasure and hidden levers, and statues and pictures you could take, move, or put on top of other suitable objects.  None of this is in M&M IX.  Alchemy components have been removed from the ground, as well, because the alchemy system itself has been eliminated.  Nothing has been put in its place.  The character screens have been changed, and mostly for the worse.  Previously each character had a paper doll that you clothed in items that were all sized to fit.  This created a sense of accomplishment when you moved from that cheap, dull-looking chain mail into something highly burnished and beautifully crafted.  Now, the items that your characters find are all represented by tiny thumbnail icons with hardly any differences among them.  These are placed in boxes attached by lines to portions of a drawn character body.  Nothing looks or feels special.   Then there's the notes screen.  Remember how in previous M&Ms important information you discovered was broken up by category?  The locations of skill teachers were under one tab, while the colors related to different permanent barrel potion effects were under a second, fountain and pedestal effects under a third, etc.  All notes share a single page, now.  Fountain and pedestal effects are no longer listed.  If you want to track them, you track them outside the game.  Unlike BG2, there's no ability to keep your own notes within M&M IX.  That brings up another drawback to the game: its mapping system.  M&M VII let you right-click on maps of cities you'd walked through, and get a brief description of a building's contents.  M&M VIII added self-notations.  M&M IX eliminates all of it -- in fact, you can't even scroll the maps to see areas that moved off-screen.  Given the tangle of several dozen buildings that form many of the empty cities, you really feel the absence of that self-annotating system.  Gameplay isn't that different from other RPGs.  You get quests, explore, kill things to fulfill quests, sell goods you've found, train up your skills, hopefully find something to raise your characters' statistics (might, accuracy, speed, magic, endurance, luck) and repeat.  The ~new~ professions system in M&M IX isn't really new.  M&M IX simply offers fewer professions when you start (Might, or Magic) and then lets you twice refine that choice later in the game into one of several M&M professions that have been part of the series for a long time.  For example, an Initiate can train to become a Healer or a Scholar; the Healer than chooses between a Priest or Druid, while the Scholar chooses between a Mage or a Lich.  All four final professions were in M&M VIII.  Just as before, you still have to end up promoting your characters through quests to get them access to better spells and more developed skill levels.  The skills system itself remains intact.  This consists of weapons, armor, and miscellaneous (repair item, identify item, etc) skills which all begin at the basic level.  You train up your characters' levels as they gain experience through combat and quests, and that translates into added skill points.  When a character has enough points (and the money required), different trainers can create Experts in a given skill, then Masters, and finally Grandmasters.  Curiously, while Expert through Grandmaster level promotions remain in the hands of trainers found scattered throughout the various cities, the basic level has been moved out of stores (where it was in the last three M&M games) and into books that you find as treasure.  I'm not sure I understand the reason for that.  I understand even less why the dragonflies you kill on the Isle of Ashes, or outside Sturmford City and Drangheim, almost all carry plenty of skill and spell books.  Skeletons -- sure, I could understand books in their inventory.  Maybe they like to do a little light reading while moldering away the hours.  But dragonflies...?  Unfortunately, M&M IX's manual (which is among the worst I've ever read -- and since I go back to the 13th century, that's saying something) doesn't list the skill caps associated with a particular profession: a Druid's inability to learn the Cudgel skill beyond Expert level, for instance.  You can see these when you're first creating your characters, because all the skills are listed.  Right-clicking on a skill gives you a chart of the professions, and how high each one can learn a given skill.  But once you're in the game and faced with whom to give a new skill book, you have no way of knowing which professions in your team will take it farthest.  Wellactually, you do have a way.  Save your game, start a new one, then check right-click on all those skills listed under character creation.  Real ease-of-use, there.      The new spell system rates high, though.  Instead of separating out spells like the last M&M games into a series of schools (Mind, Body, Spirit, Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Light, Dark), all spells require training in two or three out of four schools: Light, Dark, Elemental and Spirit.  Say you want to learn the Fleet Foot spell: you need to have Basic knowledge of Spirit magic, and Expert training in Elemental magic.  The spell list itself has also been reworked.  Quite a few old spells remain, and at least one major spell that was removed after M&M VI, Moon Ray, is back in all its destructive glory as Souldrinker.  (It sucks hit points out of everything in sight, and transfers it into your party members.)  There are also quite a few new spells with attractive visual affects, like Chain Lightning, and Phantom Fighter.  Up to three NPCs at a time will now accompany your party, and fight for you.  Some are free.  Others charge, usually by the month.  The idea is good, but the implementation is problematic.  You can't look at a party NPC's statistics, skills or inventory, which makes hiring a new NPC something of a guessing game even after a few battles.  You can't train them, either.  Wizardry 8 handles this better: if you take on an NPC, you get complete control over that character while they're with your party.  (And you can't ripoff their best items, either.  The NPCs won't let you get away with it.)  Party formations have been added.  You can position your party members in up to three ranks, provided the front rank is entirely covered.  While M&M IX doesn't let you store a series of formations for easy recall, it's still a handy tool for keeping that spindly mage of yours out of danger while your melee types butt heads with whatever giant beast is slobbering in front of you.  While the regular game proceeds in realtime, combat can be switched between realtime and turn-based with the ENTER key.  Combat itself is much more interesting than in past M&Ms, thanks to much improved enemy AI.  M&M mavens will remember when monsters simply advanced without thought, and later games in the series added their ability to retreat when badly injured.  M&M IX goes much farther, so that monsters will sidestep attacks, cast from a repertoire of spells, and seek to maneuver in 3D space for advantage.  They'll even heal or resurrect one another, if the spell and is available and opportunity presents itself.  There are fewer enemies, but they're considerably smarter, and make dungeon crawling a lot more exciting than of old..   As you can tell, my reactions were largely positive to the combat and graphics engine in M&M IX -- the weakest points of the recent series, until now -- and negative to a lot that was done so well in the past (mapping, interactive environments, notes, inventory, skill display, etc).  But what's most disturbing about M&M IX is the feeling that it's an unfinished game.  This isn't a clever observation.  The scent is about as subtle as decaying vegetation in a sewage plant.  For one thing, the bugs are numerous and huge.  There was a chest that relocked itself and gave out perpetual randomized items within a relatively short distance of my party's initial arrival point in M&M IX.  The Wizard's Eye spell actually provided me with less information about my surroundings when cast on a higher level.  Bankers complained about the absence of orbs, after I'd installed them.  I couldn't even complete the first plot-related quest in the game because of a bug.  The dialog has many poorly worded sentences, and a few with extra characters.  The game feels empty.  Some features are missing, like map annotation, and others have been eliminated without replacements, like alchemy.  Arcomage, the in-game cardgame that was so much fun from M&M VII-VIII, is gone, too.  I didn't expect it at the beginning of a new M&M series, but I'd hoped the development team would come up with a good substitute.     What did you think of Might & Magic IX?  Then there's the promotion quest from Initiate to Healer, in Guberland City.  You're asked to remove the madness of the strongest man in town, which requires a potion.  That in turn involves getting a lock of hair from an old hag who lives in a nearby cave.  Now, you and I would expect a few dangers along the way, right?  Some monsters, maybe a hidden door or two, a couple of traps: standard hero fare.  Not so; in fact, there's just a tiny trip to a very small cave -- and guess what?  The lock of hair is lying on a stool, right next to the hag.  How very convenient!  You don't even have to talk to her.  But if you do, and decide in the end you want to attack her, she won't fight back or even move.  You can just kill her.  Nothing that important should be that easy, and it certainly looks like a hastily tied-together excuse for a quest to me.  Bugfixes are already on the way, but that's hardly the point, is it? Since finishing this review, I haven't played M&M IX.  Not even once.  This is a first for me.  Even M&M VIII, which I thought was a duller, shorter version of M&M VII, kept me more engaged.  The only time I felt the old need-to-play assert itself was in the M&M IX's dungeons, which used to be only mildly entertaining in M&M games.  Combat is much improved, and a real challenge, now.  However, every other activity has been reduced to a chore, against a frustratingly attractive but noninteractive background.Generic is a good word for this game.  It's got reasonably good balance, fine graphics and exciting combat, and the old sense of humor is still there in out-of-the-way places (Robert and Douglas, Ludwig Van's Beet Hoven, etc).  But the wild imagination and pull of distant desirable goals -- to walk on water, to fly over inaccessible mountain peaks, to visit far off cities only hinted at in the early game -- is gone.  Certainly playable, M&M IX just isn't memorable.", "date": "Apr 12, 2002"}
