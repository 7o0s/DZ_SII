When received our final copy of Hasbro's remake of the 80's classic Missile Command, that soft spot manifested itself in a head first dive for the game box that was followed by repeated growling noises. After all, Steve grabbed Pong when I wasn't looking, and he had a blast with both Hasbro's faithful recreation of the original title and their cool new take on the game. Unfortunately, when I actually got Missile Command installed, I found it lacking in a lot of the originality and faithfulness to the game's roots that had made Pong such a hit. While I still had a lot of fun with the original mode of the game, the new 'ultimate' mode left quite a lot to be desired.  Unless you just discovered video gaming yesterday, you're probably already familiar with the basic idea of Missile Command. Aliens have attacked, and rather than doing something stupid like blowing up the White House or creating pod people, they've decided to perch their saucers in the outer atmosphere and start pelting cities with missiles. If the aliens in the X-Files ever figure out this strategy, it's going to be a short season. Not satisfied with getting blown up, the governments of the world decided to team up and fight back with missile launchers of their own (building some sort of shield would have been too obvious). In the classic mode of the game, all this background info is just sort of understood, but in the new ultimate mode, you're given a handful of plot animations that shows your team of three missile tanks scrambling all over the world defeating the alien attacks (for some reason they don't go back and attack areas that they've already made a try for).  The actual game itself hasn't changed much. You move a cursor around the screen with your mouse to aim and click the left mouse button to fire. In the new ultimate mode, several special aliens have been added that will attack your cities or missile tanks directly if you don't take care of them fast enough. Other new additions to the ultimate mode include a screen that scrolls a bit to the left and the right (which means that you'd better be paying attention to your radar  missiles can sneak down the sides of the screen), an economic system (more on this later) and bosses. This last addition was really what bothered me the most about Missile Command. While I really like the idea of breaking up the stages with bosses, the end stage critters in this game are ridiculous. The actual gameplay sections of the first, second and third stages were a breeze, I finished them all with no losses, but I had to face off against the end stage bosses about a dozen times before I could claim victory. I wouldn't mind this at the end of the game, but the bosses should match the skill requirements of the levels they are attached to. Aside from the fact that they're ridiculously hard, they're also pretty dull  each one of them works pretty much like all the others did, it's just a matter of figuring out which order to take out your enemy's weaponry in. Whatever. I hated 'em.  The economic system on the other hand was really cool. As with the classic game you earn points for each enemy you kill, each city you save and the number of missiles you have left after a level is over. The real difference here is that those points translate into dollars that you can spend at the end of the stage to improve your missile tanks. You can spend your cash on bigger explosions, more missiles in each base, faster travel times or a host of other one-off goodies like a special attack that splits into three separate missiles or another that explodes with a very large affect. This was a great addition to the game and the sort of thing that I wish there had been more of. Sadly, you can only access the store right after you've beaten a boss, so by the time I got to play with this option I was usually pretty ticked off.  I managed to get quite a lot of play out of Missile Command, but most of my time was spent with the classic mode. While its obvious that Hasbro put a lot of work into this remake's look and feel (both of which are great), the ridiculous end bosses left me so frustrated that it became a real chore to work my way through the game. If you're a huge Missile Command fan, I recommend picking this title up just to get your chance to play a really good re-release on your PC. For those looking for a brand new play experience, your time and money may be better spent elsewhere.  -- Trent C. Ward", "date": "Jan 6, 2000"}
