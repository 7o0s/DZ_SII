Somewhere along the line woodblock prints of royalty evolved into oversized monsters with heavy artillery, but for the purpose of this review, the history of the genre may as well have started with Magic the Gathering. Whatever your point of reference, the latest evolution of the genre has arrived in the form of Duel Masters on the PS2. This is the most complete console version of a card battle game to date on the system. It includes all of the features that one would expect of a game in this genre, and a couple extras to boot. Unfortunately, there is one feature that is sorely missed, but we'll discuss that later.   So what exactly is Duel Masters? For experienced duelists, it is a monster battle card game based on the Magic the Gathering rule set. Like certain other card games, it has been a popular craze in Japan for years. There is also a Duel Masters cartoon, which of course prominently features the graphic excitement of strategically comparing cards with detailed statistics. The GBA was already graced with Duel Master's Sempai Legends earlier this year but this marks the first version of the game to appear on a console.   This is also the first pure card battle game on the PS2, barring Yu-Gi-Oh! Duelist of the Roses, which has a heavy chessboard, strategy element. In Duel Masters, there is no battlefield to navigate, or positioning of allies against enemies. This is a straight up card duel, where the quality of your deck and the luck of the draw are what determine the outcome. If none of this makes any sense because you are completely new to the card battle phenomenon, there is a detailed tutorial that can be accessed from the menu or at the beginning of story mode.   Click For More Images The main single player experience is a story mode that consists of a long chain of card battles separated by brief story elements. Gamers choose one of five main characters that are associated with one of the five colors and try to stop the Evil Widow. Stop the Evil Widow from what? Most likely some type of complete domination, attainment of ultimate power, or bathing the earth in the cleansing flames of destruction. Take your pick of bad intentions, the only thing that matters is that in order to set things right, one of the five characters is going to have to win the five colors tournament by besting their opponents in many, many card duels.   The story unfolds using animated cut scenes that fans will recognize from the cartoon. However, keep in mind that there are little to no RPG elements involved in this game. The story mode contains a map screen with a number of areas that can be accessed by winning duels and boosting a character's reputation. The map screen consists of locations around town where duelists and characters hang out. Selecting the school will give gamers a first person view of a classroom where they can speak to, and battle other duelists. Each win gains points towards a character's reputation and some new cards to add to the deck. The ~quests~ involve going to a location and speaking to a character in order to initiate a duel. There is little else to think of besides dueling and managing your ever-growing card collection.   Speaking of cards, a player's deck is automatically saved to the memory card every time an adjustment is made or a card is added. Cards can then be swapped with other players and loaded onto other systems for battles against friends. Ease of trading and deck mobility is both great additions to this game. This is also a good time to mention the deck-building interface. Managing cards is an aspect of any card collecting game that can become tedious and frustrating, luckily there are numerous ways to organize and filter cards. Cards are easily swapped out and replaced as your deck becomes more powerful.   Ever notice how in card battle cartoons the protagonist seems to always have an ace in the hole? Just before loosing, their most powerful card materializes at the top of the deck and turns the tide of the battle. Duel Masters gives gamers the chance to replicate this through the signature card system. A signature card can be assigned in deck management and becomes available at the crucial moment in battle when your monsters are on their last legs. Its effect on game play is minimal, but it's still an interesting result of the cartoons which so often supplement this type of game.   One frustrating aspect of card games on a console is that it is impossible to replicate the true multiplayer experience on one screen. In order for the game to stay exciting, opponents must be able to hide their playable cards. In normal mode, players can see each other's drawn cards as each player cycles through them. Duel Masters may not provide a solution to this problem, but they do introduce a way around the issue with extreme mode. This puts a time limit on all aspects of the card battles, forcing players to make split second decisions as to what monster to summon and what spells to cast. No more making a sandwich while deciding whether to cast a spell, or unleash the Nomad Hero Gigio. Manna slowly refills, while small clocks time players spells and the monster's sleeping sickness. Switching focus from the manna pool to monster's status will have get your heart rate going, and cause even the most experienced duelists to make judgmental errors while trying to multitask.    Duelists can also toggle this frantic style of game play as the default battle style for story mode. It definitely adds a level of excitement to battles, and can really test one's knowledge of their deck and the rules and it's a great way to up your game in anticipation of an actual card games against friends. Another side effect is that the overall length of a battle drops dramatically. And with time as the only limitation, a quick thinker (or knowledgeable duelist) has the opportunity to seriously outnumber their opponent by summoning more monsters.   Playing against blockers also becomes much more exciting. If your deck is seriously overpowered by a deck full of powerful blockers, it will only be a matter of time before you are stone walled into using every card; which by the way, forfeits the match. If you enjoy strategy but find the game play of card games to be a bit too slow, this is the only way to go. Personally, after testing out extreme mode, there was no going back to the turn based battles.   Enjoy summoning monsters but don't have the imagination to picture how they react in battle? Well you're in luck because every monster in Duel Masters has a battle, and death animation. The demented crews that go toe-to-toe in this game are even more over the top than creatures in rival games like Yu-Gi-Oh! They also make for some entertaining animations, at least the first couple times the monsters are set loose. After awhile, gamers will find themselves skipping most battle animations and then turning them off completely.   There are five battle arenas, one for each color, and they are also presented in 3D. Each stage acts as a backdrop for the card battle interface, which is easy to learn and provides all useful battle information at a glance or the click of a shoulder button. The importance of the interface becomes even more apparent in extreme mode, where fumbling can lead to a missed opportunity and ultimately the loss of the game.While Duel Masters has all of the qualities needed for a great card battle game, it is missing one thing that keeps it from being touted as a must have. Extreme mode is great, and the ability to store a deck and trade cards using a memory card is nice, but sadly gamers will have to keep waiting for card duels to go online. It seems a little silly that the original version of the card game can never be played against a real person. In fact for some purists this may be a compelling reason to just stick with the paper versions of these types of games. However, while the rule set has been tweaked a bit for the transition to the screen, this doesn't make the game any less fun. Also, the genre as a whole has yet to make the great leap online and the other multiplayer options almost, but not quite, make up for this shortcoming.For a game that is based around player rankings, tournaments and card trading, the day that duelist can go head to head online will indeed be glorious. Until that day, Duel Masters is the best that card battling has to offer on the PS2. The ability to trade cards, story mode, and multiplayer options are all welcome features along with the extreme mode, which is the real reason to own this game.As with all card battle games the argument remains: What makes the video game better than buying the actual deck. There are issues of price and convenience, collecting every paper card requires a heft investment of time and money. However, searching and trading for rare cards is half the fun of the system. With a game like Pokemon, there is an in depth role playing game which compliments the battle system, not to mention the wireless multiplayer capabilities of the latest version on the GBA. Because Duel Masters only consists of card battling, its more difficult to say that the digital version is superior, especially if you have a friend to battle against.", "date": "Nov 2, 2004"}
