With the success of Tony Hawk, skateboarding, BMX, snowboarding, surfing, and even wakeboarding games are and have been flooding the market.  The Transworld line of extreme sports games started with Transworld Surfing, a good if flawed game, and now Atari/Infogrames has just released Transworld Snowboarding.     There are three snowboarding games currently on Xbox (excluding this one) that cover a wide range of styles.  Amped leans toards the simulation side, SSX Tricky is flat-out arcade chaos, and Dark Summit is a story-based snowboarding game where you're out to save the world.  Does Transworld Snowboarding refine one of these styles or create a niche of its own?  How about neither.  GameplayTransworld Snowboarding feels a little like SSX and a lot of Amped.  You move the player with the left stick and pull different grabs with the right stick.  The direction, and also whether the stick is depressed, will result in different types of grabs.  One of the problems with this approach is that hitting the diagonals in just the right place can be difficult.  So when one of your goals is to pull off a 540 Stalefish (upper-left) Mctwist, it's very easy to accidentally pull off a Method (left) or a Nosegrab (up).  It's almost trial-and-error to get the move just right.  Some of the SSX flavor comes in the rails.  There are lots of them, and riding them is very similar.  To hop on a rail, you press B or Y before you land on it.  You can use the triggers to rotate in circles, and the left analog stick for balance.  Also like SSX is your adrenaline meter.  On the right side of the screen is a human heart that fills up as you complete tricks.  You can then press X for a speed boost, helpful in races and making long jumps.  Like Amped, Transworld Snowboarding takes a more realistic approach to the sport.  You can only pull off a couple moves while in the air, and the amount of air you can catch is, while not entirely realistic, a lot less than say SSX.  But some of the goals you are given are to get an incredibly high amount of points within the level, some of which only last literally 20 seconds.  To do this, you must combo your moves together.  By pressing the left and right triggers in succession, right before landing a trick, you will start a short timer that last rouhly 3-5 seconds.  Any move you do during this time will be tacked on to your previous tricks and the score accumulated.  You can literally combo your entire run as one long string of moves.  The catch is that you have to land straight in order to begin a combo.  This is easier said than done, especially when hitting odd slopes or trying to spin of rails.  A funny trick I found was that you can jump straight up and combo it.  This will result in you doing a quick 180, and will add a few points to your total.  By doing this over and over, you can extend the timer until you reach a ramp to jump off of.  Also, like the Tony Hawk games, if you are in the middle of a combo when the timer runs, you can continue doing tricks until your combo ends.  If you are shy a few points from a goal, you can continue combo-ing your jumps until the desired score is reached.  In theory you can do this to reach all the high scores.  It might just take you a long, long while. Burn baby burn! One of the more frustrating things in Amped was that it was very easy to fall.  Whether it was not landing perfectly straight, or hitting an obstacle, you found yourself constantly falling until you got a feel for the controls.  Transworld Snowboarding is exactly the opposite.  Unless you are landing directly on top of your head, you will not fall.  Still holding a grab when you land?  No problem.  Land sideways and at a 45 degree angle?  No worries.  Flying down a hill at 100 kph and hit a bus head-on?  Child's play.  It is simply hard to crash.  You could play through most of the game with only a handful of bails.  Younger or less experienced gamers may appreciate this, but it makes the game a little too easy.  With the goals themselves already not posing to much of a problem, the only real challenge is being able to combo enough tricks to reach the super pro score.       The game has four main modes of play: Transworld Tour, Single Session, Multiplayer, and Freeride.  The tour mode is what you'll probably being playing most of.  In this mode you choose one of ten real-life snowboarders and complete goals to open up locked levels and boards.  After choosing your rider and board, you begin at the first of sixteen different levels and try to complete the given goals.  The types of goals you are given are typically do this move, get this many points, grind this far, find this, and smash that.  Pretty typical stuff.  The levels where you must smash objects are a little boring and will have you slowly combing the tracks for the obstacles rather than pulling off tricks and cruising down a mountain.  The other goals also tend to grow old and stale after not too long.  All in all, the career mode is not nearly as deep as that of Amped, and also not as rewarding.Like Amped, each level has a goal where you have to make the cover of Transworld magazine.  To do this, you must pull off a trick worth so many points in front of a photographer.  A little camera icon shows on screen to let you know you are within range, but Amped's view-finder frame is much more effective.  Also, while more of a bug than a design issue, whether you complete the cover shot goal or not, at the end of the level it always shows you on the cover of the magazine.  To see if you really did complete the goal you have to look at your goals list.  Just terrible.While we're on the subject of weird bugs/design flaws, let's talk about another one: the ambiguity of some of the goals.  For example, one level's goal is to smash the steeple of a church.  After continuously smashing the steeple and hearing the confirmation sound (but not the text), the goals list continuously showed that the goal was not complete.  Thinking this was a bug, I continuously repeated the goal hoping one of them would register and I could move on.  Well, it turns out what they meant was (or just a result of  bad programming), smash the steeple of the church without touching the church.  Now how in the world was is anyone supposed to know that?Another oddity (bug?) is during the player selection screen.  While you don't have the ability to change their clothes, you can determine if they wear goggles or not.  That is, until you actually start the race.  Whether you decided to have the goggles on or off on the character selection screen, the rider will always be wearing them in the race.  With no create-a-rider mode (boo!), all hopes of customizing, if that's what you want to call it, your rider are now gone.  There are also some severe clipping and collision detection problems.  Never before has a snowboarder done a better impression of Kitty Pryde.  Through walls, cars, and trees, there is little that can stop your rider from defying the laws of physics and reality.     Level DesignThere are five varying classes of courses: Slopestyle, Halfpipe, Boarder Rally, Straight Jump, and Backcountry.  Slopestyle and Backcountry are similar, and are the bigger, wider levels where you can explore more while still pull off a good number of tricks.  These levels are decent, but are not as expansive as Amped's nor as interesting.  The Straight Jump levels are incredibly short.  Literally between 15-20 seconds, the levels will have you racing down a short steep hill pulling off as many tricks as you can, and then ending in a large quarter-pipe for one last air trick.  Too short to really enjoy, these levels feel tacked on and don?t even feel like real levels.  Also, three of the sixteen tracks are straight jumps so the number of levels is a little deceiving.  Amped had its share of short runs too, but there were many more locations, and each location had multiple trails you could select, resulting in many more levels.Boarder Rally levels are races that play similar to SSX, just without the trash-talking, fighting, or cool moves.  One of the levels even looks like it was ripped straight from Tricky.  To win these races, you cannot perform many tricks since catching air will actually slow you down.  So, what you'll find yourself doing is just racing down the track performing no tricks and actually avoiding jumps.  Woohoo!  There are also other goals like making a certain jump, but you can always just restart the track after you win the race.  Lastly, there are the halfpipe levels.  Just a long halfpipe rather than a mountain that has you performing the same type of goals found in the other levels.  Overall, the levels are just average.  They're not designed as well, or are as big as that of Amped.  The fact that there are only sixteen levels, with three being straight jumps makes the selection feel even thinner.  And lastly, you can blow through the first thirteen levels in one sitting.  The last three are a little tougher only because you have to get most of the super pro scores on the preceding levels.          Grab that rear end! Multi-playerWhat fun is an extreme sports game without multi-player.  Transworld Snowboarding offers two options for multi-player: split screen (horizontal or vertical) and super pro.  Split screen is divided into slope style and boarder rally races.  These are just like the single player races, except the person with higher score wins in slope style.  Super pro mode has up to four players taking turns seeing who can win the most runs, and we all know how fun waiting for another player is.Graphically, the levels maintain a decent amount of detail, though the framerate does take a hit even in two player.  Not too distracting, but added with floaty controls, things could get ugly.     These modes are decent fun, but could get old quickly.  The tracks are not full of cool shortcuts and since falling is so difficult, the balance is a little offset.  Unfortunately, those just buying the game wanting to play with some friends will have to wait until they unlock more levels since only one is available for slope style and none are immediately open in boarder rally mode.        GraphicsIf you don't really pay close attention, Transworld Snowboarding looks like a great game.  But upon close inspection, the flaws creep their way to the surface.  First off, the draw distance is quite far but there is some pop-up as well as draw-in.  It's not something you notice right away, but it is there.  It's especially noticeable on some of the level flyovers, where mountains seem to deform as the camera sweeps by.Also, some of the snow textures come off as extremely compressed.  The artifacts are readily apparent where the color is false, and the overall texture blocky.  In addition to that, on some of the levels, particularly the racing ones, the mip-mapping appears to have almost no filtering on it, producing a weird line effect.  The snow textures are not the only ones at fault.  Many of the object textures are blurry and flat.  One close look at the snow patrol or buildings and you'll think you were playing a PS1 game.  Not only are the textures awful, the actual geometry of some of the objects is of the simplest nature.  Again, just take a gander at the snow patrol.One of the cool ideas thrown in the game is to have the riders clothes flutter in the wind.  Unfortunately, this looks more like a graphical glitch than anything else.  The edges of the clothes are jagged and move with a stiffness that is anything but flowing.  On some of the riders it looks decent, but others just horrid.  Framerate is another issue.  It constantly fluctuates depending on the amount of detail on screen, from silky smooth to barely cutting it.  The worst times are when you can see a lot of the course ahead of you and you are kicking up lots of powder.  The framerate also makes some of the animations look jerkier than they already are.  I won't even talk about the animations at the end of the tracks. Transworld Snowboarding is not a terrible looking title.  Just one that's missing a lot of refinement and polish.  With some more time it could've looked great as there are some hints of nice stuff (the nighttime levels and colored lighting), but as is, it's little better than average. Aliens, mountains, and night. SoundLike Amped, Transworld Snowboarding didn't go for a small selection of popular licensed music, but opted rather for a large roster of lesser-known bands, though there are a few larger, mainly hip-hop, artists including Black Eyed Peas, Blackalicious, Bubba Sparxxx (what's with all the b's?!?), and one of my personal favorites, Dilated Peoples.  The only other band I was a really a fan of previously is Quarashi, known to many as the Icelandic Beastie Boys.  There should be a little bit for everyone on here, from Aphex Theory to Hoobastank to Riddlin Kids (go Austin!), but if not, you can always create your own soundtrack with your ripped cds, though it only works on the levels themselves and not the menu screens.The sound effects in the game are pretty standard.  You've got the crowd cheering, the sound of the snow under your board, and the grind of your board on rails.  Nothing special here.  Though the game supports Dolby Digital, you probably won't notice the difference from a stereo connection.  Another strange quirk in the game is that if you turn off the game music in the options, all sound from any of the FMV sequences is lost, music and voice.  I don?t even see how these are related.  So, if you unlock a rider's video (which aren't that interesting in the first place) and are one of those people who turns off the game music, be sure to turn it back on to actually hear the video.  Strange and annoying.            My price => 5 dollas!Transworld Snowboarding is full of too many flaws and bugs to be considered a worthy purchase.  The game just has an overall unfinished feel.  Add that to the ease of the game, limited tracks, and limited multi-player and the value decreases further.  If you need a snowboarding game for Xbox, get Amped or SSX Tricky, depending on the style of game you are looking for.  Both are more fun and worth their money, especially Amped, which you can find at some store for only 20 bucks.  If you already have both and are dying to play something new, Transworld Snowboarding would make a good weekend rental.  You'll have enough time to play through most of it, and you won't spend 50 dollars.  Some players will like this game a lot, but I recommend you rent it first to see if it's your cup of tea.", "date": "Oct 25, 2002"}
