The veritable slew of games which focus on this era seems to be growing with every passing day and while this growth is a great thing if you are a fan of the genre, it also makes the competition tough for those trying to compete with the many titles already out there.This is the precarious position the Bitmap Brothers find themselves in with their latest RTS, WWII: Frontline Command. If you have played their previous RTS Steel Soldiers, the long awaited second game in the Z series, you will notice a few similarities in Frontline Command's engine and the interface. That said, The Bitmaps have crafted a new game which takes into account the terrible mortality rate which was a part of the fighting during WWII. It's very hard to keep a large number of your troops alive for many of the missions. Sometimes, after getting sent through the meat grinder, you'll just have a handful of infantry left to get the job done.After the game loads the show is kicked off with intro footage so familiar we might have seen it a thousand times before in similar games. Even though you'll only watch it once, it's still annoying that not much of an attempt was made to fight past the  clichs.The tutorial mode is decent and takes you through moving, firing, camera control and using vehicles. It is all bog standard stuff and any RTS fan will find it isn't that necessary to go through. Those new to the genre will undoubtedly find it helpful however.There are recruit and veteran paths you can take although both modes, which seem to have a lot of missions in common, so it is hard to discern a difference. There seem to be more enemies lurking about in veteran missions and some of the missions not found in the rookie path are tougher than a GIs old army boots.  Success often requires the exercising of stealth and bravado in equal measure. Boldly rushing in isn't always the best way forward, but sometimes gradually seeding troops in an area can see them isolated and annihilated too. You must use your judgement and determine if the enemy force can be quickly overwhelmed by a good mass attack, or if more subtle means are the way to go.Line of sight can often be a very significant factor and the game challenges you to use the terrain as best as you can. You'll have to hide behind obstacles and set up killing zones which depend on the enemy being blind sided as they enter an area. You will also find that some units naturally have a longer vision range than others. Strategically using them at the head of your advance can be a very wise tactic, especially when you have mortars and supporting artillery. The use of LOS as a part of the game design is welcome.Enemy troops will not only take the initiative to take out your forces when they see them, but will also react to you if you're attacking their allies directly or indirectly. This is a great thing as it means you can no longer simply isolate and destroy enemy forces in small pockets while able reinforcements are standing dumbly nearby.However there are still some odd and disappointing moments. Like the time my valiant but misguided infantry squad decided they liked the sound of their pathetic rifle bullets bouncing off the hull of a German tank. They seemed to like less the sound of high calibre machine guns and shellfire from the tank ripping them to shreds. This sort of inconsistent and poorly thought out AI is something you'd like to see exorcised from the genre. Having infantry that are nearly totally ineffective scatter before tanks and choose better targets intelligently would be nice.Your units have to also be careful how much noise they make as gunfire can attract enemy attention. Enemy AI may not be able to pinpoint your forces, but they will still seem to react if you're a clumsy mumsy as you enter the area with guns a blazin' or running around through the trees peeing all over and screaming like a fat schoolchild running after the ice cream truck. For example, troops crawling often are a better option than running  as they make a lot less sound, as well as being harder to see. A helpful icon appears above a unit when it is within earshot, although you often find out too late after you have been discovered that you are making noise. Some sort of sound cone warning system, perhaps like that used in Commandos, might have been helpful.    The game also has a decent morale system which makes it less likely you are going to have much success if you send in suicide squads to take out the enemy. Morale can dive after losses and once the trend emerges it can be hard to get your troops over their worries. That said if you do well, your men will become more capable of heroic actions and this is really satisfying. Seeing your heroic troops single handed taking on enemy tanks or fortifications is fun times.Frontline Command has a number of basic and useful AI states, options like 'defend', 'ambush' and so on and these help you to co-ordinate large numbers of men preventing them from taking the initiative too early and spoiling your grand plan. In this sense, the game will appeal to you if you have a more patient nature. Success if all about occupying the most useful territory with the most appropriate unit and then bringing maximum firepower to bear on an enemy force, which isn't as equally equipped to fire in kind.As would be expected from a game of this ilk, different formations are available, and most units have alternate weapons which can be fun to experiment with. These are selected quite easily during the heat of battle although the key to success is knowing what to use and which weapons to conserve.The landscape delivers mixed blessings. On the good side of the equation the various buildings you come across look good, can be garrisoned by troops, and can be destroyed with some rather satisfying explosions. However some of the smallest obstacles seem illogically able to block even the path of a heavy tank. Your soldiers must be an arthritic lot as gates, walls, and other similar structures can't be leapt over, even though this would be a cinch in real life.Similarly, tanks can't just rumble over dilapidated looking wooden fences! This is craziness. It forces you to move about the map and into bottlenecks and traps, just because one of the programmers behind the game decided to create the 'Super FenceTM - impervious to all that man can throw at it'. It's just not realistic.  The visuals may be a little drab with a lot of grey, khaki, black and brown and this might not be the most exciting assortment of colours, but it is true to the period so you can't really complain too much about it. The explosions are also rather spiffy with a few decent particle effects and some nice animations.At the centre of the game design is the idea that you must successfully manage your limited resources while overcoming an enemy who is often skilfully entrenched and more often than not skilfully entrenched with superior numbers. You can't follow the easy road taken in so many RTS games. You can't build a base and churn out and endless supply of troops here. So you had better husband the resources you have well. Frontline Command is unlikely to please Generals fans, but it is a deep and well thought out game which throws you into the hell that was WWII. Youll need to be patient to get into this game (even in multiplayer) but the perseverance is worth it as the interface, mechanics and AI combine for what is, for the most part, a decent strategy title. S ure there are a few minor AI glitches and the presentation is hardly going to leap off the screen, but if you have khaki running through your veins you wont give a damn.", "date": "Aug 29, 2003"}
