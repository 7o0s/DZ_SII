{"name": "Sim Theme Park", "name_review": "Sim Theme Park", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/03/29/sim-theme-park", "text": "Now I know the sentence above may have led you to believe that this game might suck, but there's a different reason for making people puke their brains out other than a crappy game: roller coasters. Sim Theme Park enables you to ease the most sadistically creative brain cells into the driver's (or is that builder's?) seat and lets them tear loose, crafting guaranteed upchuckers galore through a plethora of inventive themed parks. And the best part? Once you've crafted your girder-and-pylon masterpiece, be it Michelangelan or Daliesque, you can take it for a spin. That's right, do well enough building your park, and you can hop into it as a guest, trying out all of the features and rides you've built. It's a blast and begs the question, ~Why hasn't this been done yet?~   There's no doubt about it, with a little time (and hopefully a quiet room), Sim Theme Park can be one of the best wastes of time you get for under $50. The fantastic interface combined with an amazing number of options ensures that even on the most basic level, you're going to be having a boatload of fun. The sheer amount of depth found within this game all but assures that you'll have a completely different park every time, even when they're in the same locales.   Gameplay Sim Theme Park is the perfect example of depth hidden under the guise of a simple premise. What could be more simple than building a couple of rides, food stands, games, and charging $100 a head to get in, right? And that's what's so intoxicating about STP's gameplay. It's at once simple and complex, enabling you move from intricate micro-management to merely watching the on-screen action without it ever seeming like you're investing too much or too little effort.   Sim Theme Park features an ever-changing menu that will shift chameleon-like to whatever you need to have accomplished. In other words, if you're near an existing path, the shape buttons will shift to accommodate path additions, deletions, or tacked-on assemblies. Likewise, the menus will shift to cover the operations of building an object (ride, attraction, feature, etc.) whenever you move to an open area. The only real downside to the interface is that there's no real cursor, so you have to guesstimate where on the screen the menu is reflecting. In some of the more open spaces, this can lead to a cumbersome and unnecessary game of ~find the menu target.~   As in any good sim, the depth of play is available right at the start of play, but isn't forced upon you. The game's laptop is the perfect example of this, offering access to any part of your park's managements. Everything from entrance ticket price to the emotions of leaving customers is available for your perusal, and when you're doing about 20 things at once, it's often a lifesaver to be able to check out your parks various needs on the fly. There's literally so much depth that trying to explain all the areas would probably be as fun as having your butt hairs tweezed out, but trust me, this game's a blast.   Rides, are of course, the central part of any theme park, and Sim Theme Park not only lets you craft the world's most insane roller coasters, it lets you actually ride  them. That's right, simply earn enough golden tickets (which are awarded for various accomplishments, whether it be keeping the park open for a set number of years, or just having your park look nice), and you can buy a camcorder that drops you down in the park in an interesting first-person view.   Graphics Sim Theme Parks visuals are fantastic  from the overhead view. While you're building and maintaining your park, you view it at an 80-degree overhead angle, and the detail is great. What you see on-screen is a combo of 3D landscapes and objects with a 2D border and visitors. The sprites for the people don't look all that varied  at first. As I said before, if you manage to snag a camcorder, you'll get the opportunity to peer at your machinations through a park goers' eyes. Once you're in the first-person view, you can pat yourself on the back; you've just earned yourself a ticket to pixelville, population: you.   Two-dimensional sprites where crafted long ago when 3D objects were too taxing on current hardware to ever be feasible. They're simply 2D objects that may or may not be animated, and when they're plopped into a 3D world, they just don't fit. One of the major downfalls of the sprite is that they can never increase in detail as you get closer, so when you're a few digital inches from them, you're met with a moving mass of pixeled horror. Most of the time, it looks something like The Blob eating a LEGO factory, and it's not pretty to look at.   While the concept itself for hopping into your park is a novel one, the final execution is a little lacking. Detail is largely nonexistent, thanks to the graphic muscle needed to actually display your rides, close-up sprites, and the sky all at once. The sky itself is simply a shaded mass of white-on-blue, and really looks rather ugly. If this mode had been somehow hidden, that would be different, but it's something that most players will strive for, and it's essentially a flop.   Sound Sim Theme Park's sound is fantastic. The voice acting of your tutor is perfect; a calm, paced teacher that lays it out for you at the start, and then provides perfect feedback on how you're doing. Phrases like ~You're doing great, keep up the good work!~ and ~Psst, your visitors think your ticket prices are a steal! Maybe your should consider raising them.~ Are as constructive as they are guiltily boosting to the ego.   The music is also perfectly done. It's a very laid-back, unobtrusive mix of soft beats and ambient melodies. Some of it, like the first level's prehistoric theme are gorgeous aural treats, blending a soft, yet lumbering tuba with a slight calypso icing.   Effects, are as they should be, appropriate, but not over the top. They're simple clicks and swishes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, if you're lucky, you'll be able to hear your visitors' reactions to the environments. Should a guest have a bad burger, you may be treated to a nice groan, or on a particularly thrilling ride, you may hear kids screaming in glee. Unfortunately, I didn't pick up on any hideous barfing sounds, so if you want to hear the splash-on-pavement reward of your handiwork, you'll just have to make them yourself. Sim Theme Park is a fantastic game, if a little flawed in execution. The depth of play is a veritable smorgasbord of detail for all you control freaks out there. If you can sidestep the slightly marred graphic presentation in the 2D view, you will find what boils down to one of the best ways to kill a couple of hours without you even knowing about it.", "date": "Mar 29, 2000"}
