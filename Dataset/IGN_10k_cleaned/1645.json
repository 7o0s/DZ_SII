These games have been a staple of console systems since Nintendo's Super Mario Kart lit the green light, but for some strange reason, the Game Boy Color hasn't seen its share. Developers are finally catching up at the end of the life-cycle -- and by this time next year, we'll be swimming in Mario Kart clones on the Game Boy Advance.But even then, those Mode 7 racers will all look sort of the same, and might all play the same as well. Now is the opening for Game Boy Color designers to try some new tricks and perfect old standards on the Game Boy Color before it all becomes too easy on the new hardware. Woody doesn't go for the new tricks, but it finally perfects the Kart racing gameplay on the Game Boy Color. It's about time! Features:Trade ghost lap records with other Game Boy playersLinked two-player racingBattery back-up save keeps times and trophies for three playersOnly for Game Boy ColorAs absurd as it seems, the almost inconsequential Woody Woodpecker Racing (based on Walter Lantz classic hyperactive cartoon character, all but forgotten with the Pokmon-addicted digi-kids) is the best kart racer on the Game Boy Color. It's slow, but steady, and it wins the race with a trunk loaded with extras.Fueled up by Konami internal development studios, the production values of this game are above and beyond the call of duty in the quick-to-move Christmas season. There's a battery back-up to save a player's stats instead of the traditional hassle password, and it keeps those stats over three players in the quasi-quest mode. Each player will have to battle through the game's increasingly difficult and interesting stages to unlock  all of the characters and extra car parts. The game also stores three Ghost laps for players to challenge themselves if they find the computer too simple. These Ghost laps can be traded to other Woody racers so they can see just how good you are before you link up and play against each other in the game's multiple tracks. And those power-ups and hidden weapons you've unlocked? They'll come in handy in the Link play as well, since each player's individual progress is available to use against the other racer. They may have unlocked more of the faster racers, but you might have unlocked better car parts for the standard racer, so who has the advantage is up in the air (unless you're racing a newbie, of course. Then, they're toast.) This is the kind of integrated bonus material and polished features that usually only come out in first-party Nintendo games, and it's incredible to see that quality here.And that sharp detailing stretched down into the graphics as well. The car models and big head figures are absolutely forgettable and unrecognizable -- a real heartbreaker when one of the badly-drawn characters is Chilly Willy. That much of the game needed much improvement, but since most of these characters wouldn't be familiar to most kids anyway, it's not a grand loss, and to compensate for the shoddy racers, there is an inset window at the bottom of the player's screen showing an animated close-up of your racer gritting his teeth from a hit or throwing back a good laugh as you blow pass the leader.The track visuals, on the other hand, are sharp and varied, with subtle coloring and lots of variety. There aren't any effects (although, back to the cars really quick, the Ghost lap shows a nice transparency effect on the ghosted racer), but the main goal was clean, clear visuals that go somewhere in a lap. You'll see a golf course with pins and sand traps, train tracks in the Wild West Ghost Town, and even a full pirate ship in the icy stage (which, of course, has a ramp up to race on its bridge). And while the tracks are mostly flat-colored, the surface detail (when it is there) is sharp and actually interactive -- little pixels of gravel make the racer bump and slow down slightly. There are also nice touches for the comic effect -- racers drop with a whistle when they slide off the track, and some stages have dogs on the sidelines, fish jumping in the pond, and other details along the track. Halloween Town has hanging pumpkin lanterns, and one stage even has polar bears pointing the way.Nice graphics are great, but racing games live and die by their control. Woody Woodpecker Racing drives very smoothly, but may be too slow for most race fans. It's a leisurely game unfortunately, and even fully powered, cars don't move as fast as they might in something like R.C. Pro Am. Still, the game's challenge is fair and strong, always pushing gamers but never unfairly like in the PlayStation version, and the racing fun is there still in the slower pace.If you can get used to the low speed, the game's controls reward.  Driving is smooth and precise, with a nice power-sliding engine and smart placement of Zipper Plates and other track elements to encourage smart driving. Enemy AI isn't brilliant -- the computer will make mistakes it should have seen -- but in some cases, it's smart enough to pose a good challenge. For instance, when enemies get Invincibility potions, they will intentionally steer to wipe out other racers. As far as the weapon selection, it's not brilliant or different from Mario, and only a few attacks really do much damage, but some are handled cleverly even though they're generic attacks. The best is the Missile, which seeks out the leader and hammers him. If you're battling for the lead and launch a Missile, best be careful not to pass your opponent, or the Missile will tag you instead!Outside of the speed, the only complaints I'd have are that the engine sometimes slows down -- otherwise, it runs silky-smooth with lots of frames of animation for the racers, so even though it's not so fast, it still races technically. Rarely does the slowdown kill you in play, but when it happens, it's pretty severe and slows the game to a crawl for a second. Also, Konami of America should have double-checked this game before getting it to market -- the text is plagued with little funny Japanglish phrases like ~The grade has become 4~ and  ~Aim at full victory!~ When one of the racers is unlocked, he exclaims that it's about time he's gotten his fair shot at the title, but crunched into Japanglish, the text became, ~It's about time I got shot!~While Konami's PlayStation versions of Universal Interactive games have been universally disappointing, the Game Boy games have been an entirely different surprise. The Grinch was chosen as one of our Editor's Choice titles, and from our brief play of The Mummy, the game is an old-school but promising platformer. And now Woody Woodpecker Racing is the best surprise in any kart racer on the Game Boy Color. All developed by Konami's great Japanese production staff, the quality of these games bodes greatly for Konami and Universal's other upcoming games -- Jurassic Park III, The Thing, and the incredible PlayStation expatriate and Crash Bandicoot on the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance. We weren't sure what to expect from these games at first, especially since the Universal / Konami deal and titles came so fast and furious, but with trademark Konami quality shown in Woody Woodpecker Racing, there's no need to fear. Nice lap, Konami.  Keep up that pace and you'll smoke 'em out there.", "date": "Dec 15, 2000"}
