Gundam: The Battle Master wasn't exactly Street Fighter III, but it's got decent 2D fighter gameplay for an anime-licensed game, and Battle Assault, the new American version of that slightly aged import, features a well-done blend of Wing mechs for the kids and Universal Century for folks with taste.  Gundam: The Battle Master, if you missed it (which you probably did) was a 2D fighter with Gundam mechs, descended from the bizarrely amusing Gundam Wing: Endless Duel on the Super Famicom.  It had simple, straightforward combat, cool special attacks, towering bosses, and remarkably good animation thanks to a simple graphical shortcut - the mechs were rendered in chunks with easy-to-manipulate individual polygons, rather than as one big sprite like a Street Fighter character that required the storage of many animation frames.  Battle Master spawned a sequel, with new mechs but the same formula, and now America gets Battle Assault, essentially the same game as Battle Master 2, to take advantage of Gundam Wing's popularity over here.  Fanboy Stuff The mech selection is still heavily weighted towards the UC, though, thankfully preventing me from doubling over with nausea while playing the game.  Not counting unlockable mechs and bosses - the Big Zam, Neue Ziel, Hydra and Psycho Gundam, among others - the selectable crew (listed Mech - Pilot) is as follows:  Wing Gundam - Weaksauce Bishonen Hosehead Zeong - Old-School Char Aznable (MS Gundam) Sazabi - New-School Char Aznable (Char's Counterattack) Quin Mantha - Ple Two ZZ Gundam - Judau Ashta Hygog - Mikhail Kaminsky The-O - Paptimus Scirocco GP-02A - Anavel Mutha*&%$#! Gato Acguy - Akahana Qubeley - Haman Karn Z Gundam - Kamiru Bidan  This is a fine selection of mechs, and it'd be downright perfect if it weren't for one of the peculiarities of the story mode (the game includes a two-player versus mode and a single-player story mode).  The story mode contains one lead character: Heero Yuy.  You can drive any mech you want, but the character inside must always be the miserable whinging punk from Wing.  Turning on the game, I was torn - I wanted to pilot the unspeakable glory of the MSN-04 Sazabi, but I didn't want that miserable little thug sliming up the cockpit.  Gameplay I picked the Sazabi anyway, of course.  It's displayed in all its Red Comet glory, while Heero is just a little portrait in the corner of the screen.  That objection to the game's presentation aside, it's still a lot of fun to play if you're a fan of Gundam - the realization of the mech designs is lovely, and there are plenty of impressive special attacks to pull off.  You can fly around the screen with the R1+R2 thruster maneuver, thanks to the tall Versus-style arenas, avoid combinations with KOF-inspired sidestep moves, and ammunition limitations throw a bit of a kink into some of the weapon-based special attacks.  The story mode features multiple mid-game and end bosses, some of which stretch two and three times taller than the standard Mobile Suits, forcing the camera to pull back as far as it can go through the entire battle.  Altogether, Battle Assault plays rather like a slowed-down X-Men vs. Street Fighter (these are giant robots, after all), complete with insanely cheap final opponents.  Who's worse: Magneto or the Hydra Gundam?  The world may never know.  Graphics  Like I said, Battle Assault draws its 2D mechs out of individual chunks, rather than one big sprite.  The result is a game that doesn't move quite so smoothly as most 2D fighters (this technique wouldn't work for representing humans), but the sprites are much bigger and more detailed than they could have been.  Taller mechs like the Sazabi and the The-O fill two-thirds of the screen, and the largest bosses are extremely impressive.  Fans should certainly be pleased by the quality of their replication in the game.  Slowdown isn't much of a problem, either.  Even when the background goes all starry and you bust loose with the Sazabi's Beam Shot Flush or the ZZ's Hyper Mega Particle Cannon (whee!), everything moves just fine.  The overall pace of the game is quite slow, and beginners will definitely get a little mashy at times, but it's still perfectly playable.  Sound  For an anime-licensed game, Battle Assault is surprisingly light on spoken dialogue.  It's missing some other typical trappings of the genre, like an animated intro, although perhaps I should be somewhat thankful on that score, since I'm spared the potential horror of hearing Two-Mix deliver the opening theme.  The soundtrack is blissfully free of such rot, although it's unfortunately also devoid of anything really inspiring.  The effects work well, though, suitably conveying the impression of crashing MS metal.This isn't a game for serious fighter fans, but it's definitely one for Gundam fans, Wing or otherwise.  Indeed, it might help remind the Toonami crowd that ~Gundam~ doesn't necessarily denote ~angst-ridden prettyboy.~  The action is solid enough to let the license carry it a little further, which is a step up from the typical anime standard of ~create excrable game, let license carry it to somewhere around 'well below average.'~  There's stuff to unlock in the one-player mode, and the bosses present an amusing challenge (they're unstoppable until you figure out the key to their patterns, at which point they become pushovers) while it'd be a great two-player or convention game among fellow fanboys.Now I need to find someone else to play with, so I can get the proper fellow piloting my Sazabi...", "date": "Nov 21, 2000"}
