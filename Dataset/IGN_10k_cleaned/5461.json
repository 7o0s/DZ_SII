The Movie: 3D Game", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/02/03/swat-the-movie-3d-game", "text": "Mix high-end cellphones with 3D graphics chips and high-speed 3G networks and you have the ability to create some pretty amazing to-go gaming. So what does Sony Pictures Mobile do with all that new tech under the hood? They make a licensed whack-a-mole game based on the 2003 summer popcorn flick, ~S.W.A.T.~ Kind of an auspicious start, don't you think?   You are Street, a new S.W.A.T. cop under the tutelage of Hondo, the grizzled department veteran. You are tasked with transporting an international criminal through Los Angeles. The catch -- and there always is one -- is that the criminal has announced a $100 million dollar reward for anybody who frees him from police custody. This brings out every crook in LA, and wouldn;t you know it, they all have matching camouflage outfits.   Imagine SEGA's Virtua Cop, but without the light gun accessory. Now, divide the screen into a three-by-three grid. When a bad guy appears in that section of the screen, press the corresponding number key to shoot him. Some bad guys take more shots than others, and you must always take care not to shoot innocents -- no matter how annoyingly close to the bad guys they get. And then do this over and over and over again for an hour.   To say S.W.A.T. The Movie: 3D Game gets boring is an understatement. An on-rails shooter with 3D graphics is actually a great idea, but this game is too slow-paced and monotonous for its own good. Couple that with errors (some minor, some glaring) and it's impossible for us to recommend it for download. For example, during a gunfight, a bad guy stood up into full view from the bottom of the screen. Okay. His body occupies the ~8~ section, but his head occupies the ~5~ area. We pressed ~8~ a few times, but even though these are body shots, it wasn't until we pressed ~5~ that we took the guy down.   There are five scenes, including a training mission. The scenes unfold in different locations, such as a rooftop, city street, and subway station. The camera tracks through the location, pauses when it's time to shoot, and then moves again when you've killed all of the bad guys. While moving, press either ~*~ or the left action key to reload your weapon. Reloading is a slow process, so make sure all of the bad guys are on the ground before starting to reload your weapon. At least the actual shooting is quicker and more responsive.   Visually, S.W.A.T The Movie: 3D Game is a mixed bag. Between scenes, Hondo will give you the 411 on your next mission. His model is very well done. The locations themselves are also nicely modeled and even though the scrolling is slow, it's very smooth. Unfortunately, the bad guy models are way too same-y, and when they slump forward after a kill shot, they break apart, revealing their broken polygon structure. The gun shot noises in S.W.A.T The Movie: 3D Game are not terribly thunderous, but they work. The in-game music is good, though, and unless you are in a crowded space, you won't be thumbing through the options screen to turn it off.   Because the individual missions are large, S.W.A.T. The Movie: 3D Game actually downloads each new chapter as soon as you can access it. This takes several seconds, but it's no worse than a PSone loading time.As excited as I am about V CAST, that intensity doesn't transfer to S.W.A.T The Movie: 3D Game at all. The game is slow and plodding, and the shooting action is entirely too simple. Pressing corresponding number keys is hardly the next gen of cellphone gaming that 3G was supposed to usher in, but if you're looking for a pretty good tech demo to show off your new handset's capabilities, S.W.A.T The Movie: 3D Game is an acceptable choice. Just understand, though, that there are certainly better games out there far more deserving of your money. After all, you're already paying an extra $15 a month for the privilege of V CAST -- if you're going to spend a few bucks more, make it count.", "date": "Feb 3, 2005"}
