The genre saw a number of popular additions during the previous generation of hardware. These included Turbo Prop Racing, Wave Runner, Wave Race 64 and the ever popular Hydro Thunder. Recently it seemed as if the watercraft racing craze had died down, however developer Argonaut has entered the mix with its recent release entitled Carve. Carve bares resemblance to these older water racers in a number of ways, mostly in the sense that it feels as if it was developed about 5 years ago.    Features   Xbox Live racing for up to 8 players, including co-operative team mode Five tournaments in the single player mode Ability to unlock faster watercraft, cheats, extra tricks and levels Split screen racing for up to 4 players Vast inventory of ramp and on the water tricks 5.1 Dolby Digital sound and 480p widescreen support    Gameplay  At its core, Carve is a racing game. The craft that crosses the finish line first after a set number of laps wins the race. At the start menu there are a number of modes available including quick race, arcade, tournament, trick tutorial, system link and Xbox Live. Quick race is pretty much self explanatory. It selects a player and a course at random and throws you into a race. Arcade mode offers the offline multiplayer function and supports up to four players on a single screen. The main single player experience is found in tournament mode. There are five tournaments which are of increasing difficulty and each tourney consists of four races. You must place at least 4th in each race in order to advance to the next course and eventually complete the tournament. There are only 2 courses available at the start of the game but a total of 27 courses can be unlocked by successfully completing the tournaments. The process of unlocking all of the games features can be completed in several hours.      There are four teams to choose from, each with their own team dynamics in the areas of tricks, speed, blocking, and teamwork. Pulling off tricks causes speed boosts, blocking refers to a loss of speed when one watercraft is caught in the wake of another, and teammates will block competitors during the race. Variations of these components from team to team have only the slightest bearing on the game. It makes sense to simply pick the team with the best average of speed and tricks. Your teammate's contribution to the race is hardly noticeable and while other racers will block your advancement, it is too difficult to purposely do the same to them.   The controls of Carve are fairly simple. The right trigger accelerates your craft while the left thumbstick steers. The course is marked with red and yellow buoys which have to be passed on the right and left respectively. Each race also has a time limit. The penalty for a buoy miss is a time deduction and each race affords you 5 misses. Buoys can be strategically missed to cut the course, but if more than 4 are missed or you run out of time you are disqualified. This is an interesting addition to the race, however it is fairly easy to stay within the course boundaries and after playing the game for more than an hour, disqualification rarely happens.    Steering the craft is responsive with an appropriate amount of drift considering the vehicles. It is possible to be knocked off your craft through a head on collision or a bungled trick. This will bring the craft to a stop as your character climbs back aboard, but it is easy enough to avoid these mishaps. The enemy A.I. offers relatively little competition until the last levels of the game. Racers will swerve to block your advancement and pull off speed boosting tricks of their own but a straightforward racing technique will quickly put them to shame.          A major aspect of winning races is pulling off tricks to gain ~rush.~ Rush is a speed boost that occurs after a successful trick. There are five levels to this boost which can be attained by linking tricks together. The higher the level, the longer the speed boost will last. Each consecutive rush also adds to a double rush meter that once filled can be activated by the left trigger. This results in a longer faster speed burst. Every character shares the same 12 water and ramp tricks plus two personal unlockable tricks. Tricks are mapped to the four main face buttons and involve button combos such as XYXY in the water or XX while going off a ramp. Flips and barrel rolls are completed by going over a ramp and holding the thumbstick in a direction then quickly pulling it in the opposite direction immediately after taking to the air. After completing the trick tutorial, pulling off combos is rather easy. The major problem with the trick system is that there are only 12 different moves shared by every character. You will quickly settle into a few of the easiest button combinations and repeat these tricks over and over again.     The Xbox Live mode of the game offers an arcade mode and a teamplay mode. Arcade is the same as the offline arcade mode and supports up to eight players online. Teamplay mode allows players to pair up two racers and enter a race with combined points and buoy misses. These variables add another dimension to the online mode but they are not too different from the straight-up arcade experience. Carve also features online rankings, headset support, and dedicated chat rooms. Online play had a steady frame rate, without any noticeable lag. With no technical downfalls to the Live experience it greatly adds to the value of the game.    Graphics  Most importantly Carve sports some nice looking water. There are realistic reflections and ripples. In the trick tutorial level the surface of the water is covered in an oily sheen. The wave physics are decent, however a large percentage of the tracks have still water so this is not much of a factor while racing. Each craft shoots up a spray that covers the camera in water particles in a nifty effect also seen in the racing game Quantum Redshift. The character models are smooth and animated well enough but each of them has a stereotypical personality and fashion sense. For example team inferno features 2 German riders with ~nasty tempers,~ blond hair, and wire rimmed glasses. The water crafts themselves are about as boring as could be imagined and the racing environments are nothing to get excited about.      Sound  Carve's music consists of a number of licensed tracks from electronic artists. These tracks are decent background music, however they quickly become repetitive. Any racing game on Xbox should include the custom sound track feature and it is sadly not included here. The sound effects from the water craft and surrounding environment can be described as adequate. The machines have a buzzing engine effect and the characters will shout out exclamations as they blast through the water. Throughout a race your teammate will appear in the upper right hand corner of the screen from time to time to offer advice. The voice acting is pretty bad, the dialogue is worse, and after the same line is repeated for the 10th time during a race this feature is downright annoying.    On the whole Carve offers an average gaming experience. If you are a fan of the genre you have probably played similar games that are far better. However, considering Carve hit the shelves at about 20 dollars and features full Live support, it may satisfy your needs if you are desperate for a watercraft racing game.", "date": "Mar 4, 2004"}
