{"name": "Scrabble Blast", "name_review": "Scrabble Blast", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/04/04/scrabble-blast", "text": "It's hard to imagine a successful variation on a perfect game like Scrabble, but EA Mobile gives it the ol' college try with Scrabble Blast. Offering three different game modes, Scrabble Blast attempts to mix up the classic wordie game with Tetris. The results work, but there is currently a better version of this style of game already on the decks: WordKing Spelltris by Digital Chocolate.   Scrabble Blast's puzzle mode dumps a grid of letter on to the screen and challenges you with creating words to fill up a level meter. Bigger words fill the meter faster, naturally. As you progress, clocks will appear over tiles to indicate the letter must be used within a certain amount of time. The Action game opts to make the clock power-ups mobile. Rather than sticking to a specific letter, they remain on a particular tile area, so the letter behind it changes as you create words around it, causing new letters to cascade into the screen. One Bag is a little more simple than the previous two modes. The game selects 100 letter tiles and challenges you to use them all to earn big points.   Scrabble Blast retains the point multipliers of the board game, with certain letters worth more points than others. The dictionary seems to be rather large, as I never had a problem with a rejected word during my test drive. The game screen is very clear, but I wish the game was given a little more personality. As I look at the casual space on PCs, I really think mobile could learn a thing or two about making games look more than just clean -- they need to look inviting.  Scrabble Blast isn't a bad game by any stretch. I enjoyed myself while playing, but couldn't stop thinking about how I liked Spelltris better. The multipliers for harder letters is a good wrinkle, though, and I doubt a single Scrabble fan would be displeased by this game.", "date": "Apr 4, 2006"}
