DIC's robotic detective has finally arrived for the GBC and this is one investigation you won't want to miss! Even if you're not familiar with the Inspector Gadget cartoons or the recent live-action movie starring Mathew Broderick as the bionic bumbler, Ubi Soft and developer RFX Interactive have packed in enough challenging platform action to make this game worth your while. Once a mild-mannered sleuth, Inspector Gadget gained is various mechanical enhancements (according to the cartoon) after being struck down by a tragic banana-peel accident. Gadget has vowed to stop Dr. Claw and his evil forces of the Malevolent Agency of Destruction (M.A.D.), but the dim-witted detective will need all the help he can get from his niece Penny and her dog Brain. Inspector Gadget is a terrific platformer with tons of gameplay variety and just enough difficulty  to make it worthwhile for experienced gamers who might otherwise pass over this gem.   Features: 15 levels Swap freely between Inspector Gadget, Penny, and Brain Use Inspector Gadget's many gadgets: hammer, helicopter, plunger arrows,  net launcher, photo flash and more Computer debugging mini-games Password saves Only for Game Boy Color  Customers of the Happykactus cactus supply company are disappearing and  M.A.D. is behind it! Inspector Gadget is air-lifted onto Awoo-Iwoo, the  secret island where Dr. Claw and his goons are hidden deep within their  volcano lair. Using an array of weapons that range from his helicopter hat to an enemy-stunning camera flash, Gadget must run, jump, and fight his way past M.A.D. henchmen and all kinds of deadly traps. Along the way players collect energy muffins, Gadget points, ammo for your weapons, and extra lives. But Gadget's niece Penny and her dog Brain are hot on Gadget's trail, ready to help at every turn. At any time, players can switch between Gadget, Penny and Brain, using their unique abilities to defeat the overwhelming forces assembled to stop them. Gadget has the advantage of all his weapons and the ability to take the most damage. Penny is a certified computer whiz, and whenever players encounter a computer terminal in the game, selecting Penny starts a 'debugging' mini-game. In it, Penny tries to complete an electronic circuit from one side of the screen to the other by connecting small pieces before a timer runs out. As Inspector Gadget progresses, the ever-shortening time limit makes even this straight-forward game challenging. Penny is also the only character who can dive underwater, allowing her to access certain sections of the game. Brain is the smallest and most agile of the trio, allowing him to perform high-flying leaps and crawl into tight spaces.  Inspector Gadget's biggest asset is the constantly shifting, wide variety of gameplay. Levels differ wildly from one another, including lava worlds and underwater caves. In any given level, players will switch back and forth between characters and weapons dozens of times in order to defeat enemies and reach every item. Although it can become a little tiresome to have to swap characters for simple tasks like jumping up and grabbing ledges, for the most part it keeps Inspector Gadget fresh and enjoyable. Another minor gripe is the password set-up. The game's major sections are broken up into three smaller sub-sections each, and players only receive passwords at the end of each of the major sections. Therefore, giving up in frustration on level 4-3 means that you'll be starting all over again at 4-1 the next time you turn on your Game Boy. It adds real incentive to finishing the major sections in one sitting, but is a little inconvenient if you have to stop playing unexpectedly. The levels themselves are surprisingly challenging for even skilled gamers. For example, one section has players racing upwards through a tower while flooding water threatens to overcome you. Leaping from platform to platform while avoiding enemies, collecting items, and staying ahead of the rapidly-rising water is a real challenge. It's a great bit of old-school platform gameplay that requires memorization, skill, and a healthy dose of luck to complete. For the most part it's standard platform adventuring, but blended together and polished off with real class.  The visuals of Inspector Gadget are spot-on, choosing to follow the character models of the cartoon adventures. Colors are bright and clean, with a nice mixture of styles from level to level. Each level begins with a brief introduction by the Chief, who drops a few choice strategy hints. The still cartoons are a treat, and look like they're straight out of the cartoon series. Character animations convey the humor of the original series and all the wacky gadgets add variety that keeps the action from growing stale. When Gadget falls in the water his coat inflates to keep him afloat, and even the animations for henchmen and other baddies always has a touch of humor. The sound effects and music do the Inspector Gadget cartoons justice, especially for a GBC game. The music keeps the action rolling along at a brisk pace, changing from level to level and during mini-games. All in all, Inspector Gadget is a great platformer. It's got a huge variety of gameplay, has first-class visuals and sound, and is challenging for even skilled gamers. And while all the weapon- and character-swapping keeps the gameplay shifting, constantly having to make trips to the menus can grow a little tiring, too. I thoroughly enjoyed Inspector Gadget, and would recommend it highly to fans of the cartoon, even if you haven't seen it in years. The game does such a brilliant job of capturing the characters and humor of the series that it brought back great memories for me AND tested my gaming chops in the process. If you're in the market for a fun, original, and challenging platform game, Inspector Gadget is your man.", "date": "Apr 10, 2001"}
