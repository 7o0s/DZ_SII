Mystery Mayhem", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/29/scooby-doo-mystery-mayhem-2", "text": "has once again been transported from TV land back to the realm of videogames. This time Scooby has a different bag of tricks to make Mystery Mayhem a completely different experience from Night of 1000 Frights. With a switch of developers (A2M instead of Heavy Iron), the gameplay has changed from a platformer to adventure game. Now, Scooby and Shaggy are charged with finding clues and vanquishing ghosts in order to solve the mystery of Hambridge University's haunting, which evolves into a bigger scheme by tycoon Travis Sherman to scare people off their land. Do Scooby and Shaggy have what it takes to solve this tangled web of intrigue? Read on and find out.    Gameplay THQ must put something in the water of its developers. Its games usually exhibit the best use of a license possible. A2M's Mystery Mayhem continues this tradition. Scooby-Doo perfectly replicates the TV show. Each area you visit, whether its the Hambridge University, a movie set, a wild west theme park, the bayou, an island, or the Sherman Tech Headquarters is like its own individual episode (although the crimes are all linked together to make Mystery Mayhema continuous story).   At the beginning of an area, you'll be introduced to the paranormal activity -- whether it's a security guard scared by ghosts and flying books or actors chased from a movie set by mummies. Then, the cut scene switches to the wise cracking Scooby Gang enroute to its next mystery. Once there, Scooby and Shaggy will attempt to back out of exploring, complaining of hunger. All the while, you'll hear canned laughter in the background. Scooby-Doo is brought to life by classic sound effects and voice work from the cast like Scott Innes and Frank Welker.  Keeping with Scooby-Doo's main themes, as you adventure through Mystery Mayhem with Scooby and Shaggy, you'll have the opportunity to dress up in costumes to sneak past enemies unnoticed and play mini-games like racing to see who can eat the most food or partaking in an accidental mine cart ride. If you're a Scooby fan, you'll find all of A2M's effort quite charming -- especially the authentic animations. If A2M had focused on the gameplay as much as the incorporation of the license, then Mystery Mayhem might have turned into a decent platformer...   But, Scooby-Doo is a mixture of tedious adventuring and boredom-inducing play mechanics. After your mystery briefing, Scooby and Shaggy are charged with finding clues -- once five are found and verified by Velma, an elaborate trap is planned and the villain is caught. In between clues, Shaggy and Scooby will be given objectives like rescuing members of the Scooby Gang from whatever evil has waylaid them or capturing all the monsters loose in a given area. It's nice that A2M is mixing up objectives, but besides for the occasional mini-game or brawl with a ghost, Mystery Mayhem is nothing more than a glorified fetch quest.     You'll spend the bulk of the game searching for objects like keys, clues, required items (valve, saw, fuse, etc.), or pages from the Tome of Doom. Mystery Mayhem's quests are rarely clever or challenging. Need to solve a switch flipping puzzle so that a drawbridge, door, and gate open? Hints are scrawled on walls and boxes that tell you what to do instead of making you figure it out. Items are hidden in plain sight. The fairly linear level design and handy checklist mean you're never wondering where you have to go. In some ways, this is the perfect errand boy simulator.    Of course, things get in your way of fulfilling crazy item searches that take you from one side of an area to the other multiple times. There are ladders that need climbing, and tunnels that need squeezing through. The inseparable duo takes all this platforming in stride with kid friendly, context sensitive button pressing. Want to climb over a crate? Hit A. Need Scooby to crawl through a small opening? Press A. Need to push something out of the way? Tap A. Climb a ladder? A.  While the context sensitivity has been used in a slew of other games -- it doesn't work in Mystery Mayhem. It might have something to do with the extended animations you're forced to watch depicting Scooby climbing on top of a crate and then pulling Shaggy up after him every time you want to ~jump.~ Or, it might be because the puzzle/adventure elements and the combat are not engaging enough to make up for not being able to bypass ankle high debris.   Another odd decision is that you can play through Mystery Mayhem ~cooperatively~ with Scooby and Shaggy. You choose which character you want to play as, and then the other will follow you blindly. All it takes is a hit of the Y button to swap between the two for character specific puzzle solving -- except the only time you have to switch is if you want Scooby to crawl through a tunnel. The only time you're forced to play as Shaggy is when Scooby gets kidnapped.         However, all of these complaints are minor compared to the tedium of ~combat.~ While attempting to solve the mystery of the multiplying monsters, Scooby and Shaggy will be required to do some ghostbusting. This is done by opening the Tome of Doom, which can vacuum in paranormal creatures. Once close enough to a ghost, the Tome will attempt to suck them in -- but it can only do that if you weaken your enemies by mashing the buttons that flash on screen. Ghosts, mummies, etc. are only captured once you've worn down their energy bar in the same button tapping manner. It'd be alright if this was an occasional thing, but this is the only real action in the game -- and cleaning house of ghosts is often a requirement.   Even boss battles require little effort. You might have to suck up all the real ghosts so that you can tell which one is human -- not that you can't tell the difference between translucent spirits and a man with a sheet over him. Another battle requires you to run around an obstacle course for a few minutes until you tire out the villain.  While Mystery Mayhem perfectly replicates Scooby-Doo's campiness, it surely doesn't make for a fun gaming experience.  Graphics Mystery Mayhem isn't the most technically impressive game on the block, but its cartoon style does a great job of capturing the essence of Scooby-Doo. The art brings a certain charm to the title and resembles the new Scooby-Doo cartoon. Even the animations are impressive, capturing the stance and trademark expressions of each character -- whether it's Shaggy's goofy run, Scooby standing at attention, or Daphne's chiding posture.  Cut scene animations run on a different engine than the in-game models. To make the cut scenes 3D, the characters have all taken an odd rounded look. The art isn't bad, but the character models don't translate well into 3D.  The camera usually doesn't pose a problem, except in some small rooms where it's locked at a specific angle. This often leads to be frightened by ghosts when you're trying to trap them. Luckily, you'll be able to pan the camera around Scooby and Shaggy with the right thumb stick.     Sound  The sound in Mystery Mayhem is surprisingly good. Most of this is due to the cartoon's voice actors providing the voice samples for cut scenes and in-game dialogue. Adding to the authenticity is the laugh track that plays whenever a one liner is tossed out or something happens to Shaggy and Scooby (like tipping over the mine cart). Sound effects have also been lifted from the cartoon, so most of the effects should be familiar to fans of the franchise -- such as the screeching of feet suddenly coming to a halt.   The effects sound authentic, granted that most are provided by the cartoon. A good job has been done with atmospheric sounds, like ghosts moaning or the creaking of floor boards. Also, the music is campy, just like the cartoon, and melds beautifully with the rest of the game.  Mystery Mayhem isn't worth solving. While the game is an excellent use of the Scooby-Doo license -- that's really its only accomplishment. The authenticity lends a certain charm to the title that almost makes you want to play it, but then you realize how unexciting the actual game is. Fetch quests have never been a successful way to captivate audiences, although some games can pull it off because of story or some redeeming gameplay elements. But, Scooby-Doo's collect-a-thon elements are never counteracted with gameplay because Mystery Mayhem never really reaches a fun level. The adventure/puzzle elements are very straight forward -- you're usually told exactly what you need to do. The combat is atrocious. After my first ghostbusting experience, I didn't want to ~fight~ another enemy for the rest of the game (sadly, there were many more).Mystery Mayhem offers little reward and challenge is non-existent. Scooby-Doo is another victim of dumbing down games for kids. Just because it's for a younger audience doesn't mean you have to take away all control and make the game incredibly boring, easy, and repetitive. Scooby-Doo Mystery Mayhem is suitable as a rental for young kids or avid fans of the series, but will offer little enjoyment to anyone else.", "date": "Mar 29, 2004"}
