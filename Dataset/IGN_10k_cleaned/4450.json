Playing a government-aided professional sniper, having a model sniper gun to use in the arcades, complete with working scope, was innovative and fun. Unfortunately, console ports of the game lacked light gun support, though they still did a decent job of keeping in spirit with the game.   With the release of Silent Scope Complete, Konami brings us not only light gun support, but also every Silent Scope game in one convenient package. Silent Scope EX, an original adventure, is also thrown in the bag, giving gamers four full Silent Scope titles. But is this enough to interest gamers in an aging series?  Gameplay Gameplay is simple: move the reticule around the screen and shoot the bad guys. Really, that's it. This is a light gun game after all. Well, okay, there's a little more depth here because you have to zoom in and out using the scope, but it's still not on par with taking cover in game like Time Crisis.  Now, even though there are four games included in this package, there's really nothing at all that differentiates one from the other besides different environments and whatnot. In the later sequels, there are slightly more interesting scenarios that involve sniping from helicopters, underwater, etc, and in some levels you even have the ability to turn around. There are also a few levels that require a bit more thinking such as one that shows you the location of several potential snipers. It's your job to shoot them as they are identified. But these moments are few and far between, and don't change the core gameplay in any significant way.    That doesn't mean the Silent Scope games aren't fun. In fact, they offer up the same fast-paced, unforgiving gameplay of the arcade originals in just about every way. And contrary to popular belief, the controls using a pad aren't bad at all. Aligning your targets in the scope can take a bit of practice, but after a few levels, it becomes fairly natural. There's auto-aim feature in Silent Scope 3 and EX that helps immensely, but the other two games are still playable. Using the d-pad instead of the analog stick can also help with some of the more precise shots.  Of course, if you hate using controllers for shooting games, Silent Scope Complete does offer light gun support. You can use any standard Xbox light gun, but if you really want to go all out, Pelican has released a sniper gun for use with the game. Ironically, I found using the sniper gun made the game more frustrating, especially because it's not mounted to a cabinet. The gun is not small by any means, so the reticule would drift quite a bit as I tried to hold it steady. The size also makes the gun pretty heavy. Extended play with it really wears on the arms, and very quickly too. Additionally, calibrating the gun to work just how you want it to was more difficult than it should have been. This isn't a review for the gun, but in my use with it and the game, I always went back to using the controller because of precision.   So the gameplay is inevitably repetitive, that's no secret. But it's still good arcade fun. Each game also offers branching storylines and multiple endings, as well as a host of other modes that let you refine your shooting. Plenty of unlockables, too. Is there anything that doesn't involve shooting? Not really, but what do you expect?       A big part of what makes Silent Scope Complete enjoyable is the cheesiness of the storylines and dialogue. If the game were made into a movie, it would have to star Lorenzo Lamas and Lady Dragon herself, Cynthia Rothrock. The campy nature of the game is intentional by all means, and does wonders in making the game a livable experience. There are also numerous details that emphasize the silliness of the game. For instance, in one level there is a not-so-subtle reference to Metal Gear. Also, finding gorgeous women that have no place in any of the levels in your scope will grant you life.  Graphics Composed of old arcade ports, you can't expect much from Silent Scope Complete. Each subsequent title in the series appears to be based off the same old engine, with little to no improvements over the years. That means each and every title is full of low-poly models, simple textures, and jerky animations. Ultimately, the game looks like a high-res PSOne game. And even with the low hardware requirements there is a bit of slowdown when there are numerous objects onscreen. If you're expecting even first-generation Xbox quality visuals, you're in for a rude awakening.    Silent Scope EX on the other hand, features slightly improved visuals. And I'm really stressing ~slightly~ here. The water effects are a little nicer to look at, the lighting is more dramatic, and overall the game just has a cleaner feel, but not much more. There are even some follow-the-bullet camera shots when you make a big head shot, but the game still looks very dated. It would have been great to see this game get a severe visual upgrade. Maybe next time.   Sound Each and every title in Silent Scope Complete features what appears to be the same terrible voice actors. The C-movie script doesn't help things, with lines like, ~Next time you move without my permission, I'll take you out personally!~ But things aren't as bad as they sound; the cheesy voices and dialogue are actually staples to the series and give it that much-needed hokey charm. It's the sound that takes keeps players from taking the game too seriously, and makes the game a much more enjoyable experience.   The music in the game is a cross between bad porno music and early '80s crime sitcom themes. Again, nothing groundbreaking by any means, but the kitschy sounds help the game keep a light and surface feel - perfect for this type of game. Silent Scope Complete is appropriately names. You get all three Silent Scope games, plus Silent Scope EX. There are even branching storylines, multiple endings, training modes, and arcade and original modes (arcade/original is only in Silent Scope 2). Then you have the light gun support which no other home version of any of the games offers. Simply put, if you're a fan of the series, Complete is a no-brainer. For everyone else, if you're into preposterous storylines, terrible (in the best way, of course) voice acting, and fast, time-based arcade shooting, and don't mind sub-par visuals, give Complete a look. It would have been better as a budget title, but considering all you get, the $40 bucks is easy to overlook. Well, that is if you don't get the $50 sniper rifle, too.", "date": "Feb 11, 2004"}
