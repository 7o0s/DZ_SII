Cabela has returned with the 2005 edition of its popular Deer Hunt franchise once again and just as before, players are given the opportunity to explore the great outdoors and collect trophies from the comfort of their own living rooms. The series has been given a visual spit-shine and there are a few extras tacked on, but for the most part Cabela fans will find themselves in familiar territory.   As usual, the game kicks off with the selection of a character. The choices include a teenage male, mid-40's male, mid-60's male, teenage female, and mid-30's female. Why there is no third ~older~ choice for a female character we'll never know. Perhaps not many elderly women enjoy the sport. Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy, strength, stealth, resilience, and tracking. There are also three super hunters known as Peter, Jim, and Patrick that can be unlocked by beating each of the three difficulty settings. A problem with the character selection is that the different hunters are terribly unbalanced. For example, the only reason a gamer needs to choose the unskilled mid-30's female is if they insist on playing as a ~mid-30's female.~ Each hunter should have strengths and weaknesses that accentuate certain styles of gameplay. And with five different attributes and five different characters, that should have been easy.   The three game play modes of Cabela's Deer Hunt: 2005 Season include contests, missions, and hunt. The core of the game is the hunt mode in which you travel to different locations and bag a certain number of deer for that area. These start with public hunting grounds and advance into private ranches with more exotic game. Playing this mode is also the only way to unlock new missions in contest and mission mode. The contests are a string of skill shooting challenges that include indoor ranges and clay shooting. This is a nice addition to the formula that breaks up the somewhat repetitive pattern of buying gear and heading out into the next region. Missions are the same as normal hunts except that they include special requirements like shooting an animal from a specific distance or in a limited amount of time. Each area rewards the player with money that can be used to upgrade equipment.   Click For More Images Deer Hunter is also packed with hunting accessories that include calls, tents, blinds, and a large assortment of rifles. Thankfully, there is an auto equip function that outfits hunters based on each region. There is also a guide and expert advice options in the menu that gently nudge amateurs in the right direction before entering each region. Every kill is recorded and displayed in your choice of log cabins. Each trophy also includes a code that can be entered at the Cabela Games website in order to compare your hunting achievements with other gamers.   Once you gear up and head out into the field there are a few onscreen indicators that are immediately important. The small flag in the upper right hand corner of the screen indicates which direction the wind is blowing. Staying downwind from prey will allow for an unnoticed approach. There is also a health and stamina meter in the lower left hand corner of the screen. Health isn't usually a problem, unless you have an uncontrollable urge to drive the ATV off of a ridge at every opportunity. This can be very tempting after sitting quietly in the woods for an extended period. Sliding down a steep ridge or being attacked by a wolf also results in damage but only a couple of healing items are needed to remedy the problem. The stamina bar effects aim and the ability to move and quickly depletes when running through the woods. This insures that you won't be chasing down any fleeing animals.   Stealth is handled by a small meter next to the health indicator. A hunter becomes stealthier when they are crouched, hiding in brush, and motionless. When the meter is full you are one with the forest, and technically, woodland creatures should be oblivious to your presence. In theory this is very simple system that is supposed to let hunters get close enough to their prey to pull off a clean kill shot. In practice, it is difficult to pin down why or when animals will become aware of a hunter and take off.    When deer are spooked they go into evasion mode and run off across the landscape. When this works correctly, the deer will head towards an adjacent valley or clearing and eventually become stationary. However, the animals will sometimes go into a crazy mode that takes them in a semi-circular pattern over mountains, through lakes, or straight at the hunter. This erratic behavior can be used to your advantage. One method for scoring a very close range kill is to fire off a shot at a hard to reach target, and sometimes the animal will charge towards your location. At one point, a deer ran into me, and then proceeded to graze for a moment before it decided to become spooked again and continue on a mad dash for the mountains.   As with the other games in the series, a large part of how much someone enjoys this game has to do with their knowledge of the sport. The game is more of a hunting simulator than a romp in the woods. One reason why it may not appeal to casual gamers is the emphasis on hunting regulations and item selection. A large part of hunting is having the right equipment. Not surprisingly, a game sporting the Cabela brand on the cover is not lacking in the gear category. However, deciding between a massive selection of rifles and camouflage does not necessarily make for a fun game. Also, make sure to read the full list of hunting regulations. The game warden will issue one warning, but unwittingly firing a weapon near a lodge or hitting a fox with a vehicle can result in large fines.   Graphically, Cabela's Deer Hunt: 2005 Season is heads and tails the best looking hunting game on consoles. Previous versions of the game often suffered from environments that felt barren. Basically, there were too many large open spaces and a general lack of detail. The 2005 season has more distinct locations with a nice assortment of underbrush, environmental effects, and grasses that blow in the wind. We're not talking groundbreaking visuals, but it's nice to see a hunting game with graphics that reflect the current generation of hardware.It occurred to me while sitting in the virtual wilderness that Deer Hunter could learn a few gameplay tips from a more mainstream game that includes a bit of hunting and a lot of stealth. I recently played through Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and it includes a laundry list of qualities that the Cabela franchise could benefit from. It may seem far fetched to compare these games, but gameplay-wise they have a lot in common. Basically, deer hunting is about stealth and item selection, and Snake Eater has mastered these areas. First off, Snake Eater the environments have a scaled down feel that do not cover as much acreage but has dense foliage that makes outdoor stealth more believable. The parameters of the stealth system are also better defined. After a few trials, gamers are able to gauge what type of behavior will give away their position. When starting Deer Hunter, the animals seemingly bolt for no reason at all. Its one thing to have a very sensitive stealth system, but not knowing what sets it off is just plain frustrating. Snake Eater also includes a camouflage rating for how well each outfit blends into the backgrounds. Again, the game sets easy to define standards for how stealthy players are at every moment. The system is clear-cut and easy to adapt to, unlike Deer Hunters sometimes unreliable stealth meter. Anyhow, the Deer Hunt games have continuously made improvements in the area of graphics and presentation. Hopefully, the gameplay will receive a major overhaul in the next installment. For now, though, Cabela has released another solid deer hunting game which will likely appeal to most fans of the genre. This is basically a better looking version of last years game, but a quality purchase for hunting enthusiasts who are new to the series.", "date": "Sep 1, 2004"}
