{"name": "Samurai Ghost (Arcade)", "name_review": "Samurai Ghost Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/30/samurai-ghost-review", "text": "Playing Samurai Ghost is like trying to perform a puppet show with three malfunctioning marionettes. It's a side-scrolling action game from the TurboGrafx that bills itself as an intense, high-energy quest through feudal Japan  but its play control is so odd and off-putting that it feels like you're getting your hero tangled up into a mess of invisible strings as you play it. And because of that, it loses any energy it might have had; the appeal of its setting and story are lost, and you're left wondering why you just wasted 600 Wii Points on what is, currently, the second worst Turbo title on offer in the Wii Shop.   It's still better than China Warrior, thankfully enough, but that's about the highest praise you can give to Samurai Ghost. This game tells the tale of Kagekiyo, a samurai warrior who's been brought back from the grave for the purpose of re-defeating a gang of demons he already defeated once, back when he was alive. And he seeks to do so by running through a variety of fantasy environments, jumping and swinging his sword around wildly, like some kind of possessed action figure not in control of his own extremities.   Because Kagekiyo feels like his body's made up of independent puppets. That's not part of the game's plot or anything, it's just the impression you get from trying to control him  his legs operate and animate as if unconnected to his torso, and the arm holding his sword similarly flies freely around in wide, arcing circles that seem to have no effect on the momentum of the rest of his body. When you run and jump in Samurai Ghost, Kagekiyo's upper body stays perfectly rigid and upright as his legs curl up into odd leaping animations. When you press the attack button in Samurai Ghost, Kagekiyo's upper body similarly stays quite contentedly still while his blade flies up above his head, or swings out in front of him, or plunges into the ground below.     It's like he's got the best posture in the history of video game heroes, and it looks incredibly weird. What's more, the disconnectedness displayed visually from the hero is paired with poor hit detection and slow responsiveness from the game's controls, which all work together to make playing Samurai Ghost feel like a horrible mess. You'll constantly find yourself missing an enemy who's right in front of you when you try to attack him, or slipping off a platform that should have represented an easy jump, or taking multiple, successful, unintended hits while you try to get a grip on the absolute slop that is trying to get Kagekiyo to move.   The game actually does offer a fair variety of backgrounds and styles of levels to progress through if you master the art of samurai puppetry, but even then it's pretty standard fare  some scrolling clouds and trees set off the expected forests and temples, while you end up facing boss character that seem like the leftovers from a Castlevania game. The soundtrack isn't horrible, as some of the songs seem like they could be pretty listenable  if it wasn't for the terrible sound effects work layered overtop of them. Kagekiyo, who looks already like a demented female kabuki, utters ridiculous, low-pitched cries when swinging his sword or taking damage from enemies. What I wouldn't give for Kabuki Quantum Fighter on the Virtual Console now  a quality game like that is needed to redeem the sour taste that'll be left in players' mouths after experiencing this horrible take on the concept of a red-haired feudal Japanese warrior running and jumping through a set of side-scrolling action stages. Keep yourself away, at considerable distance, from Samurai Ghost and its 600 Wii Point pricetag. It's not worth that amount of money at all, and you'd be better served to download almost any other title available in the Wii Shop instead of this frustratingly hard to control action game.", "date": "Oct 30, 2007"}
