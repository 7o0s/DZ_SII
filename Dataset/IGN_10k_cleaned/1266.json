Unfortunately, it falls just short of greatness.  Initially, the game seems promising. The mission debriefings have been helpfully translated from their original Japanese to English, plus there's a large amount of variety in the missions, including both air-to-air and air-to-ground attacks. The graphics are also done extremely well. So what's the problem? It can be summed up in one word: control. While it does feel like it's been tweaked a bit since the original release, players still can't roll, and there's a problem of not being able to dip the nose unless the wings are almost level.  While Bogey Dead 6 is compatible with Sony's new analog joystick, it still doesn't really help. And when you add up the costs of the game with joystick, it doesn't seem worth it. Still, if you're jonesing for a flight sim, you do a lot worse -- let's not forget Agile Warrior.", "date": "Nov 22, 1996"}
