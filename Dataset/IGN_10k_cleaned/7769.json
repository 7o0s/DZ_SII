Sure, apples are obnoxiously spherical, but then so's Father Christmas. Okay, so if you sat on a pineapple, you might be a bit peeved, but it's nothing likely to set your teeth on edge, flex the hairs on the back of your neck and waft a searing red mist of death and destruction up behind your eyes. Super Fruitfall though, might just give you second thoughts about the apparently inoffensive exterior of those packed-lunch stalwarts.   Previously, the game has enjoyed success on both Pocket PC and mobile phone in the guise of plain old 'Fruitfall'. Now however, publisher System 3 has shaken things up a bit to bring the title to consoles under the moniker of Super Fruitfall. Set to launch alongside Nintendo's Wii in the UK, this latest iteration of the grocery-tumbler adds both remote and nunchuck support to the mix, alongside a brand new two-player competitive mode.    At its heart, Super Fruitfall is a simple puzzle affair, which sees you tasked with rotating assorted, maze-like grids stuffed with a variety of different fruit. The goal is to manipulate these grids so that three or more of the same fruit type tumble around and eventually connect, causing them to disappear. Depending on the grid layout and difficulty level, this could simply require a couple of spins. However, as the game progresses, a certain degree of strategy emerges, as premature connections leave you with too few fruit of a certain type to complete the level. In total, Super Fruitfall features fifty different stages, split into five 'islands', each with its own largely arbitrary theming.   That might not seem like a lot and, to a degree, it isn't - we managed to blow through half the levels in little under an hour. However, from there on in, things get much tougher, with more fiendish level layouts and far more stringent time limits hampering success. Unfortunately, it's hard to gauge how long the rest will last you, given that simple trial and error is frequently enough to progress through levels. On more than a few occasions, we accidentally stumbled on the correct solution to a puzzle purely by blindly rotating the grid - and, by and large, once you've cleared the first lot of fruit, it's plain sailing from there on in. Admittedly, later in the game, far more thought and planning is required to complete puzzles, but that still doesn't make the earlier stages feel any less redundant.   That's not to say that Super Fruitfall isn't a compelling puzzler. In fact, it's just about as pure a casual game as you could possibly want - charming, compulsive, easy to pick up and addictive as hell. As we've already mentioned, there's even a surprising amount of depth to the proceedings as things progress. However, it's worth pointing out that the Wii version of Fruitfall features exactly the same puzzles as previous iterations of the game, meaning there's no real incentive for old-hands to revisit the package, no matter how entertaining it might be. Furthermore, it doesn't help that the original Fruitfall can be downloaded for a mere five quid, while having the luxury of playing it on Wii will set you back a whopping twenty five pounds. What's more, the new additions to this version of the game don't really justify that price hike either.    While it's possible to control the rotation of your grids by shaking either the nunchuck or Wiimote, that ultimately becomes an unnecessary and uncomfortable expenditure of energy - you'll more than likely quickly settle on the far more traditional one-handed approach, using the remote's d-pad to cycle back and forth. Similarly, the addition of two-player competitive mode isn't quite as successful as it could be. Essentially, having selected one of the five 10-level stages on offer in the main game, two players go head-to-head on the same screen, the goal being to clear their puzzles first.   It's problematic because the game doesn't offer any means of balancing out play between two people of differing skills - invariably, a player who's familiar with the puzzles will have the advantage over anyone who isn't. What the multiplayer game could ideally use is a simple power-up system which at least offers lesser players some opportunity for victory - as it is, games tend to be entirely one-sided with more experienced players romping to the end while the other struggles futilely.Essentially though, that's the problem with Super Fruitfall. It feels like a quick and dirty port of an otherwise interesting puzzler. There's no denying the game's got that addictive quality that means you're likely to find a few minutes spiralling into a much longer play session. With a bunch of new levels and a more rounded multiplayer game, Super Fruitfall could easily have warranted a purchase - particularly as it's the only entry in its genre at the Wii's launch. However, when you're essentially getting a game that goes for a fiver everywhere else - plus a couple of half-hearted additions supposedly justifying an extra twenty quid slapped on the price tag - it's difficult to recommend to all but the most diehard casual game fans. And if that's not an oxymoron, then we don't know what is.", "date": "Dec 7, 2006"}
