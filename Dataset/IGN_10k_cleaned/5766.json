Konami dropped the ball on this title, not once, but twice, and fans of the series had to grin and bear it very, very loudly.   Well, it looks like there are a few fans of the game in PlayStation development land. Known as Candle Light Studios, this development house set out to out-Contra Contra. Did they succeed?  The storyline is generic -- you're a space marine (sound familiar yet?), and you blast your way through alien-infested outposts. Almost as if you're a one- or two-man extermination company. Throughout the game you'll pick up icons that'll increase your firepower or give you back your much-needed health. You'll also be faced with tricky maneuvers around the levels, and you'll also have to climb, swing, and jump your way through the rounds.  Don't let the FMV and plot distract you. This is an old-school shooter that was made to appeal to fans of the original-style Contra game. It's obvious these guys watched a lot of science-fiction movies before sitting down and designing Assault. Literally, this game looks like Robocop killing Starship Troopers aliens.The game is very straightforward. Hold down the fire button, and walk from point A to B. Unfortunately, it's a little too straightforward, if that's possible -- you really don't need to manage your character's health in the game, since health replenishers show up at very convenient times. Heck, when alien bosses show up, you can just stand in one location and shoot him until he dies. There isn't any strategy involved in this game -- its biggest downfall.Contra was all about figuring out how to handle the different style aliens. Do you wait for them to jump before shooting them, do you duck? What about the bosses? Where's the weakspot on that guy? In Assault, bosses pose no challenge, and all the cannon-fodder aliens just run to you before getting hit by your guns.Assault has a very generic feel, and it wasn't really designed with any creativity. The game is really, really easy, so one or two times through the game and you're pretty much done with it.But, it's better than Contra: Legacy of War.", "date": "Nov 20, 1998"}
