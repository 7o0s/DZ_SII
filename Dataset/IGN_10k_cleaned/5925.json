{"name": "Madden 06 [3D]", "name_review": "Madden NFL 06", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/12/madden-nfl-06-7", "text": "The 2005 season marks a number of first's for Electronic Arts' seminal pigskinner, Madden NFL. Not only is this the first season it has the exclusive NFL license (effectively freezing out all competition), but also the first season where the oodles of platforms already hosting the game are joined by wireless. Madden NFL 06 has arrived on several handsets in a variety of forms, including a 3D edition which I played extensively on an LG VX8000.   EA Mobile set the bar pretty high with this game, touting it as the greatest footballer to ever debut on handsets. We all know how much pedigree the name comes with. And after playing EA Mobile's Need for Speed Underground 2 on the same handset, I entered Madden NFL 06 with a set of expectations that I wasn't sure the game could meet. And, as much as I tried to side step these expectations, it was ultimately futile -- especially for somebody who has played the franchise since the heady Genesis days. So, it will with some regret that I must report that Madden NFL 06 is not the end-all mobile footballer, the one that absolutely knocks out the competition with a stinging, single blow.   This isn't to say it's a bad football game. It's actually not. There are a few features that I really admired, such as the ability to play an entire season, but then essentially skip through some games by setting them to ~automatic.~ The computer then plays the game for you -- but the stats are counted in the overall season, even if you jump and start playing the games yourself.   When you first start Madden NFL 06, you can either choose to play a quick game or enter season play. In  quick game, you can simply choose the teams to hit the field, select whether you want to be the home or away team, and then get right into the action. In season play, things are a little different than you might expect. You don't actually shepherd a team through the season. You choose to play specific match-ups, depending on the week in the season. This severs some emotional attachment and is an almost inexplicable decision.   (You can also choose just to go directly to the play-offs where you play the wild card play-off games.)   Control in Madden NFL 06 is pretty much what you would expect. On offense, you control the quarterback and can either make the run yourself, or cycle through receivers and make the pass. Madden NFL 06 uses a control scheme that mobile footballers can get quickly familiar with. It allows them to get right into the game without much of a learning curve. Especially since some players will lose their hair while trying to find in-game instructions of how to play.   The playbook screens are deep, but they have some presentation challenges. The playbook selections are tiny and sometimes look more like chicken scratch than a drawn-out play. You can discern the numbers assigned to receivers, but still, I dunno why EA would allow this to get out the door looking like this. EA is big on quality presentation, and the playbook mess is so out of character.   In Madden NFL 06, you can choose the length of each quarter -- one, three, or five minutes. If you are going to play yourself, don't bother selecting minute-long quarters. You'll maybe get in three to five plays before the quarter is up, and that's just not enough to make a significant difference in the game. Five-minute quarters feel better. However, if you are setting it to a computer-controlled game, go ahead and use the truncated quarters.   Between quarters, you can view stats about the game and team, as well as make player substitutions. You can also just quit right out of the game, but still save any season progress. From the main menu, Madden NFL 06 features a ~Front Office~ where you can make player trades.   Now, with all of those feature sets out of the way -- how does it play? Not as smooth as you would probably like. The passes feel a little slow and sticky. Making tackles seems a little bit like a crapshoot rather than the art it is in one of the console editions of the game. And it really does fel like the computer is occasionally on the juice, because it can do no wrong for an entire game. I think a lot of players will really dig on having a polygonal football game on their handset, but Madden NFL 06 doesn't play any better than what's already out there. And, as I mention concerning the speed of some plays and the occasionally unresponsive controls (at least on the VX8000), it sometimes plays worse.   The in-game visuals are pretty good, when they are static. The player models look good and beefy. As soon as the game leaps into action, though, things change. Honestly, there are moments in Madden NFL 06 where I had difficulty figuring out what was happening on the screen. The little players met up in the middle of the screen, blurring into each other in a mess of angles and flashes of color, especially if the two competing teams have similar colors on their uniforms. The presence of nearly identifiable logos on the backs of uniforms is a nice touch, though. And when the ref makes a call, a little window opens up in the top right corner of the screen with a view of the arm-waving action.   Also fun is the little touchdown shuffle players perform when they enter the end zone. That's the kind of little detail I expect from an EA game.   The stadiums pretty much look the same, save for changing out the team names in the end zones. You can assign different weather conditions to the matches, but these effects are pretty minimal. For example, if you choose a wintry game, all you see are little white triangles float in front of the camera. The field itself is still green and doesn't accumulate any white.   Madden NFL 06 opens with a good little faux-thug riff. I must confess my disappointment that Madden NFL 06 does not feature EA Trax, the music download service that juiced Need for Speed with a bevy of licensed tracks. But the presence of two fully vocal commentators, John Madden and Al Michaels, is definitely a good consolation prize. The commentary is decent, with Michaels making the majority of the calls. My favorite moment comes at the beginning of some games when Michaels introduces John Madden... and then nothing happens. I dunno if I expected to hear Madden speak right away, but the silence is deafening. Sometimes the Madden calls repeat right next to each other, which isn't very cool. Michaels definitely seems to be more on top of the game.   As a fair warning -- and this no knock against EA Mobile -- players must know that the 3D edition of Madden NFL 06 is a memory hog. The game itself is approximately 2.8MB, which is a lot, even for the VX8000's total footprint. After DL'ing the game (which forced me to disable several other games), I was able to play it only once. The next time I attempted to start up the game, I was hit with a ~Fatal Error~ and a request to delete 120KB of memory. Okay. So, I went in and deleted some pictures, such as the pre-loaded wallpapers included with the phone and a video file. But when I went back to start the game, I received the same error. Still needed 120KB of space to play.   So I deleted more personal media files. No dice. If you confront this error, do not do what I did and delete personal files. The error message is unfortunately vague -- it means you need to delete some data in the application memory, which is where your games are stored. I wish the error message actually said that, not just used the blanket term ~memory.~ An excellent chap from EA Mobile was able to steer me in the right direction, which was greatly appreciated. The only drawback is that I had to go ahead and delete a game I was still playing, even though I had purchased an ~unlimited~ license. Disabling it did not give me enough memory to play Madden NFL 06.  Madden NFL 06 was developed not internally, but by a development house called Finite Monkeys. And it ultimately feels like they were rushed to get this game on the decks by ~Madden Tuesday.~ This is unfortunate, because I think a lot of people will download the game hoping to have a ~Madden experience~ on their handset, and just end up with an average football game, albeit one with above-average visuals and spoken commentary. There are still footballers coming from JAMDAT and THQ Wireless. Players may wish to see how those releases shake out before fattening their cellphone bills with their final football selection.", "date": "Aug 12, 2005"}
