While the console gamers get an impressive 3D rendition of the classic Anime series in the form of Robotech: Battlecry, Game Boy Advance gamers get this barely-average, blandly-designed old-school shooter, Robotech: The Macross Saga. Sure, it follows the storyline and features the same characters from the series, but that's about all you're going to get from this presentation; the actual gameplay is extremely underwhelming. Features Ten playable characters Ten levels Cooperative play for two players Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (four slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  The action of Robotech: The Macross Saga is split into two distinct designs. Most prominently is its side-scrolling shooter that as bland and old-school as you can get. In these unimaginative levels, players fly as one of eleven characters from the Robotech series (six of whom are hidden and unlocked only if you beat the entire game several times), blasting away at a seemingly endless swarm of enemy fighters. Players score experience points with every fighter destroyed, which can be converted into an attribute or two to their character's craft, including Power, Stamina, Strength, Speed, and Piloting. Every so often icons will float into battle that can be collected for additional health or firepower, giving players more weaponry and chances to wipe out the incoming threat.  True to the Robotech series, players can transform their ship into three different Veritech modes during the sidescrolling levels: Fighter, Guardian, and Battloid...an element that should have opened up a wide range of gameplay and level design ideas. Unfortunately, the implementation of the transformation mechanic is so half-assed that it's honestly not necessary to put it to use. If players fly around in Fighter mode, they can collide into the ground or any non-hostile object and take damage. If they turn into a Battloid, they walk around so slowly that they're pretty much a sitting duck. Guardian mode is the only mode anyone needs to play, since it's nearly as fast as the Fighter mode and the craft takes less damage...and, more importantly, players cannot accidentally pound into the ground and lose a craft. So, the whole transformation thing is just so the developer can say, ~See? We kept in line with the license!~  Secondary to the side-scrolling missions are the promising overhead levels where you control one of four different Destroids in an isometric perspective. I emphasize ~promising~ because, honestly, these levels are thrown together almost as shoddily as the sidescroller rounds. Players simply run around in this world blasting all the enemy threat, wiping out the necessary buildings or Zentraedi that inhabit the area. The challenge just isn't there, since players have ample opportunity to pick up health tokens and can outrun the enemy vehicles pretty easily. The engine doesn't even allow for players to move behind structures, which seems to be a technology residue from a past Lucky Chicken game, BattleTanx for the Game Boy Color. This overhead mode is what's offered to players if they take advantage of the link cable option...and playing against human opponents is definitely more challenging than these pushover computer AI enemies.  In-action graphics can definitely be described as ~lame,~ especially considering that the Anime series went all out with over-the-top animation of firefights and explosions. Background art is extremely rigid and dithered, and all of the vehicle barely move with more than two frames of animation.  The missiles, one of the staples of the Robotech series' animation, cruise around with a stupid-looking comet-tail trailing behind it...and only one at a time. It just doesn't seem like the development team had any passion for the series when developing the GBA game; at least TDK can be proud of what the console developer accomplished for the GameCube, PS2, and Xbox titles.  And the difficulty level isn't anything to keep gamers occupied, as any old-school shooter gamer can blow through this game in an hour...at the most. The boss battles are an absolute joke, as it takes no real skill or thought to take them out of the picture. The only thing encouraging replay is the hidden characters...but only Robotech purists will care who's hiding behind those question marks on the select screen. After seeing what the consoles got for a Robotech game, yeah, I'll admit there's a little sour grapes thing going on when I played through The Macross Saga. But it's obvious that the developers had no passion for the series, nor did they try to implement any unique ideas that used features from the series. The whole transformation aspect is a huge disappointment; I mean, they could have created levels that required players to transform into their Battloid mode to gain access to specific parts of the game. But nope...you don't need to transform out of the Guardian mode. So where's the creativity?", "date": "Oct 31, 2002"}
