Throw in some beer and cheese fries and you've got a great pasttime for big-bellied athletes...bowling. Tons of companies have created tons of bowling games for tons of systems, but it's only until recently on the consoles and PCs that the sport has finally been recognized for its intricacies -- just look at Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling on the PlayStation, for example. But while the Game Boy Color doesn't really have the horsepower to offer ~true physics~ or ~realistic 3D graphics,~ it certainly doesn't stop developers from making their own rendition of bowling on the portable system. Majesco did it (10-Pin Bowling). Jaleco did it (Pocket Bowling). And now, Vicarious Visions, the developer responsible for the oddly fun parlor game Pro Darts offers its take on the ten-pin sport in AMF Xtreme Bowling.  Features Eight players Practice, Tournament, and Two Player modes Hidden secrets Only for Game Boy Color   And just so you know, the fact that you might have a 175 average in the real sport doesn't mean squat here -- sure, it's good to know how the ball will react to weight, speed, and spin, but since this isn't really a simulation (it's more of a simplistic, arcade-style design), it doesn't simulate all the elements that goes into bowling. Ball weights are here, but in all honesty I couldn't find much of a difference between an 8 and 16 pound ball. Eight different bowlers are selectable, but all they offer are personality in the form of soundbites.  In the game, you position your bowler, set your aim by the arrows on the boards, time your power, and then time your curve (left or right). Work all these elements together to find the sweetspot that'll send the ball crashing into the pocket for a strike. All 8 and 16-bit bowling games have these sweetspots, and they're usually the item that totally kills the fun for me. And yes, AMF Extreme Bowling has the sweetspot. Simply put the player in the middle, aim at the second arrow, full power, with a curve a third of the way into the ~left curve~ area.  But you know what? I couldn't do it.. I made it a mission that I wouldn't review this game until I got a 300. But darn it, I just couldn't seem to keep the hotstreak going for more than nine strikes in a row. Which goes to show that even though AMF Extreme Bowling has a hotspot just like every other bowling videogame designed, trying to hit it consistently without fail is a lot harder than it seems. It's a real challenge to get the elusive perfect score.  While I like the well laid-out interface, I'm not a big fan of this game's pinfall algorithms. When there's a second shot to be had, many times an easy and well-placed shot will knock down front pins without even touching the rear pins. Natural reactions just aren't offered here, so it's all luck of the draw if your shot will pick up the spare. And since picking up spares are pretty much more than half of bowling, it hurts the enjoyment of the game when you can't pick up the easy ~4-6-7~ leave simply because the game's intelligence doesn't think the pins collided properly.  What I do like is the fluff. Character voices are as clear as you can get on the Game Boy Color, and in well abundance. The Turkey dance after three strikes in a row is rather silly, but it definitely adds a bit of flair to the overall design. And god bless the extra cart space -- this game has one of the slickest, most detailed FMV introductions on the handheld. Sure, it only lasts for five seconds, but hey -- it offers an ~ooh neat~ factor right off the bat. And of course, having a Tournament mode and a two player mode certainly helps the replayability, if only just a little bit.  Oh, yeah, one more thing: there's no way to see your entire score during a game...the interface only offers the current frame you're on, and only gives you the full score layout at the end of the game. Sure, there's only ten frames to remember, but come on...I ALWAYS need to see the past frames so I can calculate everything in my head, especially when I'm on a spare or strike.You gotta love those marketing folks -- this is Xtreme, baby. This isn't just bowling...it's On The Edge bowling. No, not really...it's just bowling. It's a decent, pick up and play game. Play once, put it away, pick it up later, play another round, put it back. That type of game. But its pin collision flaws do hurt the enjoyment of the game, offering a bit of frustration that shouldn't be there in the first place. Compared to the rest, it sits right there next to Jaleco's offering...it's all about the frills. I do wish the developers would've put in a Spare Practice mode as well as the ability to see your entire score during a game. But ah well, maybe for Game Boy Advance...", "date": "Jul 13, 2000"}
