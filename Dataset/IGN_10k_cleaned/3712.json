{"name": "Port Royale", "name_review": "Port Royale Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/06/13/port-royale-review", "text": "Hearkening back to the days when Pirates! ruled the computer gaming seas, Port Royale from Ascaron and Tri Synergy plays almost like you might expect Pirates! 2 could possibly turn out. The main difference is that the emphasis is definitely on trading instead of the swashbuckling adventure. Still, Port Royale delivers in this department with an impressive economic system and enough gameplay outside of trading to keep things interesting for those budding entrepreneurs out there.   Port Royale brings players into the heart of the high times of the Carribean and Gulf of Mexico, when the major European nations had begun colonizing the area as fast as possible and little towns and forts were springing up all over the little islands and coastlines of that sea. The game plays out from 16th century when the Spanish were largely in control of the area until the English, French, and Dutch had begun to take more control over the area in the 17th century and begun kicking the Spanish out a bit more. Each player will be able to start at any point in this history as the ownership of many towns will be different and the presence of each of the four nations will be in different proportions. Of course, depending on which nation you choose to be a part of for each of these periods, you'll have a different difficulty level depending on how powerful your nation is at the time.   Each game begins with one ship and a sum of money. There are choices as to what kind of ship you'll begin with and how much money as well. This one ship will be the beginning of your dynasty that could take a long time to finish. Eventually, if the game progresses far enough, you'll be able to have 10 convoys of 10 ships each. An armada of 100 ships for a merchant and hopefully a Governor (which is as high as you can go) isn't too shabby. Thankfully, controlling such a vast fleet of ships isn't quite as confusing as you might think, but will take a little bit of time to get used to, but I'll get more into that in a second.   As you begin your game, your main goals will be to gain money to increase your fleet, and gain reputation with one of the four nations in the area to attain the final goal of becoming Governor. The beginning of the game will find you trading more often than anything else as you build your empire. The economic system is a good one that will have players racing from port to port to catch that next good deal. There are several types of goods that are available for trade in several different categories. Food, commodities, colonial goods, and imported goods area all up for trade and all have different effects on the populace due to their nature. For instance, a shortage of food in a city will have a dramatic effect on the people that leave there, prompting them to leave, which will screw up the economy. At the same time, luxury goods that are scares such as pottery, isn't going to have much of an effect. Your job will be to find the best trade routes for your ship convoys and set them to gathering the and selling the goods. The trade system means that prices are constantly in flux, even when you're selling goods. Supply and demand is in full effect here, so the more you sell, the smaller the demand and smaller the price. And if that wasn't enough, there are plenty of other trade ships floating around the sea. You'll often see prices change as you sit there trying to decide what to buy because some other ship came in and either bought or sold goods while you were waiting. It works surprisingly well even if it is frustrating when you get aced by some damn computer controlled trader.   Complex trade routes can be established for each of your convoys, even allowing for shore leave and repairs to ships. This level of automation helps to create a playable game that would be pretty tough to manage later in the game when you have close to your max number of ships. Early on you'll probably be controlling a ship by yourself just to give yourself a better chance to make a better profit. The overall map of the sea will show off the location of all of your ships as well as the route they are running. Because of the nature of the travel and the game, moving from one port to the next can take quite some time. Thankfully, the game has a fast-forward button that allows you to move your ships across the water at record speed. When you hit this button, you'll see your ships in a zoomed out view of the map moving across the water. If any important event happens, such as one of your convoys getting into a battle or running out of orders to carry out, the fast-forward will automatically stop to let you take care of the situation. On the same token, the game allows you to pause at any time so that you can take care of strategies if you've gotten a little confused.   Money can also be made through the construction of buildings in the various cities scattered throughout the map. These buildings will produce goods that can be sold and traded for profit. Of course, to build these industries, you're going to have to have raw materials like wood and bricks stored in the town. You're also going to have to purchase a permit for building there, shich doesn't come cheap and also depends on your prestige in the town. Once you do, you can place a building just like you would in any RTS. It doesn't matter where you put the thing on the city map. In order to have enough workers for the businesses to run smoothly, you'll have to make sure that there is enough housing for workers as well. So building extra housing is a must. I wish it was easier to tell just how many extra workers are on an island while you're building, but it's a small thing. Once construction is done, you'll start reaping the rewards in no time. Construction of extra buildings like hospitals is also possible and will help your rating with that town.    Eventually, when you've saved up enough money, you can begin to expand your fleet so that your convoy has more cargo space, or so you can start up a second convoy. Additional convoys can only be created when there are additional captains available. And these captains only become available once you've managed to gain enough experience and prestige. Experience is gained through a variety of ways. First, every trade that you make will give you and your captain some experience. Likewise, every battle that is won at sea will do the same. But the biggest experience boost that you can get is through completing tasks for existing governors. These important figures only reside in Governor towns, which can be seen on the sea chart in color.   By entering a town and clicking on the governor's palace, you'll have access to missions that he gives you. These can be anywhere from delivering settlers or goods to certain towns to attacking a town with your fleet and annexing it for whatever crown you are allied to. The governor will also sell you a Letter of Marque that makes you a Buccaneer. For those that aren't familiar with this practice, it's basically legalized pirating. You'll have to buy a Letter of Marque to be able to attack each of the different nations. The great thing is, because it's legal, the nations that are allied to the one you have permission to attack won't get mad at you. However, if you decide to go into the way of pirating and just take on all comers without permission, you're pretty much going to piss everybody off and then you'll be in a world of trouble.   Whatever way you choose to run things, you're eventually going to run into trouble on the high seas. Naval battles are inevitable for you whether it be from pirates, buccaneers, or enemy navies. You can either run these battles automatically if you aren't militarily inclined, or run them yourself if you feel the need to cause some damage. If you do decide to wage a battle manually, there are several ways to deal with them depending on the ships in your fleet and the equipment they're decked out with.   There is only so much cargo space on each ship, and cargo, sailors, and weapons all take up the same room. So balancing your convoys is an important task. Having some ships that are dedicated to defense while some are merely cargo ships is a good idea. In order a ship to have offensive capability, it will have to be carrying cannons as well as ammo for the cannons. There are three types of ammo that the cannons can use. Regular cannon balls are good for taking out ship hulls, grapeshots (smaller cannon balls) are good for taking out crew, and chain shot (cannonballs linked by a metal chain) are good for taking out sails effectively. So your tactics may change depending on whether you'd like to simply destroy an enemy ship or disable it so your crew can board it and either loot it or take it over.    Even that decision, which seems fairly simple, will have a direct effect on your relations with other nations. If you capture a vessel and take it as your own, chances are the folks that put the money up for that vessel are going to be a might bit miffed with you compared to if you had just looted the ship and sent it sailing on its merry way. But if you manage to take and loot a treasure ship from another country, you're face is suddenly going to be on the hit list of every buccaneer in the area.   Controlling naval battles is an interesting task. First, you can decide to just tell your ships to move and attack on their own or you can control them yourself. With only 10 ships, you wouldn't think controlling them yourself would be too hard, but when you consider that ships can really only go forward and have to depend on the wind for movement (which is nicely shown through moving clouds by the way) and have to be facing broadside to attack, it's a tricky situation. Naval battles are run in an isometric view so that you can get a good look at the action. As with the normal game, things can be paused to give orders. Of course, if you want to speed things up, just hold the F12 key and you'll see things move faster.   The real-time battles are confined to the sea, but you'll also be able to attack towns from the land, which will be based off of how many sailors are on board your ship and how well equipped with weapons they all are. The game will automatically resolve these types of battles for you and will grant you and your patron nation control of the town after the battle is won. If you lose... well... too bad for you.   As you can see, Port Royale is a pretty comprehensive game that has a lot going for it. The main problem I have with it is that it takes so damn long to get started. It's just so slow. I was ready to write it off of for a while until I finally got far enough to buy some property and ships. It doesn't help that the tutorial isn't really complete and is really, really boring. In fact, the presentation in the game isn't exactly sterling in general. Despite the colorful graphics and good music, there isn't a whole lot of personality to it. It's just too bad.If you can get past the slow first part of the game where you're trying to build up a good empire and save up some money for new ships and captains (which will take a couple of hours at least), you'll find that Port Royale offers up a pretty in depth and rewarding amount of gameplay. The supply and demand trade model is near enough to keep any economic wizard enthralled for a while. But when you add in the role-playing elements of experience and prestige, you get a much more lively world where computer opponents remember who you are and will react accordingly.This game is certainly not for everyone, but those that remember Pirates! fondly will find this to be the closest thing since that classic to this type of a Carribean adventure.", "date": "Jun 13, 2003"}
