With over 150,000 subscribers worldwide, Ultima Online (or UO for short) claims a living and vibrant community of players of all ages and tastes.  Day in and day out, people live, love, fight, and die in the Ultima multiverse.  And now, years after its initial release, Ultima Online, still as strong as ever, has been reborn anew.  Ultima Online: Renaissance ushers in a new age for the game's inhabitants, giving former players a reason to return yet again, and welcomes newcomers with a more watchful and nurturing demeanor than ever before.  Renaissance in itself symbolizes a new awakening; a new age beginning... without forgetting what has been learned from the past.  UO:R (as it is commonly abbreviated) offers nearly all the features that long-time UO players have come to know and love, and yet brings with it entirely new concepts and systems that will keep even the oldest veterans of Britannia entertained for years to come.  Features Exclusive to the Renaissance Expansion  Twice the Land and Housing  UO:R's premier feature is the doubling of its landmass.  This in itself is a tremendous addition, allowing space for new player housing, more land to explore and adventure in, and it has brought in UO's most radical concept yet... the individual player's ability to ~consent.~  For years, all manner of players have co-existed in UO, often as companions and often at each other's throats.  Never has there been a mechanism that separated those players that would live in peace and those that would cause others harm.  The new land addition of Renaissance has given players a place to play to avoid direct conflict with other players, finally answering the prayers of many, less confrontational players.  Plunging the old lands into a post-war wasteland (now know as Felucca) and creating a nearly identical land that's lush and green (Trammel), players now have the choice to live in relative peace in the new lands or risk victimization at the hands of other players in the old provinces.  Methods of travel between the Light and Dark Facets have been provided to all players, making where they travel an ongoing decision, not just a one shot permanent change.    A Kinder Attitude Toward the Young  A new player tutorial is something that's been lacking in UO since the beginning.  With UO:R, an interactive beginner's guide is finally here.  As most current players sometimes forget, Ultima Online is not the easiest game to learn.  The client interface, character actions, use of skills, and the basic manipulation of the environment all takes some getting used to, making UO's learning curve take anywhere from a few hours to several weeks.  Once a player is situated, there's still a huge world awaiting the inexperienced newcomers, taunting them with its many secrets and dangerous waylays.  A new player must learn to make money, gain in attributes like strength and intelligence, and learn skills ranging from the most mundane fighting to the most complex crafts and magery.  To a veteran, it's all second nature, but to a newbie, UO can be a very inhospitable environment for those first several visits.  The new player tutorial is offered to newly created UO accounts, and sends new characters to the city of Haven.  Therein, most of the hardships faced by new players have been eliminated.  Haven offers a safe and isolated environment in which newbies can begin their knowledge of the game.   Help is also readily available from 'Companions', veteran players that have volunteered their time and expertise to guide newcomers as they learn the ropes.  With the addition of Haven, no new player can say they weren't given the chance to enter Britannia somewhat prepared.  Combat Enhancements and Improved Monster Intelligence  Perhaps the most argued about issue in UO (and it's a debate that will never end) is the balance of Player vs Player conflict, also called PvP.  Dozens of times in the past, players have faced a tweaked and rearranged combat system, often strengthening and weakening fighting techniques and skills multiple times.  Continuing the attempt to reach the nearly impossible goal of total combat balance between all styles and avenues of conflict, UO:R brings yet another radical series of changes into the game.  Spell effects have been altered, weapon skills have received boosts and complimentary modifiers, and even some weapon types have had properties both added and removed.  When asked, any veteran combatant in UO will say that the PvP world has drastically changed with UO:R.  The argument comes when different character types praise that the changes have made things better and others cry foul that things have become worse.  One thing is for certain though; the new PvP changes have opened up a great many new options for the competitive player.  From watching any argument about ~who can kill who better,~ it's clear that there is more variation in PvP characters than ever before.  That alone is a testament to at least one success of this new combat system.  Along with new character fighting styles, monsters have received somewhat of an overhaul.  While initial tests showed how truly horrifying monsters can be at their best, the final result of Renaissance's effect on its wild creatures is somewhat tame in comparison.  While it is true monsters have been treated to a more advanced pathfinding (something they sorely lacked before) and choose slightly better tactics than before, any benefit they've gained has nearly been lost in their decrease in overall reaction time and speed.  Even the most deadly of monsters are still not much threat to the seasoned adventurer.  If we see the permanent return of how UO's creatures acted while UO:R was in testing, the interest of thousands would be sparked anew.   The Party System  The new party system introduced with UO:R is the feature I personally like the most.  Never before could players align themselves with other players in such an intimate arrangement.  The party system allows players to join together to share fame, karma, looting rights, and private conversations among a few other useful features.  While the party system was released with a few glitches remaining in the system, it shows a lot of promise, and in itself offers a great new tool and playing experience.   New Intro Movie While it's not the highlight of what Renaissance has to offer, the new expansion did include a new introduction movie that foreshadows the events that lead to the splitting of the lands and the coming of the enchantress Minax, who is the primary evil antagonist of UO:R.    Other Pertinent  Features of Ultima Online: Renaissance  Customer Service In the years I've played Ultima Online, I've found both the in-game and personal support to be quite good and efficient.  Consisting of both paid technicians (Game Masters) and a vast volunteer force (Counselors, Seers, and Companions), help in the game itself is never more than a few minutes away.  Horror stories circulate about waiting hours for much-needed help, but considering the volume of calls the support receives, these cases are few and far between.  The personal support behind Ultima Online is punctual and efficient.  Be it account management or public relations, the individuals backing up the game are as hard-working and helpful as they can be.  Considering the contentment of over one hundred thousand customers is on the shoulders of so few, I think they've done a remarkable job.  Just last week I had a problem with my account being blocked, and after a series of emails with support, the problem was cleared up in good time.  Documentation and Online Reference If there's one area of UO that I'm most ashamed of, it is probably falls in the area of documentation.  After reading the Player's Manual that accompanies the UO:R expansion, my fingers were numb with all the knuckle grinding I was doing.  Glaring errors stung my eyes, incorrect indices and tables made me shuffle around uneasily, and silly stupid mistakes put me in that weird state when you're not sure if you should laugh or cry.  Labeling a picture of leather armor with ~plate armor~, and mixing up names and picture of monsters (including a monster that has NEVER existed in UO) is just the tip of the iceberg, unfortunately.  In the realm of 'going too far' the Ultima Online: Renaissance documentation even includes features of the game that don't even exist yet!  While later stated to ~not be part of the UO:R expansion~, things like the Faction System and new player housing are still mentioned prominently on the game box and in the manual.  And still, neither of these systems are active as of this writing, well after the release of Renaissance!  Likewise, the online player's guide contains dated information that simply isn't right anymore, and was dubious to begin with.  However, I remain a staunch and forgiving UO fan, and chalk it all up to the sheer volume of information and constantly changing nature of the game.  The development and programming teams behind UO do a good job of keeping players informed and updated on the Update Center section of the official webpage.  Still, it would be nice to have a lot of the misinformation lying around cleaned up.  And I don't know who is behind it, but shipping an unfinished product is just as bad as selling an empty box of Cracker Jacks to a colobus monkey!  It's just not a good practice, and reflects badly on the company in the long run.  Internet Latency and Overall Performance One of the biggest peeves among UO players is lag, or Internet Latency.  Basically, it is the slow down between when you tell your computer to do something online, and when it actually happens.  Caused by many things, including the speed and power of your computer, the quality of your internet connection or service provider, the route your data takes between you and your destination, and the destination server itself, it's clear that lag can vary greatly between each and every player.  To combat lag, UO:R offers over 20 unique game worlds in which a player can reside.  Choosing the one closest to you helps your connection speed quite a bit, and there are always ways to further reduce your lag for those willing to try.  Nowadays, lag seems less of a problem than it once was.   First Person Review of the New Player Tutorial Getting started in UO:R was a piece of cake.  Installing the software takes a few minutes, and since most of the three years' worth of patches is included in the new CD, the online patching doesn't take very long either.  Online account registration is also relatively quick and painless.  Although I've played UO for over 3 years, for the sake of this review, I began once again at the beginning.  After reading through the majority of the documentation that came with the CD, I created a character according to my tastes and entered the new player tutorial.  Almost immediately I was impressed.  What followed was an in-depth and personally-paced tutorial that took me through even the most basic of commands that the user interface had to offer.  Walking, running, viewing character information, manipulating objects, and even NPC interaction and mock combat are all included in the tutorial.  Veteran players often forget that things weren't so easy the first time around, and I found the tutorial to be quite valuable, as it allowed first person interaction.   After wandering through the tutorial dungeon and trying to get a grip on what a new player must be thinking, I jumped into the moongate to the city of Haven.  I found a quaint little world, with a surprising number of new characters running around.  It was obvious that several were fellow veteran players, but it was equally obvious that many had no clue what they were doing.  And rightly so...  Haven is where they are going to learn how to play.  I wandered around the island and found it to be equipped with every store and resource that a new character could ask for.  During my stay in Haven, I was approached and assisted by a Companion, met a few brand new players, and tried my hand at learning some new skills.  Overall, it was a very positive first experience, and I'm certain it would be invaluable to a truly new player.  After leaving the city, I entered the 'wild' lands of Britannia through the portal that clearly warned players not to enter until they deemed themselves ready.  If they did make a mistake and jump too soon, I found it was possible to return to Haven by visiting any of the Counselor's Guilds in the major cities of Britannia (a privilege that is lost once a character becomes skilled enough to graduate from their 'Young' status).  It's important to note that once a player's 'Young' status has been lost, they can no longer return to Haven.  That includes any new characters that are created on the account, which unfortunately may limit the Haven experience if multiple people use one account.  Renaissance Turn-Ons   Ultima Online is long-lived and has a massive interactive community that a player can easily become involved in.  Players can move at their own pace, choosing any path of character development they wish.  Players can own property, run shops, create items, and manipulate the environment more than in any other persistent massively multiplayer game available.  Ultima Online is constantly changing (evolving for the better).  Renaissance Turn-Offs   Also a negative, Ultima Online is constantly changing (sometimes becomes difficult to keep up to date).  Bugs, glitches, exploits and inconsistencies plague the system, ranging from annoyances to ghastly.  Fortunately, most of these never affect the large majority of players directly, and the vigilant development and programming staff is always busy repairing problems.  New game updates seem to be coming fewer and further between.  UO:R lacks an in-depth storyline.   Final Word Ultima Online may be an oldie, but it's definitely a goodie.  As any true fan can tell you, the good far outweighs the bad.  The time spent, the relationships forged, and the memories shared are the kind that will stay with many players for the rest of their lives.  Renaissance marks another important waypoint in Ultima Online's ongoing history, and it's a journey that I'm certain will continue for years to come.  -- Thalshara  To find out even more about Ultima Online: Renaissance, head on over to IGN's UOVault", "date": "Jun 9, 2000"}
