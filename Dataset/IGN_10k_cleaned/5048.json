Features:   Drive classic rods  Upgrade vehicle parts  Quick play and ~season~ modes   Muscle Car Mayhem is a top-down racer with good visuals, plentiful options, and bad controls. There you have it. When first starting the game, you will be reasonably impressed with the presentation, as the classic road hogs are instantly recognizable on the track. Yes, it helps that the other cars on the track are fairly non-descript, but nonetheless, it's good to see an attention to detail.   But this top-down perspective requires the game employ some funky controls that are never easy to get used to. First-person racing isn't necessarily easy for handsets, but plenty of developers have managed to make playable games, such as OutRun and MotoGP 2. You press up to accelerate, and press the pad left or right to turn, but when your car is pointing a different direction than straight up, there's a certain amount of disconnect that screws you about every three turns.    It doesn't help that the tracks are so tight. To beat the computer, who doesn't have to worry about figuring out a foreign control scheme, is an expert racer. It's able to easily navigate around fences, cone, and broken road. And it's also very adept at cutting you off. Even with a fully pimped hemi, you're often clobbered before even having a chance.   If you play a full game, not just the quick arcade mode, you can earn money to upgrade you car's engines, tires, etc. In the arcade mode, you'll find these upgrades actually on the track, but they never seem to really help.Developer One Man Band deserves commendation for Muscle Car Mayhem's good looks, but it's just not a fun racing game. We've played other top-down racers that had better control and actually gave us a sporting chance to place. The inclusion of classic Plymouths is pretty cool, but they deserve a better game to really shine in. Hopefully there will be a Muscle Car Mayhem 2 in the future, and it will yank the camera back down to earth.", "date": "Sep 29, 2004"}
