{"name": "Resident Evil: Director's Cut", "name_review": "Resident Evil: Directors Cut", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1997/10/01/resident-evil-directors-cut", "text": "Resident Evil blew everyone away with its spooky graphics and tight gameplay. No one had ever really seen anything like it before, and it helped launch a new genre of horror games, often imitated but never bettered. And then Capcom pulled the game from store shelves on March 31, 1997, apparently to ~make room for the sequel~.    However, that game is still a year away, and fortunately Capcom has wisely decided to fill the space between the original Resident Evil and its forthcoming sequel with Resident Evil: Director1s Cut. A collection of different versions, Director1s Cut contains the Japanese (or easy) version, the original US version, plus the Arrange mode, with new camera angles, rearranged scenes, and more gore.    The Arrange mode is essentially the same game as the original. Set in the same infamous mansion, it's again filled     with creepy zombies, mind-boggling     puzzles, and scary music. Still starring as     the same two officers, Chris Redfield and     Jill Valentine, the player ventures through the     mansion trying to find clues to eventually     unlock the mystery behind this dark and     scary house.   Of course, the biggest selling point of the game is the demo for Resident Evil 2, which is just phenomenal. Many people will no doubt buy the game just for this, so kudos for Capcom for making it more than just a cleverly packaged demo.    If you1ve never played Resident Evil, you owe it to yourself to try out this classic game. And if you already own it, well, there is the added incentive of the Arrange mode and demo. Resident Evil is a bonafide classic, and will go down in history as such next to Pac-Man, Mario, and I, Robot (well, maybe not the last one, but I sure liked it).", "date": "Oct 1, 1997"}
