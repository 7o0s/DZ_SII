Its announcement, promotion, and release have been so low-key that the whole affair makes one wonder who was supervising its production and marketing at Acclaim -- or indeed if anybody was looking over this game at all.  As it stands, Bizarre Creations has just quietly turned the game out, while Metropolis Street Racer and its upcoming Xbox projects have drawn all the attention.  If this were an irredeemably bad game, that would explain things right there.  It's not, though -- Fur Fighters certainly isn't great, and indeed it isn't recommended as a purchase to most, but it does possess enough redeeming qualities that it ought to have gotten some kind of push.  Instead, it looks as if it will fade into the ether even more quickly than the Dreamcast version did, which is rather saying something.  Oh, well, heads out of the trivia gutter.  The fact of the matter is that while Viggo's Revenge is cute in its cartoonish, cel-shaded way, it's crippled by moderate to terrible problems with its camera and control.  There might have been something to be done with its original presentation and gameplay concepts -- the multi-character structure had promise, and the overall theme of stuffed-toy slaughter is a kick -- but good ideas do not a good game make.  Gameplay  Fur Fighters on PS2 includes, for the most part, more of the same third-person run-and-gun gameplay that appeared in the Dreamcast original.  Five charming furries from the aptly-named Fur Fighter Village are sent on a quest to rescue their homeland's missing babies, as well as to thwart the plans of the evil General Viggo, through the application of a cartoon armory full of shotguns, machineguns, rockets, and other un-furry-like weapons.  This would be all well and good, providing nearly every aspect of the game's control was not atrociously bad.  However, nearly every aspect of the game's control is atrociously bad.  There are at least five or six control schemes to choose from, but regardless of which one you pick, it seems that you still spend half your time crashing into walls, staring at walls, getting stuck in corners, being shot at from behind while you try and turn around, and otherwise fighting the Dual Shock when you should be fighting the bad guys.  The overall level of accuracy is so poor that the game has to include a huge auto-aim assist as part of the default controls -- you don't aim so much as you flail around waiting for the auto-aim to lock on.  The aiming point is colored red or green depending on whether it's locked, which is a noble effort that quite fails, because the bright background colors frequently camouflage your crosshairs.     The camera doesn't help matters much, tending as it does to zoom far too close to your character when you draw near a wall, instead of drawing out the wall or turning the textures transparent.  It's not too easy to control your character in a theoretically third-person game when said character has suddenly disappeared, especially since that usually happens when you're backed up  in a corner.    All these problems render the level design and multiplayer modes more or less academic questions.  The single-player quest is long, and there are tons of deathmatch levels, but what of it?  The multiplayer mode in particular is a rather pathetic affair, with players getting stuck in odd parts of the level or ramming constantly into the walls while they desperately try to find a target -- on the rare occasions when they meet, it's a race to see whose auto-aim seizes on a target first.    Graphics  The main thing that sets this sequel apart from the Dreamcast game is the addition of cel-shaded characters.  The technique isn't as flashy as in Monster Rancher 3 or as well-integrated into the overarching style of the game as in Jet Set Radio, but it does make for an improvement on the comparatively flat Dreamcast version.  The bright splotches of color with which the game is textured adapt well to the shiny lighting, giving the characters a nifty cartoonish sheen.  Everything around the characters actually suffers a little in comparison, though -- the background architecture is composed of very simple shapes and textures.  Sometimes this works in the context of the game's style, sometimes it just falls flat, looking unfortunately amateurish.  That's a comparatively small complaint, though -- on balance, Fur Fighters isn't a bad-looking game.  The goofy animation and particle effects give it a big hand up, a la MDK2, what with the overblown death throes, silly celebrations, and fluff spewing everywhere in place of blood.  Sound  The sound effects are similarly charming, although some may find them an acquired taste.  This is the most British game to hit a Sony system since Team Buddies, in terms of accents, slang, and musical styles (and character design, in some ways, but that grows unobtrusive quickly).  Envision the intro movie to Team Buddies, the early bit where the Buddies are all grooving underneath the tent, and you've got the musical score to much of the game -- there's even a cool little extra in the load screens where you can add scratching to the beat by fiddling with the face buttons.  The voice acting is in the Spyro the Dragon mold, and similarly well-executed, with lots of silly stereotypical accents for all the stereotyped characters.  It's often surprising how much speech there is in the game, both lengthy cinematic dialogue and short gameplay snippets -- again, it makes one wonder how long this game was worked on, and why nobody at Bizarre Creations or Acclaim bothered to tell us. Fur Fighters' 3D control is too poor to allow any of the game's finer points to shine for very long.  It's a shame, because it could have been quite a success on PS2, lean as the system's library is when it comes to action-platformers of this type.  For a game that got no marketing, it's pretty darn marketable...", "date": "Jun 4, 2001"}
