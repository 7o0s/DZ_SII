I received the first one as part of a review package of SSG games around that time; most of the others accompanying it were either complex arcade titles, or war-based strategic combat. What set that original Warlords apart from its companions was the addition of attractive fantasy trappings. There were plenty of turn-based, combat-oriented strategy games for the PC before Warlords, and some were even fantasy-themed; but none of them quite caught that atmosphere. It was, of course, only skin deep; once you looked beneath the surface, Warlords still showed its board strategic warfare board game ancestry in its unit values, combat mode, stacks, and hexes. But it was a very pleasantly applied skin, and drew enough attention from reviewers and players for everybody to note the exceptionally strong AI. While other SSG titles didn't make much of a dent in the United States, the Australian developers easily established a strategic beachhead with Warlords. They built upon this, and were eventually able to infiltrate our American defenses with its successors, Warlords II and Warlords III: Darklords Rising.    Warlords IV is the fourth in this series. It's also the first developed after SSG split down the middle, with the fantasy-oriented products going to Melbourne-based Infinite Interactive. It might almost be called Warlords Back-to-the-Basics; not because it's a return to the original title I reviewed, but because of the elimination of a few major improvements found in Warlords II and III. Let's begin with these, since Warlords veterans might be more surprised by what's been left out of the game, rather than what's been added to the mix.   For starters, quests have greatly been simplified. Heroes no longer cast spells, though a new unit we'll discuss later can. The entire diplomacy element of the randomized, user-generated games has been removed from Warlords IV, meaning that you're automatically at war with all other players in singleplayer or multiplayer mode. You can no longer select the level of AI for each computer-driven opponent; and the AI will no longer resign, even when literally backed up against a mountain wall. None of this necessarily makes for a bad game, but it does reduce the number of gameplay elements that contribute to Warlords' configurable and strategic options; and from where I'm sitting, that's not a good thing.   Consider: deciding in Warlords III among a quest giver's three levels of challenges and rewards added an interesting sidelight to the game. Choosing the AI level of each enemy meant that you could control the game's flow, creating, for instance, scenarios where many weak opponents clustered in the field between you and another mighty opponent. Diplomacy meant that you could form temporary alliances with different AI players, which often produced interesting strategic complications in earlier product versions. (If you found it too annoying, you could always turn it off before starting a game.) All of these are gone. The only one that's been replaced in any way, the new, simplified quest system, simply chains four quests together before you get the ultimate prize. It's linear and repetitive, lacking the player involvement in decision-making that was so effective in Warlords III.   So why not ignore the latest release, go to bed, and set the alarm for a year or more hence when Warlords V will undoubtedly appear? Because the other side of the ledger, the one with the new or improved features, balances matters out and advances the cause for Warlords IV.     First, there's the ability to select the order in which your troops go to battle. The human player selects first, after which the AI get to choose. The unit that survives that initial traumatic encounter faces the next enemy, and the next after that, until all the troops on one side or the other have been killed. This procedure is a lot more engaging than the traditional setup of previous Warlords titles, in which the weakest units on both sides automatically duked it out, with both sides gradually working their way up their respective food chains. In Warlords IV, you have to consider whether that one storm dragon of yours will really be able to take out all those skeletons, or whether a particularly mean skeleton having the undead equivalent of a bad hair day will get lucky. Then, too, the creature that vanquishes an enemy receives the majority of the experience points from the kill: another factor you have to weigh before you throw your forces against a foe. This isn't anywhere near as complex as the combat systems of Heroes of Might and Magic or Age of Wonders, but it arguably puts more emphasis on user strategy thanks to its simplicity. You can always turn it off and return to the series' original mode of combat, if that's preferred.    Speaking of combat, if you take another side's city, you can now produce its units, with all their attendant advantages. This was one of the features I lauded in the original Warlords, only to see it vanish in the next release of the game. Races that are especially noxious to your current people may prove beyond rehabilitation, however. If you're playing the Dark Elves and take an Empire city, the only thing you can do is permanently raze it to the ground, presumably so your forces can perform rude dances on the ashes. (The extent of your racial hatred can be seen on the Wheel of the 10 Races, which you can access any time in the game. There's a great series of tutorial instruction screens, too.)   Another feature borrowed from the Warlords Battlecry series involves the creation of a persistent warlord. This allows you to place your own avatar in the game, though you're limited to a fairly short series of representational images. There's one warlord per side, each with a profession determined by one major and minor ability apiece selected from Combat, Divine Magic, Rune Magic Nature Magic, Summoning and Necromancy. Thus, a major ability of Combat and a minor ability of Summoning yields a Flameknight. A character of this sort has four pre-set skills (two per ability) that can gradually advance as the warlord gains level with each win. Returning to our Flameknight, she has basic skills in Morale, Weaponmaster, Archmage and Summoning. By judiciously spending advancement points on just one or two of these over a long period, a given warlord can become a powerful force, affecting many aspects of gameplay. (Note that since the warlord is supposed to represent you and grow in levels, the same warlord can't be saved in two different on-going games.) I've worked a warlord up to level 22. The game comes with several pre-configured Warlords grouped at levels 10, 15 and 20.   Your warlord is not automatically assigned to a given race. You can create a Black Druid by profession, combining Nature Magic and Necromancy into a cheerful if toxic cocktail, and still give him rule over the Dwarves. This really opens up the possibilities for fascinating mixes among the 36 warlord professions, their many skills and the 10 races with their varied and distinctive unit abilities.   But as much as I like the idea of persistent Warlords, the implementation has its problems. Being stuck in your beginning city for the duration of a game isn't one of them, though. I think that was an excellent idea, borrowed from chess. If you can't move your warlord out of one city, it forces you to put at least part of your thought into defensive gaming around a fixed point, where previous Warlords have been entirely about mobility.   No, the issue involves the spell system in Warlords IV. While your warlord keep their skills as they advance in levels, spells must be learned afresh in every new scenario. This was done to prevent a situation whereby a few long games could result in learning very high level spells, with nothing further to study. However, the solution that Infinite Interactive chose forces you to relearn spells with each new game (or scenario in the campaign), and that seems to me less effective. I have to wonder why no thought was placed into scaling down spell effects in early warlord levels, increasing their range and power gradually. This would have prevented the tendency to scream that occurs when you find yourself faced with learning Heal for the twelfth time.    In singleplayer mode, you have a choice of playing Warlords IV in a skirmish (you against one AI player) mode, on a randomly generated map, or in the campaign. There are some appealing configurable options on the random map, including the ability to control the number of magical ruins and cities, the kind of terrain, and the number and allegiance of AI players. (This isn't diplomacy; it's teams. Whatever alliances you create before the game starts remains in place throughout.) Multiplayer Warlords IV supports up to eight players (where appropriate) in hotseat play, play by email, Internet, network connection and on Ubi.com.    I've mentioned Warlords Battlecry, and that RTS series also provided the inspiration for the new style of campaign in Warlords IV. It's less linear; and although you have to conquer 10 specific provinces to win, you can ignore or attempt to occupy any or all of the additional 22 available provinces. Each provides some form of reward, which can come in handy when facing the enemies in major provinces.    Unfortunately, the Warlords IV campaign has no Fog of War, nor any option to turn one on, or off. According to Ubi Soft, this will be fixed in a patch. There are other major bugs that should never have made it past the front door. You can actually see all the contents of an enemy stack at a distance by clicking on it; and not just units, but the levels of units. (This can't be intentional, since half the thrill of the Warlords series has come from guessing what any given enemy was throwing at you as you road down to meet destiny, banners flying.) Warlords IV also has a bad movement bug. When you move units onto a stack that hasn't yet moved, all that stack's units act as though they've just moved as many paces as the newcomers. I even encountered instances where designating a move onto a stack but stopping short of finishing it still cut down the stack's movement points.   Game balance, too, appears to be off. In one game early in the life of a novice warlord I acquired a pair of hydras as allies. They do damage to all enemies at once, instead of just the one enemy they're facing in combat at any given time. This creates a guaranteed win with the AI set to Prince, unless you do something stupid like using your Warlords IV Player CD as a heat trivet while serving lasagna. (AI difficulty levels are Knight, Prince, King, and Emperor. Prince is absolutely no picnic, as anybody knows who has played against this setting against the game's ancestors.) I only had to send that stack into battle for all my troops to gradually rise in level. None of them got killed, provided the hydras were designated as my first attackers, and while the hydras got the most experience points, the others benefited, as well. Nor are hydras the only problem; I merely use them as an example. Some other unit abilities, like Vampirism, become strongly over-powered at higher levels. I suspect these problems will be addressed in a patch, but their presence is unsettling. Typically, carefully prepared game balance has been one of the strengths of the Warlords series, along with the AI, and mistakes like these and the bugs above make me wonder whether Ubi Soft hasn't pushed the game out the door before it was quite ready for primetime.    For the rest, I've passed on spending much time discussing the upgraded 2D graphics, because while pleasing enough, they don't raise much enthusiasm when compared with Heroes of Might and Magic IV. On the other hand, neither the AI in HOMM IV nor Age of Wonders II can hold a candle to this series. A burnt out oil lamp last used by the former governor of California, perhaps, but nothing that comes close to the shrewd strategic thinking, unit-building and aggressive momentum of Warlords IV. The moves by each enemy take time, but that's because they're genuinely playing out each turn. (And unlike previous Warlord games, you can check various statistical charts comparing all sides while your foes play things out.) Like another company dedicated to strategy titles, Stardock Systems, Infinite Interactive is more than capable of creating opponent AIs that will give the best gamers a strong challenge.  I still think Warlords IV should have included a greater range of new features, while the removal of others in this new release strikes me as incongruous and unnecessary. But some minor game balance and bug issues aside, it can't be denied that this title provides an addictive experience against demanding foes, using a range of spells, skills, abilities and units. I like the campaign setting, the persistent Warlords, and the new combat resolution system. More could certainly have been done, but Warlords IV does enough to win my approval.", "date": "Oct 28, 2003"}
