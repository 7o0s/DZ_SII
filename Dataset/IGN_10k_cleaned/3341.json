Though the game's based upon locations and situations from the films, it has more to do with games like Diablo or, to a lesser degree Gauntlet, and even though it abridges chapter situations as intense brawling gameplay, the game is actually a lot deeper than it seems to let on...and the two-player co-op is great fun that makes the game even more entertaining. Features Five playable characters Dozens of levels Cartridge save (four slots) Link cable support for two players (multiple cartridge) Only for Game Boy Advance  Griptonite's take on the Two Towers is somewhat similar to what Stormfront and EA created for the PlayStation 2. ~Somewhat~ being the key word here, considering that the PS2 has the power to drive realistic 3D graphics, orchestral sound and film footage integrated directly into the adventure, and other than the brief FMV clip during the introduction and a more dumbed-down, MusyX version of the Lord of the Rings score, that's about all it shares on a technical side.  The two games are, at their core, action-saturated designs situated in areas from the first two films, with several dozen levels of but surprisingly, it's the Game Boy Advance version that's the deeper of the two games. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' strength lies in giving the player their choice of more than five distinctly different playable characters throughout the adventure. Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Eowyn each have their own attacks, strengths, and weaknesses, and though the game follows the same story arc regardless of which character is chosen from the get-go, each of the level's required gameplay changes because each of these characters handle so differently from each other. Unlike the PS2 version, players of the GBA game will actually level-up their character in combat and earn points that can be added to several different attributes, as well as assign points to character-specific active and passive skills that build up their abilities. Earning these points will give Aragorn his two-handed sword capabilites, or Gandalf's many different magical spells. But players will have to do a little point managing to earn these abilities, as well as some serious orc butt-kicking. The GBA game is also much less linear than the PS2 counterpart, with more exploration required in each of the levels; players will have to wander the land and dungeons, triggering switches and buttons to open up exits later parts of the area.  The multiplayer aspect of The Two Towers is well implemented and a welcome addition, especially considering the PS2 version was single player affairs. The link puts two players in a cooperative challenge in the non-task-based areas of the single player adventure. Each player can use any of the characters they've built up in the main game, so weaker members can follow around the stronger players to build up their own character, and players can even use these characters, leveled-up in the multiplayer melee, into the single-player adventure to get the upper-hand against the level hazards. The only real thing that needed to be addressed in this extremely fun mode: players can wander off independently in the current area, but the game never shows an on-screen indicator of where the other person is. A simple arrow indicating the location of the other player, similar to the arrow that pops up to point to the current level objective, would have been extremely handy when playing multiplayer.  The gameplay shares more than a passing resemblance to Diablo, but without the monotonous click-click-click gameplay thanks to direct D-pad control over the character. But it's the graphics style that really brings the similarities to light; The Two Towers sprite-based engine handles a lot of enemies on-screen with minimal slowdown (only a little more so in the two player link), and all of the sprites have been rendered with a surprising amount of animation frames at several different positions. The game's ~gritty~ look fits the style of the movie, but it does tend to add to the game's slightly unpolished feel; some character movements are a little awkward to watch, and there are still a few lingering bugs in the game, glitches that actually turn off specific sprite collision detection during battles. It's rare but it happens. Even though The Two Towers is far from ~boring,~ it does get a little repetitive in its hack-and-slash design...but thankfully the cartridge save means that players can take a break from the action when it gets a little too overwhelming. It really shines in its multiplayer mode as well, but players will need to seek out another adventurer with his own copy to set off into Middle-earth together. One thing's for sure: Griptonite and EA's Lord of the Rings game is way, way, way better than the ~other~ game that hit the GBA earlier this year; for those seeking the proper ring, this is the One.", "date": "Dec 17, 2002"}
