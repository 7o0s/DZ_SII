The company opened its doors with  a good rendition of Bionic Commando for the Game Boy Color, and continued on with a great version of Ridge Racer for the Nintendo 64. Third time always seems to be the charm in this industry, for the development team has finally introduced its next project -- a Game Boy Color conversion of a NES classic, Crystalis.. It's kind of interesting to note that Crystalis was released on the NES by SNK, a company with its own handheld but pulled out of the market before the release of its game on the competing portable. Were they frightened? Hmm...FeaturesAdventure based on the NES gameUpdated cinematicsDigital audioBattery save with three slotsOnly for Game Boy ColorAlthough I've touted my oldschool videogame expertise in classic Game Boy Color remakes before, I have to admit -- I am not learned in the ways of the Crystalis. Oh, I've picked up the box, put it back up on the shelves, and sold a buttload of them in my retail years, but I've never, ever plugged the game into my NES back in the day. So what you're going to get here is a fresh look on the game, and not some poor shmoe reminiscing about the good ol' days.Crystalis isn't an RPG like Pokmon or Final Fantasy. Usually RPGs are classified in their battle engines -- if you wander around a land and enter turn-based battles, that's an RPG. If all your battles are of the realtime, hack-n-slash type, it's an adventure. Crystalis is like Legend of Zelda in the sense that you run around the land and swipe your sword at all the alien creatures of the land.And like Zelda, Crystalis' adventure revolves around the hero wandering the world in search of items that have been scattered all over the place. In the case of Crystalis, the task is to locate the four swords that have been wielded in the four elements: wind, fire, earth, and water. With these four swords, our hero can put a stop to the power-hungry evil magician Dragonia out for world domination. In order to locate these swords, our hero must complete tasks that will open up previously inaccessible paths. For example, you don't enter the world as an all-loved hero -- you have to prove your worth. Fixing the village's windmill will show everyone you've got the right stuff, and you'll be on your way. As the adventure progresses, you'll snag items which will improve the power of each of the swords acquired. Holding down the slash button for a determined amount of time will unleash a special ability that'll allow you to advance further in the game. Cavern walls blocking your path? No problem -- just use your sword and clear the way. And like the adventure type, you'll have to keep an eye on your hit points and mana points. Running out of mana means you can't call upon magic when you need it...but running out of hit points? Game over, my friend. Luckily you can save your progress at any point, and you've got three save slots to choose from.My real problem with the game is that it's just too darn linear. The puzzles aren't very puzzling -- head into a town, they'll tell you exactly where you need to go and what you need to do. Swamps instantly killing you? One of the village inhabitants will tell you how to get the gas mask to pass on through. The Oak creatures hard to understand? You'll find what you need close by. The only time I've only gotten really stuck in the game is from my inability to get through the waves of enemies chucking objects at me. Not once has a puzzle stumped me and put an impassable wall in my way. If you're looking for a taxing adventure, this one won't wrack your brains.Since I've never played the original game, I can't tell you if the game looks and sounds like the original. I can say, however, that the cinema cutscenes are extremely detailed using the Game Boy Color's ~secret~ high-color mode. The in-game graphics are of standard fair, and definitely show off their NES roots. Sound is the weakest element of the bunch -- the music isn't very memorable and begs to be turned down, and the digital speech -- what little there is -- sounds worse than a Speak-and-Spell underwater.The controls are very tight and smooth, but the game could use a tweak or two in the collision detection department. When battling against random enemies, if you get too close to them, you'll get pushed back and take a hit -- even if it didn't look like they were touching your player sprite. I found myself dying a few times simply from running into enemies when I thought I was at a clear distance.But the game itself is a good one -- just not an awesome one. It's definitely not of Zelda DX caliber, but there aren't that many extended action adventures on the Game Boy Color. And Crystalis will last you a decent time -- the game world is huge. The puzzles just aren't that tough.I went into Crystalis with a fresh mind - there's no nostalgia swaying my opinion here. The game is definitely good, but the quest puzzles are just too linear and silly to admit that the game is a well-written one. The collision detection problem is a minor one, but it can be attributed to a bit of sloppy programming, and the sound? Definitely not the game's high-point. I really enjoyed playing Crystalis, but Zelda trounces it left and right.", "date": "Jun 21, 2000"}
