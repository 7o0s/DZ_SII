Capybara Games has created a smart, engaging little platformer that reminding me of some classic 8-bit moments with a little rhythm action thrown in to match up with the movie's musical themes. It may look like a kid's game, what with little penguins jumping across ice floes, but if you have a little kid left in you, Happy Feet should be a pleasant diversion.  Mumbles the penguin discovers early in the game that he is without his heartsong, something every penguin should have -- so he heads out across the arctic landscape to find it. Along the way, Mumbles must collect purple musical notes that hang in the air above icebergs, glaciers, and all things wintry. In addition to picking up these musical notes, each level contains five hidden golden fish. If you recover all five, you gain access to little bonus areas. The golden fish aren't tough to find right away, but as you push deeper into the arctic, Capybara gets a little more devious about placement. You'll spy the a gilded fin in the bottom corner of the screen and have to figure out some way of getting down to it without dropping Mumbles in the deep drink.  The majority of the game employs classic running and jumping mechanics. You'll slide across icy ledges, hop on birds, and leap across chasms. While in the air, Mumbles can flap his itty-bitty wings to perform a Yoshi-esque flutter. This gives you a little extra height when crossing wider gaps or when you need to get the drop on a bird. Mumbles also slippy-slides on his tummy to shoot into the air. I really liked the level design, how things are constructed both horizontally and vertically. You really need to look everywhere to pick up all of those purple musical notes. Between levels, you see what percentage of notes you have uncovered, and if you are liked me, seeing anything less than 100-percent eats away at you.  Boss battles are clever. Musical Mumbles also engages in some dance sequences using basic Dancer Dance Revolution moves. You hit the thumbpad as arrows stream across the screen. Occasionally, the arrows will not reveal themselves until just before they cross the move mark, so you (and Mumbles) are kept on your toes. If you hit your marks, Mumbles will dance over arctic nemeses, like walruses.  Happy Feet is an attractive game. I tested it on a Sony Ericsson w810i and a Motorola KRAZR. Dominated primarily by white and blues, Capybara recreates the arctic landscape in classic 8-bit glory. Mumbles is a cute hero, especially when he flutters through the air or dances victoriously on his enemies. The game music is perky and fun, matching the atmosphere. Happy Feet is an enjoyable platformer. Level design is smart, offering simple challenges at first so you get your thumbs around the control scheme before dumping you into some treacherous frozen areas. The musical sequences are spaced so that you look forward to them instead of dreading yet another dance-off. The game is a tad short for an experienced player, but the hidden fish give collectors something to keep plugging away at. Happy Feet may not be the most innovative game, but it delivers well on what it promises: platforming and dancing. Every once in a while, the wheel doesn't need to be reinvented to have a little fun.After last summer's ambitious Cars, and this month's Super Shove It and Happy Feet, Capybara Games reveals themselves to be a new talent in the mobile arena. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they're up to next.", "date": "Dec 27, 2006"}
