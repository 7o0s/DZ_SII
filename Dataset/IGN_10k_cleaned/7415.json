Rather than go for the easy option by porting the current-gen version of the game and giving it a fresh lick of paint - which wouldn't have been such a bad thing considering it's the best FIFA game yet - the developers have gone back to the drawing board to create the foundation on which all next-gen FIFA games will be based. The question is, is it a solid bedrock or will it crumple under the softest challenge?   The short answer is FIFA 07 on 360 is a solid game. It's obvious EA has gone to great lengths to take the series to the next level, not just visually but also in the way it plays and feels. Regular readers of IGN will know how the new physics engine makes the ball and players react far more realistically than before, with blocked shots and unpredictable deflections as common in FIFA as they are in the beautiful game.    The beefed-up physics have a knock-on effect to the way the players control too: they react like physical objects that have weight, so it's much easier to knock an opposing player off the ball - albeit at the disapproval of the ref. As such it's easier to commit fouls when leaning simply into a challenge. Thankfully, though, you're less likely to be punished if you put the boot in just outside the box, because freekicks are no longer the foregone conclusion they were in previous FIFA games and, to some extent, even current-gen FIFA 07. Hoof a ball at the wall and it'll no longer sail straight through and into the goal, but will bounce off a defender. Naturally it's possible to angle a shot through a gap or bend the ball around the corner of the wall, but this takes much more skill. As a result it's more rewarding when you actually pull it off, and makes for a much more balanced, realistic game.   On the subject of realism, the energy levels of your players plays a much bigger part of the game than in previous outings, even when competing in a quick one-off exhibition match. Play a game with the sprint button held down and you'll quickly notice the deterioration of your team's fitness, with attackers lacking the speed to outrun the opposition's defence and even the fastest midfielder running a yard off the pace. Substitutions can be used to inject energy into a dwindling squad but with only three at your disposal it's much better to use your players as a team, letting the ball do all the hard work by passing it around. For the large part this works a treat, with simple passes often connecting providing your player is facing in roughly the right direction.   Through-balls aren't quite so easy to pull off, but that's not usually the fault of the player but a problem we encountered with the AI of our team-mates. In FIFA 07 on PS2 the CPU-controlled players made intelligent, darting runs that could split the defence if the through-pass was timed to perfection. That's not the case here, with wingers often dawdling on the sideline when you want them to run at the opposition. You don't have as much control over the direction of the through-ball either, so even when a run is timed to perfection your pass is often wayward and intercepted by a defender rather than rolling just in front of the feet of your runner. As a result build-up play isn't as satisfying and indeed enjoyable as it is in current-gen FIFA, which seems a bit odd considering EA got it so right on PS2 and the original Xbox.     It's much harder to score from open play too, although that's no bad thing. Knock in a cross and it's likely to be headed away by a defender unless your striker has space to attack the ball. Likewise cutting the ball back from the by-line to a man on the edge of the box creates chances to score, but directing a snapshot into the back of the net is much harder and taking an extra touch to control the ball gives the opposition a split-second to block the shot. Although welcome, this new level of realism may put some players off - especially those who favour FIFA's trademark extravagant goals and the generous scorelines that go with them.    Similarly, the awkward position of the d-pad on the Xbox 360 pad might deter players as it effectively forces you to use the analogue stick, which takes a little getting used to. It's not quite as tight or responsive as we'd like, so quick turns sometimes don't happen as planned. Admittedly this is a minor niggle and is more a matter of personal preference than a flaw with the game, but it's worth considering especially if you normally play football games using a d-pad.    On a more positive note, FIFA 07 looks fantastic. The animation is some of the best to feature in a football game and playing it on a Hi-Def screen is as close football nirvana as you'll get at present. Not all of the player likenesses are that great - you'll recognise Rio Ferdinand and Peter Crouch in the England line-up but Joe Cole looks like a disfigured brute with boy band hair - and their faces look a bit too plasticky, but it's still leaps ahead of its rivals, and that includes Pro Evolution Soccer on 360.   The teams, too, are all present and correct. Well, almost. As a lot of development time has been focused on getting the games mechanics spot on, some of clubs and teams that feature in current-gen FIFA 07 have been dropped for the 360 version. In fact, only teams from six of the top-flight leagues are present - including the Premier League, Serie A, LFP Primera and Bundesliga - as well as 38 international sides. On the flipside the team line-ups are now all accurate up to the transfer window, with Gallas playing for the Gunners and Ashley Cole lining up for the Blues. Naturally this won't please lower league fans who'll miss out on playing as their team, but the up-to-date team sheets are definitely a big bonus.   FIFA 07's multiplayer support is equally as welcome. Playing a match over Live was as lag-free as you'd expect, and, although we could only muster enough friends for a one-on-one, EA promises up to four-on-four competitions across two Live-connected consoles. There's also the interactive leagues to get stuck into, enabling wannabe football stars to taking their team to the top, all from the comfort of their own home.Although FIFA 07 is certainly the visual revolution we were expecting on Xbox 360, the gameplay is a bit of a step backwards for the series. Take the realistic ball and player physics for example: theyre a welcome addition and are undoubtedly a marked improvement over the restrictive preset animations featured in previous FIFAs, but its not as refined as we hoped it would be. Rather than adding to the experience it almost disrupts the flow of play, with players bumping into each other and recoiling when they should be sticking their foot in for the tackle. The AI (or lack of) of your team-mates is a disappointing oversight too, especially because EA got it so right in the current-gen version. However, FIFA 07 on Xbox 360 is definitely a solid foundation on which future games in the series will be beat, so were already looking forward to the next in the series.", "date": "Oct 23, 2006"}
