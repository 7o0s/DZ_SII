Thats not the case in Knockout Kings 2002 on the Xbox. Muahammad Ali, Felix Trenidad and Bernard Hopkins are easily recognizable thanks to the excellent face modeling. In fact, the franchise has made such a graphical leap on the Xbox that it barely looks related to KK2001 that came out last year for the PS2. While the graphics and animation are quick to impress, Knockout Kings 2002 is a flat out fun boxing title that blurs the line between arcade and sim action. Well get to more on that later, but just know that  there's plenty of that polish and shine that Electronic Arts is known for and it brings everything together very nicely in KK2002.The Features:Choose from boxing greats Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Roberto Duran, and moreAll new game engine allows for quick, responsive controlsMultiplayer tournaments for up to eight playersSelect from 10 real-world boxing venues like Wembley Stadium and Ceasars Palace.Taunt your opponents in the ringNew hip-hop soundtrack featuring LL Cool JGameplayThe boxing engine in Knockout Kings 2002 is supposed to be a bit more intuitive than previous editions of the franchise so as to enhance pick-up-and-playability. Intuitive isnt the word I would use to describe the control because an act as simple as moving your fighter closer to your opponent can be complicated for newbies, but its no problem at all once you get the hang of it. The boxers are permanently locked on each other so your boxers movements are in relation to his current heading. Up on the left analog stick moves your fighter toward your opponent, down moves him away and left/right starts him circling around the other fighter. Double taps in those directions execute dodges. Moving your boxers isnt much of an issue, however, because youll spend more time slugging it out toe to toe than moving around and using all of the available space in the boxing ring. This is one of the ways in which Knockout Kings 2002 plays less like a sim than an arcade boxing game.   It's when youre slugging it out toe to toe with an opponent that youll realize Knockout Kings is really a thinly disguised button masher that merely looks like a realistic sim.  It's a sophisticated button masher, but a masher nonetheless. X is your jab, Y is your straight right and A and B are your left and right hooks. An uppercut is available on each of those punch buttons when you squeeze the right trigger. Your low blow is on the white button, black is your signature  punch and your backhand (illegal) punch is on the right analog stick button. To throw shots to the body youll have to push up slightly on the left analog  (try doing that in the heat of a fight) to get your guy to duck and then use the punch buttons as normal. If you push up all the way, your guy will simply move in closer to his opponent. These slight leans on the analog stick is also lean your fighter to the left or right or back when you lean the stick down.That control system is what makes KK02 a sophisticated button masher. Youll have to be mashing the buttons because the punching animations in this game are fast and youll always need to be on the offensive if you want to win. But youll need to also throw the right kind of punch to hit the vulnerable areas of your opponent so you can maximize damage. This is the challenging part of the game that leads to all of that fun we mentioned earlier. Youll be able to appreciate the hand speed of Ali with his lighting quick punch animations, but youll get your tail whipped if youre not using your brain and throwing the right punches. Setting up opponents so you can crush them with Bernard Hopkins right hook or whatever your favorite/signature punch might be or even consistently throwing punches that catch the other guy off guard are nice touches that deliver the simulation aspect of the game.    A nice touch that we  don't  want to forget is that the health meters are optional and are defaulted to the off setting. Youd be amazed at how aggressively you fight when you  don't  know how hurt your boxer is.  It's also a good idea to explore some of the different camera options during gameplay. The default one is nice but youre looking at an entirely different videogame when you switch to first person mode. The boxing in KK02 is controlled chaos but its done in a fun way that only gets better when youre fighting against a buddy. The multiplayer aspect of the game is so fun that EA made sure to include a tournament mode so you and a sofa full of friends can keep track of an evening of videogame boxing. The career mode is functional but  doesn't allow as much customization as youd want to see. You have a limited number of trunks, gloves and physical attributes to choose from and one of these days were going to get an Xbox ring sports game that allows custom soundtracks. The fights themselves are tough with custom fighters because theyre so low in stats but progression through the ranks is well done with the tier system that requires a certain number of wins on one level before moving to the next. GraphicsThe look of KK02 is awesome. It looks the part of an Xbox game with extremely detailed fighter models and damage effects. As we said, youll know the fighters by looking at their faces, not their names. The models are so accurate that youll see the intricacies of Oba Carrs tattoos, the tough guy stubble on De La Hoyas baby face and the pure obesity of Butterbeans.ah..butter cupboard. But its the dynamic damage/fatigue effects on the boxers thats most impressive. Fighters start off fights fresh and clean but by the third round of a hard fight, theyll be covered in sweat that flies off their faces when they take punches to the grill. Were very impressed by the greased up look because of the technology behind it not because we like lubricated prizefighters. Likewise a tough fight will see fighters take on bruises, bloody noses, busted lips and swollen eyes. Sometimes, if the cameras in the right place and youre paying attention, youll see your guys face contort and deform as he takes a punch and the resulting welt or bruise will show up right after in real time. If not, the replay camera is always an option. The replays system does a good job of capturing the drama of the game. At the end of some rounds youll get the surprisingly good looking ring card girl, or the trainer talking to you or even highlights of the previous round. But the best replays are on knockdowns. EA has improved the triple play Bullet-Time replay so that youll see the killer punch from several angles before it cuts to one final slow-mo close up of the blow crushing the opponent. It switches to letterbox, the audio slows down and flashbulbs click in the crowd as you see the bum of the moment hit the canvas. EA made a wise choice modeling their replay system after the expertly photographed Raging Bull.  You put Sugar Ray Robinson in there against one of the DeNiro look-alikes in the game and tell me it  doesn't look like a movie when Robinson puts him down.The animation of the fighters is some of the best animation weve seen in a sports game. Even though the punch animations are extremely quick, each of the different punches has a unique look to it. A hook  doesn't look like jab or any other punch. The signature punches look especially dramatic with all of their whirls and wind ups. Best of all the fighters put their entire bodies into each punch, just like they're taught at the gym. You see torsos twisting and shoulders straining to bring all of that power to bear on some poor sap.SoundLarry Michael and Max Kellerman are good enough to spice up the boxing experience but quiet enough so that you  don't  ever get irritated at them. Honestly, you  won't be paying too much attention the announcers because youll be listening to the sounds of battle and the crowd more than anything. They fall behind often because the action is so fast but they do refer to punches and events that actually happen in the fight.The crowd boos when you throw low blows and cheat but other than that they just want to see and cheer for action. They  don't  take sides, they just want to see two fighters go at  it in the ring. The punches themselves sound decent but without the rumble effect to punctuate each clean blow, they wouldve been inadequate.The hip hop soundtrack is effective like so many of EAs other sports game soundtracks (hows that for targeting a market?). Uncle L's G.O.A.T. is a  perfect fit for this game, too bad he released it on a poorly conceived LP a year ago. Knockout Kings 2002 is a lot of fun and it looks amazing. Its as simple as that. The one major complaint I can come up with is the roster of fighters. Most of the big names are still in the game, but it seems like were missing a few of the beloved legendary fighters from KK2001 on PS2. Other than that, this game delivers a fun experience that will have you perspiring more than you want. Its the kind of game thatll start grudge matches between you and your buddies and cause lots of hoopin and hollerin with each brain twisting knockout. Even with the built-in two player appeal, depth could be become a weakness for this game. More fighters and a deeper career mode are luxuries that I would like to see in future versions because theyd keep me involved with the game longer. KK2002s boxing engine has it all over Mike Tysons Heavyweight Boxing but Iron Mikes custom fighter/career mode should be a model for the future of boxing videogames.", "date": "Mar 5, 2002"}
