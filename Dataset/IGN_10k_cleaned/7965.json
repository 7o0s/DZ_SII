One wrong move and they'll slide in, never to be seen again. There's sweat on your palms as the pressure increases and still that alarm continues to ring. Then, as all seems lost, you launch one perfectly-timed ball through a tiny gap, causing a chain reaction that sees your balls retreat backwards from seemingly unavoidable demise. You're safe for now.   That's actually what it's like to play a quick round of Actionloop. It's a constant attempt to stave off that seemingly inevitable end for just a few more seconds. Unlike many puzzle games that offer the occassional moment to gather your thoughts and prepare for the next stage, Actionloop is like a pair of thumb screws, squeezing ever tighter. Yes, it's fairly straightforward to begin but, by the later stages, this is one of the most difficult challenges you'll face on your DS.   It's important stress the game's undeniable thrill quota because, treading the same path as Mitchell Corporation's previous DS outing Polarium, Actionloop's a clever puzzler fighting to break through its rather bland exterior. Yes, it's hard to get excited about a group of multicoloured balls on a greyish background - and that's likely going to put some potential players off. But, as always, it's not the balls that matter, it's what you do with them.   Using the touchscreen to flick balls towards their similar coloured brethren, you must stop a moving chain of balls falling down a big hole. If you match three balls of the same colour, they disappear and the chain's movement is slowed for a moment. However the balls are also magnetic and attract ones of the same colour. So if you clear a group of spheres and leave two same-coloured balls at either end of the gap, the resulting magnetism sucks the balls backwards away from the big hole of game over.   Of course, if you played Actionloop-alike Zuma on PC or Xbox 360, you'll likely recognise the gameplay on offer here, despite those games originating from a Mitchell concept dating back to 1998. The big difference here is that using the stylus to flick your balls feels a lot more intuitive and precise than using a mouse or joypad input. For the most part this works wonderfully well but there are times when a panicked fling can send the ball flying off into the wrong direction - but that's due to the pressures of the game, rather than an inheritently broken control system.   Pressure is applied most in the Quest mode. Here you're tasked with working your way through a bunch of unique stages, each one adding its own new element to the mix. In some, the twist can be quite simple - like a differently shaped track your balls travel along - whereas others feature more complex additions, such as multiple points to shoot from or tracks that intertwine. It's one of the most enjoyably extensions of a simple puzzle premise we've seen on DS and works much better than many other puzzler's attempts to extend their basic concept into new territory.    In contrast to the fast-paced ball-flicking mayhem of the Quest mode is the Puzzle mode. Rather like Polarium, this is one for those DS owners that like to sit and stare at the screen while thinking. Unlike the Quest and Challenge modes, there are no time restrictions here. Instead you're given a set amount of balls that you must use to clear those already on the screen. Puzzles range from relatively easy to the truly fiendish. Although it's the kind of head-scratching offering most puzzle enthusiasts will enjoy, Mitchell seems the barest efforts on this mode's design. You're lumbered with the same grey stage over and over again but filled with different sets of balls. Considering that, for most of the time, you're just staring at the puzzle wondering where to fire a ball next, it would have been nice if Mitchell had included some different backgrounds, music or skins for the balls. Anything but that grey background throughout 60 stages.   That's the main problem with Actionloop. Although Mitchell has nailed the stylus control, created some excellent levels in the Quest mode and thought up devious puzzles, it hasn't gone any further. Puzzle games aren't renowned for pushing a console's graphical capabilities but Actionloop would have benefitted massively from a bit of pizzazz to compete with glitzier titles like Meteos or even Tetris DS.   What's more, the relative complexity of Actionloop means it's likely some players will never grasp the finer elements of the game. If you pick it up expecting to flick your way to victory by colours-matching alone, you'll quickly become unstuck. Although the premise is to match similar balls, taking advantage of magnetism and navigating gaps you create is where the true skill lies. In fact, it's a bit strange that Nintendo's targeted Actionloop at the ~non-gaming~ Touch! Generations market. Like fellow Touch! titles Sudoku Master and Big Brain Academy, Actionloop certainly requires a degree of brain power, but it's also essential to have some traditional gaming skills like fast reactions, accuracy and the ability to cope under pressure up your sleeve. Sudoko this is not.With 60 Quest stages to tackle and the same number of puzzles, there's plenty to keep you coming back to Actionloop. Thanks to the stylus control, matching up colours and clearing the screen of balls is both rewarding and challenging. If youre willing to invest the time mastering its nuances, then Actionloop becomes a very enjoyable, if tricky, addition to the DSs puzzle catalogue. Our only real complaint is Mitchells utterly functional presentation (although at least this ones in colour, unlike Polarium). Still, the majority of puzzle fans should be used to this kind of thing by now - don't let it put you off what's an otherwise extremely engaging DS offering.", "date": "Jan 24, 2007"}
