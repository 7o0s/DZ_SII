The latest in a series of soccer, football and hockey games has finally arrived on our favorite console, but like NHL 99, NBA Live 99 is not a port of this year's PSX or PC version, and it's not an entirely new game either. According to EA, NBA Live 99 (nicknamed ~the Soul of Hoops~) is the fifth product in the popular Live series of basketball titles which has sold over six million units to date. But if it wasn't for the ~99~ in the title, you would think what you're playing on N64 is actually the fourth one...Live on N64 has preserved much of the fun gameplay of last year's PSX version -- but it's not much of an advancement. Like with NHL 99, EA Sports had to create the engine from ground up and none of the excellent new features of the PSX and PC versions have made the cut. There are no facial expressions, there are no third generation 3D players, no player trade suggestions, no ticker scores, no new on-the-court chants, you won't find the enhanced arcade mode, and no new outdoor practice mode. Unfortunately, Live also didn't undergo any of the tweaking and graphics upgrades like the ones EA Sports implemented in NHL 99.GameplayNow that we've gotten that out of the way, how does Live play? Like Live 98 on the PlayStation, with one important difference: the nasty foul bug found in the PSX and early PC versions is gone. Though Live has all the trimmings of a full-fledged basketball sim, such as an excellent player creation mode, player drafts and trades, custom leagues, and team strategy options, the gameplay is fast and arcadey, much like NBA Jam or Hangtime. As a matter of fact, the default settings sets it up as a pure arcade title. If you want more realistic basketball, be sure to switch on the rules before you play.The game features the following modes: Exhibition: Play one game with up to four players. Season Play: take your team through an entire season (including playoffs), with 98/99 season schedules, and configurable season and playoff length, and an optional Feb. 18 trade enforcement deadline. In addition to trading players to another team, you can pick up and release players from/to the free agent pool. NBA Playoffs: Create your own playoffs (defaulted to the '98 season) 3 Point Shootout: A fun arcade shootout mode. Drain as many 3 pointers as possible in 60 seconds (for up to eight consecutive players). There is also an option split-screen mode for two. Arcade: If you ever meet anyone who likes this mode, write us. Actually, the only annoying feature here are the ~funny~ sound effects. The monster dunks are cool, bringing back fond memories of the original Jam games.One reason why Live comes across as an arcade title even in its ~sim~ settings is the liberal turbo use. Pressing the left C button will send you zooming across the court faster than Sonic. While this makes for some extremely exciting plays, it doesn't do much for Live in the ways of realism. Going for a rebound, even with slower players like Vlade Divac and zooming past the computer's defenses is usually no problem. Unfortunately, it also makes the game against the computer much too easy -- even in the high difficulty levels. This is not to say the AI isn't good. Teammates react intelligently to how you play and set picks, double team players, and so on, but experienced players will probably want to switch right to the highest difficulty setting to get the most out of the game.Live plays pretty well with the analog stick (although the control is not truly analog), but purists will still prefer the D-Pad for more concise movement. The passing system works like a charm. You can either play to a default receiver by pointing into his general direction, or hold R to bring up passing icons to pick the receiver you want. The same applies to the defensive play. To pinpoint a player, hold down R and press the corresponding C button.Because of the NBA lock-out, rosters are up-to-date as of July 1 '98. But EA included an interesting feature that lets you update the rosters via the DexDrive (see hardware section) and a Memory Pak from its website. Nice move, EA. On top of that, Live has the same excellent player creation mode of its predecessor, letting you build a custom team and players (name them, determine teams, position, left/right dribbling hand, jersey number, height and weight, college, years pro, head style, facial hair, features like sunglasses or headbands, endurance, shooting range, clutch ,and player ratings).Jam fans will also appreciate options for monster dunks and arcade ball physics, and EA even added an arcade mode with wacky sound effects. Sure, it's exclusive to the N64 version, but unless you've got a slightly weird sense of humor, we guarantee that you will play it once, roll your eyes, then switch back to the normal modes. There's just something unsettling about hearing ~boing~, ~floink~ and ~zip~ when you play basketball. As a matter in fact, it would probably get you beaten up by your friends... Speaking of which -- like most sports games, Live truly shines with four players, so be sure to invite some friends over when you plug this one in.All in all, NBA Live on the N64 is not as good as this year's PC or PSX version, but it's a good rendition of last year's game. It speaks for EA's game designers that that's enough to make it the best hoops title on N64.GraphicsEA farmed out development of Live to an outside source, NuFX Inc, which may have something to do with the fact that it doesn't look as good as it should. Though the graphics are clean and sharp (none of that In The Zone blur), the framerate is less than favorable, which in turn makes the animation look worse than it really is. Compared to Nintendo's Courtside, Live is downright choppy in both the gameplay and replays. Only the opening cinemas show off how good EA's motion capture really is.Like all EA titles, Live features well-designed menu screens and an overall pleasing presentation. However, there is also a downside to that: navigating the overdesigned menus takes forever since they swoosh in and out of the screen and never quite move as fast as you want them to. Still, Live comes across as a good-looking, albeit choppy entry into the basketball field.SoundAlthough nowhere near EA's FIFA series, Live's sound effects and crowd cheers are clean and add a lot of the game. The cool Live Band music has of course also made the cut. The jazzy tracks are a refreshing break from the incessant hip-hop featured in every other basketball game. Don Poier's play-by-play is a bit on the boring side, unfortunately. It's the typical EA N64 fare, where it's just enough, but nothing special. As in every EA Sports game review, we like to give the same advice (we just can't help it): please license or develop some new voice compression routines to fit more speech. With games like Rogue Squadron fitting an hour into only a few megs, surely something similar can be done in a sports game.If you look past the choppy graphics, Live is a fun basketball game that leaves NBA Courtside in the dust with faster gameplay, more exciting dunks, and more features. Unfortunately, there is no question about which version of Live is best. To be brutally honest, if you have a PC or PSX, forget about the N64 version and get the real NBA Live 99. If you only have an N64, Live is in my opinion the best basketball game yet, especially with four players. Could be a little more challenging in the one-player mode, though.", "date": "Nov 6, 1998"}
