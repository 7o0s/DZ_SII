And America loved it. However, after some bizarro legal wrangling forced the show's creator off the project, the quality spiraled resulting in Ren Hoek and Stimpy the Cat to submit to the stink of cancellation. After much time, though, the series has been resurrected by Viacom on the Spike TV network. And the stars of some very good video games on the Genesis and SNES are back in digital form, in Sorrent's new pinball wizard, Ren & Stimpy Pinball.  Features:  Two pinball tables Full ~Ren & Stimpy~ license Gross-out sound effects Slot machine unlocks bonuses  While not exactly highbrow fare, Ren & Stimpy Pinball is certainly an entertaining diversion from Sorrent, the publisher/developer known more for sports games than fart sounds. But fart sounds are what you get when you download Ren & Stimpy Pinball into your cellphone -- that, and a pretty good game of pinball.  Sorrent continues to prove that it knows its way around a license. In such a limited medium as a cellphone game, Sorrent gets as much of the essence of ~Ren & Stimpy~ right as it did witht he ~ALIENS~ franchise in ALIENS: Unleashed. The main characters are featured front and center, and the game uses familiar terms from the show, such as ~Joy!~ and ~Eediot!~ Hey, even Powdered Toast Man makes an appearance.  However, no matter how much fun squeaky fart sounds and Ren's face are, Ren & Stimpy Pinball would be a useless exercise without a decent pinball engine to back it up. Fortunately, Ren & Stimpy Pinball is actually pretty decent little game of silver ball. Ball physics are pretty sound -- not as good as some of the Game Boy Advance's better pinballer (like Pinball of the Dead), but certainly better than the crapilicious handset game, Space Taxi Pinball.  The ball appropriately, uh, pinballs around the game's two boards. Fewer frames of animation may make the ball's trajectory look a little choppy, but at least it's traveling in the right direction and at a decent speed. There are plenty of bumpers and whatnot for the ball to bounce off of, and if you feel the ball needs a little help, you can use the touchpad to  bump~ the virtual table.  Fly up ramps at knock into bumpers to up your score during the game, but the real bonuses are found in Ren & Stimpy Pinball's little slot machine mode. Two reels appear on screen and rapidly spin. Certain combos beef up your score, while others unlock little extras. For example, the ~booger~ icon and Ren's face change the silver ball into a gooey, green snotball.  Ren & Stimpy Pinball is certainly an ~attractive~ game -- at least, as attractive a game that feature boogers and cat butt can be. The two boards are bright and colorful with lots of little actions. The text that scrolls across the bottom of the screen is clear and precise. No question -- Ren just called you an ~Eediot.~  This being Ren & Stimpy Pinball, there is plenty of icky-poo audio, like farty noises when you let go of the plunger. Stimpy also squeaks out some gas when the ball hits the bumper near his bum. Sorrent smartly didn't go overboard, though, The whole game doesn't sound like an Army outhouse after Chef Cookie's chili surprise. Ren & Stimpy Pinball is actually a pretty clever little game. It's definitely slight -- one of those games you play for a few minutes here, a few minutes there. It'll get you through a boring meeting (as long as you have the sound turned down) or a break between classes. And, well, since fart sounds always make me laugh -- especially when beefed in public places -- I couldn't help smiling while playing. Classy? No. But Sorrent didn't release ~Shakespeare Pinball,~ either bubba.", "date": "Mar 3, 2004"}
