Hmmm...let's start with a little pretending.  Let's say you've got a series of dates lined up.  The first is with the most phenomenal woman you have ever laid eyes on.  Not only is she beautiful, but she is intelligent, funny, and responsive to all your charms.  Life is good, eh?  Yes, things are going well, but just to be fair, you've decided to go out on a blind date set up by your friend...let's call him Austin.  So, your boy Austin sets everything up, and lo and behold your date shows up on your doorstep.  But hold the phone.  This isn't right.  She has to be about the ugliest, rudest, most social lacking individual you've ever met.   But, being the gentleman that you are, you do right by your friend and ya take her out.  I mean, everyone deserves a shot, right?  Umm, I hate to be the one to say this, but that idea, my friends, is just plain wrong.  Some dogs are best left in the house, and after my appointed ~date~ with Acclaim's NFL QBC 2000, I feel it is my duty to inform you that this is one such mutt.  A mutt with rabies. And a bad leg.  And a heart condition.  And fleas. And did I mention it needs a bath?  ~But wait,~ you say.  ~Aren't you being a bit cruel, there?~  Hah.  NFL Quarterback Club 2000 is lucky I even bothered to liken it to anything that contains coherent form and personality.  Sad thing is, I honestly thought I'd escape this year without uttering the words, ~Good god, this game is actually worse than Soul Fighter,~ but unfortunately, it seems fate would have its revenge on my assumptions at the hands of this abysmal product.  This game fails, in almost every way imaginable, to live up to even a first-gen PlayStation football title, much less the glory that is NFL2K.  Visually, it has almost too many problems to list, but I'll hit the high, err, low points for good measure.  Let's start with the animation.  The game actually has some cool ones stashed away, like hurdles and sweet ditch moves in mid-run, but when I say some, know that I mean four or five, and after 2-3 downs, you have seen them all...about 50 times.  Especially the still animations.  Reason being that the computer seems to like having multiple players use the same animation at the same time as often as possible.  If one player is excited about a sack or scoring a TD, you can bet that 2-3 other guys are whooping it up like they were out to sell the crowd on a football rendition of the last Backstreet Boys concert.  Not only is it eerie, but it is just stupid, and it gets to that point fast.  And the frame rate.  Normally when I say to myself ~how'd they do that,~ I'm amazed at how smooth a game is for its platform.  But in QBC's case, I am just curious how they managed to skip a few dozen frames every second like that and not feel bad about charging full price for admission.  This game has problems everywhere...even in play selection (!) the game stutters, and every second or so, players just seem to ~jump~ a few clicks through the animation routine, almost as if they are severely lagged participants in a network deathmatch game.  Not only does this look utterly ridiculous, but it is harmful to gameplay, as well.  You can never seem to zero in on a play because of this, and it is REALLY hard to anticipate the ball or a defender because you never know where you really are on the field, as it can skip around so much at any given second that you'll be 5 yards past the ball before you even realize what has happened.  The problem is so bad that even a guy from IGN For Men noticed, stating ~it looks pretty good until they start...moving.~ Ouch. I could continue, but there's still gameplay yet to cover.   And man, just when I thought the visuals hurt, the AI and control came along and decided to show me the meaning of pain.  Forget how the frame rate manages to screw you over.  Let's talk about how the computer wouldn't know the meaning of the word coverage if you tattooed it backwards on its forehead and gave it a mirror.  I was open every single play against one of the best passing defenses in the league on All-Pro.  Pitiful.   Not quite as pitiful, however, as the receiver's apparent inability to catch the ball under said conditions.   This hurts bad enough when you are wide open and on the catching circle, but it is even worse when you go to the trouble of pushing the catch button and still manage to repeatedly drop the ball.  Not even with Carter and Moss could I make a consistent snag, and it's not like we're talking rocket science on a 4-yard toss when you are WIDE open.  Granted, you'll drop it every once and a while, but not every time you touch the ball.  Even the computer had trouble.  I am not sure where these guys got their player data, but even Andre Rison can catch a ball wide open standing still in the end zone...especially when given three tries.  Instead, CPU receivers remind me of the volleyball scene in the intro to Daria.  They would just wander off to the wrong side, hands out-stretched to the sky and then look down at the turf when they finally caught on that the ball had hit the turf a good 10 yards away.  How crazy!  Whatever.  And the running game can be just as bad.  Thanks to the game's overall control scheme, you can't simply run and cut unless you are really moving.  Unlike NFL2K where players can choose to walk, run, slide or juke based on how they manipulate the analog, QBC forces you to play the ~foot nailed to the floor~ game.  To make matters worse, it often sticks you on the back of a guard for up to 3 seconds at a time when attempting to follow a blocker.  Not only that, but some very odd things occur such as downed players getting seemingly ~kicked~ a good yard or so when they collide with another player after the ball is downed.  Stupid and unbearably realistic.   The same is true of defensive pass rushing.  I don't know how many times I went offside just trying to move my player over a couple inches, and the button configuration seems to have something against functioning as described in the instruction book.  Players would jump to bat a pass when I was pressing the button user to overpower a blocker, tackling seemed almost non-existent, and changing players was almost impossible in a timely manner.  Ugh.  Not that the game was 100% unworthy.  The running mechanism actually works pretty well when you're going full steam, and you can pull off some highlight-reel worthy runs every now and again.  The problem is how few and far between these sequences are due to the lack of functional blocking. And difficulty in actually making catches.  I also enjoyed the extras like the chain gang and team doctors rushing on to the field, but gravy can't do much on lumpy potatoes, my friends.  And I didn't even get in to all the bugs..eek.  When all is said and done, I can't help but wonder what Acclaim was thinking.  It is painfully obvious this game was rushed into stores for the holidays, and done so in a manner that reflects a lack of concern towards a quality product.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it is almost laughable that I am even reviewing this title, as it obviously didn't warrant concern or time from its company to deliver me competitive gameplay experience.  This game doesn't hold a candle the likes of NFL2K.  Hell, It's more accurate to say that Acclaim speaks an odd language where the concept of a candle can't even be defined by words.  I said earlier some dogs are best left in the house.  Well, some dogs are best left in the back yard in the rain, and sometimes, it's better to just put the 'ole girl to sleep.  Perhaps someone should have watched Old Yeller before letting this one out on the gaming populace.  At any rate, stay as far away as possible from this one kiddies.  Unforgivably poor.  -- Brandon Justice, IGNDC", "date": "Dec 8, 1999"}
