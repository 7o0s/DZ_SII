You slip into the hipster threads of a twentysomething with a short lease on NYC. Before your parental funds dry up, you must create an alter-ego avatar, grant it some social graces, meet new people, and climb the career ladder. That's a tall order for a cellphone -- usually mobile games are a little smaller in scope. But then again, New York Nights is from Gameloft. Ambition is nothing the firm shies away from, and New York Nights is nothing but ambitious.   Culturing yourself is the primary drive of the game. Working hard on bettering yourself in four basic categories -- Humor, Culture, Beauty, Health -- will help all other aspects of your life. Only through better Culture and Humor, for example, can you land a great significant other. However, you mustn't ignore your Health and Beauty, which leads you to the gym where you meet even more people, which can further up your social skills.   That's the genius of New York Nights, once you dip your toe in the scene, it pulls you all the way in before you know it. And it then attacks from all angles. Your first friend offers to introduce you to several potential dates. When you try to impress your date, you learn new social skills. Learning these skills in different locations (for example, you culture yourself at Lincoln Center) allows you to meet new people. These new people will give you tips on finding better jobs. At your job you earn money and meet new people, but to be friends with some of them, you must increase your character stats. Before you know it, you have 28 Culture Points, 24 Humor Points, $200, and wonder where the hell the last forty minutes went.   Meeting people is incredibly addictive. The game keeps tracks of your friends and acquaintances, kind of like Pokemon almost. Different people require different social skills before they agree to be your best dude and go on a date. Once you cozy up to somebody, you can have all sorts of discussions with them about things like music and sports (but you better only gab about what they are interested in or else you could lose points with them). Advance the relationship and you start flirting and gossiping. Gossiping in New York Nights, just as in real life, can backfire. You better know you your friend's other friends are, because if you suddenly start talking smack about the wrong person, your friendship rating will go south.   Managing all of this may sound complicated, but thanks to the easy interface, New York Nights is a breeze to nestle into. Thankfully, Gameloft did not make the game needlessly complex with having to collect objects. You can just concentrate on your personal stats, your money, and your friends.   New York Nights does not take its titular location for granted. When you step outside of your apartment, the city map features a city vista that includes the Empire State Building and the Lincoln Center. Other city locales include the Style Salon, Coffee Shop, and Club Sunrise. You will encounter the denizens of New York Nights at all of these environments, but they move around based on time. The clock in New York Nights is always counting down and when people tell you they will meet you at Point A at 7:00PM, they mean it. Show up at 8:00PM and you will be a lonely cat.   The game uses an isometric view for all of the locations. Navigating around the rooms with the thumbpad is easy, and mercilessly, Gameloft only uses one button for interacting with items and people.   New York Nights is also an extremely attractive little game. The in-game characters are look wildly different, dressed in duds that reflect their personalities. The locations are colorful and detailed, especially the nightclub and gym. While the locations themselves are somewhat small, a lot of details and features are packed in that miniscule real estate. The audio is also quite pleasing, too. All tasks have associated music, and the busier you are, the more you hear.New York Nights: Success in the City is another remarkable effort from the good ship Gameloft. This is a break from Gameloft's established genres -- action, adventure, action/adventure -- but proof that this form can pretty much tackle anything and spin it into gold. New York Nights will likely remind most gamers of EA's The Sims, and it's an apt comparison -- both of the game inspire addiction. New York Nights is a rare mobile game that actually deserves to be played for more than ten minutes at a time -- so keep your charger handy.", "date": "Apr 16, 2005"}
