Whether it's because of lack of effort on the developer's parts or if it's just a case of publishers wanting to make a quick buck on the NCAA, it doesn't really matter -- the end result is usually the same. Players looking for a college sports videogame have been forced to settle for a product not as good as the professional version and this is once again true with 989 Sports' NCAA Final Four 2001.   The problem is that Final Four 2001, while not a horrible game by any means, is just isn't quite as polished of a game as 989 Sports' own ShooOut 2001, which faced many problems of its own, nor is it near the quality of EA Sports' NBA Live 2001. Once again, fans looking for a quality take on the college game have been left in the cold without that many options.   Gameplay  The general notion of the game being good but just not good enough can be first seen in its features set. While it does have all of the basic play modes and features that people expect in a basketball videogame, it doesn't have as much as many gamers have become accustomed to. Yes, the game does have all the basic game modes including Exhibition, Season and Tournament modes, and it does track season stats for both players and teams, but neither the modes nor features are as robust as their pro counterparts.   For instance, the game doesn't allow players to adjust the difficulty level as precisely as you can in other games, as only the difficulty and game speed can be controlled and the levels of rebounding, steals, and other aspects of the game can't be altered. Plus, the game lacks the all-important franchise mode, so it's impossible for users to get the complete college experience. There's no way for the player to try and build a championship team and make it a dynasty by managing the loss of players early to the pros with good recruiting.   Beyond the inadequacies in the title's feature set, Final Four 2001 also sports additional problems with its gameplay. For example, the artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled players in the game really leave a lot to be desired. Whether teammates or opponents, the players without the ball just don't move and react in a realistic manner. More specifically, you just can't rely on your CPU-controlled teammates to move effectively to get open on offense and they are pretty much ineffective in one-on-one or helping out situations on defense. While this isn't important on the game's Freshmen difficulty level where the computer will often pass up open lanes to the basket and there's no reason to have good ball movement because it's easy to line up and hit nearly 100% of your three-point attempts by just about any player, it becomes a major pain in the ass when trying to compete against the computer when playing on the game's top difficulty level. Players will find it disheartening to see that the computer can easily blow past any of their CPU-controlled teammates for easy dunks more often than they ever should.   While the AI does provide a more than adequate challenge, the balance just isn't what it should be. As you increase the game's difficulty level, all that really happens is that it gets harder for you to hit shots and it becomes easier for the computer to block your shots and steal the ball. Even if you're careful and don't take that many chances, 20-plus turnover games against the computer on this difficulty level will happen more often than not. It's not quite as bad on the Sophomore and Junior settings, but the general number of steals in the game is a bit higher than it should be on the whole.   Another of the game's problems is that its Touch Shooting meter, which is one of the best ideas ever implemented in a basketball game, still hasn't reached its full potential because of a lack of polish and refinement over the years. The way it's setup, it's just insanely easy to hit over 90% of your shots from any three-point range on the game's Freshmen level, while it borders on impossible to hit anything from anywhere when you jack the difficulty all the way up. While it's a bit more balanced on the game's middle levels, it's still not quite what it should be. Even on the Sophomore and Junior levels, the meter can be a bit too small for open shots taken close to the hoop -- which should be easy shots for anyone playing basketball at the college level.   What's more, the whole idea of the shot meter can prove to be frustrating in cases where you think a player should go for a dunk but he instead pulls up for a short jumper -- in this situation players generally won't be ready for the meter and will miss an easy shot because of this. In the face of these different problems, it's a lot less painful for users to just turn off the Touch Shooting meter and play the old-fashioned way. While 989 Sports does have a good idea here, it just hasn't refined it enough to make it a plausible asset to the game.   Outside of the problems with the AI balance and the inadequacies in the game's feature set, Final Four 2001 does have some good things to offer the player. The control is pretty tight and there's never really a point in the game that will leave players feeling helpless or out of control. Unlike previous versions of the game, the character animation doesn't seem to get in the way of gameplay and there's not as many instances where doing a special move near the sideline will pull the player stupidly out of bounds.   Graphics  While NCAA Final Four 2001 does offer some nice visual goodies in the way of brand new player models and a nice variety of player animation in the form of new dunks, shots, blocks, and other moves, the game can be best described as being ugly. The developers deserve a lot of credit in giving us a fast-moving game with a solid framerate, but it has seemingly come at the cost of detailed player models and really fluid player animation.   The variety of the size and height of the models does help give the game some authenticity, but much of the visual splendor is just lost as then players are very blocky in appearance and they lack any sort of texture detail in their skin, faces, or jerseys. The players' skin looks overly pale and game just doesn't look like a 5th generation PlayStation game should look like.   Sound  Audibly, Final Four 2001 offers all of the basic things that are expected in a college hoops game. The announcing by Quinn Buckner is adequate and most of the stuff he says is timely and relates to what's actually happening in the game. What's more, there's a lot of varied crowd noises and chants, and the sounds of the shoes squeaking on the floor and the ball hitting the floor or rim sound quite authentic. On the downside, there don't appear to be any team-specific cheers or chants by the crowds and this is really one of the most important aspects in recreating a true-to-life collegiate atmosphere. It's in other college hoops titles and it's sorely missing here.  NCAA Final Four 2001 isn't  horrible and if you must have a college basketball videogame, it's definitely worth giving a look, if only because of the fact that it's the only one for any next-generation system, but it's far from good. The game suffers from way too many AI and gameplay problems to be something that we could recommend, though, and the lack of key features that have become a staple in sports games, like a Dynasty mode, really hurts its overall value and appeal.", "date": "Nov 28, 2000"}
