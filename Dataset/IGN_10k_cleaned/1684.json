{"name": "Persona 2: Eternal Punishment", "name_review": "Persona 2: Eternal Punishment", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/12/22/persona-2-eternal-punishment", "text": "One of the phrases I frequently use when describing odder games is ~points for originality.~ Doing a familiar thing well is fine and good, but pulling off something new and relatively untried is far better, in my mind, and so I'm usually more willing to forgive a game's faults if they're balanced by a healthy dose of originality.Persona 2: Eternal Punishment may win more points for originality than any other RPG this year. Tri-Ace's Valkyrie Profile takes the prize and keeps running as far as gameplay is concerned - it probably features the most original combat and character development of any RPG we'll ever see on the PlayStation - but you're not going to find anything with a setting and character as original (in the West) as Persona 2's.This is the damnedest game world to try and categorize. Veteran import RPG fans will just say ~it's Megami Tensei~ and leave it at that, but thousands of others will respond ~what the hell is Megami Tensei?~, so I'm left scrambling for analogies to define it appropriately. It's a blend of urban fantasy and supernatural horror, but all the comparable books and films are pretty obscure by now - stuff like Leiber's Our Lady of Darkness and maybe Heinlein's The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag, since it's not quite as far out there as the straight-up horror of Rosemary's Baby. Maybe Tokyo Babylon, the CLAMP manga/anime, would be a good comparison. The character design and the effect it has on the game's atmosphere are distinctly Japanese, but with their own twist nonetheless - nobody ever accused Kazuma Kaneko of following the crowd.There are those faults that I alluded to above. While its narrative elements are the highlight, it's still inarguably driven by combat and character development, which is a style that's fallen out of favor in RPG design of late. The hardcore, meanwhile, may object to the frequently bizarre translation. But the fact of the matter is, there is nothing in America even remotely like Persona 2 as far as story, setting, and characters are concerned - discerning RPG fans owe it to themselves to check this out.Graphics and PresentationThe best thing Persona 2 has going for it visually is Kaneko's design sense, and all that relates to it. He's done the character designs in Atlus' Megami Tensei series for several years now (Megami Tensei being the larger franchise to which the Persona games belong), but his well of bizarre imagery never seems to run dry. The character art, as well as the sprites and animated sequences that use it as their inspiration, is a fascinating melange of slick modernity, just a little retro fashion, and pure mythological weirdness - the Persona themselves have to be seen to be believed, shining modern renditions of ancient beings.What is a Persona? Interesting question, one the game's cast spends a good deal of time pondering themselves. To begin with, they have almost no connection to each other, until a series of murders draws a journalist, a detective, and certain of their associates together. All at once, they discover that they possess strange alter egos, mythical spirits calling themselves ~Persona,~ which allow them to harness fantastic magical abilities. Abilities they need, since a mysterious alliance of corporations, Mafiosi, shadowy celebrities and supernatural evil have some sort of ill intentions concerning the fate of the world...In case you're wondering, yes, the MegaTen series is set in something like the modern age, but it's not a world we would find entirely familiar. Demons lurk hidden in the corners of a culture obsessed with the weird, ordinary humans are awakening to their possession of powerful spirit alter egos, and the shape of reality shifts at an alarming rate according to whatever bizarre rumor is drifting across the internet bulletin boards today. Yep, BBSes figure in - this is probably the only RPG you'll ever play that features internet cafes, iMacs, fast food restaurants, gun-dealing taverns, devil-possessed TV stations, and a stooped little guy named Igor who runs the world's strangest piano bar.Which may make this sound like a farce, but it's not. Persona 2 plays it straight from beginning to end, becoming increasingly more unsettling as the story progresses, although I would hesitate to go so far as to call it straight-up horror. It's more like a fantasy with a serious kink in its brain - which, in case you're wondering, is certainly a good thing. Even if the game's visual presentation isn't the world's best, with fairly weak sprite animation and somewhat plain 3D backgrounds, the originality of the world and its characters makes up in part for the comparative weakness of the game engine.SoundThe same goes for the game's soundtrack. The music in Persona 2 is hardly a conventional RPG score, but somebody at Atlus is pretty deft with a pop hook - most of the mild beats accompanying city and dungeon sequences are oddly infectious. There are also lighter, weirdly amusing tracks, like the famous HAPPY CONVENIENCE STORE MUSIC and some of the other songs you'll find in shops and restaurants. For more somber moments, the game switches to classical piano, which I can always stand a little bit more of.While the effects suite is the one element of the game that isn't so unusual, there are some very interesting voice clips here and there, especially when demons suddenly start spouting off at you in high-pitched Japanese (the Angel demons are a personal favorite). The human characters are a little more inconsistent as far as voice quality is concerned, but some of the better sounds make putting up with the aggravating ones worthwhile.CombatWhile its style and character are what I praise above all else, it must be said that this is a gameplay-driven RPG, and in particular a combat-driven RPG. While it includes some of the most interesting alternatives to a fight that I've ever seen in an RPG, you will nevertheless have to spend a lot of time doing battle in Persona 2. The development curve for both your levels and your Persona is sloped such that you can't just charge headlong into most boss battles - the demon known as ~leveling up~ has full possession of this game.The combat system is a pretty basic one, essentially turn-based, with cooperative elements that you might recall from SaGa Frontier or Chrono Trigger. It's important to turn off the automatic combat option as soon as possible, though - otherwise you'll have to interrupt a continuously-flowing battle whenever you want to implement an attack, which makes planning ahead a little difficult. The conventional combat option breaks things up into clearly defined turns, much more easy to handle. Then the key tactic to be learned involves Fusion Spells, combinations of certain Persona spells cast by multiple characters. These are like the team-up attacks in the SaGa games - you learn them randomly, but after you discover them you can perform them at will. Two or three characters cast their spells in concert, and the damage inflicted is multiplied several times.Learn the combat system quickly, and especially how to use your Persona, because as I say, you'll need to do a lot of fighting in order to survive the boss encounters. You may even enjoy that part of the game, depending on your tastes. I generally detest this sort of thing, but even I fell into the curiously hypnotic rhythm of running around in small circles, fighting the same enemies time after time, and watching my party's abilities gradually increase. It helps that there are more than a few ways to develop your characters. They gain levels from experience just like you'd expect, but there are separate methods for developing the Persona you have, as well as summoning new ones.DevelopmentThe system of Persona acquisition and development is great fun once you get into the swing of things. You start out with some interesting Persona, and some will actually remain useful throughout the game (the Maia Persona has superior healing capabilities), but if you want to defeat more powerful enemies, you have to start summoning more powerful Persona.The currency of Persona summoning are Tarot cards, which you earn by sweet-talking Demons in the Contact system. This is that method of avoiding combat I mentioned - most enemies are perfectly willing to just talk to you if you strike up a conversation. If you have the right characters speak to them (each character has a different method of contacting a demon), they'll give you Tarot cards, or occasionally make a contract to assist you in combat later on (although that doesn't happen very often), and you can avoid the drudgery of having to kill them.Once you have enough cards, it's off to the Velvet Room (which has to be seen to be understood), where you summon your new Persona. There's a group of Persona, each progressively more powerful, that corresponds to each of the major arcana, so as your level goes up and you earn particular cards, you can buy new alter egos with stronger and more varied spell sets.Persona are not actually that powerful when you first acquire them, which leads to the final element of development through combat in the game. Persona go up in rank by casting spells, and as they rise through their eight ranks, they gain new and more powerful spells. Thus, it's generally to your advantage to summon and build up as many powerful Persona as you can. However, there's a bit of a catch - the cost of casting a spell, the number of Soul Points it consumes, is determined by the level of the Persona, not the type of spell. Thus, since two different Persona can cast the same spell for differing SP costs, you can often gain an advantage by holding on to lower-level Persona that you've developed to the highest rank, since they can offer more power for their cost until you develop enough SP to use a higher-level Persona.Story ProgressionAfter that hideous thrash through its peculiar game systems, I ought to stress that there is more to Persona 2 than just whacking demons. Its plot is lengthy and complex, and branching plotlines and character development arcs are affected by both your choices in certain scenes and the strange ~rumor system.~ The idea of consensus reality pops up in both story and gameplay - i.e., if you can get enough people to believe something, reality is changed accordingly. In other words, spread a rumor to enough gullible sorts and you'll reap the rewards or the whirlwind that result from its coming true. Early on in the game, you'll be introduced to a few characters that spread rumors for cash, and so you buy rumors like you would an ordinary item.I'll forbear using elements of the plot as an example, but to pull one out of the gameplay hat, you can expand the selection of items you can purchase by spreading rumors about black market outlets. If you need to buy a new gun, just let it slip that the local bar is a front for arms dealers, and suddenly you can pick a Beretta with your scotch and soda.The story, as I said, has certain branching points. Whether you'll want to go through the game more than one time to see all of them, though, is a question you'll probably have to answer for yourself (my workload has already answered it for me). The game is very long, and there are some powerfully tedious dungeons breaking up the fascinating plot sequences, so the rewards of multiple playthroughs could be of questionable value depending on how much tolerance you have for repetition.TranslationSome of the boner lines in the translation pop up awfully often, for one thing. Ah, Atlus giveth, and Atlus taketh away. Rhapsody and Thousand Arms were a step in a very favorable direction for their localization efforts, with much more natural text and better spoken dialogue than the industry average at the time. Persona 2, in contrast, is...well, pretty whacko on occasion. Opinions regarding this sort of thing differ, but for my money, ~The goodness of a woman isn't in her bra!~ has ~I got a good feeling!~ beat high, wide and ziggety. The text isn't consistently that goofy, and in fact it's quite readable for very long stretches (unlike Tactics, which was bollixed from beginning to end), but when it decides to spring a weird one on you, Persona 2 doesn't mess around.The spoken dialogue is pretty infrequent, so its middling quality isn't such a big issue, and the voice samples in combat are actually pretty amusing sometimes. One of Ulala's lines contains bleeped profanity, which was a pretty good laugh the first time I heard it, and Baofu's closing remarks, punctuated by the flick of a cigarette lighter, are pleasantly laconic.Persona 2 is not necessarily an RPG for the latter-day post-FF7 crowd, players used to a faster pace of progression, a simpler development system, and a lower difficulty curve.  If they have the stomach to hack it, though, I recommend they join the legions of the old school in giving it a shot.  After so many comparatively bland fantasy worlds, the wonderful weirdness of Megami Tensei's twisted reality is like a breath of fresh air.I thank Atlus for giving American gamers a shot at this one, even if I would have preferred a slightly...more natural translation, perhaps?  I have a moderate tolerance for that sort of thing, anyway, especially when a game has finer qualities to outweigh it, and Persona 2 certainly does.  Its unique visual style, its unusual characters, and its absorbing gameplay systems make it a game to kill plenty of hours with this winter.", "date": "Dec 22, 2000"}
