It's now 15 years later, the franchise has bounced around numerous console and handheld systems, and the focus of the title has changed dramatically from tactical maneuvers to hack and slash action.  The latest title in the series is Shining Force EXA which places a new twist on the Arthurian legends of old.  But has the luster dulled on the franchise?  In some ways, it has, although it's still somewhat enjoyable, primarily in small doses.   EXA is the tale of a group of four heroes: Toma, a young, impetuous swordsman; Cyrille, a mysterious magician; Gadfort, a virtuous knight; and Maebelle, a elven archer.  The four characters have joined together to search for a legendary sword known as Shining Force, rumored to provide its wielder with incredible power, but lost after an epic battle with an evil deity. Stumbling onto the sword in a cave, the four attempt to draw the sword from its resting place, with Toma coming away as the chosen one known as the Heritor.  As the Heritor, Toma becomes the master of a massive castle known as the Geo-Fortress.  Unfortunately for him and his friends, the drawing of the magic blade also sets into motion a massive conflict between the Human Noswald Empire and the humanoid Fyrlandt comprised of the Magnus.  Over the course of numerous chapters, Toma and his friends will attempt to use the power of the Geo-Fortress and Shining Force to save the world and end the hostilities between both peoples.   That's not a knife...This is a Knife! Unlike most RPGs, Toma and Cyrille are both playable characters that you can switch back and forth between during battle to take advantage of their abilities.  As a swordsman, Toma can wield one and two handed weapons with ease, while Cyrille uses spell books as a melee weapon and crossbows for distance attacks.  Depending on the weapon chosen, Cyrille can also cast magic spells at her enemies. The two characters can perform a number of combo attacks based on the weapon and the number of times you pound on the X button.  By holding the X button down you can charge attacks, or chain together a special strike by holding X after a combo that is much more powerful.  But don't think that you have to face off against the various giants, lizard beasts and other monsters in the game.  Players can select two other companions to travel with you in a support role, providing additional firepower and magical abilities during battle. However, you have no control over these attendants, since they're AI controlled.   Toma and Cyrille will also have access to various Arts as they explore their world, collecting them through specialized tablets.  Akin to skills, these arts bestow a variety of features on the main characters, such as improved health and magic regeneration, resistance to being stunned and extra damage against specific monster types.  There are two separate kinds of arts: Power Arts, which relate to the individual character, and Secret Arts, which can be bestowed upon weapons or armor.  You won't have to activate these abilities once you've acquired them, as they'll constantly be turned on for your character, but you will have to level them up with Mythril, a special ore to make them effective in battle.  For instance, being resistant to getting knocked back at level one is essentially useless, but powering up that trait will effectively plant your character's feet on the ground regardless of what monster hits them in combat.   Expect to go up against a large number of strange beasts. Unfortunately, the combat system is hampered for a number of reasons.  For one, there's very little strategy involved within the battle sequences.  Players can literally smack the button at will and be reasonably successful in cutting down a path of enemies, especially in Toma's case when he gets some of the larger two handed weapons.  Since there's no block or parry button, you may need to vary some of this with running around to avoid incoming strikes, and every now and then you might want to use the charge or special attacks to smash through large numbers of enemies.    There are two issues with this, however.  The first is the huge amount of slowdown that plagues the game because of the large numbers of monsters that crop up onscreen during many battles.  It's impressive that the game can display up to 30 or more enemies on screen at the same time, tracking each one's special attacks, fallen status and possible loot released upon death.  The flip side to this is that the game will often chug through these sequences until enough monsters have been killed to bring the frame rate back up to normal.  The other problem is that the game doesn't always understand the string of button presses that you throw at it, so pulling off charge attacks or special attacks in the midst of battle can be hit or miss.  In fact, some weapons will disregard that you've completed a combo, and will only recognize a special attack if you trigger the move in the middle of an animation swing.  Issues like this can definitely hamper play.   That doesn't really help when you consider that combat plays a huge role within the game, whether you're taking on monsters in the field, entering an ancient arena or testing your skills in Prisons of Rock or Paths of Carnage, bonus areas that provide additional treasure and experience.  In fact, you'll often need to switch characters during quests just to ensure that Toma and Cyrille gain enough experience to be useful. Otherwise, the character that isn't being used will accumulate levels at a much slower rate and become fodder for any monsters around.  Since the difficulty level in the field quickly ramps up, this can lead to tons of frustrating restarts. This is especially true when you realize that the Geo-Fortress will get attacked randomly, and the character remaining in the castle is the only one that can defend against the waves of monsters attempting to destroy your keep.  If your defender is weak, your castle will fall and the game will end.   This is my boom spell...Just be careful of the slowdown. At least players will have the ability to train in the Geo-Fortress' internal training ground, which provides a little way for under-skilled characters to strengthen their stats and skills, giving them a better chance to survive quests and defensive battles. In fact, as the game progresses, you'll acquire various types of metal, which can be used to upgrade and strengthen the various features of the fortress.  Players can boost features such as the power of the fortress' cannons or the number of robots servicing the keep overall, defending it during invasion attempts.  Since there's a limited amount of metal to be found overall, there's a lot more strategy involved in choosing which sections of the castle you want to improve and which ones can go by the wayside.  This is especially true when you realize that there are some aspects of Fortress improvement that are helpful to your combat situation.  For example, by strengthening your radar, you can detect items, monsters and other information that you can use in the field to help you defeat enemies.   The Geo-Fortress is also where you'll buy, sell and upgrade your weapons, thanks to the various merchants that you'll collect along the way.  Additionally, this is where you'll improve your character's various Power and Secret Arts.  Finally, as you activate more functions of the castle, you'll have the ability to turn it into different kinds of structures, with offensive, defensive and reconnaissance configurations. However, there is a caveat to the overall Geo-Fortress system, which is that its reliance on metal can sometimes take so long that you aren't gaining the upgrades that you need or desire, which can trickle down to the rest of the gameplay.  For example, one benchmark that I noticed was after six chapters and over forty hours of play, I still hadn't found what I needed to unlock some of the stations of the Geo-Fortress.  While that definitely speaks to the length of play, it also is a bit dissuading to know that you can sink that much time and effort into the title and not really get anywhere.   With so many monsters, it's time to play,  Visually, Shining Force EXA is eye-catching, with an anime-inspired look that feels somewhat reminiscent of Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter with its colorful, almost cel-shaded mix of monsters, characters and environments.  There's a nice mix of creatures that you'll face off against also, ranging from giant spiders to flying beasts and golems made out of ice, so you should be kept somewhat on your toes as you hack your way through the numerous monsters in the game.  Camera work is surprisingly good and tracks onscreen action quite well, with the exception of the slowdown that I previously mentioned. Plus, the interspersed cutscenes are quite nice, and add to the overall development of certain plot points. Unfortunately, the sound work could use a lot of help.  With light exploring themes and tame, but pulsing combat beats in the background, the music isn't so bad.  Nor are some of the sound effects.  The voice acting, however, is HORRIBLE.  Just about ever single spoken line will make you wince.Shining Force EXA is decent in bursts: the Geo-Fortress system is engaging, the varied locations and monsters that you'll fight against are varied, and the game is quite long, which should provide a lot of exploration for action RPG fans.  However, some of the flaws to the combat system, as well as the limited feature development, prevent EXA from becoming a good or even great title.", "date": "Mar 22, 2007"}
