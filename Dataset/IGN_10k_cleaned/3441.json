It's been seven very long years since Master of Orion II, the turn-based, 4x space strategy game that set a standard for the industry.  There have been several attempts since then to raise the bar for this genre higher, with mixed but largely unsatisfactory results for those of us who value personality as much as ship customization, AI and game balance as much as graphics.  This is the point where I'm supposed to write, Fortunately, MOO3 has changed all that.  It delivers where the rest haven't.  And damn...!  I hate driving home a literary  clich (even with false license plates).  But the fact remains that MOO3 does deliver an experience that's easily more challenging, exciting, and detailed than any game in the 4x space genre up to this time.  It has its share of problems, but they're really slim given the size of the project, and don't seriously affect gameplay once you get past the learning curve.The easiest way to reveal the richness of MOO3 is to take a step-by-step saunter through a new game session.  So let's do that, starting with some of your gameplay options.The Options ScreenThere are sixteen default races available to play in MOO3.  Each of them is rated for native ability in a host of matters that include several kinds of resource harvesting and battle skills, research, trade, diplomacy, etc.  Unlike MOO2, these races come with histories that are part of the back story, and will affect you whether you pay attention to the prefabricated stories enclosed with the manual, or not.  That's because individual races ~remember~ what's passed between themselves and their neighbors.  Silicoids are predisposed to like the Raas, which makes setting up deals between those races easier.  By contrast, the Cynoid species doesn't like the Imsaeis at all, and would just as soon see the latter pan-fried as engage them in any negotiations.Some races are more or less of a challenge than others, depending upon start-up conditions.  As you might expect from other strategy games, races that emphasize military might do very well in smaller galaxies, where their native advantages let them quickly close on unassuming adversaries.  Larger galaxies allow races with superior research capabilities to blossom.  Enjoy spying?  Humans and Evons are your races-du-jour.  Unfortunately, once you've chosen your race and entered a game, there's no way to see your race's attribute ratings, again.The extreme advantages that made several MOO2 races into caricatures have vanished from MOO3.  You won't find any races with the Creative trait, which allowed them, under MOO2 rules, to research two-to-three times the number of technology advances as everybody else, and in the same time span.  Nor can you give a race all sorts of advantages, and just take a loss to ~winning points~ at the end in compensation.  If you configure your own race in MOO3, you have to balance out positively and negatively rated traits before you can play.  The only way you can directly affect the strength of your side versus all others is by choosing the game's difficulty level: easy, normal, hard or impossible. Note that if you like the selections you've made for starting your last game, you can duplicate them for a new one using the ~Quick Game~ option.  This not only keeps whatever customizations you've made to your last race, but also the galaxy size and shape, number of opponents, victory conditions, etc, that you've chosen.  It's a convenient, handy tool, useful if you end up sandwiched in a no-win situation between three neighbors that hate your pseudopods.We'll select one of the pre-designed races, the Psilons, for our illustrated game.  Their research and diplomatic skills are superb, which is really important because their resource harvesting and combat skills are on par with an ink blotter.  We've also chosen to have eight opponents and a huge, three-armed galaxy with an average number of random events, and a few short starlanes,  More about what this all means in due course, citizen, as we move towards our appointed destiny as Sole Rulers of the Galaxy.The Galaxy and Solar System MapsWe start on the galaxy map, viewing our home star at a distance.  As it happens, we're in one of the more isolated galaxy arms rather than at the core, so we don't see the New Orion star system.  If we did, that would mean we were in the Orion Senate, probably with several other races.The Senate has its initial advantages, since you can create sundry diplomatic deals with your neighbors.  Of course, things might get unpleasant if they're the kind of neighbors who throw grenades into your house at two in the morning, which is why a race of unprepossessing geeks like the Psilon frequently do better in the early game if they're on their nefarious own.You'll immediately notice a pair of starlanes.  These are new to MOO3, and the quickest way by far to get between one star and another.  Travel otherwise can take several dozen to hundreds of turns to a supposedly nearby location: it's the difference between a four-lane, interstellar Autobahn and a cow trail.  We begin with two scout ships and a colony ship, so we'll send the two scouts out along the starlanes and see what planets are available at the neighboring star systems for the picking.Meanwhile, when we double-click on our star, it expands into a closer image, revealing all its planets and their satellites conveniently lined up in rows.  Clicking on a specific planet brings up a series of its most important statistics, including its fertility and mining resources, size, gravity, etc.  To make the data easier to assimilate, MOO3 employs a color-coded system based on the ideal environment for your race.  Planets identified as Green are good matches for your people, while Yellow planets are really a stretch, and Red planets are truly hostile to your species.  This system works on several levels, but the most obvious is colonization: a green planet can be colonized by one colony ship, a yellow requires two (or one with a long wait for population growth), while a red planet takes four.   The Planetary MapsIf we double-click on our home planet, we zoom in again.  This time, we're given a fairly large, slowly rotating planetary image silhouetted against a black background, with a host of data.  We'll be spending a lot of time, at least early in the game, on these planetary maps.  Unlike other 4x space strategy games, you're not limited to building structures on planets; you can develop different planetary regions (the number depends upon the planet's size) to suit your specific needs.  In addition, different regions have randomly varying fertility and topological conditions that make them more suitable for mining, farming, or other activities.If you click on the Planetary Infrastructure tab, you'll be able to examine each region, and look in detail at the structures you can place in each.  (Don't expect 3D, scrolling regional images.  What you get are relatively attractive lists with symbols.  MOO3 won't graphically wow you, but every visual at least lives up to its intended purpose.)  These are called DEAs, Dominant Economic Activities.  There are seven in number: Bioharvesting, Mining, Industry, Research, Government, Military, and Recreation.  Two can fit in any given region, plus a few incidentals you'll acquire through research.  All DEAs consume and produce resources.  Industry requires ore, for instance, and produces ships and buildings.But DEAs aren't the only thing to examine on your planet.  You've also got two building queues for military (ships, construction bays, ground troops, etc) and planetary structures, taxes to set, and funding levels to determine economic development, research development, and terraforming.  You can see how much unrest exists on this planetary colony, and why, and the disposition of all the military forces surrounding that sweet little planet of yours.  There are figures for GNP, income, production, maintenance, pollution, etc.Yes, it is a lot of information to absorb, and will take time to fully comprehend.  The in-game tutorial is too slim to help out, and the manual misses key sections of the game.  But the interface isn't too difficult to understand provided it's approached with common sense and a willingness to experiment.  Take pollution, for example.  By fiddling around with the funding controls and watching the figures, you'll quickly discover that the harder you push your citizens, the less efficiently they'll work (the funding slider changes from green to yellow to red), and the more pollution enters the atmosphere, driving up unrest.  You can watch the way projected production figures slow their growth as you wield the whip.  (Figuratively speaking, of course.  There are no Leather Goddesses of Phobos in this game.)Interestingly enough, something is already being built on our planet, and we're not even doing it.  If you click on the Planetary Infrastructure tab, you'll discover that DEAs are being created without our active participation.  We can remove these DEAs and put our own in their place; next turn, ours will remain, and the other ones will be back in queue.The culprit is an invisible planetary ~viceroy~ who is making these decisions: part of a larger game system in MOO3 that was mostly removed early last year, to narrow the product's focus.  Given the sheer complexity of MOO3, this piece of the original game plan was left in (as well as a few other pieces we'll discuss, later), because it was felt that the AI for it operated well.And so it does.  The viceroy AI is the best I've seen at handling planetary micromanagement, leaving you free to concentrate on the bigger picture after your empire expands.  This is, after all, one of the main complaints players have about 4x space games: that you still have to direct the destiny of every single colony you own long after the list grew too long to repeat in a single breath, and while trying to juggle the tricky issues of fleet management, warfare, espionage, diplomacy, and bathroom breaks.However, I do question why I can't turn the blasted viceroys off, especially during my early empire years when I can afford to concentrate on planetary management.  If I want to take control of my DEAs and send a viceroy off for a nice holiday with the missus and their little stash of paisley-colored eggs, that should be my affair; after all, who is supposed to be the Evil, Power Mad Ruler, here?  More annoying still is the fact that only a viceroy can install some special technologies that your researchers discover.  These are DEA add-ons called FLUs (Forced Labor Units), such as Soil Enrichment and Deep Extraction Mining, which aren't considered planetary structures.However, you can at least affect viceroy-driven DEA and FLU growth, as we'll find when we jump to another screen.The Empire and Finance ScreensUnder the Development Plans tab, you can give your viceroys general instructions about what things to build, and in what order.  First, select one of nearly forty planetary classifications (Large, Mineral Rich, Besieged, Newly Conquered, etc).  Then, choose primary, secondary and tertiary areas of concentration, from a dozen types available (Military, Research, Farming, etc).  That's it: you've made a development plan.  When you return to a colonized planet and switch its planetary classification for which you've made a plan, the viceroy will follow your development orders.  If no plan's in place, he'll go it on his own. Note that there are two planetary classifications supported per planet.  This means that you can actually give each planetary viceroy six directives: a pair a piece of primary, secondary, and tertiary goals.  While this sounds great, an average world only has six regions, which translates into twelve DEAs.  We'll have to keep our development plans smaller and more focused for colony worlds of average or lower size.Overall, I like development plans.  Once you develop a trust of the viceroy AI, they're a really great method of streamlining orders to groups of planets.  And the broad selection of planet classifications means you'll never lack for an appropriate category in any given situation.The other main tab under Empire, Policies, has several empire-wide controls.  The most important of these is the Opressometer (I know, it sounds like a device for measuring the temperature of a caf latte) that lets you determine how much of a Big Brother you want your government to be.  Watch your people more closely, and you'll catch more enemy spies, but you'll also annoy the nine infernal circles of hell out of your people.  Back off, make them feel free, and spies everywhere will celebrate your enlightenment by stealing you blind.  Hey, that's what strategy is all about: choices and trade-offs.At the moment, our single planet represents our entire empire, but that won't always be the case.  There will come a time when we're drawing in revenues from empire-wide taxes, while each planet has its own GNP and costs.  To see how your empire's doing, you can jaunt over to the Finance Screen, where a simple profit-and-loss statement examines your revenues and expenditures on a grand scale.  You can also use your tax surplus to fill several fund pools for expensive line items: military spending, research, unrest, and planetary grants (for DEAs, planetary structures, etc).  The AI takes a look at which planets need your monies the most, and divides up the windfall accordingly.  Everything that isn't needed, goes back into the empire-wide kitty.  The screen lacks atmosphere, and we're never told the specific planets that are dipping into the till on any conceivable turn, but it does the job well.By the next turn, you're researchers will be ready to work.  Time to make them earn their salaries!   The Technology ScreenMOO3 follows its predecessor in spreading technologies across six different ~schools:~ Economies, Energy, Mathematics, Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Social Sciences.  But while you could conceivably learn most of the available technologies during a long game of MOO2, that won't be happening in MOO3.  The sheer number of advances has been made deliberately daunting, with some schools offering more than a hundred.  You'll be forced to develop a research strategy involving just two or three schools, whose advances suit both your race and your game plan.  Most of the FLU enhancements to farm and mining resources are found under Biological Sciences, for instance; so if you're really weak with a hoe or a pick, like our Psilons, you could do worse than throw some researchers in, here.  And to make things harder, a few of the better discoveries are tied to previous researches in other schools.  Do you want that really nifty Energy Pulsar Warhead, a 41st level Physical Sciences advancement?  No problem!  Just be sure you've already achieved forty levels in the Energy school, as well, or you'll be left with a big parade and nothing to celebrate.The percentage of research you devote to each school is controlled by a series of six relational sliders, each of which can be locked or left open.  While it's an excellent design, I found the sliders acted occasionally as though they were all locked when they weren't.  Fortunately, a quick tap to lock and then unlock them again unstuck the things, and solved the problem.Another research oddity turns out to be a feature, rather than a bug.  If we leave the Technology screen alone for two or three turns, then return, we'll find that several disciplines previously set to no funding at all are now at 1-3%.  This gives a whole new meaning to the anti-behaviorist phrase, ~ghost in the machine.~However, the culprits aren't intergalactic ectoplasm, but those planetary viceroys of ours.  This is how it works: let's assume that a viceroy notes that there's not enough ore on its planet for industrial use, and that your empire is also strapped for the stuff.  It hasn't got room for any more Mining DEAs, so it sends along a request to your researchers and asks for assistance.  Those researchers in turn scan down the list of future discoveries that they can see (about five levels ahead), for one that will improve mining or reduce the need for it.  ~Mein Gott,~ shouts your chief researcher, using a phony Austrian professorial accent.  ~Deep Extraction Mining is right there, visible under Physical Sciences.  Let's go for that.~  Your research team then nudges that support bar up slightly, just a percentage point or two.  However, if a raft of viceroys send in the same request, you'll see the support bar shift dramatically.It's a really neat idea, when you think about it.  The AI is mimicking human behavior by having different aspects of your empire communicate with and modify one another.  This almost makes it feel as though we're dealing with a sort of Galactic SimCity.  Unfortunately, there's no word about this in the manual or the read-me file, and no explanation within the game's Encyclopedia screen.  (The Encyclopedia is good at what it covers, but far too little is really in there.)  Too bad Quicksilver never added a screen with a Head Researcher telling you something to the effect of ~We've had four requests for harvest improvements over the last week, so we've shifted X% of funding out of Y, and over into Z.  We hope you don't mind, your Benign, All-Seeing Grace, upon the effulgent bottom of whose radiant shoe I am merely a speck of cosmic bubblegum.~The Technology screen visuals leave something to be desired, as well.  MOO2 gave us a rotating holographic image of a discovered item, or what that item represented, along with a description, and a researcher standing nearby.  The image is gone, removing the discovery's tangibility, and the researcher's missing, so we lose the ~feeling of someone personally working for us.  What we're left with is a description of the advancement, in a small, squashed, hard-to-read font.  (It's also used in the Encyclopedia screen, more's the pity.)  As menus go, the Technology screen gets the job done efficiently, but I can't help thinking that it could all have been made more celebratory, weighted towards pointing out the most important advances, and a little easier on the eyes.We're going to fast-forward a few turns, now, just to let the scouts discover a couple of systems and the researchers do the voodoo they all do so well.  Each new turn starts off with a Situation Report, so that's what we'll examine, next.The Sitrep ScreenThis is the screen that notifies you of important events throughout your empire.  Here you'll find listings of new technologies and star systems you've uncovered, diplomatic responses, spy activity, etc.  I really enjoy the fact that most of the items are hotlinked, letting you immediately jump to the relevant screen for details; still, I dislike the bland uniformity of the Sitrep, itself.  At least you can always go back to the Sitrep by hitting the spacebar so you don't miss anything important by checking out a few entries.  Except, that is, when you reload a game.  MOO3 doesn't save the Sitrep when you quit, leaving you to scour all your empire's activities for details of what happened over your last turn---or take notes before you leave the game.  What's more, the game only saves data from your last turn, so that if you make changes to your empire in the current turn, save and close down, the changes won't be there when you load the game, later.  A nuisance, this.The Sitrep is also the place to go for information about random events that can hit any player at any time.  That they still need tweaking is obvious from the first random event our Psilons receive, about a wandering troop of performers who lower unrest on a specific colony of mine.  Since there was no unrest there to begin with, they didn't lower anything.  I've also received a random event in another MOO3 session claiming that my translation units had problems, causing a worsening of diplomatic relations with the last race I've spoken to.  At the time, my race hadn't encountered any others.Gotta go, now.  Speaking of diplomatic relations, ithe Sitrep has notified me of an incoming diplomatic message.  Our Psilons' splendid isolation is not so complete, any longer.   The Foreign Office ScreenLook at that: we just received a message from the Galirira, a group of Eoladi belonging to the Etherean species.  As their ambassador in the Diplomacy tab shows, they're primarily notable for the aesthetic quality of their pulsating, pastel-tinged wallpaper.  The animations, sound and graphics on this screen are actually very good, and each race (judging from others I've encountered in some literally exhaustive gaming sessions) is distinctive in all visual and auditory respects.  As far as game personality is concerned, this screen really delivers in spades.  It's too bad that their movements and voices don't cycle while the screen remains open, however.  There's little enough movement to watch, a few lines spoken, and then the image freezes silently for your response.If we jog over to the Foreign Matrix tab, we can see at a glance all the existing relationships between any races known to us.  In this case, only the Galirira shows up, and there are no prior arrangements.  By clicking on our visitors we can bring up a small panel that shows two figures: casus belli, and current relations.  The casus belli rating is a bit of a misnomer.  The phrase literally means ~causes for war,~ but MOO3's developers intends it in the sense of any prior relationships between our two races, positive or negative: it's a figure from minus two hundred to plus two hundred.  Current relations is self-explanatory.  No matter what your previous contact may have been, your current deeds can shift that.Clicking on the Galirira reveals that they're apathetic to our presence.  Since we're not a military power at this point, apathy is of the good.  Warlike rage would be a very bad thing.  Even floating creatures that look like they were drawn by Degas during the last stages of delirium tremens can fire weapons from very powerful ships, if they put their minds to it.So we'll try to get these guys on our side, at least for the time being.  (Sadly, there's no option to win MOO3 jointly, in full alliance with another race.  This was something Alpha Centauri did well.)  Let's start simple, by offering an economic treaty.  It will slowly build trust, and give us a bit of an economic boost.  We can really use the funds. We have other options available to us under the Diplomacy tab.  We could offer to exchange research, sign a non-aggression pact, send a gift, demand one, or exchange a wide range of items.  If things go well, we might try to secure a military or full alliance, assuming that alliance is probably worth the enemies it will bring.  On the darker side of the ledger, we could threaten, end agreements, impose sanctions/embargo, or declare war.  We can give or receive tribute.  We can also choose the tone in which we send messages.  There are seven different approaches we can adopt: plead, beg, reason, state, argue, declare, and demand.  There are no real linguistic subtleties involved, here; it's simply a matter of finding out the one or two emotional responses that each race prefers.  All Eoladi prefer comments couched in reasonable tones, so ~reason,~ it is.  Jumping ahead a turn, we're pleased to receive the Galirira's acceptance of our trade deal.  And as we move on a couple of more turns, we begin to see both the casus belli and current relationship ratings inch upwards.  Meanwhile, we'll propose a non-aggression treaty, just to see how they react to our feeler.While they're considering their reply, let me tell you in confidence that I've played through several MOO3 games and worked through diplomacy with different races.  It has to be said that Quicksilver has done a superlative job in building a sense of distinctive intelligence for each, less dependent upon a fixed characteristic than on a complex mix of independent goals, strengths, weaknesses, and perceptions about the rest of the universe.  The AI here isn't quite as devious and nasty as human intelligence, but it has yet to leave me wondering at insane or stupid decisions.In the meantime, several turns have passed in silence.  The Galirira are ignoring our last offer.  It's not a very friendly response, but the non-aggression pact was a pretty outrageous suggestion to make at this stage in our relationship.  Perhaps we should have sent them a gift, such as those pictures conclusively proving that the rumored Harvester race is actually an engineered army of Jerry Lewis clones.  Ah, well.  Had our association been stronger but the offer still not tempting, the Galirira might have responded using the new Stall tactic.  This would have let us know that they were hoping for a better deal.  Then we could have suggested the non-aggression pact and thrown in the Jerry Lewis Harvester pictures to sweeten matters sufficiently.You can see (in one of the spectacular images we took of our Foreign Office) that the Orion Senate tab is dulled out.  That's because, although we've been contacted by Galirira, themselves in the Senate, that doesn't automatically confer Senate membership.And how do we know that the Galirira are members of the Senate?  Let's go to the Victory screen for that.   The Victory ScreenThe Overview tab gives us a brief analysis of the Galirira.  It tells us some basics about them: their species, power ranking, government type, allies, enemies, and rules of engagement.  The last is important.  It shows that the Galirira do not view us as a threat (not yet, at any rate), and will not fire if we happen to show up as the same stellar laundromat.  They have declared a ~Quiet Front~ where we are concerned.  We'll reciprocate.  We want to play nice.  The same informational listing tells us that our new friends belong to the Senate.  Note that while they can propose us for membership, the ultimate word on that and everything in the early stages of the game belongs to the New Orions.The other tab in the Victory Screen focuses on how far along you are to fulfilling your game's victory conditions.  Depending upon the conditions you originally accepted, these could be Sole Survivor, Senate President, and the discovery and claim of Antaran data caches, lost on five unknown worlds.Now that we've looked at the Victory conditions, let's momentarily freeze our Psilon game and enter another one, where we begin as members of the Senate.  The Foreign Office: Orion Senate tabThe relative power of the New Orions and everybody else in the early stages of play is easily observed when it comes to votes:  more than a thousand for the New Orions, slightly over ten for each attending race.  This means that whatever bill (and there are dozens of kinds) the New Orions sponsor will get passed if it at least acquires a second.  While you can choose to ignore the resultant laws, you do so at the risk of being declared in breach of Senate policy.  That could result in an announcement of war from every other Senate member.  Moral: it's better to conform, then end up as an archaeological ruin in someone else's empire.You can't fault Quicksilver on lack of informational thoroughness in this screen, here or elsewhere.  You can click on any law and see who proposed it, all the attached conditions, how each member voted and how much their vote counted.  It can be used to provide clues of each civilization sees itself and its winning strategy.  For instance, if a Senate member opposes a bill sharply increasing unrest from the use of biological weapons, you know that their research team is not simply engaged in finding the final value of Pi.  They've got a nice cache of biological toys to share, and you can plan your own defense accordingly.I dislike the New Orions from an opposing player's perspective.  Who would feel otherwise, when you're outgunned, outvoted, and completely ignored by a far more impressive power?  But as a reviewer, I truly relish their presence.  They provide a fascinating early-game irritant, passing or killing whatever bills they wish, and a strong late-game interest, growing more aggressive as the ~lesser~ races survive to eventually become threats.  You can even challenge them for the Presidency of the Senate, one of the optional victory conditions already mentioned.  They're a more flexible enemy than the kind you'll usually find in these games, existing simply as military bullies having bad hair days.But back to our Psilons.  While it's true we're slowly building friendly relations with the Galirira, I wouldn't put it past the Impressionistic floaters to spy on our budding empire.  We'll save ourselves a lot of trouble in the long run if we work to stop any insidious infiltrations, now.  And while we're at it, we'll send out a spy or three to the Galirira.  Just to keep them honest, you understand.The Personnel ScreenMOO3 allows you to create spies tailored for six different missions: military, political, economic, social, diplomatic, and scientific.  These run the gamut of activities through technology theft, leader assassination, increased social unrest, etc.  (Spies can also be kept at home,  in which case they help to locate the spies of other empires in your midst.)  Each spy is rated in turn for four attributes: cloak (remaining undetected), dagger (ability to perform a specific covert action), luck, and loyalty.  These ratings are increased via technological advances in several research schools, and successes in the field.  Alternatively, if a spy repeatedly fails at missions, their attributes, especially loyalty, could decrease.  They may even resign (presumably to take up a quieter but no less nefarious line of work, like real estate sales or telemarketing).Under the right conditions, spies can redirect suspicion for their activities to third parties.  Spies that are demoralized and captured may even turn their coats and act as double agents.  Neither of these facts is mentioned in the accompanying game materials, though they clearly add further depth to an already rich product.My only criticism of the spying system is its lack of a personalized quality.  There's no real sense of tension, of risks taken and encoded messages sent on special frequencies; merely a brief, bland line or two stating a success or failure on your Sitrep screen.  The other tab under Personnel brings up the Leaders screen.  Here, you can hire up to four leaders.  Each brings at least one advantage, and possibly a disadvantage, as well, to your side.  Their arrival is more or less randomized, though if you colonize a planet possessing a small labor force from a non-player race, leaders of that race will be inclined to offer their services.  In another game, I occupied a world whose special was a colony of friendly Bulrathi, one of the non-player races decimated by the New Orions before MOO3 began.  (I'm not going to give you anymore of the back story than that.  You can read the details in the manual.)  Soon thereafter, a Bulrathi leader approached my people with offers of increasing their military prowess.But the first leader to show up on our Psilons' planetary doorstep is named ~Tiades of Philosophy.~  He's another Psilon, and as expected, improves research.  Since the improvement is based on a percentage of the research you're already doing rather than a fixed number, we're not about to turn him down.  Alas, his strong-arm methods with the civilian population (so we're told in his short bio) aren't appreciated, and he causes minor unrest on each colony.  We'll live with it.  Maybe another leader will appear who quiets unrest.  And hey, he's free.But now our empire is growing.  We're going to let it grow a lot at this point, then visit the Psilons again when they run into the Meklar.   The Shipyards, Space and Ground Combat ScreensIt was bound to happen, after all.  Sooner or later, our Psilons were going to encounter some race that had a long memory and a condo-sized chip on their shoulder.  In this case, it's the Meklar, and we're about to let slip the cybernetic dogs of war.While starter ships are provided for a number of specific purposes, you'll want to customize your later ships as new weapons, defenses, engines and specials are researched.  This is one of the strengths of the MOO series, its build-your-own design.  And since our Psilons are researchers above all, they can offer us the means to build the ships of our dreams, with the most advanced cannons, beam weapons, missiles, shields, etc.  The Ship Design tab in the Shipyards Screen is extremely easy to use, with all the information we need available and clearly labeled.While MOO3 battles continue to take place in two dimensions, they occur in realtime.  It's not as tough as it sounds, fortunately.  Combat takes place slowly, in stages, with planning and execution.  What's more, you're not in charge of individual ships, which can quickly become a tactical nightmare.  Instead, MOO3 uses fleets in battle.  War fleets in turn are built out of task forces, and task forces out of individual ships.  Ships fulfill specific purposes in any task force, while each task force in turn has its own larger purpose.  For instance, you might create a task force for long range attacks, containing ships that provide enormous fire power surrounded by others fitted with the thickest armor as interceptors.  (Given the limited volume of each ship, even the largest ones, specialization is an important part of winning conflicts.)  As for the battle, suffice to say that our superior task force and ship numbers paid off against the native military prowess and single-minded bludgeoning of the Meklar.  Our enemies, faced with multiple attacks from short and long range task forces, had their accuracy and damage bonuses negated because of divided concentration.  Much of our fire went uncontested, so the bonuses were ours.  After that, it was a matter of technology, in which our Psilons were ahead, and the strategic maneuvering of ships.  As admiral, I only needed to give each task force the most elementary of commands.  The grand picture was mine.  The ship AI was truly competent enough to handle the rest. What did you think of Master of Orion III? As with space battles, so with ground combat, though your range of commands is greater.  You build formations out of individual soldiers and support units on a given planet in advance, then send them into battle.  You can select from a lot of factors influencing the outcome: intensity, collateral damage, flanking, spread defenses, attrition, probes, sweeps, etc.  Nor must we forget planetary bombardment.  Have I already pointed out that this is a really rich game?Im sure there are going to be reviewers who take a look at MOO3 and scoff at the apparent lack of entirely new features, and complain that its more of a MOO2 update than a whole game.  What they may forget is that many of MOO3s innovative features were never solid in previous turn-based space strategy games.  Diplomatic AI has never been anywhere near as clever as in MOO3, for instance.  Combat has never been so strategically focused.  Colony development has never been so detailed and intensive, and computer opponents so well-balanced that literally any of them could win.  Galaxies are much bigger, available researches are more extensive, and theres far more information to track than in any previous 4x space game.  Yet the game doesnt play like some simplistically designed product that offers a super-abundance of what you originally liked, until youre sick of it.  Despite MOO3s complexity, Ive actually found it a more absorbing game than either of its predecessors.  (And thats despite giving MOO2 a high review rating in 1996, and periodically keeping it on my computer for months at a time, ever since then.)  Gameplay is a bit tough and slow at first, but that feeling only lasts until you get the hang of the interface.  Theres plenty to attend to on the planetary front in the early playing stages, while the addition of excellent planetary management AI and empire-wide financial polices and funding pools have removed the tedium that usually besets 4x space strategy games in the endgame.  In between, there are a host of winnable strategies to pursue, leading to a sky-high replayability factor.  My criticisms expressed in this review should be placed in perspective against this achievement.  Quicksilver has really pushed the envelope with this title in several distinctive though unspectacular ways, and in the process developed one of the most compelling strategy games Ive played in years.", "date": "Feb 14, 2003"}
