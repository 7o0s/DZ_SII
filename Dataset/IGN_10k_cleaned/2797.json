When I purchase an expansion for a title I expect it to expand my gaming experience. Because of this, I've always found Microsoft's half expansions for MechWarrior 4 (the $13 Mech Packs) to be a little suspicious.  They say cheaper add-on. I say a patch in a box that still costs money. I was right.  MechWarrior is a beautiful, deep, sci-fi action simulation. Everything about the series enthralls me. From premise to delivery, the games have never managed to disappoint. And now I get this, something I should have been able to download from the official website completely free of charge. Let's go over what's here in my shiny retail patch, shall we?   Four new mechs: Dragon: This 60-ton heavy mech is prized by House Kurita top dogs. They use its 85kph top speed to keep away from the competition and lay out plenty of heavy gauss rounds and LRM10s. When it gets tight, it may be found that the AC5 and medium laser are of little help against larger opponents.  Highlander: 90 tons with a jump jet, the 67kph cruising Highlander is the signature assault mech of the Northwind Highlander mercenaries. Biggest of the four new mechs, the Highlander can not only rush and push over smaller mechs (or crush them with well controlled jumping), it can also devastate from afar (via its heavy and standard gauss rifles).  Zeus: Of classic Inner Sphere design, the Zeus was fan elected to be part of this Mech Pack's armory. Lethal at ranges, the 80 ton assault mech can stumble in close quarters. After the heavy gauss rifle and its dual LRM15 launchers have been depleted, it has only a large laser to rely on. That, coupled with a brisk, but limited 70kph running speed and no jump capability, make it limited to professionals.  Hunchback: This stocky mech, complete with its shoulder mounted auto cannon, is tougher than it looks. The little 50-ton thing can take a pounding. But that bit of distinction will be the first thing to go in a heated fight. With a top speed of 98kph, the hunchback can dart in and out of enemy ranks crippling them with hit and run tactics from its two LBX AC20s, medium lasers, and SRM6 launcher.  There are also two new parts and two new maps that come with the Inner Sphere Pack. The ballistic heavy gauss rifle is like its name says, a more powerful gauss rifle, but heavier and lacking range (four slots, 18 tons, 600m, eight second reload). The other piece of technology is a nifty little thing called the IFF Jammer. When activated, the jammer will trick enemy HUDs into thinking you are a neutral target.  And finally, the Inner Sphere add-on contains two new multiplayer maps. Coliseum is pretty self-explanatory (an enormous stadium is the ring and you and your mech are one of the gladiators).  In stark contrast, Gagetown is actually a tree laden area just outside the walled city of...Gagetown.  And that's it! For the first time in my entire illustrious IGN career, I have been able to completely describe everything single aspect of a game. Oh wait, I forgot... Inner Sphere Mech Pack also comes in a DVD case.   I'm not going to drone on about how good MechWarrior looks or why its large, colorful landscapes, articulated and fluid mechs, and vibrant particle effects are any good. Nor am I going to blab on about how the sound is still decent and cite examples like the mech thump, the gyro buzz, and the whoosh of missiles. All that can be saved for the MechWarrior 4 review, which says the same thing.  Instead, I'll' get right to the point, which also happens to be really close to the conclusion.  What's being boxed up here and released for some 10 - 15 dollars is normally included in a patch by other developers. In fact, some games don't even bother releasing the patch, they initially provide creation tools and then let the kids have at it themselves. Chew on this... Could id get away with releasing another expansion to Quake III  that was just four skins, two maps, one weapon, and one item, and then go and charge $13 for it? Of course not!   It seems to me that at one point in time, the Mech Packs were to be some sort of larger multiplayer-centric expansion for Vengeance. But then somewhere along the way someone realized that such an expansion would not be profitable, so they were diced up and later reconstituted into these minor packs. It must have been thought that the hardcore fan will buy all the packs, but the mass of people will still be likely to buy at least one of them.   That's the best I can figure anyway. I mean, the sweet sounding Mercenaries is just on the horizon and looks fantastic, and yet we get these...why? To milk the license and the customer? Vengeance should be allowed to rest.   What is included also isn't of exceptional quality. The mechs aren't the awesome ones from the games that you scream about when lost and swoon over when acquired. They don't come with perfect loadouts that make you content with the way they were born. They're just four more in the already large selection of controllable mechs. Faceless but not hated, Madcats and Thors will still no doubt be the name of the day, forcing the new to take a backseat (even after the expansion I still use my custom Bushwacker almost exclusively).   The weapon and item are similarly decent, but nothing amazing. Would you pay to get a Clan ER Pulse Laser and a new kind of sensor disruption? Again, the answer is a resounding nope.  What did you think of the Inner Sphere Mech Pack?  And there's even a few problems with it all. Firstly, the price is atrocious (even adding up both Clan and Sphere Packs in terms of price ($26) and content (jack) wouldn't equal a normal expansion or quality budget title. Secondly, I've seen prominent gaming websites legally offering the Coliseum and Gagetown maps for free download! That's $3.25 off the price right there! And finally, installing the Mech Pak on top of a version of Vengeance not yet patched or any kind of Black Knight, will most likely result in some kind of problem, I experienced one every single time.  I'll be honest (because everything else I say is a complete fabrication). When I began this review I had no idea what I was doing and even less of an idea of what I'd say. Imagine that, an IGN editor most teased for his verbose and often pedantic writing not knowing what to say. See, I love MechWarrior. Every chance I get, I boast the series as one of the best ever. I own all of the games (and even several iterations of each), am hotly anticipating Mercenaries and MW5, and I even picked up the PlayStation version simply because. Yet here I am, sorely disappointed and utterly confused as to how I could be in the position of rating a game that isn't even a game.This Mech Pack is just a small collection of things to attach to a bigger, livelier thing. Unfortunately, this collection does not add nearly enough to the whole to be worthwhile or to justify its price (any price). Furthermore, what little it does add is not anything of merit or greatness. I'm going to top this off with something I told Stephen earlier today when he was helping me sort some things out. ~For fifteen dollars I can buy Serious Sam. For twenty dollars I can buy a Starlancer, Crimson Skies, Metal Gear Action Pack. For free I can download hundreds of characters for Freedom Force, and soon likely just as many user created campaigns. Why would I want this?~Saving the son is the father. MechWarrior 4 is still a great, great game. But, only true Inner Sphere patriots need apply here, and then only if they are hardcore multiplayer pilots. Everyone else be like me and patiently wait for the killer looking Mercenaries.", "date": "Jul 16, 2002"}
