I always look forward to the next platformer coming down the pipeline, even though many consider the genre to be old and passe. Who cares, eh? If it's a good game, it's a good game. Spider is a somewhat peculiar game, even when not considering the premise. You're a nanotechnology scientist, working on linking biological and technological processes together. You've been experimenting on a cybernetic tarantula, when a group of assailants attacks you violently. Before you pass out, you transfer your conscious entity into the spider. Spider the game is basically your trek to get your body back.  Apparently, Boss came up with the premise after they had already designed a large part of the game, which explains why it may seem a little thin. But beneath this, Spider is a 2D side-scrolling platform game at heart. You maneuver your spider through 30 plus levels of platforms, pipes, and old food cartons, both on flat ground and up walls, and even across ceilings. The spider itself moves realistically, and even appears to be motion captured (I'd hate to be the guy who had to put the sensors on the tarantula).  In fact, all the cybernetic insects, from bats to scorpions to slugs, move superbly.  Spider does look great, with some amazing textured backgrounds, such as the flowing lava. However, the control is a little strange, and takes some getting used to. To move up an incline or wall, you must press Up on the D-pad at the point the wall starts. It's an awkward transition that doesn't fit with your natural inclination to just keep pressing right or left. The best way to properly control the spider is to roll your thumb up or down on the D-pad.   Like last year's Pandemonium, Spider is track-based, but does offer multiple path branches. And, like Pandemonium, the floating camera stays trained on you when you go around track curves and such. It looks good, but the track can feel confining, especially when you think about the fact that it would be easier to just walk straight up that background wall, instead of dealing with all these pesky platforms. But that would sort of ruin the point of the game, wouldn't it?  Spider is an ultimately decent platform game, but lacks in real excitement. Even Pandemonium, which many considered sophomoric in its attempts at ~3D,~ had bright colors and silly, hopping baddies. And while Spider's cybernetic bugs are cool, after the initial excitement of watching slugs explode wears off, you're left with a rather dry action game.", "date": "Feb 14, 1997"}
