But after seeing the effect of the Madden series on the casual gamer's pocketbook, I'm not the slightest bit afraid to tell you that without EA Sports, the console race would have been drastically different for kids on team PlayStation. So, with the Dreamcast on gaming's doorstep, I'd have to say I'm looking at sports games with a bit more interest than the last go-round of the console wars.  But it's not as cut and dry as it has been in the past.   Thanks to some bum moves by the Egos at EA, there will be no Madden on the Dreamcast...at least not this year.  So of course, not wanting to lose that audience, Sega was then forced to come up with an adequate answer to this storied series. And what was their answer? Well, all we were left was an opinionated, lanky perfectionist claiming that a team of relatively inexperienced developers was going to come in and make a game from scratch, and that this title was going to leave every other game in the genre looking like a rookie DB on Jerry Rice.  Yeah Right.  Keep dreaming guys...  I mean, the E3 showing looked impressive.  No doubt about that.  But could these guys play?  Not exactly the safest bet in town. So, I popped in NFL2K and prepared to be wowed graphically by a game that showed why Madden would always be king in the gameplay department. I mean, let's face it.  No amount of motion capturing can make up for a lousy game, and these guys just don't have the experience, ya know?  Leave it to Visual Concepts to come along and once again remind me why I wish shoes tasted a little more like chicken....   After a few seasons of madness, I can honestly say that, regardless of what you may read on the newsgroups or in other ~publications,~ NFL2K is the most impressive gridiron effort ever created in every sense imaginable.  Period point blank.  It completely thrashes the competition, and will have you laughing in disbelief that you ever managed to stomach older efforts.  So, after a statement like that, I'm sure you expect me to back it up.  Well, hope your ready for the flood of ooze, kiddies, 'cause here it comes.  As much as I'd love to tell you how #$%@# good this game looks, I'll cut to the chase and fill the hardcore sports addicts on what really counts: gameplay.  Does NFL2K have the goods?  Oh, hell yes.  Not only does this game manage to move like a sprite based classic in full polygonal glory, but everything, right down to the way you can force a receiver to cut back and go over the secondary to come down with the big play is near-spotless.  Never before has a game been so realistic in its ability to convey how a game of football actually feels, and never before has a game demanded so much of its users to actually succeed on the field, both of which combine for one of the most incredible sports titles we have ever played.      First off, know that though you can realistically jump right into a game of NFL2K thanks to the rookie mode and VC's QuickStart option, but that this doesn't even scratch the surface of what the game is all about.  The rookie mode is the perfect answer for the casual gamer, with a greater emphasis on big plays, big hits, and a fast pace.  Football veterans will no doubt find this level way too easy, but for those of you who aren't fans of the sport but can't help but be tempted to give it a go due to the amazing visuals, this mode should fit like a glove.  Think of it as Blitz on a sedative with a full team on the field.  Up the difficulty to Pro, and you will see an instant transformation from an arcade style SportsTalk '95-esque title to the most demanding football experience we have ever played.   The tricky thing is how to put this in to words.  I guess the best place to start is to say that you have to understand that, because of the heightened sense of realism, this is the first football title that really has to take more than player movement into account in terms of gameplay.  Not only do you have to be very active on the controller to make the big plays, but it's almost as if you can feel the quarterback break your fall with Seau, the exhilaration of making that diving catch in the end zone under double coverage with Moore, the frustration in the empty hands of a d-line trying to put the stop on Anderson.  Instead of a held down turbo button, you actually have to tap the ~a~ button to use breaking speed.  Not only does this make you work for that boost, but it allows for a seriously realistic pace change-up unseen in any grid-iron effort before it.  Forget a juke button, you want to give some guy the shivers, it's all up to you.  The same goes for passing.  Thanks to Maximum Passing which, not unlike Acclaim's QBC, allows you to intentionally guide the ball in any given direction in the general area of the receiver (meaning you can choose to overthrow, underthrow, or horizontally lead the receiver in any given direction view the analog stick during the pass itself), you can really stretch the limits of your players.   You can also choose to charge up your moves with or without the ball, such as stiff arms, swim moves, and hurdles, at which point you'll really put that extra ~umph~ into the move you select.  Passing is also handled much better than efforts past, as you don't have to ~call up~ passing icons...they just pop up once you are in a position to throw the ball.  By the same token, receiving the ball has also gotten a good kick in the head in terms of realism.  You now have to worry about things like positioning and *GASP* timing to catch the football.  And I don't mean tapping a button and being on the star.  Oh no.  This IS football.  You have to make sure you're lined up to either catch it in stride or facing the ball, and you also have to get your player in line to make the play.  You won't see defenders in the way just sort of look at the play.  They go after the pigskin, and when you're on defense, you'd best be prepared to bat the ball out of the air, because receivers make a continued, active effort towards reeling the ball in on every play.   It's little things like this that bring up the most interesting issues found in N FL2K.  This game is so real, you just run in to things that have never even been issues in older football titles.  As good as Madden was, you never really had to worry about positioning, or varying formations, or using players stylistically.  A good running back was usually just a good back.  In NFL2K, you actually have to try and play like each individual player.  If you're the Vikings, don't expect Smith to steam roll anyone.  He is at his best when he lets the line lead the way straight up the field, and the same is true in the game.  I can't tell you how it feels to be on the d-line with Randle, knowing that Terrell is coming. Again. And again.  By the end of the game I really hated that bastard, but at the same time, I loved the challenge he presented.  Big bruising backs are such a bitch to bring down, and if you have a weak run defense, you'll have to totally focus if you hope to keep the opposition out of the end zone.  Like no game before it, NFL2K has really captured the essence of franchise players, and due to its impressive level of detail, has so encapsulated the feel of football that you'll sweat every single down.  I swear I'll never forget my 4th quarter showdown with Brett and Co...intense.       It's the type of game that actually forces you to really play football. You can not play like a dumbass.  This means no linebackers on deep route receivers.  This means no running up the gut on a stacked 3-4.  This means no power-running with Napoleon Kaufman. You can't get away with mismatches.  If isn't Deion, Woodson, or triple coverage, chances are Moss will burn you all day. You can't choose one defense/offense and not get eaten alive, and you simply can not play lazy.  This game means business, and if you get good enough to graduate to all-pro, you will know what a challenge is.  Trust me on that.  This is not a simple ~run to the outside,~ bomb to the ~speedy receiver~ money-play AI we've all seen in the past, and it actually learns, and much like a human opponent, will anticipate play selection based on mere formations, and will often misjudge if you mix up your plays enough, which is a plus, as it allows you to pull off things like play action and end arounds against the CPU, which is pretty friggin' amazing for video game football.  It is the type of experience that teaches you exactly how to get things done, and expects you to learn from your mistakes in order to move the ball up the field.  It may seem like a minor thing, or maybe even an annoyance to those who don't really know football, but after getting into things, it is the type of experience that will make you more than a fan...you'll be a student.  This in an of itself is pretty impressive in my book.     From a control standpoint, the game manages to get nearly everything right from square one, though my only real knocks on the game come in this department.  As far as running, catching, pass defending and kicking go, I am in love with NFL2K.  Running offers a wealth of options, and will require a lot of you as a player, and you will find that your hands are worn out from button mashing by the end of the game, but one thing is for sure: you know you've earned your yardage.  The same goes for receiving and pass defending.  As I said before, it is very hands-on, and very demanding.  But it's not all roses.  My primary issue with NFL2K comes in when attempting to gain control of a defensive player.  Typically speaking, football titles have given you the player closest to the offensive man whose in a position to make the play.  Oftentimes in 2K, however, it seems you'll get the player closest to the ball, meaning that if it has just left the QB's hand and is on its way over the d-line, you'll get stuck with some random guy who is nowhere near the two cornerbacks closing in on the receiver, and to put it bluntly, you get screwed, hardcore.  I don't know how may times I got charged with a late hit or gained control of a player who is on the opposite side of the playable angle of the ball, as opposed to the defender standing directly on the initial catch circle.  Obviously, you can't expect a game to read your mind in this sense, but at this point, I certainly expect it to give me someone who would logically make the play.  Oftentimes, I found myself getting a guy who was either off-screen or a good five yards off the ball when there was a DB right next to the play, and it drove me nuts.  Thing is, this is only really a problem in two-player.  The same thing is true of the running game.  For some reason, it seems as if tackling is much easier for human players, and shoestrings are a common sight on even the toughest fullback, which drives me nuts.  I've heard ~you have to hurdle,~ but let's face it.  You don't see a guy like Alstott worrying about playing leapfrog because some guys fingers are near his feet.  Hell no.  He just trucks through that guy like a semi.  Not so in multi-player, and it kinda pisses me off.  Rarely have I seen an effective ground campaign in a 2-player match of NFL2K, and I go for 100+ on a regular basis against the CPU, so I know its possible.  Additionally, the interaction between the offensive line and stronger defensive players seems a little off-balance, as depending on who you used, you could go through even the best lines (Minnesota's springs to mind  You'd swear Christy was a little woman and not a perennial pro-bowl starter), and conversely, you could never get through certain lines with some of the best in football. I hate to break it to ya, VC, but San Fran's line isn't all that.  Player balance is always tricky, and as I said before, this game does a better job than most, but I just wish it would have been a little less biased towards certain teams.  The thing is, these are pretty minor gripes in single player, as they somehow seem less prevalent, and to be honest, are problems every game faces.  Outside of that, I would have liked to see a spin move on defense, which if it exists still eludes me, and after playing Madden 2000, I must confess I like the juke move.  It'd be nice to have some sort of answer on that end.  Maybe next year, eh?  On to the options.  I know many of you would have loved a ~franchise~ mode, and are still bitching and moaning about the lack thereof, but let's be honest.  When it all comes down to it, would you rather have a game that plays intelligently, and one that plays smart, or one that allows for pre-formatted extended seasons?  Sorry, but for my money, I'd much rather have a game than an option, and as a result, I can't say I miss it too much.  Outside that, all the standards are there: weather that actually effects gameplay, create a player (Simply awesome.  The best ever!), create a team (very cool), multiple difficulty levels, difficulty equalizers (allows poor teams to keep up with the best so you can play your favorite city against your buddy from Chicago without any major discrepancies in talent), an excellent, informative tutorial mode, practice modes galore, create-a-play, Coach's pick play-calling, fantasy seasons, custom tournaments, full roster control, playoffs, a kitchen sink, and more.  There is more than enough to keep you busy, and certainly more than enough to keep a football fan tweaking and geeking.     This incredibly robust package is brought together by the best presentation ever seen in any sports game to date.  Incredible play-by-play with a host of announcers, a functional PA system, as ports ticker full of cool info and game scores, excellent sound effects, an intuitive play calling interface that is incredibly beneficial in single player (though somewhat suspect in multi-player if you don't learn how to bluff or use the VMU  though this aspect of the game is a little weak for my tastes), and oh yeah,  if I recall correctly, the game looks $%#&@$ AMAZING!!!  Awesome animations, killer player models that do a great job of representing different players, and a ton of variation really make NFL2K shine.  Imagine seeing Jerry Rice break long for that one handed catch.  Think of Brian Cox breaking through the line for a thunderous hit in the backfield.  It's all right here, and it has never looked this real.  You may have heard this thing could easily be mistaken for a television broadcast, but let me tell you that nothing prepares you for seeing this thing full screen, coming right off the hardware.  You will find yourself hard-pressed to put up with all other console iterations of football from a visual standpoint, and this will become a problem from the very first down.   If anything, the visuals in NFL2K are not its sole virtue, but rather indicative of the overall level of quality that permeates the entire experience of this masterful creation.  It would be be easy to sit back and nit-pick a game like this and try to convince myself that I didn't like it as much as a Madden or a Quarterback Club, but the bottom line is I'd just be lying to myself for the sake of preserving some nostalgic idealism that really has no place in a gaming review.  I went back and really tried to play the competition, and let me tell you.  You can forget it.  Even the mighty Madden 2000 felt like such a waste of time after this bad boy.  To put it bluntly, NFL2K easily crushes every concept you've ever had about what is good in video game football, and anyone who tells you different either failed to really play this game or has no clue what football is really about.  Never before has a game so accurately captured the experience of being on the field, and in fact, the game only real flaws come in to play because of the fact that it is so real, you notice little things that were never even an issue with gaming football in the past.  In the end, 2K's positives far outweigh a few minor gripes, making it the definitive football title on the market today.
