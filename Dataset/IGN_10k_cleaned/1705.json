I'm sure many of you have probably memorized the cast of characters in Guilty Gear X due to the amazing amount of hype and coverage everyone has been giving this title.  And GGX certainly deserves attention, with it's gorgeous character designs, wonderful animated characters, and over-the-top gameplay rivaling the insanity of Marvel Vs Capcom 2.  While Guilty Gear X has been garnering all the attention, being hailed by some people as the best-looking 2D fighting game ever, The Last Blade 2: Final Edition has hardly been noticed by anyone other than the most die-hard SNK fan.  And that's pretty sad because Last Blade 2: Final Edition for the import Dreamcast is a phenomenal title; while it might lack the wonderful visuals that make Guilty Gear X so awesome, Last Blade 2's strength lies in its strong gameplay mechanics, excellent character variety, and a deep assortment of fighting techniques.  And in many of those areas, it excels to become one of the best 2D fighting games around.  The biggest reason why most import gamers will slide away from Last Blade 2 is how graphically inferior this game is compared to Guilty Gear X.  Of course, LB2 is far from being a mediocre looking-game; although the visuals might be dated to some, I find the character designs, background settings, and animation still quite appealing even though LB2 came out in arcades more than a year ago.  The game takes place in the late 1800s, and there's the obligatory story of how the world is facing disaster as the spirits from another dimension invade the world today.  I'm giving you guys the reader's digest version because as good as a story is in a fighting game, it's just filler to introduce the diverse characters in the game.  I mean, come on... it's a FIGHTING GAME!   With 16 characters available from the start (and a few hidden ones including Musashi from the original The Last Blade), it's nice to see that characters costumes represent the contrasting traditional and modern styles of Japan in the 1800s.  You'll have your traditionally samurai-dressed characters (Moriya, Kojiro, Keiichiro), Euro-modern styled fighters (Kaede, Shinnosuke, Setsuna), and some that don't really fit in any category (Muroko, Shigen, Akari).  All characters animate pretty well, and while it's not on par with SNK's later efforts (i.e. Garou: Mark of the Wolves), it's still pleasing to the eye.  The overall graphics can be best described as a mix between Samurai Shodown and King of Fighters; while character models look quite human, there's crazy and often humorous visuals, especially when it comes to the special attacks (check out Akari's Dead Man's Party). The Last Blade 2: Final Edition might not win over players with its graphics but as said above, the game's biggest strength lies in it's excellent gameplay.  When starting a game, players have a choice between three different modes: Power, Speed, and EX.  Power obviously gives the player much more power to attacks, and also gives players two types of super attacks: desperation and super desperation attacks.  Speed mode provides the player with numerous combination options, and while Speed mode offers only one type of desperation attack, the player also has the Combo Special.  The Combo Special allows players to chain up several normal moves into a huge 10+ hitting combo; in a way, it's similar to Tekken's 10-hit strings though there are many different Combo Special patterns that do more damage or even knock up the opponent.  EX mode is a combination of both Speed and Power, offering the strengths of both modes, but also having a heavy penalty of taking more damage from an enemy's attack.  Each character can be played with equal skill in all modes, and this makes for quite a balanced fighting game.  Attacks are performed with three buttons: a weak attack (A button), a strong attack (B button), and a kick attack (X button).  The fourth button (Y button) executes the all-important counter technique; by pressing the counter button at the proper time, you can repel an attack leaving an opponent wide open.  Additionally, you can also counter special attacks and if this sounds overpowering, it's not.  Countering special attacks takes even greater precision in timing as there's a smaller ~window of opportunity~ when repelling special attacks as opposed to normal attacks.  Mastering the counter move makes the game so much more enjoyable and strategic, as tried and true 2D fighting tactics (i.e. fireball-uppercut strategy) are nullified since players can repel special attacks, even from the air!  There are few flaws that took away the enjoyment of Last Blade 2 though one of them has to be the music.  As a big fan of SNK tunes from Samurai Shodown and the King of Fighters series, LB2's music doesn't do it for me.  Most of the music centers around light flute melodies and violin concertos, and while it's quite pleasant, it doesn't really suit the mood for a fighting game.  Also, there's an annoying sound edit that occurs when you beat an opponent; the music will suddenly cut off in the middle a few seconds after you defeat an enemy.  There are some pretty cool extras that include hidden characters, an excellent art gallery, and a bonus Hanafuda card game.  With all the bonus modes and deep gameplay, it's kind of a shame that Last Blade 2: Final Edition is being overlooked; of the two import 2D fighting games that have come out during the holiday, Guilty Gear X has bathed in the glory of being the best looking 2D fighter.  I suppose that's understandable, since we're all visual creatures.  But after a week of Guilty Gear X, if you need something with a little more depth and technique, I think most of you will find The Last Blade 2: Final Edtion a worthy import fighting game that cuts a deeper gameplay edge.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC Last Blade is a good game in a crowded field, and while it does stack up with the best of them, it ends up falling short because it just doesn't have the same charm and familiar characters that the bigger names in SNK's NeoGeo Pocket line-up do. It may be one of the most accurate fighters, but most of its innovations have been siphoned into Gals Fighters (which also has jumped a few programming hurdles and offers a less letterboxed screen and the fastest fighting gameplay on the system). However, the cast of fighters is deep, the game is fun, and the Gallery may take your entire lifetime to complete (it's like an Easter Egg Hunt in Chickentopia). You can't go wrong with Last Blade, but you could go even more right with SNK vs. Capcom and Gals Fighters. If you're still hungry for fistcakes after those two, dig into Last Blade.", "date": "Jan 5, 2001"}
