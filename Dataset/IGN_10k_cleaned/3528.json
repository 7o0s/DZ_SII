The premise takes the formula of building and managing a theme park to the best of ones ability a bit further by replacing boring old roller coasters and bumper cars with dinosaurs. As every videogame fan knows, adding dinosaurs to any game concept can only help and in the case of JP:OG, it's true once again. In fact, the developers at Blue Tongue even optimized the controls for the console to the point where you may not even miss the keyboard and mouse. However, a premise that starts off very promising --there are dinosaurs for crying out loud!-- ends up a bit stale if you're only a casual fan of this type of game and disappointing if you're a dedicated god/management/strategy fan because there are several games on the PC that turn the trick better than this one.  Gameplay  Operation Genesis is the main game mode of JP where you get to build your own version of Jurassic Park amusement park and make it successful. There are missions and exercises separate from Operation Genesis that first teach you and the apply skills that you will need in that main theme park building mode.  For those unfamiliar with the genre, the idea is to use an overhead/god's perspective to build a theme park from scratch, choosing the buildings, where they're going to be placed and how much to charge. Games like Roller Coaster Tycoon proved to be popular among older gamers because of the micromanaging functions that allowed you to set the menu and prices of the park's fast food outlets, manage a custodial staff and handle security all for the purpose of running a profitable and popular amusement park business. In the case of Jurassic Park, you're not picking the rides or designing roller coasters, but creating every element of your dinosaur exhibits including the species of dino, their habitat and how people are going to experience them.  The combination of playing god and having the skill of a strategist do come together very nicely in Jurassic Park, at least early on. In a multi-tiered system and for every dinosaur you hope to have in your park you have to first excavate archaeological digs for fossils, research the genetic material until you have enough to hatch one of those suckers and then put the new dino in a habitat that will make it happy and healthy. Every single one of those components costs money and bigger and better dinos --which you can charge more to see-- cost bigger dollars.   The cash management aspect of the game is rich enough and in inline with what's expected from ~tycoon~ type games. To be successful, you have to charge and spend in the right balance. You can set how much you want to charge for entrance to the park, to use observation areas to see the dinos, for souvenirs, burgers and dogs and even the bathroom if you feel so inclined. But to keep the flow of customers you'll have to make sure you're meeting their needs and expectations. And the magic of games like this, that Jurassic Park also has, is that it's all trial and error. You won't know you're charging too much for burgers and fries until you read your customer reports or read the people individually and see what they have to say.   The level of strategy involved in managing your dinos is both a strength and weakness of Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis. Once you've done the work and paid for actually creating a dinosaur, presenting them in a cost efficient way is your next challenge. Protecting your patrons from vicious carnivores requires that you use a strong enough fence, but at the same time you have to give those T-Rex's something to chew on that they like to keep them happy and healthy so that people won't complain that your dinos are boring or sickly. Different dinosaurs have different likes and dislikes that you have to pay attention to and these go beyond what herbivores and carnivores like to eat. Some like to have plenty of their same species around them, some like to be alone, some like lots of trees, some like people, some like to eat some dinos but not others. It's great that there's that much to account for in creating your perfect eco-system, but this either requires a ton of reading the in-game Dinopedia, plenty of trial and error or an unhealthy amount of dinosaur knowledge.       You're not building your park in a vacuum however and you have a board of directors that want to see your profits rise no matter what. And ~no matter what~ includes ill-timed natural disasters which do damage to your park that has to be repaired and cost you revenue from the gate entrance and all your concessions since nobody wants to visit a disaster area. This kind of time and economic pressure, again, is good because it's accurate but it's just another part of a game system that's unintuitive at best and utterly confusing at worst. Those looking for a pick up and play good time will be frustrated by the user un-friendliness.  There are ~action~ sequences where you'll get to drive the JP Land Cruiser around your own custom Safari Adventure attraction taking pictures or fly a Ranger helicopter around the island to tranquilize rampaging dinosaurs or drop lures to get them to move to a certain location. You can't ride roller coasters in this one, so these elements are intended to get you in on the ground level of your park. The sniping skill from the helicopter and the Pokemon Snap skills of the Land Cruiser sequence aren't as engaging as they sound and don't offer the same kind of thrilling park feedback that riding your own roller coaster would give.   Graphics  The look of JP at glance isn't that impressive even though there are a handful of graphical details here and there that you will definitely appreciate. Overall, you're getting fairly bland textures and environments that do a good job suggesting trees, mountains and lush tropical locales, but there's absolutely nothing that will knock your socks off.  The camera in Operation Genesis is well done and shows off some of the cool details of the game. The zoom function allows you to seamlessly move from a super wide angle, where you can see several structures that make up your park, to an extremely tight shot locked onto an individual park patron and see their wardrobe and face. The people are very basic and made up of maybe two handfuls of polygons but being able to get that close to see how simple they are shows that some thought went into this console ~Tycoon~ game. I mean it's just fun being able to see the park nestled up against mountains and jungles and instantly zoom in on your park's hamburger stand being able to see the guy behind the counter helping customers that walk up. Sometimes you won't need a consumer report to know that lines are too long or a certain number of people are visiting different attractions.  The dinosaurs themselves don't look very dazzling but they're all animated with sophisticated believable moves. You'll be able to recognize a pack of raptors on the hunt by their gait or a triceratops frolicking with another in an open space. They move beautifully even if the models themselves aren't all that impressive with their washed out browns and earth tones.   Sound  There's not much to listen to in Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis, so all of the audio element are just decent. You get quick voice snippets from the park advisors complaining about or announcing one thing or another and the public address/secretary's voice are all well done.   Sound effects are limited to roaring and yelping dinos --when you're close enough to hear them-- vehicle sounds, and weather. We don't know if the dinos are making accurate noises, but they do sound very much like the dinos from the JP movies, so that's got to count for something.  You will learn to love the Jurassic Park theme music or you will go mad while playing this game. It's well orchestrated thanks to the developer's association with the Melbourne Symphony, but it comes up often enough that you will grow weary of listening to it. Ambient music during gameplay is likewise from the Melbourne Symphony and definitely seems inspired by the original movie's theme. Jurassic Park could be a real hoot for serious dinosaur enthusiasts but not necessarily for fans of the movies or ~tycoon~ game fans. I don't fall into any of those categories so I can honestly say that JP is good but not great and not really bad. As good as the control system is on Xbox, games like this just aren't as appealing on console. I wouldn't ask for more action because that's not what the game is about, but as it is, it doesn't do the genre well enough to be considered a must-have on Xbox.", "date": "Mar 25, 2003"}
