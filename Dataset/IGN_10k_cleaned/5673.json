{"name": "Midnight Pool", "name_review": "Midnight Pool", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/04/09/midnight-pool", "text": "is Gameloft's latest triumph. The studio has taken the simple game of pool, which has already been well represented in the mobile arena, and not only tightened the sport itself, but doused it with much-needed personality. The game takes place in a late-night pool hall, where a cast of eclectic characters has gathered to challenge each other to a little 8- and 9-ball.   Gameloft's Midnight Pool offers you a fairly deep level of customization, allowing you to effectively personalize the game to your liking. First, you can choose the rule set -- US 8 ball, UK 8 ball, or UK 9 ball. You can choose to challenge other characters directly, enter tournaments, or play trick shot contests. You can even choose the colors of the table. Once you've set up your particular contest, you enter what is easily the most in-depth pool game seen on mobile.   Setting up your shots is easy. Making them? Not so much. You do have the benefit of a sight guide -- a white line that shows you the path of the cue ball and a hint of the trajectory of the other balls around it. Now, this admittedly sounds like it would yank the challenge right out of the game, but considering the limitations of a mobile pool game (no 3D camera, strict top-down view), it's a necessity to make the game playable. After lining up your shot, you can opt to put a little spin on the ball. Set the power for your shot and then let 'er rip. The animation of the balls clacking about the table is smooth and satisfying.   Now, a solid pool game would be good enough for a lot of publishers. Not Gameloft. It's the infusion of personality that really pushes this game into the stratosphere. For one thing, all of the characters have their own unique style -- from their appearance to the comments they make before and after play. Jenny may coo at you, but don't let your guard down at all against her -- this sultry vixen will walk all over you if given half the chance. Other characters include Christopher the sheriff, Sarah the pool hall owner, and Richard the gambling man.   Now, when you fire up Midnight Pool, you may be caught off guard by the audio. Yes, that is indeed ~Sweet Home Alabama.~ Is it out of place? A little, but could this be the start of something new in mobile -- licensed soundtracks?   The game looks fantastic. We tested it on a LG VX7000. The table and balls were bright and crisp. Each player is represented by a portrait on each side of the table and the camera pans nicely from side to side depending on whose turn it is. Midnight Pool just has a remarkable look to it -- great atmosphere all around.Whatever is in the water at Gameloft must be bottled and sold to the wireless gaming development community. These cats have a magic touch that turns almost everything they touch into mobile gold. If you already have a pool game on your handset, delete it. Make room for Midnight Pool, and while you're at it, don't bother with buying a subscription. Purchase it outright, because this hustler is going to be on your handset for a long time.", "date": "Apr 9, 2005"}
