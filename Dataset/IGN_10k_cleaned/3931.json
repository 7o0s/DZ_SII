To that end, this year a host of new features has been added with the purpose of making NASCAR Thunder 2004 a better game, instead of just adding more of the same from previous years' versions.   The most notable addition to the console versions is ~Grudges and Alliances.~ The goal behind this feature is to finally deliver on the promise to make you feel like you're racing against flesh and blood human beings, and not just AI drones plodding along in circles for the duration of the race. The other goal was to make more honest drivers out of all of us, by making us pay for using other drivers as bumper cushions for us to bounce off instead of using discipline and skill to hold our racing lines.   Then there is Speedzone, the NFL Minicamp of NASCAR 2004.  You get various tasks at different levels of difficulty to complete, such as blocking when you have the lead, passing cars cleanly for points (and losing points for contact), etc.   Coming back this year are Thunder Plates, Career Mode, Season Mode, and Lightning Challenges.  And then add to this the first time ability to race online with a console NASCAR title, complete with microphone support, and you have a pretty comprehensive upgrade to last year's game, not just slightly better graphics and sound and new driver rosters.   Gameplay  First of all, for those who are expecting this title to break any new ground in realism for a console simulation, you won't find it here.  In fact, every gripe I had with last year's physics engine is still there.  The cars refuse to scrub off speed the way they should.  In real life, the wall of air you're plowing through, the engine braking effects and of course tire scrub all conspire to bleed off your speed fairly quickly during cornering.  Not here.   This means that instead of just lifting and feathering the throttle to get through the turns, you usually have to brake.  In some cases you will have to REALLY squeeze it, or you'll rocket into the corner too fast, fail to bleed off speed, and push up the track either into another car or the unforgiving wall.  Turning the driving aids off makes this even less realistic by making the car very prone to kicking you into massive oversteer, replete with tire smoke.  This is aimed at arcade console racers, not sim-heads, so I can forgive the compromise on realism, but the way this title is implemented actually makes it much, much harder to drive smooth consistent laps using a standard dual shock controller.  If we're supposed to ~race the track, not the pack~ then why is it so much easier to throttle steer around the turns in the sim-heavy PC version than it is in the ~arcade~ console version?  The quote above seems in many ways to apply more to the PC version than the console version as a result.   Which, I guess, puts Atari's (formerly Infogrames') NASCAR Heat and Dirt to Daytona titles will retain their reputation as being the most realistic of the console stock car titles.  When you go to the Thunder Plates section to do a lead-follow instructional session on a track, you'll find that the track guide narrated by Richard Petty does not quite match the colors of the racing line that show you whether and when to brake or accelerate.  This serves to illustrate the gulf between the techniques used in a 'real' NASCAR simulation (or real-life NASCAR) and the techniques used here for a particular track.   After spending a fair amount of time tweaking my car's setup to behave more realistically, I gave up and decided I would do some Thunder Plate challenges and just forget everything I know about the tracks from other simulations, and instead just do whatever was necessary to get the ~Legends~ plate for the best lap time.  At all but the restrictor plate tracks (Daytona and Talladega), you will need varying degrees of braking and lifting, and in some cases momentarily coasting, to make the corners without sliding up the track.     Even using the Dual Shock, you may actually prefer to use the X and O analog buttons for gas and brake instead of the right stick.  This is because you may think you are going full throttle, when in fact your analog stick may be slightly left or right of the 12 o'clock position.  In some games this doesn't matter much.  But when you need to be at full tilt running in close quarters with lots of other cars, you darn well need to know that you are in fact running at full throttle.   If you liked the way the cars handled last year, you'll be fine with it this year.  If you wanted something more akin to the simulation you'll find on the PC, you'll be disappointed.  You'll find that once you hit the short tracks, just keeping your car on the correct racing line will occupy much of your focus, and it's very easy to slip up and cause a wreck as a result.   The season modes and career modes are what I expected based upon last year's version, but EA did make the improvement of supplying a reference of help for running a team and providing information necessary to make important management decisions.  There are also more prompts to let you know when things have happened, and quick select buttons you can press to have the computer make some choices for you, such as what chassis and engine you should use for a given week.    Grudges and Alliances  That brings us to the ~Grudges and Alliances~ feature added this year.  Each driver has a number, positive or negative, assigned to him, which reflects his feelings toward you.  I believe the range is from -100 to +100.  When the value is positive, the driver is an ~ally~ of yours and will play nice on the track, willingly drafting with you, not moving over into you when you are alongside, etc.  But beware your enemies!  If you trade any paint with anyone on the track, regardless of whether you started it or not, you will see an image on the right of your screen showing the opponent and the new ~score.~ Your crew chief will likely chime in with a comment to the effect that you can expect some payback later on.     The game will call out your enemies on the track as they move up behind you or are in the pack of cars ahead of you, just so you can be careful when you get near them.  They will block you if you try to get around them, and if you get alongside of you and you've racked up more than 20 or so negative points with them, look out! They will swerve over and hit you.  Hard.  You'll be countersteering frantically to maintain control of your car while you put up a nice curtain of tire smoke for everyone else to drive through.   So now you know how to make enemies.  How about making friends?  When you come up behind another car close enough you'll see a message saying ~Press R2 to draft.~  Do so and you'll hear a whoosh of wind noise followed by a kind of silence where the engine noises fade into the background somewhat.  You're now in the guy's draft and you will close up on him fairly quickly.  Quickly enough that you may be tempted to lift to avoid hitting him (also known as ~bump drafting~).  But you needn't worry about THAT much realism in this title.  The game will automatically stop your forward progress within reason to keep you from hitting your drafting buddy.  As you draft, you'll see that same image used to show your enemies turn green as you begin to accrue ally points.  The better you draft, the faster the points rack up.  I was a little bothered when some of my so-called allies still drove defensively against me when I tried to move inside of them, but I guess they are still trying to win their own race.  At least they aren't clouting me with their car as I go past!   The one thing you will notice in a hurry is that it's much easier to make enemies than friends, and if you are in Season or Career mode, these guys have long memories.  Make too many enemies, and you can expect your life to get worse from race to race.  If you can hook up and draft some of your enemies and slowly and carefully turn them back into friends, life will go better for you.  One thing I didn't like is that after enemies get their licks in on you, it doesn't seem to even things out. I would have figured once a guy had taken his shot, he would cool off a bit and stop trying to take me out.  But that doesn't seem the case.  However, if you don't have any run-ins with anyone, perhaps because you never meet them on the track, they seem to mellow out toward you on their own (time heals all wounds).   The million dollar question is just how much this improves gameplay in this title.  I would say that it makes a big difference.  It's not a feature you can ignore, and you find yourself thinking about this added dimension to racing the entire time you are on the track.  You will tend to be far more cautious in traffic.  Just bumping someone up into a wall to get past them is not so appealing when you realize the guy is going to come back and take you out in a fit of revenge later on. It definitely keeps the whole ~going around and around in circles~ from being so monotonous, as every car you encounter is an opportunity to make a friend or an enemy.   Another new addition this year is the Speedzone challenge system.   As mentioned above, this is reminiscent of the mini-camp features in Madden.  You might be asked to pass as many cars as you can within the last two laps of a race, with points being gained for each successful pass, and points lost for contact with other cars or damage to your car.  Another challenge is trying to keep someone behind you.  You might also just need to drive through a fantasy track, hitting checkpoint after checkpoint.   Naturally, all these accomplishments are tracked in the new EA Sports BIO system.  When I booted up NASCAR for the first time, I got a couple of Thunder Plates, unlocking Dale Earnhardt's car, just because of the fact that I own Madden and NCAA this year.  I assume that next time I fire up those titles, there will be some extra goodies unlocked to reward me for investing in multiple EA Sports titles, as well as for whatever accomplishments I should get that should warrant cross-title unlockables.    Racing Online  Then, for the PlayStation 2 alone, online play is available.  If you've been on another planet, you may not realize that EA is at war with Microsoft over control of the online console world.  Microsoft insists that Xbox Live be centrally controlled by (you guessed it) Microsoft, whereas EA wants full control over its own games.  So Xbox owners of EA Sports games get no online play, and EA Sports owners get their own cross-product ~Live~ system for messaging each other and playing games.  In the case of NASCAR, you may play online much as you do with Madden or other EA titles.  Like those titles, EA supports the use of the Logitech microphone/headset that originally shipped with SOCOM US Navy Seals, for broadband connections only, of course.  But if you have a modem, you can still play online, and use a USB keyboard for chat purposes.   Racing online involves going into a lobby (or creating one) and challenging other players or accepting posted challenges.  Unlike the offline game, there is no ability to custom-tune setups, and only two people can participate in an online game, although a full field of AI cars is available (again, depending upon your connection).  This may be disappointing to those who are expecting the kind of racing you get with MotoGP on the Xbox, or those who envy the full fields you can get in Sierra's PC NASCAR sims.  However, racing online is still quite a bit of fun, as you can still use the grudges and alliances system with AI drivers to help improve your position.  A ranking system is in place, as well, so you can see how you match up against the rest of the online community.  While not the busy place that the Madden servers are, there are still usually at least 40 people at a time online ready to race, and you can choose to race people that show good connections to you for lower latency racing. The headset support works flawlessly, as well.   Graphics   Going from the meat and potatoes of gameplay to the presentation, graphics and sound, the PlayStation 2, as you might suspect, is not as smooth in its framerate as the Xbox version, but it still ticks along consistently and does not degrade badly when many cars are visible on the screen.  The cars will sustain realistic looking, visible damage, and you can expect debris caution flags to fly when the bodywork of a car starts to fly off.     A fully animated pit crew will service your car, and you can expect to see occasional mistakes, such as the guy holding the gas can have difficulty hooking up to the car.  Speeding in the pit lane will also add a nice 5 second delay to your stop as a stern-looking NASCAR official looks on. While these are going on, a PA announcer gives an energetic and believable play-by-play of the situation.  Similarly, when you qualify, you can expect to hear the PA working the crowd up as much as possible while talking about you.   Your crew chief is generally helpful, letting you know when you are running low on fuel and what the drivers around you are doing.  I'm not sure he's always 100% truthful when he tells you ~You're faster than the leader,~ but I think he probably is when he says: ~You're helping with the bodywork this week,~ after I've just scraped the side of the car against a wall.   Sound  The sound of the engines is much better than on the PC version I reviewed.  When the cars all fire up their engines in pit lane, it sounds perfect. I can't think of a single complaint to level against the quality of the sound. However, I do have a gripe with the spotter.  He's usually late in giving you the calls regarding traffic high or low.  You need to develop a sixth sense for what's going on around you if you want to avoid wrecking.  You can't just rely on your spotter to be accurate or timely.  That definitely needs to be improved.So, what's the final judgment on this title?  As long as you don't come in expecting any serious realism in the driving model, there are many ways to play and enjoy this title.  It has all the Winston Cup tracks and a bunch of really nice new fantasy tracks, which are oval-optimized road courses (banking, wide sweeping turns, etc).  It has a career mode, a season mode, online play, Thunder Plates, the Speedzone challenges, the real-life situation Lightning Challenges, customizable paint jobs, online play modes, tutorials and training videos, etc.  In short, the game is simply PACKED with playing modes and features, all of which look and sound great.If you are unsure about whether you will enjoy driving this physics model and you didn't try out last year's physics, rent this one and see if you can deal with it.  Once you grow accustomed to the driving model, you will find a very fun and long lasting NASCAR title, and the online play should keep you playing indefinitely.", "date": "Sep 22, 2003"}
