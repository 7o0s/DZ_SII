The game was later ported to other systems, like the ill-fated Atari Lynx and the original NES -- and now MFORMA has brought the sun-drenched title to mobile... where it belongs. A game with play mechanics this simple, but with oodles of replay value (especially when linked up to Sprint's Game Lobby), California Games reminds me of better days.   Four events make up California Games: Surfing, Half-Pipe, Hackey Sack, and BMX. Each event can be played by itself for practice before entering a full competition. After mastering each event, you can then play them together for ranking. California Games features multiple saves, so you can play pass-the-phone multiplayer with friends.   Surfing drops you right in front of a cresting wave. You must carve a path through the water to put some distance between your board and the churn. When you have enough lead, you spike the board into the air and rotate as many times as you can for points, then direct the board back down for a successful landing. Half-Pipe is a skateboard competition far more simplified than Tony Hawk. This is arguably the weakest event, but only due to the unavoidable comparison. In Hackey Sack, you try to juggle the sack in the air with foot and head bounces, while turning and twisted to perform tricks. Finally, BMX is a bike race over a bumpy course, with you avoiding hazards while getting enough air to perform rotations.   (Note: On more powerful handsets, California Games includes rollerskating and frisbee.)   The events are pretty fun individually, but strung together, old schoolers will have a ball. Surfing is still my favorite event after all these years, and if you really practice you can get some incredible rotations. The controls on the Sanyo 8200 I used worked fine -- good and responsive.   California Games looks like reasonable facsimile of the classic. The sun-soaked colors are all there. The game uses little music, opting for slight sound effects during the events. This was kind of a disappointment, as some of the events are just too quiet.  California Games is a nice throwback for the fans, but newcomers should find some solid enjoyment out of this game. The only ~bad~ event in the Half-Pipe, but as I said, it's only hurt by what's available today. As a package deal, though, California Games is a good value and offers some solid replay. You can always hit it again for a better score; you know, try and get just one more rotation before crashing down into the surf. With the rain starting to collect outside my office window, California Games is a nice window to my days in LA.", "date": "Oct 6, 2005"}
