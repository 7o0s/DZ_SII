And if there's a movie, sure enough, the mobile game can't be far behind. Hands On Mobile invites you to seize the handlebars of a genuine Hell's Angel in their pocket-edition Ghost Rider.   The legend goes that stunt rider Johnny Blaze sold his soul to Mephistopheles to save his father's life -- but in so doing, had to abandon his true love, Roxanne.  Mephistopheles, being the sort of demon whose infernal sadism belies a squishy interior, offers Blaze a chance to return to his heart's desire as a ~supernatural agent of vengeance and justice~ known as Ghost Rider.  (He gets a black leather jacket as a bonus.)   The game's story finds Mephistopheles assigning Ghost Rider to tackle the rogue demon Blackheart.  What all of this means is, you control Ghost Rider as he streaks through five somewhat (but just barely) unique settings on his Hell Cycle.  Dispatch demons as you go, and avoid cars whose drivers don't seem to have noticed the flaming, skull-faced cyclist in their rearview mirror.  Your ultimate goal: the time-honored level boss.   Steering is pretty standard: use your 4 and 6 buttons or press left and right on your directional pad.  You can also perform power slides and wheelies on your bike, although they don't appear to provide much of a tactical advantage.   Your arsenal consists of Fire Balls and a Hell Fire Shotgun that you blast at enemies up ahead.  When you draw 'em in close, fling your Hell Chain at their scabby heads, then tap on the center button or 5 key until you've flamed them out.  It can be tricky tapping the key while navigating a sharp corner -- but not too tricky.  You never actually crash off-road, so there isn't a ton of incentive for straight steering.   The levels are essentially long, curving roads that scroll by and you have to tilt your bike every so often.  In fact, much of the time Ghost Rider reminded me of a tricked-out update of Hang On, the motorcycle game that was an pack-in release for the Sega Master System.  And, it must be noted, the organ-like score was strikingly similar to Capcom's classic Ghosts & Goblins, which is always a good thing.  (I kept hoping to see Arthur crawl out of the ground beside the road.)   The meat of the game consists of dodging cars, building up your flame level so you can launch into a fiery rage that enables you to take out all villains with just a touch, and trying like mad to fire projectiles in something like a direct path toward an upcoming demon.  The shooting aspect is the weakest component of the game play; I could barely tell when I'd hit something up ahead, and aiming is rather imprecise -- it seems to depend mostly on luck.  The Hell Chain is your most effective weapon, since you're more than likely to end up in close-quarters combat with your foes -- and it is fun to swing your chain at various servants of darkness, even if the novelty wears off around the two-thousandth time.   Ghost Rider is a simple game with simple goals.  If you're tickled by the idea of dispatching untold numbers of undead henchmen on a fiery bike, well, this is the game you've always dreamt of.  There's a basic appeal to a game this direct and uncomplicated, something that taps into the pre-teen Genesis player in so many of us.   The game allows you to skip levels, as well, which isn't terribly advisable since there are only five levels to speak of -- but if you get bored with one, you can always move on.  Level three is a cemetery, a setting I always enjoy.  If you're of a certain macabre disposition, then you, too, may relish streaking past constantly scrolling graves while flaming yet another identical demon (why are they all on bikes, anyway -- is Hell just Motocross in brimstone?).   On the minus side, the barely animated cut-scenes are lackluster at best, containing such memorable exchanges as, ~Surf's up, Ghost Rider!  Let's see how your flames cope with water!~  To which the eloquent Blaze retorts, ~My flames will reduce you to steam in no time!~  One can only hope this stunning dialogue was taken directly from the screenplay.   The game play is mindlessly repetitious, involving a lot of shooting and chain-swinging at unchanging villains.  Even the bosses look and behave an awful lot like slightly tougher versions of the regular demon minions.  I wish it had more variety, and that the bosses got tougher and more distinctive.  Environmental interaction is minimal, as well; when you have a course set in a graveyard, couldn't you add a few zombie hands bursting up from the earth or some open graves to jump or something?  Overall, Ghost Rider adds up to a minor diversion, offering some fun, if forgettable, moments of dispatching numerous, not-very-difficult demons.  It's not even remotely challenging (nor terribly rewarding), but there are worse reasons to mash some buttons on your phone.", "date": "Jan 12, 2007"}
