Its pick-up-and-play design belied a surprisingly deep strategy game that, every single time you played, seemed to only reveal more surprises  and, consequently, managed to keep me up later and later each subsequent night. It's been a good eight years since the game's release, and now it's back with new maps, modes, and somewhat flashier graphics... and I'm every bit as addicted the second time around.The premise is a simple enough one: you play as one side in a war to claim control of the lunar surface. Units are moved around on a hex-based map turn-by-turn, and battles take place in an equally traditional turn-based fashion. Each unit has its specialty, such as an extra long-range attack, but also has a corresponding shortcoming (it may be especially acceptable to close-range attacks, for example). Terrain type and elevation also comes into play when factoring the victor in each melee.As I alluded to before, Nectaris' strength lies both in its simplicity and complexity; something that might seem like an oxymoron right now, but trust me  once you start playing, you'll know what I mean. To risk sounding  clich, it takes about a minute to learn, and, well, a little less than a week to master. Once you start playing, it's hard not to get hooked. Learning the ins-and-outs of each unit, then drawing on their inherent strengths to conquer each map is extremely rewarding, and, due largely to its straight-forward design, ends up providing more pure enjoyment than many other titles in the genre.In terms of a technical ~wow~ factor, the game possesses very little; Hudson has done a purely adequate job in re-vamping the classic from a visual standpoint. You'll be hard-pressed to tell the map screens apart from those in the TG-16 version, but the polygonal battles possess enough 32-bit flair to reaffirm that, yes, you're playing a PlayStation game. Of all the upgrades that have been made, however, the most welcome has to be the construction mode that, as its name implies, lets one create their own scenarios. As if the replay value wasn't good enough already, this was enough to send me over the edge  oh, and by the way, it makes for an excellent two-player game as well.Nectaris may not be the most technically stunning additions to the PlayStation's catalog, but I say ~so what?~ It's easily one of the best strategy games I've played on the system. It's incredibly fun, fiendishly addictive, and thanks to the new maps and construction mode, even those who've grown tired of the TG-16 original (how could you?) have good reason to pick up a copy. It's made my ~A~ list, and, if you possess even the slightest interest in strategy games, it comes highly recommended.Randy Nelson", "date": "Jan 23, 1999"}
