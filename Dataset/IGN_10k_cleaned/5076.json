It has a frustrating informational interface, frustrating construction interface, frustratingly inconsistent AI, frustratingly bad visuals, and frustratingly irritating sound. What's even more frustrating is that there's a lot of features and content underneath the many layers frustration just waiting for someone with infinite patience to come along and figure it out.   Chris Sawyer released Transport Tycoon back in 1994. This game is the same game, but worse for the fact that it hasn't evolved into anything better in a full ten years and that other transport and industry games have come out that have been a thousand times better than it for the fact that they had functional interfaces that provided information and easy construction.   As stated in the intro to the manual, Locomotion is, in many parts, a simple game. You have to connect different places together in order to transport different cargo from point A to point B. Whether that cargo is people or whether it's chemicals, it doesn't matter. As a budding transportation tycoon, you'll have to build a network of transportation that fills the needs of a map as thoroughly as possible. While the concept might seem a little boring to some people, it can actually be more than a little addicting and very fun to construct an efficient network and watch the areas around it blossom thanks to your efforts.   Unfortunately for Locomotion, it's all the stuff surrounding the core gameplay ideas that drag it down into the murky depths. And that's the key here. The game is deep. There is no mistake about that. There are a ton of options here and several ways that players can try to complete tasks given. But it's hard to want to go as deep as you can when the water is so murky that you can't see an inch in front of your face.   Locomotion uses another iteration of the engine used to power the RollerCoaster Tycoon series (which I'll get into more in a minute) and therefore uses the same basic interface. Everything is broken up into tabbed pages in different areas. The problem is, sorting through them and finding the information you want can be a chore. Instead of providing nice graphical details on zoomed out map (such as Railroad Tycoon III tried to make available), you'll have to move into window upon window. And when you do find a window or piece of information that you want, it's never enough. For example, there is a map that can give an overview of the entire area including where towns, industry, roads, railroads, stations, and vegetation are, but it doesn't tell you what kinds of industry these places are! Why not have a pulled back view showing all of the industries color coded to the type so you can try to figure out where you're supposed to be moving what. As it is, you have to pause the game and spend a bunch of time wandering around the map trying to figure out where anything is in the first place.   There should be ease of use in these sheets as well. For example, when you click on a city, there should be a list of all of the stations and ports in that city along with all of the vehicles attached to them. When in the town tab (shows all of the towns on a map) there should be a number of vehicles operating in the area listed and both that and the number of stations should be able to be clicked on to bring up another list of all of those item. Clicking on each of the stations and vehicles should bring up more information about performance and need there as well.   Managing your fleets of vehicles can also be a pain. Eventually, your vehicles are going to get old and outdated. Replacing them should be much easier than it is. Why not have a function that simply allows you to upgrade a vehicle to a newer better vehicle with the click of a button? Hell, having a button that would upgrade all of a certain type of vehicle to a new one would be nice. Making decisions and actions like these more accessible would have cut down on a lot of hassles.    But more outrageous than any of the information related interface is the construction interface. It's terrible. Somehow, it's actually quite a bit worse than it was in RollerCoaster Tycoon. It's really difficult to judge where tracks and roads need to go to connect, especially when dealing with different heights (yes I know there are height markers), and that creates a huge problem because there is no leeway for making mistakes. You only get a fraction of the cost of building a road back if you make a mistake and have to start over. It becomes necessary to save before every major piece of construction so that you can try again when you mess up. Because you will mess up. A lot of this has to do with engine and how it's built. It's just old and clunky at this point.   On top of it's drawbacks from a construction standpoint, both the engine and a severe lack of artistic direction contributed to an abysmally ugly game. I had already figured that the engine wouldn't wow me. But the lack of any personality or interesting visuals, is absolutely surprising. RollerCoaster Tycoon managed to find some niche of fun and frolic despite technical drawbacks at one point, but Locomotion is dragging the muck to the top here. There is nothing in this entire game that I would consider good by any standard. There's no style, no panache, and no fun. Buildings and towns are depressingly simple and boring, there's no blending of texture terrains, and very little detail.   Finally, a word has to be said about the AI. Both the competitive AI and more importantly, the pathfinding AI, are unpredictable at best. I've built networks of trains that work without fail and others that have no end of problems. Trains don't always stop directly at signals and networks created to facilitate a smooth flow of rail traffic are undermined by AI that doesn't always pick the shortest route to a destination. Road vehicles have different problems of driving off in the wrong direction if given a starting stop that happens to be behind them. Also, vehicles will aggravatingly turn themselves back on after being told to stop. Sometimes, you just need these vehicles to stop and stay stopped while you fix roads. Having them start down tracks you're trying to fiddle with is a detriment to an already problematic construction process.With a lack of presentation values, an engine that not only looks bad but also is the main cause of serious construction problems, and AI that could use a serious overhaul, Locomotion has too many problems for any serious recommendation.There's plenty of content, scenarios to keep diehard fans with blinders on interested.  There's even multiplayer mode with either Gamespy or TCP/IP connect only (which I never would have found it if not for the manual) that's only appeal is the chance to play against an unpredictable human opponent. Good luck finding a game over Gamespy, I couldn't.The world has kept moving along with technology to allow players friendlier and more entertaining game experiences. It would have benefited this ~spiritual successor~ to Transport Tycoon to have jumped on that train. Frankly, I can only imagine that players who have gotten used to working around Transport Tycoon's flaws will be able to forgive Locomotion for its inadequacies.", "date": "Oct 6, 2004"}
