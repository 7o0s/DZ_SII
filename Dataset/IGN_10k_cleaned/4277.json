It's still looked at as if it's a rebel that's toppled the kingpin of football. But this year, that label won't stick, because last year Gameday was considered the best football game, and this year, it's done it again. Gameplay While last year's game was great, it was coined more of an arcade game than Madden. This year's game is far more of a simulation. It runs smoothly and quickly, and there are few stutters in play. This year's game features Total Control Passing, a decent addition to widen the game's control and deepen it feel. And this year's title also includes a bigger list of plays, enabling a broader offensive strategy. Compared to Madden it's almost equal in numbers.   What always makes football games great is the ability to control your players, and this year's Gameday is packed with cool abilities, such as speed bursts, spins, hurdles, dives, stiff-arms, jukes, pile-diving, high stepping, double-spins, and a few others. But what's the greatest aspect of this year's Gameday is that you can feel the surge of the run, the power of the hurdle, and the cut of the runner's feet into the ground. And of course if you're a real showboat, there are humorous dances, salutes, etc., at the end of great plays, also to be found in Madden.   Player responsiveness is crucial to any football game, and Gameday corners this aspect better than any football game around. You know you are playing a quick game when you pick this puppy up in the first few minutes. With so many players on the screen, both EA and 989 have had to really push their engines to the max to get the feel of real players, and while both do a good job, Gameday's is better.     One other area in which the game sees drastic improvement is the computer teammates. It's so cool to see the evolution of the players' thinking. Offensive linemen fill the gap, fullbacks block in the right spots (even though they'd rather run it themselves), and tight ends and wide receivers adjust to their routes accordingly.   Gameday's defensive AI has improved over last year's version, which is a true piece of work. In many ways, this year's Madden's AI has vastly improved and contends with Gameday's AI for true realism. But, Gameday's Authentic Football Intelligence is a big step for the series, and truly puts it on top. The game now makes calls on penalties with much more accuracy. The areas it covers are roughing the passer, false starts, pass interference, holding, and a few others. You can see defensive players also moving in the secondary as they adjust to the offensive set up. The level of complexity and realism is much higher than last year's title, and it shows. Graphics One of the best parts of the overall feel of Gameday is its presentation. When you are playing through your game, you can hit the button and quickly choose the plays you want; you can skip past plays once they're done; and you can even speed up the play after the huddle. These are features that keep the game moving, an aspect not found in Madden.   As with last year's Gameday, the players are fully polygonal, texture-mapped, and Gouraud shaded. These players look great! You can see muscles, the corners, edges, and outlines of each player appear sharp and crisp, and the color palette is phenomenally clean and fresh. When it comes down to it, the players in both Madden and Gameday look pretty damn good, and it's clear the competition between the two camps has given gamers two wholly better looking games. But Gameday looks the best  it's got double the amount of polygons of last year's game, and you can tell.  Animation/Motion What's impressive about Gameday this year is that despite the polygon-packed screen, the game is fluid and smooth in both look and feel. Each player cuts across the field like he should, and gets tackled like the sorry bastard he is (heh heh).   Gameday doesn't have the littany of individual animation scenes that Madden does, and so a lot of tackles appear the same, despite the fact that there are more tackle animations than last year's. But the impact is actually greater because the game's frame rate and animation are both fast and smooth, respectively. As a whole, 989 Studios has done an excellent job of making leaps and bounds each year with the strength of its game.   Additionally, there are more player animations, which seem to have originated from the arcade phenomenon NFL Blitz. The addition of these cool little scenes sparks the game with a more realistic atmosphere.  Sound Effects  Both madden and Gameday have excellent music and sound effects. They really are equal there. But the area that Gameday really exceeds its partner is in the commentary department. The commentary of by Dick Enberg and Phil Simms is really life-like. It's fast, and occurs right after the play. It's injected often, and pulls you right into the game. And despite the fact that Madden is a colorful, quirky guy  and a true master strategist  the implementation of his commentary during gameplay doesn't compete with Gameday's.   In the end, Gameday for the PlayStation is pure bliss. It's improved in all of the areas it was weakest last year, and then went one step further in both graphics and gameplay, the two areas in which it was already supreme.
