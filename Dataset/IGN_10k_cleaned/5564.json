The latest proof of their prowess in this area is the wonderful Gary Grigsby's World at War. Those who know the team's history shouldn't be terribly surprised; Grigsby and his colleagues Joel Billings and Keith Brors at 2 by 3 Games have worked on some outstanding wargames over the years. World at War is particularly enjoyable, however, because it effectively marries complex wargame concepts like supply and combined arms with a relatively convenient interface and an intuitive design that's easy for novices to digest.  The new game simulates the Second World War on a global scale. Players can take on the leadership of Germany (with Italy), Japan, Russia, the Western Allies (the combined forces of America and Great Britain) or China.  The game begins in the spring of 1940 and ends in the fall of 1946 with each turn representing three months of fighting and production. Players will be in charge of moving their forces around the map, managing logistics, creating new units and researching crucial combat technologies.  There are a variety of scenarios in the game but the only difference between them is the starting date. You can play through the whole War starting with the blitzkrieg into France or start a bit later in, beginning in the summer of 1941 just before Pearl Harbor and Barbarossa, the spring of 1942 just before the Allied turns in Russia and the Pacific, or the summer of 1943 when things have been going really badly for the Axis. For the most enjoyment, you're going to want to choose the full scenario. Depending on how much you think through your decisions, you can play through a full game in a day. The scenarios with the later start dates make for an interesting challenge if you choose to play as one of the Axis players.  You'll be leading up to 19 different types of units. Infantry, armor and artillery make up your ground forces but you'll also be able to supplement these with flak guns, local militias and paratroopers. Your air forces are made up of fighters, tactical bombers, heavy bombers and carrier air groups. At sea you'll have the chance to utilize light and heavy warships, carriers, and submarines. Each of the units has a specific role to play in your overall strategy. Artillery makes a good weapon for coastal defense, taking shots at passing ships and landing craft. While heavy bombers are ideal for attacking enemy factories and rail networks, you'll want to use tactical bombers in support of ground attacks.   Moving armies around isn't as easy as clicking and dragging. Each unit that makes an attack has to be supported with supply trucks. Though not a military unit, these supply trucks and their seaborne counterparts, the transports, are absolutely vital to your success. If they're not adequately supplied, your offensives can stall out very quickly. Fortunately, you won't need to use supply trucks to move forces that aren't going to engage in combat. In that case, you'll simply take advantage of the rail networks in each region. Even here there are some limitations. Since the quality and size of the rail network can only support a limited amount of traffic each turn, you may find yourself unable to move lots of forces through the same area during the same turn.  Once you've moved your forces into an enemy territory, the combat resolution is entirely out of your hands. The best you can do is to make sure you're sending the right kind of units into the right kind of combat. A combat analysis tool lets you see your likelihood of winning the fight and an approximate expectation for losses on both sides. But just because the game tells you that you have a 70 or 80% chance of winning a territory, a random factor is thrown into the mix just to keep you guessing.  Each unit is rated in a number of factors that influence combat and there are tons of modifiers that affect combat under certain conditions. Amphibious assaults, surprise invasions, winter weather and many more circumstances can shift the advantage in battle. Though the computer does a good job determining which opposing units pair up in the attack, I wish the manual spelled out the specific targeting priorities. Seeing infantry units attacking planes leaves me with some odd questions.  Fights aren't all or nothing affairs. Most units can take two hits before being destroyed so it's likely that both the attacker and defender will have lots of damaged units after a fight. Damaged units are automatically sent to the repair queue on your power's production track. Their repair will consume more resources but it's cheaper than building a new unit from scratch. Whenever possible undamaged units retreat to an adjacent friendly province. If there are no adjacent provinces, all the units on the losing side are destroyed.  It's not just about moving units. You'll have to make them as well. Regions designated as resource centers produce the raw materials your factories need to make new units. Units also consume population points wherever they're createad. Though the interface for setting production orders is simple enough, I wish you could issue production orders on the main game map. Having to remember where the factories are located while you're setting production orders makes it a little more difficult to produce the right types of units in the right locations.      Managing supply is almost a game in itself, no small surprise given that this same team brought us the fantastic logistical game Uncommon Valor. At first glance, management of the supply system seems just like an additional diversion, a little bit of extra gameplay thrown in just to make the game complicated. Once you start to see how the system works though, you realize it's an excellent way of balancing the game and ensuring that the frontlines have more than just a geometric significance.  You can get as involved as you like in terms of managing your supply network. If taking full charge of everything seems a little daunting (which it will at first) you can let the computer handle the manufacture and movement of your supply trucks and transports. Though the option exists to ignore the supply rules altogether, this tends to unbalance the game. Since you can't attack without a sufficient number of supply points, doing away with this requirement allows for Risk-like offensives that steamroll across the board.  The danger of unrealistic, massive, repeated attacks in all directions is further reduced by the damage invasion does to the infrastructure of a region. You'll find that conquering a territory means much more than just moving a lot of troops in. When you capture a territory, the rail and factory systems are immediately and severely damaged. Once your invasions have extended a few territories away from your original borders, you'll find that it gets harder to move troops to the frontline. You can spend supply points to repair the damage but that means you'll have fewer supplies for your troops to fight with. In the meantime, you'll still have to ensure that you have plenty of supply trucks in territories just behind the frontline.  Populations in conquered territories are also unsuitable for military service so the troops you do build will have to come from your own home regions. You can still use conquered territories to produce supply trucks or research new technologies but that's about all they're good for. If the original owners of a conquered territory consider you hostile (and why wouldn't they?) you'll also have to maintain a garrison there to prevent the local population from sabotaging the infrastructure there.   Assuming you don't let the computer AI handle it all for you, there's a whole lot to manage here in World at War. A comprehensive tutorial introduces you to the larger concepts, but you'll still need to dive into the manual to get the most out of this game. The manual itself is organized very well and covers most topics in a clear and comprehensive manner. Best of all there's a sizeable section near the end that discusses in detail the broad strategies available to each of the five powers in the game. Reading the sections on your enemies proves useful as well since it points out the areas in which they might be vulnerable.  The AI is a worthy opponent. What with everything you'll have to manage here, the computer definitely has a few advantages. It's particularly good at seeking out weak points in your defenses and manages to maintain layers of defensive in depth.  This can make it hard to break through even the widest fronts. A more interesting challenge is provided when you play against human opponents. The hotseat mode is fun but the PBEM version of the game gives you much more time to think about your moves.  Having played through the entire War as a number of different nations, it's clear to see that the basic setup requires the Axis players to secure victory quickly before the industrial might of the Americans begins to shift the advantage to the Allied side. The German invasion of Russia has to maintain momentum. By the end of 1944 the German player has to have taken Moscow and the Japanese player has to have beaten China and Britain nearly to death in the Pacific in order to throw their full weight against the offensives launched by the Americans.  In terms of theaters, you'll be able to predict a few general trends but the fun of the game is that things begin to develop differently than they did historically. Though Germany is bound to invade France on the very first turn, things can go anywhere from there. Allied efforts in Africa will reduce the commitments they can make in the Pacific but it also means that the Germans will have to divert troops badly needed for the invasion of Russia. But any invasion of Africa depends on Allied control of the Atlantic. If the British fleet in the Indian Ocean commits to supporting a defense of Africa, the Japanese may swoop down and secure a foothold in Australia. Though I've yet to see more bizarre developments like a Russo-Japanese war or a German invasion of Brazil, there's a fair amount of variety from campaign to campaign.  In terms of disappointments, World at War definitely offers a few. While the interface is very easy to read, it lacks a few conveniences. It's impossible to tell which units have moved and which haven't without clicking on every single province you have. This isn't a big deal for the Chinese but German and Russian players will find themselves getting confused when they have to mobilize for a large battle. You can read about each of the triggers that will activate these frozen nations in the manual but there needs to be some sort of explanation within the game for each of these cases. Leaving less than three Japanese infantry in Manchuria means that the Soviet armies in the East will become active. The game should remind players of things like is when they're about to trigger such an event. The supply concepts could be more explicit as well. The available points and the cost of an attack move should be much more visible.  Some gamers may also complain that the graphics are a bit dated. We're often forgiving of wargames in this regard. After all, the game design is much more important than the visuals, particularly for this genre. Even so, World at War has a nice aesthetic. The boardgame look suits the game well; the map is clear and colorful and each power has a unique unit set. German fighters look like Bf109s, Allied tanks look like Shermans, Japanese heavy fleets look like the Yamamato.  The battle view lets you see each of your units facing off against your enemy's units. Each unit fires in turn, targeting a unit of the opposing side. Apart from the impressive smoke and fire effects on damaged and destroyed units, the whole experience is much too static. After watching the battles play out this way for a few turns, I turned the option off.  These battle views offer up the widest range of sound effects as well. Each unit type has its own combat sound and while it does add a little personality to the game, it also grows monotonous. There's unique music for each power in the game which adds even more character to the experience.Matrix Games is doing its best to support the wargaming market these days. Titles like Gary Grigsby's World at War are a welcome addition to the genre. It has the best of both worlds -- an endlessly sophisticated design based on some natural concepts that are easy to understand. The actual movement of troops is the most accessible and obviously enjoyable part of the game but the rewards of managing your supply chains and setting production priorities are absolutely undeniable. The unpredictable development of the war is nicely balanced by a the historical setup and very realistic modeling of a variety of factors. Though human opponents will still provide the most enjoyable challenge, the AI is no slouch here.", "date": "Mar 10, 2005"}
