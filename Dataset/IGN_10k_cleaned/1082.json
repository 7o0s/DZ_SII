The ~Extreme~ genre is picking up steam in the videogame field, and Infogrames entry is a refreshing, quality product that has lots to offer . . . and lots to like. Plus . . . it's EXTREME!!!Features Five Xtreme sporting events: Skateboarding, Surfing, Skateboarding, Sky Surfing and Street Luge Multiple track layouts Two Xtreme racers: Fin and Guppi Battery Back-up Only for Game Boy ColorXtreme Sports isn't a simulation of five Extreme sports  it doesn't even try to be. No, the game is instead a fast-paced action game which revolves around the adrenaline-pulsing events of Surfing, Inline Skating, Skateboarding, Sky Surfing and Street Luge. It even parodies the attitude by injecting fictional ~EXTREME~ product placements throughout the game. Xtreme Cola! Drink it up kids, it'll make you extreme!!!The five games only borrow elements from the actual sports they portray. For example, in Skateboarding, you can grind the rails and hit the halfpipe for tricks, but you're limited in what you can accomplish. All the events have a specific task  beat the round with the most points (accomplished by performing tricks and picking up point icons), collect as many of the six ~hidden~ flags along the way and finish with the fastest time possible. The Inline Skating and Skateboarding events are more like platform-style sidescrolling games than they are a simulation of the sports. Surfing and Skysurfing are much like horizontal and vertical-scrolling shooters without the guns  heavy focus is placed on weaving between obstacles as the screen forcefully scrolls in the proper direction. And Street Luge is much like a top-down racer where you'll have to maneuver through the gates without crashing and losing precious time. All the levels are extremely (sorry) challenging and loads of fun, and encourage lots of trial and error to gain a bunch of necessary points.The actual game requires loads of wandering around the world's map  and in this sense, that's a lot like an RPG's ~wandering~ phase. When your character meets up with another character, it's time to battle it out for the medal they hold  before the round you're given their best time, score and flags accomplished, and you'll have to beat all the numbers shown. But each character has a different score setting  in some cases you won't have to worry about collecting flags or getting a high score . . . simply beating the track under the set time is all that's accomplished. Other portions of the world will only open up if you acquire the proper amount of medals. Think you have the skills and patience to get through the gate that requires four hundred of those sparkly medal things? Good grief . . . I think the biggest problem in Xtreme Sports is its maniacal pace  the levels and game are well-thought-out, but all of them require a fast speed and a LOT of quick reaction on the buttons. Your characters are rather large on screen, and there's not much head's up when obstacles approach or when the platforms go in different directions. I guess this is the same problem I had with Sonic the Hedgehog . . . you need to run really fast and jump at a point where you think you'll make it alive. Lots of practice is necessary in Xtreme Sports. Maybe that's why they included a Practice mode right up front.What you won't see me complain about are the graphics. This is one of, if not the most beautifully styled games I've seen on the Game Boy Color. The game has a very anime/manga flair, even though the game was designed in Southern California. Lara Croft's got nothing on the female characters in this game  heck, I should be sent to jail with some of the evil thoughts that went through my mind after seeing close-ups of main character Guppi. And she's only fifteen??? Good god . . .I would have loved to see WayForward stick in a Link Cable mode somewhere in Xtreme Sports to add to the longevity of the product  playing these five games over and over to go through the ranks to become the best Xtreme Sports person on the island will andactually does get a bit tedious. But for a pick-up-and-play game, this Game Boy Color title offers a fresh approach to the whole skating/surfing Mountain Dew-slamming world. Compared to what's been offered already on the Game Boy Color, Xtreme Sports is onthe top. I will have to comment that the skateboarding and wave surfing on the California Games for Atari's Lynx still have yet to be topped . . . but Xtreme Sports comes pretty close for what Nintendo's handheld is able to do.", "date": "Jul 7, 2000"}
