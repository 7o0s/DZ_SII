IGN64.com has been monitoring game's progress for a while and although the game certainly had all the potential to succeed, the finished product seems to be lacking that spark of ingenuity that attracts many gamers coming back to the genre.Don't get me wrong, Quest 64 is not a bad game at all. It's got great graphics and sound, and THQ should be commended for producing an above average attempt to give N64 owners what they've been asking for since the release of the system: A game with more depth than the pursuit of an evil witch who has kidnapped some animal sweetheart. Unfortunately, this is the main area where Quest 64 doesn't succeed. Replace ~witch~ with ~wizard~ and ~animal sweetheart~ with ~father,~ and you've got Quest's plot. Neverthless, beginners who have little to no experience with RPGs and are looking for a first encounter with the genre will love Quest.Story The story of this 3D RPG follows the adventures of Brian, a young adventuring boy who has the unique power to manipulate nature, and has been annointed as a guardian of humankind, a so-called Spirit Tamer. Equipped with a large list of magic spells, Brian can alter and control four nature spirits -- earth, water, fire, air -- to his liking, and to the disappointment of his enemies. For example, you can mix earth and fire to create a lava spell. These talents are sorely needed, as Brian battles the Master Wizard who has stolen the mystical volume of the spirit tamers and is throwing the land into darkness and spritual chaos. During his quest, Brian will encounter many towns in peril, people looking for ~something,~ and big, bad boss monsters that won't to do him in. Sadly, the story never really takes off and many gamers will be slightly bored by the premise from the get-go. Unlike many N64 titles, Quest does little in the way of cut-scenes to drive the story. If you enter a ship to cross a lake, for example, you will simply go under deck and then come out in a different area. If you're waiting for big surprises, character development or plot twists, Quest is not the game for you.GameplayThe game is played like a mixture of Mario 64 (minus the jumping) and every other RPG out there. Run around in the 3D environments, talk to people, open treasure chests and build your character up by fighting battles (which occur randomly outside the towns). There are a number of cool touches, such as the progression from day to night -- but the impact on gameplay is minimal. I was hoping for lots of instances where people would say different things at night than during day-time, but alas, kids will continue to play in the village at night and their mothers will continue to insist that it's getting dark -- even when the sun is already rising again. As a matter of fact, the conversations with the NPCs are mostly pointless and only there to flesh out there story. I was looking forward to tons of secrets and puzzles in Quest -- but everything just seems to simple and straightforward.On the other hand, the magic system coupled with the C-Button control is fairly innovative. In order to raise Brian's magic abilities and advance in the game, players must find magic gems that are hidden in the game's polygonal landscapes, castles and caves. You have to have a good eye to discover them, as they are represented by faint little geysers. Once you find one, you determine which one of your nature spirits you want to raise by pressing the corresponding C-Button. As you build up your four elementals, you can mix more powerful spells. Unfortunately, the balance in Quest 64 is way off. You can basically beat the game with a minimum of spells (you'll figure them out) and there are plenty of spells you will just never use. Whereas most RPGs encourage the player to experiment with different spells against different enemies, the differences in Quest are so slight, you can almost always stick to one elemental and succeed. We were sure that Imagineer would adjust the balance of spells vs. monsters in the final version of Quest, but sadly that didn't happen.The real-time battles are a cool idea (although they happen far too often while you're roaming the landscapes). You can run around and try to avoid enemy attacks during battles and escape by moving outside the octagonal zones that divide the battle grounds. While there are plenty of different spells to be discovered in the game, the limitation of one physical attack (hit someone with your magic stick) and the lack of other party members with different attacks is really restrictive to the depth of the battles.But what really kills the game for older gamers (including me) is the item and barter system -- or the lack thereof. Although there are plenty of taverns and stores in the town, you can't buy stuff. That's right. You don't earn money by fighting enemies and you can't buy new items. Every item you can use in the game can only be ~given~ to you, and has only one use. This simplistic gameplay makes Quest an ideal game for beginners who don't want to mess with too many menus. Expert gamers, on the other hand, once they get used to orienting themselves in a 3D environment (good thing there is a compass and the fact that the game automatically turns you into the right direction after fights), will cruise through the game in about 20 hours.GraphicsQuest proves beyond a doubt that compelling RPG graphics are possible on a cart. The 3D environments may look a little bare when you're outside in the fields, but the towns and castles are gorgeous. Walking around the villages and exploring the insides of buildings never fails to impress. While the design of the main character should have undergone some changes for the US (what's with that quail look), most gamers will love the traditional Japanese style of this game. On the downside, the graphics for the magic spells are utterly forgettable and have a very unfinished look to them.SoundQuest's enjoyable music is another nice surprise. Reminiscent of Square's Super NES RPGs, the well-composed tunes do a great job accompanying the action on-screen. It's nothing ground-breaking, but there are quite a few ~hummable~ songs that won't get old too quickly.Data ManagementWhenever you enter an inn, you can store multiple game saves on a controller pak. It's quick an painless and works like a charm. No Rumble Pak support.Quest 64 comes across as an unfinished game (wait till you see the ending...). It has all the potential to be a cool, involving RPG, if only the programmers would have invested more time to give it more depth and hired better writers. In the end, the game will mainly still younger players' hunger for RPGs. Older gamers will be disappointed by the simplistic plot and the total lack of character development (what ever happened to the other party members that were originally planned to accompany Brian?). If you've never played an RPG on any system (or your experience is limited to, say, Mystic Quest), you will find a lot to like in Quest 64. For more experienced players, we suggest renting it first before making a purchasing decision.", "date": "Jun 12, 1998"}
