The emphasis, ordinarily, is on replication. But Electronic Arts can't be bothered with all that guff. Instead, it's gone for a ballsy no-holds barred stunt-racing game based on the 30-year-old Hot Wheels franchise. The aim here is not necessarily to outpace your opponents, but to upend and crush them.  Gameplay With that kind of mission objective, you'd expect the vehicles in the game to be exceptionally maneuverable and you wouldn't be disappointed. In other EA racers  Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit for example -- you may well end up doing a flip, or a barrel roll, or possibly even a full somersault if you really take a jump badly. But in Hot Wheels Turbo Racing, all that  happens if you take a jump well! Using the specially-designed 'E-brake' in unison with the Turbo meter, the vehicle under your control becomes a vehicle with acrobatic purpose. The developing team use what it describes as a ~very complicated physics model~ that enables the airborne  vehicles to spin, roll and turn right over. Better, you can create combos just by stringing these all together - something that seriously racks up the points. Not to mention being a lot of fun.  More than 40 cars from the series make it into the game (more are unlocked as  you progress). They all are capable of aerial tricks but some are more capable than others. Double Vision, for instance, is great for stunts but has a lower top speed than, say, the 1995 Power Pipes. Where you lose out on stunt ability, you gain in speed, so players need to sort  out whether they're the ~spinning madly in the air type of guy,~ or the  ~I'm going to whup your @ss on the straight~ type before they choose which car to go for. Not that they're all cars -- the Hot Wheels series sports its fair share of vans, pickups and those silly RV cars that want to be a LandRover when they grow up -- and these tend to be neither too fast nor very good at big air tricks.   Luckily, the track design is very well balanced, so the big-ass Gulch Stepper wagon can make up for time by taking the special 4X4-only shortcuts that crop up at certain points. Speaking of tracks, it's worth noting that there are 12 of them in total, ranging over four fantasy worlds: Wild West, Glacial Rift, Haunted Highway, and Volcano Island. The track names are all straight  out of cuckoo-land, including the Command Center and Cold Fusion circuits, most of which are chock-full of jumping opportunities and twist and turn like snakes with appendicitis. Tracks loop, twist, soar skywards then plummet dramatically downward, cross ravines and end in  complete stops. Then there's the excellent Helicrash course, which features not only an amazing corkscrew section and huge iron double doors that slide open at the last second but at one point even auto-catapults you back the way you came, headlong into two-way traffic! Superb.   There are varying objectives for each of the courses: some based on points accumulation, others on hitting all the shortcuts and there's even a special playing mode called 'Airtime Challenge' where the most daring stunts earn the most points.   In essence, Hot Wheels takes the SF Rush concept  huge jumps and mid-air stunts  to a different level. Whereas with SF Rush  (not the crappy PS version, the N64 version) you pre-planned your jump and then hoped it worked out well, Hot Wheels players actually control the cars in mid-air. The real challenge is pulling off as many tricks, combos, and stunts as possible before you land. It's fun, but it's also really easy. The learning curve is short and the long-term play life is moderate. Taking cues from Beetle Adventure Racing, Hot Wheels is also packed with alternate courses and secrets. Here, it's still intriguing finding them all, but it doesn't feel as original or as compelling.  Graphics  Graphically, Hot Wheels goes out to impress with the tracks, and the cars are, I'm assured, modeled in great detail, faithful to the toys. That's all well and good, but doesn't help the fact that they've used a really garish color palette -- with the result that everything is a little too bright and in your face. Still, collectors of the model cars will instantly recognize all their favorites -- and now do something they'd never dream of doing with the real models -- send them flying,  spinning and crashing into the tracks and other vehicles at speeds that would wreck their collection in real life. The engine copes admirably with the speed, with no popup and several cars onscreen at once -- but then textures are very simple (bland even), mapped across some very  unrefined polygonal structures.  Sound To accompany your mid-air madness, EA has signed the usual motley crew of loud alt bands for the soundtrack, including Primus, Metallica (exclusive to the PlayStation version of the game), Meat Beat Manifesto, Mix Master Mike, Reverend Horton Heat and other such ridiculously-named DJs. Enough said, I think. Still overall, this music collection does go well with crash-and-burn racing.  Hot Wheels Turbo Racing is definitely one for the fans of the little metal car series, but the focus on mad tricks is fun. For a short while, anyway. If you've always wanted to see how your beloved toy cars would fare if you really did send them rocketing into the living room wall or whether they'd survive a 30-foot drop from the top of the local parking garage, I guess this is the game for you. If you wished SF Rush had more control and less randomness, then you'll love this. Hot Wheels does a little of everything pretty well, but doesn't execute everything well enough to remain a standout game for more than a month. Subtracting from the game's allure is its competition. A lot of racing games already exist on the PlayStation and it's hard to see why anyone but hardcore Hot Wheels aficionados would choose this over the likes of Driver, Rollcage, or even EA's own NFS games for driving thrills and spills. Die-cast demon driving with the emphasis on destruction - so don't expect to see the cool Ferrari models. Max Everingham (Medley Mixin' Max the Master Mover Man)", "date": "Sep 8, 1999"}
