And this week, that game is Sumo Wrestling from developer Mitsui.   Features:   10 challenges  Create-a-wrestler   Everybody knows what sumo wrestling is, even if it hasn't achieved the kind of world recognition of basketball or soccer. It's a contest of wills between two gigantic men who are determined to use their ample mass and a solid grasp of Newton's Laws to drive the other athlete out of the ring. Despite the size of the men, there is an incredible amount of grace to the sport, and nobody can ever denigrate the intense training and discipline required to be a champion.   Not that much of that really comes through in Sumo Wrestling. This is a very arcade-y slap fight that is occasionally broken up by grapples. Matches unfold in the proper sequence: Tachai, Koubou, and Kumi. Through these three phases, gamers will have to anticipate opponent's attempts to bully, slap, and ultimately slam you out of the ring. The controls are not nearly as complex as, say, Street Fighter, but they are very accessible. Much of the match is spent slamming on the ~action~ button to smack away your opponent's energy, but gamers that attempt button combos with the d-pad will discover some pretty sweet moves.   Sumo Wrestling includes a short, but satisfying build-a-wrestler mode where you customize everything from skin tone to mawashi color. (~Mawashis~ are the loincloth-y garments worn by sumo wrestlers.) The goal is to take your unknown wrestler through the ten-match tournament on aquest to become the yokozuna -- the grand champ of sumo.   For a simple little game, Sumo Wrestling's presenation pays great respect to the sport. Taiko drums are heard before a match. The official speaks in short Japanese phrases. The ring is surrounded by an audience decked out in the proper attire.  Sumo Wrestling is one of those great discoveries. It's not the world's deepest fighting game, but as a between-class or pre-meeting time killer, it's hard to beat. If you have any interest in the sport (maybe you watch it on ESPN 14), it's a recommended download. There are definitely worse way to add a few bucks to your phone bill.", "date": "Oct 8, 2004"}
