We're not talking about titles like Wii Sports, where the games are well made, entertaining, and  despite having an extremely simple style  are charming enough for anyone to enjoy.  What we really want to see is more titles like Game Party; products that took almost no time to make, offer sloppy controls, and have very little replay value after about ten minutes of repetitive (and oftentimes broken) motion control.   There's really no secret behind Game Party's motive.  Midway has done nothing to promote the game, and we don't blame them for that, as Wii's success is bound to bring on a wave of shovelware that most serious gamers have learned to completely ignore over the years.  Right now, some stay-at-home mom is juggling three kids at a Toys R Us, while simultaneously holding up Super Mario Galaxy and Game Party side-by-side.  She'll look between the two titles, glance at the price, and throw Game Party in the shopping cart.  There's the game's target audience.  We were about to ask for another Pong clone on Wii...  So what exactly does Game Party bring to the table?  You've got seven mini-games, each making use of Wii-mote only control, and most of which can be played trading off controllers amongst players.  The list includes Table Hockey, Hoop Shoot, Darts, Skill Ball (Skeeball), Ping Cup, Shuffleboard, and Trivia.  Each of the games is based off one core control, such as the classic hold/flick shooting in Hoop Shot found also in NBA Live, or the simple use of IR to control Table Hockey's pong-like experience; not a whole lot of depth.  Like Carnival Games, players can earn tickets after playing these games whether they win or lose. Unlike Carnival Games, however, there's no point in doing it, as the only extras in the game are new characters to play as.  You start with 125 to use, and 50 total to unlock.  Since there's no way you'll ever get through the 125 default avatars, ticket collection is a pretty moot point.   In fact, we're pretty sure most Wii owners (no matter the age) will tire of this game in about a half hour, flipping through each mini-game, playing it once or twice, and then moving on.  The title lacks any real style outside of a Mii rip-off which, again, doesn't allow you to use your own Miis, and each of the games lack any sort of polish, so there are strange frame issues in Skill Ball, quirks in the motion control in Hoop Shot, and playable  but sickeningly simple  IR control in Table Hockey.  Game Party makes Wii Play look like Mass Effect, and that's a horrible thought on all accounts.  In fact, we'd wholeheartedly recommend Carnival Games (given a 6.5 here at IGN) over Game Party to anyone that truly was looking for a mini-game experience for younger gamers, as it has far more to offer in depth, gameplay, customization, and entertainment value.  The wave of Wii shovelware has officially begun, and we dont see it letting up any time soon.  On the plus side, companies like Midway seem to have no misconceptions that titles like these are actually gunning for review scores over Wii Play, Wii Sports, and the like.  Game Party sits right along with the dozens upon dozens of titles out there that aim directly for ignorant shoppers; it's box art bait, plain and simple.  Do the games work?  Despite some odd control issues and annoying bugs, yes, they technically work.  Are they fun?  Not really, and the lack of polish can be infuriating.  There's no Mii integration, no real reason to replay the games (unless you want 175 playable characters instead of 125, and we know you do), and no single person on the planet - friend or enemy - that we'd recommend this one for.  If you're looking for a somewhat worthy design akin to Game Party, pick up Carnival Games, or go with something like Wii Play.  The former has a ton of customization and a decent style, while the latter includes a free controller along with your kick in the crotch.", "date": "Dec 12, 2007"}
