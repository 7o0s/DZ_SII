Pixel Dust Games, a newcomer to the mobile gaming space, has delivered its first game, a World War I aircraft blaster. The catch -- and there always is one -- is that it's a strategy game played on a board, complete with cards and dice.  Features:  Turn-based strategy game Action cutscenes  Aces of World War I is a surprise, twice-over. First, your eyebrows shoot up when you realize you just downloaded a strategy game, not an action game. Second, you're shocked (shocked!) to discover that Aces of World War I is actually a very clever, very playable strategy game - and you kinda forget about the expectations you had going into the whole affair.  The game is set up as a basic strategy game, mixed with a little Warlords action. You control either the Axis and the Allies, each team positioned on opposite ends of the board. Now, each team has two bases, surrounded by defensive anti-aircraft guns designed to ward off intrusions. But the main action is sending your six squadrons of fighter planes into the field to dogfight the enemy, and eventually, take the Axis bases.  Each turn begins with a roll of the dice. If you roll a six, you must move the full six spaces, even if that means you overshoot the enemy unit. If you do manage a roll that puts you in prime position to attack -- an adjacent square -- press ~select~ to engage. Depending on which square you're in, you unleash a different attack with varying results. For example, if you attack from the side, there's a chance you may miss -- but at least you won't encounter the return-fire of attacking head-on. If you attack from behind, you may score a direct-hit, but if your opponent has a ~roll~ card, they can maneuver behind you and return fire.  A roll ~card?~ Yes, card tactics also come into play Aces of World War I. Cards have a direct effect on the game itself, allowing for specific types of attacks and maneuvers in the sky. It adds a great level of strategy to the game, as you must carefully balance which cards you put into play.  Aces of World War I looks pretty solid. Pixel Dust has certainly made good use of color, as the brightly hued units stand out quite well against the brown board. The little in-game action scenes, seen when you engage the enemy, are nice diversions from the brown map screen. Unfortunately, this is a very, very quiet war. We were hoping for some rousing explosions, at least. Alas, zee Germans were equipped with muzzles and mufflers. Pixel Dust Games' Aces of World War Iis an excellent first effort from a fledgling development team. It demonstrates a full grasp of the limitations of the platform by taking great subject matter, and creating gameplay that suits a handset. Besides, with plenty of shooters out there and on the way, a well-done strategy game is more than appreciated.", "date": "Mar 17, 2004"}
