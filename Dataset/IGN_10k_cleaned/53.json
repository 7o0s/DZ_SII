The latest and most wordily-titled, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates takes place in the thousands of years before the setting of the Gamecube release. Fleshing out the Final Fantasy cannon's depth and breadth, Ring of Fates takes surface elements of the Final Fantasy series, such as key enemies, elemental magic, referred to as Magicite, and wraps it in a cutesy, candy-coated shell.   In the move to the DS platform, the multiplayer-centric gameplay has been made much more practical than the original. No longer must each player wield a Game Boy Advance tethered to a GC; the DS' Wi-Fi allows up to three other players to grab a bag of corn chips, a few cans of cola and get comfy for some entertaining dungeon crawling. However, unlike the original, Ring of Fates caters much more to those lonesome, single-player favouring gamers with a lengthy single-player storyline (thereby addressing one of the biggest issues with the original), tugging at the heartstrings and making the most of the DS' hardware.   Twin brother and sister, Yuri and Chelinka, live with their father in a snowy village in relative tranquillity. Of course, it doesn't take long for something to upset the apple-cart, rending their pop in twain and eventually driving Yuri to become a swordsman, while Chelinka, left a mute by magical means, works her mysterious skills with crystals and elements.      Combining two very separate control schemes into hectic combat is a lot to ask of younger gamers; in fact, it's one of the few points about the game that really suggest that Ring of Fates was designed with an older player in mind, despite the chibi-style art design and characters who all look like they're all of about eight years old  even the ones with beards. Disturbing.   Magicite, the central magical element in the game, is essentially disposable munitions. Attacking certain enemies or breaking open barrels and chests drops a handful of different varieties. I think they look like Dragon Balls, for what it's worth noting. In practice, you can either select the element of Magicite you want to cast from the lower screen with your thumb (forget trying to use a stylus, because you're going to be constantly changing characters, elements and options on there), or you can drop them into the world and physically place the coloured orb onto a stand or activation point. This is the basis for numerous puzzles, but the magic itself runs much deeper than this. Stacking magic is the key to unlocking stronger and stronger spells. Fire plus fire creates Fira, for instance, all the way up to creating strange blends of earth and water magic, lightning and so on.   It's a system that begs to be mastered  and again, it's not a casual-friendly experience, due to the hectic pace of the combat. Thankfully, the game provides plenty of instruction and guidance (and just enough save points  though, barely) to keep you from pulling hairs and wanting to tear the bouncing orbs off the top of every moogle you see.     Pathing and AI issues begin to surface as party combat becomes more frequent. The AI just isn't aggressive enough to be of much real use in heavy combat, attacking with all the gusto of a pacifist on a lazy afternoon stroll. That will frustrate you, since you're going to have to pick up the slack, constantly switching between characters to keep them healed up and alive. If they die, you can revive them, not with phoenix downs, but with Magicite. They also have a bad habit of not following you around the map; instead, you're going to be tapping the L button to magically transport the characters to your position. That's hilariously silly  how hard is it to get a character to stick behind you or follow in line?   The Map system is oddly lacking in polish too, It's the same size as the one on the main play screen, minus the transparency effects. It adds no additional geographical information such as height variance, and the lack of a zoom function is damned near sinful. Given the camera system is locked in place, you're going to wish you could get a better at-a-glance view of the world, but no.    As has been the case with just about every other 3D Square Enix release on the DS, Ring of Fates utterly smokes the competition in the presentation department. From the opening moments of the game, where you're taken a small town to a sprawling and bustling city, you'll marvel at the level of graphical sophistication on display. The character models are roundly impressive; easily twice as texturally striking and polygonally detailed as those in Final Fantasy III, for instance.    The landscape is dotted with minute details like sprite grass and atmospheric effects like rolling clouds, sweeping dust and snow. As the lightning flashes and the rain pours down, you'll swear this is running on PSX. Impressively, key cutscenes are also fully voice-acted in English. While the actors cast in each part do their best with some wordy and often confounding and obtuse dialogue, you'll wish there was an option to mute the squeaky, throaty babble, or at least reduce it back to the standard bleeps and bloops of minor dialogue exchanges. The music is excellent throughout; fans of the series will pick up on many similarities in these compositions to those of the core Final Fantasy games.   Stunning stuff for DS. Square Enix, can you please teach other developers how to make pretty, fun games?  While you can't take three mates with you through the storyline, the multiplayer maps are taken from the single-player game. These are all slightly tweaked to give additional challenge, but be forewarned  the framerate does slip up frequently when rendering more than four characters on-screen at once. Factor in a burst of magic or a few Magicite spheres, and the framerate gets choppier than a stolen BMW.    With all the attention given to the story, setting and presentation, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates tends to slip up in the fundamental gameplay department. Things like AI and cluttered controls will test your patience, but never enough to sour the experience or remove the sheen of quality. This is another solid effort from Square Enix  one that actually gets surprisingly dark as it goes on. With a few unlockable bonus modes, tremendous item creation depth and a combat system that caters to hardcore FF fans, there's more to Rings of Fate than the childish presentation suggests.", "date": "Mar 19, 2008"}
