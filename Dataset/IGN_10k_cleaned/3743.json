In SX Superstar, you can become, oddly enough, a supercross superstar. This Jeremy McGrath sequel sans the Jeremy McGrath licensing hopes to take you from fledgling amateur rider to the pro circuit. The question is, do you or does SX have what it takes to become a superstar?   Gameplay  While SX Superstar lacks the Jeremy McGrath license, it also happily cuts out the extreme sport collectathons so prevalent in extreme sports titles. Instead, Superstar is, simply, an arcade racer. Modes are a slim selection of Arcade (essentially Quick Race), Championship, and Multiplayer. By focusing solely on racing elements instead of trying to come up with a game to compete with the established Tony Hawk and its dime a dozen followers, we should see one top notch arcade racer. Acclaim has pumped Superstar full of bikes, speed, big air, and stuntswhat's not to love?   Unfortunately, there is a lot that is wrong in the world of SX Superstar. It's great that Superstar incorporates not only the racing elements, both outdoor supercross and Baja, and stunts that are recognizable to any fan, but goes beyond in an attempt to simulate the life of a SX superstar. While the intentions were good, the actual execution is a foul mess.   As with any racer, the bulk of SX Superstar can be found in the Championship mode. Of course, there's a slight twist to the typical career mode. Not only are you moving through the ranks from amateur to pro circuits and managing sponsors, you also are trying to get enough cash to upgrade you digs, your bike, and your girlfriend.   When you start out, you're in a crappy little apartment whose last tenet was apparently murdered. You've got no cash, a girlfriend that looks like a man, and only a bike (Ted's Tiny 125 cc) and a dream of going pro to get you the hell out of there. So, with the support of your parents, you enter the amateur supercross circuit. As you advance through the season, you win cash prizes, get sponsorship offers, trade-in your girl for one that'd make your mother proud, and hopefully finish the season in first so you can move on to the semi-pro and pro circuits.     With each successful season (you have to finish in first), you move up a circuit and your apartment gets upgraded. You start earning more cash, get asked to invitational events, and have the means to upgrade to a faster bike. If you're the inquisitive type, you might be wondering how deep this simulation goes. Do you get to pick out your new apartment? Can you choose your girlfriend? This is a mere shell of a simulation. The most interaction you have with the ~lifestyle~ aspect is choosing whether to accept sponsor deals or whether to buy a new bike.   Not only are your options limited, especially with only four bikes in each of the three classes to choose from and your girlfriend is represented by a picture on your coffee table, you also spend half your time playing fax machine simulator. Simulating real life, you get to check your fax machine for offers, and your answering machine for messages. What fun!    Your mom or dad will call to tell you how proud they are of you, your mechanic will warn you that someone suspicious was sneaking around the garage, ex-girlfriends will yell and new ones will tell you how awesome you are, and buddies will invite you out to parties. The odd thing is that you listen to all this conversationfor absolutely no reason. You can't call them back with a prefabricated message. The messages don't affect any part of your racing life. There aren't even enough of them to make it through the game without hearing the same thing over and over again.    Since SX Superstar is the first game to attempt to simulate the SX rider lifestyle, you can't expect everything to be perfect. Even if the simulation aspects are tedious, pointless, and annoying, these shortcomings can be excused as long as they get the core gameplay right.    As you might have guessed, they didn't exactly sink the putt. Wrapped into a scraggily ball of arcade action is a shoddy physics system, questionable AI, and an almost unusable stunt system. Arcade games are supposed to border on realism. You are supposed to be able to pick up the game and maneuver your racer around the track with little worry of real world physics (as in he goes where you direct him). However, while arcade games often capitalize off the fantastical, it still needs to be grounded somewhere in the plausible.    The first thing you'll notice when you pick up SX is that the game is slow. If you're stuck on a 125cc bike it feels like the whole course has been doused in a mixture of sap, tar, and molasses. While all the bikes feel slow, if you've been playing with the 125cc for a while and then upgrade to a 250cc or 500cc bike you will notice a definite increase in speed, but you're on a bike - 60mph should feel fast.   While steering is fairly responsive, and you can even spinout coming out of a powerslide, bike handling is wacky at times. For instance, there isn't a way to successfully pull of a wheelie. Your options are to drive normally or fall onto your back. The vertical orientation of your bike is so finicky that it can even be difficult to land some jumps (you will crash for unapparent reasons). Water also has no effect on your bike's physics. Drive in the rain, up a stream, or through the ocean and your bike will handle as solidly as it does on dirt.    What play's a much bigger role in your building SX Superstar frustration level is the stunt system. It is almost impossible to execute a stunt, let alone link combos together to rack up points. Besides for just being a fun addition (theoretically) to pull Can-Cans or Supermans off jumps, in SX successful stunts give you points that translate into a nitro speed boost. While you rarely will ever encounter the need for speed boosts, except in multiplayer races, it would be nice that if you could capitalize from a built in system.   It isn't the lack of stunts (there are 24) that hurts so badly, but rather the fact that even the massive amounts of air that you can get off some jumps is rarely enough time to successfully point left or right. SX gives you no way to perceive whether you'll have enough time to do the move because even if you get enough height, there is such a delay between the time you press one of the stunt buttons (B or Y) that you usually don't start the motions until you are about to hit the ground. To remedy this is the art of preloading. By holding down the left trigger as you go up a jump, you can preload the jump (get more air). This gives you ample airspace to maneuver in, except that when you do preload, the camera pulls away from the rider (in affect, stretching out the picture). This distorts the ground enough to hinder landings (you still crash). While thanks to preloading you may have actually completed a Rodeo, you have little hope of actually landing it.    This all makes the few optional stunt events rather painful to participate in because getting huge combos is near impossible. To make matters worse, if you fail to land, you get reset on, or right before the jump, meaning that you're likely crash again. This leads to a whole lot of lost time and not a whole lot of fun.   If these problems aren't determent enough, a questionable AI rounds out this spectacle. While Championship mode is the main game mode, you can plow through it in a matter of hours if you happen to be good at it. All it takes is finishing first in a season to advance to the next circuit, and with only three circuits this can be all too short a ride to superstardom. Unfortunately, you don't have to be a SX superstar to best the AI. If you happen to get hold of first place, it's possible to crash upwards of four times before you'll be overtaken. Also, on numerous occasions, I found myself trailing behind the guy in first. The AI racer almost always crashed at the last minute allowing me to snatch first place.   Although there are twenty different tracks in locals such as the USA, UK, Egypt, Jamaica, and Italy, most of them feel distinctly similar, especially the Baja courses that are often remixed versions of each other. Besides for what feels like a lack of variety in the actual course design, they all have their fair share of jumps and turns to make for an exciting SX adventure. Surprise, surprise, there are still problems to be had.    The two race types in question are the normal circuit races and the Baja courses. The stunt courses are actually quite well laid out, the only problem is the chore of performing stunts. What you need to watch out for in circuit races are course outs. The boundaries arbitrarily marked by paint in some courses, but most of the time the tracks are fairly undefined. However, if you cross a millimeter over a certain invisible line, course out will flash on your screen. You have three seconds to get back on the course, but usually since you don't realize you're not on the course, or where the course is per se, you'll be reset.     The Baja races suffer from a different problem. These courses have virtually no boundaries, but you must go through checkpoints in  a specific order. Since there are a number of paths you could possibly take, its up to a little green arrow to guide you in the correct direction. However, the arrow points you towards the next checkpointnot the road you need to take to get there. This means you'll find yourself having to turn around and retrace your path.    Multiplayer  Multiplayer in SX Superstar is essentially the same as the Arcade mode except you get to race against a friend. While there won't be any computer-controlled players on the course, you do have all the tracks, riders, and bikes at your disposal that you have in arcade mode. Multiplayer also looks exactly like the single player game. The graphics are the same, the draw distance isn't noticeably shorter, and there isn't any slowdown. If it weren't for the game's built in flaws, multiplayer races would be a blast.    Graphics  SX Superstar wins no awards for beauty. The in-game graphics not only appear washed out, but also are fairly bland and simplistic. While the riders and bikes are detailed, everything elseisn't. Dirt and sand tracks look incredibly smooth. Where are the bumpy, churned up courses you see in the X Games? While some level of bumpiness would have been appreciated, I can live without it. Invisible walls that you can slam into on the sides of courses are not so forgivable. Not only will you notice flat trees and other backgrounds, but also you can make out the ~invisible~ walls by a sporadic line of flat trees and rocks that appears in front of the actual background image.   The most interesting part of Acclaim's graphical decisions is the partial use of particle effects. Sometimes you'll see a cloud of dust rise from behind your bike and when you drive through water, lines will appear behind your rear tire. Come on! You're racing on dirt, why don't I see dirt kicked up by the rear tire, especially on power slides? Why doesn't water splash when you land in an ocean of it?   Collision detection also has its own bouts with mediocrity. While for the most part you don't run into problems, you will occasionally see your foot go through the ground as you lean into turns. Also, running into AI while they're riding won't knock you over, it's only while they are on the ground that they'll send you flying to the dirt.    Sound  While the sound effects found in SX Superstar are extremely generic such as revving engines and squealing tires, they are usually drowned out by an above average, if repetitive, soundtrack. It's the kind of music you'd expect from any of the extreme sports games, and actually improves the overall game experience. Apollo Four Forty, Pitchshifter, Jimmie's Chicken Shack, Box Car Racer, No Use For A Name, 28 Days, Fenix TX, Orange 9MM, N.E.R.D., and The Deftones provide the musical talent. Not only are they bands that I've heard of, but the selected tracks are enjoyable to listen to for the first dozen times you hear them. Good initial track listings aside, this is the kind of game that could take advantage of custom soundtracks.  I have little left to say that wasnt mentioned in this review. Lets just say this is equivalent to Jeremy McGrath showing up to the party two years later. Theoretically, I should love SX Superstar. Its an arcade racer that offers lots of air and a stunt system. SX even has a lifestyle simulator, which could have been interesting if you actually made decisions about your lifestyle instead of listening to answering machine messages. The problem is that with so many shortcomings, SX Superstar has to entice you into playing it with, and what little there is just isnt all that fun.", "date": "Jun 25, 2003"}
