{"name": "V-Rally / Checkered Flag", "name_review": "V-Rally 3", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/10/28/v-rally-3-2", "text": "gained notoriety in the Game Boy Advance community way before its US release, as it was literally the first texture-mapped 3D racer in the works for the Nintendo handheld. And it's finally here...well, after it was released in Europe about a month ahead of us. The game is visually incredible for the Game Boy Advance, showing off to the GBA market what the system can pull off, 3D-wise. V-Rally 3 is a fun and solid racer, too, but it's clear that the priority in this GBA project was its graphics. Features Rally and Rally Cross modes 10 different racing teams Seven different racing locations Cartridge save (two slots) Link cable mode for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  As a Rally game, V-Rally 3 is a thorough design. For the Rally Racing purists, V-Rally 3 features at least seven different world locations, each with five different legs of track to race across. Each location has its own road racing conditions, from tarmac to gravel to rain-slickened pavement to the downright nasty snow-covered surfaces, and before heading out to the track players will have to adjust their car's settings to match the conditions. For folks who just want to race against other vehicles, there's a Rally Cross option that gives players the ability to compete against three computer-controlled cars on six different tracks (each track is reversed the second time around). The interface in altering the car's attributes is clean and informative, the menu system being much more intuitive and pleasant to look at than the one that Spellbound and Ubi Soft laid out for Colin McRae 2.0.   In fact, that's exactly what this game does right: looks. The graphic engine is indeed a stunning sight to watch on the Game Boy Advance hardware. V-Rally 3 for the GBA was developed by the same internal Infogrames team that pulled off some of the sweet behind-the-vehicle racers on the 8-bit Game Boy Color system, including Wacky Races and, of course, V-Rally 2. With the more powerful GBA hardware, this development team really went to town and pulled of a 3D engine that looks like something  development studios were pulling off in the first year of the PlayStation's life. Environments are fully 3D with decently textured surfaces, letting the designers go nuts with realistic course layout; sloping hills, varying turns, cliffsides, bridges, and tunnels are all part of the game's seven different locations. This 3D engine also means that players can turn around and go the other direction if they wanted to...but there's no reason for this, so don't do it. Vehicles, however, are more limited in this engine; cars are pre-rendered sprites that are drawn at several different angles to represent a solid object. With all this in place, the framerate is acceptably smooth and keeps its pace with barely any drops when the speed of the game picks up or the geometry of the area gets more detailed.  But it's obvious that the game's graphics were number one on the V-Rally 3 design document, because as solid as the racing is, it's not nearly as challenging as it should be. The first season is almost a complete joke, requiring only the basics of driving skill to come in first against the rest of the pack. The opponents' lap times are not tuned very well for the ~average~ racer, since in the first season it's normal to beat the second racer in the pack by more than a minute...and when a location takes only about 12 minutes to get through, a minute is way too much extra time. It's like racing a marathon and beating the second-place winner by an hour and a half. That just doesn't happen. In the second season, it's a little more fair...times are balanced a bit more tightly. But you'll have to endure almost two hours of cakewalk racing to get to the actual challenge. Driving skill isn't quite a requirement in this game, either, since in 90% of the game's tracks you can just mash down on the gas without fear of slamming into anything. You cannot spin out or flip your vehicle, and even though your car has a reverse gear, you'll never use it. Ever.  And as excellent as the graphic engine is, there are certain elements that go on in V-Rally 3 that make the game a bit annoying to play. First of all, each of the game's tracks are lined by an invisible wall that begins about five pixels from the edge of the track. Which means that your car will ~thunk~ against nothing if it gets too far off-road, even though it has plenty of clearance between the track and the roadside obstacles. Second, racing in the Rally Cross, you'll notice that the opponent cars have an extreme advantage due to the horrible collision detection; if you bump a car on its rear, that collision will slow you down. No problem. However, if a car bumps you from the rear, you'll slow down...and he'll just drive right on through as if your vehicle was made from vapor. And just to be nitpicky, the 3D engine has a hard time with object priorities...you'll actually see the other racers through cliffsides and hills simply because the engine didn't know to remove them from sight.  The game has a cartridge save, but it doesn't put it to good use. All it does is record the player's progress when an entire location is complete. Basically, players must play through all five legs of a race before they can put the game down. Also, the game doesn't record best times on a specific track, which is unfortunate because in V-Rally 3 players can pull up their best lap's ghost racer during the time trial mode...it would have been excellent if these ghost racers could be recorded for future reference. As awesome as V-Rally 3 looks, it doesn't impress quite as much in the playability department. 3D graphics can only take a game so far, and while this game is a decent racer, it just can't come close to how well Ubi Soft's Colin McRae Rally 2.0 drives on the GBA. The game attempts to be a rally simulator, but ends up being more of an arcade-style racer because there's little technique necessary in getting through the locations' challenges. But if you're looking to see what your GBA is able to do graphically, V-Rally 3 will definitely wow you with its visuals.", "date": "Oct 28, 2002"}
