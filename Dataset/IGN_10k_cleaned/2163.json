Give gamers the classic falling block puzzle game and most will be happy since everybody ends up playing the simple-but-insanely-addictive original design over the zillion variations anyway. THQ's Tetris Worlds isn't a bad version of Tetris by any stretch. But it's severely lacking on the Game Boy Advance when compared to the Nintendo-released Tetris DX on the Game Boy Color...a game which is still being sold for the system and 100% compatible with the Game Boy Advance. Why pick up Tetris Worlds when Tetris DX can be had for a few bucks cheaper? THQ doesn't do much to sway the audience to its version, that's for sure. Features Six variations of Tetris Two modes of play Link cable support for two players Only for Game Boy Advance  Tetris, for the unfamiliar (and shame on you if you are), is a fast-paced action-puzzle game where the object is to rotate and fit different shaped pieces (known as Tetrinominos since they're constructed of four tiles in differing configurations) to form a solid, uninterrupted horizontal line. When this happens, the line will disappear, letting the rest of the pile settle into the bin. A maximum of four horizontal lines can be constructed...and this is considered a ~Tetris.~ The game continues, increasing in speed until the bin fills to the top, ending the game. It's a simple idea, but it's the original puzzle game that's been mimicked by other puzzle designers, and has been brought to nearly every system available, officially or not.  THQ's rendition, Tetris Worlds offers several variations of the original Tetris theme. Of course, the company includes the classic version to appease the Tetris fans who want to do nothing more than to simply zone out with the basic design. The other variations include Sticky Tetris, where tiles of the same color stick together, but the others do not...creating a chain reaction if the player's mind is alert. Fusion Tetris is a simple matter of hacking away at random tiles in the bin until a flashing tile is removed. Hotline Tetris challenges players to remove tiles on drawn lines of specific heights...the higher the line, the more points are removed from the required goal quota. Square Tetris requires a keen mind, as it requires players to form 4x4 tile squares (which solidify) and remove them from play to reach the required goal. And Cascade Tetris is similar to Sticky Tetris, but pieces don't glue together -- they break apart and fall into gaps to create combos, removing lines as the smaller pieces settle into place.  This all sounds great, but then you realize one big problem: no battery. Almost every version of Tetris released had a way to record your best scores, challenging you to beat the highest Tetris session in the game. Without battery, nothing is saved, not even the changes you make to the options menu...since you'll most likely want to turn on or off certain functions like the ~cheat~ shadow for novices or the new piece swap that's just too convenient for its own good. So, every time you turn the system on to play, you'll have to enter the options menu to tweak what you've already tweaked before. Tetris DX has a battery. This one should, too.  A battery would have also increased the enjoyment of the game, since the developers could have hidden the variations of Tetris available right from the get-go in this package. This would have given a sense of accomplishment to gamers as they'd ~unlock~ the extra variations the more they played Tetris Worlds.  The rest of the package is incredibly no-frills as well, with poorly rendered and animated backgrounds to complement the action of the puzzle game, and not-so-enjoyable music that actually crackles during play. The game does feature two player link play, but it requires an additional cartridge to take advantage of it. During the development of Tetris Worlds we actually received a version in progress with a single cartridge link feature...but somewhere down the line it was pulled from the package. Odd how that works.  If this game happened to be the only Tetris package available to Game Boy Advance owners, I'd actually recommend a purchase...even with the lack of a battery. But bless that backward-compatible feature of the GBA -- since Nintendo still manufactures and sells a greatly superior version of the game, Tetris fanatics (and those still new to the idea) should grab a copy of the original 8-bit rendition. Sure, it won't take advantage of the GBA's advanced capabilities...but then again, neither does Tetris Worlds", "date": "Oct 12, 2001"}
