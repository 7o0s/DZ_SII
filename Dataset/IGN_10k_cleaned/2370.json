Despite this rather lengthy delay, Max Payne lived up to all the hype, showcasing great graphic style, cool cinematics, excellent camera control, and lots and lots of bullets that John Woo would definitely approve of.  Max Payne is all action, all the time and Xbox owners will be glad to know the title has been ported to the Xbox faithfully; although there are no new features added to the Xbox version, Max Payne on the Xbox is visually as impressive as it was on the PC.  Combine good controls and the addictive gameplay of the title and X-heads will definitely want to experience some Payne this holiday season.  The story behind Max Payne is a pretty dark one; a former NYPD cop, Payne comes home after work to find his family murdered by several drug junkies.  After delivering swift and bloody justice to these drugged-up punks, Max Payne joins the DEA as an undercover agent to hunt down those responsible for the distribution of the drug, Valkyr.  After only a few minutes into the game and after several bloody gunfights, Max Payne finds himself not only the target of the mafia, but also of the police.  So, like any cornered beast with nothing left to live for, Payne makes it his personal business to put those dealing the Valkyr drug permanently out of business.  The story is driven by in-game cut sequences and comic book-like story board sequences that are very well written and certainly keep the dark aura of this game.  Storytelling and pacing are excellent, an added bonus to the excellent graphics and gameplay.  All the action in Max Payne is delivered in the third person perspective.  Although we've seen a few good third person perspective shooters, the camera control in Max Payne has to be one of the best.  There are a few areas where the camera can be a bit of a problem, but for the most part viewing the action is a piece of cake, especially since you control where you're looking with the Right Analog stick.  Visuals are nearly identical to the PC version of Max Payne; there might be a little less detail in some ground textures, but you really have to look for those differences.  There's great detail and nice reflective textures throughout the game; I really like how you can totally damage walls and other objects with hundreds of bullet holes that actually stay on the wall.  There's only one annoying tidbit and that's aimed at the frame rate; occasionally, it fluctuates between 30 and 60 depending on how intense the action and how many enemies can be seen on the screen.  It's hardly a big deal and when using the bullet time feature, you'll never notice frame rate at all.  Beyond the blazing gunplay action and light puzzle elements, the meat of Max Payne's gameplay revolves around the use of bullet time.  Although you don't have to use bullet time to engage enemies, the use of bullet time slows down the actions of the enemies and all your movements except for aiming.  Plus, it just looks damn cool when you dive with double Ingrams submachine guns bullets spewing from the muzzle.  More than just a gimmick, the use of bullet time can really get you through a jam especially in the later levels where you'll encounter enemies with better firepower and better aim than earlier henchmen.  You can't engage bullet time all the time; an hourglass measures how much bullet time you have so it becomes a bit of a strategy in rationing when you should use bullet time.  Of course, it also helps when Payne is armed with Desert Eagles, two Berretas, pump-action shotguns, Ingram submachine guns, grenades, and sniper rifles.  Again, as mindless as it seems when you're armed to the teeth with this much firepower, there's strategy in using the weapons depending on the situation.  While the shotgun has great stopping power, it's only effective at mid to close range and it's slow recoil timed can make gunfights with lots of thugs a big problem.  Obviously, the Ingram submachine guns are great at any range and deal death quickly to your foes, but it runs out of ammunition rapidly.  Knowledge of what weapons to use combined with adequate use of bullet time is essential to learn when proceeding further into the game.  Thankfully, Payne can search areas to find more ammo and the ever-important painkillers to replenish his health.  The ability to interact and explore the world of Max Payne really immerses the player, and you'll find yourself opening every cabinet, every desk drawer, or bashing open boxes in the hope of find items to aid your quest.  The amount of detail that went into this game is really nice - I especially like the response from Payne when you shoot out the really annoying bank alarm system in an early sequence of the game.  Another big pleasure is the sound quality.  The sound effects are top-notch and it becomes a pretty important aspect of the game.  You'll be able to recognize what weapons enemies have by the distinctive sound of their weapons; nothing is scarier than hearing the unique sound of a grenade bouncing on the ground near Payne and you frantically trying to find it.  Background music really adds to the setting spiking at the proper moments of intense action.  The voices are pretty well-done although they might be a bit cliched; Payne himself is a weird mix of Clint Eastwood, Mickey Rourke, and any other ~anti-hero~ we've seen on film.  Max Payne is definitely best played with a good stereo surround system.  For all the heaps of praise we have for Max Payne, there are certain things that bother me.  There are two sequences that were extremely aggravating; I won't mention any specifics so as not to ruin your experience but let's just say Max Payne is made to be an action game, NOT a platformer.  The enemy AI is aggressive and sometimes it has this uncanny ability to ~predict~ where you are; I'm all for tough AI, but when I can't see the enemy and a thug tosses a grenade right at my feet, that kinda - for lack of a better word - sucks.  Load times are pretty short for the most part, but the Xbox version loads each chapter frequently - while the PC version would load nearly the whole chapter at the beginning, the Xbox breaks up the loading durations to several small parts throughout the chapter.  They're short, but they can break up the flow of a game right when it begins to get interesting.    There's nothing added to Max Payne in terms of new features.  I don't know what could've been added and as good a PC port of it is, there should be at least some extra features; perhaps some of the more common customized levels created by players from the PC version (for your info, Xbox version of Max Payne has no level editor). Finally, the game is pretty short; a decent player can run through the game between 10-12 hours.  Of course, that's 10-12 hours of bullet ridden, shotgun loading, grenade tossing, lead pipe whacking, double gun wielding, fast reloading, pinpoint sniping, time stopping, third person shooting action.  In short, get Max Payne.  --Anthony Chau, IGN", "date": "Dec 11, 2001"}
