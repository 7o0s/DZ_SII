{"name": "Amplitude: P.O.D. Special Edition", "name_review": "Amplitude: P.O.D. Special Addition", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/11/amplitude-pod-special-addition", "text": "Although it's still a small community relative to, say, another Sony game, Gran Turismo, Harmonix's twin set of deep music rhythm games, FreQuency and Amplitude have carved out a wide fan base who genuinely love these games. The word ~love~ may even be too soft. Sonically illuminated might be a better fit.    It's different being addicted to a rhythmic music game than say WWE SmackDown: Here Comes the Pain. For one, Amplitude is cool, as in chill cool. The psychedelic animated backgrounds and huge selection of songs put people in more of a zone, elevate them to a different place than the head-bangers who love to swear and spit at each other. And so, as part of its ongoing drive to fuse music, games and movies, SCEA has bundled a single, exclusive level of Amplitude in the latest album from P.O.D.'s ~Payable Upon Death.~    Using the same interface, music and options from Amplitude, SCEA has basically given P.O.D. fans a taste of the second Harmonix title in one song. The tune ~Space~ is an exclusive second disc contained in the album jewel case. If you want to hear it, you must play it too. Kind of a sneaky trick, but also a very shrewd way to get people play the game.    P.O.D.'S ~Space~, like the rest of the album, is a hybrid of thrash funk and metal, which easily fits into the more mainstream collection of Amplitude songs. It's catchy, embroidered with loud harsh vocals and it makes for a good Amplitude song (though, I admit, it's not my taste in music at all).   The gameplay is exactly like that in Amplitude, so it's got all the upgrades from Frequency -- from the new ship itself to the hub city and the groovy loading music. All the options required for one song, that is, which limits things quite a bit. But what really do you need for one song? You get the chance to play the game on a PS2, save the file, and switch from easy to insane difficulty levels (four in all), with the option to restart or quit in the midst of a game.    Using your PS2 shoulder buttons (L1, R1 and R2), players switch from track to track following the isolated threads of music, whether they're drums, base, vocals, keyboards or guitar, in a Simon Says-style format, while a base level of the tune plays in the background. The key is to not miss a beat and to link the tracks for the highest combinations and points.    A single powerup (Autoblaster) has been retained, I guess because SCEA figured most people wouldn't know what to do with six or more. Lacking the other half dozen powerups and a bevy of songs, this single-level demo can be played and beaten in less than 10 minutes. So, it's not like you should buy the album for a huge new bonus pack. No no no.    So, this one-song demo is a quirky little niche dealio. Fans of Amplitude and of P.O.D. will definitely like this bundle. Will anyone else? Maybe fans of P.O.D. will enjoy this brief taste of Amplitude enough to buy the full PS2 game. Anything can happen.Reviewing a single demo disc is an odd thing. This special edition retains all of the stylings, looks, and most benefits from the original Amplitude, but it's only one song. So, really instead of being a add-on, it should be looked at as a gift from SCEA to P.O.D. fans. Cause they're pretty much the only folks who will ever see it. Thus, I have retained most of the scores from the original review of Amplitude and have lowered the gameplay, replay value and overall score. It's a good little demo, but it's only that. For the real thing, get FreQuency or Amplitude for the real full deal.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
