The 2D adventure was universally considered to be a classic story of good versus evil, with the player wielding the Mana Sword to seal away Mana seeds and restore peace to the land.  Obviously, a sequel that lived up to this adventure had a huge mountain of expectations to climb.  It also needed to stand out to from the previous title or it would come across as a pale imitation of the Super NES game.  Well, it's taken almost fifteen years, but the first true sequel in the Mana series has been released in the form of Dawn of Mana.  But is the 3D third person action RPG worthy of the franchise?   A prequel to Secret of Mana, the story behind Dawn of Mana unfolds thanks to a group of spirits that gather together on a special night to recount an ancient tale about a young man that possessed the Sword of Mana, and the young woman that became the Goddess of Mana.  This story took place long before humans knew about magic in a land called Illusia.  Believed to be holy because it held the Tree of Mana, Illusia held small villages of tree folk and scattered tribes.  It was also surrounded by five contentious lands that held a tentative truce with one another, until one day, the King of Lorimar and his golem soldiers invaded Illusia.  By kidnapping a Tree Maiden named Ritzia, he wanted to unlock the power of the Tree of Mana to open a door to an evil realm and plunge the entire world into darkness.   Hey listen!  A tree is falling in the forest! Over the course of a Prologue and 8 chapters, players take on the role of Keldric (or Keldy), Ritzia's childhood friend who's eagerly trying to rescue her from her captors before her mystical abilities can be used for ill.  Fortunately at the beginning of the game, Keldy manages to enlist the help of Faye, a young spirit child that casts stat boosting magic. He also finds a magical artifact that embeds a splinter of the Tree of Mana into his right arm, turning it into a vine sword. This vine can be shot into an opponent, wrapping them up and allowing Keldy to swing the enemy into other monsters.  While it causes minor amounts of damage, it allows Keldy to use his most effective weapon: Panic.  By sending an object crashing into or near a monster, he can cause even the largest beast to freak out, paralyzing them with fear or forcing them to run in circles.  Once stunned in this manner, they are prevented from attacking, which allows players to freely attack them at will and cause additional damage.   The other benefit to panicking monsters is that it forces them to drop coins, health and magic power-ups, which is the only way that you can power up Keldric and Faye, making them more effective in battle.  These items help extend Keldy's health along with providing Faye with new spells and magic points that she can use in battle.  Unfortunately, the character development system is screwed up, so you're not really going to be interested in really building up either character.  The highest level that you can build up either character is Level Four, but since your level constantly resets when you reach the next chapter, you've got to slog through rebuilding and reacquiring your abilities all over again, which is simply annoying.  What's more, since there are no towns or shopkeepers in a chapter and there's no inventory for Keldy, you'll usually wind up having uneven development of one character or another.  More often than not, you'll find more attack and health power-ups than magic boosts, so Keldy will be maxed out while Faye is literally an afterthought.   Keldy tries to put down some flower power against the Lorimar King. Melee attacks aren't the only way that Keldy can dispatch enemies. He can use a slingshot to fire pebbles at enemies from a distance.  For the most part, these basic pebbles are weak, only stripping away a point or two of damage per hit. However, Keldy and Faye can find spirit-infused totems that impart special powers into rocks.  Some of these affect individual targets, such as setting a monster on fire, while others will impart an area effect, like putting groups of enemies to sleep.  To maximize your firepower, Keldy can target lock an enemy, so every projectile, melee attack and shoved destructible item like boxes and barrels will be sent in their direction.  However, the targeting can really be hit or miss within Dawn of Mana -- it will rarely lock onto an immediate threat, and will often lock onto some creature in the distance when you're focusing on a beast in the foreground.  It's even shoddier when you're trying to push an object into a group, because it has a tendency to slip off the item or select something you're not interacting with.  After a few instances of this, you'll quickly abandon the target lock for visibly aiming and firing or pushing projectiles.    The same can be said for the generic in-game radar at the upper right side of the screen.  Everything on the radar is broken out into different colored boxes: flashing yellow squares are the goals for a stage, white are allies and red are enemies.  Blue boxes (which are the majority of items on the radar) are objects or enemies that will probably yield items.  While blue and red enemies aren't clearly delineated (many blue monsters won't give anything while reds will), the other serious issue with the radar is that it doesn't provide a sense of scale or distance from your current position to these enemies.  As a result, you will easily find yourself lost if you attempt to follow the mini-map at all, especially since all of these boxes, save the goal, will respawn after a few minutes.  That's right, you can't actually clear out a stage of its opponents, nor can you set up a marker to help you navigate the gigantic environments.  Even though there's a directional arrow that will pop up if you stand still, it's on a flat plane, so you won't have an idea that you need to climb an obstacle, trigger a switch, break some object or other platforming feat until you stumble onto it.   This is particularly frustrating when you consider that your progress is continually evaluated as you move through stages and eventually the entire chapter.  Not only are you judged by how fast you make your way through the map, you're evaluated on other items like how many enemies you killed, how many objects you smashed and how many coins you collected.  Depending on how you did, you'll receive a grade, such as S, A, B, etc., with S being the best one possible. This isn't just a letter grade to make you feel good, since it also unlocks emblems which can be used to impart special abilities to Keldy, such as a larger attack range, more health or stronger blows with his sword.  There are 60 different emblems that you can acquire, and since some of them are tied to the four difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard and ultimate), there should be plenty of items and plenty of replayabilty for players that feel the need to collect everything when they're playing a game.   Get ready to take on big and small enemies alike, just don't target lock them. However, there's a few restrictions that will crop up when it comes to the emblems and collection that even tarnishes this setup.  For one, you can only equip a few of them at a time and you can only equip them at the start of a chapter.  You're not allowed to change emblems mid-chapter, so if you make a mistake, you're pretty much stuck until you complete that chapter.  Similarly, you won't be able to access some of the emblems unless you quit the game and access the shop within the Battle Arena, which is only available when you complete chapter three.  Here, players can battle random groups of monsters in confined spaces for additional money and points.  You can also purchase and unlock items, but you can only access this section outside of the actual story of the game.  As a result, this area feels like a ~mini-game~ that's removed from the overall story and unimportant to the rest of the title.   It's a shame, because the game does manage to squeeze some impressive technical feats out of the PS2.  Thanks to Dawn of Mana's use of Havok to power the physics behind every object and character model in the game, it's possible to hurl items in the game world with an accurate sense of weight and momentum.  This means that it'll be much easier to toss a box or a barrel than it will be to fling a log, but they'll spin and tumble down inclines in a realistic manner.  The physics can be taken to an extreme, however; especially when enemies you're attacking go flying because of some boulder or rock thrown into them.  The same can be said for Keldy, who can easily be bounced back and forth between monsters like a pinball if they launch their attacks at the right time. This can highlight another problem, which is that the camera for the game can be atrocious.  Targeting can cause the camera to swing around wildly, just as getting smacked by a large opponent and thrown backwards can confuse the tracking for the game.  Thanks to the tight zoom on Keldy, it can also get blocked by various environmental objects, which can suck when you're being attacked from multiple sides but can't see where they're coming from.  While you can adjust the camera so you're not blocked, you can't adjust the zoom, so don't ever expect to pull back to get a good sense of where an enemy is or how high a platform you need to jump to might be placed.     Tossing flaming bales of hay might start forest fires, but it's fun. It's unfortunate because the 3D environments are nice and feature a ton of objects to interact with as well as an impressive sense of scale.  There's a variety of locations, including forests, underground caves, ruins and beach settings, and quite a bit to look at, such as grass blowing in the wind or waterfalls pouring into rivers and streams.  Character models are quite detailed, and when you put Keldy up against one of the large bosses that often fill the screen, you really get sense of a huge battle that you're fighting in your quest to save Ritzia.  The voice acting is pretty good as well, with everyone from Keldy to the King of Lorimar delivering solid performances.  There's a variety of accents that the game tried to implement to give the spirits personality, and for the most part, it works.It takes guts to try to break out from an established franchise, especially one revered as a classic, and make a prequel with radically different gameplay mechanics.  Dawn of Mana tried to provide an action twist on the series.  Unfortunately, with shoddy character development, some weak combat and story mechanics and gameplay issues, this adventure is a passable successor in name only.  It's fun in spots, but not nearly as engaging as the original title.", "date": "May 22, 2007"}
