Afterall, the game and movie are two separate pieces of entertainment and should be evaluated independently. But, to hell with all of that. Seeing the movie does give you a certain take on the game and since we played it both before and after the glorious midnight premier (GMP), we're going to let out all of our feelings on the game.  Without ruining too much of the movie, we can tell you that the game is based on the epic pod race in the film when Anakin Skywalker shows off those great piloting skills we hear about in the later movies.  You have a dozen or so aliens zipping around a circuit in their custom hot rods that all have the same basic design of two giant floating thrusters towing a little open air carriage for the pilot. The design of the pods are amazing. The two giant thrusters are bound to each other by a band of pure energy that keeps them aimed in the same direction and in close proximity to each other so as to allow better control as you zoom along at over 500 miles per hour.  Gameplay  Episode I Racer is like most other conventional racers where the object of the game is to beat your opponents across the finish line in the standard race mode. In Racer, this is just too easy, even though it is one of the fastest racer we've ever played. The very first time we played, we won handily. We know we're strong with the Force, but nobody should be that good right off the bat. This is confirmed by the fact that we won the next half dozen or so races before we started looking for a way to make the game more challenging.  After seeing the movie, the adrenaline of recreating the thrill of the pod race made us even better and we scoffed at the other racers as we set new lap records every time around the track.  To be fair, the game has great control considering it really does feel like you're going close to the speed of sound. Those good old repulsor lifts keep your pod and thrusters hovering a constant  5-10 feet above the ground and the pod has surprisingly good traction for a vehicle that never touches the ground. The strange thing is, even on the ice level, your hovering craft will slip and slide around like a car if you're not careful. Of course, all the pods have different top speeds, handling and cornering abilities, but none of the ones we played got out too much out of control. And this is the problem with Racer. LucasArts made the game very user friendly with almost no learning curve so that the challenge is almost nonexistent until you get deep into the game. Staying interested throughout the early levels is the tough part.  There's a turbo function where you have to build up power in your engines before you can give yourself that extra boost. This is definitely a skill that requires some concentration, but the fact of the matter is, you won't need turbo to win any race early on. Wipeout 64 is a good point of reference, not only because of the floaty vehicle physics, but because both games have a whole lot of speed to offer. The difference is, Wipeout demanded mastery of several skills before a player could win a race. Racer is definitely easy to get into but the tutorial seems to last a little too long.  You will certainly need to be better by the time you reach the later levels in the game but the A.I. of the drones you're racing against seems to stay the same. After the first relatively tame Tatooine race, players move onto different worlds with more jumps, shortcuts, obstacles and sharp turns that are definitely a challenge. However, even if you do crash several times on a track and several drones do pass you, it doesn't take much to regain the lead, especially if you're on the last few laps when you'll know the track. Even thought the game does get tougher as you go along, the later levels aren't as challenging as they could be because you as a player have gotten better by that time as well.  No weapons or power-ups kept the game in line with what was seen in the movie and there's something to be said for the accurate translation. But, we kept thinking how cool it would have been to throw wrenches into your opponents' engines or really force them off the road. The bottom line is, if there's not going to be a challenge from the actual racing, then we should have some other goodies and gadgets for bashing competitors just to keep it interesting.  Graphics  The game looks a lot like the film. The sense of speed is remarkable without making everything blurry and streaky like you would expect it to be if you could really race pods. When you get a lot of other vehicles on the screen there's a distinct drop in frame rate, with or without the Expansion Pak. To get the best visual experience, flip on the hi-res mode and run the Time Trial. Very cool.  In the standard race mode the LucasArts' alleged hi-res mode looks more like medium resolution (there are jaggies everywhere) and is actually pretty good. When you make the switch to low resolution to increase frame rate, prepare to be grossed out by the giant flying pixels and vaseline-style blurriness.  The details of the pod racers are good enough so that you can see a flap open when you turn or see the flames coming from a thruster when you speed up.  In the case of Anakin Skywalker, the giant yellow control flaps on the front ends of his engines open and close to change wind resistance as you turn left and right. You can actually see the flaps on the side of his carriage pod flap open and closed as the pod tries to stay behind the sleek engines.  On Tatooine, you can clearly see all of the dirt, rock and dual suns the desert planet is known for, but like Luke said in Jedi, ~there's not much to see here.~ On some of the other worlds you can catch flying ships, trams and other assorted vehicles flying by as you race, but since you're going so fast, you can't really appreciate them. Remember all of the vehicles taking off and flying about in Shadows of the Empire? Racer tries to recapture that feeling, but in Shadows you were on foot and could turn and watch the Millennium Falcon an imperial shuttles flying away. Streaking by in a pod tends to keep you focused on what's in front of you since those walls and obstacles seem to pop up instantly.  Sadly, the excellent cut-scenes from the PC version didn't make the cut. Not even the trademark text roll is here. Instead, we're treated to short, jerky intros with little life to them -- a far cry from the impressive scenes in Rogue Squadron.  Sound  The sound of the game just isn't what it should be considering that Racer is a game that could really benefit from great audio elements. Before the movie came out we had no idea what a pod racer would sound like in real-life (?), so we took the low, humming noise from the engines at face value and assumed that's what they would sound like. After seeing The Phantom Menace, we now know we were cheated in the sound department.  In the movie, the rumbling power of Sebulba's pod sounded like a runaway locomotive and it made us think something was wrong with one of the engines. The whining of the other engines in the race immediately reminded us of what we didn't have in Episode I Racer. Granted, the movie sound is going to be better than the videogame because of the theatre and George Lucas' near-perfect THX sound technology. However we should at least get something close to what we heard in the movie. Factor 5 and LucasArts pulled off incredible surround sound effects and stereo music in Rogue Squadron -- but don't expect to hear anything remotely as good in Racer. The music, low-fidelity digitized mono streams, is like a throwback to Shadows, and there isn't nearly as much voice chatter to be heard in this game. Why LucasArts didn't go with the same sound technology with Racer is beyond us...  Still, Episode I racer has a few good character sounds and reactions that help the game along. You can hear Anakin yelling as he gets bumped around and get all excited when he breaks out with a turbo boost. Since Anakin is the only English speaking racer, you'll have to decipher the exclamations and comments from the various alien races in the game with you. Just like the movie characters, you don't have to speak the alien dialects to understand the anger in the voice of the one eyed, six armed insectoid hollering at you after you knock him into a wall. When you hang out in the junkyard long enough, maybe you'll get a kick out Watto's bizarre alien (we mean immigrant not extra-terrestrial) accent. After the movie we loved it even more. Episode I Racer is a decent racer that gets an added boost from having the power of the Star Wars universe behind it. We thought the movie would shed some light on some of the characters in the game so we could get to know them better. Alas, the only racer besides Anakin and Sebulba that we really got to know in the movie was the pie-face man who stalled at the starting line and lost his four engines in the crowd. The lack of an initial challenge makes it tough to stay with the game until it does get interesting. Maybe, like Anakin, we need a nemesis like Sebulba to get the most out of ourselves and the game.", "date": "May 20, 1999"}
