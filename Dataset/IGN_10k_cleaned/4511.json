{"name": "LifeLine", "name_review": "Lifeline", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/03/lifeline", "text": "Originally created by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. internally in Japan, Lifeline, the North American name for the Japanese game Operator's Side, is a unique, innovative and yet exasperating game that delivers equal amounts of pleasure and pain.     It's an adventure game designed to be controlled with a voice-recognition USB-compatible headset. Players use a hefty set of voice commands to direct a secondary character through a labyrinth-style space hotel, solving puzzles, fighting aliens, and following a standard survival-horror premise. The first third of the game presents the steepest part of the game's learning curve, as players figure out what they can and cannot do and say, how to expand their vocabulary to explore its intricacies (being good at crossword puzzles really helps), and how to fight the growing horde of powerful alien creatures.   Lifeline is in turns exciting, innovative and compelling, but it's equally cumbersome, frustrating, and repetitive. On the one hand, it genuinely relies on players to talk their way through the game, and a strong bond is bound to be created between the player and the lead character Rio. On the other, it's a slow-moving adventure game that's way behind its brethren in the sophistication department, the addiction department and on floor seven where the toys are, it's lacking in the fun department too.    Gameplay  The story starts off aptly enough. Along with your girlfriend Naomi, you're a guest at a Christmas day celebration on an orbiting space station hotel. Looking a little like the International Space Station on the outside and a gigantic, luxuriously designed hotel on the inside, the party progresses normally until a huge explosion shuts off all electricity. Minutes later, chaos runs amok. In the chilling dark, a zoo of small, medium and large aliens seemingly appear from nowhere and attack the guests, killing them off with ease and scaring the remaining passengers into hiding. The shock sends you into unconsciousness and when you wake up, Naomi is gone and you're locked inside a control room. By checking the monitors you befriend a waitress named Rio, who becomes your friend.    Since you're locked in and she's free. A partnership is struck. You help her get in and out of doors and she solves the mystery of the explosion. By means of numerous video cameras set across the entirety of the hotel, you're able to command her where to go and what to do. The only thing is, you don't play as her. You watch her through the video cameras and by utilizing the any USB headset, you tell her what to do. The game is 90% voice-controlled, which is where the game's schizophrenic qualities come in.    In most respects, Lifeline is a predictable, middle-of-the-road adventure game. Remove the USB headset and it loses much of its worth, becoming a dull, below average title. Add in the headset, however -- and we are reviewing this game with the headset -- it's quirky and likeable, annoying and lacking.  The controls work well enough. Players use voice commands for about 90% of the game. By pressing and holding Circle, players open up voice communications, and they can make Rio walk, run, fight, inspect items, and by using a neat Consultation mode in which you can ask questions about general aspects of the story, characters, etc, you can engage in a regular sort of conversation. You might even learn a thing or two.     The interface is interesting because you it requires you learn a basic vocabulary to function. At first it's hard to know what is what. The lexicon of words and small phrases is seemingly minimal at first, but Rio's ability to function is based on a 500-word set that's quite impressive. She recognizes colors, directions such as left and right, and when accurate descriptions fail you, vague words such as ~stuff~ and ~thing~ work quite well when in a pinch.    The command set works decently in combat. When in a fight (with a large assortment of generic alien slugs, toad-like things, humanoid creatures, spider-like aliens and more) she automatically pulls out a weapon and prepares to fight. You command her to shoot, and a menu screen appears that indicates the body part of the enemy you can yell to shoot at. The parts alternate from being vulnerable to entirely blocked, so you have to time shots to the head, tentacle, stomach, tail, eyeball, etc. Rio can dodge enemy attacks left, right and back, she can reload, and she can run -- all of which are helpful given the increasing level of enemies as the story progresses.      Having said that, the fights are silly and simplistic. After playing an adventure game such as Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time with its beautiful acrobatic flips and jumps, or the action-adventure game The Mark of Kri with its specialized group combo attacks, these fights are laughable. Even without comparing this adventure to those more action-oriented titles, you'll realize the fights boil down you yelling a set of commands, ~Shoot, shoot, shoot!~ ~left~ ~dodge~ and ~reload~ a whole lot. On the whole, these commands are the verbal translations of any other adventure game, only in those games you're pressing buttons that equal left, right, dodge, and reload. But here, because the voice-recognition system isn't all that fast (relative to what we're used to in adventure games) and because there is always the likelihood that Rio won't understand your words, you consistently have far less conrol. For instance, I've commanded her to move left in a fight and instead she backs up, or I've said reload and she says, ~Move to where?~ You'll quickly learn that the margin for error is quite substantial. And you'll probably quickly conclude that a voice-command system isn't the best way to fight in a game. It does indeed work; it functions. But there are enough little flaws and mechanical gaps in its design that it's by no means a good substitute the old Dpad.    The speech recognition system is still quite deep. But in order for it to work, you'll need a little preparation. This is not a party game. You'll need a quiet room to play this, and no distractions from anyone else since you need to hear everything Rio has to say. You'll need to practice enunciating regular words and learning the speed at which the game best responds. Say things too slow or too fast and Rio is checking the bathroom instead of the living area, walking out the door instead of checking the bathroom. Say something right and she should understand you, but sometimes she'll do the exact opposite, which is, needless to say, frustrating. Playing Lifeline is often equivalent to talking with a semi-deaf relative -- you repeat everything, loudly and often.   The learning curve includes identifying the actual name of objects, which can be both a challenge, like a word puzzle, or a bitch -- frustrating and less than likeable. And the core things you do in the game are pretty mundane. For instance, you inspect an inordinate amount of stuff. Each room has a set of tagged items in it, such as a dinner table, a bed, or an emergency panel, for example. At the dinner table, for instance, three items may be tagged for inspection, a bottle of wine, a roast chicken, and a note. The game requires you to guess the name of the object, which seems simple enough. You press Circle, and tell Rio to ~Check wine.~ Usually that works. But it might be a turkey instead of a chicken, a bottle of champagne instead of wine, or a catalogue instead of a book. You could say book, magazine, or pamphlet numerous times, but it won't work, because the game distinguishes between a book and a catalogue. The thing is, you might spend five minutes trying to get the right word to simply inspect a worthless book. There are numerous instances like this, where you see a flashy little item, such as a sticky note on the back of an invitation, but it might take you five minutes to find the correct words (it's not ~check back of note~, but instead ~check behind invitation.~) Each situation seems to require a new word or phrase.     Adding to the dilemma, many objects are too vaguely designed to determine what they are. A seemingly neaty zoom function looks like it solves that problem, but zoom cannot be controlled to target specific items. So, you might not know if the box on the table is a present, a box or a safe. If you choose to zoom in, like I did, the camera zooms in on the bed, which doesn't help at all.    After a few hours of experimentation, some of the repetitiveness is lessened. You'll become more efficient and get the formula down. Instead of simply moving Rio with the left analog or Dpad, you'll repeat these phrases a lot:  ~Check room~ ~inspect table~ and ~Go to Shutter X.~ The list of things you can do or say is curiously engaging and remains somewhat novel through out, but the process is equally tedious and repetitive, nullifying most elements of innovation or charm.      The game design follows a standard formula of collecting keys, fighting, exploring and putting story elements together. If you have played Resident Evil or Silent Hill, you'll instantly become familiar with this design. The little story tidbits, however, become interesting because players will soon learn what these ~aliens~ actually are and where they came from. Needless to say, the hotel's collapse wasn't random in any way, making it SPOILER: a little like Half-Life that way.   There are a handful of unusual situations, however, that endear Lifeline to players. Rio talks to you directly, and she often requires you to think outside the norms the game initially sets up. For instance, in one room, she enters a room, and the scenario looks like a cutscene. You see an alien slug sneak up behind her, and the orange bar that usually says ~Cannot Talk~ in the upper corner quietly disappears. If you miss it, after the fight, she'll look directly at the monitor -- at you -- and scold you for not helping. In other situations, such as when she's in the bathroom, one cannot help oneself from being a dirty perv.  I said something like, ~Take off your clothes and get in the shower. She was familiar with that response. She quipped, ~Not in your lifetime.~ It's strangely endearing. I learned I can handle rejection from a smiling, sexy polygonal girl any old day, especially when she's funny about it.    Another scenario that's equally inventive is slightly more annoying. You have to collect two pieces of paper, each with a saying on it to enter into the ~Sun Suite.~ You then have to say the two phrases individually, and then in harmony. I messed up a few times, and Rio grew increasingly irritated at me, responding with new, annoyed responses each time. These instances are few and far between, but they're compelling enough to stick with the game, and given the relatively dull story and level design, something's got to get you going, right?   Graphics  Lifeline is a decent looking game; and if it suffers from anything, it's that it looks average in just about every aspect. The character designs are rather primitive, with lots of pointy elbows and unhealthily skinny people with weird, matted hair. The hotel backgrounds are plain, generic and sterile in most cases. The hotel is pretty much a basic hotel: The texture work and the design just do their job in a very workmanlike manner. The alien design is also dull too. There is nothing here that will shock or surprise you; at least nothing did me. Rio is pretty, but she walks and runs funny, and she looks more like an animated stick figure than a believable human character. I wish I had more to say about the visuals, but there really isn't much to elaborate upon. If anything, this looks like a really good port from an arcade game, along the lines of Time Crisis or Virtua Cop, and less like say, Konami's pretty Shadow of Destiny.    Sound  Technically, Lifeline offers little. It doesn't support Dolby Digital or Dolby Pro Logic II, and it's not supported with widescreen or progressive scan (though those last two don't have much to do with sound).    Musically, the decent score captures a sense of excitement and drama, though nothing about it is terribly memorable. Rio's character is well voice acted, however, by the star of the TV show, She Spies, Kristen Miller. Miller shows many vocal inflections and there seems to be a lot of character details and backstory written into her part, so she becomes more and more interesting as the game progresses. Overall, the dialog runs the gamut from good and interesting to dull and dislikeable. It's an OK script.If you're looking for something new and you're willing to experiment a bit with an adventure game -- and you're instilled with a healthy amount of patience -- then I recommend renting, if not buying, Lifeline. Overall, the voice-recognition system is deep and mostly engaging, even if it's a mixed bag with regard to its implementation. Some things work, others don't, but the game's recognition system is inconsistent. Because of this, there is a mildly steep learning curve that's sometimes exciting and other times frustrating. The voice-recognition part of the game is really its big draw. So, if you like talking to your games, well, OK, yelling at your games, then give it a shot. But if you've had it with dull adventure games, and you hate wearing a headset, steer far clear of this.", "date": "Mar 3, 2004"}
