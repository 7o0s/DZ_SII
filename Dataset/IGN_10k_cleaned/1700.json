That's why we stopped by our old bud Tom Chick's house, woke him from his drunken slumber, wiped the crust out of his eyes, and asked him if he'd like to evaluate some of the PC gaming classics as compared with their contemporaries. He wittily replied, ~Uh, sure,~ and thus PC Retroview was born.   SSI's first Panzer General was an experiment based on a Japanese console game.  It was wildly successful.  You could say it was the equivalent of the French Revolution in wargaming -- suddenly, the entrenched monarchy of stuffy elitist tradition was overthrown and the genre was opened to the masses.  Panzer General captured some important military concepts without the need for complicated tables and a fat rules book.  Terrain, supply, experience and combined arms were all significant factors without bogging down the game's mechanics.  The first game was a huge success and it spawned what SSI dubbed the 5-Star General series.  As the series soldiered on, it got worn out and a bit tired.  The graphics got more advanced and the series was eventually slathered in photorealistic artwork, draped onto 3D engines of questionable value, and renamed ~The Living Battlefield Series.~  The mechanics got more complex, but it's arguable whether this made the games any better.  Unlike wargames, which you play to win once you've learned the mechanics, these games were designed to be played like a puzzle game: you have to play -- and fail -- once to figure out the solution and then you play a second time to implement the solution.  The series went to various fronts and even left the real world entirely with science fiction and fantasy installments.  Since a lot of the game's initial appeal was its historical trappings, there is no small amount of irony that the best instance of the Panzer General games was Fantasy General.  Fantasy General was the last installment before the photorealistic artwork kicked in and cluttered up the maps.  It was created by the same internal development team, headed up by Paul Murray, that has made all the games (with the exception of Star General, which was farmed out to a developer called Catware).  Once you look past the fact that the unit pictures are trolls and dragons instead of infantrymen and tanks, Fantasy General looks very much like the previous Generals.  Each unit's information panel is illustrated with a dramatic line drawing that adds more character than the historical games' rather dry detail screens.  As for the actual mechanics, the Panzer General provides a good framework for the fantasy milieu.  Although you can see the engine's roots in the ten basic unit classes (Sky Hunters are fighters, Bombardiers are bombers, Siege Engines are artillery, Cavalry are armor), the system doesn't just feel like the same old game with an alternative tile set.  The unit types are further divided into four races, each with their own mechanics.  Many units' special abilities make them unique and useful in a way that a historical game wouldn't allow.  Instead of Panzer General's concept of suppression, Fantasy General uses wounds that can be healed by resting.  Spells have a significant impact, as do the special abilities of whatever wizard you're playing.  Thankfully, Fantasy General dispenses with Panzer General's supply rules, which often slowed the gameplay.  How many times have I tried to fire artillery only to realize my 105mm battery was out of ammo?  Ugh...I'm glad dragons and giants don't use bullets.  The concept of combined arms is deeply ingrained in Fantasy General, which lays out an almost ironclad rock/paper/scissors system by giving each unit either a missile, melee, or skirmish attack.  This is further complicated by different types of damage and weaknesses (for instance, mechanical units are more easily damaged by magic).  The balance and counterbalance among these attack and damage types makes the game about much more than mere unit strength.  It's not very intuitive, but it's at the heart of the system and it forces the player to make some difficult choices about the kinds of units he wants to play with.    Another difficult choice is how the player spends his gold, which is the equivalent of Panzer General's prestige.  Gold is split between buying available units and researching new ones.  The campaign structure, always a strong point in the series, gives you a reason to care about your units as they gather experience, get upgraded, and find magic items (which anticipates the abilities you can buy for your units in People's General).  The choice of wizards to lead your forces adds a lot to Fantasy General's already considerable replay value.  Also, it's always nice to be able to name your own units, which can be much more fun in Fantasy General than it was in the historical games: the ~Knights of Nee~ and ~Gollum's Heroes~ does a lot more to tickle the imagination than a division and battalion number.    Fantasy General could have been one of the few great PBEM games, but SSI inexplicably hobbled it by leaving out a replay feature to see what your opponent did during his turn (for some reason, this crucial PBEM features was included in Allied General and then abandoned in the rest of the games).  In the campaign, it's possible to paint yourself into some frustrating corners in the later game and the puzzle nature of the missions shows through at times.  But the random map generator and the single player campaign gives Fantasy General more replayability than any of the other titles in the series  it's one of those games you can visit once a year and still enjoy.  Although it refused to yield up any screenshots no matter what I tried, it runs just fine in Windows, snuggled comfortably in its own DOS session.  Your choice for the best of the 5-Star General/Living Battlefield Series will, of course, depend on a number of factors.  But one of the reasons I think Fantasy General works so well is that it feels a little strange recreating historical battles with this system.  It's one thing to capture the sweep of the entire World War in an abstract game like Axis & Allies, but it's quite another to render down Kursk, Omaha Beach or Tobruk to little pictures and mechanics barely more complex than Stratego.  I'm glad for what the Panzer General system did to streamline wargaming, but the hard-core wargamer in me is a little uncomfortable with it: the more specific your history, the more conspicuous your abstractions.  Non-wargamers probably wonder what the hell I'm talking about, but it's one reason I particularly enjoyed Fantasy General's flights of fancy.  Star General would have been another contender, but it didn't quite capture the scale you need for a space opera.  -- Tom Chick Want to share your opinions with the world?Talk about it on the IGNPC message boards,  orsend some mail to IGNPC about this story.  Presentation  A superlative campaign system in an engaging fantasy motif.   9.0  Graphics  The dinky artwork and washed out maps are serviceable.   4.0  Sound  A suitably rousing soundtrack and not much else.   6.0  Gameplay  The paper/rock/scissors mechanics of the Panzer General games at their best.   8.0  Lasting Appeal  Very high replay value that could have been even better with good PBEM support.   8.0  Should I Go Back and Play It?  An overlooked game almost as good as the Warlords and Heroes of Might & Magic series.   Yes  OVERALL SCORE    (not an average)   8.0 When we think of turn-based fantasy gaming, there's a line of sleepers that goes back to QQP's Conquered Kingdoms.  Although Fantasy General is often overlooked, it deserves a place at the right hand of lineups like SSG's Warlords and 3DO's Heroes of Might & Magic.  It's not as elegant as the former or accessible as the latter, but it's a clear example of Panzer General's flexible mechanics at their best.", "date": "Jan 4, 2001"}
