Airing Sunday nights at 9 PM ET on ABC, the show employs far-fetched storylines in very soap operatic fashion and manages to net an average 20 million viewers a week, making it one of the most popular television shows on right now.  Publisher Buena Vista Games and Developer Liquid Entertainment decided to try to leverage the popularity of this show and its non-gamer demographic by creating a simulation title set on Wisteria Lane.  They managed to put together a solid sim while staying true to the show's audience and providing players their own home in the troubled suburb with their own overdramatic story to uncover.The graphic designers did a beautiful job of recreating the characters of Desperate Housewives.  Teri Hatcher's character, Susan, actually looks like her and this is true of every recognizable character in the game.  Players will create a persona and, while it has some options, at the end of the day, more would be nice.  Character creation involves choosing from pre-designed faces, hairstyles and clothing.  Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there as far as customization options go.  The husband and son characters have even fewer choices, where the entire look is pre-designed rather than being able to piece parts together.  The home the player will live in cannot be redesigned to any significance.  The only options involve upgrading different pieces of furniture and appliances to give them a new look (and associated benefits) or changing the colors of the floors and walls in the different rooms, but nothing can be moved and there are no options for choosing different house layouts.  All the options cost money, of course, so money is something of minor value in this game.  Everyone who loves The Sims franchise for its interior decorating options, and that alone, will find that lacking here. The graphics look fantastic and very close to the characters from the show. One of the truly bright spots to be found is with the sound.  The music is appropriate and very well done, sometimes even catchy.  The voice acting is good for the most part.  Brenda Strong reprises her role as the narrator, Mary Alice Young, and it helps for believability for fans of the show.  The other characters have good mimics, but none of the other actors from the show carried their voice into this game.  There are moments where other character's voices do not shine so brightly, but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment.The story is somewhat  clich, but we are talking about a title based on a night-time soap opera here.  The player's character, husband and son have just moved onto Wisteria Lane, where she will get the opportunity to finally, after twenty years, discover the truth of her identity.  You see, she's an amnesiac who believed everything her husband told her about her previous life without question after she lost her memory two decades earlier.  Along the way, she'll help the other residents of her suburban neighborhood with tasks ranging from mundane to serious.  The choices the player makes with which sub-plots to follow and which paths to take in the main plot will seriously affect the next moves the player can make, which means the game has some replayability built into it.The interface is pretty simple and boxes pop-up when a mouse moves over them indicating what each one does, so the game is not hampered by a poorly designed or hard to understand interface.  However, the controls are not as well done.  There's no run option.  Movement can be sped up by doubling game speed, one of the three options for game time passage.  Double clicking on a location on the map will also take the player directly there, provided they are outside.  There is a loading time associated with this, though, so it's just about as quick as doubling game speed and walking over.  The angles can get awkward at times as well.  This makes it difficult to look around the room or move to a specified location.  Keyboard movement might have alleviated this issue, since all movement is mouse driven.  The only place this becomes aggravating is at the mall, where moving to and from the car involves baby steps with the mouse.  A little more time tweaking the movement situation may have benefited this title greatly.    Gardening, cooking and online poker make up the mini-games the player can participate in.  Cooking and gardening can also be hired out.  As cooking skills are perfected or the garden is tended well, new flowers and recipes are opened up.  Sub-plots will come in that might make use of the mini-games as well.  A well-tended garden just might help the player land a spot in a fashion show, for example.Socializing with neighbors opens up a whole new degree to the game.  Every character has secrets and if the player schmoozes up to them enough, they'll spill their secrets.  Having strong relationships is beneficial at different times in the game, since some sub-plots are dependant upon that.  It is relatively easy to build strong relationships by chatting with characters.  There are usually options in the dialogue tree as to what stance to take, from super friendly to somewhat bitchy.  Sometimes, using the wrong option will close the dialogue altogether, but it doesn't ever really damage a relationship irreparably or close a sub-plot (unless this is a choice point for the plot). Cooking is one of the mini-games available to play. There are four needs to address and they are fairly easy to maintain.  A quick shower and change of clothes and the appearance need is taken care of.  Socializing with the family and neighbors will increase social need - and since this is a fairly important part of the game, should be easy to deal with.  Composure and happiness seem to take care of themselves, with little effort, just in the natural course of the day's activities.  The day ends at 10 PM.  You can stay awake or you can sneak around others houses and do stuff around the house, but if you choose to go to sleep, it doesn't affect the game one way or another.  Most of the game will be spent socializing with neighbors and working on the goals of the game rather than doing mundane and boring activities, which is always nice.Desperate Housewives is one of the first games to really employ in-game advertising to a large degree.  Many items in the house have a sponsor.  For example, clicking on the shower shows it is brought to us by Suave.  The vanity on the other hand is sponsored by Caress.  Certain events in the game will also open up coupons the player can print out and use in real life.  A casually placed package of Slim Fast is on the counter in the kitchen.  It can get away with all of this over-advertising, though, thanks to the nature of the game.  It is set in a modern day suburb and women do drink Slim Fast, use Suave and like coupons.Speaking of its target audience, the developers did a great job actually making a game that women might enjoy.  Since most of the people who watch Desperate Housewives are women, it follows that the audience for a game based on the show is women.  It is easy to jump into, has some interesting plot points that will draw fans of the show in, and has high production values in several key spots that ensures they won't be turned off, like by poor voice actors or graphics glitches.  The only area that might frustrate a novice gamer, which this title is likely to appeal to, is the movement issues and that definitely detracts from the enjoyment for a casual gamer.  However, if players are able to overlook that and enjoy sensationalized stories, then Desperate Housewives: The Game might just be a good purchase (and maybe even a gateway game to bigger and better for the non-gamer!)", "date": "Nov 8, 2006"}
