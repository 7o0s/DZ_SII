RACE features a great set of cars, a slew of player-friendly modes and comes from the makers of the finest driving sims ever. But, for all its positive features, it's not that good a game. Actually, that statement requires qualification, because if you ignore its heritage - SimBin has already brought us GTR, its genre-defining sequel and the underappreciated GT Legends - there's actually a lot to recommend. The problem is, if you're at all familiar with any of these games, you're going to feel disappointed. In fact, in almost every tactile and visual way, RACE is not even as good as its predecessors. And that's just bizarre.    However, if you're coming to it fresh, perhaps via something like the TOCA, Live For Speed or rFactor, you're not going to notice. The cars will simply look a little basic, both inside and out, and you won't wonder where SimBin's previously exceptional dedication to detail and realism has gone. The synthesised, inauthentic engine sounds won't stand out because they're of the same (reasonable) standard as most racers out there and you'll never realise what you're missing - and that's the microphone-melting dedication to genuine mechanical cacophony of GTR and GTL. You'll revel in the velvety tire model and enjoy balancing these cars on the edge of adhesion, without it ever feeling like the driving aids are still on even when they're not.    Okay, okay. We'll stop weeping over what this isn't - despite there being no good reason for a lack of progress, let alone the backward step - and we'll admit that our last gripe, about the driving model being a little dumbed down, actually works in its favour. These cars are undoubtedly easier to control and consequently RACE is more accessible than its somewhat hardcore stablemates - think of it parked squarely between GTR (at the trickier end of the scale) and GTR in the middle, while Need For Speed flops around at the easy end of the spectrum.    Yet despite all this, the overriding factor in how much you'll enjoy RACE is how you feel about front-wheel drive cars. The World Touring Car Championship is dominated by them, with only BMW fielding a rear-drive machine, and it's hardly worth buying for that. There's a better version in GTR2. That said, it's undeniably fun to drive Andy Priaulx's championship-winning 320i as, despite the name, Priaulx is in fact British; he's the only driver in the series from Gurnsey and the only one we've personally witnessed coming out of a ladies' toilet in Baharin. Twice. True story.     For our money, front-drive is certainly interesting, a new technique and a fun break from the norm, but exciting? That's a stretch. FWD is best encapsulated by F1 commentator Martin Brundle's phrase 'hurry up and wait' you spend most of the corner waiting, waiting, waiting to really get on the gas. Still, here it's pleasingly delicate and the key is to get just enough power on to pull the nose into the turn - too much or too little slides you wide - before squeezing it on as the corner opens up. Fortunately you have some fairly strong lift-off oversteer to help you into the corner and the rear gets looser the faster you go, making high speed corners a satisfying battle against speed-sapping tyre scrub. It's pleasurable to master and an engaging drive, but exercising restraint and/or ploughing straight on is just not sexy. Drifting sideways under power is. Still, those are the cars of the WTCC. Oh, and the Alfa Romeo is particularly sweetly balanced.    SimBin also had to work with the tracks the series uses and not all of them are classics. Fortunately the lumpy, bumpy, high-speed Brands Hatch stands out despite being terribly inaccurate (hardcore track-love has gone the same way as the other detail), and Turkey has the rare distinction of being new, F1-friendly and fun.     The real highlight, however, is Macau. It's a very fast, long, narrow, hilly, barrier-lined, blind-cornered street circuit that makes Monaco look like a row of balloon animals. The AI's not at its best here - we've seen a mass-pileup in pit lane and one wreck broadside across the track for an entire qualifying session - but even real drivers screw up in Macau. Chances are you won't have driven it elsewhere, either, unlike Monza, Magny Cours, Valencia and the like. And when the AI cars stay out of the barriers they're quick - six or seven seconds quicker on Pro difficulty over Semi-Pro, for instance, which should challenge anyone. Remember this: if you love racing cars, the pleasure of learning and driving this incredible track is very nearly worth the purchase alone. It's one of the few places where RACE stops being reasonable and starts being exciting.     The presentation is exciting too, particularly the inspired use of tense, almost Bond-ish music, and the WTCC's two-race format works well. The two scores give an aggregate winner, making it worth persevering through a bad race and the first eight finishers are reversed for race two. This means extra work if you were on the podium or a helping hand if you were down near eighth. Fastest lap 'duels' with set drivers add a little spice, as does decent wet weather effects. However, the deeply crass dust-and-squashed-flies effect is so overcooked you end up with the wipers on even when it's dry.   And so inevitably, we fall back to 'reasonable'. Or less. The option to run 1987-spec cars is thin (only two models) while the Minis are shrill, slow and loveless. If you'd modelled them yourself you'd be proud, but they're more A-Level than Triple-A, hobbling the car porn potential of the Eurosport-branded replays. Shame.If youre finding TOCA Race Driver 3 a little too easy, RACE might do the trick. You can learn on the duller tracks and then tackle Macau for a wonderful challenge. But if youre at all familiar with the characters of the driving sim elite, RACE will feel like a decent photofit that somehow, somewhere, got a little bit wet and smeared.", "date": "Nov 23, 2006"}
