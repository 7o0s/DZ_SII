{"name": "Swing Away Golf", "name_review": "Swing Away Golf", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/10/23/swing-away-golf", "text": "There are generally two different types of golf games -- golf simulations and arcade-style golf. T&E Soft's Swing Away Golf, which is being published by Electronic Arts for release in the States, falls under the category arcade-style golf, which means that it's going to make people want to know one thing, ~so, how does it compare to Hot Shots Golf?~   Gameplay  Well, how does Swing Away compare to Hot Shots? In terms of gameplay modes and play options, it compares favorably. There are numerous gameplay modes available to the player including a brilliantly made story mode and other single player and multiplayer settings that are pretty much on par with what you'd expect from a golf game on a console.   The story mode, however, is much more robust than what we've seen in any typical console-based golf videogame. First of all, the game lets you pick from one of seven different character models to begin your career with. And instead of giving you a preset skill level for each of these characters, it allows you to determine their skill by distributing Skill Points for Distance, Accuracy, Control and Recovery.   The fun doesn't stop there, either, as after creating your character you can take him or her through a career that begins at the amateur ranks. And in the story mode, players will be challenged by other opponents, given the opportunity to choose from among sever different caddies that will interact with the player during the golf tournaments. The truth of the matter is that there are just way too many features and options to explain in a review without just reciting the game's manual. Just trust us when we say that this game has more features than any other golf videogame that you'll see on a console.   The most important thing to know is that the game is more than just a lot of features thrown together, as it's a very enjoyable game to play, as well. It uses the standard three-click C-meter for regular swings and a two-click method for putting. It's very simple to get into and even simpler to master. Therein lies the problem as the game ends up being just a bit too easy, supplying the player with very little challenge. While it's a lot of fun, the pace of the game moves along quite nicely (the button to speed up the game is a fantastic option and should be in all golf games), and there's so many bells and whistles to keep players playing for years, its lack of challenge takes away a lot of the game's appeal and keeps it from being a Hot Shots Golf killer. It's a fantastic game, but just doesn't have the magic of Hot Shots.   Graphics  The game is beautiful. Everything from the wonderfully designed characters to the bright and very colorful 3D backgrounds just adds up to what's a very appealing game to the eyes. The backgrounds are brought to life with some amazing looking trees, great-looking water, and some very distinctive background effects including moving clouds and some cool environmental effects. This is one of the best-looking golf games, if not the very best, that has ever been released on a console.    Sound  If you're a fan of very light happy-go-lucky music that's normally hear in elevators, then you'll probably want the music from Swing Away Golf put onto a soundtrack. The music in the game is very light-hearted and will either make your frown turn upside down or drive you silly. And if the music doesn't give you enough happiness, it's backed up by some quirky sound effects and an array of chirpy voiceovers that are sometimes a blast to listen to.  It might not be as great as Hot Shots Golf, but it's a phenomenal golf game nonetheless. Swing Away Golf is a fun to play arcade game that has more options and play modes than anyone could wish for in a golf videogame. The only real problem with it is that it's not really too challenging and that takes away a lot of the game's fun. Still, if you're looking for golf on your PlayStation 2, then you should pick this game up. It's a very solid effort from T&E Soft that can't be overlooked.", "date": "Oct 23, 2000"}
