Continuing on with the predestination paradox used in every time travel movie or game plot, you play as a Terminator sent back in time to prevent scientists from experimenting on the leftover robot parts found crushed in the machine press at the end of the first Terminator movie. With this knowledge, the human resistance has been slowly gaining an upper hand on Skynet in the future. Your job is to destroy the parts and kill the scientists. You do this by walking slow and killing guys in blue outfits and big rolling robots.   Controls are simple. The directional pad moves your Terminator. The center button fires your weapon while asterisk switches between your shotgun and whatever other weapons you happen to pick up. You can grab machine guns, assault rifles, Gatling guns and laser guns. The laser guns don't show up until later in the game are actually the weakest of the weapons so I wouldn't bother with those. The pound key throws grenades and is a weapon I never ever had to use though I did throw one just to hear the sound effect. It went boom.   Each stage has you accomplishing the exact same thing. Finding key cards and hacking interface cards to use on computer terminals. Sometimes just pressing the center button will unlock things for you, other times you'll have to remember a sequence of numbers and enter that code before time runs out to advance. If a flashing red beacon appears near a wall you can punch through it. Pressing jump then the down key will allow you to punch through the floor if there are no other visible exits. Please don't ask why the Terminator can't just punch through the stupid doors if he's able to punch through walls. Maybe we're playing as Terminator X from Public Enemy.   Killing enemies is pretty straightforward. Just stand there and unload on them. The human enemies are really stupid and if there are more than two onscreen you can hold the down button (which blocks for you) and watch them shoot each other, saving you ammo. Giant robots on tank tracks that were shown in Terminator 3 are your biggest threat but they're easily dispatched (or terminated -- haha) by holding down to block, then shooting them in between their firing pattern. These guys have the Gatling gun and killing them is the only way to replenish your Gatling ammo. There are plenty of other ammo boxes lying around for the other guns as well as health icons and armor vests. Should you die, you have a few seconds to copy the sequence of numbers shown onscreen to re-route power to your Terminator and begin the fight right where you left off. The more you die, the harder it is to copy the numbers flashing onscreen. Even if you revive yourself, your health is a lot lower, so you could end up dying again in seconds if you're surrounded.   The game takes place in both the future and the past. But each level looks exactly the same. They all take place inside a compound and you ride lifts and jump on retracting platforms to advance. The game is extremely repetitive and not without its fair share of problems. In the second to last level of the game, your mission is to find a commander and get his key card. I had to restart this level twice. The first time was because a lift decided to just disappear so there was no way for me to ever get to the computer console on top to unlock the door I needed to get through. The second restart was because of a timing issue. Riding a lift, I had to jump on a retracting panel, then jump again on another so I could jump up to a console. Problem is, the timing never changed during that part so I would always miss the second platform because it would retract. I restarted the level again and after standing there for ten minutes while swearing incessantly, the timing finally changed to where I could have that split second to make it and reach the console.    There are no boss battles. You're either shooting the humans who look and dress the same whether it's the future or past, or the robots. You can pretend a wall is a boss battle and just shoot it if you wish. It's almost as fun. The graphics aren't bad for a phone game but the lack of variety in anything didn't impress me. The song played was a slight variation on the Terminator theme and sounds effects were so-so with just about every gun sounding the same when you shoot it. There is no opening or ending scene once you beat the game. Just text. Maybe the entire production budget went to level design...  This is a very, very average action platform game. You'd have to be a real hardcore Terminator fan to want to play it and really hard-up for entertainment to actually enjoy it. If they had a bigger variety of enemies and levels it could have been a passable experience. Maybe in the future I can send myself back in time to prevent me from playing this game. Or pick the winning lottery numbers. One of the two.", "date": "Dec 4, 2007"}
