There's no doubt SEGA has achieved this with their strangely addictive SEGA Bass Fishing and SEGA Marine Fishing.  Natsume has also tried their hand in the fishing market with moderate success; unlike the arcade-like fishing games of SEGA, Natsume goes for the simulation angle, concentrating on the technical details of seasonal changes, water depth, and other minute fishing details to generate a very realistic fishing game.  That said, Natsume's fishing games were also pretty challenging because of the realism and perhaps that's why they made their most recent fishing game, Reel Fishing Wild a bit easier.  Unfortunately, it's now too easy to get fish and combined with the rather basic mechanics, average visuals, and lack of excitement, this was also one of the few games ever that actually put me to sleep.  From a technical standpoint, Reel Fishing Wild isn't a assy fishing game.  Take rod, bait, and skill to rivers, lakes and other bodies of water and fish!  You start off with two basic types of baits, but as you catch more fish, you'll unlock new baits, rods, and lines that will help you catch some of the bigger and badder fishes.  But in order to progress to the next stage, you have to fulfill each of the fishing requirements for each level  catching a number of specific fish found in each area.  The fishing mechanic is very simple and you don't have to worry too much about the outside elements, time, or methods on reeling in certain fish.  Simply cast the bait and reel it slowly in and when a fish is nearby your bait, the screen switches to an underwater view.  When the fish bites the bait, reel it in and rather than relying on the meter to tell when the line tension is going to break, in this game you listen to the splashing of the water  the more splashing noise coming from the fish, the more likelier the line is going to break.  Sounds like a pretty decent fishing game, eh?  Well, that's all you're going to get from Reel Fishing Wild.  Although the simple mechanics make it easy to pick up, there's also nothing new to learn  all that's left to learn is what bait to use and to make sure not to break the line.  Considering that it's almost too easy to catch fish, that shouldn't be a problem.  Yup, during the whole time I played the game, I broke my line once.  There's really no challenge when the fish are so easy to catch.  The controls are okay though I'm not too keen on the robotic-like casting animation.  The visuals are average; using a mix of digitized backgrounds with 3D polygons, the game looks alright though the frames of animation whenever there's some moving object in the digitized backgrounds (i.e. swaying trees, running water, etc.).  There are some nice lighting effects in the underwater mode, but that just show off the pixilated stones on the waterbed clearly.  The animation of the fishes are decent and the water effect, while nothing like we've seen in the Game Cube Wave Race, are okay.  The main glaring visual flaw is the combination of digitized visuals with 3D polygons that just doesn't work that well.  While it's hard to get some exciting visuals going on in a fishing game, I'm sure there's some way to make the fishing world a little more colorful. But none of this  the average gameplay and visuals  didn't put me to sleep... it's the drowsy music that plays when you're casting your bait that's like a virtual sleeping pill.  It doesn't help that once you go into the underwater view to watch yourself reel in the fish, there's no music at all.  Yes, the underwater sound effects are pretty nice and are pretty important if you want to avoid breaking your line, but it adds an additional amount of dreariness to the title.  Reel Fishing Wild is a pretty decent fishing game that, unlike SEGA's fishing game, doesn't capture the exciting elements of fishing, but the whole fishing experience overall.  That's a nice goal, but the game doesn't accomplish this with average visuals, plain play mechanics, and music that will send you to bed.  --Anthony Chau, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 1, 2001"}
