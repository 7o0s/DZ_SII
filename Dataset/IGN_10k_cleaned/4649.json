Now Gameloft, the mobile maker that Ubi just invested a ton of euros into, has brought Sam Fisher's secret exploits to the go-go crowd that either doesn't have access to an Xbox -- or just needs a little Fisher wherever they go. But when this cellphone port stands next to the console/PC version, does it hang its head in shame? Or does it walk tall?   Answer: Very tall.   Features:   Sequel to Splinter Cell  Side-scrolling stealth-action  Eight levels   Mobile games have been circling around Game Boy Advance quality like velociraptors, but Gameloft's Pandora Tomorrow is the first one makes the real kill. In fact, this side-scroller actually betters the GBA game currently on shelves -- not only is it a more realized stealth experience, but it costs a lot less, too.   Hopefully you're acquainted with Sam Fisher by now. He's the ~splinter cell,~ a lone ranger operative that uses shadows as a weapon. He's been called to duty, this time to help quell some terrorist action in a New World Order hot spot, East Timor. A terrorist by the name of Suhadi Sadono has crafted a biological nightmare scenario that only Sam can stop. Well, Sam and you.   Now there are several pretty good side-scrolling actioners on handsets right now, but Pandora Tomorrow advances the ball significantly by expertly fusing the stealth tactics of the console editions with some great level design and solid control. Sam lives or dies by the dark, and you will come to look at your ~shadow meter~ (which tells you how invisible you are to enemy guards) before checking your health bar. If Sam slips into the shadows at the right time, he can linger there until a guard moves close enough to crack over the skull with his pistol, or move far enough way to plug with two the back of the head.   You must also keep an eye on an ~alarm meter~ along the top of the screen that alerts you of how aware the guards are to your presence. Think of it like the radar in Metal Gear Solid. If a guard detects you, make haste to the shadows until the meter empties out and you are free to resume stalking.    Pandora Tomorrow's action spills across eight levels, from the opening act in the rural jungle of East Timor to a stealthy romp through a fortress, to a submarine mission to Sadono's secret cryogen lab. Each level is full of occupational hazards, such as guards and mines. Much like Prince of Persia you must think of these levels as equal parts puzzle and obstacle course.   Sam Fisher has a few slick moves and weapons at his command, such as a laser-sight pistol that is used for neutralizing guards and spotlights. Should you need to dispose of a guard's body, lest you raise the alarm, Sam can pick up the fallen stooge and toss him over ledges -- and sometimes right on to a mine. You can also use guards' eyes in retinal scan consoles, as well as drag them around like human shields.   Pandora Tomorrow looks spectacular on our tester Nokia 3650. The level of detail in the environments is amazing, and the animations assigned to each on-screen character are fantastic -- especially the crimson arc that erupts from the neck of a freshly-ganked guard. Nice touch. The game sounds good, too, with well-composed level music and excellent sound effects.How good is Pandora Tomorrow? Put it this way: I neglected the Xbox version of the game and a multiplayer appointment last night so I could play Gameloft's superlative mobile version. As the review says, this is seriously in GBA territory and marks an incredible new benchmark for future games to live up to, especially games from Gameloft. If you are in the market for a cellphone, make sure you buy one that can play this game.", "date": "Apr 16, 2004"}
