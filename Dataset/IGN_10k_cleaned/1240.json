Most of the time I'm inclined to be a little more politic about this sort of thing, having been trained in the art of game reviewing by bedrock wusses, but to borrow a line from the immortal Bill Hicks, ~I've played Tony Hawk 2!  Shut up!~  That is the name that will forever haunt every bike, board, or blade game coming down the pike in the next few generations of videogames.  Whatever they can do, Neversoft will have probably done it better.  In this case, Neversoft has done it a lot better - if you pass on MTV Sports Skateboarding and wait the week or so necessary until the release of Hawk 2, you will have saved yourself forty dollars and untold regret at purchasing a vastly inferior skateboarding game.  Gameplay  The first thing you'll come to grips with when you pick up MTV Skateboarding is the unresponsiveness of the control.  When you want something to happen in MTV, you have about a sixty-forty chance at it, and when you crash, more often then not you'll scratch your head and wonder.  The trick detection employs some arcane system of determining whether a trick will execute or not that remains thoroughly impenetrable.  Either it happens, or it doesn't happen, and the luck of the draw determines which.  This even extends to basic ollies - careful preparation and precise execution is required to just ollie up onto a knee-high slope or rail.  If you want to grind a lip atop a halfpipe, you have about an even chance of hitting the lip or bailing, and again, it's never evident why you crashed one time and hit the trick another.  And then occasionally you do a handplant, for equally obscure reasons.  Landing vert tricks is difficult, since the game is so persnickety about your facing once you land.  Stringing together combos is needlessly complex, thanks to the stiff control and erratic trick detection.  That leaves the level design, which isn't particularly conducive to easy combinations, standing way back at the end of the line of barriers to fun gameplay.  What does MTV do right in this area?  The addition of flatland tricks is nice, something that no other skateboarding game has done to any significant degree (save Hawk 2's manuals), and the structure of the Lifestyle mode is interesting - you work your way up through a series of challenges from skate spot local to pro superstar.  That good idea is also flawed, though, thanks to imprecise scoring and linear progression.  Each stage of the lifestyle mode requires that you accomplish certain tasks and achieve a certain score, but the score isn't the score you rack up doing tricks, it's one given you by a set of judges at the end of the level.  If you didn't score high enough, how high did you need to score?  The game doesn't seem to tell you.  It would be great fun to work your way through a wide variety of challenges, unlocking the game's myriad variety of decks, clothes, and other licensed odds and ends, but the link preceding that one in the replay value chain, a game that's fun to begin with, is broken.  Graphics  The levels are large (and there's a hell of a lot of them), but the textures are blurry, and the architecture is uninspired - the occasional animating texture is a nice change, but they're just window-dressing on a thoroughly unimpressive package.  The character models are small and indistinguished, the character animation is very unrefined.  When you can get them to happen, flips and grab tricks animate mechanically - there's often very little animation from the character model to accompany the movement of the board.  The bail animations, finally, are terrible.  Often, the graphics simply blip between your character standing on his board to lying flat on his face, with almost no movement or transition between the two.  Even when the slams work properly, they still don't look very impressive at all.  And that's not even mentioning the framerate, which is markedly choppy, the collision detection, which results in major glitching (like getting stuck halfway inside supposedly impenetrable obstacles), and the in-level load times, which goof everything up.  Every time the music track cycles around, the load causes the graphics to hiccup for a second or two, which means you'd better not be trying anything complicated when the song ends.  Sound  Speaking of those songs, they're actually quite good, if you can stand the loading troubles they happen to cause.  I like Pennywise (even if they should have licensed their ~Down Under~ cover), I like ~Life Size Mirror,~ and I have a soft spot for ~Rock Superstar,~ the new Cypress Hill track that's in the game.  But I have Winamp for that sort of thing - music, again, is only fun if it accompanies a fun game.  The sound effects, meanwhile, aren't anything particularly special - thumps, tinny grinding noises, guitar chords to announce that you've grabbed an item, and otherwise nothing that you wouldn't expect. Buy Tony Hawk 2.  That's all there is to it.  It's too bad to have to say something like that about a game which had some promise, but MTV Sports Skateboarding is trying to do the exact same thing as Hawk - it just doesn't do it nearly as well.  It's good to know, though, that even though the MTV Sports name is getting off on the wrong foot, there are better extreme-sports games in the works from THQ.  Pure Ride is an excellent snowboarding game, and we have very high hopes for its TJ Lavin BMX game.  So pass on MTV Skateboarding, but keep THQ in mind as the season goes on.", "date": "Sep 13, 2000"}
