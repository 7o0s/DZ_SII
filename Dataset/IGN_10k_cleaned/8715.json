Running out of steam? Not exactly. This time around, the questions are strictly music-related, providing mobile entertainment for the audiophile and music lover in all of us.   There's not much need to explain the Millionaire phenom -- it was a national obsession. Answer a series of questions and win money. As you progress up the ladder of questions, they become increasingly obscure and difficult, making it that much less likely that you'll actually get to that top tier of winnings. There aren't any actual cash prizes involved in the mobile game -- it's something the game must point out as it boots up, meaning somewhere out there, at one time, some Millionaire video game player got a wise idea.   Since the game deals specifically with music, it holds a lot of appeal to music buffs yet still provide quite a bit of challenge due to its eclectic assortment of questions. The game deals with subjects pulled from the entire music world from the technical aspects of music to foreign instruments. Questions zero in on movie and television soundtracks and popular music, too, including acts like the Beatles, Tina Turner, Jay Z, and Avril Lavigne, making for some good fun.   To help you answer these questions comes the mainstay of the Millionaire series -- the lifelines -- and it would seem that they're pretty dang reliable. For the vast majority of the time, when you use your phone call or audience poll lifeline, they tend to be right, but that's not to say that they offer the correct answer 100 percent of the time - they provide a wrong answer every now and again. For Music Edition, a new lifeline has been added: When you get to the $50,000 question, a ~Change Question~ lifeline pops up, allowing you to switch out a question for a different one. It's not revolutionary, but it is certainly nice to see some updates made for the new game.   The biggest issue with the game lies with the limitation of questions. Millionaire: Music Edition sports about 1,000 questions, which may really appeal to those entrenched in the music scene, providing some entertainment when played every once in a while, but after only playing a handful of matches, I saw a handful of questions repeat themselves. That's too soon. Maybe it was just some strange technical issue issue during my play sessions, but out of a potential 1,000 questions, to see repeats right away was troubling.Capcom isnt out to reinvent the wheel with its addition to the Millionaire series, providing exactly what the franchise is known for while appealing to a specific audience with a focus that makes it that much more appealing. The biggest issue is that it doesnt really offer much in prolonged entertainment  if you play through it back to back to back, youre going to see the same old questions over and over again, quickly creating a tedious experience. Though it isnt a revolution in gaming by any stretch, it does provide some amusement in short bursts, and thats more than many games can boast.", "date": "Jun 28, 2007"}
