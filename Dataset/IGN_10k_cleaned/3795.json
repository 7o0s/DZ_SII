Today, we're giving you the review of the second of these expansions called Disciples II: Servants of the Dark, which focuses on the ~evil~ slap-happy races. Now, you may notice some similarities between the two reviews. This is because I feel virtually exactly the same way about the two expansions because there are no real differences aside from the campaigns, further solidifying my belief that these are a bit of a raw deal for owners of the original game. While both of these expansions add new campaigns and story and even a couple of new features, I can't tell you that this expansion pack is a great deal for fans of the game or beginners due to its price and lack of new and substantial gameplay additions.   What you should know about the Servants of the Dark and Guardians of the Light packs are that they're stand-alone packages with the original game inside. So not only are you getting an expansion, you're getting the original, so it's more like a gold edition. That's pretty cool for new players, but leaves me wondering whey they didn't just put both of these expansions together and then come back with a gold edition that includes all of the above. Those that have already played the original game might find it hard to shell out 40 bucks to get both of the new expansions that are basically just new campaigns. Because this is a stand-alone expansion that includes the original game, I urge those that didn't already play it who are thinking about trying it out to read my review of Disciples II as well as this review. This review will focus nearly entirely on the expansion portions.   The story is set in the same world that has been torn apart by a war for control between the ambiguously good and not so ambiguously evil races occupying the realm. Servants of the Dark takes place directly following the rebirth of the Elf god into the world. After finally coming back to life and seeing that Mortis, his old goddess wife had gone quite insane by erecting an army of the undead just to get him back, he turned his back on her, disgusted. That doesn't make Mortis happy at all. You know what they say about a woman scorned, and when you add the powers of death and decay to her nagging and cunning repertoire, everybody in the path of woman is in serious trouble. So now the Elves are on her hit list, simply because her ex-hubby loved them so much. On the other side of the coin are the Daemons, who have been kept from bringing their lord and slayer Bngeneghhah... Bybxcaybgh... Balzatmthgha... sorry, hard to remember, Bethrezen back into this realm are unhappy as well, as Daemons like to be. But just because he hasn't been reincarnated doesn't mean they can't have a little bit of fun now does it? The eternal can afford to wait, even if they don't want to, so instead of coming back to run the show himself, Bataghthajhgaj tells his fiery phenoms to get to work burning everything to a crisp. Hell on Earth is the order of the day. Kill all that gets in your way in both of these high level campaigns and the day is yours.   The Servants of the Dark expansion features a bunch of additions, all the same as the Guardians of the Light, and still nothing that changes gameplay significantly. As I said for GoL, the only real addition that made much difference to me was the auto-resolve feature for combat. There are just some battles you know you're going to win (or lose) and being able to speed those up can save some time better spent making your next move on the map or getting into another more challenging fight.   Both of the campaigns in the game, featuring the Undead Horde and Legion of the Damned, are completely new with story and scenarios. The scenarios themselves are just as addicting and fun as they were before, but once again, there's really nothing new to play. No new units. No new gameplay elements that make a difference. It's even more of the same, which, as with GoL, isn't an entirely bad thing, it's just not as exciting as it might have been either.   All of the new campaigns in both of the expansions are high level. In order to play, you have to export a level 10 or above leader from the original Disciples II campaign. The bad thing for most fans of the game is that they've long since uninstalled and deleted their characters and heroes, as I had. Strategy First did take this into account and added a leader of each type for each of the four different races that are level 12, so you won't have to play through the first game all the way. The bad thing is that they're hidden on the CD so that you'll never be able to find them unless you read the readme file all the way to the end where it tells you how to include their pre-made high level heroes. Those that remember their heroes fondly will be able to change the name of the hero to whatever you like at the beginning of the campaign, so pretending it's your original hero won't be too hard.   My problem with these high level scenarios is the same problem I had with the rest of the game when it originally came out. You can only carry one leader over per level and no troops. So you have to go through the motion of building up troops each game, which is entirely annoying, especially when the whole map is littered with incredibly powerful creatures. Even sticking powerful units in with your weak ones to build them up can be a pain in the butt. Half the time they die anyway because they're seen as the weak link by the enemy AI. I really wish that they had figured out a way to ramp up the difficulty of scenarios differently so that you could bring more than one leader into the next round. This is really what made the difficulty level so high originally and continues on in that vein even with the easy setting.   Along with the new campaign come some new scenarios, multiplayer maps, and a random map generator. Although, frankly, I think that description is more than a bit deceptive. In order to get a random map to play on, you'll have to enter the scenario editor - that's right, you can't do it in the game - and create a new map and then randomize it. It isn't entirely random either; you still have to pick the number of cities, mines, crystals, enemies, and more. Every time I've seen a random map generator advertised before, it's been with the understanding that it randomized a map on the spot with only a number of players and a map size (which now can get up to 120x120 and 144x144 by the way).    One thing that you can be certain that you'll still enjoy is the art. Everything is just as beautiful as it was in Disciples II: Dark Prophecy. The fantastic art is just as fantastic as it always was. The year in between the original and these expansions did nothing to diminish the skill and beauty the art team managed to squeeze into this title. There is not a turn-based strategy game out there that can compete on this level. Obviously, the announcement that higher resolutions were going to be supported (the original release only supported 800x600) made me pretty happy. But low and behold, once I found the option to change the resolution (which also can't actually be done in the game) I found that the resolution only actually increased for the map, not the rest of the game. The battles, cities, army management, and even the menus are still actually in 800x600. The game just puts these portions in a smaller window when leaving the overland map. That's lame. You can actually get this windowed screen to stretch to cover the entire screen at higher resolution, but it doesn't look as good as it does in plain 800x600. This is another misleading claim that is sure to stink to a number of fans looking forward to the art in higher resolutions. I still can't very much fault the original game itself, and those gamers out there that are looking for good turn-based strategy games that haven't tried Disciples II: Dark Prophecy could definitely do worse than buying Servants of the Dark or the previously released Guardians of the Light. It just still really sucks that they're making players that already spent their hard earned money on the original game shell it out two more times for each of these if they want to play through all of the sides in the expansion stories. They didn't need the original, and paying that much money for two campaigns and what amounts to a regular patch is not cool. It all could have easily been included in one expansion pack. I really expect more for this kind of money. And really, you can find Disciples II: Dark Prophecy for ten bucks at most stores if not under that. So if you're looking for a real bargain that may be the way to go. Either way, veteran players are kind of getting the shaft with this brilliant money making scheme that Strategy First is pulling with these expansions. If they were both together for twenty dollars along with a real random map generator and complete upgrade in resolution, I would be much more inclined to recommend it just as an excuse to get back in and play more. As it is, only new players and veteran fans who have taken up smoking crack to fill the void of no Disciples II will want to shell out the money for each of these expansions.
