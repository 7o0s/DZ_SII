{"name": "Rainbow Six: Black Thorn", "name_review": "Rogue Spear: Black Thorn", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/14/rogue-spear-black-thorn", "text": "In the final months of development for Covert Ops the gang at Red Storm told me that that would be the last title to use the Rogue Spear engine. Given the appearance of Black Thorn, the new stand-alone mission pack for Rogue Spear, that statement appears to have been a misfact. But rather than being frustrated or hurt by this misunderstanding I'm grateful to have one last chance to run through a few missions before Red Storm moves on to a more current technology base. You hear me, Red Storm?  I was tempted to just copy and paste our Urban Ops review here with a little ~find and replace~ editing. Really, there's very little that's new here. It's the same engine and the same situations all over again. But given how much we loved Rogue Spear, that's not a bad thing. Except that between the time Rogue Spear was released and today we've seen SWAT 3, Operation Flashpoint and Ghost Recon which have upped the ante somewhat in terms of both technology and design.  In any case, Black Thorn is enjoyable. I have the same problems with ignoring the story as I did with the previous games. I mean, I'm sure the designers have taken the time to craft a really engaging story, but it seems kind of incidental to the game itself and it's far too easy to completely ignore it. Instead you craft a context for the missions (which is flimsy enough as it is) that keeps things tied together.  The important thing to note is that you'll travel to several locales in an attempt to kill terrorists. You begin by rescuing a Japanese ambassador, assaulting terrorists on a cruise ship and, most frustratingly, trying to snipe some guy driving a bus. In and of itself, that's not too much of a problem but it's one of those missions where you're not allowed to be shot at. Once the terrorists shoot at you, the bus takes off. Thankfully most of the other missions seem more achievable.  Once you're past the horror of the African bus mission, you'll visit jungle camps, hospitals, train depots, bus terminals and a hotel.  Planning is still a pain in my ass. The same interface is still being used and, even if it is practical, it's still a huge hassle to get anything done. And once you've spent the time to plan out the mission, you're locked into those decisions (assuming you don't take direct control of every team you've assigned). Since I still play the game the way I played Rainbow Six, this isn't much of a problem for me. I just take each fireteam through the level personally.  But even when you're taking the teams through one by one, you'll find a few problems. For one thing, the collision detection system causes your teammates to get stuck in the environment. When time is of the essence you don't necessarily have time to keep backtracking to show your teammates how to walk around a tree. And then there are the objects that the squad can walk through but shouldn't. There's a glass-walled weight room on the cruise ship and if you get out the door and cut left or right too quickly your guys will just run through the glass wall to get to you. Good thing we didn't need to be quiet or anything. Enemy AI is pretty unforgiving but still seems a bit static and scripted.  After seeing more recent games, the graphics in Black Thorn seem pretty average. The texture work and models aren't as detailed as they could be. But, given the relatively low system requirements, you should have no trouble pumping the resolution up to ridiculous levels. Even so, you'll still notice the edges of the sky box a little too often. The engine has always had more than its share of clipping and collision problems and Black Thorn continues the proud tradition of feet sticking through walls. Things aren't much improved in the sound department either. The engine does run a lot smoother this time around (I have upgraded my PC quite a bit since a year and a half ago, you know).  I'd be sure to get a whole batch of letters if I didn't include a list of the weapons available. There are almost a dozen new weapons here and, as usual, they're all modeled very accurately. The FAMAS G2 is just like the one I have at home. Acronymophiles will be happy with the other assault rifles in the game, the FNC and FAL. The SSG3000 sniper rifle provides a less intimate but equally effective solution for the agoraphobic among you. The small TMP and M12 machine guns are contrasted with the more lethal P90 and M60. On the pistol front you've got two new 9mm choices: the P-288 and the ultra-precise SPP. If penetration is your thing (and be honest now, who isn't in to it?) you should check out the 5.7mm Belgian pistol. If you don't like any of those, all of the old Rogue Spear and Urban Ops weapons are included as well.  The multiplayer side of Black Thorn is considerable. The nine campaign levels are supplemented by six dedicated multiplayer maps featuring a range of locations. You've got your junkyard, your office building, your Alaskan base and three others. You can play in the six old modes -- assault, lone wolf, terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, recon and defend. There's even a new variant of lone wolf where all the players hunt a single player. Whoever takes out the lone player assumes his role and becomes hunted. It makes for some intense reverses. For even more longevity, the cool mission generator from Urban Ops has been retained. Everything runs on ubi.com which seems to be growing in popularity and running pretty smoothly.  In short, Ghost Recon is where gamers should be spending their time and money. Still, given the lower price point and lower system requirements, Black Thorn will definitely find an audience among fans of the series (as long as they own Rogue Spear). But for gamers who have the hardware and the cash, Ghost Recon is still the better choice for people who are looking for something new.  -- Steve Butts      Want to share your opinions with the world?
