In last year's review of FIFA Soccer 07 for the Nintendo DS, we gave the game a well deserved thumbs up for its continuing evolution of soccer on the handheld, but we noticed one thing missing: online support. With the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection growing in support in late 2006, it was a little disappointing to see that Electronic Arts and its DS developers hadn't yet jumped enthusiastically into the online arena for the portable. That's all changed in 2007, and FIFA Soccer 08 puts much of its attention into supporting worldwide competition over the Internet. But that year in development also means tweaks to the core game mechanic, which means much tighter gameplay and a more thorough soccer experience.    FIFA Soccer, and pretty much all Nintendo DS sports games in general, will never meet the same standards that Electronic Arts is putting into current and last generation consoles due to cartridge and hardware limitations. But each and every year Exient - EA's go to team for pretty much all its key sports franchises now - manages to squeeze out a few extra tweaks and abilities into its engines to make the successive version a marked improvement. FIFA Soccer 08 might still use much of FIFA Soccer 07's engine and design for its starting point, but this year's game is a significant jump in product, way more so than FIFA 07 was over FIFA 06.   First, you got it: it's the premiere DS FIFA game to hit the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. It's certainly not the first soccer game to do it (Konami's vastly inferior Winning Eleven DS beat it to market), nor is it the first Electronic Arts sports game to support the service - Exient had already worked on Madden NFL 08 and Tiger Woods PGA 2008 for the Nintendo DS and put the online features in. The experience in those past games definitely worked to FIFA 2008's advantage as this soccer title not only features Friend and random player match-ups, you can download updated rosters off of EA's servers and create and trade custom scenarios across FIFA DS players. And as long as you link up with someone that's somewhat local (i.e. stay away from overseas) the link is relatively lag-free and nearly as good as you'd get in the game's excellent local wireless modes that support both single and multi-card features.   But the focus didn't just stop at an online experience: FIFA Soccer 08 on the Nintendo features tweaks throughout the product. The gameplay definitely feels tighter and more fluid over last year's game, with both computer opponent and teammate AI behavior being a lot more realistic for the 2008 season. The presentation also received a boost in visuals with more detailed texturework (mostly in the faces) and smoother transitional player animation, as well as improved dynamic camerawork after a particularly awesome or impressive play. And, of course, there's the play-by-play commentary that's been bumped up; the DS development team add more things for the commentator to say during the action. Naturally he stays away from player specifics but even without them it really sounds like he's keeping up with the action with fresh lines of dialogue.   Classic FIFA gameplay, with new touch screen elements.   And then there's the new DS focus. The game's still mostly controlled using the D-pad and action buttons, but in transitional plays like free kicks and penalty kicks, the action boots to specific ~mini-game~ style controls that use the Nintendo DS system's touch screen and stylus control. For penalty shots on offence, for example, players flick the  stylus upwards with a left or right curve to spin the ball in its shot. On defense, it's a simple ~block this area~ control on the touch screen. These new elements are slightly gimmicky but they're pretty unintrusive, fun, and far better tweaked than some of the unnecessary touch screen items that Exient created for the team's Madden DS products.   Though we're pretty excited to see the advancements that the development team put into FIFA 08, we do have to put it in perspective: it's still soccer on the Nintendo DS, and it'll never take the place of playing the sport on the more powerful current generation console systems. Of course, if all you've got is a Nintendo DS, FIFA Soccer 08 is a fine sports game and shows that even with the limitations of the hardware, put the right team on the job and convince the publisher to pour enough budget into the product (right down to the media size of the cartridge as well as how much data it can save) and you can get a sports experience on the Nintendo DS that approaches the big boy games.Exient continues to impress us with every successive sports product it produces on the Nintendo DS for Electronic Arts, and FIFA Soccer 2008 is definitely the team's best portable effort to date. The team's nailed soccer, football, golf, and even racing with last year's Need for Speed DS game. It makes us believe there's some hope for the possibility of other EA sports franchises for the Nintendo DS. In other words, EAfor the love of god put these guys on NHL for the handheld.", "date": "Nov 3, 2007"}
