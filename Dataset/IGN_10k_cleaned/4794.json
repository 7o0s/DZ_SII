Latest case in point: Shrek 2, from Activision and Skyzone. Does Dreamworks' $300 million ogre fare well on the smallest of small screens?Features:Board game ~action~Six mini-gamesTrivia from the moviesPretty much every genre has been attempted on cellphones now -- fighting, driving, sports, et al. However, the video board game, a category almost single-handedly invented by Nintendo's Mario Party franchise, has yet to really be represented in the wireless world. Enter Shrek 2, which plops up to four gamers on a winding board and, between rolls of the dice, casts them in mini-games based on movie sequences.  The initial problem with Shrek 2 is that the board is unreadable. You roll the dice and move your game pieces around the snaking paths, landing on squares that trigger events, but you never know what you're getting into until you actually land on the square and the game indicates whether you've lost a turn, get to roll again, or play a little trivia game for bonus points. Now, once you roll the dice, your landing spot is a foregone conclusion, but it would still have been nice to actually have a head's up as to what is about to befall your game piece.  In addition to the little trivia challenges, Shrek 2 contains six mini-games derived from the movie. You engage in a food fight with Fiona's kingly father, ride a carriage while Donkey tries to gobble apples, catch potions in a basket at the Godmother's factory, and deal with Puss-In-Boots.  None of these mini-games are very well done. The secret of Mario Party's success was that at least half of the mini-games were incredibly addictive little twitch sequences. Catching potions and eating apples? Shrek 2 could be the first game that cures insomnia while inducing carpal tunnel.  It says a lot about a game when the best parts are the text-based trivia challenges. They're not necessarily hard, but at least they're interesting. The rest of the game is just too formulaic -- your basic board game with Shrek 2 elements dropped in. At least Lavastorm's King Arthur countered its formula with fast-paced, fun gameplay.  ~Shrek 2~ the movie is gorgeous. Shrek 2 is average to the core. The mini-games feature clear representations of the movie characters, but their surroundings? Cookie-cutter. (Although, the carriage ride mini-game does feature leaves wafting by the screen.) The music is pretty good, but it would have been better to have heard some voice samples or bodily functions. Shrek 2 is obviously geared for younger players, but chances are, this game will never reach the hands of its audience. And I cannot imagine three other people I could corral into spending more than a few minutes humoring me by playing a cellphone board game. As such, it's hard to recommend Shrek 2 to anybody -- even the franchise's biggest fans. Save the few bucks to put toward Activision's commendable Shrek 2 console game, which kids will enjoy far more.", "date": "Jun 19, 2004"}
