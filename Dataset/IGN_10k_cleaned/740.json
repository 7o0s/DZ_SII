Naturally, this makes the task of creating an accurate simulation of the sport near impossible. But the Game Boy has never been about accuracy, at least in the sports arena. The format is not designed to carry off complex animations and accurate AI. However, that  doesn't mean a sports game cant be fun (see: Mario Golf). Would somebody please tell that to THQ and EA before they conspire to bring us another FIFA 2000?FeaturesFive play modesMore than 50 teamsPassword saveFor Game Boy and Game Boy ColorEA's console FIFA titles have always been highly-anticipated. FIFA soccer was an old standby--a solid, fun, easy-to-control soccer game for fans and non-fans alike. I definitely fall heavily on the fan side, but know plenty of gamers who enjoy FIFA when they  wouldn't dream of even watching a soccer game on TV. So whats wrong with the Game Boy version? Have they missed the point of soccer? Yes. They seem to have grasped that soccer is played by maneuvering a ball primarily with the feet on a large, grass field. They've taken note of the fact that contests usually take place between men from different countries. They've included a ball that is remarkably similar to a soccer ball. Theyve even managed to put goals on opposite ends of the field.But the game misses the point in every other area that matters. There is no reliable passing in FIFA 2000. There is no reliable shooting in FIFA 2000. There is no strategy. There is nothing that makes soccer the sport that it is. But I'm getting ahead of myself.The game begins to disappoint before you even make it to the field. Screen after screen of copyright gobbledygook drags out the boot to epic proportions. Now I'm all about giving developers, publishers and licensers credit. Just not for forty-five minutes.When you finally make it into the game menus, there are actually a lot of options. The main menu allows you to jump right to a quick match. Or you can manipulate music, SFX, control , crowd and animations in the Game Setup Menu. The Options panel lets you control fouls, stamina, weather, wind and half length, but has no setting for difficulty. And the preset difficulty is far too easy. Choose between several different game modes: exhibition, tournament, indoor, league and playoff. The tournament and league modes provided the most intrigue for me. And you can save your progress in league and tournament play (by writing down a string of code two full screens wide). The indoor game is akin to playing dodgeball in a closet.Once you select your game mode, you can choose one of 62 international squads, or the THQ Tornados, supposedly an All-Star squad. Unfortuately, this game does not utilize kit clashing or home/away gear. If you have a traditionally red team playing another traditional red team, guess what? Youll have no idea who is on your team. And playing Northern Ireland is a trip. Their uniforms are the exact color of the pitch, so it looks as if you're taking on a bunch of haircuts and shoes.The controls are simple but frustrating. The A button controls sliding, speed burst and shooting. The B button controls passing on offense. Tap it to dribble, hold it a bit longer for a medium pass and hold it still longer for a long-range chip or cross. This control is tough to master, and ultimately not worth it. It's not like you have a heck of a lot of control who the ball is going to anyway. On defense, use B to switch players. The reason the controls are so crazy-making is that the computer-controlled players in FIFA 2000 don't behave in a manner consistent with any kind of soccer played on this planet. The midfielders simply dribble up the field until they are stripped of the ball. Once in awhile they will attempt a long pass down the middle. No controlled passes. No crosses. Headers are rare. If they do get lucky enough to put a ball on goal, the goalie magnetizes to it. Playing defense has nothing to do with marking men. It's hard enough to select the player you want. When you finally do take control, the only way youre going to be able to get a ball away from an opposing player is by slide-tackling him. Hopefully, youll come up with the ball. Otherwise, it takes you so long to get up, your opponent is well on his way to the goal.On offense, you have just as few options. Try to pass and your pass will be intercepted. If it isn't, the player who received it will immediately be slid and denuded of the ball. If you try to dribble past defenders, they will steal the ball. Therefore, the entire contest is a series of speed runs to the player with the ball in order to slide him. Then, the second you get the ball you better boot it, because youre going to lose it anyway.The game dynamics and control scheme are unnerving. The only way to score is to do a series of slide-tackle robberies/dumps, then scramble for the ball and try to find a crease to the goal. This said, once you master this tactic, the game becomes relatively easy (although still not goal-plentiful). The opposing team  won't be able to score on your stick-um goalie, and you can capitalize on your two chances a game to win 1-0. Here's something that should never happen, especially in a game without variable difficulty: the first time I played a tournament, I won. The first time I played a league, I finished first. And I was using Bosnia and Lithuania, respectively. This is unacceptable. I like to beat a game as much as the next guy, but I like to earn it.In the end, the only way the game manages to be fun is if you imagine it as a sort of hybrid rugby-soccer game where the object is slide-clobbering your opponents. Occasionally, since it is rare, it feels really good to score as well. But I felt as if I were triumphing over the controls more than anything.  The straight dope: FIFA 2000 is a weak effort that does not live up to its name. A total overhaul should be in order if FIFA 2001 is planned.", "date": "Feb 29, 2000"}
