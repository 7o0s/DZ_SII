So, it shouldn't be that hard to craft a good tennis game for a handset -- the simple gameplay ought to be a perfect fit for the limits of a cellphone.     Features: Classic tennis Earn skill points to beef up your player Ranking ladder  Tennis 2003 is a port of a Korean tennis game, brought Stateside by nGame Ltd.  And you know, what?  They should have left it there, because this is an absolutely abysmal tennis game that has the potential to turn people off from the sport for good.  Everything about the game is sub-par, from the visuals to the control -- and especially the ball physics -- and work tirelessly against the glimmer of hope you pray is around every corner.  The game starts out on the right foot.  You are the descendant of a famous tennis family that must eliminate nineteen opponents to earn back the family honor.  Right on, that's SEGA-like story for you.  Too bad SEGA-like gameplay doesn't follow.  Everything from serving to returning is a chore, thanks to incredibly slow-moving players and a ball that just never quite acts right.  (Take ~ball~ with a grain of salt, because it's really just a yellow block.)  Your racket has so few frames of animation, and your player's head is so monstrous, that it's nearly impossible to line up return volleys correctly.  You're never quite sure if you're in the right place, because when you swing, it almost looks like the block, uh, ball went right through the strings.  Should you actually manage to beat not just your opponent, but the urge to immediately delete Tennis 2003, you earn skill points that you can apply to your character's speed and power.  The only thing that would have helped was if you could cash points in for a small head or faster-moving racket.  You never like to just level the word ~sucks~ at a game without qualifiers, but with so much going wrong in Tennis 2003, it's easier just to says the whole game sucks.  The graphics are old and ugly, with a ball that isn't a ball, bland courts, and players with fewer frames of animation than Howard Dean.  The control is turgid and difficult.  Moving around the court requires you to lay on the keypad like it owes you money.  And the ball physics -- if there are any -- are so off-kilter, you never know if a ball is going to go over the net or just drop into the net.  Face it, there is no fun to be had here.  Tennis 2003 is available on Verizon's Get-It-Now service, but we prescribe that you Get-It-Never.Well, after getting our game on with Sorrent's excellent FOX Sports Football and Basketball, we were hoping nGame Ltd's Tennis 2003 would continue the high.  And then we DL'd it.  Wowza, what a buzzkill.  Awful, slow action and horrid control deep-six this tennis game faster than you can say, ~What the deuce?~", "date": "Jul 15, 2003"}
