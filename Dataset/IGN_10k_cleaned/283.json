If you're into that whole strikes and spares deal, you're probably interested in which one is the better version. Well, read on, my faithful pocket reader, and find out which Game Boy Color cartridge should end up in your equipment bag with your oddly colored shoes and dirty white towel.   Features One or Two players Rumble Cartridge For Game Boy or Game Boy Color   10-Pin Bowling is as basic as you can get on the Game Boy. The only options you have are one or two players. Then, boom. You're in the game, bowling. No tournament options, player choices, left or right handed, no nothing. Just a straightforward game of standard, ten frame, ten pin bowling.   And if you thought the options were limited, check out what you do in the game to throw. Simply put, you align the arrow where you want to stand. Hold the A button to start the shot bar -- as the bar increases, you can set the speed of the ball as well as the curve. You'll have to let go of the A button before it goes in the red, otherwise it's considered a foul. This game was not made to represent the intricacies of the sport, that's for damn sure.  Just as the game is entirely basic and stripped down, so is the pin physics. Instead of the pins reacting individually, there's a handful of generic pin-action animations when the ball hits the grouping. I'm sure the programmers calculate the lie of the pins after the ball hits, but you'd never see it since the animation is simply a one-or-two frames of the mob of pins hitting each other. So if you want to try and slide the six pin over to nail the 7 pin, forget it. You'd never see it happen.  Is that it? Yup. There are no other options or features in this Game Boy Color title.  Don't bother picking up this game if you're looking for a bowling game  either arcade, realistic, or otherwise. There's a better option out there than this basic Game Boy Color title: it's Pocket Bowling from Jaleco.", "date": "Oct 4, 1999"}
