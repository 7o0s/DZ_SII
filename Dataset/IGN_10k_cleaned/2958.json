With such slight modifications made to the simplest of categories, your experience can go from a god-awful bore fest to bona fine fast-paced entertainment in the blink of an eye. It's a fine line that separates the two, as only the proper amount of tweaking and testing can determine which is the best way to go. ~Should our game be like a simulation, or should it be more like the arcade?~ It's a question asked by many a developer before, and one that EA Sports has seemed to finally found the answer to.   Taking elements from both categories, NASCAR Thunder 2003 is an effective amalgamation of the simulation and arcade aspects. Promoting the realistic side of the sport in terms of presentation, car models, physics, and season structure, the true-life fans should be an ecstatically happy bunch. On the flipside however, Tiburon has also managed to snare the arcade guys with unlockable bonuses, hidden characters (rest your soul, Earnheardt Sr.), and a fast paced, overly forgiving crash engine that will allow even the most impatient of curious racers get into this little thing called NASCAR.   Features  Career Mode: Deep career mode includes 20 successive seasons; now you will need to manage four major components while building a racing care.   Compete for top sponsors, the best crewmembers, and the latest racing technology  Lightning Mode: More than 30 MRN ~Moment of the Race~ scenarios featuring memorable action from actual NASCAR races; each scenario is presented by the NASCAR driver involved in the race scenario; the player relives the moment and either changes history or preserves it  Thunder License: With interactive instruction from the best NASCAR drivers, you will get behind the wheel of your own NASCAR ride and learn the driving lines, brake points, and all the nuances to develop from an entry-level driver to a pro  All-new game engine: New engine features more realistic vehicle dynamics, including tire grip and wear patterns, handling and suspension behavior, and collision physics; fun entry-level control with progression to deeper ~simulation~  New Tracks: Introducing six new infield road courses and one new superspeedway. All 23 NASCAR Winston Cup tracks can be raced with 14 tracks featuring both day and night racing; now also includes the Daytona Beach road course (circa 1950)  Amazing Visual Effects: Spectacular crashes; blown tires shred; car fragments and sparks fly; car parts on the track will damage vehicle if struck. Dust whipped up as car dives low/high in corners; shadows cast by track objects visible on car bodies  NASCAR Pageantry: Motion captured victory lane celebrations include driver celebrations, trophy moment and fireworks; dramatic pre-race camera fly-bys build emotion  Thunder Plates: Earn license plates during game play and unlock new features, including drivers, tracks and videos  Sense of Speed: Greater volume of trackside items, more things ~flying~ by; more shadow reflections on the car bodies and track surface; dynamic chase camera compresses/regresses according to deceleration and acceleration  Quick Cautions and Pit Mistakes: accelerates the time a caution takes and adds a TV style recap of the cause. Pit crew mistakes will happen from time to time and can affect the outcome of a raceGameplay  EA sports' games this year have been as aggressive as they've ever been, and Thunder is no exception. An easy to race quick play and the ability to zoom through 20 consecutive 32-race Winston Cup seasons is enough to keep even the pickiest of feature hounds busy for sure, but Tiburon has gone beyond even that. Including an excellent tutorial mode called ~Thunder License~ that teaches new players how to race from the ground up, the developers have attempted to welcome as large an audience as possible. And yet they still weren't finished.   As they've also added seven additional courses, with six of them falling under the infield road category (can you say Daytona Beach circa 1950?) and the last qualifying as a Super Speedway. Piled on top of last year's tracks (which have all made a return appearance), that's a total of a hell of a lot of courses, and with day and night racing an option on everyone -- it'll take quite some time before you've raced everything the game has to offer.     Other neat little features, like create-a-car, 200 plus different skins for existing autos, actual pit mistakes in the heat of a race, and an improved physics engine add a lot to an already cool list of goodies. Having well over twice as many Thunder plates than last year and an overly fun multiplayer mode doesn't hurt either.   The most important aspect of any gaming experience, Thunder plays brilliantly. Difficult but not impossible, the clever A.I. opponents nudge and bump you whenever and wherever they can, and clutter together like hungry rats after garbage when you're on a stride and about to pass them. More forgiving in terms of damage that you can sustain to your car before being run off of the road, you could try and barrel through them, but nine times out of ten you'll pay for it and end up farther behind instead of ahead of them pack.   What the game has you decide to do instead is use strategy to overcome them. Whether you're racing a five-lap contest or 100, a specific and adaptable approach to bunch-ups and traffic jams are the only way you can finish within the top 15 spots. So while Thunder may not rely on gear shifting, overdraft, and other such factors as much as say, Gran Turismo (don't worry though, all that stuff is still in there), the spot at which you aim your car and the subtlety of your placement makes just as big a difference here as it does in Polyphony Digital's big name racer.   It's this extra step that really made a difference to me compared to other driving titles. There are tons of games out there that just ask you zoom around in circles and do nothing but press the gas as hard as you can while braking only occasionally. In NASCAR Thunder, you can't always rely on the fact that you know where you're going to save you. There are 43 other opponents on that track who want the same thing you do... to win.   Should you want to win however, you'll need to grow accustomed to the controls which are almost identical to last year's version of Thunder. Reliant on constant taps of the analog or digital pad rather than a constant manipulation of the stick, timing, accuracy, and anticipation are the areas that aspiring Andretti's will need to work on. It's all rather intuitive, and with higher quality steering wheels (like the Logitech Gran Turismo Force Feedback), it's almost like you're driving the real thing.   Hardcore fans will undoubtedly be drawn to the career modes and Thunder plates that can be earned through good performance, and well they should be. Hidden cars, extra skins, and added characters are but a few of the just rewards waiting for you at the other end of the tunnel. And while we're sure that some people out there won't know how to take the fact that the late Dale Earnheardt Sr. is in the game as a hidden driver, it didn't bother me in the least. He was a great driver and a great man, and seeing Electronic Arts honor him in this way is no different than seeing the late ~Sugar~ Ray Robinson in Knockout Kings or Babe Ruth in Triple Play.     Graphics  Matching the feature set in terms of improvements, the visuals are bordering on incredible. Just slightly above average in 2002, the team has really turned things around here and it shows. While plagued with a touch of our evil nemesis, ~the jaggies~, the rest of the game looks amazing -- With the lighting effects in particular standing out as the absolute best in the genre. Taillight trails, headline marks, and other sourced lighting issues are everywhere. So well done in fact, that driving towards the sun in a direct parallel line will result in almost blindness.   Every car in the race can be seen onscreen at the same time just like last year as well, but this time around there's far less slowdown than in 2002. Additionally, there's a hell of a lot more detail on the cars, backgrounds, and pit crew than we've seen previously, and the framerate stays solid regardless of which camera angle you use (though, the cockpit view does have an occasional stutter). Truth be told, the graphics are huge step up and enough to get fans of last year's game excited on that merit alone.   Sound  Might I just say that NASCAR Thunder has some of the best music in a racing game that I've ever heard! Bold as that statement may be, it's an absolute fact. Not because of the heavy metal remix of ~Get Outta My Dreams~ or Nonpoint's rage-like ~Circles~, it's actually far simpler than that. As the real culprit behind that proclamation is ~Magic Carpet Ride~ from Steppenwolf. Completely appropriate for the Thunder setting and one of the most classic songs in the annals of modern music, you just can't beat it.   As for the quality of the rest of the audio, it's pretty high up there. Offering true Dolby Surround Sound and a multitude of effects, it sounds a full generation better than EA's last racing title F1 2002. Bone-crunching car wrecks, fighter jet engines, and pure NASCAR muscle are but a small example of the large audio bank that includes tire screeching, crowd cheering, and a National Anthem that would make domestic players proud.   The announcers fare a tad less convincingly, with an almost robotic reaction to what's happening. Though the team is a competent one, it appears that other than driver names and track conditions, they didn't record much by way of variety. So hearing something new each time out isn't exactly a forgone conclusion. It's just a minor complaint though, as your ears will be grateful with the total audio package.I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed NASCAR Thunder 2003. Not a big stock racing fan by any means, the user-friendly controls and interface along with an absolutely splendid presentation really helped draw me in, and I expect it will do so for the majority of console owners out there as well. The only real qualm I have is that the repetitiveness of racing in ovals and other similar shapes for countless laps over and over again, could wear thin after while. But with a high number of street tracks, ergonomic driving, and other plusses I mentioned elsewhere in the review, this is one racing game that I'd recommend to veterans and newbies alike without hesitation.", "date": "Sep 20, 2002"}
