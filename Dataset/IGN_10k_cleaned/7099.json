{"name": "Syphon Filter", "name_review": "Syphon Filter", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/02/18/syphon-filter", "text": "Syphon Filter is probably one of the weirdest names of any game on the PlayStation game this year, save Um Jammer Lammy (which takes the cake hands down). But don't let the name fool you.  As the second original game from 989 Studios this year (NCAA Final Four was the first), Syphon Filter implements a level of stealth and skill-based action that is hard to come by in a PlayStation game. Yes, Metal Gear Solid and Tenchu are awesome games, but this is different: it blends even more game aspects into its core to make it something special, and it's not from the big-name Japanese companies.   In Syphon Filter you star as a special agent Gabe Logan, part of the mysterious ~Agency.~ The game immediately highlights Gabe as a kind of movie star-like Bond figure in the beginning, and partners him with a female agent, Lian Xing. While out on missions, Lian Xing will contact and inform you as to how to proceed. She's a help, but she's not much on action. But the story tells of how the two of them discover a destroyed chemical lab deep in the hear of Central America and how they learn that much of the lab's valuable contents have been stolen. It turns out that terrorists have stolen a dangerously powerful chemical weapon from within the labs that could kill millions almost instantly. And it's your job to find -- and take down -- these clowns before they wipe out Washington DC.   The game's camera perspectives are exceptional. You'll play the whole game from the third-person angle, but depending on the weapon, you'll shift to first-person. A nice solution that was first implemented in the N64's Mission Impossible is used better here. When up against a wall, instead of seeing bad polygon glitches or invisible walls, Gabe's head turns invisible, enabling you to see right through it.   What you'll find in Syphon Filter is a phenomenal array of mission-based levels and situations in which you'll use all sorts of gaming skills to surpass the various obstacles. FMV is integrated seamlessly. You'll be happily surprised when an obstacle is met and the story progresses on. It's clear the folks at Eidectic studied games such as Rare's Goldeneye and Konami's Metal Gear Solid, but just as Shakespeare stole other authors' work, he made them better and unique. With Syphon Filter, you'll feel like you're playing a brand new experience.  Graphically, the game is a mixed bag. In some areas, the game is do dark it forces you to use the flash light. In others, it's just plain dark. Another little problem is the resolution. It's not by any means ~high,~ and can be annoying to the eye. And the frame rate isn't a problem, but it's not perfect, either. What Syphon Filter gives up in frame rate it provides in character and environment detail.   As situations and environments change, so do your objectives and the litany of weapons you'll find. In some cases, you'll simply need a couple of good automatics to handle the thugs that come across your path. In other scenarios, you'll need a smart sense of the grenades, the fantastic grenade launcher, or the specially-armed Sniper Rifle to pull off your task. In some cases, you'll need nothing but stealth. In the Catacombs you'll simply need to follow someone without being caught, which takes skill and practice.   The list of weapons and gadgets -- and their capabilities -- is truly awesome. There is the Silenced 9mm handgun, the .45 handgun, the G-18 Pistol-machine Gun, the BIZ-2 Pistol Machine Gun, the HK-5 Pistol Machine Gun, the Shotgun, the Combat Shotgun, the PK-102 Assault Rifle, the M-16 Assault Rifle, K3G4 Assault Rifle, the Sniper Rifle, the Nightvision Rifle, the Taser, grenades, Gas Grenades, C4 Explosives, M-79 Grenade Launcher, the Virus Scanner, the Flashlight, the Flak Jacket, the Keycard, and the Viral Antigen, not to mention secret weapons. The most surprising and certainly one of the important games of the year is 989 Studios' Syphon Filter. This hybrid of action/adventure and puzzler-solving aspects integrates well-balanced gameplay, FMV, and story plot lines like few before it. In fact, it's easy to say that while it borrows aspects from other games, it comes nowhere near close to feeling like any of them. It's a game in its own right, straight and simple.The stealth aspect of Syphon Filter is fantastic. Pure bliss. Metal Gear Solid and Goldeneye fans will absolutely dig the many mission objectives just within a single level, which are sometimes split up into two or three different parts. To be frank, this game will challenge you. It's not for the Mario Party gamer. You'll find that sometimes the level you almost completed relatively death-free will be more difficult the second time around. The AI changes, and cycles around in different ways to create surprise. Enemies will strafe and run from you, or hide behind trees or other safe objects, and they all carry different weapons, so you're never sure exactly how to approach them. Well, OK, it's not that hard. You'll know how to knock out an enemy once he's killed you, but you'll need to stay away from wanton, Quake-style free-wheeling killing runs. The selection of weapons is also prime. As suspected, you'll start out with just a few, and as you snoop around you'll pick up a lot of cool little surprises, such as my favorite, the M-79 (a grenade launcher), or the Nightvision Rifle. I'm still a shotgun man myself (hearkening back to the 'ol Doom days of yore), but I must say the Sniper Rifle is just killer. In one level, the Park, you'll need to free some hostages, and by using a combination of the Nightvision Rifle and the Sniper Rifle, you'll meet your objective. With the Sniper Rifle you can actually determine what kind of shot you'll take, such as a body shot or a head shot. Other levels broaden out the game's variety nicely, such as Rhoemer's Stronghold and The Catacombs, which are really a lot like Tomb Raider levels. You'll walk around and find secret stuff and be sneaky like. The level design is creative and almost never repetitive -- which is just what the true gamer really wants.", "date": "Feb 18, 1999"}
