Midway released Wayne Gretzky 3D Hockey almost the same time last year, a fast hockey game that emphasizes arcade action over realism. Heck, let's face it -- WGH was NBA Jam on ice. It was great fun, but it wasn't perfect -- die-hard hockey fans cried foul when playing the game in simulation mode. Realistic it wasn't, and it looks like Midway wanted to please the fans with its '98 update.  If you're a sim fan, prepare to be disappointed.  Very disappointed. Gamers expecting a full-fledged hockey title with Wayne Gretzky Hockey '98 are going to feel cheated and robbed. Wayne Gretzky Hockey '98 is, at its core, a repackaged, retitled edition of last year's hockey game. Everything in last year's version is in this year's, complete with the same graphics, animation, sound effects, and color commentary. The only change is in the gameplay, which we'll get to a little later on.  Let's start with the graphics -- the exact same (and we do mean exactly the same) arena textures and player images from last year have been moved into this year's edition. Nothing new has been added (OK, the Campbell's Soup and Coca Cola ads on the boards have been replaced by Mace and San Francisco Rush banners), and it's annoying to see that the same shadow-free and reflection-less ice rinks of last year have been brought over perfectly  in this version.  And let's not forget the empty claims: the promise of real uniforms on the box is totally incorrect. The only updates we've found are photos of every hockey player in the game (up to 17 on a team) and a new title screen.  Now for the sounds. Again, the same player grunts, oofs and ughs that slightly irritated us last year are back, and again nothing new has been added. The same announcer is back with nothing new to add. The famous quote ~Robin Hood and his Merry Men are up to it again~ has been thankfully deleted, but don't expect any new commentary this year. The music and organ tunes from Wayne Gretzky 3D Hockey are also exactly the same this time around, and nothing has been done to add variety to the repetitive skate and crowd noises of last year.  And now, we come to the actual gameplay. Midway promised improved player AI, something that's almost an empty claim: The ~here's an open net~ goalies from last year are now infallible supermen.  At the standard difficulty, don't expect to score. Really. If you do, it was a fluke. On the flip side, the actual players are still idiots, going offsides whenever given the chance. They play a bit more intelligently overall compared to last year, but these guys are no Wayne Gretzky (the player, not the game).  Other points to mention: the original Wayne Gretzky game just doesn't make for realistic hockey. These players look more like football players than hockey players, which gives this game a more animated, exaggerated feel.  The game is also slightly too fast for its own good, with the anti-gravity puck causing an unrealistic amount of icing calls. There are no delayed penalties, which is yet another thing stacked against the game. Called penalties don't tell what team is getting the disadvantage, and a cryptic number at the top of the screen is supposed to inform how much time the power play has left. And let's not forget the fact that the programmers didn't leave enough space for text  -- for example, cross-checking is called as ~xchecking.~ It almost looks like a text glitch.  Wayne Gretzky Hockey '98 has a rushed feel, inexcusable for a talented development team and a company who had a year to work on the game.  But let's check the other side of the spectrum -- some gamers don't care about the realism of hockey. If you take the game off the default ~simulation~ setting, the game plays a great version of last year's arcade game. The goalie is still a lot more difficult to trick, but point spreads still shoot in the high area. And the ability to change the arena size as well as 3-on-3, 4-on-4, or 5-on-5 matches, while nothing new to the series, adds to the fun of the game. And let's not forget the ability for up to four players to add to the fray, always a plus in any kind of game.  Yes, it's true. Last year, N64.com gave the original Wayne Gretzky 3D Hockey a rating of 8, and it deserves every single point. Does that mean that this year's version, arguably the same title brought out one year later, deserves the same score? Absolutely not. We don't recommend that you go out and spend the $60 to get a duplicate of a game you already own.  If you want to buy Wayne Gretzky Hockey '98 for a good, realistic game of hockey, or just because you own last year's game, don't. You'll be setting yourself up for a complete disappointment. On the other hand, if you missed out on last year's game and just want a pure action oriented hockey title, you can't do any worse, especially since this is still the only hockey game on the N64. It's a fun title if you take off all the rules.", "date": "Feb 26, 1998"}
