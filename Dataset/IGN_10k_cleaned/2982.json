In Conflict: Desert Storm those friends are the other members of your US Special Forces or British SAS unit that you'll have with you throughout the game. While the Xbox is going to see similar tactical shooters in the upcoming Brute Force and a pair of Tom Clancy themed games, Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield, Pivotal Games' Gulf War inspired game could very well have carved out a niche of its own by the time those higher profile games arrive. CDS doesn't have the polish or attention to detail that we're expecting from those other games, it's still a very accessible title that seems well tuned for play on the console.   The Features  Team-based action and stealth featuring four easy-to-control characters  Large detailed environments with smoke, heat haze, and shadows  Seamless movement between indoor and outdoor environments  Interact with helicopters, tanks and other vehicles  Reward system utilizing medals and promotions, plus the experience system allows soldiers to improve from mission to mission In-depth Artificial Intelligence governs enemy actions and fellow team members Stunning graphics and visual effects    Gameplay  The story of the Gulf War is an integral part of how gamers will approach Conflict Desert Storm. We're dropped into the Middle East on Aug 2, 1990, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait, and we're shown how a member of our commando unit has been captured by the occupying Iraqi military. You play most of the game with a team four specialists --an assault trooper, sniper, heavy weapons expert and a demolitions expert/medic-- but you pick up new members throughout each of the first four levels. You wont' have the benefit of the sniper, that very same commando that's been captured by Iraq, until you first rescue him in the game's first mission.  Even though there's a very comprehensive training mode, these initial levels where you're meeting up with your team members also ease you into the game's way of thinking. For example there aren't too many obstacles your main character, the assault trooper, can't handle but new challenges arise as you acquire your sniper, heavy machine gunner and explosives expert. With only 15 levels you would think this is a waste, but there's a surprising amount of gameplay, thanks to lots quick deaths, in Conflict Desert Storm.    The game is optimized for third person control on a controller so the majority of your time will be spent aiming and firing with the right trigger. But there are also extremely important inventory and team management functions that have been cleverly mapped to the Xbox controller. You can switch between any soldier in your unit at anytime by tapping on the D-pad and cycling to the one you want and you instantly see things from his perspective. This can be a little disorienting, especially if they're totally spread out and you haven't been keeping track of where they are. All of your squad commands are accessed by holding the left trigger and then hitting face buttons to select specific troops and issue orders to move, fire at will or hit the deck.   Troop Management  The amount of control you have over your squad-mates is surprising, all things considered, but it's a crucial part of a game like this. In combat situations you have the option of either taking control and moving your troops into position yourself and setting them up or simply issuing commands to the other guys to move into a position that you designate with a cursor and even choosing what direction you want them to face. All of this is done without ever switching from the third person perspective of the character you're controlling. The balance between moving guys yourself and issuing orders is one of the most appealing elements of the game. Your troops are obviously never as effective on their own using their own A.I. --even if it is some of the best A.I. we've seen since our marine buddies in Halo-- as they are when you're on the sticks, but as a field commander there are also times when you absolutely have to delegate authority. For example, it's always a good idea to send your sniper to a high position where he can cover your guys, but you'd better keep an eye on him with whatever character you're controlling so you can get him out of trouble.  The majority of missions involve neutralizing recognizable targets and securing real world areas related to Operation: Desert Storm. Before each mission you're given a briefing that details your objectives, how they relate to the greater war going on and even a realistic dates that corroborates the January/February 1991 ground war. We really enjoyed the mix of desert wilderness and small towns each mission presented even if they were more or less variations of the same thing: find and neutralize all tanks/SAM sites/SCUD launchers and get to the evacuation zone. Since there are only four in your party and each troop has a limited number of clips, grenades, health packs etc. strategy is paramount and each mission has its own specifics that you have to adapt to.  CDS forces you to use strategy like having all of your commandos give most of their health packs to the medic since he can use them most effectively or letting your heavy machine gunner pick up Iraqi heavy machine guns you discover since he's most qualified at using them.   This notion of specialization runs deep throughout the game. Your sniper begins with a three star rating at sniper weapons and will obviously get better the more he uses sniper weapons until he becomes a four star sniper. If you find a sniper rifle in an Iraqi weapons shack and pick it up with your medic, he literally may not know how to use it. If you equip the sniper rifle as the medic's main weapon, he'll do his best but his rate of fire and accuracy will be so poor that he's more or less useless to the team. If you insist on improving on somebody's weakness you can do it, but you'd better take special care of them since they'll be completely out of their element and the only time ratings are boosted is at the end of successful missions. Each commando receives experience points based on how active and involved they were, and with which items/weapons, in the previous mission.  CDS isn't one shot-one kill but when one of your commandos takes too many hits they lose all of their active health, become inactive and lay on the ground helpless rolling around in pain. You have a short time before their dark red ~total~ health bar completely drains away and they die. This makes the supply of health packs critical since somebody has to get to them before they kick the bucket. Pivotal Games's application of artificial intelligence comes through here because your guys will be smart enough to heal themselves if you're not controlling them, but if they run out of health packs, it's on you to revive them one way or another. Unfortunately, this game isn't at a level where you can issue a command to have somebody go heal another player. All you can tell them to do once they reach a location is to fire at will.   You rarely run out of ammo early in the game but roughly halfway though, you'll start to notice your assault trooper running low on ammo or your heavy weapons expert using up his anti-tank rockets rather quickly. Finding supplies in Iraqi camps and buildings is the only way to re-stock but using each commando for their specialty is the best way to conserve. When you find Iraqi bazookas and AK-47s you still have to put them in the hands of the guy that can use them best because there's a strong chance you're going to need those supplies immediately. Repeatedly putting your troops into position to cover one another, including you, and then charging in with your character for a frontal assault will work most of the time. However, the game does a good job of putting you in surprisingly tough situations that you can get out of if you use your wit.   A good example was a time when we were pinned inside an Iraqi communication center with an enemy tank waiting outside. The tank was going to move as long as my commandos were inside and we were fresh out of anti-tank rockets, and grenades do nothing to armor. Every time we even peaked out the door, the tank would unload on us and taking splash damage through an open doorway is costly. I had the idea of using my demolitions expert/medic to plant some C4 near the tank and set it off remotely. I set up an effective distraction with my sniper and quickly switched to the medic and ran towards the tank since the turret was facing the opposite direction trying to track the sniper. Once at the tank, the medic was inside the minimum firing radius, especially when we kneeled to plant the C4. Now that the explosive were armed it was a matter of getting to a safe distance so I could detonate it. A few head fakes to get the tank to fire its main gun and begin its slow reload cycle and my medic was back in a trench with the detonator in his hand. A press of the button and that tank was no more.   The multiplayer aspect of Conflict Desert Storm is a little disturbing because it simply puts each human player into the role of a commando.even ones that haven't joined the game yet. You can basically play through the whole game cooperatively on splitscreen but that means you'll need to be up to mission three before you'll have four playable characters. If you and a buddy begin the first mission, one of you will be on the left side of the screen playing as the assault trooper going to rescue the sniper in an Iraqi prison. The other will be the sniper in that Iraqi prison sitting a cell until he's rescued. Once the sniper is free, you can have some real fun, but who wants to sit through a whole level watching on half a screen while his buddy has all the fun? The sniper is controllable while he's in the cell, but there's not much to do besides lay down on the bunk and stand behind bars.  There are vehicles you can drive in Conflict Desert Storm but you don't get to the jeep and the tank until you're about 75% through the game. Each commando takes a position behind the wheel, at the passenger side machine gun and on the main gun with one guy just sitting in the back doing nothing. In the case of the Bradley armored fighting vehicle --you know the one that's too slow to be a scout, too flimsy to be armor, and too small to effectively move troops-- you get two guys on the main turret with one on the rocket launcher and one on the main heavy machine gun. Driving is not bad, but it's nothing like driving the Scorpion and the Warthog in Halo. Maybe that's why they save it till the latter half of the game.   Graphics  The best way to describe the look of CDS is effective. There's nothing particularly impressive about the characters, environments, animation or effects but they all work together to make the game look and feel like what it is: a tactical combat game.   Even though most of the game seems tuned for the console, the animation at times seems like it was designed for a mouse-and-keyboard control scheme. There can be a strange little hop step sometimes when your soldiers make sudden moves from side to side. It's the pacing of this quick move that's so upsetting because strafing in the heat of combat is slow and ineffective. But a game that's trying to capture the essence of the Gulf War can't straddle the line between realistic shooting and Quake 3 when it comes to character movement.  There are some nice touches animation-wise like the soldiers writhing in pain and raising their weapons to aim when you have them in fire-at-will mode. The movements of the Iraqis are extremely stiff. If this is indicative of that nations real life army it's no wonder why they were so soundly defeated 11+ years ago.   The characters in Conflict Desert Storm have intricate details as far as uniforms and specific weapons, but they aren't built of very many polygons. The fact that there are four of them isn't much of an explanation considering there's rarely more than 8 total characters on the screen at once.  The fact that you can transition seamlessly from outdoor to indoor environments shouldn't be overlooked. Running into a bunker from the desert will cause the camera to swoop indoors too but without ruining the ruining the perspective or composition of the scene. In fact, Conflict Desert Storm has one of the most functional cameras we've seen in a third person action game, because we rarely had to adjust or worry about getting the camera lost behind an object.   Sound  With better sound effects in Conflict Desert Storm we would've been immersed in Pivotal's take on the Gulf War. As they stand now, you can tell the difference between the American and Iraqi heavy machine guns for example but there still seems to be a lot of emptiness in the audio department. You can be right around the corner from an Iraqi tank and a couple of soldiers and not even know it until you walk out into an explosion of gunfire. They're not ninjas, and they're not in stealth mode. I'd like to think that an occupying force would make a little ruckus, saying their prayers or something, if they were within 2 miles of me blowing up a SCUD launcher with C4.  The directional sound is very mediocre. This game could've really benefited from full Dolby Digital support on the Xbox, but the center channel and subwoofer on the Cambridge Soundworks system we're running were doing nothing.    You will appreciate the way you can hear your unit's verbal prompts when they're taking fire or when an enemy has been neutralized. Since you're controlling them one at a time, they can often detect things you can't if you have them spread out. An audio cue is all you often need to know what direction you should head toward. I enjoyed Conflict Desert Storm because it had a nice balance of authenticity and accessibility. It was easier to pick up and get into than a Rainbow Six game mainly because you don't have to worry about mission planning and assigning weaponry and troops. I get my four guys, they've got their gear and it's up to me to get the job done with the tools I've got. Even with the substandard visuals and audio elements, CDS was enjoyable. But Xbox owners are surely used to a certain standard of technical excellence by now and I don't think this game lives up to what we've grown accustomed to in the first year of the system's existence. It occupies a special place in the Xbox library as the first game of its kind on Microsoft's console and for this reason is definitely worth a long look for those of you with money to spare before the big holiday rush of games. But the truth is, there are bigger name bigger budget titles just around the corner for those of you who can wait to get your tactical shooting on and it won't be too late to go back and get Conflict Desert Storm if we see they all measure up evenly.", "date": "Sep 26, 2002"}
