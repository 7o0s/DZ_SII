But, when a game's outstanding engine assists in delivering a truly atmospheric, immersive experience, it can often work to overcome minor faults present in gameplay. Ghosthunter has the technical brilliance down and the sometimes lacking gameplay. Even though the powerful technology behind this one may allow us to overlook a touch of redundancy and a few numbing puzzles, it's the atmosphere, the artistic flair, and the dramatic splash of style -- the experience -- that truly makes this a worthwhile purchase.    If you're into seriousness, stay away. This premise is wacky. As a Detroit police officer named Lazarus Jones, players are sent along with partner Anna Steele to investigate a purportedly haunted school that local construction workers are refusing to bulldoze because of its overt spookiness. After a brief look about, Lazarus pushes the big red button on what looks like a mystical jukebox and ghosts start flying all over the damn place. Directed by a floating digital head, he dons an outfit ravers would shame and becomes a Ghosthunter on a journey to reacquire and contain all of the specters he's unleashed so that he can eventually rescue his partner, who coincidentally found herself abducted by a scarred and lonely spirit.    As you might have guessed, Ghosthunter isn't always the fright fest we might have expected it to be. Instead, this game offers a wildly lighthearted, whimsical, and plain goofy trek that will suddenly switch gears to become something truly creepy. This swift, recurring, and very positive change in pace can be largely attributed to the technical achievement that is Ghosthunter and also to the artistic excellence found throughout the title.    Levels, first of all, do not load. Once you're in a zone, you're playing straight to the end (and it's a very, very long zone). The game also has a delightful tendency of not only offering a variety of fantastically disparate locales, but often times switching up the mood of different sections within these environments. Early in the game you'll find yourself traversing a putrid Louisianan swamp bathed in hues of green and brown and gold, but this changes from bayou to cemetery to shanty town to claustrophobic mine to plush mansion to rotten hell-shack just as quickly as the protagonist can walk. The way perpetually vivid imagery dynamically mutates from the absurd to the intentionally hilarious to the horrific in environments that go from traditionally horror-esque to outstandingly Alice really drives home a level of environmental diversity and intrigue that most titles never come close to approaching.      Though the adventure is entirely linear, and exploration is defined by strict paths and inoperable doors, it's this level of suddenly changing exploratory grace that immediately forces us to expect the unexpected. In a spiritually effed world there are no laws. So, rooms will change, corridors will loop, lights will swirl, houses will sink, and everything in the middle will just be darn weird, but amazingly appropriate -- a testament to the amount of care SCE Studios Cambridge put into level design. Truly top-notch stuff.    Of course, this plush design is only strengthened by one of the most impressive engines found on PlayStation 2. What Ghosthunter does for the eyes and ears, we simply do not see that often. Rare is the PS2 game that is this crisp, this well-defined, this polished, this flicker free, and this extravagantly detailed.     It's a marvel done by ballsy developers not afraid to craft a dramatic, sweeping cutscene with a variety of close-ups, pans, well-lit environments, and angles most game creators shy away from for fear of highlighting their title's glaring technical faults. I suppose it's actually not brashness, as Ghosthunter can get away with zooming in on its hero's head and showing off the wrinkling face of Lazarus, his stubble, Anna's freckles, the odd and bizarre structure of the hill folk, and the incredibly detailed effects we're hit with turn after turn after turn. Again, it's this marriage of artistry and technical sophistication that makes it all happen.         What the marriage doesn't make happen is gameplay. Ghosthunter is by no means fundamentally flawed or painfully redundant. It's just an underachiever. Control takes place in two forms: run about and combat. Running is a straightforward affair. One analog stick careens Lazarus about the environment while the other looks. When it's time to shoot something with one of the game's either totally grounded or totally absurd weapons, the camera snaps to a tighter over-the-shoulder perspective. Here movement is inhibited and the focus is on aiming and pelting. There's still enough speed to get around, but Lazarus no longer feels brisk, which helps establish a sense of dread when being bull-rushed by a massive materialized specter.    It's not this intentionally encumbered combat system that slightly depreciates the worth of Ghosthunter, but rather the way in which it's used. The combat here simply does not match the applied presentation value. What we have in terms of action is an affable, but repetitive affair with marginal challenge attached.    Enemies all have specific strengths and weaknesses, but discovering them is no harder than shooting and paying attention to the color of the reticle and the sound of a disgruntled hero. Interestingly, Lazarus will often have to deplete a foe's spiritual reserve before capturing him or it in a mystical boomerang grenade (another glorious visual effect). This initially limits the amount of ghosts he can effectively neutralize at any given time, but even the gimmick isn't enough. It's a gameplay style that's not terribly obtuse but oddly out of place, sort of like a Colonial Marine from Aliens using his hip-mounted mini-gun to mow down everything in sight. More emphasis should have been put on running and dodging and fearing these ghosts, opposed to slowly circle-strafing and pelting them with round after round of blue death.     Unfortunately, between these arguably average combat encounters come some consistently poor puzzles. Never throughout the course of Ghosthunter will the application of genuine thought be needed, which is never a serious qualm with action titles less they vainly implement some underdeveloped puzzles... Whoops.     Here, Lazarus walks a path, explores an environment, shoots a bunch of enemies, and then haphazardly stumbles into a dead-end, replete with spiritual conduit. With its glowing blue and white power he is able to summon the disembodied soul of Astral and float toward the only place we can float toward, initiate the only action we're supposed to initiate, and accomplish the only task that is to be accomplished. It's a trial that involves plodding movement and meticulous first-person scanning (not at all fun). As odd as the comparisons may seem, Project Eden and Prince of Persia should be prerequisites for any future game attempting to reincorporate the puzzler into the actioner.     But these problems -- an often undesirable kind of action and some more aggravating than awful puzzles -- never ruin an experience that's gorgeous, stylized, and well-cared for. This trait can be attributed to the game's incredible presentation with slick support for progressive scan, widescreen display, and a penchant for utterly astonishing graphics and superlative audio effects, but some credit must be given to the writers and actors. It's they whom deliver the zany and make it an experience worth playing past the cliched kidnappings and expected jaunts off to abandoned prisons. There's a warm, comfortable, relatable air about the different people you meet (especially Lazarus), and a real reason is provided to complete the title despite the fact that you will eventually run into another stupid spiritual conduit.   Workable but straightforward action marred only by some annoying puzzles isn't a bad thing. When you take that, combine it with likable characters, an interesting and ridiculous plotline, and some of the best visuals around, you get something that's great.It's gorgeous and well-produced. But, for almost as many times as it is exhilarating and awe inspiring, Ghosthunter is also mundane. This is an experience that shouldn't be casually disregarded by PS2 gamers looking for something new, but it's still not perfect. Buy into Ghosthunter and you'll be satisfied, just not for the reasons you thought you would be", "date": "Aug 13, 2004"}
