IWD and its freshly hatched sibling differ from the other IE-based games in several respects.  First, you create your entire party of six, rather than finding and adding NPCs to it.  Second, both IWD games are relentlessly linear, moving from one major quest to the next.  You can't pick and choose among a variety of major but nonessential quests.  You can choose between different sides in a few secondary IWD2 conflicts, but not to the extent that the Fallout series or Arcanum allows you to pursue two completely separate tracks of good and evil to win.   Both these factors have turned off some players in the past.  On the other hand, IWD provides an entertaining mix of abilities, spells and enemies.  It isn't the most colorful or original RPG out there, but it remains one of the best balanced, with a series of escalating challenges that keep the tension crackling throughout the entire game.  Icewind Dale 2 shares its predecessor's strengths, but makes a lot of changes to the underlying rules.  The game is arguably better for the differences, as you'll discover.    IWD2's New Stuff, Part the First: Third Edition   Much of what's new in IWD2 derives from the game's adaptation of AD&D 3E (third edition) rules.  These furnish a greater level of specificity in character design and development over the course of the entire game.  Let's take a look at some of these important new features, and see how they affect gameplay.   Feats.  These represent the biggest single modification to the original.  The idea may have come from the very similar and popular perks system in the Fallout series.  Like perks, feats are a tempting dessert tray of advantages that are wheeled out every few levels, and from which you can only choose one (or, very occasionally, two) for a given character at a time.  Some feats involve increasing save rolls for Will, Reflexes, Fortitude or Magical Resistance.  There are also feats that work from the opposite point of view, increasing a character's chances of over-riding saves.  IWD2 incorporates a number of opportunities to see its feats work in spectacular fashion.  I had to laugh out loud when my extremely agile Rogue was repeatedly attacked by a powerful tempest spirit in the Ice Temple, only to have every single one of those storm attacks fail due to his extraordinary feat-inspired reflexes.     Some feats are applied automatically: Sub-vocal Casting lets a character continue using spells after they've been silenced.  (This presumably involves training at the Marcel Marceau School for Spellcasters.)  Others feats are used only when players activate them, such as Expertise, which lets a character take a penalty of as much as 5 on attacks and apply it directly to Armor Classgreat for stalling monsters with your rogue, while your melee specialists whittle down the opposition.  A few feats use other feats, skills and/or attributes as prerequisites, which encourages careful planning.  For instance, Envenom Weapon requires at least one level in the Rogue profession and an Alchemy rating of 8 or higher.  The latter depends upon possessing a few levels as a Bard, Wizard, or Sorcerer.   Only one profession, the Fighter, has the chance to really grab a large number of feats.  (Fighters gain a bonus feat at the first level, and additional feats at every even-numbered level.)  The rest of your party will be left making careful choices that determine what sort of role each plays during combat, conversation, or just drudging across the endless miles of white tundra.  All this obviously tends to create a greater range of career-specific characters in any given game.   Magic-users familiar with 3E, take note: there are no meta-feats in IWD2.  These are a sub-set of feats that enable characters to (for example) stick a higher level version of the 3rd level Fireball spell in a 5th level spell slot, with correspondingly greater damage.  There's more to it than that, but meta-feats are honestly one area of the 3E rules where I'm not pleased with the results.  Too much about them smells of openly aired and coldly calculated game mechanics.  I frankly prefer BIS' other magical feats, which increase the strength of magical effects and decrease likely spell resistance while remaining resolutely within the playing world's frame-of-reference.  Thus, instead of moving a lower level fire attack spell into a higher level slot, your Wizard in IWD2 is offered the chance to learn Spirit of Flame, a feat that provides a tiny amount of fire resistance and a significant boost to all fire damage.   Skills.  Where feats are one-shot advantages, you develop skills by allocating points to them repeatedly as characters level.  Several skills, such as Hide, Pick Pocket, Search, Open Lock, Disable Device and Move Silently, will be familiar to players of roguery from other RPGs, though these skills are now available to all characters.  The Alchemy skill raises hopes that are soon dashed, since it doesn't grant a character the ability to make potions with ingredients: it simply lets a character recognize the nature of different unknown potions they encounter.  Use Magic Device lets Bards and Rogues wield magical items such as wands; but I found that a 12th level Rogue couldn't even make a Magic Missile Wand work.  Wilderness Lore is disappointing in implementation.  Rather than a repeated analysis of your party's surroundings as you move through an area, it just supplies a paragraph for the entire loaded area describing what creatures are around, and the clues that lead to your conclusions.  Bah.   Pickpocketing is still a mess, something it has been since BG1 first saw light of day.  This particular skill continues to equate lifting a few coins with stealing gems or valuable magical rings, and relies upon success or abject failure that instantly turns a potential victim into your most relentless enemy.  It's the kind of over-simplified gaming sub-system that has players constantly reloading, which in itself indicates something is wrong.  Why couldn't pickpocketed merchants just scream a bit and raise their prices, or throw you out for a week, or call the local constabulary and hand you a fine?   I did like the introduction of social abilities like Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate.  As these are applied automatically in conversation with NPCs, however, they're useful but dull.  Which is true in general about 3E skills: they're important for some characters to have, but the choices lack the distinction and excitement associated with Feats.  Fortunately, IWD2 makes their choice pretty much a no-brainer.  As long as you give any thieving or spellcasting character at least an average intelligence score, you'll never lack for skill points to allocate properly, and the choices themselves are pretty obvious.    Multi-classing.  Old style dual-classing and multi-classing are gone.  Now when a character makes a level, they apply that advancement to any available profession.  That means a 1st level Druid can apply their next level to being a Fighter.  They instantly gain all the abilities of a 1st level Fighter, while keeping those of the druid; and next time they make a level, you can return them to druidism just a bit sharper and more athletically inclined.  There's great flexibility in this system, at least when compared to the rigid AD&D 2nd edition rules.  I can just imagine an advertisement for the new multi-classing system inside an AD&D CRPG universe:   Is your Wizard looking a little unhealthy, with that sallow skin coloration that comes from lack of physical exercise?  Give him a level or two as a Fighter, buff up his weapon feats, and watch that cauldron belly vanish!  Is your Druid's winter wolf form guilty of unsightly molt in battle?  Give her a level of training as a Barbarian, and watch her wolf tear each of those yetis a new ice hole after summoning forth her Rage!  Hey, and don't forget our twofer offer!  Provide your Rogue with a level as a Ranger, and they'll automatically acquire the Ambidexterity and Two-Weapon Fight feats, allowing them to wield two, yes, TWO short swords or daggers with hardly any loss to hit at all in light armor!  FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!   Note that there are experience penalties for most races when they multi-class two or more professions more than one level apart.  There are a couple of important exceptions to this, though.  First, some races possess a ~favored profession.~  If that profession is one of two being multi-classed, no problems arise.  Also, humans avoid any hit to experience regardless of their multi-class configuration.  This ties in with the old AD&D mindset of the human race as possessing very quick learning skills to compensate for a lack of special race-related benefits.  Clearly, multi-classing just became a much more strategic and fun part of computer gaming.    New Classes, Kits, Adjusted Classes, Sub-Races.  Sorcerers are in; no great news there, since Baldur's Gate II offered them, as well.  (Unfortunately, Wild Mages, added in the BG2 expansion pack, Throne of Bhaal, are not.)  Monks are in, too, and the good news there is that they automatically receive a range of interesting special defenses and feat attacks as they gain experience.  If the former (like Diamond Body, which confers immunity to poison) keep your character from harm in battle, it's the latter that should prove the most fun, adding a strategic dimension to the profession not unlike spells.  ~Let's see: do I want Friar Tuck to use a Stunning Blow, or a Ki Strikeor maybe Quivering Palm against that drider warrior?~ will definitely be a refrain heard before many computer monitors at 2 AM in the next few months.   IWD2's Bards have finally achieved a degree of usefulness.  (If you're a dedicated fan of CRPG bards, consider my having written ~extra degree,~ instead.  Anything for a friend.)  These rather bland ~jacks of all trades, masters of none~ now learn and cast spells like Sorcerers rather than Wizards, which gives them a much smaller range of spells but far greater flexibility in their deployment.  (Sorcerers, remember, don't memorize specific spells.  Instead, they get a certain number of casts per level, and can apply those to any of the spells on that level which they've learned in the past.)  Regrettably, Magic Missile, that most useful of spells, has been removed from their repertoire, but they've kept Chromatic Orb.  They also gain several powerful Healing spells.  Bards can also take an optional feat called Lingering Song, which lets their dulcet melodies hang in the air for two additional rounds while they concentrate on something else.  This should prove a real boon to players who have kept bards along simply for their battle enhancing symphonies, and wished the little tunesmiths could do something other than simply play zithers and look quaint.   Fans of Rogues might be displeased at the absence of the old kits from BG2.  IWD2 offers you a single, vanilla Rogue.  However, they can take some of the most interesting feats, like Hamstring (which lets the character sacrifice a dice-rolled amount of sneak attack damage to reduce a target's movement to half speed for ten rounds).  By contrast, Rangers have very little going for them.  They receive no animal companions, and their feats are easily gained by having any party member take a single Ranger level.  Alas, this class has certainly seen better days.  Right, Boo?   Additional interest centers around the various sub-classes and sub-races that BIS has provided.  Clerics in particular are beneficiaries of this, with nine available sub-classes tied to various gods.  Each provides their worshipper with two powers and access to special domain spells.  These spells come in addition to the usual clerical ones for any given level.  So, for example, a newbie cleric of Tempus automatically receives the Martial Arts: Axe and Weapon Focus: Axe feats free, along with two spells: Magic Stone, and Bless.  Sure, all Clerics have these spells anyway, but the point is that a Tempus cleric gets a free extra copy of either at any time to cast.  Having an extra copy of something like Resurrection can be a major benefit later in the game, when a Cleric acquires really powerful domain spells.  And in some cases, clerics gain access by domain to spells outside their profession.  For example, Oghma Clerics can cast Malison, a Wizard/Sorcerer spell, when they get access to fourth level clerical spells.  Gotta love that.   Many races now come in multiple flavors.  Even humans have options such as Aasimar (some celestial blood in the mix) and Tiefling (a demon paid a social call on your mother) in addition to the generic brand.  Each sub-race supplies advantages and, if powerful enough, disadvantages as well.  The most potent of these penalizes a character by one or two levels in advancement, and remains constant throughout the game.  So a 10th level party with all members created at the same time will have the equivalent of an 8th level Dark Elven Bard, to prevent unbalance in gameplay.  That bard (we'll call him Sweetcakes) will always remain just a bit weaker in terms of experience to compensate for his fine array of extra attribute points (+2 to Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma) and abilities (+2 to all Will saves, Faerie Fire spell three times a day, etc).  Sure, the loss of experience is quite a hit, but that's what tradeoffs are all about.  And like anything else in worlds software-built or otherwise, success is a matter deploying effective strategies.     One final, interesting side effect of the new 3E system in IWD2: characters created at the same time gain levels about the same time, too.  This means that when you finish a major quest, it's Christmas all around, and everybody gets to advance.  You can almost hear the flasks of liquor being tossed back simultaneously around the old fireside as the party celebrates.  I rather like that.    IWD2's New Stuff, Part the Second: The Visuals   Don't expect differences on the main screen.  The same visual limitations apply here as in earlier BIS and Bioware CRPGs using this engine.  Character color choices still appear muted, and battles with a large number of foes can leave you fumbling for some aspirin and a magnifying glass to make bleary-eyed sense of it all.  (Which is not meant as a wholesale endorsement of 3D.  Those games come with their own share of benefits and problems.)  The animations are crude by today's standards, though the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form.  The Ice Temple, Black Raven Monastery and Severed Hand are especially memorable (with nice light sourcing in the last).  True, the outdoor artwork may look a lot like IWD1 in places, but that's the problem with snow-engulfed mountains: how many distinctively original 2D images can you create of them in the detail supported by an 800 x 600 resolution?  (It's called Icewind Dale for a reason, after all.  Duh.)     At least it is in 800 x 600.  (Higher resolutions are unsupported but available.)  IWD1 was issued in 640 x 480; and while the Heart of Winter expansion pack added the 800 x 600 resolution, the original interface was left unchanged.  BIS has taken advantage of the resolution upgrade to make major changes to the interface in IWD2, using smaller buttons and designing a new inventory/informational system that displays more.     Character toolbars are now customizable.  That's a good thing, too.  Under 3E, you can create characters with all class combinations of feats, skills, spells and items.  It made sense to allow you to rearrange and include whatever buttons are needed for just that particular character you've designed.  The system is simple to use: right-click on a toolbar button, and you'll see a list of possible buttons to put in its place.  Hovering the mouse over a button brings up a legend stating its purpose.  Left-click to select a replacement button, and you're finished.  There are twelve slots for buttons on each character's toolbar, and only one, the Guard button, that isn't customizable.  Want a Wizard with six buttons keyed to quick-cast certain spells?  No problem.   And remember how annoying it was in IWD1 to switch out that nifty magical shield every time you moved from a one-handed to a two-handed weapon, and then back again?  IWD2 let's you create four ~quick weapon~ slots of weapons and shields.  If you're in battle and want to switch from, say, sword-and-shield to crossbow, all you have to do is right-click on the current weapon/shield icons.  That will bring up your four quick weapon slots you've created for that character; then left-click on the slot you want to make active.  My only grumble is that when you've got one shield and two or more one-handed weapons, the shield stays in one quick slot.  There's no option to have it automatically swap itself into the next quick slot when you need it (and I didn't encounter many magical shields in my single play-through).  But it's a minor quibble.   The inventory screen has been redone as well.  Paper dolls that display items worn on characters are gone, replaced by a slightly animated image of your character as it appears on the main screen, as though seen through a scrying glass.  Around the edges of this image are spots for placing icon-sized items you want that character to wear and wield.  Artistically it's attractive, but personally the new look is a wash for me, neither better nor worse than the old.  If the animated image of a given character had been more individualized I'd feel more positive about the changes, but you only get the same tiny, barely distinguishable action figure in the inventory window as you do on the main screen.  The twenty-four inventory slots are a nice addition, though, since IWD only supported sixteen.    IWD2's New Stuff, Part the Third: Everything Else   Point buy, anyone?  You now receive a group of points to distribute among the usual six AD&D attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) during the character creation process, instead of taking a chance on dice rolls for each of the attributes, as was the game in other Infinity engine games.  There's been some controversy in the CRPG community over this change, which I'll frankly admit is difficult for me to understand.  Most of us will probably agree that we don't settle for poor dice rolls at this point, and reload more than a dozen times until we like the results.  In fact, the developers in the original IWD were so aware of this that they created a re-roll button at the bottom of the attributes generation screen, and then added the ability to raise and lower attribute numbers for a roll you liked.  That would seem to be a tacit admission that no one used the dice-roll system of character creation in computer RPGs the way it was intended, as a quick one-shot method of getting satisfactory results that launched you right into the game.  Point buy gives you a character whose attributes are fixed according to race, and a group of points to distribute in the mix.  As before, you can raise and lower attributes in the result to favor certain qualities.  I wouldn't want to create characters this way in a pen and paper RPG session where you can interact with a DM to heavily personalize a persona, but in a computer game like IWD2 it works well.   Since you've got complete control of your party's actions, there's no need to worry about their AI - as there was with Neverwinter Nights, and its braindead henchmen whose combat activities were subject to only generalized controls.  Yes, party AI is initially turned on, but only an insane player would use BIS' AI scripts to let party members make their own decisions in battle.  (Of course, we all know at least one player like that.  There is a fine line between madness and genius, and every now and then you come across somebody who's dedicated their life to scuffing out that line.)   Enemy AI is actually more challenging than in previous BIS and Bioware games.  Barbarian foes in battle regularly chug healing potions and ability extenders, while orc shamans run off to get support in the back lines.  (The shamans don't simply vanish while more troops appear.  I actually followed a couple back as they ran long distances, gathering fresh soldiers for a renewed attack.)  Enemy spellcasters look at the obvious spells that a party has up before deciding what to cast.  The spell choices they made were entirely reasonable; I've seen mage foes cast different spells in the same situations depending upon perceived threats, ally needs, and tide of battle.  In IWD, you could pretty confidently expect a given enemy to act the same way if you reloaded a saved game and came at it for a rematch.  Enemy AI still isn't as sneaky as human intelligence, but it's a lot more diabolical now, and apt to give veteran CRPGers a run for their gold pieces.    Conversely, pathing AI is the worst I've seen in this group of BIS/Bioware games since the original release of Baldur's Gate.  I've clicked too many times in IWD2 to send my party a modest distance, only to find that its last two members had chosen the scenic route and were now circling one-third of the way around in the other direction.  And this, mind you, was at the maximum setting of 400,000 path search nodes, in an area that allowed party members to walk three abreast.  There's little in life more frustrating than discovering that your Wizard has come across a lair of frost spiders to the north while everybody else in your group has been walking due east.   So How Does It Play?   Pretty damn well.  Since it's relentlessly linear (barring a few odd FedX quests, and a couple of minor choices that make some battles more or less difficult), the plot is relegated to a chain of ubiquitous ~defeat these monsters, kill their bosses, move onto the next~ scenarios.  Still, the ingenuity with which BIS approaches this task far exceeds the kind of bare-bones treatment you'll find in such action titles as the Diablo series, which provides effective non-stop action and nothing else.  There are no areas filled with all-purpose rooms in IWD2, while puzzles figure prominently in several locations during the game.  I particularly enjoyed the adjustable lightning bolt generator in the Ice Temple, which can open doors, fry enemies, and wreck merry havoc with your party as it shoots damage through the icy corridors via a host of mirrors.  The Fell Woods held its charms for an old Zork enthusiast, and the challenge of the Elder Brain and its associates in the Z'hinda Citadel maze furnished a refreshing change of pace.   These puzzles and adversaries provide a clue to IWD2's greatest success: its alterations in tempo.  The game isn't simply a series of heavily orchestrated battles, as was the original IWD's justly criticized add-on, Heart of Winter.  There are variations among many kinds of enemies, between skirmishes and major conflicts, and in strategies employed throughout open terrain, hollowed-out tunnels and elaborate, sophisticated structures.  Conversation, too, is important.  The choice of race, profession and charisma level in your party leader actually has a significant impact upon some quests and a number of rewards.  (For example, don't make a paladin or monk your party spokesperson in Targos.  The local leaders are feeling the pinch, and they'll gladly appeal to your sense of idealism instead of offering a previously agreed-upon reward.  Options to push for your deserved pay won't even be available.)   The flavorful dialog and sometimes mordantly humorous send-up of the genre (with its small chat among minor enemies before you arrive on the scenes, a villainous mage who stops to wonder when you cease to attack and chat, and its scoffing references to the victors of the original IWD) also make excellent reading.  Voice acting and music, two increasingly important elements in CRPGs, are both good.  However, it is a little disconcerting to hear Jack Roth perform the role of the air balloon-flying gnome, Oswald Fiddlebender (who makes a return trip from IWD), since he also played the major character Jan Jansen in BG2.  The confusion only mounts when you discover you can choose a voice set for your characters that usesJack Roth.  Much as I like Roth's distinctive vocal quality and acting ability, BIS really should think about investing a bit in more diversified talent.  I was very disappointed with Neverwinter Nights.  Its 3D graphics didn't thrill, even by 2D standards.  Its dialog and characters were pedestrian.  The AI for henchmen, animal companions and familiars, which you could only indirectly control, was pitiful.  The search for random minor treasure in endless barrels and chests got tiring after the first fifteen minutes.  I know the singleplayer game was only intended to show off the capabilities of the system, but as a spokesperson for possibilities it stuttered badly. By comparison, IWD2 feels like a return to old, positive virtues.  The direct control it furnishes over the actions of your six party members makes for more strategic options in combat than NWN, and a corresponding sense of achievement when you succeed.  The pace of IWD2 is more varied, its balance better, the gameplay more interesting.  I could praise the results as a victory for 3E, since the bulk of the game's improvements fall under its sway, but it's actually the implementation of the new rules that deserves praise.  BIS has done a fine job in general of class and race tweaking.  Nor should we forget the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make you wonder why they weren't thought of before.IWD2 isn't the kind of CRPG like BG2 or Morrowind that will send you into an epiphany over its atmosphere and imagination, but it provides strong value and consistent entertainment.  It lures you from one challenge to the next, and just when you think ah ha, I've finished the game, a quietly compelling little voice asks whether you might have even more fun restarting the thing with a completely different party.  That's the hallmark of a very good CRPG.", "date": "Sep 5, 2002"}
