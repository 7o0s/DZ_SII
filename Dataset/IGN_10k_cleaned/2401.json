With a less than satisfactory entree into the first-person shooter genre with its flagship title, Soldier of Fortune: Gold, the company that works closely with Raven and Activision is now ready with Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force.   Another port from the PC, Voyager is very much a less-than-satisfactory first-person shooter, and as a general PlayStation 2 game, it's neither good looking nor does it present gamers with a first-person shooter experience that is new or different. In general, I wouldn't buy this.   But the folks at PipeDream Interactive have gone about Voyager with a slightly more appealing presentation -- cut-scenes, menus and movies -- than SOF: Gold. Underlying everything there's a playful sense of humor that makes interacting with the non-player characters charming. The player gets to the chance to enjoy hanging out with other Star Trek crewmembers, and however goofy that might be to some, it's probably a thrill for others. I definitely felt that the various missions, some entirely frag-free, made for a nice chance of pace.    In short, Voyager is occasionally fun amidst a plethora or ordinary gameplay elements, mediocre graphics, and some pretty dopey but poignant Star Trek-esque plot lines and scenarios. It can best be summed up as a true diehard fan game, designed only for those who simply can't get enough Star Trek no matter how hard they try. For the rest of us it's just another game to skim past on the retail shelf.    Gameplay The story starts out with the U.S.S. Voyager crew responding to an urgent signal distress, and unwittingly becoming sucked into and trapped by the said craft in an unchartered dimension filled with old, dead ships. The crew's ship is damaged, and an unknown source is slowly draining away the ship's energy, while small crews of mixed pirates begin pilfering its resources and supplies. You are Ensign Munro, part of the Elite Force, a small force of active fighters who must discern where the ship is, how to repair it, and to inevitably confront the malevolent force that started this whole thing in the first place.   The game commences with a scenario that appears to be a real set of fights, but ends up being a test run. And it's one that you consciously are made to fail. Kind of an interesting approach to a game, but one that I like because it made me feel that I had room to improve and things to learn. Naturally, everyone is meant to feel this, but it's a cool idea, and it works. As soon as you're thoroughly reprimanded for not following orders, the opening credits roll, and the average-looking CG runs across the screen and makes you feel like you're watching the TV show Star Trek Voyager. Neat.   What's nice about this game is its slight sense of character. The folks at Majesco probably had to conform to strict guidelines while using the Star Trek TV characters, and yet at the same time they managed to get a feeling for the Star Trek universe, with various personalities and intra-crew chatter without feeling canned or forced.   The crew includes senior staff Captain Janeway, Commander Chakotay, Lt. Commander Tuvok, Lt. Torres, Ensign Paris, Ensign Kim, the Doctor, Seven of Nine, and Nelix. The Alpha Squad features lt. Foster, Ensign Munro, Crewman Chang, Crewman Biessman, Crewman Murphy, Crewman Chell, and Crewman Jurot. The Beta Squad comprises Crewman Oviedo, Crewman Lathrop, Crewman Odell, Crewman Csatlos, Crewman Jaworski, Crewman Nelson, and Crewman Laird.   What's nice about this first-person shooter is that while the game itself moves and feels like the awkward, annoying, and jumpy frame-rate Soldier of Fortune: Gold, Voyager takes a different tact. It's more about the Star Trek experience, so the levels aren't strictly based on fighting. They are interspersed with physical puzzles and jumping sequences, and some basic logistical quests. These enable players to interact with the non-player characters, who occasionally have funny things to say. This is more of a diversion from the blasting core of the game, and it's out of sheer boredom that most of these things are funny, but still, the game offers a subtle sense of humor that can be found in its little nooks and crannies.   For instance, in one scenario, a ~stealth~ level, you have to secretly sneak past all sorts of guards, who are asleep on the job. They are sitting down and snoring. It's silly, but cute. The Stealth part is actually quite ridiculous because they inevitably almost always wake up, and then your commander yells at you about ~supposed to be stealthy!~ Another funny little scenario had an exploratory ship leaving the Voyager, and the computer announcer saying that the onboard movie would be, ~Captain Proton and the RoboZombies.~ Again, cute.   As for the whole feel to the game, Majesco's development team did get a good feel for the Star Trek experience. You have to navigate the hallways, walking through all sorts of Star Trek rooms and turbo lifts, and you get to experience the buzzing and beeping of Star Trek ship itself. Then there is the adventure with an alien race called the Etherians. The whole Etherian set of levels is classic Star Trek. You enter into their lair, explore a weird bio-technical set of caverns, and then finally when you reach the power core, you learn that the enemy Etherians captured your men because they needed to analyze to learn how to speak English. Why? Because, in fact, they're not the enemy at all. They didn't know how to tell you that because they don't talk in the same way as humans. In fact, they are friendly, and want to help your cause. Ahhh... a classic case of miscommunication, a simple error in inter-species language barriers. Very logical, indeed.   Still, despite its cuteness and Star Trek vibe, as a basic first-person shooter this game is below average in every category. The control is stilted, difficult, and inaccurate. Much of this is caused by the choppy, sub-30 framerate, which hinders the action, and just the basic set of controls itself. The collision detection isn't quite as bad as it was it Soldier of Fortune, or perhaps that's just my imagination talking, and the ability to target a simple enemy is rough going.   Aside from the funny little task objectives, the gameplay is standard stuff: find this key, unlock this door, blast these enemies, shoot that guy using this specific weapon, etc., etc. It's worth mentioning that the weapons are Star Trek-ish, and some of them are quite good looking, even though the game itself is really basic in look and design. The one weapon that really caught my attention was the Etherian gun, a bio-weapon that looks like a small, hand-held Manta Ray in green and blue.   Aside from the lousy control, and the average levels, and the uninteresting four-player mode, Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force is really a sub-par game that Star Trek fanatics might like, if they're desperate enough.   Graphics There are two kinds of gamers, visually: the graphic tarts, and everyone else. Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force is not a game you want to look at if you're in the first category. For everyone else, it's a rough looking game that presents a bucketload of repeating textures and average looking rooms, hallway, and arenas. For those who want to show off their killer new PS2 with a hot set of games, this is not one to use.   And as I have said, the framerate hits 30 FPS once in a while, but it's inconsistency makes for a choppy, awkward looking game. When it comes to the characters, you will certainly be able to recognize the ones you like or dislike from the show, but in general the characters are incredibly bland looking, with very average looks and features. Also, what's not so good looking is the way the characters' lips synch up with the words coming from their mouths. The facial animations are rough, very rough...   Having said all this, I was surprised to see that several of the levels did in fact vary drastically. In each new area, whether it's on board the U.S.S. Voyager, or on another planet or ship, the art staff tried to create a technically interesting set of ship interiors, with some success. I don't know why, but I guess I keep coming back to the Etherians levels, wherein their lairs were the most interesting looking. Overall, the gameplay is better than the graphics in this game, but both are far below what we have come to expect from a PS2 game.   Sound The best audio thing about this game is that the voices from all of the characters, except one, are acted by the real actors in the TV show. The only one whose voice isn't in this game is Jeri Ryan, who plays Seven of Nine. Still, because of the accurate voice acting, the audio portion of the game is great. As for the sound, if you like lots of technical beeping, buzzing, electronic doors swishing open with little whizzing sounds, you'll like this game (though that's not much to latch onto...).Majesco has taken a good game that finally got the Star Trek license right, and made a bad port, simple as that. The level design of the game is decent, the atmosphere is great, the characters have character, but the control is lousy, the framerate is lousy, and the game looks like a bad port, with average graphics and an abundance of repeating textures. If you like Star Trek, you may indeed like this game, despite the major transition problems it has. And if that's the case, at least in terms of atmosphere and good Star Trek presentation, you may indeed like Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force.", "date": "Dec 20, 2001"}
