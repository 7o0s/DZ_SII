{"name": "Spawn: Armageddon", "name_review": "Spawn Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/22/spawn-review", "text": "It's hard to believe that Spawn is already more than a decade old, and even more difficult to accept that there has yet to be a decent videogame based off of him. Already subject to several iterations in the 16 and 32-bit eras, the world's most depressed hell general is still waiting to be exploited to his full potential. As up until now, no one has managed to unlock the correct combination of action and atmosphere to appropriately nail the character; we've always been given tired side-scrolling beat 'em ups and claustrophobic Fighting Force clones instead.   But with Namco's latest attempt at the anti-hero known as Spawn: Armageddon, things could definitely be looking up. Developed by Scorpion King scribes Point of View, the new cross-platform actioner doesn't break new ground; but its obvious homage to Capcom's Devil May Cry ends up taking it a lot further than its predecessors. Flawed as it may be, Armageddon still manages to provide a precedent we hadn't yet seen. Because for the first time in history, the world has been blessed with a Spawn title that can actually be fun.   Gameplay  Spawn is as close to borrowing concepts from Devil May Cry that you can get without having to worry about copyright issues. The real trade-off here is that DMC has a much greater emphasis on juggling opponents and solving puzzles, where the focus in Spawn is item collection and platforming. Despite these key differences, however, both game's main goals are essentially the same: kill whatever it is that gets in your way and move on to the next level to do it again. Not surprisingly Armageddon's mechanics, control scheme, and upgrade system match Capcom's effort almost perfectly. Which is both a blessing and a curse all at once (kind of like Spawn himself).   To its benefit, Spawn provides four to six hours of mindless slashing and blasting action across three difficulty settings (all three need to be beaten to achieve 100% completion ranking). From the New York bowery to the gates of Heaven itself, your alter ego will be assaulted by numerous Imps, whip demons, robotic monstrosities, angelic warriors, and other such creatures for more than 20 consecutive levels and even take part in traditional boss-monster confrontations. The Violator, Cy-Gor, The Redeemer, and a handful of other familiar faces definitely provide some of the most entertaining moments of the game.    To battle these hordes, Spawn has been given a huge number of weapons and powers to assist him. The Axe is his standard attack used for lumbering and oversized opponents while the popular living chains can be thrown at opponents for long distance battering of speedy or airborne assailants. Mr. Simmons can also take charge of seven different projectile weapons like the shotgun and missile launcher and even make use of magic that enhances his abilities or creates protective shields. Less offensive talents like the cape glide and chain grapple come in handy too, especially during the platform-heavy building jumps and leap of faith-like chasms found in the latter stages.    As an added benefit, the Devil May Cry-inspired upgrade system allows players to supply their Spawn with more powerful versions of their favorite weapon; and also permits them to increase Spawn's overall physical ability in terms of magic and health. In the normal and hard settings, these upgrades are very important -- as the sheer number of enemies you'll encounter can reach as many as ten opponents at once. It definitely has its moments where things can get pretty hectic and pretty fun, especially during the aforementioned boss battles. Once you take into account the hidden collectibles and unlockable content that can be found by more astute players, you have yourself the making of a very playable and accessible piece of software; but then the problems start.   To begin with, the normal and hard difficulty settings don't provide much of a challenge at all. As despite the fact that you can get overwhelmed by enemies in a multitude of areas, their A.I. borders on stupid. With their low health bars and non-aggressive patterns, it shouldn't be a problem for moderate or experienced gamers to walk all over the opposition; and if you're upgraded even a little bit you have that much more of an advantage.   Another problem lies with Spawn's limited combo system. Much like Dynasty Warriors and Manhunt, Armageddon tries to keep things simple so that it can make use of your character's other abilities. But unlike those two titles, Namco's game allows you to get by with the same two attacks for the majority of the game. With the exception of a few (usually armored) enemies, almost anything and everything can be taken out by repeated chain strikes or basic three-point axe swing. It's still fun, yes, but it exposes the weapon and magic systems for what they really are: alternative but unnecessary means of combat. In truth, repetition may become Spawn's biggest adversary.    Other small gripes, like the occasionally confusing platforming paths (i.e.: the Hell stage) and repeated camera issues make Spawn a little clunkier than we'd like. There are also a couple of areas that simply serve as nothing but nonsensical transition rooms; with no enemies to fight or items to collect as you walk through them. Why make players boringly traverse an alleyway for 20 seconds only to put them in another one immediately afterwards. It's just plain weird.    The strangest occurrence of them all, however, is that the GameCube version of Armageddon is annoyingly buggy. Our boxed retail copy crashed several times for no reason at all and would retire to a black screen of death as it repeated the last sound effect on the screen over and over again. We experienced this on several different GameCubes in several different levels without a single scratch or blemish on the disc. Luckily, this only happened with the Cube version of the game and the Xbox and PS2 iterations ran just fine.   Graphics  Todd McFarlane's comic book has always been known for its high level of illustrational detail and Point of View has done a solid job of recreating that. Whether it's Spawn, The Violator, or one of Jason Wynn's lowly soldiers, each and every character appears just as they do in the funny papers. And though the stages aren't designed as well as they are in the similarly built Devil May Cry, the art design is still pretty cool.   To break up any possible monotony between the stages, Armageddon has over 30 different environments and includes the alleyways of New York, a military training facility, Central Park, and the bowels of Hell itself. And because the design of the game is so straightforward, players will rarely have to retread the same ground twice. As an added plus, widescreen television proprietors should be happy to know that Spawn: Armageddon also boasts 16:9 support across all versions and even progressive scan abilities for PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube owners. Though the quality of full-motion video is top notch regardless of which edition you may happen to own.    Sadly, Spawn is plagued with camera issues in several different areas. In closely-knit areas like the alley ways, for instance, the camera will frequently catch behind obstacles without transparencies; making it difficult to see what's going on. Luckily the view can be adjusted with the right analog stick to compensate, but it doesn't always respond the way it's supposed too; allowing the enemy plenty of free hits while you maneuver yourself into position to fix it. Fellow GameCube and PS2 owners should also take note that there's a great deal of tearing and seeming that goes on as well, while all three versions of the game has slowdown every couple of rooms.   Sound  Spawn sounds great with its Dolby Pro Logic II (GCN, PS2) and Dolby Digital (Xbox) surround sound encoding and has nicely acted voice-overs that bear a striking resemblance to those from the HBO television series. Because the story is so thin, however, you shouldn't expect to hear them every often. But take comfort in knowing that when you do, the vocalists have made them count.   As for the soundtrack, it's almost entirely metal with a powerful array of searing guitar riffs and monstrous drum beats that highlight the bloody action pretty effectively. Though, the Marilyn Manson tune called ~Use Your Fist and Not Your Mouth~ is the obvious highlight and definitely works as the game's violently hellish spiritualistic anthem. Truthfully, the only real complaint we have in the audio department is the repetition of the unvaried sound effects (squish noises, explosions, and bullet zips are about all there is) and the obvious pauses during the reloading of musical pieces. Otherwise, it's all good.  Best described as a solid rental for action fans and an ideal purchase for Spawn followers, Armageddon isn't that bad at all; but it still could have been better: challenged by a few technical issues (especially on the GameCube) and held back because of its repetition, it might not grab as many audiences as Namco hopes -- Even if it is mindless, good-looking fun.That said, Spawn: Armageddon definitely has potential. With a couple of mechanical refinements, better power balancing, and an improvement to enemy A.I., a sequel could certainly turn some heads. Here's to hoping.", "date": "Nov 22, 2003"}
