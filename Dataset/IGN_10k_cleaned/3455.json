Folks might not realize that, before Nintendo entered the videogame market more than two decades ago, it was a successful card game manufacturer. And Mario Party-e brings the company back to its origins, all the while keeping its feet firmly in the videogame world. Mario Party-e is a clever little game for friends to whip out and play together, and also shows off another angle of what the versatile e-Reader peripheral can do. Mario Party-e is a card game for two to four players. The box comes packaged with everything players need to get started: a deck of 64 cards, a foldable glossy paper game board, and a set of instructions and rules. Mario Party-e is not an ~expandable~ card game like Magic: the Gathering, Pokemon: Trading Card Game, or Yu-Gi-Oh; rather it's a set game like Uno or Mille Bornes.  The deck in Mario Party-e consists of 24 Coin cards, 12 Item cards, four Superstar cards, five Blocker cards, four Search cards, 10 Chaos cards, and five Duel cards. In the game, players start off with five cards apiece, and take turns drawing a card from the deck as well as playing a card from their hands. Coins are the ~currency~ of the game, which can be used to ~purchase~ challenges, items, or blockers from the players' hands. To win the game, players must have the three different Item cards in play and discard the final Superstar card. Specific cards have specific actions, and can easily turn the tide on the game. Some cards can steal coins from opposing players (or remove them from play completely), or snag another player's item card, or force players to exchange hands with each other.  The Game Boy Advance and e-Reader comes into play in select e-Challenge cards. Four Search cards, two Chaos cards, and all five Duel cards are encoded with e-Reader strips that, when discarded during play, must be scanned into a GBA with e-Reader for players to take part in the specific card challenges. Four single player challenge cards are known as ~Free Challenge~ cards; if the player doesn't want (or can't) spend the amount of coins to put the card in play, he or she can play the e-Reader mini-game challenge to do so. Win the challenge, and the player can perform the task on the card. Lose, and the card gets put back in the deck. Single player games:  Cast Away Mario: Princess Peach calls out a specific fish, and the challenge is to time your button press so that the hand will ~grab~ the fish that she wants. Grab the right one and you win the challenge. Grab the wrong one and lose. Mario's Mallet: At the beginning of the challenge, a random number of goomas is selected; the challenge is to hammer that amount of Goombas before they reach the Princess. Accidentally whack Luigi, and you lose. Daisy's Rodeo: Quite possibly the most difficult challenge in Mario Party-e. It's a ~simple~ task of following the buttons that appear on the screen. Quickly press L, R, or B to keep Daisy on the bucking Bowser. Fast Feed Yoshi Easily the lamest game in the bunch: push the A button to have Yoshi lash out his tongue into a rotating ring of Shyguys and coins. Eat two coins to win the challenge. Lakitu's Luck It's a simple roulette wheel. Wherever the tumbler stops is what's awarded to the player. Spinister Bowser Same thing as Lakitu's Luck, but most of the results have a negative effect.     Players can also discard Duel cards which will challenge a player of the card holder's choosing; the victor of the e-Reader duel gets what's written on the card. Multiplayer Duels Bolt from Boo: Two players take turns running Mario from Boo towards the exit by hitting the A and B buttons. Since Boo is faster than Mario, players will have to stop and turn around to make the ghost stop and hide. If Boo catches Mario, the challenge is over for that player. The fastest time to the exit wins the challenge. Time Bomb Ticks: Player one must stop the clock by pressing buttons in order from 1 to 16. Whatever time is left on the clock is given to the second player, who must do the same thing as the clock counts down. If Player Two stops the clock, he wins. If the bomb goes off, Player One wins.  Waluigi's Reign: Players take turns running Mario in a shower of coins and hammers. When the timer runs out, it's Player Two's turn to collect more coins than Player One. Get hit by a hammer, and the turn is over.  Wario's Bluff: Race Wario's vehicle as close to the edge of the cliff as possible without flying off the edge. The closest to the edge of the cliff, without flying off, wins the challenge.  Balloon Burst: This is a rendition of Hot Potato. Each player takes turns holding the A button to inflate the balloon. When a player lets go, they hand the system to the second player, who inflates the balloon bigger. Whoever pops the balloon, loses the challenge.   These mini-games obviously can't stand on their own, with their basic graphics, sound, and gameplay presentation. But hey, these challenges are embedded as two tiny dot strips on the edges of playing cards. If anything, these mini-games really show off just how much the card strips can hold, and taken into that context, these mini-games are pretty darn impressive. Folks without an e-Reader peripheral can still play Mario Party-e, replacing the e-Reader challenges with a toss of the coin.  The actual card game has its ups and downs, but overall it's well designed. Some games can take less than five minutes for someone to win, while others will extend to nearly an hour of play. It all depends on the cut and shuffle of the cards just how long a game can last. While it might be begging to ask for more mini-games, it feels like the e-Reader angle isn't used nearly enough with the eleven different challenges. Perhaps Nintendo will make Mario Party-e booster decks to include more challenges that will involve more GBA play than what's currently offered...it would certainly be welcomed.   Though the mini-games aren't much to write home about, the entire Mario Party-e package is something perfect for those interested in seeing how Nintendo supports its e-Reader peripheral. The stand-alone card game is a decent diversion, though it's not going to be as classic as Uno or Mille Bornes...more fitting the obscure, like Parker Bros. Monopoly-branded ~Free Parking~ card game. But for less than ten bucks, the price is definitely right.", "date": "Feb 25, 2003"}
