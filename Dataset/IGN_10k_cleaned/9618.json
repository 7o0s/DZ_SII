Like two positively charged ions, the two seemed destined to always be fighting it out, with a collaboration about as likely as hell freezing over. How things have changed. Sadly, it wasn't worth the wait. Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is - frankly - quite awful. Patch and I basically spent an entire work day hanging out playing the game, and, man, I can't remember anything about that extended session being fun.   Patch: Well, putting in your username is fun. The game filters out obscene names, and apparently 'Felchor' falls into that category, as does 'Ballsuck' and 'Flange', but not 'Milf' or 'Funbags'. Hmmm. It's odd - this is effectively a party game that punishes you for playing with friends by depriving you the opportunity to unlock new games outside of the one-player game. That's just wrong! I mean, in theory, Mario and Sonic going head-to-head should be brilliant fun, but the Olympic theme actually limits the creativity. Who wants to use Bowser to long-jump? Who wants Dr. Eggman (Robotnik) to shoot skeets? What this game needed was to focus on creating events that capitalise on the different stages and worlds from both franchises, maybe tweaking these sports and making them a little more digestible.   Where's Donkey Kong? Not sure, but hey, Waluigi's here. Waaaa!  Cam/Funbags: Yeah, it's bizarre that the whole structure for unlocking stuff in this game is geared around single player - even though single and multiplayer are both accessed from the very same menu. Isn't the whole point of this game multiplayer? It's one of many old school design decisions that just doesn't make much sense in light of how people will actually want to play this game. In the end we spent more time in single player working our way through the different sets of events than we did in multiplayer, and let me just reiterate - the structure, whether you're playing on your own, or with four people, is exactly the same. Just let us unlock stuff in multiplayer already. It's especially weird because the poor sap that does go through and unlock everything will have a huge advantage because he or she will know how all the different sports work. Still, it's all a bit of a moot point anyway because Mario & Sonic completely fails to deliver in multiplayer. It is simply no fun at all.   Patch: The game's content is a strange blend of awkward movements that simulate running, different swimming strokes, jumping, landing, spinning and aiming. Some are logical - pump the controller in different directions, ala any other running-style mini-game you've played before, but you have to also factor in jumping, and in the case of Dream Races, you also have to steer left and right with the nunchuk, activate items with A and avoid sandtraps and other obstacles with B. It's almost too convoluted for the target casual gamer market, while not offering enough depth or interest for the hardcore gamer. Mario and Sonic are merely decoration in what is a very bland set of simulated sports events.   Games like rowing and trampolining require timed button presses and motions; these work a little better, since the simplicity is there. However, the accuracy and detection is definitely off-kilter. This is really noticeable in games like table tennis, where we swear we're nailing our timing but the character just doesn't connect with the ball. Lame.   Feints, parries and lunges, they're all here. It's still not fun. Waaaa!  Cam: Seriously man, I think that was part 'accuracy and detection' and part you sucking. Still, table tennis is pretty shocking. As for your comment about rowing and trambopolining (or is it tram-apolining?), the latter was the closest I came to actually having fun, as the controls worked and I wasn't playing one of the ten million games that required pumping my arms up and down (still, I guess it's good training for Rock Band). Disagree on the rowing though - the button combination thing was completely unintuitive. The whole point of this system is to get away from pressing buttons - to use naturalistic motions. And that could have worked a treat for rowing. The action itself is perfect for the Wiimote and Nunchuk, and rather than having to do it fastest, it could have been based on strong, powerful, well-timed strokes. Not having to press A + Z, then Z + B. What's that about?   There are just so many control missteps here. Why do we have to hold A while we twirl the Wiimote during the Hammer Throw, but press B to release it? Wouldn't releasing A - the button we're already holding down - make more sense? The ultimate example of convoluted controls for the sake of convoluted controls, however, has to be archery. You'd think this would be a natural fit, but no, you have to hit buttons, pull the string back, then align two disparate aiming devices. SEGA simply doesn't have Nintendo's grip on what usability is. Wii Sports shows how simple and straightforward it can be, while this game does just the opposite. If Nintendo had developed this I suspect it would be a far more intuitive and fun game.    Patch: On a more positive note, the graphics don't suck. The game is pretty sharp, if fairly basic by Mario Galaxy standards. There's some nice depth of field effects going on, but the animations really needed some retooling. Even Sonic's running animation is kind of underwhelming and there simply isn't enough lard-filled arse wiggle in Wario's derriere. The voice samples are baffling. When Mario exclaims 'I'lla get you next time', it has this strange, quiet menace about it, like he's going to corner me in a dark alley and shank me with a shiv.   Sadly, Waluigi isn't featured in this screenshot. And making it even worse, Shadow is featured. Waaaa!  So, let's review the tally so far. The gameplay is lacking in the fun department, the controls are either overcomplicated or hugely repetitive, and the presentation is a mixed bag. On the upshot, there are a few mini-games that unlock Olympic trivia - wait. Is that an upshot? I don't like the Olympics, so not really. But you might, so  ...maybe? The mini-games are really simplistic; just versions of whack-a-mole (with goombas replacing moles), versions of memory and counting games and a strange ball-sorting game. If you have a real penchant for inflicting pain on yourself, you can listen to the midi soundtrack too.   Cam: They are absolutely not upshots. Unless you're four, and want to watch Mario and Tails taking it in turns jumping in the air and shouting  'yahoo' and 'awesome' respectively. I really am shocked at how little fun there was to be found in this package. As an indication of how lacklustre this is as a 'party' game, we actually wound up enjoying taking turns in single player more than we did playing multiplayer. And not just because we were actually getting stuff done in the context of the game (although why the hell you're awarded trophies and not medals in an officially licensed Olympics game I have no goddamn idea), but also because a lot of the events aren't simultaneous, so it can take forever just to get through everyone's go. This would be such a trial with four people.   We'll go out on a high note with Luigi competing in one of the better events. This move is called 'skyward wang'. Waaaa!  One other mode we should mention is the Mission section of the game. As you play through the various Circuits (in single player only of course) you unlock a series of one-shot challenges for the characters you're using. Stuff like 'throw the javelin between 30 and 50 metres', 'come second in this race', or 'try to play an entire mini-game without swearing at the TV'. It's actually a really good idea, but again, it falls flat. Your final thoughts Mr Patch?   Patch: Best hold my tongue.Cam: Yep, it's time to take the game's own advice. Every half an hour, you see, a kiddie-friendly screen pops up with Toad sucking on a juice box and a sleepy looking Chao with the text ~it's time to take a break.~ Patronising? Yes. Good advice? You bet. Just make sure it's a permanent one.", "date": "Nov 22, 2007"}
