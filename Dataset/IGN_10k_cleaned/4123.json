Warcraft III, Medieval and Age Of Mythology very quickly come to mind as classics which have gone this way. Warrior Kings is also worth mentioning in this vein, although it is not quite in the same league.    This reworking of the first game in the Warrior Kings series isn't really a true sequel, as much of the original game's systems are still the same. However, developer Black Cactus have removed the annoying and cumbersome turn-based strategy component which didn't sit well with the original game, while adding new multiplayer modes and campaign elements as well as the battle with new Warrior King general characters.   The game is set in the mythical realm of Orbis and, like all mythical realms, this one is awash with turmoil and conflict. The basic geographic and political makeup of this world is inspired by Feudal Europe, but naturally there are fantasy and magical elements as well, hence the fantasy- inspired name. The fact that there are demons and magicians wandering about the place help set Orbis apart from the Europe we know from the annals of history as well.   The campaign is long and, for the most part, satisfying. You even get new skills and bonuses as you grab fresh territory from your enemies.  Once you are done with the 22 missions on offer, there is also the ever-popular skirmish option. You can build a base and take on random enemies in typical skirmish style or you can opt for the more Myth- inspired pure combat option where you are given a limited army and have to manage it well in the heat of battle often against superior opposition.   The interface isn't as straightforward as some games in the genre, as the mouse is context sensitive with double-clicks selecting whole groups for non-military units and single- clicks doing the same for resource gatherers. This can be confusing.     However, on the positive side of the ledger, your peasants use their initiative when you are building stuff and gathering resources as they work out what you want to do, and get on with the tasks automatically.    In these post-Warcraft III days, the animation and characters are nothing write home about. There is plenty of color and most units have an appearance which belies their intended function, but the units also have a generic feel about them and certainly the artists could have injected a little more pizzazz and personality into them.   All too often in 3D action strategy offerings, a discussion of the inadequacies of the camera system is necessary, and sadly this is also the case here. On the face of it, things seem pretty promising. You actually have a lot of control over the viewpoints you can choose and there aren't set camera angles.  Instead, you can smoothly zoom down to ground level or hang your viewpoint up in the heavens.    However, despite having so much variety in terms of the perspectives at your disposal, you will find that too much mucking about only gets in the way of good play. Instead, a default camera viewpoint a little more zoomed out than Warcraft III works just about fine. The trouble is that, from time to time, you will accidentally or intentionally change the viewpoint, and then it is a lot of fiddling about to get it just about right. Simple default presets would have helped here.    Also, the camera system, which lets you zoom out to ridiculous ranges, very quickly reveals a degree of slowdown on lesser PCs. But on my rig, a 2.8GHz unit, all was smooth and finely detailed. The camera viewpoint seems to provide you with the least useful view of the action when you get too close as well, so the ability to zoom up close is largely redundant   The 3D engine is for the most part a robust beast, although there is still slowdown when you encounter large numbers of units onscreen or big undulating sections of terrain. This is most marked when you scroll over hills.   As with many titles of this nature, there is a formation system. This lets you choose from four default options, and some are very useful depending on how good you are at marshalling your troops. Also, for some reason, your formations seem to lose cohesion in battle. Now, this makes sense in the real world where warriors lose their sense of order as the bloodlust reaches a crescendo (and they soil their pants trying to get away from the carnage in less brave cases). However, there is no point having a formation system if it doesn't work that reliably in battle. Well- drilled formations moving off to war are useless if your units break into seething masses when the fighting begins. Medieval suffered from this problem, but at least the men attempted to reform in their original battle order, sadly, this doesn't happen very well in Warrior Kings.   Units also behave strangely at times, and it feels like the guys from Black Cactus could have done a little more polishing in the artificial intelligence department. Pathing can be odd and some units seem to like standing there while their mates get massacred while others. Most notably, the siege engines all too often wander off and do their own thing. The cavalry are particularly good at losing the plot and have to be managed aggressively a lot of the time, lest they charge off with ideas of their own. These are the sorts of problems we have seen since Dune II and the inception of the genre, and it is a little odd that not enough has been done here with some unit types, while others seem to be very good at initiating the right sorts of self-motivated actions in combat.    It is good to note the rock-paper-scissors symmetry of the game design, though with different unit types all playing a role. Footsloggers, artillery, and missile units all have their uses and natural foils. Being able to pause the game, issue orders and then rejoin the conflict is something which many of you will appreciate, especially when you remember that managing your base back home can take up a lot of your time. Being able to stop things and re-prioritize is something which helps make the game a lot more manageable.   The economic and base-building system is quite involved and has been rather eloquently implemented. There are structures which have to be built inside the confines of your fortress walls and those which have to be built in the open countryside. The aim of this is to prevent turtling, I suppose, as your base invariably grows beyond the confines of your castle's protection. So a standing defensive force is essential. Your fort will grow gradually with success, but the key to winning is making sure the outlying buildings are adequately defended.   Magic plays a small but important role. You can cast spells or call for divine intervention from the Gods. Both of these approaches work well, and your access to different magical powers depends on which one of the three factions you have decided to choose (Renaissance, Pagans, or The Empire). You can kind of have it both ways a bit too, as you will be able to gain some skills which belong to each grouping, depending on the choices you make.   Some of the more over the top powers you can summon include mighty earthquakes or lightning. The effects aren't up there with Age Of Mythology, but they will still bring a grin to your face if you are causing massive damage to your enemies.   One of the most bizarre magical powers at your disposal revolves around you building a wicker man with sacrificial peasants as a part of the structure which you then destroy in order to summon the most malevolent unit in the game, Abadon, a demon with terrible power.  Warrior Kings: Battles is the sort of game fans of the genre (like your truly) will sink their teeth into, as there is plenty of depth. However, the game lacks that spark which sets the classics apart from the also-rans. That is not to say you will be disappointed if you buy this game, as it is worth it if you enjoy this sort of thing, just don't expect too much ~wow factor.~", "date": "Nov 5, 2003"}
