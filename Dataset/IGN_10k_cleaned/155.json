Do you see what playing a game like Sprint Cars 2 will do to a man's brain? It makes you think rhyming ~dora~ with ~bore-a~ is actually clever. As the fog of stupidity starts to fade, I realize that now. But that's what hours of turning left at minimal speed will do to a man. When a one-off tractor pull mini-game is the best part of your racing title, you know you're doing something wrong.    It's not that the various wingless sprint, sprint, pro stock, ~late model,~ rally and -- I kid you not -- police cars don't do what they're supposed to. It's just that what they do is monumentally boring. Racing games are generally about going fast and finishing before the rest of the pack, yet Sprint Cars 2 never seems to move beyond a snail's pace or make jostling for the lead compelling in any way.    Yeah right. There's a Career mode that goes a little beyond the usual progression tacked on to vanilla Arcade mode where you actually have to buy and manage cars, parts, drivers and sponsorships. But no matter how good the wrapper might look, if what's inside is bland and tasteless, it's not worth trying. And the actual racing, which really does consist of just turning left over and over again while trying to control powerslides and slipstream behind opponents, is most certainly bland. It looks like a circa 1998 effort. Little things like the car turning on a center axis, framerate drops when there's really nothing on the screen and other issues make it all feel lame.    Recycling this tedium are a handful of woefully unbalanced challenges that feel redundant. Consistency, Racing and Speed challenges really just boil down to ~get into first as quickly as possible and stay there,~ while the Accuracy challenges are finished by just dropping back behind the pack and slapping yourself in the face to stay awake long enough to finish the challenge. They're the only way to unlock some tracks and vehicle types, though, so if for some reason you've been struck dumb and just can't get enough o' them dirt circles, you're going to have to suffer through the challenges.    The best part of the game? I know it sounds like I'm bagging on the sport of sprint car racing, but as the now-defunct developer Ratbag proved with World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002, the races can actually be fun if done right. N64-era car models sporting a weird sense of scale (even the smallest ones, judging by the people in the stands, are monster truck huge), pointless motion blur and hilariously low-res textures prove that Sprint Cars 2 can't even look right. With all the different adjustments to ride height, shocks and upgradable vehicles, you can tell developer Big Ant Studios at least wanted to offer some depth, but the simple fact is there's almost nothing redeeming about the actual races.    I mentioned it at the start of the review, but the tractor pull mode is easily the most entertaining part of the game. If you get good enough at balancing engine heat with increasing amounts of weight, the game will spit out a code that lets you plug in your distance and get ranked on leaderboards. You can do the same for the Time Trials too, but that would require actually playing through the regular racing part of the game, and I think it's fairly established by now how that turned out.Even the game box can't manage to accurately portray what's burned on to the disc inside. There's a screen of a cockpit view, though near as I can tell that doesn't exist, and claims of ~spectacular crashes~ and ~serious vehicle damage~ are hilariously wrong. When 95% of the game is about as entertaining as getting blackout drunk and body surfing on gravel, it should be avoided at all costs. Come to think of it, both of those things should probably be avoided.", "date": "Apr 10, 2008"}
