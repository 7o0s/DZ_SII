Balls of Fury? Not exactly a franchise that'd set off a bidding war at the big boy publishers. Destination Software snagged it, and admittedly there's enough going on in the film for a quality game design team to make a decent ping pong game. And believe it or not, Balls of Fury on the Nintendo DS didn't turn out all that bad: it's a sharp, challenging game of table tennis. Its problem, however, is two-fold: it's a straightforward design that lacks in variety, and it takes itself far too seriously.   Balls of Fury the movie might've come and gone in a matter of weeks with generally average-to-poor reviews, but its intentions were obvious from the start: it was meant to be an over-the-top satire of martial arts flicks using ping-pong in place of combat. Balls of Fury, however, gets right to business: it's just Ping-Pong without the satire. Right at the start, the game's story mode pretty much sucks all the funny out the movie's plot, telling the tale as if it was some sort of serious account of the rise and fall and rise of some professional Ping Pong player. The text reads as if it was a courtroom account of what happened in the flick, removing any sort of humor that might've been left around for the player to discover.   What's left? Ping Pong. An actual, halfway decent playing game of Ping Pong. Officially, it's Table Tennis, as Ping Pong is a registered trademark - the Q-tip of cottonswabs, and the Kleenex of tissue paper. But we all know better.   Anyway, the game uses the touch screen much like every other Pong clone to hit the Nintendo DS: Stylus on the paddle, and move it back and forth to keep the ball in play. The upper screen shows a rendered representation of the character from the movie you're playing who animates rather rigidly with admittedly repetitive movement: either a swing animation, a win animation or a lose animation. At least it's riotous playing against Christopher Walkenor at least the 3D modeler's representation of him, which gets as close without requiring likeness rights.   But it's the action that's key in Balls of Fury, and Black Lantern Studio (the team responsible for the Nintendo DS design) built a tight and fun playing Ping Pong game. The control takes into account paddle motion, so if you whack it forward and to the right at the right time will send the ball in that direction. There's also the ~English~ function: push left or right on the D-pad (or for you lefties, Y or A) to send the ball with a spin, skewing it in the spin's direction to screw with the other player.      And then there's the ~power move~ option, and I guess this is where the ~over the top~ Balls of Fury comes in play. Build up a bar on the left of the screen during a rally and you can perform a random power move by pushing up and down on the D-pad (or, again, for lefties: X or B) which will pull off crazy moves to make it hard to track where the ball's going to go - loops, zig-zags, power shots, and one that causes the ball to stick for a second, then get sent off in a different direction. Utilizing these shots is pretty key since it's a lot harder to follow the ball when it's going all crazy. However, there are some unfair elements to it: on occasion, the ball can skew off the edge high on the table, which makes it impossible to reach even if you were following it - the game implements an invisible wall about a fifth of the way up the table, preventing you from charging the net. So having the ball dribble high off the table is just a little underhanded.   There's also a ~taunt~ function using the shoulder button that, along with playing a repetitive sound clip from the flick, causes a brief graphics flash on the other person's screen. It's not something that's so drastic that it'll screw up a real life opponent - it seems like the computer AI falls for it much more often.   Oh, and God bless Xbox 360 and its Achievement system - Balls of Fury is another game to take this concept and run with it. You earn trophies for specific victories in the single player and multiplayer match-ups, which definitely encourage playing through if only to build up your brag wall.   Yep, it's Ping Pong. Butthat's all it is. It also could have been so much more. The movie satirizes martial arts movies, the game could have satirized fighting games, injecting humor into a solid Ping Pong product. Instead, it's dry as an overcooked turkey and about as repetitive as you'd expect whacking a white ball back and forth would be. There's very little variety in this game, apart from one of the dumbest mini-games ever conceived (smashing bees during the credits sequence). Visually the game's not a bad little Nintendo DS title, but the soundtrack playing during the action is the absolute pits. Yep, I was surprised that Balls of Fury turned out to be a playable, challenging game of Table Tennis on the Nintendo DS. The license is barely used and the design's about as funny as an episode of Small Wonder, but at least the Ping Pong is solid.", "date": "Oct 9, 2007"}
