Zoo Tycoon DS has sucked the will to live out of my eyeballs and left me with nothing but cramped hands. What was essentially a boring game on the PC back in 2001 has been made into a boring game with a bad interface in 2005. Sure, the DS doesn't have all of the capabilities that a PC does (even back in 2001) but good grief. I can't remember the last time I saw such an ugly game with so many deficiencies.    Even though Zoo Tycoon wasn't the best game in the world, there was some appeal to it on the PC, especially given the high number of tycoon games and their popularity with the family crowd. In short, players are charged with building up zoos which includes creating exhibits for animals and comfort for guests. Sounds at least decent, yes? With a mouse and keyboard, this is a pretty easy exercise. The challenge (if you can call it that) is really keeping the money up to build expensive exhibits.   The DS version of this game suffers for a lot of reasons but the most evident of these are the terrible visuals. This game looks really, really, really bad. Sprites are barely recognizable even at the closest level of zoom so that you can't enjoy the different types of animals. Animations are downright pathetic by today's standards, which isn't surprising considering the previous statement. There's simply no personality in any of the art. I know the DS isn't the graphical powerhouse that a PC or console can be, but even Christy Brown and his wonderful foot could have done a better job than this.   Sadly, the ugliness is not only skin deep. Aside from being unforgivably boring in general (doctor, I can't find a pulse), thanks largely to an excessive level of hand-holding, the interface, one of the most important things in a tycoon game, doesn't seem to have been thought through. During the few hours I've had with the game, I've found numerous changes that could have been made to take better advantage of the stylus, make information more accessible, and cages easier to build. Some clever ideas haven't been fleshed out enough to make gameplay any more convenient or information easier to find.   Even some of the most important gameplay issues have problems. Cages are entirely too big a pain in the ass to create. Getting the right shape can be trial and error thanks to their drag and create idea that unfortunately doesn't allow for mixing and matching cage types. So if you build a large concrete wall that people can't see through, there's no way of editing the cage to add pieces with windows. If there is a way to add different pieces on top of the ones you have, or merge two enclosures into a bigger one (you can only create very small cages in this game), I can't find it anywhere in the manual, tutorials, or interface.   Outside of those mistakes, there are just more problems that make the game a tad bit more aggravating. For example, the tasks in the early easy missions are very easy to complete. Unfortunately when the game says you have to complete the tasks within 6 months, it mean you have to wait six months before the you can complete the scenario. In each of the first three easy missions I had completed the tasks within a month and then was forced to sit around for five more months to win the scenario and move on to the next set of scenarios. This is not a game I would recommend to anyone. There's very little to redeem a generally poor effort to create a tycoon game for the DS that has any personality or creates any real fun for the player.", "date": "Nov 1, 2005"}
