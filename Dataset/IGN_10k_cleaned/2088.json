Of course, Acclaim has enlisted the help of premiere developer Iguana Entertainment, the same team responsible for Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Somehow, nobody's laughing anymore.  Getting right down to business, NFL Quarterback Club '98 is the best-looking football game yet. Running in hi-res (640x480) mode, everything from the field to the players has a polished look to it. Critics had claimed that a hi-res mode wasn't possible; that it would slow any N64 game down so that it was virtually unplayable. They were obviously wrong.  Player animation is fluid and realistic, though the 3D models in the game aren't quite as well built as those found in Madden 64. Also, players move a bit slower than those in EA's football title, but the difference is minimal.  QB Club '98 has spared no expense in creating the most vivid football experience yet on a next-generation system. Players have realtime shadows, noticeable breath in frigid weather, and detailed uniforms and helmets. Hell, it's so real one can almost see the hair on their arms.  Rumble Pak support has also been included, but much like Madden 64, it really has no bearing on gameplay. Players collide with each other or dive for the ball and the controllers will give off a small rumble. Once again, it's an added enhancement we're better off for the having, but probably wouldn't have missed it were it gone.  Unlike Madden 64, Acclaim's NFL QB Club '98 features the full NFL license so expect to see real teams, real player names and stats, real stadiums and real team colors. This comes in handy for football maniacs who won't even consider a game of this type unless it includes all of the up-to-date statistics.  Acclaim has included a plethora of options to keep players coming back for more. Enter a new season, tournament, preseason, or the playoffs. Check out the profiles off all your favorite quarterbacks in their profiler menu, go straight to the cheat menu or manage the rosters. There's even a quick play choice to start the game without fooling around with anything else.   What's sure to impress seasoned football gurus, however, is the ability to re-play historic simulations. For example, take on the role of the Bengals against San Francisco in Super Bowl XVI. The simulation starts the Bengals off in the third quarter and gives players a chance to re-claim the Superbowl title.  And gameplay is smooth, fun, and for the most part runs along at good speeds. Players animate well and you can see the ball catch right in a player's hands on a successful pass. It's very rewarding and a blast to watch. Don't get us started on the instant replay feature or this review will turn into a book. Let's just say it rocks!  You might be wondering if there are any problems with the game at all? Unfortunately, there are a few. While the game looks absolutely beautiful it does run a bit slower than Madden 64. This doesn't change our opinion of gameplay, as it's still OK, but we would be lying if we said we didn't notice a difference.  The biggest difference between the two games is in their artificial intelligence. Madden 64 has AI second to none and while Acclaim's QB Club '98 also has decent AI, it's not up to par with what Madden has going. Players perform the regular routines; blocking, diving, running formations and so on, but unlike Madden, they don't seem to be doing any of this intelligently.  Lastly, the sound. Marv Albert, who recently got off on all charges, is doing the play-by-play voice-overs and boy, are they dull. The crowd cheers, too, but it's nowhere near the sound found in a football title like Sony's Gameday '98.    What it comes down is this: Acclaim's NFL QB Club '98, despite a few minor drawbacks, is a shining example of what's technically possible on Nintendo 64. Additionally, it's got the full NFL license, a hi-res mode that can't be touched by anything else on the market and, AI issues aside, a solid gameplay experience.
