Most rarely manage to replicate any sense of speed, which is absolutely essential for a decent racer. The best efforts so far have been top-view RC racers that even remotely try to mimic real-world racing events. But the genre's bad track record has stopped THQ Wireless from the proverbial college try with MotoGP 2, a motorcycle racer.   Features:   Multiple tracks  Multiple riders  Varying weather conditions   MotoGP 2 will remind most players of the seminal motorcycle racing game, Hang-On. That's a compliment, as the SEGA classic was one of the best arcade racers until Daytona USA came along and took the cup. (And for many gamers, it still hasn't relinquished it.)   The game is played entirely from behind-the-bike, as you have a constant view of your rider's caboose. From this angle, you really have to pay attention to curve warnings, as it's hard to get a real feel for upcoming turns. Positioning the camera back there, though, does manage to help convey a certain sense of velocity. It's not ferocious or overly impressive, but it's at least definitely present.   MotoGP 2 offers a solid collection of tracks to play on, including classic courses like Suzuki, which has probably appeared more racing games than the Indy 500. When you play an individual track, you can change the weather conditions, which actually have an affect on the race itself. Sunny afternoons give you excellent traction, while a downpour really makes turning a tricky proposition.   Control is pretty tight. From the starting line, you accelerate your ride by pressing up on the touchpad. Turning is naturally handled by pressing left and right -- depending on how long you hold in one direction determines the sharpness of your turn. When you approach hairpins, you're going to need to back off on the gas (press down) before attempting the turn. Most hairpins just cannot be negotiated at full speed.   Unless you are absolutely awful racer, you will always see your competition on the track around you. Jockeying for position is half the challenge, as the other bikes race like you're not even there.  The game doesn't have a terribly steep learning curve, but it will take you a few minutes to get used to making turns and figure out how to safely weave between rival racers.   MotoGP 2 offers a few gameplay modes to choose from, but you'll sleep fine at night if you never play Stunt Mode. It sounds like you get to fly off killer jumps and whatnot. You don't. You earn points for steering around racers. Huzzah! The better choice is to create a racer from scratch and work your way through the ranks, earning points to beef up his skillz. However, you'd be wise to practice up on those tracks before risking your career.   THQ Wireless really did a nice job with MotoGP 2's look. The tracks and well-designed, but it's the little touches that will really please fans. On stretches where you can really jam up the speed, motion lines try to help create that aforementioned sense of speed. When racing during a storm, water droplets appear on the screen. And from time to time, your racer will look over his shoulder for other bikes. Good stuff. Its too bad the game doesn't match the visuals with impressive sound. Come on, no roaring engine noise?  MotoGP 2 is a great sequel to the ubiquitous MotoGP that has been floating around systems for so long. I was able to try it on a new LG VX7000, and the game not only looked great, but it handled incredibly well, too. THQ Wireless has a solid winner with this little racer, and if you see it on your deck, it's a good choice. I wish it had a greater sense of speed, but them's the breaks (hey-o!).", "date": "Sep 16, 2004"}
