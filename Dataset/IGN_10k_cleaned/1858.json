And animation was without form, and void; and uncertain focus was upon the face of the artform.  And the expanded consciousness of Go Nagai moved upon the face of the waters.  And Go Nagai said, Let there be giant robots, and there were giant robots.  And Go Nagai saw the giant robots, that they were good.  And then he went on to create the flash transformation sequence and pointless violence, which were also good, but less good than the giant robots, for Mazinger Z whomped titanic ass.  And Yoshiyuki Tomino said, Let these giant robots be taken seriously, and there was Mobile Suit Gundam.  And this was also pretty freakin' good, and much time passed before Brain Powerd came along to blight his legacy and make us all wonder where his mind had gone.  And Izutaka Yohbuchi said, Let these giant robots look really bitchin' cool, and there was Aura Battler Dunbine; and Mamoru Nagano said, I'm gonna one-up that no problem, and there was Five Star Stories.  And many argued the merit of their stories, but none denied that those were some damn fine-looking giant robots.  And Wave and Kaiyodo made a whole lot of money off of supremely cool garage kits, which was good for them, at least.  And Hideako Anno said, Let there be lots of angst surrounding these giant robots, and there was Evangelion.  And this was not good, but eventually everyone ignored it and he made Love and Pop and KareKano and went away.  And finally, at the close of the century that saw giant robots come into their own, Noriaki Okamura and Yoji Shinkawa and Hideo Kojima said, This would make a pretty neat videogame on PS2, and there was Z.O.E.  And while it was not as good as any of the above, except for maybe Love and Pop and the lousier bits of Evangelion, it was still pretty cool.  Review Philosophy  It has some serious drawbacks, however, ones which angered me sufficiently to provoke an admonition from my editor, who suggested that I ought to very carefully weigh Z.O.E's good points and bad points when coming up with a conclusive statement on the game.  Ruthless objectivity was called for, and so I enlisted the aid of my faithful associate, compatriot, colleague, and brute fixer, Gogg.      Obviously, none could question the objectivity of Gogg.  Or they could, but he would rip their heads off with his fully poseable claws directly thereafter, so it would be wiser if they did not bother.  And so we shall go through Z.O.E's various qualities point by point, with comments by myself and objective judgments from Gogg.  Gogg will deliver his opinions in a thoroughly objective fashion: two slayers up representing approval, two slayers down representing displeasure, and one apiece representing ambivalence.  Gameplay      Any problems that Z.O.E has lie outside that initial moment of oneness with the mecha.  When you first charge in to battle with your hands on the controls, the game is perfect.  At the best of times, this game feels and behaves absolutely right.  There are games that have handled with an equal degree of surety, but never in the context of such a complex control scheme and game world.  Nothing even comes close to how well it handles the thorny problems of 3D movement and camera control -- heck, Tomb Raider and its ilk can't even handle movement on two axes, let alone three, but Z.O.E does it without a hitch and at a breakneck pace to boot.  It does this, to be sure, by handing a great deal over to shorthand and automatic systems (particularly an ace derivative of the Zelda 64 lock-on), but at that moment I do not particularly care, because I feel as if I'm in complete control.  More than that, I feel as if I'm in a massive beautiful robot slashing evil robots to pieces with my mighty beam swords and deadly rocket punch and homing lasers and energy mines and ALL KINDS OF WONDERFUL EXPLOSIVE THINGS.  No mech game has come close to this sensation, not Armored Core or Gun Griffon or anything else before, fine though those games were.  It's a little while later that other issues start to arise, although they never become so significant that I'd consider this a failure of gameplay design.  Far from it -- the core controls and camera system here are rock solid.  But the game elements that surround and house them, that make them more than just nifty feats of technology, have a few problems.  Most significant is that, as many import players have complained, the game does get repetitive at times.  For example, there's not a great deal of variety to the enemies you fight.  Aside from the four bosses (or five, depending on how you tally things), there are essentially three basic enemy types throughout the entire game, two of which behave almost identically.  The game does its damnedest to make the most of that limitation, presenting different types of encounters shaped by the levels around you and the constraints of protecting survivors, but the dash-dash-slash-slash motion will certainly become second nature long before the game is over.  Of course, so did the jump kick in Streets of Rage, and most would venerate that game as a classic.  But that was a couple of generations ago, and in the intervening time I've played a fistful of action games and shooters that managed to interest me in sustained combat to a much greater degree than Z.O.E.  They also offered more of a challenge.  Playing on Hard difficulty, my deaths came mainly through carelessness, rather than lack of skill or overwhelming opposition.  Respect does go out to the boss encounters in this game.  There are five of them, and they're all very well-designed.  The difficulty level ramps up smoothly, and they present plenty of different patterns to learn and attacks to avoid.  I just wish the same could be said of the regular battles -- the enemies increase in difficulty somewhat, but you can still mow through them with more or less the same set of tactics from the beginning of the game to the end.  The only spots of variety are provided by the rescue missions, where you have to protect the city around you from damage or face a poor performance rating (which affects the ending you get).  I wish there were more encounters like that, variations on the theme of protection (escort missions, maybe) and other battles where the environment was a significant factor (like a fortress assault, with defensive batteries hassling you along with the mobile enemies).  Unfortunately, most of the missions are just open-air free-for-alls.  The camera starts to get very fussy in the few battles where you're in a confined situation (although the lock-on scheme generally saves you from dying cheaply), and when you want to focus on a point in the area rather than an enemy (this happens once during the later missions, and would happen a lot more if the level designers had included more tasks of that sort) the camera and lock-on do their level best to thwart you.  To conclude the list of gripes, I'm not all that high on Z.O.E's puzzle design, which consists mainly of a lot of Resident Evil-style fetching and carrying.  In particular, there's one quest that doesn't include near enough in the way of pointers to your destination -- you just have to wander around areas you've already explored (and where enemies continuously respawn) and scour the turf for an item that's hard to make out unless you're right on it.  Oh, well; perhaps my skills are just fading away in my old age...  Graphics      And it's not as if staring at Z.O.E for hours is that unpleasant an experience, if you happen to have some time on your hands.  This is an extremely beautiful game.  Those who enjoy dithering about that sort of thing are welcome to debate the comparative technical issues, but for my money, either Z.O.E or Klonoa 2 is the best-looking game on PS2 so far.  The capabilities of a game's 3D engine are only half of the graphics coin, if even that -- it's what you do with it that counts, the skill of the artists that shape a game's graphics, and Z.O.E was shaped by some extremely skilled hands.  Mechanical designer Yoji Shinkawa receives much of the credit (and I also sense his hand in the absolutely brilliant HUD design).  I adore the mech designs here, from their faceless heads to their pointy...stumps, I guess, or whatever you'd like to call the termini of their legs.  The 3D artists did a brilliant job of bringing them to life, with smooth edges all over, animating trails of energy around limbs and joints, great highlighting on smooth surfaces, and lovely lighting and particle effects coming from thinks like Jehuty's wings and vernier thrusters.  The animation never skips a beat, with all kinds of different motions for zipping this way and that, accompanied by light trails and bursts of particles  The levels, though somewhat uniform in their style (some chunks of the colony could easily be mistaken for others), are huge, detailed, and marvelously interactive.  Almost all of the many buildings, bridges, and other bits of twinkling architecture can be smashed and burned, which lends a great atmosphere to the battles -- while you're locked in combat with an enemy frame, there are all kinds of lights and explosions going off around you, as well as a sparingly-used motion blur effect.  Every area has an invisible barrier around it, but they're none of them too small, and the city areas pack all the space inside with things to look at, wander around, and blow up if you're in a destructive mood.  Topping it all off is the lovely background of the colony shell and a massive Jupiter in the background.  Sound      Z.O.E is as nice to listen to as it is to look at -- I already have the OP theme single; now I need to hunt down the full soundtrack album.  The balance of the musical score is excellently suited to the action and visuals it supports, with pulsing techno beats matching the energy flowing through Jehuty's body, and I love the new-agey theme music.  I get annoyed when the soundtrack goes all emotional and piano-ey during the purportedly serious bits, but page down to the ~Story~ header for all the bile you need in that category.  Anyway, those parts are over soon enough, and it's back to a thumping beat and mighty explosions echoing across the colony, punctuated with the zips and zaps of energy weaponry.  But then somebody opens their mouth to talk...  Localization      I'll lead with my one (almost) unequivocally positive comment: They left the ending themes alone (or one of them at least; I still can't quite get the other).  And the opening theme has been changed, but only to replace one chunk of gibberish with another, which makes me wonder why Konami bothered.  Taking everything else into consideration, Gogg would rather deliver two upraised middle fingers in this category.  Bound as he is by the conventions of propriety, the above will have to suffice.  While I warmed up to the dub and text a trifle by the end of the game, Z.O.E's localization is still quite poor, nowhere near up to the standard Konami set with Metal Gear Solid.  The voices range from okay (ADA, although I still like the Japanese voice better) to  tolerable (Viola, Elena, Celvice) to violently infuriating (LEO WITH A BULLET).  The actors aren't helped by a text translation that forces them to repeat lines no human would ever actually speak.  Compounding the aggravation in this area is the absence of a Japanese voice track.  This is not acceptable.  With however many gigabytes of space available to the creators (Z.O.E uses DVD-ROM media), I don't understand why they couldn't shoehorn an extra set of voices in, considering that Square managed to do so with The Bouncer, likewise Capcom with Onimusha (both of which were crammed to the gills with FMV and other hefty chunks of pre-rendered art).  I like my cartoons subtitled, and if a dub like this is the best I'm offered, I demand them subtitled.  Story      Damn translation queers this one so...  Having played through it from beginning to end, I'm not sure I enjoy Z.O.E's story or not.  It moved me on occasion, but on another level I'm bothered when something like this makes so blatant an appeal to my emotions.  See, I am nothing if not a sentimental fool.  I'm a dead sucker for attempts to tug at my heartstrings.  But if they get yanked on hard enough, I start to get a little suspicious, and that happened from time to time throughout this game.  It is, as promised, a shameless tearjerker, and I don't feel like it works hard enough for the tears that it tries to inspire.  Its length is perhaps a problem.  My first time through on Hard mode resulted in a clear time of 4:41, mainly combat and wandering around, which leaves very little time to build the characters and situations enough to inspire an honest emotional reaction.  The game world and backstory receive almost no introduction -- I was familiar with them only thanks to all the background information on KCEJ's webpage.  I enjoyed ADA's arc of development, as the soulless AI gradually develops a personality, but the rest of the characters failed to move me, or moved my unconscious emotions while my conscious mind was annoyed by how the game was trying to manipulate me.  Leo is the prime offender here.  The American voice acting doesn't help one bit, but even aside from that, he doesn't impress me as a hero.  He is a student of the Shinji Ikari/Akito Tenkawa whinging-pustule school of mecha piloting, as opposed to the Domon Kasshu/Char Aznable/Noa Izumi savage-asskicking-beast-unchained school.  For the most part, he made me want to whack him upside the head, not cheer him on to victory.  Meanwhile, Celvice is a cipher, there simply to serve as the girl in jeopardy, and Viola seems a little bit like Rose in Legend of Dragoon.  She's a character with boundless potential, but the lack of screen time for development means she isn't used anywhere near as well as she might have been. Oh, what might have been.Or what might be, alternatively.  The people who created Z.O.E obviously have tremendous talent.  The 3D engine and control scheme they have created are absolutely marvelous, and the game's visual designs are top-notch.  It has flashes of brilliant scenario design, and yes, there are a few character moments I liked.  So I hope their next game builds on those strengths, and does something about the problems I've already discussed at length.And there probably will be a next game.  The conclusion of Z.O.E lacks only a giant Big O-esque ~Sequel Coming Summer 2002~ placard.  If and when that sequel does come, I have high hopes for it.  Since the tasks of producing the engine and core gameplay are complete, its designers and programmers have plenty of time to add more variety in areas like level design, enemies, puzzles, and the like.  With luck, the screenwriters will try to earn my tears a little more honestly.  And maybe whoever handles the localization will learn the virtue of a hands-off approach.", "date": "Mar 27, 2001"}
