The end result has typically been a product that only appeals to die-hard fans of college sports.  NCAA March Madness 2000 from EA Sports is one of the few college sports games that completely out-classes its professional counterpart. In almost every way imaginable, March Madness 2000 is superior to NBA Live 2000 and 989 Sports' NBA ShootOut 2000.   Gameplay March Madness 2000 features all of the game options that have become the norm with basketball videogames, such as the ability to play in arcade or simulation modes, and adjust the game rules and options. What separates March Madness 2000 from its professional and collegiate competition is that it has more options than any other sports game, most of which greatly enhance the overall quality of the game.  Firstly, one of the core problems with most basketball videogames is that the stats at the end of the game by and large don't mimic what happens in the real world. For example, in NBA Live 2000, the computer-controlled team normally finished the game with an overall shooting percentage of less then 35% (even on the highest difficulty setting).   The CPU was able to stay competitive by getting a lot of turnovers and dominating the offensive boards. All of this produced a game that didn't feel authentic to the real NBA basketball experience. In general, an excess of blocked shots, steals, and outrageous slam-dunks dominates most basketball videogames.   On the default setting, March Madness fits with this tendency. However, in the Game Options, the player has the ability to adjust Game Speed, Shot Difficulty, Deflect Difficulty, Block Frequency, Steal Frequency, and the Dunk Window. Having the ability to adjust each of these options gives the player the capability to mold the game to fit his or her preference. After a few games, messing around with each of the gauges, the game can be setup where the statistics end up being fairly realistic.   Another aspect that is generally not handled well in basketball videogames is the control given to the game player over the player's actions. In most cases, only one or two buttons are presented to the game player to perform special moves. The player has never really been given the option of choosing the exact special move to perform.   With its trademarked ~Dynamic Ball Control,~ March Madness 2000 succeeds in giving the game player more ball handling control than any game before it. Performing moves such as cross dribbles, between the leg dribbles, and spins are all now completely under the control of the player. There's still a button that is mapped for a random computer-picked move, but if the player wishes to execute a specific move, it's now possible.   Other issues that are not commonly handled well in basketball videogames are long rebounds, rebounds in general, and the posting-up of other players. Once again, March Madness deals with these matters better than any other game on the market. The ball physics are the best yet for any basketball videogame.   There are a wide array of missed shots, made shots and realistic bounces off of the rim. Most importantly, there are long rebounds in the game. This is a dimension ignored in most basketball videogames and helps create an authentic basketball experience. In real-life, long rebounds greatly affect the games because they typically are the start of fast breaks. Finally, this factor is represented in some form in a videogame.   In most other games the majority of rebounds are acquire with both feet on the ground. It's been handled much better in recent years, but never as well as in March Madness 2000. While there are still plenty of loose-ball rebounds (and those do happen in real-life, too), the majority of rebounds are obtained by players that are jumping. Additionally, CPU controlled teammates and opposing players will actually try and box out other players when preparing for a rebound. This is rarely seen in other basketball games.     Alas, March Madness 2000 is still far from perfect. For one, it could use some tweaking to its Create a Player option. The game player is given the ability to create a player with a wide range of attributes. There are 36 heads, and numerous traits that can be adjusted. The problem is that it's way too easy to make a dominant player. Creating a super-fast, 7'2~ monster that's deadly from inside and outside, and is a shot blocking, ball-stealing maniac is very easy to do. This is something that shouldn't be possible without the use of some kind of cheat code.   An added complaint is that the game's load times are terrible. The load after half time is nearly 10 seconds and what makes this worse is that there's not a visual sign that the game's loading. The first time this happens it gives the impression that the game has locked-up or crashed. The bad load times are also apparent when going through the teams when creating a player. Each team's uniform must load up and it takes a few seconds for each. Considering that it won't let you quickly pass through teams and there are over 150 men's Division I teams in the game, this can be extremely time consuming (and particularly annoying).   The single largest negative with March Madness 2000 is the various AI problems that crop up at times. It's a common occurrence to see the computer-controlled opponent run the ball straight out of bounds after receiving a pass. At times, the computer-controlled teammates will do some weird things like run to the other side of the court for no apparent reason. Don't be surprised if you find yourself in a brief one-on-five situation because your teammates ran back past you.   Furthermore, there are some problems with the game's challenge. With the difficulty set to Senior (the highest setting), it should be close to impossible for a player to use a low rated team like Dartmouth to beat a highly ranked team like the Duke Blue Devils. In March Madness 2000, using a horrible team to beat one of the top teams is challenging but not really that hard to do.   Graphics This year's crop of basketball games put out a bunch of titles that seemed all seemed to have various graphical problems. Live 2000 had some really good player animations, but had a sometimes-unbearable framerate. With ShootOut 200, the overall animation wasn't up to the quality of Live, but its framerate was slightly better. And, with Fox Sports' effort, NBA Basketball 2000, it had fluid animation and a solid framerate, but lacked the large variety of animations that others had.   Much like its competitors, March Madness 2000 has its pluses and minus. On the plus side, the speed of the game is superior to every other non-arcade-style basketball game on the PlayStation. If anything, the game might just move a little too quickly (not a negative, though, because game speed can be adjusted in the options menu). There is also a plethora of different animations such as nine different dunks, ankle breakers, spins, crossovers, jabs, and stutter steps.   On the other hand, while there is a range of different animations, the animations don't always seem complete. Certain moves seem to be missing some frames of animation that should be in there. This was obviously a sacrifice that was made to increase the game's framerate.   Also, the game does have some collision detection problems. There will occasionally be blocked shots and deflections that don't appear to actually happen. The player models also meld together on occasion and all of the players seem to slide around the screen, giving the impression that they're on skates.    Sound The area where March Madness 2000 stands out the most is the sound. The developers went all out in trying to recreate the college atmosphere in the game and have been tremendously successful. The game features dynamic crowds, and authentic crowd chants, cheer squads, bands, drum cadences, and fight songs. Over 80 crowd chants and 60 fight songs were recorded for use in this game.   The authentic songs, chants, and crowd noises do a tremendous job of immersing the player in a lifelike college basketball atmosphere. No other college basketball game on the PlayStation manages to excel as much as March Madness 2000 in doing this.   The sounds of the bouncing balls, occasional shoe squeaks, and the ball hitting off of the rim and backboards are also completely lifelike. The only negative in the audio department is the fact that the play-by-play by Dick Vitale seems lacking. Vitale is known for not being able to shut his trap, and he keeps quiet way too much while providing the commentary for the game. While it still has a lot of flaws and is far from perfect, March Madness 2000 is the best basketball game on the PlayStation. Unless you must have a game with the NBA players, there's no reason to pass up March Madness for any other basketball videogame on this system. Believe me, I'm just as surprised about this as you probably are.", "date": "Dec 24, 1999"}
