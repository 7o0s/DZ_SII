We can deal with overly-cute designs in common household electronic devices, and we're even getting to like the hyper-happy pop music. But all these Pokmon clones ... frankly, we just don't know what to do with them anymore. Not that you're not doing a good job on them -- nobody does 'em better, no doubt. But your country just makes so many of them! We're wondering if we haven't already collected 'em all ...Features180 Robopon creaturesLink cable support for four players (single and multiple cartridge options)Battery saveOnly for Game Boy AdvanceThere's not a thing wrong with Robopon 2, Hudson's sequel (distributed in America by fellow RPG adventurers Atlus) to the Game Boy Color RPG about a kid who goes around collecting robots to use in battle against other people's collected robots. Aside from some muted visuals and a strictly linear quest, the game is an enjoyable adventure with a complex battle system.The only problem? It's not Pokmon.Nintendo's classic set of pocket monsters haunted the first Robopon, and even though Nintendo hasn't yet delivered its long-awaited new color set, Hudson still couldn't shake the phenom despite the changes made for the sequel. But (with help from Red Entertainment on the sequel) they did admirably try. For one, the battle system is miles away from Pokmon, and probably betters Nintendo's for those seeking complexity. The more traditional RPG battles of four Robopon facing off as a team against a squad of enemies allows for more strategy and challenge. Unfortunately, you usually don't get much out of it -- the quest stretches for a while, but early battle planning and a cheater's reset when luck doesn't go your way allows you to get through most battles without too many hardships (the game expects you to experiment with many different Robopon creations, but if all you want to do is beat it for the end sequence with a dedicated team that you carefully choose and train, you've got an easy road ahead.) Your Robopon creations can be armed with different weapons and spells unique to their special types, and the game further challenges your tactical battle skills by enabling certain combinations of Robopon or ~software~ spell enhancements to unleash more powerful attacks that lay waste to whole crews of attackers or give an early attack window. And for those not excited by the randomness of most monster battlers, Robopon players can create whichever creatures they wish by combining the monster-creating batteries found along the way -- you can hold off on using rare batteries until you've got two unique ones together, or else just spark that rare battery with whatever's in your pack to see what you might get.Robopon 2's story is also more integral than Pokmon's battle league design. You return as the boy who conquered the previous game's baddie boss and became a Leader1-ranked Robopon player. Left without any of his powered-up Robopon creatures from the last game after a shipwreck that leaves him in a land tormented by a mysterious conqueror, you embark on a quest to collect new Robopon and destroy this evil masked man in the grand Robopon tournament. Alright, not exactly epic storytelling, but the quest has its charms. Dialog can be hit and miss (why does every RPG translator feel the need to give big ups to Flavor Flav?), but there are some genuinely funny and interesting sequences -- one has a flunkie constantly falling on his head trying to obey the orders of his circus ringmaster boss. Hudson has borrowed the Link to the Past trick of reusing a designed land over again by having the character travel forwards and backwards in time, and while players won't get to play around with time paradoxes or alternate time periods as much as you'd like (the quest is almost completely linear), they do get some mileage out of the chrono-shifting -- one encounter has you meeting a talking dog; a trip through the ages brings you back 20 years where you meet a scientist experimenting with transmogrifying humans and dogs.The question remains: could you go for another Pokmon? Gamers new to the series may not be blown away by what's here. Despite the attempt to get away from Pokmon, the new battle engine instead feels a lot more like all of the other RPGs out there. The quest is also very linear -- it's fun to run through, but for a game that encourages replay, there's not a lot of surprises for a second voyage. And the visuals, while occasionally making use of the GBA's advanced techniques of rotation and scaling, just aren't as expressive as the GBA's standard bearers.On the other hand, Hudson has put together a strong package -- and the value of Robopon 2 jumps exponentially if your friends have an alternate copy of the game (Atlus is releasing 2 versions of the game, with similar quests but different random Robopon to find). With other players, you can combine rare Robopon sparkers across game cartridges for exclusive Robopon creations, pit your uniquely-trained Robopon against each other in battle, or challenge up to 4 players (hurray) in special mini-games with your special collection of creatures. Fans of the original Robopon will also get a kick out of the way Hudson has taken the story and original characters to a new world. If you're a collector of these pocket monster games and have friends who'd play along, this one's good to kick around; otherwise, check your RPG stack and see if you're in need of something new. Just remember that you'll be waiting a long time for Nintendo's next ball to open...", "date": "Jul 11, 2002"}
