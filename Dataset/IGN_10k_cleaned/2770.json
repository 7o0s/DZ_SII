It was a hugely ambitious project...HotGen, the Game Boy development team who later worked on Activision's Mat Hoffman series for the GBC and Game Boy Advance, attempted the impossible with the portable Resident Evil, converting the game into the extremely limited handheld hardware and sandwiching all the artwork into the cartridge. Perhaps it was too much for the system to handle, for almost two year after the project began, Capcom pulled the plug on the development. It never saw a public release.  That wasn't the end of the tale, however...a few months after Resident Evil 's demise, another Game Boy development house, M4, announced a brand new Resident Evil adventure for the GBC: a side-story featuring characters from past Resident Evil console games. Resident Evil Gaiden they called it, and it was released during the holidays in Europe. Capcom decided to release the game in the US in limited numbers, and it shipped to stores last month. The game, unfortunately, lacks the Resident Evil charm...this GBC game reduces the whole Resident Evil game into a search-and-unlock challenge with action sequences that are better suited for a game of golf than the world of Survival Horror. Features Three playable characters 100 different rooms Battery save (three slots) Only for Game Boy Advance Resident Evil Gaiden opens with Barry Burton, member of S.T.A.R.S., boarding a huge luxury liner floating on the Atlantic, almost as a ghost ship. He was summoned to the scene when S.T.A.R.S. discovered that bio-organic weapon developed at the evil Umbrella corporation had escaped onto the ship...Leon Kennedy was sent to investigate the ship, but disappeared...and now it's up to you, as Barry, to figure out just what the heck is going on.  Throw whatever you're expecting of a Resident Evil game out the window...this Game Boy Color design doesn't feature the trademark multiple camera angles that all Resident Evil adventures utilize. The Game Boy Color and its limited graphics capabilities are admittedly not up to the task of recreating a true RE design...the developer instead worked a more GBC-friendly top-down perspective for the exploration. This makes the game look a heck of a lot like Konami's Metal Gear Solid port for the handheld...but don't expect anywhere near the challenge of MGS in Resident Evil Gaiden.  It's the combat that really sucks the fun out of this game...instead of having full control over the zombie-killing, every zombie encounter kicks you to an extremely lame first-person mode where you have to push the action button at the proper moment. Picture this as a deadman's  golf game, since all you're really doing is timing a quick moving icon on a long horizontal bar, hitting the button as close to the target location in order to hit the enemies with your weapon. When compared to the real-time action of all the other Resident Evil games, this combat is lame. Actually, it's lame without the comparison.  But it's not just the combat that makes this game dull...Resident Evil Gaiden doesn't really have any real puzzles, either. Basically, the challenges are to find items that will unlock other doors in other parts of the ship. You can find keys on dead bodies that will do the trick, but if it's not a key, it's a crowbar. If it's not a crowbar, it's a computer card. If it's not a computer card, it's a blowtorch. Whatever the item, it'll open a door elsewhere in the game. So you're spending all your time wandering the ship to find the door that the item will open. That's pretty much it. The real challenge is to endure the zombie battles in order to grab the keys some of them hold.  It would be silly to expect to be ~scared~ or ~startled~ in this Game Boy Color adventure...the developers do try, though, by having zombies hide in darkened archways. But these archways are really just there to hide zombies, so the surprise is kind of ruined after the first time you find one tucked inside there.  And the game isn't really handheld friendly, either. Players can only save their games to cartridge when they trigger a specific point in the adventure...so if they run out of batteries or have to shut the system off in mid-game, they've lost everything they've done beyond the save point. And save points could be an hour or so apart.  Graphically, the game does push the Game Boy Color hard, with large zombie sprite characters that lumber forward during the ~action~ sequences, and a nifty lighting trick that darkens and lightens the character sprites as they move in and out of the shadows. But in areas where there are three or more zombies in a room...expect a serious amount of slowdown. The stuff that comes out of the Game Boy Color speaker, though...well, it's best that you keep the volume all the way down. The tunes are single note recreations of the Halloween theme song, but using the plinkiest GBC instrument possible. The ~music~ gets awkwardly interrupted by a near-inaudible zombie groan when they approach. Resident Evil Gaiden marks Capcom's completion with Game Boy Color gaming...it's GBA or bust now. Luckily the company also shipped Shantae on the same day as this game, because it would suck to finish off 8-bit development with a game as dull as RE: Gaiden. Don't get me wrong, I totally respect the M4 team for trying its hand at the license...but the game design just doesn't work. It's not fun. The side-story is pretty cool, though, and it'd be a good thing if the game's plot was revisited on a more capable system. Just lose the overhead perspective and the golf-swing battles.
