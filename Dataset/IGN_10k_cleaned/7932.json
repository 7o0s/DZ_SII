Yeah, you fly around and shoot stuff, but that's where the similarities end.  Star Fighter puts you in control of a FedNet Star Fighter, a spaceship with remarkable control, and lets you fly it around a fully rendered 3D world. The landscape changes from mountains to oceans, from houses to high rises. You can even point your nose straight up and head into space. Watching the atmosphere disappear as it changes from blue to black is something only astronauts and Air Force pilots usually get to see, and its breathtaking.  The game's 45 missions are set up like training exercises, designed to let you gradually familiarize yourself with the ship, its weapons, and handling. Your first mission lets you explore the terrain and dock with your mothership, and the subsequent missions let you take out enemies on earth and in space. The ship's control is a little strange at first, as you always barrel roll when turning, but once you've mastered this little hitch you'll be doing loops in no time.  Star Fighter isn't perfect, though. The graphics are chunky, and the draw-in is horrendous. However, this can be overlooked if just for the fact that the landscape is so large and varied. Star Fighter makes just flying around seem fun, and should be commended for it. Nicely done.", "date": "Nov 26, 1996"}
