Usually we get ports of existing games, continuations of console series, or games that have a recognizable license. That's why it was so odd to start reviewing Billy Bob's Huntin' and Fishin', an unlicensed, completely original Game Boy Color game from Midway. Unfortunately, even though it's a title never seen before doesn't mean it's a quality product -- the game's design is as clumsy as the character who stars in it. Features Ten levels Eight mini-games Only for Game Boy Color    The purpose of Billy Bob's Huntin' and Fishin' is to win the heart of your sweetie by giving her what she wants -- she'll ask for three bass or three rabbit (must be a redneck stew recipe or something), and the only way to do this is to go out and fish or hunt. Problem is, you've got to work through the proper chain: get bait, bullets, and your fishing and hunting license. How do you do this? By performing little tasks before actually heading out on the lake or in the woods.  Each of these minigames are extremely simplistic in design, but they're implemented well. They're really nothing more than what you'd get in those simple Game & Watch-style LCD games, but each has to be played in every level in order to advance to the end of the game. For example, to grab bait for fishing you have to play a mini-game where minnows are zipping from one tank to another, and you have to be quick to grab them with your net. To get your fishing license, you have to catch a certain number of cans being rolled out of three vending machines (how this has anything to do with fishing still boggles my mind). To earn bullets for hunting, you must enter a carnival-style shooting range and only hit designated targets with your gun. Both fishing and hunting have four minigames each that must be played through to advance to the actual fishing or hunting games.  You'd think that the Fishing and Hunting portion of Billy Bob's Huntin' and Fishin' would be the reason to actually play this game. Nope -- these two parts are actually the lamest sections. In fishing, you simply find a place on the lake and cast out your reel, and hope that your hook latches onto a fish. Yawn. The hunting portion is a little better, since you actually have to find the place where the animals are hiding -- when you find pawprints, you walk over to them and hit the button that kicks you to the hunting part. Unfortunately, the hunting part is just a rehash of the existing minigame you already played, but this time you can only hit one target. Hit the right animal and you succeed, hit the wrong animal, lose a life and start over.   When all is said and done, Billy Bob's Huntin' and Fishin' really isn't much more than a small compilation of tiny games, and a majority of them just aren't very good. It's not a terrible game, but the whole ~redneck~ atmosphere could be seen as more embarrassing for the player than clever for the designer. Strictly average.", "date": "Dec 4, 1999"}
