In fact, it's been done before on the PC as Dino Park Tycoon. Konami's take on the idea isn't a direct port of that PC game, but it's a close rendition in pocket form, and it would have been a great game if the development team didn't assume that gamers would know what to do right out of the gate. Park Builder has some highs as well lows, but it's mostly good...if you can get through the necessary, but seriously annoying, trial-and-error phase. Features More than 140 species of dinosaur Control every monetary aspect of your park Link cable support to trade DNA sequences Only for Game Boy Advance Park Builder is a fitting game for the license simply because it revolves around the concept of the movie: create an amusement park and make it profitable. Sure, you have full control over what your park looks like -- from foot and bus path directions, to hotel locations, to landscaping. But you need to make sure that what you like is what your customers like, for that's who you're trying to appease. From the second your gates open up, folks will wander your creation and they'll let you know what they like and don't like.   But to keep them entertained, you need dinosaurs. You'll have to excavate for amber, research it for DNA, find the proper DNA sequence to create a dinosaur, and then breed the creature and put him on display for everyone to see. Of course, you'll need to make sure they're fed, healthy, and secure -- you don't want them escaping or dying, that's for sure. All of this costs money, so you'll have to learn to balance the income -- ticket prices, concession stand prices, souvenir prices...every little thing is at your control. Basically, you need to make sure that you're taking in more money than you're spending. Basic economy.  It's a very complex game with tons of little elements to manage...and it's boggling to see that the developers don't offer even the most basic tutorial for beginner park builders. Right from the get-go, you're thrust into the game without knowing what does what, or how you're supposed to do it. The manual isn't much help in telling you how to get started, either I found myself wasting money trying to figure out where hotels can or can't be placed (putting them at the bank of a waterfront or rock face could be fatal since footpaths can't reach them). Luckily, once you're into the game, the computer keeps an eye on what needs to be fixed and altered, alerting you with pull-up windows that can't be ignored even if you tried. So, while it's difficult to get into, once you're past a certain point, it's actually quite easy to play. And it's actually quite pleasing to see your creation thrive, especially when you have tons of patrons telling you how much fun they're having. Hey, it may be virtual, but a compliment is a compliment!  The developers incorporated a very Pokemon-like design element to encourage the use of the link cable between players, and it's a good idea, too -- DNA strands need to be excavated in order to create dinosaurs, and there are five parts to every strand. So, you might go your whole game without finding part four of a certain strand...whereas a buddy might have a couple extra to trade. Through the use of the game link, you can zip a copy of a DNA strand over, and in return, you'd have to give him or her an extra one from your collection. It's only fair. There are 140 different creatures to unlock, so it's in your best interest to find a friend with the game so you can genetically engineer 'em all!  Don't expect to be bowled over by the game's graphics in Park Builder. In fact, they've been designed very similar to Sim ThemePark, with little characters zipping around your park, thought balloons over their heads showing just how happy, sad, or annoyed they are. It's a weird balance -- one of the most complex games on the system has very basic imagery. Ah well, you can't have it all. I was annoyed at the game from the very beginning, due to the fact that I had literally no clue what to do. You see, I'm not one to flip through the manual unless it's absolutely necessary, and in the case of Park Builder, I needed to glance at it more than a few times. The game design really needs a tutorial, since it is very complex with many, many elements to learn...that's Park Builder biggest flaw. But once over that wall, there's a lot to uncover in the game, and designing and managing your own park is a lot of fun. I found myself checking up on my happy patrons so I can get a warm fuzzy seeing how much they like my creation.", "date": "Sep 27, 2001"}
