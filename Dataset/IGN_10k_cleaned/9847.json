When Last Battle debuted alongside the Sega Genesis in August of 1989, it looked like a post-apocalyptic brawler that featured incredible graphics. Of course, visual expectations were still set by the then-popular Nintendo Entertainment System, so seeing the game's hero Aarzak actually stand taller than an inch was enough to blow any 12-year-old's mind and send them rushing to the game counter at Toys R Us.   But time has not exactly been kind to Last Battle. If you have any positive memories hitched to the game, keep them intact by not dusting off that old cartridge. However, sometimes we must indeed torture our darlings, and that's precisely what happens when you follow Aarzak into the Ultimate Savage Land.   Last Battle is actually a localized game based on the manga series Fist of the North Star, which continues to be quite successful in Japan. However, Sega of America knew that both the license and the copious amounts of blood the Japanese game spilled wouldn't work here in the states, so they scrubbed the game clean. In Fist of the North Star, hero Kenshiro (who was renamed the still-bizarre Aarzak) can punch people until they explode in a cloud of vermillion. Aarzak just bats people off-screen. The worst he does is cause an enemy boss to seemingly break out in boils and then pop.      Almost the entire game consists of walking left to right, punching and kicking palette-swapped enemy sprites as they pour into the screen. To say the game grows dull is an understatement. Once the nostalgia wears off, Last Battle tanks. Punching and kicking enemies does manage to slowly fill a power meter along the bottom of the screen. At each threshold in the meter, Aarzak powers up -- which leads to shredding his own shirt under the might of increasingly bulgy muscles. Unfortunately, he loses all of that juice at the end of each level, forcing you to start all over again -- over and over. Ugh.   Last Battle does feature a nice collection of boss battles, also sanitized for American sensibilities. But even if they have been cleaned up a little, they are still just weird. You square off against dudes like a big green wrestler, a little fat man that throws juggling balls, and a pirate cyborg on a tall ship. These boss battles are all about pattern recognition -- aren't they always? -- but the odds still feel stacked against you.   Even though I was enthusiastic about Last Battle when I was a kid, I can still remember loathing the labyrinth levels, which seemed designed to do nothing but make children cry. Room after pointless room full of enemies and randomly thrown axes? Wasn't fun in 1989 and is doubly painful to endure in 2008. However, I still found myself digging the between-stage map screens, which cast Aarzak as a chess piece. You get to choose where you want to fight next, working your way through four map quadrants.  I love my childhood as much as the next guy, but Last Battle is one of those games that shatters the rose-colored glasses. Because I was so excited about getting a Genesis and beating up enemy sprite larger than my pinky, I was sold on Last Battle from the get-go. But playing it now just leaves me with a wry smile -- and the acceptance that that the phrase ~classic~ sometimes refers only to a time period. If you want the punishment, fish it off of eBay and see if you can actually push through the whole thing. Good luck, pal.", "date": "Jan 11, 2008"}
