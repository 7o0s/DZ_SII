The company was founded by staffers who, incidentally, worked with Konami to produce the original Castlevania and Contra games on the NES.   Now the quirky Japanese developer has brought its platform game  expertise to the N64 Mischief Makers, the first 2D  side-scrolling game to appear on Nintendo1' king of 3D game machines.  While the game might not be graphically groundbreaking, it makes up for  this shortcoming with solid level design (though odd at times) and loads  of challenging gameplay.    Mischief Makers stars a robotic cleaning maid named Marina on  a mission to rescue her kidnapped creator from the clutches of an evil  emperor. As with most evil folk, the emperor isn't about to just hand  over the aging scientist, and has amassed an army to stop Marina at all  costs. To reach the emperor and rescue her creator, Marina must make her  way through five different worlds with 12 stages each.    Gameplay is where Mischief Makers really shines. Unlike many  other action/platform titles, the game challenges players to use their  heads to overcome the stages' various obstacles. While some stages focus  on straightforward action, others present the player with puzzle  elements that must be overcome in order to make it to each stages goal.    Marina, your everyday robotic maid, must make her way through a number  of unique (and very 2D) levels on her mission. Levels differ in size and  variety. The first level is very reminiscent of a 16-bit 2D  side-scroller, as Marina walks through the level picking up enemies and  shaking them into dizzy spells, talking to characters and progressing. Actually, it took us quite some time to figure out  the point behind the game, which really doesn't develop until you've  completed the first few levels.    The object of the game, basically, is to capture the star at the end of  each level. In doing so, Marina must shake enemies into dizzy spells,  break path-obstructing blocks, utilize weapons (such as a ball-spouting  shotgun) and ride whatever happens to be in her path (i.e. bikes, wire  mazes, etc.). It's all rather refreshing and can be fun as well as  frustrating.    Graphically, the game isn't going to break any new grounds or amaze many  people. It looks very similar to a 16-bit side-scroller in appearance  (and plays like a good one). The 2D sprites fill the worlds that make up  Marina's quest. Scrolling clouds and backgrounds are nice, but really,  the game isn't nearly as pleasing visually as it is in the gameplay  department. Still, it does sport some nice effects like transparencies  (found in much of the foreground) and anti-alaising, along with  mip-mapping and scaling rotation.    Mischief Makers definitely could of used some work in terms of sound. Seemingly uninspired, the music  is especially bad and often we turned the volume down altogether just  to get away from it. Treasure's latest addition serves as both the first 2D platformer experience on the Nintendo 64 and a solid, well-rounded little game. Mischief Makers does not test the graphic prowess of the 64-bit system and probably won't break any new grounds in terms of 2D adventure platforms, but all the same, it is a welcomed addition for fans of the genre, and certainly Treasure fanatics worldwide will love it.", "date": "Oct 2, 1997"}
