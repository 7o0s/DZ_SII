That's a dead-on description, and if you have even a passing familiarity with either of those games, you know essentially what to expect from WordKing Spelltris. Blocks emblazoned with letters spill into a nine-letter well, and you must create words to clear them away. As letters are removed, more fall from the sky, offering new chances for gamers to prove their mastery of the dictionary.   The larger the created word, the more points it is worth. There are many situations where you feel lucky to squeeze out even a three-letter word and are grateful to take the meager points. If you do find yourself on the receiving end of some tough-as-nails letters, you can employ a bomb to clear the offending letters away -- but you'll sacrifice points to do so. Before resorting to violence, you can spend a second or two to jumble the letters. Looking at a rearranged stack may jog your memory and make you see an opportunity that was once not immediately apparent. And besides, don't be to quick to detonate pesky ~Z~ and ~Q~ letters before trying to drop some extra letters into the well. You can get some nice points for managing to eliminate those less-used letters by making a word.   WordKing Spelltris offers the option to turn the clock off and on, so you can practice without any stress for as long as you want before jumping into a timed match. Or, hey, you never need to turn the timer on if you don't want to -- Spelltris joins an ever-growing league of puzzle games that allow gamers to just enjoy the intellectual challenge of the game without any artificial inducers, like a time limit. (I like a good challenge, but really enjoy this new trend, too -- it's another way to grow the overall mobile audience.) You can log on to DChoc's Mobile League and post your scores -- both timed and untimed -- and compare your prowess to other players.   There is certainly some strategy to WordKing Spelltris, and it's recommended that you play the game without a time limit at first to perfect it. Because you always see the next three letters at the top of the screen, you need to think not only about the current word you can make with the nine letters in the well, but what you could make if one or more of those letters were to fall. Why go for a quickie ~eon~ if you could drop in another ~s~ and spell out ~reasons~ for a handsome bonus? But the catch, of course, is that you have to not use any of the letter needed for the six- or seven-letter words by mistake.    WordKing Spelltris is flanked by a clever medieval theme that riffs on Rapunzel. The more words you create, the faster a knight climbs up a hair rope to a waiting princess in a tower. If you make it to the top, the knight climbs in for a little well-earned amour. And if you can still have letters left after the knight jumps into the tower, a flutter of hearts floating out through the window implies that his performance is enhanced by your ability to spell. Sir Lancelot, indeed.  WordKing Spelltris is a great mobile puzzle game that is sure to entertain wordies, but it deserves a wider audience. Everybody loves Tetris (but, come on, aren't we ready to move on to something else by now?) and by replacing block shapes with letters, DChoc really creates something special. I've logged some considerable time on the game since receiving it last week, and I can imagine anybody that downloads it doing the same. Highly recommended.", "date": "Feb 28, 2006"}
