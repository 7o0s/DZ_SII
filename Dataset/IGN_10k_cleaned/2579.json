Gauntlet came close and NBA Jam is in third, but Blitz always will be number one.   When Blitz was later brought to PlayStation, my friend Pat and I played marathon sessions, staying up until all hours of the morning, hyper and fatted on Mountain Dew and Doritos, glued to our chairs thanks to one simple statement: ~One more game.~ Blitz was the perfect mix of arcade action and football. It was the ultimate head-to-head game, not only because the games were always thrilling and close, but because it was interesting even if you were losing (see: beating the opposing team to a bloody pulp whenever they scored). Above all else, Blitz was fun. Fun enough to inspire sleepless nights. Fun enough to get heavy rotation in the PlayStation for more than a year. Fun enough to make me seriously jones for a next-generation version.   With such a lofty opinion of the original, I was a little skeptical to play the new kid on the block, the enigmatically named NFL Blitz 2002. Compounding my skepticism was the fact that Midway kept this one on a short leash. We hadn't seen much from this title even a month before its arrival, and that's usually a bad sign. But now Blitz 2002 has arrived, and I'll be the first to say that it doesn't disappoint.  Why? Because it's still Blitz. Fans of the series can sigh a huge sigh of relief. Everything that made Blitz exhilirating, addictive and maddening is still here. Midway's added some new features to the gameplay, but they are pretty minor in the grand scheme of things. If you liked the old Blitz, you'll love the new one. Those who perhaps never played Blitz but love games like NBA Street or NHL Hitz, step right up. Those looking for simulation style football, don't look here. Blitz is pure arcade fun, loosely employing the rules of football as a stage for punishing action.   However, the same thing that will bring you relief might eventually bring you consternation. The Blitz formula hasn't changed. In other words, there isn't a whole lot of innovation here. The game is loads prettier than it used to, but it plays almost the same. That's not to say it's a lackluster effort. It isn't. The graphics are beautiful, the control is tight as ever, and there are tons more plays to work with. But you may experience deja vu when playing it. Gameplay As I've already stated a couple of times, Blitz is super-addictive, and that's primarily due to its wide-open, action-oriented gameplay. It's a blend of real football and all-star wrestling. Playing it feels a little like attending a monster truck rally. It's football on both steroids and speed. It's what would happen if we genetically enhanced football players. The great thing about Blitz is that it lives in a world on the boundary of real sport. It doesn't have to pretend to be the most realistic experience in the world, and that's refreshing. It doesn't have to brag about its AI or talk about its franchise mode. But it does have to be fun.   By that measure, it delivers. Blitz is the kind of game that invokes a lot of friendly smack talk, a lot of cursing, and a good deal of joy as well. Most of this is due to the fact that the game can change at any moment. The ball takes some crazy bounces when rules are thrown out the window. In Blitz, there is no pass interference, no late hits, no illegal motion. You can't be offsides if you try. To get a first down, you have to go 30 yards. If you do manage to get into the end zone, you go either go for two or automatically kick an extra point. Everything about Blitz is designed to speed up the game of football, and it's a brilliant formula.   Another key feature is that you can pass as many times as you want behind the line of scrimmage before chucking it downfield. Not only is this fun to play around with, it figures heavily into strategy the more you play a given opponent. As with the original, 2002's control scheme is rudimentary but solid. It has immediate pick-up-and-play value, but gets deeper as you play more. That's a sign of a good game. If if you are still discovering subtle nuances in gameplay after you've played a few dozen games, as you do in Blitz, you know you have a winner on your hands. This year's edition adds a couple of new wrinkles that are worthy of note.  Try running up the middle, and you'll be hurting.  Midway has added an ~Impact Player~ feature that enables you extra control over a specific player on your team. Set him to Protect or Go Deep, or just have him hang out near your quarterback to grab a Dish if your QB gets in trouble. You don't have to use the Impact Player feature to enjoy the game, but it provides another layer of control, which is definitely welcome. Also added to this year's edition is the ability to call audibles.     The playbooks have been expanded as well. Every team has a standard stable of plays, and these are broken down into formations, which are further split into different pages. The formation/page scheme isn't very intuitive at first, which was pretty frustrating. But once you discover how to navigate it, you'll notice a ton of extra plays. All of the original Blitz plays are here under the header Old School. There's the old standby ~Da Bomb,~ and the ever-popular ~QB Post.~   In addition to those are several more formations. My favorite is Sandlot, which incorporates all the kooky plays you tried to pull on the playground as a kid. Each individual team has its own slate of plays, which is really only one extra page. I had hoped there would be a little more variation among teams. Since the game is so wide open, it usually matters little which team you choose, competition-wise. Vastly different playbooks would help to set squads apart. But alas, this is not the case. Each team gets a page of specialized offensive plays, and that's it. Every team has the same defensive choices.   As always, the passing game is fun and dynamic. It's awesome to toss a 60-yard pass, see it knock around between a couple of defenders and land in the waiting arms of your receiver (who's then promptly stapled to the turf). It's fun to pass a couple times behind the line of scrimmage before heaving the ball to your wide open receiver. It's fulfilling to throw a pass back to your quarterback. And it's easy to get the hang of. If you don't want to use the old school ~point to a receiver and throw~ mechanics, you can use icon passing. Both work well.  What doesn't work well is rushing, even though there was supposed to be a greater emphasis placed on the running game in 2002.  You still can't run effectively through the line. You still can't hand the ball directly off. All of the running is handled by pitching the ball out wide or running reverse-type plays. It all feels curiously like passing. They've made it easier to see which plays are meant to be runs by color coding the plays, but it won't make all that much difference, as you probably won't be using them.  The number of game modes is also lacking. Midway's hockey offering, NHL Hitz 2002, had a lot of different ways to play and customization features. There was a cool training mode that offered challenges for your player to complete. As you improved, you could continue taking the challenges and setting high scores. There is nothing like that in Blitz. Nor is there a Create Player or Create Team function. In Hitz, it was awesome to take a team of created players through an NHL season as the Fargo Sloths or New Orleans Voodoo. There is no such functionality in Blitz.  In fact, the only game modes offered are Quick Play, Exhibition, Season or Tournament. Quick Play and Exhibition are basically the same. Tournament allows a group of players to compete in a bracket-style throwdown. And Season lets you take your football team through a full regular season schedule in a quest for the Lombardi trophy. These are all great, but there are a couple of things missing. In the old Blitz, the game kept track of the NFL teams you had beaten in a long list. Most of the single-player fun to be had in that version of the game involved working your way through the list trying to beat every team. There is no such thing here, and there should be. It could be called Old School Mode.   A Fantasy Challenge would have been nice, too. Midway sports games have always had great fantasy characters (remember wolfman from NBA Showtime and all of the cool Hitz teams?). Why not have a mode where you can take on the Frankensteins or Frogmen? If Madden can have crazy made-up teams, and it's basically a sim, why can't Blitz? Sure, there are codes you can enter to unlock stuff, but it would be much more rewarding if you earned the right to play a kooky team by completing a challenge in the game. Or, even better, unlock a made-up team by beating it in Fantasy Mode. Player detail and grass detail is nice at 60 fps.  The reason the lack of modes is frustrating is because Blitz is a good game. You want to play it. But it's basically an old idea, so in order for you to want to play it again and again, there have to be new and better things to unlock or collect. New plays and impact players aside, there aren't enough brand new innovations in this game to carry it without a little more meat. As a multiplayer experience, NFL Blitz 2002 is great. But as a single player game, it needs more oomph.   Graphics The challenge with an arcade-style sports game is presenting a pumped-up take on the look and feel of football while staying true to the original. Midway does this extremely well. The player models are beefy but not out of control. The stadiums are raucous and populated but not distracting. The effects aren't overdone. Basically, NFL Blitz 2002 is nice to look at.   The player models look exceptionally good and set the tempo for the rest of the graphics. Like NFL Fever, a ton of detail went into every inch of every player. Arms have veins and the mesh on the jerseys look almost real. Musclulature is exagerrated but not offensively so. And where the original Blitz sported only a couple different sizes of players, this one has a lot of variation. Gilbert Brown has a whopping gut, but Jevon Kearse is a sleek sacking machine. Warrick Dunn is nowhere near as large as Ted Washington. While this attention to detail may not have been necessary since (sarcasm ahead) this is only an arcade style football game, but it's a sign of craftsmanship. The faces are about the only area of the character models that could have been improved. Otherwise, they're butta.   This excellence continues in player animation. Since this is a hyped-up version of football, you expect some pretty outrageous animations, and you get 'em. The foundation for the great animation comes from motion capture. For the athletic stuff, the Oakland Raiders' Charles Woodson (also the game's cover boy), lent his Heisman stylings. For everything else, a team of professionals did everything from pile drivers to lunging tackles. The result is a bunch of hard-hitting, over-the-top, often hysterical aerial maneuvers. The animations are larger than life, but they look slick and flow well. This is a tall order, too, because most of the time bodies are hurtling through the air when they interact. But it all comes off smoothly, and looks great. So great, in fact, that you forget about things like animation altogether and focus instead on atomic dropping your opponent out of bounds.   The fields and stadia look nice as well. You wouldn't expect a game like Blitz to have such nice textures, but the field is beautifully rendered. The grass actually looks like grass, and the turf like turf. The arenas are fairly true to their real-life form as well. The only thing I wanted to see was more populated sidelines. It would be cool if you could knock a player into the Gatorade table, or plow through an opposing team's coaching staff or resting defense. In fact, I'd say it would be righteous if you could body slam Bill Cowher or pimp slap Dave Campo. At the very least, you should be able to break the water boy over your knee. Of course, all of that extra sideline stuff would probably slow the game down, and we don't want that. As is, it moves pretty fluidly, and that's important with such fast-paced action.   The only real graphic flaw is a bit of clipping. On replays you can see players' hands phasing right through other guys. When helmets collide, they merge. You can't see any of this while the game is running full-speed, but graphics snobs will notice it on replays.  Sound Blitz has always had a distinctive sound. From the robust, testosterone-filled announcer to the abrasive sounds of men beating each other silly, from the unique sound of a pass being dropped to the thunderous thud of a body-slam, you can always tell when Blitz is being played nearby. The aural tradition continues with 2002.   All of the over-the-top sound effects that accompanied previous versions of the game have been stuffed into this one. There are the howitzer-like hit sounds, the wonderfully understated effects of a dropped pass or missed field goal, and the spirit-crushing noises that occur when you squander an opportunity and turn the ball over on downs. All of the effects employed help to set the emotional tone for the game, and work quite well as they are intended. When you hear that plink sound as your game-winning field goal caroms off of the upright, you may want to throw your GameCube across the room. It's like the game is taunting you, and that's a good thing... Blitz forces you to want to play it again, just to prove something.  Plenty of plays to choose from.  In addition to the old standbys, there are new and unique sounds, including a lot of jawing between players, and a good deal of subtle stuff that happens after the play. For instance, after a player is driven into the turf, you might hear him squeak ~that hurt,~ or just let out a plaintive moan. Blitz's sound is good because it gets the little things right. Another cool new touch happens during replays. If your player jumps, that wicked sound effect from the Bionic Man plays. How cool is that?   The voice of Blitz is back as well, and he's got a buddy in the booth. The two game announcers combine to provide about a game's worth of interesting commentary. After that, you'll tune it out. Most of the color work sounds like a bad attempt at imitating EA's NHL 2002 announcer, which was so wonderful and wacky and random that no one should try to duplicate it. And hearing the announcer's booming, familiar voice only goes so far. It's nostalgic for awhile, then blends into the background. Overall, NFL Blitz 20-02 is a must-own for any fan of the original series. This is a huge upgrade in the graphics department, and the gameplay is solid as ever. It doesn't do much more than the original game, and is a little short on single player fun. For pure, arcade-style football action, there's nowhere else to be.", "date": "Mar 26, 2002"}
