Star Wars Jedi Starfighter is based on the newest of the Star Wars moves, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and it's the sequel to the massive-scale Star Wars Starfighter, one of the better LucasArts works on the consoles.    Jedi Starfighter sends players into the Star Wars universe and into a story that follows the movie in some respects and drifts into creative territory specific to the game, winding up tied into the movie's ending. It looks, feels, plays and sounds very much like its predecessor, which, while not surprising, is a little bit of a letdown. The even mix of land and space battles, having returned from the first game, require players to manage various foes simultaneously and refine their timing and accuracy. And while the culmination of this year's effort is an excellent, respectable game, it's also the exact same game design that we received last year.    Even with the great new additions, Jedi Starfighter isn't as novel or as fresh as the first and the second time around most gamers' expectations are higher, not lower. Yes, I had fun playing it, but a singular, repetitive kind of fun, one that only surprised me twice. The excellent reward system almost makes up for strange feeling of deja vu, and the two-player mini-games are more polished than last year, but you still won't find anything terribly new in Jedi Starfighter.   Gameplay  In this new endeavor, players get to grips with two main characters, Jedi Master Adi Gallia and alien space pirate Nym. The story takes place during the movie, after the Trade Federation has been defeated at Naboo. Things are unsettled in the universe. The secessionist movement grows in power after Count Dooku and Captain Cavik Toth secretly join forces. Though they aren't sure what's going on, Mace Windu and the Jedi Council sense trouble. So the Jedi Council sends Master Jedi Adi Gallia (in a slick new prototype starfighter) to ally with Nym, who is the only force so far to resist Toth and his cronies. After Adi demonstrates her good intent, the two combine forces to thwart the trade Federation.   Bringing the game back to basics a little, LucasArts has chosen only two ships for players to pilot, Adi's new Force-powered Jedi Starfighter and Nym's bomber. The game doesn't lose much with the loss the female fighter Vana Sage (the third usable ship in the first Starfighter), and as players switch between Nym's slower bomber and Adi's lithe, speedy craft, the ability to become a better pilot using each ship grows stronger. As I played, though, I found that I wanted to play the Starfighter craft more, due to its incredible speed and maneuverability.   For those who haven't played the first Starfighter, Jedi Starfighter handles similarly. Players attack with primary and secondary controls. There is access to wingmen (which actually make a difference this time around), thrust, stall, spin, and two perspectives, first and third-person perspective. The newly added functions in Adi's Starfighter are the big bonus this time around, and these functions, appearing on the Dpad, serve as the secondary fire. The new prototype, you see, enables Master Jedi members to channel their abilities through the ship itself into four manifest forms. Players can create a protective Force Shield, attack smaller clusters of ships with Force Lighting, slow down time with Force Reflex, or blast numerous enemies with a wave ranging Force Shock Wave.    As you progress through the game, you'll learn that Adi's ship is weaker without the Force powers, but in conjunction with them and sprinkled with timing and skill, she's much more powerful. The Force attacks didn't seem as magical as I expected them to, but over time, I learned to master the bigger attacks, and felt that their additions make for a better game. Mastering the timing of Force attacks is also crucial to succeeding, mostly in later levels. Players achieve a sense of ~oneness~ with the Force, meaning that by pressing the Circle button down for a precise amount of time, they'll achieve more powerful attacks. It's somewhat annoying at first, and becomes bearable later on, but it's crucial to learn for boss fights and in the last levels.   Returning down to wing for a moment, Nym's ship felt very familiar to the first: large, slow, and cumbersome. Much of the time I felt that I was required to play too much of Nym's craft, when all I wanted to do was zip around in Adi's. But as I learned, Nym's ship is incredibly powerful and I grew to bathe in its strengthes. Just like in the first game, players use their wingmen to attack, protect, check in or protect a specific target, and in the second to last level, players will find that using a monstrous space cannon can be oh-so-much fun (while in Nym's bomber). Yes, the wingmen are actually used for something! Also, the variety of Nym's bombs, including Energy, Cruise, Proximity, and Cluster, provide a fantastic array of attacks.    The bulk of the game is designed with missions that feel very familiar to those in the original Starfighter, which is disappointing. In the 14-plus levels, the land missions and air battles round out to about 50-50, and while the locales, enemies, and mission objectives are all new and different, the gameplay is exactly the same as in Starfighter. You're attacked and you fend off the throng of enemy Droid fighters. You must defend your ally while attacking numerous waves of Freighters and Sabaoth Fighters. Blow up their base. Defend your base. Attack that. Defend this.  Etc., etc. Why doesn't this game branch out from this safe, already well-defined formula? There are only a precious few missions that feel as if they're doing something different, bu tit's not enough. But there is more. Why isn't there a new way to use the killer zoom function in a better way? Why don't the Force Attacks feel like you're using the Force? They just feel like regular old attacks.       The questions continue. Why does the ninth level of this game feel like a combination of the final level of Starfighter and the final level in Rogue Squadron? You know, enter into the Trade Federation mother ship, chase down the Bounty Hunter, and then blast out of there, only this time, you also have to knock a few bombs perfectly down a shaft to blow up the core reactor. Sound familiar?    The timing of the game's release seems odd, too. Usually, games release near the same time as the movie of the same name. Here, Jedi is out two months before the movie, with no synchronicity working at all. The climactic Clone battle here is entirely forgettable, totally anti-dramatic, and why? Because it's not put into the bigger context of the movie. There's no doubt that the game should stand on its own two feet, but if I missed the importance of this huge battle that's important to the game -- and the movie -- then it didn't work too well. Either that, or it's a scene that's just not that important to the game.   My frustration with Jedi Starfighter is that only after the ninth level, when the learning curve jumped up about five notches (which was an eye-opening development on its own), did I have to pay attention to what I was doing. Up until then I was on cruise control. Up until then, it was all run-of-mill. Then, Bam! Just like in the original Starfigher do things start cooking. Although Jedi Starfighter does indeed grow only a little bit deeper than its predecessor, the main focus of the designers seems to be to broaden it -- to make it more accessible to casual gamers. Thus, instead of more innovative gameplay, we have more casual gamer friendly items. That's not a bad thing, but hardcore gamers, experienced in gaming space combat, will find that there is very little new to experience, and they may grow bored quickly.    I do have to say, when it comes to extras, this game is packed fat with rewards. Broken down into two main modes, Story mode and Bonus Features, Jedi Starfighter enables players to blast though the core game, and with good scores (divided into Basic, Bonus and the new Secret Objectives), an array of extras come into play. The Bonus Features mode jam packs 30 different rewards for gamers to try out after they succeed in attaining Bonus and Secret Objectives in Story Mode.    For instance, in one- and two-player modes, players can replay different levels with new objectives. There are almost 10 Bonus Craft to be opened, including TIE Fighters, the Advanced Freefall craft, Advanced Havoc craft, an X-Wing, Advanced Zoomer, Advanced Jedi Starfighter, the Sabaoth Fighter, Republic Gunship, and finally, Slave 1. The Bonus Material is even more fatty, with special footage of a new game (Star Wars Bounty Hunter), movie concept art, movie outtakes and team commentary to name a few. Wow, now that's come incentive. And it's rewarding as hell, even if the tasks themselves become tedious.    It's also important to point out that Jedi Starfighter has modestly fixed the framerate and the weird bouncing effects, though they're still not perfect (the framerate drops every so often, and the bouncing effect is there, just not as jarring). So, in a way, while we don't get the innovation and creativity that I was hoping for, the game is a fatter, slightly more honed title than its predecessor. And let's admit, Thank God for the cool new Episode II ships. Those old gold crafts from Episode I were just nasty.      Graphics  For those who didn't play Starfighter, the best visual aspects of the game are the exact same ones that are good looing in this one. The fantastic size of the locales and the reach of the play envelope in which you can fly is enormous, something I still enjoy after five years of shrouded, fogged-in, small PlayStation games. The whole set of new craft, based on the new Episode II movie, are simply better looking, cooler looking, and while a little more traditional in terms of futuristic space craft, they're still better in all respects to look at and fly.    Players will experience a good set of CG cut-scenes slipped into between Acts I, II and III, and these are good, respectable scenes, though I have the feeling they're not quite as good as the movie is going to look. The in-game cutscenes actually do the trick a little better, relaying a smoother transition between story and actual gameplay.    What really comes to mind when pinpointing the best aspects of the game's graphics are the use of light, transparencies and particles, all aspects that are core to PlayStation 2's strengths. When you destroy a frigate or a massive Dropship, the sense of power and destruction is impressive, and it brings with it a huge sense of satisfaction. The polygons disperse into flying chunks, the spray of light and bits is awesome, while the remaining dust leaves one feeling like they have truly made a difference in the world of polygonal mayhem.   Also, if my eyes haven't failed me, the many craft and the terrain all have slightly been reworked for a little more detail. Ships appear highly more decked out, and each locale seems populated with a little more stuff.    Sound  The Star Wars Starfighter series, as with so many Star Wars games, pushes gamers to listen. There is a ton of Star Wars diction and important dialog to pay attention to in Jedi Starfighter that's absolutely necessary to succeed. The voice-acting once again focuses on the wacky, slightly humorous, and often predictable conversations between Nym, Retti, Adi, their allies, and their enemies. Thinking back a bit, the conversations in Starfighter and Jedi Starfighter are disturbing echoes of past Star Wars dialogues, reincarnating the chummy, bickering spats between Han Solo and Princess Leia, C-3PO and R2D2, or Luke and Han, only in different situations with new, less charming characters.    The game's whole sense of sound is framed by the classic Star Wars soundtrack. With additions that range through the classical soundtrack itself to quiet string-plucking times of solitude and introspection to dramatic, over-the-top action sequences that pack a whopping punch. If you like Star Wars music, then you'll be mildly amused by this. It is good music that's nicely organized and always works well with the gameplay itself. Star Wars Jedi Starfighter didn't impress me as much as the first one, but perhaps that's because the PlayStation 2 is one and half years into its lifespan, and with last year's incredible outburst of outstanding titles, it's hard to impress anyone these days. I definitely feel that the Force powers add another layer to the game's depth, but with the lack of level variety, no new innovations, and the same game design repeated almost to a T, Jedi feels far too familiar. Where this game shines is in its extras. Players can get to grips with as many as 30 extra little items, from exclusive artwork to team commentary to piloting Slave 1. Yes! It's important to note that the two-player co-op mode is a blast to play, as are the extra mini-games. So, if you loved the first, then you'll love this just as much, because it's very much the same. But if you were bored with the original Starfighter, then definitely rent this first.", "date": "Mar 11, 2002"}
