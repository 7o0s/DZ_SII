Sure, you may not have the urge to buy an old car and trick it out with hundreds of thousands of dollars in upgrades so you can then enter it in a competition and bash the bejeezus out of it, but now there's a rough simulation of it. Jaleco's Lowrider brings the world of bouncing, transforming cars to the PS2 and maybe, just maybe, we're all a little better off for it.   Lowrider is a minigame of a larger game that doesn't exist. The gameplay is little more than upgrading a car and then bouncing it along to glory. A pretty minimal excuse for a game, but it is still the only lowrider game out there and for that it deserves at least some attention.   Gameplay  There are a few different competitions in Lowrider that earn money in order to customize your ride to do even better in more competitions. These are the Hop, the Dance, and the Event. Hop rewards the biggest front hop within a minute, Dance has a variety of different jumping contests with one other car, and Event has a Dance event with three to five other cars.    Winning these competitions require a minimum of rhythmic ability because it's really all about the car modifications. There are the upgrades that improve the hopping ability of your car with better suspension, hydraulics, and batteries. The more you spend, the bigger the bounce.    Other modifications are all about the style. The roof can be dropped, a skirt can be added on the side, a dozen colors can be picked for the car, there are twenty murals to choose for the side and over forty to choose for the hood and the trunk. Pretty quickly, my beater became a world class pimpin' and stylin' automobile.   Taking it even further, I was also able to upgrade the front and back of the car to start doing tricks on their own. The hood could then lift up and spin around as could the rear end. To top it off, extra effects like smoke or balloons or even doves can be added for extra punch.    All in all, I had some sweet wheels to bump around with and in later competitions, my car got so jacked that I could start doing the crazier tricks. I was able to jump the front end so high that I balanced on my rear wheels and fender. I could also rock side to side so hard that I rolled over entirely. Pretty soon, I swept through all the competitions.   Beyond that appeal, though, there was nothing left. There are no other cars to purchase to trick out and fill up a garage with and I was stuck just putting different paint jobs on the same car. When I won the last competition, nothing happened. By that I mean that the game didn't even recognize my victory. It said that I won, but still listed the last event as incomplete. Somewhere along the way, the developers forgot to finish this game and published what they had.   Graphics  The crowds in the competitions are made up of just a few different 2D drawings that get repeated endlessly. As the camera pans across the meager crowd, I spotted the same red-shirted guy at least ten times. The rest of the environments fared slightly better with some blocky backgrounds and street textures that are badly compressed gray blobs.   The cars are well-done and it was a blast to see them hop around and transform with the more extensive modifications. On the other hand, the extra special modifications like the balloons and smoke are done so badly it hurts. One that did make me bust out laughing was a Statue of Liberty balloon head that came out of a trunk. Nothing screams pleasing the crowd like a distorted green head.    Sound  There's one song in here and it's played over and over behind a few different hoots and hollers. It's clear that the cars are the stars of the show here and they received the only attention with some realistic crunching, crashing, and hydraulic sound effects.Lowrider is a funky minigame that somehow became a game in and of itself. Tacked onto another racing title, it would've made sense, but this is one of the weakest excuses for a game ever. If you can find it for $10 or less, I'd recommend picking it up for a good laugh, but beyond that it's better left forgotten.", "date": "Nov 25, 2003"}
