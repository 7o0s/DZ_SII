We're absolutely hooked on Warcraft. We play it before work, after work, and all weekend. We check the auction house as soon as we wake up. Whenever we have time for a stray thought, it's about an unfinished quest, or where to get another 4000 gold to buy an epic flying mount, or what an amazing shield that Tauren we grouped with yesterday had. It utterly consumes us. Like smoking, we're fully aware it's not very good for us, and there are far better ways to pass an idle moment, but boy, is it compelling. Do feel free to substitute 'smoking' with 'mainlining smack' or 'talking about Celebrity Big Brother', as relevant. Like any of those, we don't even know for sure if we're even enjoying the experience all the time, but when we do, we really enjoy it.    In fact, The Burning Crusade provides some very, very strong arguments for falling off the wagon and into its welcoming online arms. Almost everything it adds, especially for players who've already maxed out the levelling up in WoW, is better than in the original. The new areas look more detailed and more fantastic that any of the old ones. The technology behind the game's graphics may be old and simple, but the bright colours and comic book proportions of everything means it can still look absolutely stunning. Most of all, it's full of imagination - there are forests of giant toadstools, pipes of magic energy linking floating islands together, dragons circling a citadel on a cliff and even a gnome cloning lab hidden in the mountains.   Even if you can't really do anything more in each of these areas than kill things and collect other things, it's exciting just to be in them. There's always some new mad beastie to fight, or some pocket of NPCs with jokey names (a goblin named Action Jaxon, for instance), or a towering construct to try and find a way into, and invariably get immediately killed in. The actual game may not have moved on particularly, but looking so good is almost enough of a substitute.    For so much of the original WoW, levelling up was something you chased purely to become more powerful. In this, levelling up is also something you do so that you can find out what wonders the next area has. You're also immediately rewarded for having made it this far. The improvements to armour and weapons, once you step through the Dark Portal to the new planet Outland, are amazing. All that epic purple gear that long-time players spent months grinding dungeons over and over again for starts looking pretty pokey quite quickly. A green drop from a level 62 vulture can make a mockery of anything from the original WoW - even more so once socketed items (for people who use jewelcrafting, the new tradeskill, to add extra bonuses to) come into play at the later levels.    Of course, the mobs become increasingly strong too in Outland. No matter how much mega-loot you collect, you'll never feel like some superpowered destroyer of worlds unless you head back to earlier zones and kill low-level monsters in a single hit. We did try that for kicks, but it felt a bit like beating up schoolchildren. It's not big, it's not clever, and most of all we don't get any experience points for it. Still, if there's one thing that's going to make it impossible for any even slightly committed player to keep playing WoW without buying TBC, it's seeing other players wearing gear with really big numbers attached.     All the ability boosts in the world can't disguise the fact that you'll still spend a lot of time hitting the same number keys over and over again to kill infinitely-respawning animals. Where Outland is less awesome is where WoW itself is less awesome. There're some truly great quests to be found, but too often the game takes the easy option. Killing a set number of animals may well win some experience points, a cash or item reward and a text-based slap on the back from an NPC, but it's something every WoW player has done hundreds of times already. Because of the business of the servers, there's invariably dozens of other players trying to do the same quest, which totally kills any belief that you're a real hero - wait a few weeks before you start playing TBC and you might enjoy it more.   If Outland didn't look so incredible, the uninspired quests would have made it so much less appealing. It would have been great if this add-on expanded the scope as well as the size of the game - player-owned houses and businesses, for instance. Then again, this is a game that's as popular as it is (there will have been several thousand new subscribers during the time it took you to read this review) because it's so accessible. Stick something much more complicated than killing monsters in there and the whole thing could collapse.    What's definitely improved is the dungeons. While previously they felt very much apart from the rest of the game, partly because they took so long to do, now they're quick, intense challenges that can be done for fun as much as they can for tracking down the best loot. There's even a very rough storyline running through them, building up to defeating Illidan, the self-proclaimed Lord of Outland, once you reach level 70. Also open at last are the Caverns of Time in Tanaris, which do really push the dungeon formula. They're a collection of super-quests that take you and your party to outdoor recreation of WoW zones as they appeared at earlier points in Warcraft's extensive history.   Arranging an Orc prison break or fighting off an army who mean to destroy time itself is massively exciting, but unfortunately to get to the third dungeon wing you'll need to have put in an inhuman amount of hours. Only a select, some would say almost insane, few will ever see it, which is a bit of a shame. Then again, it's a nod to those people who put every spare minute they have into WoW, as in most other respects TBC is designed to be more rewarding for players who can only give it a few hours a week. There's certainly still room to be hardcore, but the way the dungeons and the PvP have been designed is obviously so that anyone can now enjoy almost every aspect of the game.    Also accessible to anyone who buys TBC are two new playable races. It's exciting to have the option to play as a Dranei (a sort of sex-goat) or Blood Elf (basically, Aryan Night Elfs), but in practice they don't really bring any new treats to the never-ending Warcraft party. They do look great, if maybe lacking the sheer personality an undead or a gnome has, but because they share the same class types as the existing races, they don't offer much else to do. There're about 20 levels of new quests (again, some of which are much more enjoyable than most of the original WoW's), but after that you'll see the same sights, quests and bad-tempered Owlbeasts as before.   Even if you can't bear to repeat all that low-level pottering about yourself, the new races definitely add to the game. The first few Dranei and Blood Elves are starting to appear in the high level areas (we try not to think about the ravaged minds and bodies of the players who took them so far so fast), and just having those extra faces around makes WoW feel somehow more alive.   Admittedly, the sheer number of people who've jumped on board to try out The Burning Crusade has taken its toll somewhat on the European servers but, thankfully, the occassional flashes of bad lag are nothing in comparison to the massive server queues we saw in the early days of World of Warcraft. The few-second pauses that strike the game once in a while, usually while looting or performing similar activities, are annoying but understandable given the vast size the WoW database has reached, thanks to the new players and items dancing around now. Still, it's not ideal and hopefully Blizzard will get around to tackling the issue sooner rather than later.Only two weeks in, and it's now very difficult to remember what World of Warcraft was like without The Burning Crusade. It's a seamless fit with what's gone before, and yet its big design ideas also make the game's universe feel much more its own thing. It's by no means Another Fantasy MMO anymore. It doesn't need to steal from Lord of the Rings and Warhammer anymore. It's Warcraft, and, as is obvious by the titanic number of people playing TBC, it can set its own rules now. TBC is a vital buy for any WoW player, and cooly cements its place as the best mainstream MMO there is. Next expansion though, we want to see more sweeping changes.", "date": "Jan 26, 2007"}
