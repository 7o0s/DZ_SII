It's a rivalry that has gone unchallenged for too long. InLight Entertainment has finally brought the fight to the Nintendo DS with Teenage Zombies: Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingys. It's not a mindless action gore fest like you might expect from the violent opening cutscenes. Rather, it's a slower-paced puzzle-oriented platformer. It's pretty good, but with a game starring both aliens and zombies, the gameplay doesn't live up to the premise.   Brains have attacked Earth! And by ~brains~ we don't mean hoards of nerds that have finally risen up against their oppressors (mostly jocks.) We mean actual malevolent gray matter, equipped with lasers and mind control devices. Seems the only way to not be killed by the evil brains... is to already be dead. Enter the Teenage Zombies, three undead youths that have risen from their graves. Humanity's undefeatable nemesis is the zombie's all-you-can-eat alien buffet.    The game stars three rotting corpses: Lori ~Lefty~ Lopez, Finnigan ~Fins~ Magee and Zack ~Half-Pipe~ Boyd. Each zombie brings a different skill to the group that helps the trio feast on delicious brain meats. Lefty, a former basketball team member, has a long reach that can be used to reach ledges. Half-Pipe is missing his lower body, so wheels around on his skateboard. He can roll through tight areas and launch off ramps. Fins, a chubby swimming enthusiast, mutated while he was buried and now has tentacles growing out of his back. He can use these to climb walls and grapple along wires. Each member of the bizarre team is useful (even the fat one) and players switch between them to complete the levels.   The entire game has a very comic book feel, and the developers have presented the story in a comic book format. During the cutscenes players flip the DS ~book style~ to read about the misadventures of the ex-teenagers. The story is usually focused on the game's main villain, the Big Brain. The writing is well done and humorous throughout and the few times the game features voice work are fun. It has a darkly humorous, but cartoony feel, similar to Invader Zim or The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. The game starts off like any alien invasion story should: with a lot of violence. People get holes blasted through them, dogs are disintegrated and to cap it all off, the undead burst from their graves, hungry for cerebellum.   Braaaaains are not often needed for the puzzles. After watching innocent people get murdered and given a goal of destroying an entire alien army, it seems a little strange that the game is not more action-based. Though the game has a lot of platforming elements, it's mostly an elaborate puzzle game. Most of the work is figuring out which zombie to control and when to work through the levels. There is a bit of action, especially with all the aliens hovering around, but most of it is still in a puzzle setting. If you see a whole grip of alien brains, chances are there's a powerup or other way to get rid of them without having to charge them head-on.   The puzzles aren't going to hurt your brainmeats. It's usually pretty obvious who to use and when, since the game is mostly pretty linear. Towards the end of the game there are a few spots where a misstep will mean getting lasered to death (re-death?), especially if played on hard mode.   By nature of their undeadness, zombies are pretty slow. And as a result, the game is pretty slow. Sometimes it just seems to take forever for the on screen zombie to shuffle his way across the level. There are 33 chapters spanning across seven different worlds, and each one is pretty short, but they feel longer than they ought to be. In a way it kind of helps the longevity of the game since it's not a game that really stays enjoyable in large doses.   The game contrasts with the story presentation. The cut scenes are very cartoony, wacky and violent, but the game itself is dull by comparison. There are only a few sound effects and the levels are bland. We did really like the comic book panels that are actually used as platforms within the game, and the powerups were humorous (Fins' involves puking). The gameplay is fine and manages to be pretty fun, but the whole appeal of ~zombies vs aliens~ just doesn't get translated to it in the process. Nearly every enemy goes down with one hit and we just got really sick of seeing the same bad guys over and over, like those dumb rats in every level.   Occasionally during the adventure players will come across a touch screen minigame. They're purely for bonus point purposes, but serve as action respites from the puzzle portions of the game. The minigames are hit or miss, as minigames tend to be. Some of them are fun and well done, and even manage to be more fun than some of the core gameplay. Others are hard to control bores, which just reinforces the whole feeling of contrasting quality within the game. Plus, it'd be nice if they served a real purpose.I want to like Teenage Zombies: Invasion of the Alien Brain Thingys more. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game as it is, but it just seems like it should have been so much more. After the voice-acted story at the beginning and a fun and interesting premise, we wanted the game to be equally funny and engaging. The gameplay is fun enough, but it contrasts with what the game presents itself to be. It offers some decent puzzle platforming, though the game never becomes very challenging. The touch screen minigames are hit or miss and the game actually isn't very long. Teenage Zombies is not a bad game at all, it's just hard to recommend it.", "date": "Apr 16, 2008"}
