Clyde joins a number of other oddball games on the XBLA like Wik and Outpost Kaloki X, but it's also offers some of the most extensive game modes available. It's also a lot of fun to play. At 800 Microsoft Points (10 dollars USD), it's one of the more expensive options. Still, it's still cheaper than Bankshot Billards, which stands as the most confoundingly overpriced XBLA title to date at 1200 MPs (15 dollars USD).   Developed by Ninja Bee, the folks responsible for Outpost Kaloki X, Cloning Clyde is a side scrolling puzzle-platformer in the vein of something like Lemmings or The Lost Vikings. Its gameplay is simpler than those titles, but it's still entertaining. Clyde, a total moron, is unwittingly roped into a genetic experiment with the promise of a 20 dollar reward. However, the tests go awry and Clyde winds up getting himself cloned innumerable times. Each level plays on the fact that Clyde can replicate himself, challenging players to switch between clones to solve puzzles, collect power ups, and destroy enemies.    The game offers 24 levels in addition to a few training stages, as well as 10 challenge stages once the rest are completed. Completing each stage requires players to use a range of silly gameplay devices. By using The Fly-like genetic mashing machines, Clyde can turn into creatures like a goat, a monkey, a frog, an explosive barrel, or a chicken. Each form gives Clyde special powers like flying, swimming, exploding, jumping, and ceiling crawling. In addition, Clyde can toss around chickens and ride goats to overcome obstacles.   Then there are the human Clyde clones, who can be switched between at will. Sometimes there'll be around 20 Clydes in one level. To open doors or disengage electricity fields, each Clyde often needs to be placed on switches or scales or other such mechanisms. Particularly cool are the rockets scattered around some levels. When Clyde jumps into their path, they slam into his stomach, carrying him across otherwise impassable chasms. In some of the later levels the rocket puzzles get pretty crazy.   Clyde's main goal in each stage is to reach the exit. To make it appear, he needs to destroy security bots. Destroying the bots and kung-fu-ing explosive chickens completes the stage and reveals the exit. Beyond that, floating toy action figures can be collected, DNA strands can be nabbed to power up super moves, and the Clyde clones in the stage can be rescued. After all the security bots are blown up, players are treated to tinny jazz music and the removal of grates from a number of pipes around the stage. Guiding all the extra Clydes through the pipes rescues them. The final Clyde can be maneuvered to the exit to complete the stage and receive a score.   While puzzle designs are varied throughout the game, it can get tiresome at points. Guiding 19 frog Clydes to an exit, for instance, doesn't verge on exciting. Thankfully, that's necessary only if you want the bonus points. Otherwise, the stages can be sped through fairly rapidly. Once players understand how the various game mechanics work, Cloning Clyde isn't a very complicated game. Yet, as it proceeds towards the finish, it's still fun.    Once the single player content is exhausted, there's still cooperative and online modes. Two to four players can engage offline or on to either go through the game's stages or fight against each other. Even better, it's possible for players to sign in on the same machine and go online as a group, joining up with however many players it requires to fill out the session. While cooperative mode is just the single player game with more people, the versus levels are new stages. Players are divided into teams and required to destroy all their enemies' security bots. Many of the elements from the single player game such as rockets, morphing, and cloning puzzles make it into the versus modes, requiring teammates to work together to win. While online, our experiences were generally smooth, though occasionally Clyde would teleport around the screen in a particularly laggy game. It wasn't an event that recurred with any regularity.   With all its strange elements, Cloning Clyde is yet another refreshing alternative on the XBLA. For those tired of sub-par re-releases of classic games, this one's a good choice. Its graphics won't stun anyone, but they do have their own unique, cartoonish, humorous style. Sounds too are intentionally inane, though there's a disappointing lack of background music. Clyde's utterances may initially elicit a giggle, but they get repetitive rather quickly. It's definitely a game that goes well with a player-provided soundtrack. For those who like secret features, there are also a number of nonsensical cheat options that can be unlocked like big heads or devil costumes. Overall, Cloning Clyde is one of the most extensive and enjoyable games available on the Xbox Live Arcade. While it's an unfamiliar title to most, it's worth the investment.", "date": "Jul 20, 2006"}
