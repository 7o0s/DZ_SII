Ironically, it's the power under the PSP's hood that makes going back to the basics possible; with all this processing muscle, the system can actually emulate the classic arcade hardware. This is what Midway has done with its first PSP compilation, Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play. Though many of these games are still very playable and very fun on the go, it's clear this multigame pack was a victim of a short development cycle. They're not all 100 percent accurate to the original games and some annoyances - namely awful loading times - hurt the whole quick-shot, pick-up-and-play environment these games have always been known for.   Midway's made a mint repackaging its classics in compilation form for the past decade or so. The company's published three volumes of its Midway Arcade Treasures franchise, but the experience goes further back than that. The company, along with its successful partnership with Digital Eclipse, has produced emulated multipacks of retro games all the way back on the DOS PC, so at the very least the two companies know their stuff when it comes to repackaging the old-school. Or they should know their stuff.  Ever since the company started the Midway Arcade Treasures line of games, though, Midway always seems to miss the mark somewhere in the package. Whether it's a crappy interface (Volume 1), a lack of bonus material (Volume 2), or simply has a small, flawed pack of games (Volume 3), Midway and Digital Eclipse have yet to hit that ~retrogaming homerun~ in the MAT series. The PSP edition, unfortunately, follows this tradition.   At the very least, the company gets the quantity right. A wild assortment of 21 games from all over Midway's and Atari Games' library of arcade titles are thrown on one disc in an easy to navigate menu that's lifted out of Midway Arcade Treasures 2. Games in this compilation include 720, Arch Rivals, Championship Sprint, Cyberball 2072, Defender, Gauntlet, Joust, Klax, Mortal Kombat, Marble Madness, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat 3, Paperboy, Rampage, Rampart, Sinistar, Spy Hunter, Toobin', Wizard of Wor, Xenophobe, and Xybots. There's admittedly something for everyone here, from the super old-school alien shooter Defender, to the racing action of Championship Sprint. One of the oddest omissions, though, is Robotron: 2084, a game that's been in nearly every Midway/Digital Eclipse retropack since the beginning. And since the game ran on similar hardware to Joust and Defender, its absence is a little dishearteningand suspicious.   All of the games in this pack are emulated, meaning the programmers code up the PSP hardware in a way that makes it operate like the original arcade hardware. Once that's done, the emulator can load the original code and play it back as if you walked right up to the machine and put in a quarter. The emulation makes it so that the developers don't have to spend months at a time recreating the experience on a different piece of hardware, but all the responsibility is now on the emulation program to get the game to look, sound, and play correctly. Because most of these games ran on their own set of hardware, the development team had to create multiple emulatorswhich is why the emulation quality isn't consistent throughout the product.   Paperboy, for example, looks and plays correctly (aside from a ridiculously stretched appearance, but we'll get to that problem in a minute), as close as you're going to get to the arcade. The sound, however, plays back slower than the original, and is missing a few instruments in the background music. Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 got the worst emulation of the bunch, mostly because these contemporary games require a bit more horsepower; many backgrounds are missing, and the game seems to be running at half the framerate, even though it's running full-speed.   One of the biggest problems with this batch is the decision to use the PSP's wide-screen for most of these gamesgames that weren't wide-screen to begin with. So what we get is an artificially stretched view of the original game, and in many cases it turns the display into a sloppy mess of pixels that look far worse than they originally did two decades ago. Right out of the box the gamer has to deal with this problem, but luckily the programmers hid a basic code to bring the arcade games back to their original aspect ratio. The resolution's affected, but even with a few less pixels these games look sharp and brilliant when the code's activated. For those who haven't figured it out: press the L trigger and hit the Square button when a game's paused to pop the stretch-o-vision display back to normal. You'll be glad you did.   But this poor display decision is nothing compared to the main issue: load times. When a game has to spend ten seconds to load the load screen, you know you've got poor optimization issues on the PSP. It's a problem that affects how you play these games, because you can't simply whip out the system and start playing Gauntlet. No, you have to turn on the system, wait for the main game to load its title screen, then wait for the main menu. After that, selecting Gauntlet will send you into a long wait to the Loading Gauntlet screen, and then its just a short pause to the arcade game. Not a very accurate experience when these games were all about walking up to a machine and playing for a few short minutes. In the wait to load the game on the PSP, you'd have already moved on in the arcade.   Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play does utilize the PSP's wireless networking for multiplayer gaming, which comes in handy for many of these games that support two, three and four players at a time. But many of these games can't be all that huge; titles like Joust and Rampage could fit in a fraction of the PSP's memory, which is why it's a drag that this compilation is yet another PSP game that fails to support the system's Game Sharing function.  It's great to get a large assortment of good, quality classic arcade games in one pack. It's not so good when these games not only aren't represented as true-to-form as they could have been, but also take a significant amount of time to load them up for play. Midway's first PSP compilation isn't bad, but it's got enough problems that it could drive purists away. Fast. If you're not looking for total accuracy in your retrogaming then this isn't a bad choice, especially when most of these games are pretty darn close to their arcade counterparts. Just keep in mind that you'll be sitting around waiting more often than you'll be playing.", "date": "Feb 14, 2006"}
