While avenging his father's death, the Jedi mercenary came dangerously close to the Dark Side. Reasoning that the Dark Side was too tempting, Kyle has now given up the ways of the Force and traded his lightsaber in during a ~toys for guns~ drive sponsored by the local chapter of the Evil EmpireTM. Since the Battle for Endor concluded, Kyle's hired himself out to Mon Mothma and the New Republic. He and his pilot, Jan Ors, have been tasked with investigating an Imperial listening post on the planet Kejim. Republic intelligence suggested that the post was deserted but a recent transmission indicates otherwise.  That's the premise behind the next title in the Jedi Knight series, Jedi Outcast. Built using a modified Quake III engine, it's easily one of the better Star Wars games on the Mac. I've always liked the sense of weight conveyed by the latest Quake engine, but, while the models seem to have a bit of substance to them, the whole experience seems kind of swimmy. Since the game was developed by Raven, I was expecting the game to feel a bit more like Soldier of Fortune. Instead the reticle feels detached and things like doors and elevators seem too simulated.  At first, I was a little ticked that the laser bolts move as slowly as they do. What I didn't realize was that the slower moving projectiles actually give you time to dodge a bit. You can't do it all the time, but it's nice to sidestep a laser bolt that's headed right at your head. It also gives the AI a fighting chance. Enemy soldiers are quite competent and will occasionally do things that surprise you early on in the game -- like going for help or running away so they can sneak up behind you later.  For a game that so prominently features a lightsaber on the box, in the manual, and in almost all of the marketing materials, it takes a surprisingly long time for Kyle to actually get his hands on one. You spend a good while running through the single player levels before you even get a chance to pick up a lightsaber or use any Force powers. Whatever.  Once you do get them, it'll take a while to get used to using them. The controls for the lightsaber aren't as intuitive or responsive as the controls in a fighting game. There's a fair amount of sophistication here but some of it seems a bit forced. The main problem is that you're using the movement keys to input attacks. You wind up running around kind of erratically when all you really want to do is chop off some heads. Still, all my bitching might merely indicate that I'm just not totally comfortable with the lightsaber controls yet (it takes a while to get used to the feel of the game in general). In any case, it's cool as hell to smack people around with your lightsaber.  I'm also really impressed with the use of the license. This is normally a category that LucasArts excels in anyway so it wasn't too surprising, but it's still nice to see such a faithful and thoughtful use of the license. Everything here has an authentic Star Wars feel to it -- from the weapons, to the environments, to the little robots zipping around on the floor. The stormtroopers are absolutely fantastic. The level of detail on the models is damn good and the death animations are even better. Each character has specific death animations for various contexts, so you can shoot a guy in the head and just watch him crumple, or nail a guy on the shoulder and watch him go flipping down the stairs.  While the game is fairly linear, there's a decent amount of branching and usually more than just one way around a given problem. The puzzles in the game are weighted a little towards the ~d'uh~ side of things but there are a few less obvious, more inscrutable puzzles. Sadly, you can solve almost all of the puzzles you come across by making sure you push every single button you find.  Although we've devoted most of our time to playing through the single player campaign, the multiplayer matches we've set up around the office have been pretty fun. You can definitely see a performance hit even when you're running matches with just bots though. Still, when you've got a dozen guys with lightsabers running the Death Star and jumping around like crazy fools, you don't mind a few frames missing here and there.   I like Jedi Knight way more now than I did in the first few days of playing it. I think this is as much my not getting it as it is that the game starts too slowly. Normally I rail against games that don't grab my attention quickly enough but the investment in Jedi Knight II has more than paid off with hours and hours of pure, unashamed enjoyment (and more than a few minutes of rage and frustration at a few poorly conceived puzzles).  Raven's to be commended for their fantastic ~don't call it a comeback~ with the recent trilogy of shooters -- Soldier of Fortune, Elite Force and now Jedi Outcast. Each one comes with enough substance and style to fill up three or four lesser games. When it comes down to it, I played this game far too much, putting off all other obligations and interests until it was done.  Not only is this one of the greatest Star Wars games I've ever played, it's one of the best action games period. Get it, Play it, Love it.  We tested the game on a G4 733 with a Radeon 8500 card running OS X 10.2. With most of the effects turned on at 800x600, the game ran great. A little bit of choppiness was obvious when there were a LOT of laser bolts flying and storm troopers trooping about the screen, however. Bumping down to 640x480 improved performance quite a bit.  The game runs spectacularly under OS X, as well as in OS 9, so no Mac owners with the hardware requirements will be left out if you haven't upgraded to Apple's latest and greatest OS.  The multiplayer side of the game is fully compatible with the PC version of the game, so finding a pickup game to kick some Jedi butt in should be no problem. I do have two multiplayer complaints, though. The first is that you have to have the disc in the drive to play MP. The second is that the performace under MP on our 733 is much choppier than under single player and you would be wise to turn down the eye candy.  Overall the port is top notch, as you would expect from a game based on the Quake III engine. After over 20 hours of play no real bugs cropped up and the game ran beautifully.  If you like Star Wars and enjoy the idea of picking up a light saber, buy this game.", "date": "Nov 22, 2002"}
