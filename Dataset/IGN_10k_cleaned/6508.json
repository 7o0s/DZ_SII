By now, most gamers know that movie-based games tend to suck. And that's all you really need to know concerning that. For this review, you only need to know one other thing: Stuart Little 3: Big Photo Adventure doesn't suck. On the contrary, it's a great game for kids.    Developed by Magenta Software, Big Photo Adventure offers a good deal of variety and impressive design. This automatically puts the game well ahead of most kiddy titles, but also ahead most licensed games well. It's a simple game, of course, since it's clearly aimed at 9-year-olds, but it still offers enough genuine content to entertain much older players. In other words, this is one of those rare instances where ~mature~ gamers forced to play with their younger siblings really won't mind that much at all.    Not surprisingly, the game has a very simple story. Stuart Little (an intelligent boy/mouse for those who don't know) has accidentally trashed his brother's photo project. In order to keep the relationship from going down in flames, Stuart Little needs to run around snapping pictures of everything in site to replace the ones he lost. And that's really all there is to it. What makes the game so fun is how you go about proving your worth as a rodent photographer.   Fortunately, you have a number of different environments to do just that. The game initially drops you in a backyard, but you eventually make it out to the city. Not to downplay the backyard. It's actually quite impressive in terms of scope and content. You can do everything from partake in races and golf tournaments, to drive a tank and win a skateboard tournament. With so much to see and do, it's a safe bet that younger kids can become a little overwhelmed. But that's simply not the case here, thanks to a system of icons that differentiate between different tasks and mini-games.    All you need to do is run under one to start a new task, such as helping an animal find a lost item, or to start a mini-game, like one of the skateboard challenges. It's a simple, functional way of categorizing activities while still letting players explore the game world however they wish. It may still be a little confusing for really young kids, but thankfully none of the game's objectives need to be completed in any particular order. Even when you're in the middle of a task or mini-game, you always have the option to quit and start a new one.       Still, if you want to do everything in order, you can. Snowbell the Cat actually assigns you specific picture projects for you to complete. These assignments appear in a blank photo album. Throughout the game you'll need shots of you performing tricks on different vehicles, and also of random objects like flowers and rainbows. It all sounds pretty boring at first, if not entirely lame. But wouldn't you know it, turns out grabbing photos of mundane objects is surprisingly fun in Big Photo Adventure.  See, you can't just approach any subject and take the shot.  You have to earn the right to take photos by performing a series of tasks. Say you need to shoot a rainbow. You won't actually find one in the sky when you go out looking. Instead, you need to scour the backyard for sprinklers, and then turn them on. The water creates a rainbow and you're perfect photo opportunity.    Other pictures will have you don a fireman's outfit to water plants, or a native American outfit to shoot balloons with a bow and arrow. You can also drive a garage full of vehicles that include a fire truck, BMX bike, tank, taxi and an airplane. These vehicles all behave differently too. For instance, the tank isn't just a slower version of the taxi. You can actually control the turret independently and blast away obstacles. By the same token, the skateboard lets you grind on rails and perform tricks on ramps, though it won't go as fast as the 4x4 truck.   Big Photo Adventure offers a great deal of entertainment for younger gamers. There's a ton of different things to do, including a number of enjoyable mini-games, and none of it feels slapped in or arbitrary. Yes, the game certainly lacks the level of depth that seasoned gamers would want, but then, this game isn't really for them. This is highly recommended for young gamers or parents looking for a good, non-violent game for their kids.", "date": "Dec 13, 2005"}
