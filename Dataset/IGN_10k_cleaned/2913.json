I have eagerly snatched up each new revision of the Grand Prix series of games because they have traditionally been quite a lot of fun, even if they are often lagging in the technology department.   Enter Grand Prix 4, the latest edition. It has been out in Europe for several months, but I have avoided the inevitable religious debates between the devotees of the two top dogs in F1 sims: Grand Prix 4 by Geoff Crammond/Infogrames, and F1 200x by EA.    It seems that the biggest knock on the Grand Prix series is that is has been perpetually behind the curve, putting out games that often look somewhat better, but are basically just enhancements to the last major enhancement: Grand Prix 2. Grand Prix 3 brought the title into Windows, and now Grand Prix 4 is providing us with the latest graphics features like bump mapping, rain drops on cameras, visor cameras, etc.    So how about those graphics? Well, I thought some of the effects were nice. The whole environment has gone a bit further into 3D. I don't see as many 2D sprites adorning the landscape. The cars look wonderfully realistic. The tires really stuck out as being cool, because all the different types of tire, from pseudo slick tires with the grooves to the heavily-grooved monsoon tires are all faithfully re-created here. For a driving view, we now have a visor camera which essentially covers the top and bottom of the screen with a helmet blocking (although it's semi-transparent on top and fuzzed at the edges, as if it were out of focus; nice touch). However, the 'head' doesn't tilt or pan in any way, so the effect is really more of a gimmick than anything truly useful. External cameras feature beads of water hitting the lens. Although it looks rather realistic, real TV cameras are generally shielded from falling rain drops and don't exhibit this behavior.   Additionally, we now have fully animated pit crews, right down to practice sessions where the guys walk slowly out to your car and push it back into the garage.    Just how good your graphics are will, as usual, depend upon your hardware configuration. Technically, you can turn on bump mapping, environment mapping, heat shimmers, and change the detail levels of several different graphics features. I turned as much on as I dared, but I still wasn't really blown away by the graphics. Yes, they were good. But they just weren't amazing. There's not enough extra here beyond the competition to make me say, ~Hey you gotta see this thing!~ I did notice the bumpmapping on the pavement, but mainly only in very slow corners from external views showing a close-up of the asphalt.   Another little graphical face-lift was the addition of a track map that isn't just a curvy line transposed on the screen. It actually is a soft-edged circle showing you a full color track map with little symbols representing your position relative to your opponents.   With regard to track accuracy, I'd rate this a little higher than EA's title, for what's there. The elevation changes in Magny Cours and Spa seem right on, whereas EA's title seems to flatten them a bit too much. On the other hand, Grand Prix 4 doesn't provide the radically revised course layouts of Nurburgring and Hockenheim, and since EA did, this makes Grand Prix 4 look dated.   The sound is acceptable, but not as nice as the sounds in its competitor. There is just nothing particularly pulse-quickening about the buzzing in-car sound. The skidding sounds do sound nicer in this title, though, as compared to the grating, sickening sliding sound made in EA's title. You do get good crew feedback, but he's not as informative as it could have been.    One of the things that has characterized the Grand Prix series has been the accessibility options for beginners or people who do not have steering wheels. Even the keyboard is reasonably well supported. I remember there were times during online hotlapping contests when you could actually run faster laps with a keyboard than a wheel, leading to some groups banning the keyboard as an input device for such competitions. That's just how 'good' the support was.   But ultimately, if we are to judge the two major competitors on merit, it's going to come down to how fun it is, and how believable it is, and the latter is of course tied heavily into presentation.   Grand Prix 4, as mentioned, raises the bar by enhancing the racing circuits, adding lots of new graphics hardware effects, and doing away with some of the limitations of prior versions, such as one-lap-only replay saves. It also adds FMV cut-scenes with a real F1 engineer showing off a real F1 car and how it works.   If you have played either of the last two versions of Grand Prix and you are expecting something groundbreaking in the physics, stop reading here. You won't find much new here. The cars behave and feel very much the way they always have. I was hard pressed to identify a single improvement that resulted in a different feel for the car. Now that's not a terrible thing. The cars have always turned in quickly and been on the darty side, and if you've seen a camera shot of real F1 cars slaloming through the infield in France's Magny Cours circuit, seemingly glued to the road as they flick right then left, you understand why this is a good thing.   In addition, the lack of low-speed mechanical grip that EA's F1 2002 title suffers from has never been an issue here. That makes these F1 cars very quick. However, the game suffers from what I feel is a fundamental flaw: you basically just steer the car around the track. This is a flaw because steering in a real racecar is not just done with the wheel but also, and perhaps more significantly, the pedals. Transferring weight slowly or quickly to any direction has a lot to do with the grip that's available to you. Trying to stand the car on its nose under braking to make a difficult turn while using every inch of track is part of the art form that is Grand Prix racing. I must say I never really felt that in this title. I felt very much like I was playing a game that straddled the arcade/simulation fence, even with all the assists turned off.     It does exhibit some understeer mid-corner with the default setups, and slamming the throttle can get you sideways. The understeer is particularly pronounced in the rain, and you get more tires locking up under braking in the wet. I didn't feel that the brake lockup was as good or dramatic as it could have been, though. Anyway, the main thing is to just keep your tires on the pavement and don't hammer the throttle too hard coming out of low speed turns, and you can fairly around each circuit without much trouble safely. The curbing is pretty inviting, and dangerous. Put more than a wheel on it and your car can suddenly nose into the turn, and the canned physics engine seems to kick in, predetermining what's about to happen. Usually you end up going straight if you avoid spinning around completely.   Note that I did not say fast, just safely. In order to fast, you have to push very hard, and this is where Grand Prix 4 will cause your car to break away from you rather violently if you get the car too high up a curb, shortcut part of the course, get on the gravel trap, or what have you. I never feel like I can react quickly enough to catch it, and perhaps this is realistic. However, not being able to feel it and at least have a shot at catching it deprives the player of the sense of accomplishment when this is done right.   Further, the 'canned spin' problem of past games seems to still be here. This is a lightning rod in the newsgroups and a sure way to invite a religious war down on your head. But after playing each version of this game, I have to say I'm convinced that spins and their recovery are more often than not pre-calculated. This was proven to me when I suddenly went loose, then overcompensated by violently countersteering, and the behavior of the car was just...weird. It flopped back to one side and the other and stabilized before I could even finish my counter steering. I didn't stabilize the car; the game did. And again, this was with aids turned off. I'd like to think I have blinding reflexes, but I know that I do not, and no other sim seems to be so capricious in deciding your fate when you make a mistake. The bottom line on the effect is that you drive as hard as you can, but you don't really put that extra element of mental focus into the driving portion of the game, because you rather feel like it's out of your hands if you blow it, anyway.   The AI of the computer opponents seems solid. If you do bump into them you'll likely put your nose into the air briefly and maybe slide off course, but if you leave them room they generally seem to respect that and race fairly with you. They have a hard time passing you, but they will do so if they can get a good toe down a straight, and they can be passed back if you know what you're doing and they over commit. They also make mistakes and it's not that rare to encounter cars spinning off course in front of you. I did find that I could go around bends side by side with confidence. As I indicated, they are often quite tepid about passing you, and don't make many banzai runs under braking unless you are truly well off the pace. But they will stick their nose out and show themselves in your mirror, and if you are the type that rattles easily this might make you misjudge your braking into the next turn and give them an opportunity to get by.    Enough aids exist to help anyone get in, and the difficulty of driving the car is set low enough that most people can learn the circuit and race fairly proficiently at whatever their skill level is, whether they want to mess with the car setup screens or not.   Ultimately, the game is immensely playable, offering many modes of play, from time attack style ~quicklaps~ sessions to customizable weekends, quickraces, seat swapping races for two or more players, and of course the demanding full Formula One season.   Where the game really falls apart, however, is in the areas stability and the user interface. I have spent time with the game both as it arrived on disc, and with the patch that just was released, and on my shiny modern Dell with a GeForce4 running Windows XP, I can still crash to the desktop a few times an evening, for no apparent reason. In addition, the user interface can lose its ability to recognize mouse movement and respond to mouse clicks just by selecting whatever item was highlighted. The game is just not particularly stable. That's quite sad, and alone should give a prospective buyer pause. Of course the patches will keep coming so if you would rather wait that's fine, too.   The game then earns its lousiest score by sporting one of the worst user interfaces I've ever seen. The thing is just hard to figure out, and it has so many quirks and conditional cases in it that you feel like a mouse in a maze trying to find the cheese while it dangles ever out of your reach. The above problem with the menus was a case in point. Another problem is the built-in mapping of your joystick axis to moving the menu highlights. After searching desperately in the newsgroups, I found out where to go to de-activate the flickering menus, and when I got there, the joystick menu option was already disabled, and hitting ~OK~ fixed the problem. Why the problem had to exist in the first place is beyond me. Menu items will be grayed and unselectable for specified reasons, finding and viewing your replays is tedious, and the car setups screens are heavily filtered so you can't change as much as you'd like on any one screen.   What did you think of Grand Prix 4?   I could not find tire temperatures in the game. Only tire wear. That's a shame for those who set up their car largely based upon which tires are getting the most work. However, you can look at the amount of tire wear and judge for yourself how much you should soften up one or more corners of the car. Telemetry and longer replays are available. They work much like older versions of the product do, but I found the interface, again, to be tedious and hard to figure out. It was barely worth my time to bring them up.   Ultimately I'd have to say that as a realistic F1 sim this one takes a back seat to EA's title. However, if they could find a way to release a patch to stabilize the product, and users willing to tolerate the less than friendly user interface, the actual game is good enough to be considered worthy by those who may not want brutal hardcore sim, and would just rather experience the thrill of F1 racing with some assists from the computer. And of course, it would be great if Geoff Crammond and Co. could finally write a new, more believable physics engine.So in the end we get a few new features, such as the longer replays, some nice instructional videos and a bit of a graphics facelift. If you don't own any of the Grand Prix series and EA's title is too daunting for you, you might check out Grand Prix 4. If you like EA's title or want a lot more to say about what your car does, Grand Prix 4 won't win you over.", "date": "Sep 12, 2002"}
