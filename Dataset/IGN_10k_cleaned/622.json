The game begins with your sword magically imbedding itself in your father, the king's, chest.  Luckily for younger brother Yurias, aspirant to the throne, he's there to witness your crime and see to it you're burned at the stake.  As the flames lick at your toes, you call out to heaven or hell for help.  Naturally, it's a soul trading agent from below who's there to give you a hand...  And so begins Deception.  Deception is a curios mix of RPG, strategy, and first person adventure.  The RPG element is primarily in the plot.  If you choose to accept the Devil's help, you become lord and master of a macabre castle where you lure adventures to their doom for the sole purpose of bring Satan back to life.  Gameplay comes in two stages.  In the strategy stage , you build twisting corridors, rooms and dead end hallways where you place the traps you've developed.  Trap selection and placement has to be done with intruders in mind since no two types of adventurers have the same weaknesses.  The second stage is first person adventure.  Once the traps are placed, you wander the halls luring the waves of attackers into giant stomping feet, spikes shooting out of walls and falling cages that trap their souls.  How you dispose of them also has an impact on the game:  kill them for gold, sacrifice them for magic, or hold onto their bodies for monster creation.  Deception's graphics are first rate and the sound is primarily for atmosphere, but it also gives you clues about the attackers.  You can use the increasing volume of footsteps to trigger your traps.  The game is fairly linear.  There are only two points where your actions affect which of the four endings you'll see.  One comes early in the game, the other at the climax, so re-playability is pretty low.  It should be noted that saved games take nine blocks on a memory card, so unless you've got cards to spare, you'll probably only be able to keep one version.  Tecmo's Deception is a really interesting variation on the classic RPG, but it's likely to appeal to a smaller audience.  If you have the patience for a slower moving game and you like the idea of doing in the good guys, you'll probably like Deception.", "date": "Feb 4, 1997"}
