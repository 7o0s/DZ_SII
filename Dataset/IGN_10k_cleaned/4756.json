Some dude, most likely the winner of the Lindsay Buckingham look-alike contest, runs across the screen defying physics (and logic) to find the lost Zelda in a thirty second span. And you thought the ad for Super Mario Sunshine was bad...  Despite the overall crummyness of the commercial, the game went on to become a great success for Nintendo during the company's early years, which is a testament to just how great a game it really was back in the mid 80s. The rest is, of course, history, as The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo's most popular franchises, and Link is the company's ~fantasy adventure~ spokesperson. Even after a terrible run as the second portion of the Super Mario Bros. Super Show.  For the launch of the Classic NES Series, Nintendo has issued the original Legend of Zelda game, Zelda no Densetsu. The GBA game's essentially unchanged from its 1987 debut in the US. Though the emulated NES game is available for free in the Zelda Collector's Disk given away last year (as well as a rumored appearance in Animal Crossing), the Classic NES Series version marks the first time the original game has gone portable on the Game Boy Advance.  The game design of The Legend of Zelda is the foundation for all the future Zelda games released, so it's great to go back to the game's roots to see how it all began. Eight pieces of the Triforce have been scattered across Hyrule, and it's Link's (and the player's) task to traverse the massive map, enter the dungeons, solve puzzles to progress through the mazes and collect the lost shards. With all eight pieces in possession players will have the opportunity to battle the evil Gannon and rescue the Princess Zelda.   For an early adventure videogame there's a whole lot of depth and challenge to experience, and though everything about the NES game has been upped in the succeeding sequels, the original is still immensely enjoyable in portable form. The emulation is, as expected, perfect, right down to the peppy and melodic Legend of Zelda theme playing during the overworld action. It also shows how limited the NES hardware (or at least the programmer's engine) was at the time; vertical scrolling is just a tad ~choppy~ when moving from screen to screen, for example, but since the player doesn't need to control the action when moving from one screen to the next the sluggishness doesn't hinder the gameplay. Any true, die-hard Nintendo fan needs the original Legend of Zelda in his or her collection, and the Classic NES Series version might fit the bill for those who don't actually own it. The value of the game's been diminished a tad due to Nintendo giving it away to GameCube owners last year, so a 20 dollar pricetag just to have it on-the-go might be a bit much to handle. But if the price isn't an object, go for it...the game still holds a ton of play value more than fifteen years after its debut.", "date": "Jun 5, 2004"}
