Well, look no further. With great playability and options galore, this one is a definite shot in the corner-pocket. Among all the numerous features, ~walking~ (full screen rotation) around the table is the best. Not only can you study your shot from each end of the table, but you can also examine the table from a bird's eye perspective. This option helps out a lot. The physics are so precise that every angle has to be studied and accounted for. The friction, cushion response and cue position on the ball are all added in the equation to equal a real pool environment. Pool is a game of patience and precision. This game definitely tests the two.  For the diehard pool player, there are 9 different opponents, multiple play modes like traditional Eight Ball, Nine Ball, Rotation and Straight Pool, and 8 different music tracks ranging from rock to country. No Wu-Tang Clan though. If you're a pool shark or are just starting out, Virtual Pool can improve your overall skill on and off the screen. Even if you suck at pool, the trick-shot tips given by pool champion ~Machine Gun~ Lou Butera are quite helpful. Aside from the bland, flat shaded graphics, Virtual Pool is an awesome pool sim. This game gives you a real pool hall feel complete with skilled competitors and cheesy music, minus the cigarette smell and horrible food. Definitely chalk your stick for this one.
