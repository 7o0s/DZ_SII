With the introduction of the current-generation systems, several old-school publishers have heeded their fans' call, rekindling the nostalgia for classics from as far back as the 8-bit days. Konami has done it with a much needed revitalization of Contra: Shattered Soldier, Sega with the beloved Shinobi, and finally Tecmo with its very own Greco-Roman gladiator, Rygar: The Legendary Adventure. Perhaps the oldest of the bunch, Rygar brings the once relatively sophisticated NES game into the 3D world retaining the game's most distinctive function, the Diskarmor.    In the large scheme of things, Tecmo's revitalization of one of its oldest titles is a good thing. The action-adventure game weaves unusual combat and a healthy amount of exploration into beautiful 3D landscapes, and tells a rather classic tale which doesn't require players' pre-knowledge of the NES classic. As far as remaking the game goes, Tecmo has managed its core elements well, bringing Rygar into the modern ages with nary a hitch. And once again, in the grand scheme of things Rygar is a solid, likeable action game that should satisfy old fans and invite newer ones into deadly yo-yo combat.   Story  Following in the footsteps of the original, Tecmo situates Rygar in a fantasy-infused Greco-Roman storyline and lush agricultural landscape. Temco's insistence on using the idyllic countryside of Italy and Greece as backdrops for a game is an excellent notion, but its take on the myths is occasionally questionable. The story is its own, to be sure. After numerous successful battles, Rygar receives a ceremonial wreath from Princess Harmonia to declare his valor to the public. But the long-suffering Titans, evil gods banished to the underworld, have now broken free and are ready to create havoc where they see fit. So, they naturally crash Harmonia's party. The Titans create fissures in the Earth so large and devastating, Rygar falls in to one of them, only to find he has entered into an entirely different universe, where he must use the Diskarmor and learn its ways to escape from the underworld and, of course, to save the princess from ultimate doom.    That's the clear part. The backstory is a little more complicated, a little weightier and at times confusing. As players progress, they amass informational tablets a la Resident Evil, which fill in bits and pieces of the causes of the rifts between the Gods and the Titans. In short, the world is split in two: Earth, controlled by the gods of light, and hell (or Tartaros), a banished land controlled by the evil god Cronus. Cronus has created a portal called the Gate of Darkness between Earth and Hell and plans to rebel against the Gods by taking over Earth. Three human warriors, given the power of three different Diskarmors, were sent to put an end to Cronus, and using the beasts contained within their respectively Diskarmor shields, they sealed him up for good.    Years pass. An ambitious and power-hungry commander named Alexander begins an assault to take over the vast majority of Earth, including the sanctuary of Argus, guarded by Queen Argo and her companion Aristotle. He overwhelms the queen and banishes her counselor Aristotle, who transforms into a creature of the dead and who later becomes a bitter guardian of Cronus' land. It turns out Aristotle is a recurring enemy in your travels, a difficult boss who resembles Raziel of Soul Reaver fame, and who you'll confront twice.    But to make a rather mundane and long story short, Rygar is the ONE, the prophesized warrior capable of either completing Cronus' quest or condemning him forever. As you wander through the game's initial seven to 10 hours of gameplay, all of the pieces more of less come together. Tecmo's interesting use of familiar Greek and Roman myths, be they gods or stars of history, offers a confused allegorical approach for those who like their myths less jumbled. The great Aristotle as an embattled flying demon? He's just one of the many characters who are used for this interesting if slightly lightweight plot. The cast of characters is nonetheless amusing as each roleplayer fulfills his or her parts in the prophecy.    Gameplay  An action-adventure game first and foremost, Rygar is shown from fixed camera angles that sometimes get things right while other times leave you hanging. Like Onimusha 1 & 2 and Devil May Cry, Rygar not only shares similar camera angles, it quite handily borrows game functions and progression schemes as well. But more often than I would have expected, Rygar feels like Devil May Cry with Diskarmor. There isn't anything wrong with borrowing ideas, all developers do it, but with EA's The Two Towers borrowing from Capcom's game as well, Rygar looks to continue the trend with even more borrowed ideas including weapon enhancements, small segmented levels running at 60 FPS, magically closed doors, etc.   With all that Rygar has seemingly borrowed, Tecmo's game is nonetheless presented and fleshed out after its own fashion. Players start off with a single Diskarmor (Hades) but earn two more to complete the trio and they learn new moves from beginning to end. The action initially focuses itself on straight combat, slowly acclimating players to their new weapon and then later on in the game, as switch quests and physical puzzles are introduced, they're rewarded with the Heaven and Sea units, each with its own specialty.    Unlike the original Rygar, The Legendary Adventure is a streamlined affair, revolving all actions around the core strengths of the Diskarmor. The modern Rygar is without the crossbow and Pegasus Flute, but his abilities nonetheless abound, and if anything they have increased. As the game progresses, Rygar wields the Diskarmor to winch up to high spots, to grapple and pull himself across large gaps and to create distinctive combinations and special attacks that floor the enemy, in addition to summoning spells. The Diskarmor mechanic provides a hardy give-and-take, giving gamers a distinctive set of attacks fully capable of handling a single large enemy or dozens of smaller ones. While all of the Diskarmor shields share the basic functions they add specialty attacks of their own. The Hades unit is good for middle-range attacks, the Heaven unit for long range, and the Sea unit for short, quick up-close attacks. Using the L1 and R1 buttons, toggling between the three is instantaneous. And there are no mechanic glitches, slowdowns or sticking points in using the ancient dual-purpose weapon.       Deepening the use of Diskarmor was clearly one of Tecmo's central goals, and the team has succeeded in creating a dynamic yo-yo of death that acts as a multiple use weapon. Square and Circle unleash a standard attack, but with Triangle, players issue a choreographed forward launch attack that walks Rygar into the thick of battle. R1 is Block and Triangle and R1 in conjunction summon spells. Players can winch, pull and block, summon and imbue their units with magic flames, too. You can lift enemies and throw them on the ground, you can waggle-bash them or even create a spinning attack nailing enemies from all sides. The list of attacks is quite healthy.   But combos are the name of the game, and through a simple set of triple and sometimes quadruple button dial-ups, players will find the depth they were hoping for. Each unit has its own, but my favorite is the Heaven disk's tornado-like attack. Tapping Square three times followed by Triangle produces an exquisite, full-length attack in which a powerful tornado sucks enemies into its vortex, simultaneously racking up huge amounts of combos, anywhere from 25 to 50 in a row! Someone at Temco is said to have amassed 250 hits in one series. While there is a healthy amount of combos, our only complaint is that we would have loved to experiment with even more. That, and sometimes you want to turn around and attack in a different way, but the animations need to finish before you start again.    Though I desperately wanted all of the moves right up front, Rygar doesn't give everything away at once (which is a good thing). Through each new area (eight in all), players attain a new move, Diskarmor, gem or a slew of health or mana-like objects. Before I speak about the level design, however, it's worth knowing that the gems add another layer of depth. As players build up combinations, which result in a point total, they enhance the strength of their three disks, much like, you guessed it, DMC or Onimusha. Each new enhancement gives you a new slot (in the menu screen) in which to add the huge array of collectible stones you find on your travels. And, at any point, you can switch out new ones for older ones. It's a flexible system.    The stones add a wealth of extra powers, from heightened strength and bolstered defense to enabling new special attacks. And collecting stones encourages players to re-search previous areas. But the menus are sometimes a little awkward and it's hard to know what you're doing right away, since little explanation is given. Also, some of the text is incredibly small and strangely uses a serif font with white lettering on black backgrounds.    There are a number of things to like about the level design. Though you can see that Tecmo made an area smaller to keep the framerate high and the textures crisp and clean. There is a natural flow from one location to the next, and even though the game is linear by nature, the ability to re-track your steps and get to areas previously unreachable is excellent -- even if it's frustrating at first. Some levels made for more exploration than others, and in these you can usually find an immense amount of destructible objects. Everything is game it seems: columns, statues, rubble, stone, buildings, walls and doors. You name it, you can be assured you can probably break it. This too adds to the game's depth, as it encourages you to try smashing everything to see what it might provide.    Bashing things is always good but back to the point, the level design is a solid mixture of action designated and platform areas, with a healthy amount of grappling, puzzle and swinging areas snuggled in between. When you're not dropped into a bowl filled with worms and hovering freaks, you're figuring out how to climb an immense tower or get to a distant perch with a reward nestled on it. The Poseidonia Shrine breaks up the otherwise grassy, hilly levels with tunnels of beautifully textured walls, and it's where you finally receive the ability to grapple, which, when you're finally able to do it, is a great relief. Arcadia is a wild place, and Tartaros breaks everything up with a wild set of floating, platform-style rocks hovering about it mid air, completely different than anything else in the game. Although later on, Tartaros again reminds this journalist if DMC and Onimusha with its organic, undulating underworld of fleshy landscapes and pulsing walls.    There is no shortage of bosses in Rygar. From the first statuesque boss in Colosseo to the Minotaur to the five-headed dragon with sad baby faces to Aristotle and the final boss Cronus, you'll be fighting your fair share of bosses. And while the game does bring back that old simple 8-bit charm of pattern-based fights, these boss fights range all over the place. Some are so easy you wonder if the game is finished, while others are simply so hard you wonder if the game is broken. Adding another layer of boss curiosity, the last two bosses aren't nearly as difficult as the third to last. It seems there are still some balancing issues left to tune in this game that may never see that final tuning.    What last complaints do I have? Aside from the oddly tuned bosses, there are just a few ways in which I felt Rygar could have been better. The menu system isn't as self-explanatory as I'd like it to be, nor is it as flexible. I'd like to see an easier, better explained set of stones -- and how they are weighed out against one another. I would like see more flexible, dynamic attacks, with an emphasis on more kinds of attacks, and I would really like to see more enemies, which is probably this game's weakest point -- There simply aren't enough. Rygar is about 7-10 hours, depending on what difficult level you pick (there are four), and a slightly longer game would have been nice. In all, these complaints all point to one thing: a bigger game, one with more levels, more disks, more enemies, and more levels.      Graphics  Of the three old remakes, it's evident that while Shinobi looks good, and Contra moves real quick-like on PS2, Rygar takes the graphic tart cake, as it were. It's the most polished, the prettiest and it utilizes numerous special effects to good use. Each of the eight worlds offers a distinct angle into the ancient pastoral Grecian and Italian landscapes, whether it's rolling hills, idyllic cathedrals or buildings, or tomb-like ruins, adorned with accurate architecture details. Several of the landscapes offer purely beautiful settings that generate a feeling of the past, of a vast lost world, unaltered by modern machinery.    Running at a steady 60 FPS, the high-resolution graphics hit all the highlights dead on, from the many destructible objects to the special effects to the wide range of diverse textures. In fact, as PS2 games go, this one is as righteously pretty in the texture and lighting department as any of the best games on the system. As with other smart developers, Tecmo has learned the ways of the PS2: It makes excellent use of lighting effects, particles and smaller environments, in which the smaller packages of RAM can be used more efficiently. Marble floors reflect light perfectly, blurring effects are used everywhere to convey the sun's blaring heat or the heat from torches, and animated textures lay across brilliant colored and patterned designs straight from classic Greece.    Pretty amazing looking things appear in front of your eyes. The sense of proportion is immense. Giant fallen statues rest with their faces right next to your toiling figure. The sleek austere buildings also pose a giant presence that helps to create a sense of being back in time as well.   One of prettiest levels is surely Poseidonia, a water temple lavishly swathed in white backgrounds, and colored with vibrant mixtures primary reds, blues and greens. The textures and colors are swirled together, blended for maximum effect and rarely if ever used more than once in one room. Another excellent use of the PS2's power is the outer reaches of Tartaros, which shows off an ominously large outer world, replete with floating rings of rocks and a huge, impressive set of circling debris and platforms on which to jump and fight.    Tecmo has done an excellent job at handling the creature design too. Each and every one is highly ornamental, mixing hair effects with distinct textures and enormous amounts of polygons. Tecmo took some small liberties with various Greek mythological creatures, such as the giant Minotaur, but remained true to the classic interpretations too.    Sound  In synch with its elegantly textured worlds and generally good production is a lavish soundtrack provided by the Moscow Philharmonic. The themes are epic in theme, creating a serious but perfect mood for each of the levels. The soundtrack is truly well performed and produced, and though I have said it before, more games should take this approach. It gives the game a great sense of identity and it beats that stale techno any day. Rygar appears to play in Dolby Pro Logic.   Near the game's end, pop star Izzy gives it up in one of the strangest moments in the game. Freeing herself, the princess breaks into song, playing with butterflies and trying to bring peace and calm into the world. The song is a little weird, a little disarming and oddly idyllic. You'll just have to experience it yourself.   Sadly, there are several errors in the textual translation and the voice acting is occasionally heroic but stale. There is a line late in the game about the world and a feather, and it's a real doozy. You're in for a classic videogame moment.Whether Tecmo borrowed directly from Capcom's games or whether they were thought up ahead of time doesn't really matter, because the game differentiates itself well enough to warrant its own worth. Based upon the mechanism of the deadly Discarmor (aka, the yo-yo of death), Rygar carries itself pretty far, and offers excellent reasons for backtracking and revisitation. The combos, level-ups and three sets of discs position Rygar as an action game with a twist from antiquity. On all fronts Rygar is a worthy game, with perhaps its moderately short length being its only drawback. Bolstered with great graphics and a superb soundtrack, Rygar makes up for its weaknesses by displaying an array of gameplay elements woven craftily together in a game that should make any action gamer happy.", "date": "Nov 22, 2002"}
