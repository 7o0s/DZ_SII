It seems like a crime that the good shows are shunned while the new ones are over-marketed. It's also a crime that Barking Lizards developed a game that is so barebones that it feels like the video game equivalent of those Tijuana Rolex ripoffs.   Manny Rivera is a 13-year-old boy living in Miracle City, Mexico. Manny can transform himself into El Tigre with his magical belt buckle. Young Manny is constantly torn between the forces of good and evil due to a rather odd family dynamic. His father is the famous superhero, White Pantera, and his grandpapi is the villainous Puma Loco. They constantly try to pull him one way or the other.   This dichotomy is the basis for how the game is played. Based on how Manny acts, he'll lean more towards the good or bad side. At first this doesn't matter much, but eventually Manny learns special moves that can only be used when he's either good or evil. This is a strong theme of the show, and it's good the developers put it in. In fact, the game matches the show very well. The visual style, while certainly not impressive, is exactly like the simplistic style of the series. Many of the show's infamous villains are present too, so fans of El Tigre will be pleased with the presentation.   The idea of good vs. evil Manny is neat, and matches with the theme of the series, but it's just not pulled off very well. Fighting bad guys fills up Manny's good side, while destroying objects makes Manny evil. The problem is the player doesn't have much control over anything. Enemies have to be destroyed, the game won't progress until they are. Likewise, there are so many enemies on the screen that any object that is destroyable will like be demolished in the process of taking the bad guys out. If players want to try to stay on one path or the other the game becomes complicated, and sometimes it's impossible to not become good during things like boss battles. It's a cool idea, but it's just not plausible with the way things are set up.   Tijuana Tornado sounds like an illness you get after drinking the water down there. El Tigre doesn't have much else going for it either. The game is a very straightforward action platformer. Manny runs, jumps, and punches. There is only one attack button, and the combo system is indistinguishable, so El Tigre becomes a button masher pretty early on. It's fun at first, but it get's a little tedious. There's nothing else to it. No puzzles to solve, no minigames, nothing. Even the boss battles are extremely basic. Perhaps the developers were trying to keep it simple for the target audience, but the experience gets boring fast. Kids like variety, and this game has none.   Kids also like good collision detection. Half the time Manny won't even hit the enemy because the character sprite has walked behind him and it doesn't register hits. But Manny can still get hit. This leads to a lot of deaths in later levels when dozens of bad guys rush the player. Luckily there are infinite lives and players just pick up right where they left off, even in boss battles.    Problem is that takes away any challenge whatsoever. The game can be beat in a couple hours because all players have to do is mash on the A button until everyone dies. There's no reason to dodge attacks or try and survive unless they want to use the special moves that build up when defeating enemies. But chances are the novelty of slashing the stylus in a line to make Manny kick will wear off by level two.El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera has less depth and charm than a 12 minute episode of the show. There's just not much to do and what is there only kind of works. Making the game have infinite lives to compensate for how poorly its designed does little to make the experience any more enjoyable. Fans of the show get a pretty good presentation with some clever writing and nice style, but it's just such a chore to play that it makes us want to let the bad guys win.
