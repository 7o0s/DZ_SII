{"name": "Legends of Wrestling", "name_review": "Legends of Wrestling", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/06/12/legends-of-wrestling", "text": "Before The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin there were Hulk Hogan, Iron Sheik and Jimmy ~Superfly~ Snuka, along with more than two dozen others. These were the forefathers of modern wrestling. They combined high-energy brawls with over-the-top presentations and helped build the entertainment into what it is today. Now, they are the legends of wrestling.   Retired and gone though they might be, they are not forgotten, a fact proven by Acclaim Entertainment's latest entry into the genre. Aptly titled Legends of Wrestling, the offering comes to GameCube as a port of the already released PS2 brawler complete with all of the same classic superstars, a wide variety of moves and actions, a clear sense of style and a bustling multiplayer mode. Reliving the beginnings of wrestling is a good idea and the first time players rule the ring as classic Hogan they will understand the meaning of the effort. But like so many wrestling games, the end experience is flawed by lackluster execution and as a result Legends of Wrestling falls well short of its full potential.  The Facts  Over 30 of the best wrestlers of all-time including Hulk Hogan, Bret ~The Hitman~ Hart, Jerry ~The King~ Lawler, Iron Sheik, Ted ~The Million Dollar Man~ DiBiase, Jimmy ~Superfly~ Snuka, George ~The Animal~ Steele, and many more Link moves together for lethal combinations like never before with the press of a single button All-new Singles and Tag-Team career mode that bring you across the United States and all over the world Interactive wrestler entrances with introductions, crowd responses and authentic grappler taunts Create-A-Wrestler and Create-A-Stable Add logos and text to the ring attire of favorite legends by using the new Create-A-Stencil TV broadcast presentation with all-new camera angles and cut scenes Completely new game engine for improved gameplay mechanics and visuals   Gameplay Legends of Wrestling takes players back to the beginnings of the entertainment, when Hollywood Hulk Hogan was just Hulk Hogan, when the Iron Sheik was a bad-ass nemesis and Saturday morning cartoons featured both fighting it out on a regular basis. Acclaim's Salt Lake City studio, which created past wrestling efforts including WWF Warzone, is also at the helm of this project, and as a result Legends feels similar -- which is both good and bad.  The game's got all the bells and whistles. There are several different types of play including everything from the standard Exhibition mode to Versus Matches, Tournaments and a Career option. All of the modes play identically, with the ability to wrestler against one, two or three other pros. And obviously all of the superstars players know, remember and love are in full form.

Each of the controller's face buttons work as a different kind of move: grapple, strike, attack or block/counter. Pushing in any given direction can further modify these. Pretty standard, really, but it works okay enough for the style of game that Legends of Wrestling is: an action-based, arcade-style slugfest. As a result, though, there isn't infinite depth to the scheme -- not a lot of moves to work with, which might disappoint wrestling game purists, but it has definite pick-up-and-playability, which can't be discounted.       On top of the basic moves, there is a combo / countering system in place that helps to make the action a bit more dynamic. The interface for using the combo system is intuitive. Basically, when players get into a situation where they can use the combo, a cursor traces along the curved combo meter, and they have to press a button at a specific moment in order to pull it off. In two-player, this makes for a lot of interesting reversals and swings in momentum. In single player, mastery of this system will spell victory or doom. Using the combo system, players can turn an ordinary throw into a pin attempt, or apply a head-butt when someone's trying to tie them up. It works nicely. And in addition to everything else, there is a button-mashing element -- a throwback to some of the old-school games. Here players must press the A button faster than their opponent, friend or CPU AI, to pin, avoid being pinned, or to make it through specific moves. It works very well and there is a certain sense of nostalgia to it.  It all sounds good and fine -- the design is definitely commendable. But like so many wrestling games, the execution is flawed. Control is slow-going and clunky. The simple process of moving around the ring is robotic and tedious. Wrestlers walk and move about the ring as if trapped in mud -- not as if they are quick and agile athletes. There are collision detection problems so sometimes when players try to grab onto opponents, they don't actually grab, or when they think they've connected with something it doesn't actually happen. There are physics glitches. And because of the simplified control scheme, the list of moves quickly becomes repetitive. The end experience, marred by these shortcomings and oversights, isn't nearly as fun or exciting as the overall design suggests it might be, which is very disappointing.  A Create a Wrestler or Legend mode is also included in the game, and in it players can model and build a superstar from scratch, or modify an existing superstar. The feature comes as a welcomed addition, offering players the ability to customize faces, body types, add different styles of pants and shirts, belts, set entrances and music, and more. But the create option, like much of the game, doesn't go very deep into the rabbit hole. Players can choose different faces, for example, but individually build one choosing eyes, nose, mouth, hair and etc. Meanwhile, the selection of different pants and shirts is limited in comparison to create-a-wrestler options in other games.  Graphics Gamers interested in Legends of Wrestling solely for its attempts at presenting the classic athletes in a play environment are in for some disappointment. Acclaim's title delivers one of the poorest presentations of wrestling -- any time or era -- that we've seen yet. From terribly generic menus and black load screens with blurry wrestling cards to look at, and to horribly created wrestler entrances shot from odd angles and void of excitement, the thrill just isn't there. Only the sheer amount of wrestlers in the game makes up for these.  On the upside, though, the look and style of Legends of Wrestling isn't nearly as gritty or realistic as some other WWF-based products, and this works. Rather, Acclaim Salt Lake City has opted to go with a more colorful, rounded, even comical look. To this end, many of the wrestlers in the game sport exaggerated features. Character models, bulging and skinned, appear as if they are wax replicas of the real athletes. It's an interesting chance of pace from the wrestling normal. These characters do take real-time damage, too, so if a wrestler is punched in the face enough, it will eventually turn red with blood.  Animation is strong at times and unforgivably flawed others. At one moment Hogan can be hurling himself off the ropes to a ~bullet time~-like paused camera -- very impressive, and at another the character will be jerking around the ring madly as players attempt to run from an opponent. It's definitely a mix of good and very, very bad.  The ring itself is modeled well enough, but the crowd could use some work. It's on the bland side and lacking animation. Meanwhile, players will notice flashing lights do affect player models in the ring and there are character shadows that darken the mat. The framerate is occasionally unpredictable, particularly with multiple wrestlers on-screen at once, which can prove troublesome for fluidity tarts like us. Finally, the particle effects system, particularly blood (which can be turned on), gets the job done, allowing for sprays of the red liquid with big punches. It even splatters the mat. All in all, not a bad graphic look, but the technology could use some serious tweaking.  Sound It's very disappointing that in a game meant to enable players to become their favorite classic wrestlers, not a single true voice sample from any of them is present. Instead, gamers are treated to a sub-par selection of grunts, thumps, and static crowd noises. Even the theme music for each wrestler is poorly composed and constructed. A very lackluster aural experience.The gaming community needs a proper wrestling game. Not a pretty good one, or a half decent one, but an honest to goodness kick ass title -- one that does for wrestling what Tony Hawk's Pro Skater did for skateboarding. That has yet to happen -- on any system. So instead players are made to settle.Legends of Wrestling is a mediocre wrestling game. It's got a great selection of old-school wrestlers to play with and some good design ideas, not to mention a refreshing graphic style, but like so many wrestling games, it's all hopelessly scarred by sloppy execution. Slow, tedious controls hamper the experience greatly, collision detection problems scratch it further, and graphic shortcomings -- from jerky animations to an unpredictable framerate -- ruin it more still.It's your money. Don't settle.Recommended only as a rental to hardcore wrestling fans and those looking to rekindle their relationships with the wrestlers of the past.", "date": "Jun 12, 2002"}
