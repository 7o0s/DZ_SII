But can the glorified sock puppets survive a massive musical attack when the former fuddy-duddies Statler and Waldorf lay it on down on the ones and twos? Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, and the gang must don their best pop and lock gear and find out in Muppets Puzzle Party, a new rhythm game from mDisney.   Muppets with grillz? Some games you may be prepared to dislike on principle, as the Muppets don't need Juicy running pants to be cool. (They just need better writing -- the once-edgy Muppets have been de-fanged with some juvenile writing in recent years.) But give this rhythm game a chance. It starts off with the simplest mechanics -- simply matching notes based on shape and color -- but after a few stages, Waldorf shows no mercy on the wheels of steel and your thumb get a major workout as you slap away bum notes and try to hit enough combos to really see your favorite Muppet bust out some sweet moves.   Using just the thumbpad, you press left, right, and up to fill three boxes above your dancer's head with notes. The notes flutter from the deejays slowly at first, giving you ample time to set up combos, but soon the pacing turns aggressive and you must work fast to keep turning the beat around. You can make matches by shape, color, or note -- and several combinations thereof. However, the biggest bonus comes if you manage to line up three of the exact same shape, color, and note.   Muppets Puzzle Party includes two modes: Quick play and challenge. The quick play is good for practicing your moves, but the challenge mode is as meaty as Miss Piggy's thighs. You must complete a series of stages by fulfilling objectives, such as a set number of points or combos. Every time you complete a string of stages, you unlock a new Muppet.   The game features five original songs, although none of them of particularly memorable, they are certainly better than some of the beep-boop jingles you've heard attached to mobile games. The Muppets are all instantly recognizable, even in their hip-hop clothes. The disconnect between Statler and Waldorf's normally stuffy demeanor and seeing them sporting bling is funny.  Hopefully, Muppets Puzzle Party is enough of a success for Disney to keep bringing Kermit to mobile -- he's always a welcome sight. The game offers a few hours of challenging game play, especially in the back half of challenge mode when the difficulty skyrockets. This is not going to replace Tetris in your puzzle-lovin' heart, but if bought on subscription for a month, the Muppets offer a fun diversion from the usual block-dropping and gem-matching scene.", "date": "Oct 11, 2006"}
