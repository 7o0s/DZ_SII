Wow.  Set in the fabulous Las Vegas casino of the same name, Caesars Palace enables virtual gamblers to build their wallets, or drain it dry, in one of many games of stakes. You can start off small on the slots or blow it all in the Blackjack Room.  What's really good about Caesars Palace is that it caters to every gambling skill level. For the more serious gambler, there's craps, baccarat, and blackjack. However, if your newbie to gambling, and you don't know what the hell you're doing, this game has a tutorial mode that shows you how to work all the crazy games housed in Caesars Palace.  Now I hate to pick at minor flaws, but the announcer and crowd noises in this game are uncontrollably annoying. They sound like busted Speak-n-Spells. And since most casino/gambling games are pretty similar, great sound is one thing that can either make or break a game of this genre.  If you like casino games, and enjoy blowing huge amounts of cash, Caesars Palace should satisfy any gamer who enjoys gambling titles.  Jay Boor", "date": "Nov 5, 1997"}
