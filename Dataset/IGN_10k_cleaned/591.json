A direct puzzle-for-puzzle port of the PC title              of the same name, BSII carries over amazingly well, especially in              a few of the key categories that make or break titles in this genre.              BS II won't break any barriers by any stretch, but it will reward              you with a nicely-paced adventure that challenges without becoming              over-intricate.              Gameplay             Broken Sword II starts out simple enough: George Stobbard has just                been reunited with his girlfriend who he had to leave in the first                game to visit his dying father in America. Now back in France, George                is looking forward to spending a little time ~getting to know~                his girlfriend, Nico, but not before she suggests they stop off                at the house of Mayan archaeologist Professor Oubier.              You see, Nico's been busy since George was tending to his father.                While on the trail of a drug-smuggling ring, the journalist stumbles                across an odd obsidian stone. Thinking the professor might know                what it could be, she drags George along to find out.             Unfortunately, all George finds is a club to the back of the head                when he enters the house, a tarantula slowly heading towards him                when he wakes, and his recently reacquired love missing.              Without giving too much away, BS II's story stretches from the                drug-smugglers Nico was investigating, and grows to involve an ancient                Mayan cult with worldwide extinction on their agenda, and all the                while, various puzzles are being tossed at you in classic point-and-click                adventure form. While nothing totally original, the puzzles seem                just hard enough to make you think, but not so difficult that you                spend hours trying to move on.             While most adventure games work great on the PC, simply because                they're mouse driven, console adventure games more often than not                don't support the PlayStation mouse (BSII is no exception), and                have to rely on the controller to move around in and interact with                the surrounding game environment. This tends to give a sluggish,                unresponsive feel, or an overcompensative, too-touchy experience.                Broken Sword II manages kill both problems with a feature that should                be in EVERY console p-and-c: dual controls. The left analog stick                controls the fast movements, and the d-pad controls the more intricate,                detailed movements. Add to that the ability to change the sensitivity                for both controls, and you have a flawless control scheme.             Gameplay really only consists of pointing and clicking on various                elements of the environment, which is why near-perfect controls                are essential. With the control issues solved, BS II's focus now                shifts onto the second most important aspect: the presentation.             Graphics             The PC version of BS II was actually two CD's. When you compare it                to the PlayStation version's 1, you have to expect that there was                a little compensation. For whatever reason, Revolution must have                figured 1 CD would work better, and the general quality of the graphics                has taken a slight hit. A reduced color palette means the FMV and                backgrounds aren't as sharp, but unless you can see them side-by-side,                you won't be able to tell the difference.              Animations in BS II are remarkably like those found in Lucasarts'                adventure games. Hand-drawn animations are fluid, and unlike some                of the earlier adventure games, objects that you can interact with                don't stand out from the background, giving a cohesiveness to the                graphics that really keeps you looking hard for objects to interact                with. In fact, there are instances when George uses his fingers,                and given his size on screen, it's amazing that you can easily see                the motions.             The FMV sequences are nice (although nothing spectacular), offering                more of the same cell animation found in the game, but with the                obvious advantage of more detail.              Sound               Point-and-click adventures absolutely MUST have great sound, not                just in sound effects and music, but in voice acting. Your character                is always talking to you, whether it's directly to you or just speaking                out loud, what you hear must be enjoyable, or there's no real point                in playing. Fortunately, BS II's sound is fantastic. Music punctuates                moments and provides mood exactly as it should, while the sound                effects are clean and sharp.  The voice acting however is probably the single best part of the                aural experience. Perfectly read lines totally make the characters                come to life. George has an honest, dry wit that makes it a joy                to actually get responses from him. The other characters are just                as nicely acted, with emotion and attitudes coming though with crystal                clarity.  This type of               adventure game isn't for everyone. Interaction is accomplished solely               with a cursor, and it's a very relaxed, methodic approach to gaming,               that might turn more action-oriented fans off. If you like to think,               though, and are looking for what is probably the best console point-and-click               adventure game available on the PlayStation, then step right up.               Revolution joins Sierra and Lucasarts as one of the finest crafters               of adventure games I've seen in recent years, and the fact that               it's pulled off so nicely on a console just makes it more rewarding.               Beautiful control and voice acting, good animation, and a nicely               executed plot all add up to a fun, well-rounded experience.", "date": "Jan 4, 2000"}
