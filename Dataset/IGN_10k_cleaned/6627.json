For example, sometimes you just want a normal, reliable cup of coffee -- not a double maple mocha espresso with soy milk, no matter how new and exciting the barista makes it sound. Superscape's JAWS 3D is kinda like that pleasingly familiar cup of java -- it brings absolutely nothing new to the table, but instead takes what people would expect out of a shooting/action game based on the movie ~Jaws~ and delivers just that. You sit in an underwater cage and shoot sharks. That's it.   And for what it's worth, I was entertained for a while. Will this be an epic game that I keep on my handset forever? No, but I'm definitely going to keep it for a few weeks longer and see how many sharks I can pick off to serve my master Quint. There are worse ways to wait for ~Capote~ to start, you know.   JAWS 3D is indeed 3D, and not just in the way that its sharks are polygonal.  The gameplay itself rotates around the four sides of an underwater cage.  You judge the distance between yourself and the sharks and try to harpoon them before they get too close. And they will get uncomfortably close. From time to time, the sharks will tire of circling the cage and make a run at it. Sometimes, you can spot it coming. Other times, a flashing red arrow points to where the shark is. You start to turn to shoot, but sometimes you just cannot get there quick enough and you have eighty zillion teeth in your grill. Honestly, these moments are pretty effective at first.   Every shark you take out is worth credits you can spend at Quint's harbor shop. The bigger the shark is, the more it is worth -- but the more shots it takes to bring down. Quint actually has quite a bit of gear to help with that, such a barbed harpoons and explosive-tipped harpoons. When a real monster is bearing down on you, you need to switch to heavier spears to keep it at bay. You buy the extra harpoons in limited quantities, so you need to be selective as to when you use them. For example, if I saw a medium-sized shark, I would wait for them to start their approach before switching to the barbed harpoons so I could hit it with a single, guaranteed shot. Quint offers extra oxygen tanks, cage upgrades, and a shark sonar to help you stay in the water longer and score more kills.   Between shark shooting and shopping, you have to select where you want to dive. Some spots around Amity are more infested than others. You'll get a few free tips at first, but pretty soon Quint starts charging you for tips, that old salt. So, this does introduce a little strategy to the proceedings.   Moving underwater is kinda slow, and while that might be a little annoying elsewhere, it's not in JAWS 3D. After all, you are underwater. It also heightens the tension, as the sharks are not particularly slow -- they're used to living in the drink.   JAWS 3D looks pretty solid. The underwater scenes are awfully blue -- as expected -- which really emphasizes the shark models. They look good close-up. The topside stuff is all static screens, with Quint's mouth frozen in a shape that makes you wonder what's happening below the frame. And if it's legal. The game does have a little dirge to accompany this tense action, and underwater, you'll hear bubbles, well, bubbling up around you.  JAWS 3D is pretty decent diversion. I liked that it delivered exactly what I expected. I thought I'd be shooting sharks, and that's what I got. In fact, I got to shoot sharks with a variety of spears, which actually make a difference on how you fare under the waves. The shark models look good and, like I said above, they actually are a little scary the first few times they bump the cage. If you like puzzle and card games, JAWS 3D isn't going to blow your hair back. But if you want an action game, Superscape's shooter might be your bag.", "date": "Feb 16, 2006"}
