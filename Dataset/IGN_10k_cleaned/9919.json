Originally a best-selling mobile game, Gameloft ported its paddler over to the iPod in an effort to solidify its leadership position on the nascent gaming platform. The click-wheel proves to be more than adequate to handle the brick-bashing game, but is there enough going on in this download to warrant a $5 purchase over those Paula Abdul songs you guiltily enjoy when nobody's around?   Block Breaker Deluxe fuses the classic ball-and-paddle action with a light story mode that follows the exploits of a wannabe playboy. Gameloft loves to flirt, filling its games with curvy, come-hitcher ladies and granite-chinned dudes that always know the ~it~ vodka of the moment. The ultimate stakes in this Miami-influenced landscape is a yacht. But to get a shot at the prize, you have to beat a series of challengers, wooing them with prizes while proving your skills with a paddle.   Kinky.   The mechanics are as expected. You slam the ball into a series of patterned bricks with your paddle. Some bricks are shattered with a single, glancing blow; others require multiple hits. Some are indestructible while others explode like bombs, incinerating the surrounding blocks. There are also blue bricks that drop power-ups like a magnet that holds the ball, a shield along the bottom of the screen, a yo-yo that lets you recall a shot, and lasers that blast bricks while the ball is in play. There are hazards, too, such as an invisibility item that prevents you from seeing the exact position of your paddle. You just keep slamming those balls into the bricks (the multi-ball and giga-ball power-ups are especially useful) until the screen is absolutely empty.   As you break the blocks championed in the title, you must also collect as much cash and prizes as possible. Gifts that tickle the fancy of each level's host cascade from hidden locations. At the end of a board, finding that gift results in bonus points. Money prizes and extra lives (shaped like hearts) also drip from the smashed bricks. And each round offers a particular challenge, such as clearing the board within a specific time limit or not losing a ball, which also pads your pocketbook. You can use this cash in a store to acquire fun items.    Gameloft polished up Block Breaker Deluxe a bit for its trip to the iPod, but the game still does look a tad behind the curve of its cleaner, cooler Brain Challenge. The character portraits are fun and the map screen is a little hip, but too many assets reminded me of the mobile download that had to work within some serious size limits. Also, if you do not like hot neon pink, this game is not for you.  If you have already played Gameloft's Block Breaker Deluxe on your mobile, there isn't enough new here to warrant another purchase. However, if you're into that Breakout-style of action-puzzler, Gameloft's offering is good fun. The breezy atmosphere and solid control make this an easy game to come back to time and time again until you finally captured that coveted yacht.", "date": "Jan 29, 2008"}
