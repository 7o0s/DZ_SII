Nothing else can explain the genesis of Bling Games' Lil' Jon Crunk Golf, a silly trifle of a golf game staring the rapper of ~What?~ and ~Yeah!~ fame. Mercifully, though, this isn't just a basic golf game with an after thought license. Instead, the urban theme woven into the mobile game affects most -- if not all -- of the mechanics, which is one of the hallmarks of a well-handled license.   Now, this is not necessarily an endorsement of the game. I thought it was amusing at first, but after about ten holes, the fun of seeing Lil' Jon flash his gilded grill up to the screen and exclaim ~YEAAH!!~ after a great shot was not enough to sustain my interest. But I do believe that Bling has definitely done a solid job incorporating Lil' Jon into the game that bears his name.   ~It's time to play golf,~ Lil' Jon shouts at the start of the game. You control Lil' Jon as he stands on New York City rooftops, mixing the sport of golf with a little bit of destruction derby. You don't have to select clubs, putt, or worry about pin shots. You have to instead hit billboards, windows, scaffolding, and people on the other rooftops. You can bounce balls off the sides of skyscrapers and hit bank shots on satellite dishes.   These alternatives to basic golf are certainly cool, but the controls are not very intuitive, despite the tutorial levels. When you start a hole, you have a set number of balls to achieve your goal. You must stop an arrow that moves back and forth to determine the direction of your shot, and then fill up a Lil' Jon meter to determine the power. You can attempt to control the accuracy of your shot by holding the button down wile the arrow is moving, but I found even these finesse controls to be underwhelming and not very useful. I thought I was aiming at a dude on a roof, but the ball would seem to fly off no matter how I tried to affect the accuracy.   The system of using ~crunk juice~ to later put some English on your ball is also not very useful. While the ball is in the air or bouncing around a roof, you can hold down the button to use up stored juice to try and direct the ball to your target. But holding down the ~OK~ button and trying to steer the ball just doesn't work very well. The crunk juice you don't use during a round is dumped into a gasoline tank for bonus points.   As mentioned, Lil' Jon Crunk Golf certainly looks and sounds the part. Digitized voice samples from Lil' Jon are everywhere in the game. The little Lil' Jon and the other people in the game are drawn using what looks like a modified cel-shading technique, and the effect certainly works.  Lil' Jon Crunk Golf is a kick at the get-go, but peters out far quicker than it should to warrant a download. If you are some insane-crazy Lil' Jon fan, you may be able to overlook some of the game's shortcomings just to have Lil' Jon on your handset. Even I smiled when Lil' Jon would yell out ~YEEAAHH!!~ How can you not? But I stopped smiling soon afterward when my shots were consistently off, even though I sat there and used finesse to modify trajectory and whatnot. A couple of times I wanted to throw my handset to the windows, to the walls.", "date": "Mar 29, 2006"}
