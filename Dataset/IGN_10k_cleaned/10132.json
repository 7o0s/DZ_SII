Now, SuperVillain Studios is bringing that experience to the PSP via the PC PlayStation Store and portable gaming enthusiasts are definitely in for a treat.   If you're unfamiliar with the original flOw, the extremely simplistic title gave you control of a small aquatic organism and tasked you with descending deep into the oceanic depths in hopes of evolving into a greater, more beautiful creature. Gameplay was not only easy but the experience as a whole was streamlined to create a Zen-like journey of light and sound. flOw provided a fantastic experience, if you were willing to accept a more unorthodox style of gameplay.     Now that flOw has arrived on the PSP, gamers may be wondering just how the title has made the leap onto Sony's portable system, and I can assure you that -- for the most part -- the change has been very commendable. The PSP version of flOw looks and sounds very similar to its PS3 counterpart and the grand majority of the content is going to be identical across the two versions. Let's take a moment to explore just what you'll find when you dive into the ethereal waters.   flOw was clearly designed with simplicity and elegance in mind. When you start the game, a brief set of instructions pulses into view on the title screen. Afterwards, you have complete control of your organism throughout the rest of the experience with very little interruption involved. Each ~level~ is merely a two-dimensional plane viewed from a top-down perspective. In order to dive deeper towards your ultimate goal, you simply need to touch the small creatures lined with red arrows. Similarly, touching the creatures with blue arrows will send you up a level. Besides these basic rules, your only purpose is to consume other organisms in order to evolve.     Originally, the PS3 version gave you control of your creature through Sixaxis support, which is one of the best implementations of motion control on the console to date. Tilting the Sixaxis controller would guide your creature in that direction, while pressing any button would activate that creature's special ability. On the PSP however, movement has been assigned to the analog nub -- no movement support is given to the d-pad. Any button will still activate your ability, so little else has changed.    flOw does many things beautifully well. The artistic style is calming and the game's audio deserves special note. This is a game that absolutely demands to be used in conjunction with a nice pair of headphones. Although the soundtrack is a minimalist one at best, comprised mainly of delicate strings and meandering choirs, the music fits perfectly with flOw's style. Again, it's virtually identical to what you'll hear in the PS3 version, but that's fine with me. Sound effects are equally serene, as piano notes or similar tones will ring out whenever you consume another creature. I highly recommend playing at night with headphones, perhaps before sleeping. The resulting experience is humbly euphoric.     Unfortunately, flOw isn't strictly an experience. I must also consider it at its more basic components, which is as a game. Actual gameplay does have a few problems which take away from the grander picture. Using the analog nub is considerably more precise than motion control, but completely contrary to the immersive feel that motion control delivered. Crunching your thumb over the nub just isn't as comfortable as holding the Sixaxis controller. When playing the original flOw, you could almost keep your hands open, palms up, and use very slight motions to guide your creature. This approach was highly conducive to the game's greater purpose, and the analog nub just doesn't cut it.   Also troubling is the slowdown present during certain sections of flOw. It's definitely worse than the PS3 version, which is unfortunate because the framerate for such a simple game shouldn't have to suffer extensively. Also, flOw for the PSP doesn't offer any of the expansion content recently made available for the PS3 flOw, which is a shame.     And of course there is a degradation of image fidelity when dealing with this version of flOw, but that change was inevitable when making the jump from an HD enabled console to a handheld.   The last element of flOw that works to the game's disadvantage is the multiplayer. In theory, the multiplayer dynamic is very cool: as long as the WLAN switch is turned on, the game will automatically scan for other players near you and instantly connect the players, letting you dive into the depths as a group (up to four). I had mixed results with this, because we had a hard time getting two PSPs to locate each other. It seems like it only worked when one player was in the character selection screen and a second player then tried to jump in. Otherwise, a connection was hard to come by. What's worse is that when you finally get properly synched up with a fellow flOw player, massive slowdown plagues the game. Your experience won't be rendered unplayable, but it's not ideal.    The aforementioned issues with flOw are disappointing but the overall experience is still not one to be missed, especially if you play alone (and thus escape the majority of the game's slowdown issues). flOw's immensely surreal style will please anyone with an open mind regarding game mechanics, and $7.99 isn't too bad a price for a digital taste of Zen.", "date": "Mar 4, 2008"}
