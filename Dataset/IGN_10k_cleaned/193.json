And it's really no wonder why, either.  The guru of portable handhelds was made for gaming on the go, and play-while-you-walk ship-blasting seems to be a more popular choice than sit-down spell-casting. Nontheless, there are those of us who cry out for a nice, long adventure, and while Game Boy has never been a mean RPG machine, there's no doubt that there are plenty of them out there to whet your whistle.  Staying true to the old-school code of role-players like Dragon Warrior, Revelations: The Demon Slayer upholds level-building over story, and still manages to be a fun game despite the lack of ingenuity. Features  More than 100 monsters to join your quest Fusion System: Combine two creatures to form a new one Fight against another player through the Link Cable More than 100 types of weapons, armor, and magic Three save game slots More than 20 hours of gameplay For Game Boy and Game Boy Color  Revelations is as down to earth as a role-playing game can get, and it's simple to tell as soon as you enter your first battle.  If you've ever touched Final Fantasy, Earthbound, or any others of the kind, you know exactly what to do, and you'll be able to play like a pro.  Without strategy involved, make your choice from a list of commands, and either bludgeon your enemies to death with a weapon, or fire some sort of magic spell. It couldn't be more simple than that!  You'll be able to either weave magic or utilize different attacks, but the interaction between  your crew is set at a major bare minimum. The basic character, El, is on a mission that has a vague feel to it, one in which he seems only to be interested in obtaining power enough to become a Gaia Master. The others, who join you for various reasons (all pointing to the fact that you saved their lives) are practically there to only aid you during battle. Very little is described, and the characters hardly interact with one another, meaning that few details about those striving on such a dangerous quest are released. As you scamper around the overworld, you'll have litte to do other than search dungeons or caves, meaning that there isn't an overflow of variety.  And since Atlus didn't go all out with a story that rivals Lord of the Rings, you'll end up spending most of your time on the battle field, so there's definitely not an extremely large amount of variety to what you can do. However, Revelations tries to spruce that up by allowing you to talk to monsters during battle, and sometimes they automatically talk to you.   It's definitely a strange addition, and is often more annoying than anything else.  You are given several YES or NO questions, and the monster with whom you are speaking may join up with you, depending on what you choose.  The problem, though, is that you never know what to pick, and chances are that you won't be able to convince your enemy to go with you, meaning that it's just wasting your time.  On top of that, the questions are repeated an AWFUL lot, and begin to sound monotonous after just a little while.   The graphics are definitely reminiscent of the 8-bit wonders of years ago, and look nice when teamed up with the Game Boy Color.  The music, just as equally fine as the graphics, fits in just right depending on the situation, whether it be a tune for strolling through town or lurking in the depths of a dark dungeon.  With many places to go and quite a bit to do, you won't find yourself the least bit annoyed with neither sight nor sound, and that's certainly a refresher.  Revelations is an enjoyable game to play, yet its goals are usually unclear, and the characters in town rarely hint to what you should do next. On top of that, the plot isn't exactly of Squaresoft proportions, and will usually only deal with Person A being kidnapped or Object B being stolen, all of which certainly won't bring you to the edge of your seat, quaking in fear.  Nonetheless, Revelations stands out as one of the better RPGs for Game Boy, and is absolutely perfect for adventuring on the run.  If you want to immerse yourself in nostalgia and remember how much fun the old NES games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior were, there couldn't be a more enjoyable portable epic than this.  The versus mode is also a good inclusion, especially if you have a link cable and a friend.  Since there's a serious lack of RPGs for Game Boy outside of the common Pokemon and Final Fantasy Legend, Revelations is welcomed aboard the crew with open arms.  Although it's not perfect for everyone, it should appealto those of us who are constantly keeping our eyes open for hand-held journies with tons of battles based on choosing from menus.  If you're interested in a role player that goes back to the days when the genre wasn'tredefined with 32 bit technology, Revelations is the game for you!", "date": "Aug 28, 1999"}
