{"name": "Twisted Metal 4", "name_review": "Twisted Metal 4", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/23/twisted-metal-4", "text": "The great combo of violence and automobiles has come a long way since Road Blasters, and that's thanks almost entirely to SingleTrac's Twisted Metal series. Sweet Tooth and company deserve their flaming props for their service to their contribution to car combat carnage, and so the fact that this latest edition of Twisted Metal is strong enough to obliterate the memories of the abysmal third TM warrants a play through. 989 has concentrated their efforts in the right places in this one, and while the game doesn't control nearly as well as Vigilante 8: Second Offense, there is a lot more strategy and concentration of battle heat in TM over V8. But is that enough to invite Calypso and Co. back into your home? Gameplay Twisted Metal 4 is all about the heat of battle. Sure, there is some kind of story about something happening and somebody ruling the world and an Alderanian princess you have to save... Fate of the world, blah, blah, blah. Just get in there and bomb the crap out of the place.  Despite the 'fantabulous' TruPhysics (which, for the slow of mind, is a combination of the words ~True~ and ~Physics~), we hate the control of the cars in this game. Let me repeat that, lest this point not be taken seriously by 989's TruPhysics department: We hate the control of the cars in this game. They feel like Matchbox toys, with no mass, gravity, suspension, acceleration, true turning radius, road grip, or velocity. The game plays just like Codemaster's Micro Machines games. If you have a toy car by you (and, for some reason, every desk here at IGN has several toy cars handy at all times, so I will play along with you as you read on), put your finger on the roof of the toy and wheel the little auto around your computer stand. That's the feeling of driving Twisted Metal 4.  But you can't launch Napalm out of a Hot Wheel (at least, not without some heavy modifications and a parent's supervision), and that's the fun of Twisted Metal. No TM has had a particularly realistic physics engine when compared to, say, Need for Speed. Cars accelerate to top speed in seconds, corner on a dime and slow from 150 to 20 in a car length, float through the air gracefully, and crash into each other without much disturbance (although there is damage rendered and displayed). However, the gameplay is in the warfare, and so while 989 didn't do a damn thing to improve on the rueful TruPhysics of TM III (cars flip less -- that's about it), they wisely concentrated their time on an excellent variety of bombs and weapons that make any Twisted Metal live up to its namesake.  We just finished up a revelry of battle with Turok: Rage Wars, so I am a little too spoiled by the ingenuity of Acclaim's creative spirits to really give Twisted Metal 4's armory its due, but the breath and resourcefulness of killer artillery in TM4 is very good. Unlike V8, there is a lot of strategy to the weapons (and TM has a much more ammo -- also a plus). Many are bombs that you can detonate from afar; others are proximity bombs that can be placed in key areas (such as warp points) to trap the competition. Missiles rarely seek their target, so you will have to aim carefully (unfortunately, most rockets are rather dinky and miss easily because they are so small), but they make up for their difficulty in use by their use in battle. Some bombs ricochet down halls, while others detonate on walls and spread their blast radius out to catch bystanders. Some personal favorites are the Freeze Remote (which freezes any car within a given distance, making this a great weapon for campers looking to drop the wrath of god on a group of baddies), and the Napalm (when you light a baddie on fire, any other car he runs into also catches fire).  The enemy AI is also strong in Twisted Metal 4, making up in some small part for the choppy and slow (but still playable) 2-player mode. The enemies will do the kind of stuff that would really tick you off if it were your buddy playing -- they'll sit behind corners and lay freeze mines, then pummel you into the ground with rockets and machine guns blazing as soon as you happen by the trap. They'll also drive backwards and launch mortars at you as you pursue. It really feels like you are playing against other human competitors.   Also worth mentioning are the well-done interactive environments. There are things you can blow up to find special armaments (though the game doesn't have nearly as many destructible features as V8). More impressively, there are several landmarks in each site that add to the replay. For instance, sometimes you will find pools of acid that, when lit up with Napalm or some other incendiary device, will explode into Lake Inferno. There is also a course that features a magnetic crane that you can control to grab up enemies and drop  into a car incinerator. The environments are all very big and feature a number of multi-tiered battlegrounds. However, their size does make for some lonely moments of hunting down targets, and the radar doesn't help you until you are just about on them. Graphics Flashy and colorful, but not terrific. Environments look very good, with a vast view distance and lots of little details running by as your speedometer pegs 130. Everything is very colorful and looks interesting when compared to the rather formless landscapes of V8 -- a vast improvement over TM III in every possible way. Some levels are stand-outs, particularly Sweet Tooth's Bedroom (where all cars are miniature toys as they run around Micro Machines' style in an oversized boy's bedroom, complete with Hot Wheels ramps and a TV in the background) and Neon City (which features train tracks you can drive on and a bullet train running on a schedule of mayhem). Others are more boxy and less involving (The Carnival was especially disappointing, as it features an open-air environment that leads mostly to other open arenas). The game has a collection of lighting effects that look nice, and the cars accrue damage as they are trashed.  But again, the game controls like a Micro Machines racer, and this filters down into the look. They look and move like toys. Miserable little toys. Crappy little hoaky child's shiny toys. You can get up right behind them with the camera, but it just looks like you've brought the car up next to a toy. This game just screams out, ~You...Are...A...Toy!!!~ This really hurts the game, as nuking a toy car with an imaginary driver is just not as fun as nuking a real car with a real guy inside it.  What's worse is that the cars are rather small and flat, and that makes seeing them at a distance sort of difficult. They don't seem to be six feet tall. Even the vans and trucks look tiny, and though the draw-in distance is pretty far away (pop up occurred in the background but not much on the actual playfield), you may have a tough time seeing the cars that you want to blow up because they are so petite. Couple this with bad frame rates in the two-player mode, and you suddenly have a game with looks that work against itself. And the four-player mode is absolutely laughable -- although it does have a decent framerate (somehow), the cars are so flat and small that you won't even know they're right in front of you. Sound While muted, the sound of Twisted Metal 4 is pretty heavy. The Dolby Surround stereo effects surround you with the chaos that ensues all around you on the battlefield. Blasts rock the speakers, so when you get nailed, you know it. Bullets are sharp and have a ricochet to them (though the sample of bullets tearing into metal isn't very worthy). Bombs can constantly be heard exploding in the background. Weapons load up with a shotgun shuck sound. The music is also characteristically pounding, with tunes by Cypress Hill and Rob Zombie (some music choices are especially bizarre, which I like a lot). The soundtrack is not as well mixed as anything from DreamWorks (the best sound designers in the business), but it does a good job of conveying that there is a lot of anarchy going.  HOWEVER (and I stress this only because this is indicative of what is wrong with this game), the motor sounds are not only weak, but also betray how basic the game is. They rev up to a point and stop. There is no second gear. Cars simply get up to speed with a whir and stay at red limit. They sound just like those Match Box cars that you pull back and let go to race on your mom's linoleum floor (notice the running theme here?). So not only does the game's battle tank fail to strike fear into me with it's toy-like stature, but it also disappoints my audio sense by sounding like a toy tank.  I have never liked Twisted Metal. Not when the original garnered rave Game of the Year awards, nor when the second grabbed press like a fiend, and certainly not when the series went down for the three-count. However, I can understand the phenomenon. It's fun to blow sh*t up. But that's what V8 does, and does well. V8 also has much better car control. Perhaps that makes Twisted Metal obsolete.We had originally written off the series entirely, and 989's track record with sequels made us even more callous of this one (More Cool Boarders? Hurrah...) However, after the blistering Jet Moto 3 gave me new hope for fun in sequels, I became the Twisted Metal stalwart fan boy amongst a group of jaded gamers. Our own Doug Perry thinks pretty lowly of TM 4, because of how it has turned the once great series into a toy melee. If you value Doug's opinion (as many gamers do and should), skip this one and hold a candlelight vigil for the series to get better with new hardware. Nobody else in the office had any care for the series at all to even voice an opinion one way or another (Thanks, Twisted Metal III. Thanks a lot).On my part, I think the game has its strengths, and certainly looks good. It has strategy and some good thinking behind it. The graphics are nice and fast, and two-player is still fun (some courses are better than others in terms of frame rate). It's fun to play, if you really get going in it. However, Vigilante 8 feels like a real car combat game. Rent this one, in memorial of Twisted Metal's legacy, and try to see this as a short-term reinvention of the wheel. You may have fun, as I did, but you won't feel a brush with greatness from the once towering Twisted Metal series.", "date": "Nov 23, 1999"}
