But the team had previously been working on a conversion of Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed for DSI Games even before then. Even though Porsche Unleashed may have been in the development queue longer, it feels entirely half-baked due to a weak set of features and lacking gameplay. Features 25 different models of Porsche cars Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridge) Cartridge save (four slots)  The Game Boy Advance design is loosely, very loosely based upon the PlayStation version released nearly four years before. It's so loose, in fact, that the only relations the two games share are the title and a similar line-up of vehicles to drive. Porsche Unleashed is a very different style of game than the already-released Underground design, so even though it's the second Need for Speed game released on the GBA in four months, it's not a simple redux of last year's Electronic Arts release.  But that doesn't mean Porsche Unleashed doesn't share similarities with Need for Speed: Underground. Since Pocketeers handled both titles, each game's core utilizes the programming team's extremely impressive (at least for GBA standards) 3D engine that allows for fully texture-mapped 3D environments running at a relatively smooth framerate. The engine definitely runs smoother from inside the cockpit than outside, most likely due to the fact that the GBA has to push out more polys due to the on-screen vehicle. Overall, either view is completely playable, though the gameplay definitely favors in-vehicle players due to a significantly better framerate.  On a technical level, the game works. Just like Need for Speed: Underground. The development team definitely has the 3D thing going on hardware that was never meant to do it. The problem is, at least so far, the team has a hard time tying that engine into a thorough racing design that at least keeps up with what's been offered in other racing games before it...3D or not.  The game's single player competition structure, like in Underground before it, is just a bit sloppily contrived, with only a loose, basic interface linking one race to the next. The game's garage shows off the many different Porsche vehicles available to the player, but there's no indication on performance of any of these cars...which makes it extremely difficult to pair up different models against each other in a race. Tracks have variety in their locations, but their names occasionally don't show up before a race...which makes checking out the record times all the more confusing. And even though the game features a cartridge save, it doesn't feature a good amount of expected statistics tracking beyond the best five track times per track.  The actual racing is a bit better. It's definitely challenging with good competition against several computer AI controlled vehicles, but collision is extremely bouncy to the point where vehicles barely drop in speed after bumping into a wall. This may be considered ~helpful~ for novice racers, but the ability to take turns by simply letting your bumper nudge against a wall gives the game a very ~autopilot~ feel. Tracks don't have varying terrain between the road and the wall, and where it looks like players can go off-road, the designers stick in an awkward invisible barrier. And the track designs occasionally do things that even the computer AI can't even anticipate; when a 90 degree turn pops out of nowhere and the computer controlled cars nail into it as if it shouldn't be there, you know the track design needs some serious tweaking.  And that doesn't even touch upon the fact that the game only features cars in the Porsche line of vehicles. After getting Need for Speed: Underground's huge line-up of different manufacturers and models, only having the ability to drive and race against other Porsche vehicles just feels very limiting...especially when each one utilizes the exact same on-screen dashboard regardless of which car is being used. And the reward of more Porsche vehicles as unlockables isn't exactly a driving force to keep going through the ranks of the races. Need for Speed: Underground did have its own set of negatives, but at least it offered a huge assortment of extras to encourage deeper play. Porsche Unleashed is a impressive-looking racing title that definitely has its moments, but ultimately its faults and omissions bring down the enjoyment significantly. It shares a lot of the good and bad points of the previously released Need for Speed: Underground game, but last year's game definitely received more attention during its development cycle. Especially when compared to Need for Speed: Underground, Porsche Unleashed feels more like Porsche Unfinished..", "date": "Mar 29, 2004"}
