The graphics, oh, so painful to look at. The on-field players possess, give or take, three frames of animation. To give you a better picture, it's like watching the soldiers from the 8-bit Nintendo version of Contra running around on a football field. It just looks bad.  Unfortunately, the gameplay isn't any more impressive than the graphics. With an outdated player interface and a useless passing meter, this game is just as aged as its endorsee.  Perhaps the only saving grace in this game is the sound, but other than that, Jimmy Johnson's VR Football 98 is flat out dull. In fact, I can honestly say that it's one of the worst sports games ever to come out this year.  Jay Boor", "date": "Nov 4, 1997"}
