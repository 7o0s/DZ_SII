But rather than cannibalize the game by ushering out the sequel, I-play cooled its heels on the inevitable Jewel Quest II. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, as the expression goes -- and the time away from the JQ franchise has left thousands of thumb eager for a little gem-cracking puzzle action.   Well, hopefully you practiced in the interim, because Jewel Quest 2 assumes that you're at the top of your game. This sequel is hard, ratcheting up the difficulty after only a handful of stages that reacquaint players with the mechanics of matching gems to turn the background grid into a field of gold. (And, later in the game, you must transform it from gold to silver.) With a strict time limit and some irregular-shaped puzzle fields, Jewel Quest II offers level of challenge not seen in mobile puzzler for some time. You'll chew on this one for a long while.   While filling in the fields, the biggest obstacle to victory is easily the shape of the puzzle fields. There are little single-square corners that can be a real pain to fill, but when you do, there is definitely a slight charge of accomplishment. Critics of Jewel Quest have said that the appearance of jewels just feels too random, but if you're fast about matching elsewhere on the screen, you should eventually cause a proper cascade that offers the much-needed trio of gems.   If you cannot fill in these small spaces before the time limit expires (which is merciless, by the way), you can rely on the ~gold~ button, mapped tot he left soft key. When pressed while the cursor is over a sandy space, the gold action gilds the background even without a match. You earn use of the gold button through big combos. You might feel tempted to hoard these life-savers for a rainy day (or a particularly troublesome map), but if you run out of time and have to start over, you lose your gold supply.   As you progress, the game hurls more challenges at you, such as gems stuck on cracked spaces that cannot be swapped. You must bring the matching gems to it. Only after clearing the cracked surface beneath it can you then gild it with another match. Some cracked spaces hide an unmovable gem that you cannot even see. To clear it, you must move the right gems next to it and hope for the best. That's just mean. And, in some ways, I mean that as a compliment.   Cursed gems decorated with skulls undo previously gilded spaces until they migrate off the south end of the screen. Empty spaces can be filled by pushing gems into them, resulting in a new set of gems falling from the top of the screen. And, as mentioned earlier, later stages require you to not only turn the whole screen gold, but then silver when an entirely new second set of matches.   Did I mention that this game is hard? Much harder than the first Jewel Quest?   So, will ultra-casual gamers bow out? Doubtful, as the game ropes you in with presentation that is superior to the original in every way. Perhaps the advent of higher resolution cellphone screens is a bit of a help (I tested JQ2 on a w810i), but the cleaner puzzle field and snazzier gem sprites really make JQ2 an attractive download. Between rounds, you're treated the sepia-toned story of Professor Rupert Pack -- you in-game avatar -- as he explores ruins and tries to outsmart the villainous Sebastian Grenard. Along the way, you'll also meet Rupert's love interest, Emma Swimmingly. Does this story really matter to the story? Not at all, but little touches like this that elevate the game beyond the usual crowd of jungle-temple-jewel-themed puzzles that have infiltrated the decks in recent months.  Jewel Quest II is a great sequel to the very successful original puzzler. It adds some new mechanics and really improves the production values, something that I think will go a long way toward keeping eyeballs on the game. There dozens upon dozens of puzzles, so this isn't one you'll finish up in a weekend.I mentioned in a few places that the game is much harder because I think it's extremely important for prospective downloaders to know and it also helps explain why I scored it lower than the original. The first JQ was hardly a breeze, but expect to replay puzzles more than once in order to clear them and move on through the game. This does add a lot of replay value to the game, but I confess on occasion, it wasn't the kind of replay I necessarily enjoy. ~Come on, stupid gems!~ I would occasionally exclaim while playing, but with some added colorful language. If you suffer from the same kind of verbal slips, you may want to play Jewel Quest II in private, too.", "date": "Jan 20, 2007"}
