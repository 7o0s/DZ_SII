The game plays just as you expect it to and comes with the built in dictionary with plenty of words that you have never heard of. To give cheaters the edge, the game also comes with a hint key. But let's say, just for the sake of argument, that you hate UpWords' button down, blue nose stuffiness. Well our dear old Uncle Hasbro has got a new version of the game that might shake things up a bit...at least as much as an UpWords variation can shake things up. We're not talking profound and sweeping social changes here. After all, it's just a game. There are also a plethora of backgrounds to choose from for those who care about that sort of thing. Not that I don't care, I'm just mentioning it as news.  The standard game version starts with you placing tiles on the board or on top of other letter tiles to form words. Scoring is based on the number and height of the letters used. There is, of course, the traditional bonus for using all your letters in one turn, a whopping 20 points; and the bonus for using the ~Qu~ tile in a word that is all one tile high, a measly 2 points. And -- insert big surprise -- the person with the highest score wins. I love it when they mix it up like that. Sort of turns the whole boardgame concept on its head, much in the same way that Scream 2 redefined the way we look at movies. The pioneering spirit lives on confined to space capsules, bathyspheres and boardgames.  But there's also a new game called Challenge Upwords, where the player scores points by having the most tiles on top of the letter stacks. In this version you are given either black or white tiles and the common tiles -- j, k, qu, w, x, z, etc.-- are gray. This is a little strange at first but very addictive once you get the hang of it. Rather than progressing straight up, your score goes up and down during the game because you and your opponent are constantly trying to one ~up~ each other. Lordy, that's some good punnin'. This game also has a rule that allows you to place a letter on top of the same letter in order to come out on top. This game really is good as a change of pace from the more traditional version because it requires new strategies, and that makes it a worthy addition to this classic boardgame adaptation.  The game plays well with no rough parts. Maven, your arch nemesis, has settings that range from 'not too bright' to 'damn, that's good.' I actually tried to play against Maven's top setting by using the hint key the whole way through and still lost badly. I would hope that the hint feature would give you at least an even chance but c'est l'upwords. If you want a challenge for your word skills then this has all you'll be able to handle and then some. I found that the middle range was about right for a reasonably close game with the savor level just where it should be when you've beaten a worthy but admittedly inferior adversary. He's good enough to deserve respect, but only because I'm so high-minded.  One problem that bothered me was the tiles cast a shadow to show where they are going to go. It tended to be rather confusing because the natural reaction is to put it right above the spot you want it placed -- not just above. This is something that you get used to but it seemed a little odd. One other problem that I had, and have had with most PC word games, is that it challenges words that I think are good and then uses words that are, to say the least, unusual. Or even better, it actually challenged the word 'meals' and then on the next turn put down the word 'meal.' So then I put an 's' on it and it takes it. Well, they're just computers. Sometimes you just have to throw up your hands and say ~01000110100010.~  As for the look of the game it has a variety of backgrounds to choose from such as the diner, picnic, western, beach, two versions of an office -- cause really, one is never enough -- soccer, sixties and the imaginatively named fish. The music on all of them is equally bad but there's no reason you can't pop in your favorite Doc Watson or Melissa Manchester CD and go where the spelling takes you. The background noise isn't too bad on some of the levels. I especially like the gun fight on the western background and the bubbling fish tank is rather soothing, as is the sound of waves on the beach screen. But the sound of children playing on 'soccer' and 'party' aren't very good for the concentration, whether they are realistic or not, and 'diner' has all the annoying silverware clanking and noisy conversations that makes you remember why the World UpWords Championship is held at the lovely Budapest Marriot in downtown Pest and not in Sparky's Diner. The menus are easy to use and the network play is not much trouble at all.  Overall this is a solid game. The game play is good but doesn't have a ton of variety for the more demanding puzzle gamers, you know who you are, and the look of the game is slick without being oily. And if there's one thing we all hate it's an oily puzzle game. Believe me I know what I'm talking about. If it's a puzzle game then trust the expert.  -- Duncan Turner", "date": "Feb 10, 2000"}
