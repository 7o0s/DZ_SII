In a testosterone drenched industry where the biggest star is a half-naked woman with overly enhanced boobs running around taking out the bad guys, it seems strange that it took so long for someone to get around to license TV's half naked woman with overly enhanced boobs running around taking out the bad guys.  No, not Wonder Woman, but that heroine to all 15 year olds (and their fathers) Xena.   So let's get one thing out of the way straight away. This is no Tomb Raider and if you are looking for a direct competitor, this isn't it. As games go, it's hokey, silly, and anachronistic mindless fun. But then, so is the TV show.   Xena's foil is the beastly Kalabrax who has escaped the stone temple imprisonment decreed by the gods as punishment for her spying for the Titans. Determined to create a new world order and exact a revenge on the gods, Kalabrax sets out to acquire the ultimate power. Now in human form, Kalabrax needs a mortal human Queen as a sacrifice to unleash this unholy terror. Xena's sidekick Gabrielle, as Queen of the Amazons, is her intended victim and it is up to Xena to save her.  Gameplay Xena features 21 levels of different challenges featuring everything from standard town and castle combat, to labyrinths, Amazon woman and a visit to Hades domain. In a standard third-person view, Xena wanders around dispatching nefarious characters and collecting various power ups on her journey to the Temple of Pinnacles. Some of the more interesting levels are the earlier ones set in Oebalus where the bad guys are holding hostages and Xena must use a long distance attack to take out the enemy before they off their captives. It's a shame that this game mechanic wasn't used more often in the later levels. Xena uses standard slashing spinning and kicking attacks. Into the mix are added various lever, pulley and jumping puzzles.    Within the levels are some quality game design that designers Steve Morris and Kraig Horigan can take credit for. One of the goals of level design is to throw in a challenge which is hard enough to take multiple playings to figure out and yet solvable before the game player throws the controller at the screen in disgust.   One example of this is the Isle of Kronos where the Cyclops initially cannot be attacked but must be induced to throw the rocks in the correct direction to reveal not only the exit from the beach but also some needed power ups. The Cyclops is also an example of the varied enemies that feature both monsters from mythology plus creatures and standard humans. The undead that continue to fight even after being hacked to bits is one of the ways in which the game tries to be different.   The levels are involved but not particularly deep and the overall time of play is an issue. Only Xena could have so much skin exposed running around in snow covered mountain levels. On the positive however, the snow levels set in and around the village of T'ir Na, like the Oebalus levels, have a better feel than those set in Hades domain.   Power ups are limited but useful. The most plentiful is the blue potion of health that automatically replenishes Xena as needed. Armor and sword upgrades along with a resurrection jewel round out the standard power ups. The magical power ups add a little more strength with the ability to freeze your opponent or send out bolts of lightening. However, the standard attack mode remains, when in doubt move forward and hack and slash.  Control Control revolves around four basic components and one innovative game mechanic. The components are, slashing, kicking, jumping and blocking although the later is used very rarely especially in the earlier levels. On top of the basic moves there are a considerable amount of combinations that feature everything from a cartwheel to a groin kick. After successfully executing one of her advanced moves, Xena will let out her patented warbling yell, which is most apropos for atmosphere but does get a little old after a while.  Probably the most difficult control to get used to is the run. It's not needed until the bee attack in the level On the Trail of Gabrielle, but is useful in general as a running attack appears to do more damage than a walking attack.   In both the TV show and the game, Xena's weapon of choice is the Chakram, a sort of Frisbee on steroids. There a button combination that sends the Chakram out of Xena's hand in the direction she is pointing. However, the Chakram is can be guided in flight, and the camera leaves Xena and follows it in its path. This makes it useful not only as a long range weapon but also as a reconnaissance device able to see around corners and take in terrain not normally seen from Xena's view. The Chakram returns once it has hit a target in the distance. With practice you can hit a target in the distance and then taken out a nearer enemy on the return journey. In at least one level, players will need to use it to hit a small section of a drawbridge to open up the next section. It's by far the most innovative part of the game.  Atmosphere There also are some nice little touches. In one level a dead captured shark is strung up on the dock. It's just there for atmosphere and yet if you repeatedly take a sword to the shark everything from fish and anchors to jolly roger flags and half eaten surfboards will fall out of the mouth. Yet another has a posted sign ~This way to the Lost Temple.~ Very anachronistic and very in keeping with the TV show.   It's a shame that Gabrielle was not used more as a base character. A game that featured two-player co-operative play controlling both Xena and Gabrielle would have been most welcome.  Graphics The game suffers from comparison to the latest generation of games. The animations are limited and the character drawings could be better. And yet, again, it feels OK. This is not to say that a well-implemented graphic treatment would not be welcome but ironically because it is Xena, it is somehow forgivable. However, this charity does not extend to the warping and camera clipping problems that occur throughout the game. These two problems impact gameplay at inopportune times (not to mention the excessive pop-up).  Sound Xena is unobtrusive with all the appropriate clangs, bangs and oofs that you would expect from a hack and slash title. Both Xena and her enemies utter occasional banter, although Gabrielle seems to be limited to ~Help me Xena.~ The pacing of the music is very good and lends a certain urgency to the proceedings. A nice rumble of thunder accompanies the flash of lightening when appropriate and really helps to create the mood for a level. In all candor, Xena Warrior Princess is a strange title that is likely to get panned by much of the press. It certainly could have used multiple difficulty settings and graphically it is a couple of years in the past. When compared straight up as a game title it is lacking and yet the game is usually an enjoyable experience. Based on a TV program that defines mindless fun it shouldn't be surprising that the licensed game mimics this. A classic example of a title designed to meet a certain criteria. Whether you like Xena will depend on your gaming experience and overall mood.", "date": "Oct 6, 1999"}
