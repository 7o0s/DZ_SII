You need to keep the game authentic for those who love the physical aspect of throwing down cards, but you also need to entice those looking for an actual videogame, too. Blending these two elements successfully rarely happens. Sometimes it works - just look at Magic: The Gathering Online, for example - but this is the exception. It had just enough style and videogame newness to make it a worthy purchase for fans of the real-world card game.   But what usually ends up happening with these kinds of games is a little different. Most of them offer nothing new in terms of content or style, severely limiting their appeal to all but the most diehard fan. Which brings up another point: diehard fans of card games usually play on a regular basis with a core group of friends. And unless all these people have the same game system and a copy of the game, much of the appeal in digital card games vanishes - the only thing to play against is the CPU. Such is the case with Warhammer: Battle for Atluma, developed by JV Games. It's by no means a terrible game, but it fails to offer loyal Warhammer fans something new. There's also little attraction for those new to the Warhammer universe, too.     For those who may not know, the Warhammer property encompasses a gritty universe filled with ancient creatures and modern weaponry. It has a very distinct style that sees orcs and goblins brandish oversized battlaxes and firearms. So it's a shame that Battle for Atluma isn't more stylish in its representation of the Warhammer world. The cards themselves look good -- that is to say, they look like their real-world counterparts. But using them on a PSP is no different from playing on a table. It would have been nice to see a collection of animations to illustrate each battle. Failing that, each card should have had at least a little but of animation. Again, these games succeed or fail by how well they exploit the power of a game system - Atluma doesn't use the power of the PSP at all.   Granted, no amount of visual flair or animated battle scenes would fundamentally change the game, but it would have warranted the move to the PSP a little more. Not that a drastic change in rules is what fans want, of course. And in this regard, Warhammer does in fact succeed as a good port of the card game. It offers just about everything you'd expect, including the wide array of defensive and offensive cards, as well as abilities. As your progress through the ~campaign~ mode, it's possible to buy new cards through the gold you earn. Earning new cards and constructing your deck is rewarding, though sifting through the collection once built is a cumbersome process.    And speaking of the campaign - there's really not that much to it. There's little narrative to speak off, in fact. All you do is move from one encounter to the next but the game offers little incentive by way of story or characters. Which is unfortunate because an engaging story would have added a lot to this game - even more than snazzy visuals and cool effects would have. Each successive battle does offer a greater challenge, but apart from that, players are given little reason to continue. The game does have a few multiplayer and network options. It lets you battle live opponents, which is the only real appeal with card games in the first place. It also lets you wirelessly trade cards, which is a nice addition. Like with most other aspects in Battle for Atluma, it would have been nice to see a little more substance, but all the multiplayer options work fine.  Warhammer: Battle for Atluma offers a very bare-bones experience. It adds very little to the established card game by way of visual flair and enhanced gameplay. Having said that, the game does retain the depth of physical card game. But theres little here for those looking to get into the Warhammer universe, and even less for those who already own their perfect deck.", "date": "Jan 18, 2007"}
