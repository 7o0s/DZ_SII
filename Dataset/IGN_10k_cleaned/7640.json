Since then, The Sopranos have become one of television's most critically acclaimed series.  Thanks to David Chase, the series creator, fans have come to know the complex inner workings of the Soprano crime family, as well as the chaos that surrounds each character's life.  Now, HBO and THQ have partnered together with Seven Studios to bring a taste of La Cosa Nostra to the PS2 in The Sopranos: Road to Respect.  However, instead of feeling honored that you've been recruited into La Familia, you'll probably wish that you'd been whacked instead.   It can be extremely tricky to figure out where to set a game that's based on a long running television series, because the designers have to figure out what elements to keep and which ones to ignore or toss completely.  The other trick is figuring out how to make a game that won't spoil any secrets of the series.  Well, David Chase managed to strike a balancing act between these two by placing the action between Seasons 5 and 6 of the television show, breaking it out like an ~unaired~ episode of the show.  Players take on the role of Joey LaRocca, bastard son of the late Sal ~Big Pussy~ Bonpensiero.  Joey's down on his luck, and starts out as a simple purse snatcher on the streets of Jersey.  However, one day he's stopped in front of Satriale's by Tony Soprano, who recognizes the trouble that Joey's getting in and the pathetic state of affairs that he's in.  Instead of pummeling Joey, Tony gives him a job working for Paulie Walnuts as a new enforcer for the family, which would allow him to potentially become a made man if he pays his dues and follows instructions. During the game, Joey will do much more than simply beating up people and enforcing the will of the Soprano Family.  He'll wind up falling in love, get in the middle of a potential mob war and even save Tony's son from being killed by angry business partners.    Now, if you're a fan of the show in any way, you'll recognize what kind of a problem having the bastard son (or any son, for that matter) of Big Pussy in the Sopranos crew raises.  Christopher constantly raises this objection, and yet it's generally swept under the rug as Tony simply decides to give Joey a break.  That doesn't really seem to be keeping with the character of Tony or events that have occurred during the run of the show, and yet it's not explained why exactly he decides to be so friendly.  Part of this might be attributable to the limited focus of the title itself: Tony, Paulie, Christopher, Silvio and Vito comprise the majority of the cast, and with the exception of AJ and a quick mention of Hesh at Nuovo Vesuvios, there really aren't any extraneous cast members around. (Technically, you could call the ghost of Big Pussy included, but he's handled much more like Joey's conscience every now and then, and he doesn't really affect how the plot unfolds either.) Nor will you really have the chance to explore the massive world that the Sopranos live in -- you move from the Bada Bing (which acts as the game hub) to very specific, very contained areas in a linear fashion.  Any outdoors settings that even offer you a hint of exploratory freedom immediately warps you back to the start of that level if you deviate from the path, so you're pretty much stuck on the path that's given to you without a lot of variation to the gameplay.   Obviously, as muscle for the Family, Joey will need to pound some sense into people that have angered Tony, Paulie, or other members of the Soprano crew.  Fortunately, he's good with his fists, and he's got a number of moves that he can use to beat people down. Players will have the option to use either light or heavy attacks which you can string together into combos. You can also use grapples to potentially trigger one of the special attacks that Joey gets, such as breaking arms, smashing an opponent's head into the ground or choking them to death.  You're not limited to using your fists either, because you can grab any one of the objects scattered around the environment to get your point across.  Whether it's a baseball bat, plunger or a barbell, Joey can wield these weapons to take out anyone that stands in his way.  He can also drag people to specific hotspots in environments, such as refrigerators or table saws and punish people in that way.  Finally, Joey can always resort to firearms if he needs to take enemies out from a distance.    While the inclusion of the various weapons and hotspots in the game is an interesting addition, the system is flawed for a number of reasons.  For one, the only time that you can touch an object that's a weapon is if you're in the middle of a fight.  You can't conceal one and you can't bring one with you from one place to another.  This can force you to run around, looking for something to pick up as a defensive measure, especially if your opponents are all wielding bats or something with a long reach.  Another problem is that it's too easy to obliterate someone once you have a weapon.  With careful timing, you can keep an opponent on the ground or continually running into a swung object without taking a scratch of damage.  Another issue is the strength of the special moves. It's extremely easy to beat an opponent to the point where Joey can pull off a special attack, which will immediately take that person out of a fight. It's possible to take some enemies out in 15 seconds or less, which is particularly disappointing.  What's more, you'll barely wind up using firearms in the game because of the strength of your fists and weapon attacks.  Apart from potentially knocking some enemies through walls, eliminating the fight entirely, you'll rarely need to pull a gun and shoot back unless someone is firing at you, which doesn't happen in the game a lot.    As I said earlier, you won't have to constantly rely on your fists.  Negotiating through verbal mine fields is one of the keys to Joey's success throughout the game.  During conversation, Joey will be presented with one of three choices that he can use as a verbal response: Tough, Smooth or Neutral.  Tough responses usually involve verbal threats and suggestions of physical violence.  Smooth reactions, on the other hand, can be much more passive and conciliatory. Neutral replies can be either one, depending on the situation.  Based on the option that you choose, you may find yourself starting a fight or diffusing a situation.  What's more, certain conversations require different approaches, so you can't always choose to be entirely passive or aggressive, or you'll take a hit to your respect meter. It's an interesting system, but one that's slightly complicated by a few bugs that may wind up getting you stuck in conversation loops, as well as the fact that you don't really have a lot of time to decide what kind of response you want to make.  Essentially, you're given a sentence or less to decide if you're going to have a positive, neutral or negative response, and if you try to take a second to decide what the best response might be, the game will make a choice for you, which may mess up your respect meter unintentionally.     Of course, with a game subtitled Road to Respect, being particularly mindful of your actions is vital to your survival.  Joey can potentially cross the Family by doing things like pulling a gun in inopportune settings or making the wrong verbal decision.  The more you specifically lose respect and draw attention to the Sopranos business, the more you risk being whacked by a member of the crew to cover up your mistakes.  Players that are in serious trouble of sleeping with the fishes can make up for their offenses by paying tribute.  You'll gain the money for these payments by searching downed opponents, picking up spare items throughout the world, and completing missions.  You can also score some quick dough by playing Texas Hold'em with the Soprano Crew once you've been deemed worthy to sit at the table. Now, if you pay off your mistake and you want a little extra standing, you can donate a little more money and unlock some hidden content like game art and location sketches. This is really what the tribute envelope is for, because you'll rarely, if ever, need to use the tribute envelope to save your neck over the course of the game.     Unfortunately, Road to Respect isn't very visually striking.  While the designers spent some time trying to make the main characters look like their real life counterparts, they really are hit and miss.  The better looking ones are AJ and Christopher.  Many of the older characters, like Paulie and Silvio, appear to be facially frozen with the same expression, regardless of the dialogue that they're delivering.  The other character models aren't necessarily horrible, but they don't particularly stand out either.  Some of them are blocky and have stiff, robotic movements.  In fact, it seems like the strippers (or almost nude strippers) at the Bada Bing received the majority of attention for the game.  Environments are slightly better, particularly the ones taken from actual show locations, because you can see the amount of additional detail that went into each place.  However, since the amount of interactivity that you'll have with each location is practically non-existent (apart from limited hot spots) you'll probably not appreciate it as much.   The voice acting, however, is much better than the visuals, thanks to the contributions of the cast members from the show.  James Gandolfini leads the other cast members in good delivery of their lines.  Some of the minor characters may make you wince every now and then, but the overall vocal work is nice. Some of the cursing, while understandable given the show and the context of the game, may feel a bit forced or simply thrown in because the F-bombs could be dropped, however. One minor fault is the weaker soundtrack.  Sure, there's ~Girls, Girls, Girls~ for the Bing and ~Woke Up This Morning~ as a recurring theme song, but a lot of the other songs seem like they were just thrown in as a licensed mix of tracks that wouldn't necessarily fit with the rest of the show.Considering how important respect is on the television show, The Sopranos: Road to Respect does a disservice to the series.  A linear plot, flawed combat and conversation system hinders the title, and a lack of difficulty doesn't help the replayability factor at all.  Only diehard Sopranos fans will be interested, but even they will probably make this disc take a dirt nap after playing through it once.", "date": "Nov 22, 2006"}
