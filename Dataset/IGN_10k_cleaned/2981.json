The idea was to make a console game possessed of some of the qualities that make the Tribes franchise unique, rather than exactly re-create the PC Tribes experience on PlayStation 2.  So, since the game's creators have already settled the often-touchy question of comparisons to the PC version (they've openly stated that players of PC Tribes have no reason to try the PS2 game), does this work as an online console FPS in its own right?  My answer would be a qualified yes.  The game still shows its PC roots in several ways, but it also manages to compensate for the peculiarities of a console control interface while keeping the important aspects of the Tribes series intact.  Its online support seems to be solid enough, although modem users are obviously not going to have as much fun as their broadband cousins, and in a surprising turn, the bot AI does a great job of compensating for a possible lack of fellows to play with.  The first-person controls will always be a sticking point for some, particularly thanks to Aerial Assault's retention to the traditionally massive Tribes level scale, but again, there are some smart measures in placeto compensate for that potential problem.  Gameplay Tribes is a game of first-person team combat, mainly capture-the-flag, played out on massive indoor-outdoor maps.  The scale of the game is bigger than just about anything comparable on a console -- even if Aerial Assault is something of a step back in that regard, compared to the PC's Tribes 2 -- but the amount of mobility each player possesses is just as substantial.  Along with the usual complement of zap-guns, rocket launchers, grenades, and other implements of destruction, every player also has a jetpack, which serves to loft them across the map in great aerial bounds or speedy powerslides.  The key to Tribes on an individual level, then, is learning to use one's mobility to the fullest.  In one-on-one encounters, a slow, defensive strategy is rarely rewarded as much as the active use of speed and flight capability.  In turn, however, Tribes is rarely played out on the individual level.  This is a team game, and one with an unusual amount of room for different players to specialize in a particular role, which in turn complements those of their teammates.  As in PC Tribes, there are three basic character types (light, medium, and heavy), with customizable equipment loadouts to further refine a player's purpose within those types.  Aerial Assault retains nearly all of the character customization options from PC Tribes 2 -- it's only short one or two minor weapons -- as well as much of the PC game's logistical component.  Each team has a base of resources: the inventory stations that provide equipment, the vehicle stations that provide support vehicles, and the energy generators that power both of the above.  Attacking the enemy's resources and defending one's own is as significant a component of strategy as actually capturing the enemy flag.  The PS2 game does have a smaller and less versatile vehicle lineup than its PC counterparts -- just bikes, fighters, bombers, and transports, all piloted by a single player -- but that's understandable given the smaller size of the maps and the inevitably lower player limit.  The point is that, in terms of the larger strategies involved in a game, this still feels like Tribes.  When you can get a CTF game going with a good group of people, it has that same fast-moving ebb and flow, as players work together to attack and defend both the flag and their base resources.  The bot AI helps out a lot in this regard, because the CPU players are smart enough to do more than just shoot straight.  Depending on how they're set up, they'll take part in more complex defensive and support strategies, working to repair the base and set up remote inventory stations to back up an offensive.  As far as individual control is concerned, things are a little more uncertain.  While Aerial Assault has good movement controls -- it's not hard to get around with the jetpack once you get the hang of things -- the aiming control features a substantial amount of assistance, more than some players might want to see.  There is a basic lead indicator, which doesn't affect the course of a shot, but the automatic aiming on top of that can result in rather more spectacular kills than I think I ought to be capable of.  It's possible to peg a flying opponent with the spinfusor, for example, a feat that could only be accomplished by the ridiculously lucky in PC Tribes.  At the same time, the Dual Shock sensitivity is such that it can be difficult for snipers to tick the crosshairs into the exact right spot for a long-distance kill.  I do, however, laud the developers for giving gamers the option to pick which aiming assistance options they want in their online games.  Server administrators can select the level of assistance available in their game, from full auto-aim on down, so they can play at the level they like and in turn attract like-minded players to their servers.      That leads us to a key point about Aerial Assault.  This is an online game.  And it's not an online game in the sense that it has an online component, like SOCOM or Madden -- this is the first game sold for PlayStation 2 that is almost entirely meant to be played online.  The single-player component in Aerial Assault is a sort of missing link between a tutorial mode and a proper single-player campaign, not enough to justify the purchase price on its own.  This is not a game to buy if you're not online, and while a broadband connection isn't a requirement as it is with SOCOM, it's highly recommended.  56K players will encounter a fair amount of lag if they try to compete in bigger games, and the larger games will be all but denied to them.  Since the quality of a Tribes battle improves markedly as more and more players join, only broadband users will get the most out of this game.  Graphics Aerial Assault effectively presents the scale and visual style of Tribes maps, if not quite the level of detail we encountered in the PC games.  They're about as big as the levels in the original Tribes, although there are some designs lifted in truncated fashion from Tribes 2 -- one gets the impression that this is something like what the canned Fast Attack project would have turned out to be.  The draw distance is pretty good, with fog intruding only when it's meant to, although it's unfortunate that fog occasionally replaces the cool-looking water areas in a couple of the Tribes 2 maps.  Weapon effects in the PS2 version are quite solid, including the expected explosions and lighting effects for area-effect weapons -- there are also some nice highlighting effects on the shiny bits of the soldiers' armor.  Altogether, this is a strong visual package considering where it's coming and what it's trying to do.  The only notable problem is the occasional drop in framerate (for the most it's a solid 30 fps), and that only occurs in a very crowded shootout, or when you're trying to fly a vehicle in third-person over an enemy base.  That does, however, provide a pretty significant incentive to master first-person vehicle control.   Sound The distinctive Tribes musical style sticks around for Aerial Assault, blending medium-tempo metal with Mediterranean vocal/percussion mixes.  That actually makes a better fit than you might think -- anyway, it's better than just having one or the other.  Aerial Assault also retains all the familiar series sound effects, so you have the distinct click-whoosh of the spinfusor, the heavier whoof of the plasma gun, and that always-satisfying lock tone when a missile is ready to fly.  Directional sound isn't as significant in Tribes as it is in a more close-quarters FPS, but the stereo effects still do provide the occasional nifty sensation of moving around in a 3D space.  One very unfortunate aspect of the sound suite in Aerial Assault, however, which ties into the communication aspects of gameplay, is the absence of built-in voice communication options.  Tribes 2 on PC lets you say practically anything you'd need to as far as tactical communication with built-in communication commands.  Aerial Assault throws out almost all of that, with only affirmative and negative responses available -- you can still say ~Shazbot!~, but that's about it.  It's too bad this had to be left out, because combined with the absence of keyboard input, that makes it almost impossible to communicate in detail with other players and plan strategies.  Compared with SOCOM's detailed and flexible communication options, that's a significant failing.It's an odd accident that the PS2's first online shooters have been such distinctive affairs.  Like SOCOM, Tribes: Aerial Assault is not a straightforward deathmatch game -- it's a complex team competition with its own unique style of movement and combat.  The PS2 control setup manages to capture that style fairly well, but it will still be interesting to see how a market used to the basic run-and-gun of Goldeneye and such will adjust to spending most of their time in the air.  Hopefully, enough people will hop on board to get a self-perpetuating community going, since there's not much fun to be had with a dearth of allies and opponents online.This is certainly not a replacement for Tribes 2, then, nor is it a step forward for the series' gameplay in general, but it's a good enough introduction for console gamers, showing them what all the fuss has been about all these years.  And if you miss the ability to communicate with your teammates, well, think back to that fellow in the SOCOM game who wouldn't quit with the vomit noises...", "date": "Sep 26, 2002"}
