If you're the sort of person who wants to pay $75 for a hundred-odd hours of five-year-old RPGs packaged in a box that's too shiny to look at under bright light, you have probably already done so.  If you are not that sort of person, you are not reading this review.  Hence, if you are reading this review, you fall into one of two categories.  Either you already have the game, and are looking for a prop to hold up your own opinion, or you're an employee of Working Designs, and you're about to give me a phone call about the vaguely sarcastic tone of this lead paragraph.  Arc the Lad Collection is a nobly-intentioned piece of work, though, and the most likely knock against it -- the anachronistic nature of its market positioning -- is really missing the point.  What makes an enjoyable RPG in the eyes of serious RPG fans isn't usually much to do with graphics, as evidenced by the continuing retro interest in things like the Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games from back in the 16-bit age.  In the same way, Arc the Lad's finer points endure, even if one could come up with a really good joke juxtaposing a screenshot of Arc with a screenshot of Final Fantasy X and underlining the pair with their respective release dates.  This collection does a particularly good job of accenting one of the more unusual aspects of Arc the Lad as a series, which is its continuity.  There are a lot of lengthy series in the RPG genre, but most of them are pointedly devoid of any connection between the stories told in each installment.  Arc the Lad, on the other hand, does a very nice job of telling a connected tale from game to game, building recurring characters while also creating new heroes in each successive adventure.  Getting the whole series in one package like this underlines that quality very well, and also makes it easier to take advantage of the nifty data-importing feature.  After finishing Arc and Arc II, you can bring your save data into the subsequent games and enjoy substantially beefed-up characters on a few special occasions.  For the two of you who may be using this review as an aid to informed purchasing, then, this is a well-made set of games, one that's actually improved by the collected presentation.  And you could probably dent someone's skull with this manual, for which I offer Working Designs my sincere thanks -- most manuals, you probably couldn't even squash a bug with them.  If you'd like more details, read on for sections on all three Arc the Lad games.  Arc the Lad The original Arc the Lad, by modern standards and indeed even the standards of its time (after all, it post-dates Final Fantasy VI and the Super Famicom Dragon Quests), qualifies as RPG Lite.  Given the absence of a traditional world map and much in the way of significant dungeon-crawling or puzzle-solving, it's actually more reminiscent of a tactical combat game like the Ogre series.  Battles take place on a 2D grid, and only cinematics intervene -- you can control where you're going from time to time, but there aren't that many places to go, and the one you're supposed to go to is always clearly delineated.    As tactical combat games go, though, this one has some uncommon virtues.  It has a light-hearted personality somewhat reminiscent of the Lunar games, and while the basic premise strays a little too close to Spielbergian schmaltz (these kids are a little bit young to be out-fighting entire armies), the story never completely flubs the suspension of disbelief.  The combat system is very straightforward, with the usual positioning advantages to maneuver for, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention one of the best parts about Arc's movement system, the Jump ability.  Walls and other combatants are not necessarily a barrier to movement, provided a character has a high enough Jump attribute -- they can just hop over the obstruction at a variable penalty in movement points.  This may sound very simple, but it makes movement a fair bit easier, and watching the little superdeformoids hop over each other is great fun.  Arc also features an excellent soundtrack, particularly for the time.  Masahiro Andoh performs some of his compositions himself, but the bulk of the soundtrack features the talents of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (just recently making a return to game music with Yasunori Mitsuda's compositions for Xenosaga).  This was a great leap forward in 1995, and it still manages to hold up today, although I'd say I prefer the breadth of the Arc II music to the rather grim and moody character of the original.  The sound effects, including many voice clips that accompany battle commands, aren't quite as noteworthy now as they may once have been, but it's nice to see that WD didn't replace the voices.  Recording new snippets for Silhouette Mirage didn't do that game any good, and it wouldn't have helped here either.  Arc the Lad is of course a very short game.  You probably don't need me to tell you that you can blaze through the main quest and all of the few side-stories, with time to screw around building levels, in about 10 hours.  A dedicated gamer could be done with it in the space of a day.  But given that Arc 1's share of the MSRP amounts to maybe $15 (or less, if you manage to get the collection at a discount), that isn't really a mark against it.  After all, you have 90-odd hours left to go with the set...  Arc the Lad II This, presumably, is what the original Arc would have been with a little more time and development muscle behind it.  Arc II grafts a bigger world map, more detailed dungeons, more complex character development, a far larger cast, and most of all a longer quest onto a combat system that remains pretty familiar.  It also manages to inject a degree of non-linearity into the quest, in stark contrast to the original Arc's straight-ahead progression.    Evolving alongside its gameplay, the series' personality grows up a little here as well.  Elc, the hard-bitten bounty-hunter hero of the sequel, stands in pretty remarkable contrast to the teenaged Arc of the first game.  But then Arc himself has grown a little older and wiser in the intervening time -- that continuity I was talking about earlier becomes a factor when the entire cast of the last game arrives, most of them in playable form.  That's where one of Arc II's unique gameplay elements comes into play.  If you completed the original Arc and still have the saved game (easy enough, since you have all three games right here), you can import that save data and have revived characters with the abilities they acquired all through the original game, making them much more powerful.  Converting save data also makes several more powerful items available early in the game.  Perhaps it's not quite so much of a reward as it was in Japan, where you had to keep that save data for two years to make use of it, but it's a neat perk nonetheless.  A few toughened-up characters isn't enough to make this game easy, though, since it's a good deal more complex than its predecessor.  The original Arc had dead simple systems for equipment and spell acquisition.  Arc II almost goes overboard trying to compensate -- it lets you independently build up a character's skill with every different weapon, spell, and piece of armor, allowing for a remarkable amount of character customization depending on which bits of equipment you like.  The cast is also much larger, incorporating most of the last game's heroes and several new ones, although the active party is limited to five at a time.  Arc II's soundtrack comes from the same talents as the last, and it's as good as you'd expect, particularly thanks to some more eclectic additions.  The odd vocal theme receives the typically tuneful Working Designs treatment, and I'm quite fond of some light jazz that plays during the game's earlier movements.  Later on, the music darkens along with the story, but the variety is fun while it lasts.  What doesn't change so much is the graphical presentation.  Certainly there's a lot more of it, but were you to show someone unfamiliar with the characters screens of anything aside from the two world maps or the FMV cutscenes, they probably wouldn't be able to tell the two games apart.  Given that nearly everything else in Arc II is substantially changed for the better, though, you can't fault the developers too much for sticking to what works in the visual department.  You might also wryly note that this is still one of the better-looking sprite-based games to be released in the US, an unfortunate reminder of how the evolution of 2D graphics in this country more or less completely stalled in the mid-90s.  With that fact held particularly in mind, the only lacking aspect of Arc II's looks are the spell effects, which weren't substantially spruced up until Arc III.  Aside from its slightly dated looks, then, Arc the Lad II is an excellent RPG, and arguably the best of the series.  It's so much bigger than the original Arc as to defy comparison (running well over the 40- or 50-hour mark), features a far more detailed story (including a superb ending), and throws in plenty of optional bounty-hunting sidequests to prevent the main thrust of the plot from growing too monotonous.  Missing out on the original Arc wasn't so much of a loss for the US market -- paying the old $50 retail price for that one would have stung a little -- but it certainly would have been a shame if Arc II never came here.  Arc the Lad III Arc III is the point where the series most closely approximates the traditional visual style of a 32-bit RPG.  Translated into English, this is when it's not quite so flat and superdeformey -- the series went 3D with its third installment, and stretched out the characters a little on the vertical axis.  An unfortunate trade-off is that it's also a bit less colorful, although this is certainly the deepest of the Arc games as far as the length and breadth of its quest.  Given the choice, though, some fans actually prefer Arc II over Arc III.  The series takes some steps forward in this installment, but also moves a little ways back.  It depends on what you like, though.  What Arc III seems to be doing is moving away from its tactical roots, trying to be something more like a Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest.  The scope of battles shrinks a little, thanks to smaller battlefields and a reduced party size (4 instead of 5), and character development is boiled back down to a familiar scale, with none of Arc II's complex item experience systems.  If that suits your taste, of course, more power to you, but gamers who enjoyed the nitty-gritty gameplay elements of Arc II may be disappointed.  The save-conversion system remains, one of Arc II's finer points held over for another go.  The involvement of past characters in the series is a little sparser in this game (particularly surprising is the absence of Arc himself, at least until the very end), but there are still plenty of cameos to remind you of past adventures.  That helps carry what perhaps isn't such a strong story as the first two Arcs, which taken as a whole are quite the epic.  That's not to say this isn't an effective tale, particularly considering the potentially clumsy structure it's built around, but it pales a little in comparison.  The structure I'm referring to is the massive series of bounty-hunting quests, which make up the vast bulk of Arc III's gameplay.  You could describe the whole game as a series of tasks, numbering them in order up to over 100.  Thinking somewhat objectively, perhaps Arc III is just putting a set of labels on the way any RPG scenario is designed these days (go there, do this, repeat a few dozen times), but nevertheless, I still get the feeling that the game is laid out rather by rote.  Mind playing tricks on me, perhaps.  Arc III is certainly not devoid of improvements on the series formula, anyway.  The item-experience development system is gone, as mentioned before, but it's replaced by a method for creating your own items and weapons, and combat gets a dash of spice through a card-based summoning system, adapting and improving upon a similar system in Arc II.  One character has the ability to capture monsters, store five at a time, and bring them out to aid the party in combat -- yeah, I know what you're thinking, but questions of originality aside, it's a fun system, adding a new element to the mix in both battles and quests.  Whether or not you prefer it to Arc II, Arc III is still a well-done RPG, and it does handle a few aspects of presentation unquestionably better than its predecessors.  It has the nicest cutscenes of the series by far, and the best voice clips as well.  And after the amount of gameplay you'll have gotten out of the collection at this point, it's hard to say you've been cheated.  Extra Stuff Which is a pretty big heading, covering everything from these Dual Shock stick-cover things to Arc Arena Monster Tournament, the monster battle and mini-game collection originally released as a companion to Arc II.  But the whole package gets a thumbs up, unless you have some kind of rabid aversion to the sort of widgets Working Designs is so fond of packing in with its games.  Monster Tournament (originally ~Monster Game With Casino Game~ or something similarly cumbersome) is more or less just that.  It's tied to Arc II, and specifically the character Lieza, the one who has the ability to command monsters.  You can import your monster collection from the game, or start with a stock selection of beasts, and fight to the top of a Pokemon-style tournament.  Essentially, it's Pokemon Stadium with Arc the Lad monsters, with the one caveat that you have no active control over your combatants.  You train them and outfit them, but don't give them commands (think AI System in Virtua Fighter 4).  It's presented properly here as an extra -- it would have been a bit of a raw deal bought on its own, but as part of this collection it works just fine.  Everything else?  Well, nothing really tops the Lucia pendant from Lunar 2, and the standees in Arc invariably pale before the ones in Lunar simply thanks to Game Arts' cooler character designs, but the memory card case is nice, and the stick-covers amusingly silly.  As I say, though, be careful not to look at the box under strong light. Phew.  Had enough yet?There, perhaps, is the one potential drawback to this collection.  It's a whole heck of a lot of Arc the Lad, and while Arc the Lad is good, consuming too much Arc the Lad over a short period of time could prove unpleasant.  The author has certainly gone through spells where he felt like comparing the package to a five-gallon bucket of Cream of Wheat -- yes, that's a lot of Cream of Wheat, and Cream of Wheat isn't so bad with some brown sugar and raisins in it, but do you really want to eat that much Cream of Wheat?But if you're an ordinary gamer rather than a scumbag journalist on deadline, and you don't mind graphics that are just a touch behind the cutting edge, you should get plenty of mileage out of Arc the Lad Collection.  Working Designs has done its fanbase a kind service with this one, and in exceptionally classy style -- the translation from beginning to end is thoroughly readable and pleasantly restrained.And hey, if you get too frustrated, you can always take out some of your aggressions with that manual...", "date": "May 6, 2002"}
