It has moved far beyond its early 32-bit Earthworm Jim days. The Laguna Hills, CA-based company contracted out EJ to VIS in the UK to bring the squiggly worm to 3D. Games like Stunt Copter, Messiah, and MDK are proof of the company's maturation and ability to move on to new, fresh ideas.   At least in theory.  Wild 9 is, if you will, the last remnant of Shiny's Earthworm Jim days, even though it has nothing to do with the game. Created in 1995 or '96, Wild 9 is in full 3D, with polygonal characters and environments, texture maps, animated backgrounds, and loads of light effects. While it looks like a 3D game, it moves in a completely 2D world. In many ways when playing this title, you will feel striking similarities to EJ. Not a bad thing, but certainly not a fluke coincidence either.  Having said all that, Wild 9 is a fun, 2D platform game with, as Shiny President Dave Perry says, ~a hook.~ The main character Wex has a 'rig' on his right arm protruding a beam that enables him to manipulate enemies or objects, and in this game, he makes best use of it by torturing the hell out of his enemies.   And it's a blast. You can bash them on the ground, throw them in spiked pits and watch them slowly die, hurl them into giant furnaces, or decapitate them. Wex must save the rest of the Wild 9 in order to reach the end and face the final boss. What's really great is that you can do this and feel good about it, too, because you must in order to progress through the game, and the characters aren't human or realistic. Thus, a parent wouldn't have to feel guilty about letting their seven-year-old play it...  Well, anyway, the game is packed with about 10 levels, enabling Wex to pass swing, jump, and torture his way through keyhole-based puzzles, and other, more interesting rig-based obstructions.  The game supports both dual analog and force-feedback, is packed with dynamic sound and great effects, and is constructed with lots of early hints and a smooth, easy-to-use interface.I like this game a lot. I know it's no Quake 2, with its flash and speed, but I don't care. With all of this mediocre 3D stuff packing shelves (like Fifth Element, for instance), Wild 9 makes strange sense. Plus, I miss the days when I could pour salt on snails or blow pieces of crap up with fire crackers; Wild 9 settles my punky little adolescent urges (of which I seem to have more than I knew) with an evil flair. And no people or animals get hurt.Shiny beefed up this game tremendously since the last time we saw it. The game's final status is power-packed. The sound is high quality, all of the characters are cool looking and the moving and non-moving background animations are the products of mad creation and the detail-oriented fiends at Shiny, and the hard rock music is conducive to torture  in a good way.Most hard-core will finish the game fast, but for the general masses, it'll provide a nice bit of classic gaming with all of the most current, and trendy, bells and whistles.For me, this is good fun, and it's a wide ranging game that many can appreciate.", "date": "Oct 2, 1998"}
