Safari Rescue Review", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/04/go-diego-go-safari-rescue-review-3", "text": "While us grown-ups are playing No More Heroes and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, our kids, nieces and nephews, and little cousins need games to play, too.  That's where something like Go, Diego, Go! Safari Rescue comes in.  Publisher Take2 has released a competent, simple little game that capitalizes on the children's property and makes good use of the Wii Remote.  There are places where the developers skimped on production values, but for the most part this is a good choice for preschool gamers.   You're probably familiar with Diego, the Dora the Explorer off-shoot who rescues animals and speaks a bit of Spanish.  Safari Rescue extends the feel of the cartoon and features the voice of Jake T. Austin, the main actor from the series.  It's a very easy 2D action game that only uses one button on the Wii Remote.  Held in the horizontal position, players tilt the controller to move Diego and use the 2 button for actions like jumping and investigating.  I have to admit I like the mechanic of tilting to move and would like to see this implemented in a more mature 2D platformer.   The story is downright bizarre, involving a mosquito who lands on a magic wand and is turned into a magician.  She decides she doesn't like elephants and turns them all into giant boulders.  Diego and his posse find a magic drum to reverse the spell and must traverse the African expanse to set things right.  It's the sort of adventure only the twisted mind of a four-year-old can really appreciate, I suppose.   Gameplay varies from level to level.  Sometimes Diego will need to maneuver across different African environments, jumping over boulders and searching for Safari Stamps in bushes.  Sometimes he'll use his Rescue Pack to create useful modes of transportation like hot air balloons and mud boards.  Sometimes he'll ride Erin the Elephant and knock over trees.  There are 13 different Wiimote gestures used to perform different actions during the game.  It's nice to see all this variety in what could have been a cheap cash-in on an existing license.   While every part of the game is easy to understand, the controls are fluid and I think kids will find it fun to play.  It's fun bouncing Diego around on trampolines, using all of his gadgets, and steering his vehicles.  While the lack of depth would be a detriment to us old folks, considering the game's target market it is actually it's greatest asset.     One of the areas that could have used a bit more effort is the cut scenes.  Instead of being animated like the TV show they're based on, they consist of still images panned around the screen.  It looks a little cheap.  In-game graphics are cel-shaded and look nice enough but I also would have liked to see a little more animation for the characters.  When a group gathers to discuss the pressing issues of Diego's life the camera zooms out to get everyone in frame.  It can be hard to tell who is talking as they perform only the slightest movements when speaking and they're voices sound similar.   The music is well-done, sounding like it could have been lifted right from the cartoon from what I've heard while visiting my three year old nephew.  Hints of African instruments and melodies drift along bouncy ditties that fit the lighthearted mood of the game.  The Wii Remote speaker is also used for a variety of sound effects, from collecting items to receiving a call from Diego's sister Alicia on his video watch.Too often ~games for kids~ turn into ~games for idiots.~  While younger players aren't ready to grasp the controls and gameplay mechanics of most games out there, they still deserve a fun, engaging experience that developers have put some thought into.  Go, Diego, Go! Safari Rescue is a nice-looking game that will engage fans of the TV show.  It doesn't raise the bar for videogames as a medium, but it isn't trying to.  It aims to be a pleasant diversion for preschoolers, and to that end it is successful.", "date": "Mar 4, 2008"}
