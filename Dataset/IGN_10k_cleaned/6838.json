In this newest iteration, developer Telltale Games gives us 5 cases to solve.  This is more of the same goodness previous CSI games have given us, with engrossing storylines and gameplay that actually makes forensic analysis seem interesting - something the TV show has in spades.   Players start out as a rookie assigned the Las Vegas Crime Lab working the graveyard shift.  At first, only one case is available to play through.  When that is solved, the next one is unlocked.  Cases can be repeated at will after that.  At the end of each investigation, Gil Grissom evaluates success based upon the number of evidence items that were found and how many hints were needed to solve the case.  Find all the evidence and don't request any hints and a master ranking awaits.  Unlike in previous games, though, there's no cool artwork or unlockables awarded for reaching the master status, so there's no real reason to play through the game again.  There are three difficulty settings or players can set a custom level of difficulty, selecting five different options to make gameplay easier (or harder if you really like pain).  Players can turn off hot spots for navigation or for tools, tagging for evidence or location or the tool assist system.  Turning off the hotspots would mean needing to pay very special attention to everything on the screen and probably clicking in random spots looking for evidence.  Turning off tagging would mean you don't know when you've exhausted all there is to do with a piece of evidence or at a location.  Tool assist highlights the tools you may be able to use, so there's not a lot of guesswork involved.  I love a good challenge as much as the next person, but using the extra tools doesn't affect final ranking, so why put yourself through the trouble?     The cases themselves are engrossing, much like the television shows.  This is one pitch these games always hit out of the park.  And what is an adventure game without a great story?  A stink bomb.  The cases progress fairly linearly, taking us through a couple misleading suspects before finally revealing the true culprit.  As is standard fare in these games, if you think you know who did it, pick one of the other guys.  In the case of 3 Dimensions of Murder, I was particularly enamored with the second case, appropriately named First Person Shooter and pays homage to being employed in the game industry.  Let me just tell you now that everything Maya says about the industry and being a woman in it - absolutely true.  Preach on sista.   The gameplay is engrossing, to a point.  There is some pixel hunting involved in certain areas, but the evidence is fairly obvious at most times.  Even trace evidence like fingerprints, hair, semen, blood and powders are clearly visible.  I've never been a fan of 'slowly move the mouse across the screen to find the tiny hotspot' adventure games, so CSI gets a thumbs up for this element.  Once evidence is collected, many things may be necessary to fully process it.  Some items have further evidence on them, like a bottle might have a fingerprint.  Some may need to be analyzed or compared in the labs various computers.  Further items might need to be placed on the assembly table, used to put together scraps of paper or disassemble guns for instance.  Once all the evidence in one spot is found, the hotspot disappears, so you'll know you've accomplished everything necessary.  There are some red herrings, but the CSI accompanying you will let you know there's nothing to be done in those spots.   The other element of gameplay outside of the forensic investigation is witness and suspect interviews.  There aren't any stoppers put in like other games have done.  Simply continue asking questions until all the dialogue has been asked.  In all cases, every suspect will need to be interviewed multiple times.  Once enough evidence has been collected, Brass can obtain search warrants, bring suspects in for interrogation, and finally, arrest the culprit for the awful crime they have committed.       Graphics are the same as they have been in prior games.  The likenesses of the characters from the show are present and recognizable.  Lip syncing animation is still rough, but passable.  The Vegas flyover scenes are present.  If there was one thing I'd love to see them add to the line-up for CSI titles, it would be emotion in the faces.  The voice often doesn't match the expression.  Oh, and please shorten or eliminate load times.  They aren't atrociously long, but they are frequent.  Finally, some of the graphics were a little too real (what a terrible complaint huh?).  I won't give it away, but there is one particular scene I could have done without - you'll know it when you see it.  Ew.   The voice acting, though, is phenomenal.  A lot of the actors from the Thursday night drama voiced their characters, and for the suspects (and cast members from the show who didn't participate), the voice actors are very solid.  All text in the game is spoken, so subtitles can be turned off for a more immersive experience.  This is probably a good idea if you are a perfectionist, because while the typos are few, there are a couple. The music is solid and sound effects are good.  At the end of the day, and the game, I felt satisfied.  I feel they've really hit upon the right combination of case length and number of cases.  It's just long enough, but not too long.  That's not to say that die-hard fans won't wish there was more.  But there's enough to sate and it doesn't feel like it ends prematurely.  I do, again, wish there were some unlockables to give me a reason to go back and play a couple of the cases I didn't master.  But in the end, it doesn't really matter.  Fascinating stories, great twists, good graphics, superior voice acting, decent gameplay and the desire to now become a CSI once again is what we are left with.  And that is good enough.", "date": "Apr 13, 2006"}
