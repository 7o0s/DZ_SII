Everything from Spiderwick to Golden Compass to Berenstein Bears Wear Witch Hats is an attempt to capture the imaginations of millions of impressionable children. The Spiderwick Chronicles is the latest cinematic attempt and while the movie itself at least tries, its mobile counterpart fails miserably.   Following the movie's story (I never read the books), you take turns playing as the three Grace children: Jared, Simon and Mallory. Your quest is to protect the Spiderwick Chronicles from being seized by trolls. Most of the game takes place inside the house where the book is kept. Controlling one of three characters at any time, you solve riddles in a very linear attempt at advancing the storyline. The game's tasks range from finding honey in the kitchen to picking up a baseball bat and hitting trolls with it.    Each character can hold up to four items. Anything extra will have to be stored in a chest. The inventory management system is extremely confusing and cumbersome for such a simple game. Only certain characters use certain items. Click the right soft key and then press left to bring up your backpack. It's here where you can choose your item by pressing 5 to equip it. Then press the left soft key to exit. You can only use one item at a time. For instance, you receive a fencing medal that adds life to people wearing it, but it doesn't do you much good if you can't arm yourself with a bat as well so there's really no reason to ever wear the medal.   Press the right soft key and up and you look around with the game giving you a clue or merely telling you what's happening on screen. Press Right for the talk icon, and you receive information as to what you're supposed to be doing next. I used this feature quite a bit because I always forgot what I was supposed to be doing when I had to come back to the game later.   Control the kids using the directional pad and pressing 5 or the center key lets you swing your bat or stick or whatever other weapon you pick up. You're only going to be using your weapon when trolls are around -- with the only exception being in the beginning of the game when you need to break down a wall. You probably have to use a weapon to beat the last guy, but since the game refuses to give me any sort of clue or hint as to how to beat him, I hit the end boss with a baseball bat about 50 times before giving up on the game.   And that's a big problem with Spiderwick. A lot of times you're not sure what it is you're really supposed to be doing. Sure, the game will tell you that you need to find honey or some other sort of mundane task, but if you're not paying attention, you'll run over the item you need to pick up without ever realizing it. Luckily, the game does say 'pick up item' or something along those lines when you do run over the thing you're looking for.     But Spiderwick's shortcoming cannot compare to its biggest fault and that's the loading screen. Every five seconds it seems a loading screen will pop up. Every single time you enter a new room, you get to look at a loading screen. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And since the rooms and environments are so small you're not standing in one for a very long time. Walking to the front yard if you're in a bedroom nets your around four loading screens before you get there. It's perhaps the most annoying thing I've ever seen in a mobile game. Even if Chronicles was a perfect game, I'd knock it down about a million points because my patience ran so thin having to look at loading screens more than I was looking at the actual game.   Storyline follows the movie closely, even hinting at the kids' displeasure at their father for leaving them, but it was unnecessary for the game. The graphics were done very well and the kids, trolls and environment were very colorful and nicely detailed. The music was whimsical but you'll turn it off in about five seconds once you realize whimsical music is for sissies. I just can't recommend Spiderwick even for fans of the books and movie. The tedious nature of having to sit through loading screens will tax even the most patient gamer. Even though it looks nice, the adventure itself isn't exciting and the game play is very generic and boring. Skip this one and look for your mobile fantasy fix elsewhere.", "date": "Mar 18, 2008"}
