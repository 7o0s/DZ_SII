{"name": "Mega Man Anniversary Collection", "name_review": "Mega Man Anniversary Collection", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/06/17/mega-man-anniversary-collection-4", "text": "Though the current generation has already seen its fair share of old-school compilation sets with games like Activision Anthology and Midway Arcade Treasures, few of them have ever focused on anything other than the pre-NES days of the early 80s. So while a legion of gamers out there have already experienced Pole Position and Pac-Man in a million different ways, a significantly smaller number of users have yet to partake in efforts like Clash at Demonhead, Faxanadu, or The Adventures of Lolo. Unfortunately our gut instinct tells us that this type of situation isn't going to change anytime soon, but at least Capcom's first PS2 omnibus known as Mega Man Anniversary Collection gives us some legitimized hope.   But the reason that Mega Man leaves us so optimistic in the first place, however, isn't quite for the reason you'd first think. As instead of finding ourselves overly nostalgic and permissive towards Capcom's famous mascot because of the memories he's given us, we're alternatively impressed by how well he holds up against today's more elaborate competitors. To be truthful, the impact of it all is really quite shocking; as it's not the remembrance of deep gameplay and imaginative characters that make the Anniversary Collection so enjoyable, it's the reality of it.   Not only does Mega Man Anniversary Collection manage to bring us all the great classics that helped put the NES on the map with Mega Man 1 thru 6, it also treats us to a handful of SNES, PlayStation, and Arcade titles as well. Mega Man 7, Mega Man 8, and the previously unreleased Power Battle and Power Fighters really illustrate how far the Blue Bomber has come since his inception in 1987. But what really enhances the experience further is how the developer Atomic Planet has gone in and re-tooled certain aspects without destroying what made the games so entertaining in the first place.   Click for more images Mega Man 1, for instance, is still as difficult as it's always been and remains mechanically identical to its original NES counterpart (in fact it could be even harder since exploiting the Pause Button/Thunder Beam glitch against the yellow devil no longer applies). But rather than leave the game as is, Atomic Planet has also incorporated several elements from the PlayStation's Mega Man 8 to speed up gameplay and keep some consistency between the titles. More specifically, the shoulder button-controlled quick navigational tool can now be used for all eight Mega Man adventures, which allows players to cycle through all of their robot master weapons without having to go into a separate menu to do so.   Another new addition is the rapid fire button for the NES versions of the series. Allowing players to hold the button down for three shots in succession rather than using manually controlled single taps, the auto-fire is particularly handy against airborne opponents and speedier bad guys. The great thing about this little extra is that you don't have to use it if you don't want too; so hardcore old-school purists can stick with the same single-fire techniques that helped them muscle through the originals if they choose too. At least it's there if you need it. Fortunately, the programmers didn't go overboard with the mechanical enhancements, as other eventual gameplay maneuvers like slides and weapon charges have been kept exclusively for games in which they originally appeared. What this means is that you won't be sliding before Mega Man 3 and you won't be charging before Mega Man 4. That decision keeps all eight of the included platformers pretty balanced with little more than an added touch of functionality; though it should be noted that for the first time ever, the difficulty setting and starting lives count for all eight games can finally be adjusted via the options menu. Cool.    But just because Capcom didn't change the gameplay very much doesn't mean that it didn't take this opportunity to leave the aesthetics unaffected. Including both original and remixed versions of each title, Atomic Planet has incorporated what's known as ~Navi Mode~ so that players looking for something a little different can find it. And while Navi Mode won't change environmental blueprints or enemy layouts like most other videogame remixes do (thankfully so, as the Mega Man series has always had one of the strongest 8-bit designs) it will change the user interface so that it matches Mega Man 8. Menus, weapon selects, and other such goodies all have updated artwork and players can also receive tips from Mega Man's cohorts complete with animated portraits with a simple tap of the select button. Best of all, Navi Mode also kicks off remixed soundtracks for Mega Man 1 thru 7, the likes of which kick ass all over the original tunes. Nice!   To reward players for finishing each of the included Mega Man games, Capcom has also provided several bits of bonus content that should keep fans busy between play sessions. Sadly these extras aren't quite as extensive as something like Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, though, they do include such unlockables as artwork, historical information, and platform-specific goodies for PS2 and GameCube users (a full-length animated episode of Mega Man for PS2 users, and producer interviews for Cube fans). And of course, the previously mentioned pair of arcade fighting games is thrown in for good measure.   Perhaps the news that will please the fans most of all, however, is that Atomic Planet has cleared up all the glitches we complained about in our preview just a few weeks ago. Load times are down considerably (about 10 to 15 seconds from the menu to each individual game with no loading after that) and slowdown and flicker from the original cart versions have been almost entirely eliminated (it's still in there, but it's only noticeable a few times per game). Consider us relieved.Though we'll concede that the pair of bonus fighting games are a little on the weak side, It's otherwise hard to find criticisms for Mega Man Anniversary Collection that aren't inherent to the genre. Yes it's dated and nowhere near as complex as the majority of today's action/platform games, and it doesn't boast a series of elaborate cut scenes or extensive voice overs either (with the exception of Mega Man 8, of course). But when all is said and done, does any of that really matter? Truthfully, no. Because what Mega Man Anniversary lacks in technology and convolution, it more than makes up for in mechanical brilliance, loveable characters, a compelling art direction, and an abundance of robotic charm.Make no two bones about it, Mega Man Anniversary Collection is one of the best anthology sets we've seen for any platform so far (even if it is a little light in the game count compared to other retro throwbacks like Intellivision Lives and Activision Anthology). Throw in the fact that is has a suggested retail price of less than thirty bucks, a nice amount of bonus content, and the right dose of enhancements to an already strong lineup of games, and it's hard to imagine our GameCube and PlayStation 2 libraries without it.", "date": "Jun 17, 2004"}
