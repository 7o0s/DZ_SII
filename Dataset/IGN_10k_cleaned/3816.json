Its games all revolved around racing and stunts of some kind, including Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX 2, Splashdown and Star Wars Racer Revenge.    Acquired by the cash-rich THQ in 2002, however, Rainbow has been quiet up until now. With Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild, it has developed its first full-blown THQ game.    An unofficial sequel to the Infogrames published Splashdown, Rides Gone Wild offers gamers a rich, technically savvy watercraft racing game, replete with stunts, secret courses, and the finely tuned sim-arcade balance inherent to all Rainbow games. In other words, the game is designed more or less as a simulation and is then toned down, rounded out, tuned and balanced into an relatively easy-to-pick up racing game for nearly everybody.    Rides Gone Wild is probably the most accessible of all Rainbow's games, often feeling like ATV Off-road Fury 1 & 2 on water, and without a doubt challenging -- meaning it requires patience to learn the trick system, memorize the courses and, overall, a firm sense of discipline.    But after a multitude of poor-playing watercraft and Jetski games, many gamers have become shy with anything including ~jetski~ or ~watercraft~ in it. Do gamers really want another extreme-sport watercraft racer? And, if a game of this nature cannot out-perform the still-impressive Nintendo 64 Wave Race 64, what's the point? Perhaps that's looking too far back or maybe it's asking too much, but for those of us who've played all of these games, both good and bad, it's a concern.   Gameplay  Which means Rides Gone Wild is probably the next best thing to Nintendo's classic, at least in this gamer's mind. On the bright side, Rides Gone Wild plays nearly identical to the original Splashdown -- generally considered a good thing. Every little thing that made the first title excellent is intact: Superb water physics, a sense of immediate, finesse handling, a wide variety of courses and, in them, an impressive set of secret pathways.    What Rainbow has done to improve and expand in the Splashdown universe is multi-fold. The game has gone through what looks like, at first glance, a THQ conversation. My first impression was ~It's Kidsville.~ The courses have undergone a massive transformation into rollercoaster-style rides, and, more to the point, they resemble distinct Disneyland rides. If you have ridden the Pirates of the Caribbean, the Haunted Mansion, the Indiana Jones Adventure or anything else in the park, you will undoubtedly recognize these. So, do you want to ride through these style courses on a watercraft?   Insider Splashdown: RGW Want to learn the nitty-gritty about this racer?

Download it Now! |     What's most impressive, however, is the degree to which they animate, morph and shift on the fly. Every course offers an immense level of motion and change. In Cannonball Cove, cannonball scripts bombard the courses with shots, landing around your craft and creating waves, splashes and creating a sense of excitement to the otherwise sane course. Later in that level, a cannonball creates a breach in a pirate ship, creating a new shortcut through its hull. Polar Plunge, the mandatory ice level, offers constantly shifting icebergs, creating narrow shafts in which to maneuver, and a multitude of last-minute ramps, alternative paths and breakable objects. Racers can gun through ice and snow barriers blasting them into an array of shiny particles, leap 20-30 feet into the air, or pass through narrow, winding S-turns. In Downtown Downpour, racers race through a storm, and the flooded city changes at the very last second, requiting split-second decisions.    The list of courses and the immense amount of transformative environments is impressive, especially given the generally consistent framerate of 30 FPS. In this sense, it's as much fun to watch as it is to play. The technical courses and the freestyle courses are certainly worth a look, with ramp systems and loop courses cleanly designed and arranged for maximum jumps and speed.    The shortcomings to the courses are minimal, but they exist. Every so often players will ascend up a ramp, and the camera, shown from the third-person perspective, fails to offer enough of a view down the course to make one feel comfortable, or in some cases to see much of anything. Though it's a not really a major fault, the ceilings and walls are strangely lower and narrower than expected in many areas. The result is that ramps often can potentially heave players into walls or ceilings, ruining a perfectly good set of tricks and, what's worse, depleting one's Performance Meter. Sometimes the currents and enemy AI will shove players into similar situations too. Is that good AI? Perhaps, but it's also annoying AI.   The game offers a broader range of modes, tricks and ways to upgrade. Players can enter into six modes of play, an outdoor Career mode (with eight tracks), an technique-based indoor Career mode (with 12 courses), Technical Trials, Freestyle, Career and Vs mode, each of which offer eight to 12 courses of their own. The extensive training session is very helpful in teaching the basic, intermediate and advanced tricks, and for those who want to unlock everything or at least win a season in pro mode, they MUST learn the secondary and tertiary tricks.      The trick system has expanded, which now provides a beefier, deeper experience. Players can now pull off tricks independent of the craft as well as craft based vehicles. For example, players can complete a level 1 nac-nac and then link it to a level 2 handlebar handstand, after which they can finish the trick with a level 3 whirlybird or metronome.   The trick system is mechanical in nature, and is, by no means, as fluid or as arcade-like as the one found in Wave Race 64 (though there are far more tricks to pull off). Pulling off tricks is easy enough, but it's crystal clear that while Rainbow's design doc features a healthy set of shortcuts, the designers never swerve in how they want players to play the game. They are no power-ups to be found anywhere, which means players must constantly increase their speed by pulling off tricks to power their Performance Meter. Repeat tricks earn less, and in the Pro level of competition, players need to maintain at least two bars in their Performance Meter.   Is this wrong? Nah. Is it a narrow design? Maybe. But it IS a pure trick system. It just means players do not have an alternative way of increasing speed; they have to perform tricks. So, if gamers just want a clean, straight race in Rides Gone Wild, they're pretty much up a creek without a paddle. Of course, there is Time Trial and Technical Time Trial for those folks, but Career Mode is at the game's heart.   Another addition I do like is the increased wave action. Depending on the track, waves play a more prominent part in the game's design. The break down into three kinds: continuous small sets, long rolling middle size waves, and large ones. The smaller ones are easy to skip over, the medium ones provide enough vertical space to pull off single stunts, and the larger ones, if players' rhythm is synchronized, can produce enough air to pull off a two- or even three-tier stunt. Of course, at any time players can duck dive and jump out to give themselves air too. The increased wave action is needless to say appreciated and very cool.    Lastly, there are several things I wish would have been improved: The load times, the Career system and the upgrade system. The load times are long and numerous. Players will experience them between courses, ranging from 20-30 seconds, at the beginning of the game and during pretty much every spot possible. They're not horrible, but they borderline horrible. We expect more from Rainbow! You guys are savvy PS2 experts!    In the same line of thinking as the trick system is the progression system. Players are given a minimum amount of continues, about three, and if they lose a race, or want to start over, they must use it to continue. The idea is to encourage players to learn the trick system and master it to progress -- and to jump around in the game to play all of the various modes. Fair enough, but if players enter the Pro level they'll often find themselves having to start an entire career over after having only a few bad races. This can happen because of the deft AI has shoved a rider off a ramp, bumped it into an obstacle or because of a overhanging thingy smacking the rider in the head and backward off his craft, plopping him squarely into fifth place. The system isn't terrible, but it's not lenient and it will indeed frustrate gamers. No doubt.     Lastly, while there are tons of things to purchase, riders and bikes to unlock, from what I have experienced, the new bikes don't mean better, faster, cooler bikes, but just newer looking ones. Also, why, after a race is complete, does it offer you the choice to retry or ~Quit~? Shouldn't it say ~Continue?~ There are some often smaller complaints, too, such as static between menus, sound blips that appear during transitions between menus, and once, the game simply crashed on me.    Graphics  Visually, what Rides Gone Wild shows off more than anything is a frenzied, animated design. It's a wild ride to be sure, filled with heavily scripted events, moving objects and an utterly unmatched water system. The sheer amount of animated events is impressive, but it's the range of things that change, whether it's a downpour of rain or the breaking bridge in Downhill Downpour to the explosions and churning water systems in Wild West/grand Canyon level, which make it unique. It's a visually impressive game, whether one is addressing backgrounds, the water or the animations.    While the progressive scan is a little wacky (the HUD and text is a little stretch), players can choose in options to turn it off.    The water is beautiful, with numerous layers of textures, constant motion, and waves that respond in realistic ways. What's more is that in this sequel players experience more spray, rain, rooster tails and collateral water splashing the screen. This, to an extent, even provides visual obstacles, which is a good thing). The only weak point in the visual design is that the character animations are decent and the models are generic. While it's always fun to have likeable characters, it's not as crucial as say the water physics system or a highly functioning trick system. What makes the characters weak, however, isn't their looks, it's what they say.     Sound  Yeah, the characters offer up an array of terribly lame one-liners, creating a cast of dislikable and dumb racers. The unlockable ones are sillier than the first initial cast, but they too delivery some of the corniest lines around -- or just plain insulting ones. The recent Downhill Domination did its vocals best, offering a sort of subliminal chorus of people being disturbed, disrupted by or being startled by the riders cruising through their home, church or backyard. They all sort of murmured things, none of which were terribly funny by themselves, but collectively they created a humorous vibe. So yeah, plainly put, the script in Rides Gone Wild is weak sauce.   Second, there are numerous gauges enabling players to alternate voice, SF, music and more, and there is an option for Stereo and Dolby Pro Logic II, which simply increases the overall sound quality, given the right speakers.    Musically, it fares better. Rather than lacing the game with a parade of licensed ~alternative~ and hardcore songs, all of which we've probably heard too much or have never heard, Rainbow Studios scored its game with a handful of original tunes. They're different and because of that, I like them. It's strange at first to hear a simulated orchestra thundering with dramatic flair in the background, but it's pulled off and well. The songs are entirely original because if one listens carefully in the Venetician level there's a hint of James Bond thrown in, or in the Wild West level, players can pick out the Blazing Saddles theme song, but they're all thrown into a cover-band collage that changes as events in the course occur.Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild is a different kind of sequel than we've seen from Rainbow Studios. It's bigger and better the way a sequel should be, but it's also more colorful, more accessible and more friendly -- looking, at least -- than any other games the company has developed on PlayStation 2. The trick system is solid, the courses dynamic, and the experience is a terse, challenging one, creating an overall positive affect. Some fans of the previous game won't like the highly decorative new courses, or the attempt at appealing to a large market with Disneyland-like courses. But the object of making games is to make ones that sell to the most amount of people, and Rainbow is trying its hand at expanding. There is nothing particularly wrong with Splashdown: Rides Gone Wild. It's fast, offers an exceptional watercraft ride -- the best on PS2 by a long shot -- and it's packed to the gills with tricks, modes and replay value. Like previous Rainbow games, it's more sim than arcade in play and more mechanical than fluid in feel. But it's the developer's most accessible and friendliest game to date, and it works. So, simply put, if you want a technically crafted watercraft racer based on a sophisticated trick system, get it. If you loved Wave Race 64 like I did, you'll most definitely want to give it a thorough playing.", "date": "Aug 5, 2003"}
