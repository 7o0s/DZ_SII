{"name": "Headhunter", "name_review": "Headhunter", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/05/14/headhunter", "text": "In my final days at our much beloved and retired Dreamcast channel, one of the last great titles headed for the system was Sega's Headhunter. A mix of B-movie storytelling and high-end visuals, Headhunter was shaping up to be something special, but alas I never knew it. And by the time it came our way, I was so far removed from anything DC, that the European and Japanese versions were all but forgotten. A game that never was, I moved on.   Almost two years later with Headhunter almost a distant memory, I was pleased to find out that we'd be getting it in North America after all. Intrigued and determined to find out if Amuze's creation would in fact live up to the hype and promises made long ago, I eagerly dove into the experience to search for the truth. Happily, what I found was worth the effort.   Story  Set in an undisclosed future vision of Southern California, Headhunter follows the exploits of ex-lawman Jack Wade. Subjected to mysterious testing in an undisclosed lab, Jack loses his memory and status as a government sanctioned bounty hunter. After a narrow escape from the clutches of the nameless scientists, Jack awakens in a hospital face to face with his old boss. After a couple of rather large cutscenes slowly revealing that Jack has been blacklisted by the agency that employed him, our hero decides to go freelance, and that's where the plot really thickens.    Angela Stern, daughter of the assassinated political figure Christopher Stern, approaches Jack (who's still in the hospital) with a proposition. Find and kill the person responsible for her father's demise, and a cool 2 million bucks is his for the taking. Equipped with a heavy dose of background info, a new motorcycle, and a sleek pair of sunglasses courtesy of the lovely miss Stern, Jack's adventure begins.   And what an adventure it is. Rife with side switching, plot twists, and unexpected revelations, Headhunter's story is top notch. It's as though someone removed all the good parts from a collection of Steven Segal and Jean-Claude Van Damme movies and spliced them together with a vocal talent that can actually act. Engaging, adult, and never dumbed down, Headhunter's backbone is its biggest strength.   Gameplay  A solid engine for action to be sure, Headhunter's gameplay is very reminiscent of other espionage titles like WinBack and Syphon Filter. Your basic sneak, shoot, and sprint method of gameplay, the tried and true formula seen in past genre games like Tomb Raider and Shadow Man makes for a winning combination. Unlike the aforementioned games however, jumping has been completely removed from the equation. Which means that the awkward fumbling around when trying to get to higher locations is completely eliminated. To weasel your way into hard to reach spots in Headhunter, you either walk up to it or climb through it. Either way, the responsive analog control scheme is a breeze.   Not to say that there aren't any problems when manipulating action mode. While a simple press of the square button will cycle through different targets to shoot, getting the thing to land on the guy you want to kill is another story entirely. A tad heavy when switching from target to target, the aiming feature pauses briefly before switching in the right direction. Unfortunately this usually results in Jack taking a couple of shots he shouldnt in the interim. Luckily, rolling around in a crouch and strapping yourself ninja-like against flat surfaces can help keep the damage to a minimum.   Another concern I had was with piloting your motorcycle. A necessity when trying to earn skill points to raise your abilities and weapons, driving your hog through downtown at high speeds is extremely difficult. While I can respect the fact that the more you race, the more effective a driver you become, I can't figure out why the motorcycle aspect is so unbalanced. Crashing, losing control, and similar haphazards mean nothing, as there are no cool animations to illustrate such an event or a consequence to missions or health. Simply bump into a building or car at 100 mph and you bounce off; ready to keep on driving and wobbling throughout the city. Kind of cool in the beginning, the repetition of mayhem without results was a little disappointing.   Not to say that playing through the game as a whole isn't enjoyable. Powered by Resident Evil-like puzzles, there's a lot of simple but fun ~go here and there with this special key~ type scenarios which actually make sense when presented to you. Blasting bad guys and bosses are both action-packed and strategic, and while there are a few dull moments between story points, the pacing is pretty spot-on. Taking Headhunter for what it is, there's few titles in the genre that play as effectively.     Graphics  Top of the line on Dreamcast, the PlayStation 2 version of Headhunter is still a beauty to look at. The character models especially are a marvel, with the main characters in particular standing out as justifiable personalities. Although the supporting cast boasts a somewhat lifeless expression and few animations, there's enough of a combination between the players that keep the visuals believable.   Special effects like rain, bullet holes in the walls, and some convincing explosion graphics add to the package, while the cutscenes throw in an added array of shadows and lighting tricks to intensify the movie-like feel. Sadly, some of the bitmap textures that have been pasted onto object models look like just that, fat old bitmaps. And slight camera problems when whipping around pillars and poles will confuse you just enough to get you pegged full of lead.   The limitations of being on a previous generation's platform have also made their way into the mix, with a low polygon count, few textures, and a scant amount of models per area. The frame rate however stays consistent, and while the list of hindrances may sound like a huge backwards leap, the visuals remain clean, crisp, and vibrant. To the untrained eye, Headhunter is just as pretty as anything else on the market, and technicalities are just that.   Sound  Easily among the elite in voice acting, Amuze managed to pull off a video game rarity: Believable dialog. Cheesy only when doing so on purpose, the dramatic range of each talent is on par with plenty of popular action films, and in some instances surpasses them. Jack and Angela in particular are standouts among the cast, and nearly match the quality of Eidos' trendsetter Soul Reaver.   Ambient sounds and cutscene music too is top notch, with a distinct lineage to such cult favorites as Hard to Kill and Out for Justice. With just the right amount of piano and xylophone taps pulsing away in the background for drama and swelling horns and organs piercing the sound barrier during the intense action moments, Headhunter does its job well. Too bad that the sound effects aren't as prominent as they should be.A blockbuster it may not be, but Headhunter is still a fun and atmospheric sleeper that rises up and engages your imagination. Developed characters, an intriguing storyline, and a fair dose of action and adventure should keep thousands of starved gamers occupied for hours. An easy recommendation for old school gunners, looking for a noir-ish take on their favorite genre.", "date": "May 14, 2002"}
