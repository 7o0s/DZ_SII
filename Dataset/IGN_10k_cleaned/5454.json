And why shouldn't they be? Both games are fast, beautiful and original and both games feature some of the best music and graphics ever witnessed on a home-console. But maybe more than anything else, the Wipeout franchise carries with it a strong standard of unique, futuristic style and ambience brought to life with neon-glowing tracks, Japanese signs and a Bladerunner-esque feel.Up until recently, the idea of Wipeout coming to Nintendo 64 was ludicrous. Why, after all, would one of Sony's most beloved developers jump ship and start producing for the company's biggest competitor? Maybe it was because UK-based Psygnosis was intrigued by the power of Nintendo's hardware or possibly because the system had proven itself as a contender. Or maybe it was just because. We honestly don't care. What matters is that Sony-owned Psygnosis, somewhere along the line, decided to establish itself as a Nintendo 64 developer. And its debut title? Wipeout 64.The good news is that Wipeout 64 is no hand-me-down. You won't find any of the race-tracks from previous incarnations of the series in the game. It isn't a shoddily executed port of Wipeout XL with blurry graphics and terrible music. Wipeout 64, Psygnosis first N64 effort, is one hell of a ride that is all about new additions, better control, more speed and enhanced graphics. And guess what? Even the music rocks. We think Nintendo 64 owners are in for a real surprise with this one.GameplayWipeout 64 is admittedly, at its core, a racing game. But by no means is it just a racing game. Players race through a variety of tracks with futuristic hover-vehicles. In other words, cars float a few feet above the ground and maneuver accordingly. Using two air-brakes, players can skillfully navigate their vehicles through sharp turns, huge drop-offs, slanted tunnels and the like. And it's fast. Real fast. In fact, it feels faster than F-Zero X. Whereas Nintendo's racer blazes along with super smooth framerates, it features virtually no background detail. Wipeout 64, on the other hand, doesn't move quite as quick as F-Zero, but because it features much more side-to-side detail, the overall effect is actually faster, much more disorienting and, believe it or not, exciting.In addition, Wipeout 64 ups the ante with a wide selection of in-game weapons that can be used to blow opposing racers into smithereens. The arsenal consists of mines that explode on contact with enemy racers; turbo boosts that give players added speed for a limited time; rockets and missiles that seek out and punish racers; electro bolts that cause opponents to stall; thunder bombs that inflict mass damage and quake disruptors that send a giant wave through the track, knocking off opponents like dominos. All of the above and newly added power weapons unique to each vehicle.But Wipeout 64 isn't just about destroying opponents. It's about skillful navigation through twisting, turning, relentless tracks. Those familiar with the Wipeout games on PlayStation will likely remember how difficult it is to master the courses. Scraping against a wall in the original Wipeout, for example, results in the immediate halting of a player's vehicle. It's frustrating to say the least. For Wipeout XL, Psygnosis improved the control system greatly, enabling ships to consistently scrape against the sides of walls without crashing to a complete stop. And until playing Wipeout 64, we thought XL was as good as it got. Luckily, Pygnosis proved us wrong.The control in Wipeout 64 is significantly tighter than any other Wipeout game. Utilizing the analog stick (the D-Pad is not used), ships respond quickly and precisely. The floaty feeling of old is definitely still there, but that said, it's much more balanced than ever before. Die-hard Wipeout fans are bound to be skeptical upon reading this, we know, but consider this: we absolutely love Wipeout XL. However, after playing Wipeout 64 there's just no going back. Because ships respond so much better, it's far easier to navigate sharp turns without crashing into walls. In fact, using the R and L buttons (air-brakes), no turn, regardless of speed, is impossible to maneuver. Top notch.Unlike most other racers, Wipeout 64 forgoes a Grand Prix mode in lieu of a unique Challenge Mode. Competing in three categories (Race, Time Trial, and Weapon) will earn you a new car, a new weapon, and the bonus track. In each category, players have to meet certain conditions, such as ~destroy the race leader~, or ~qualify at least third~, to move on to the next race. If you just want to race with a vehicle of your choice, you can also pick your favorite track in the ~Single Race~ or a ~Time Trial~ modes. The multiplayer races and the ability to switch off weapons, checkpoints, computer ships, and catch-up logic round off the options.Like its predecessors before it, Wipeout 64 serves up a commendable selection of classes, vehicles and courses. Classes, ranging from Vector to Phantom, vary in difficulty and speed. Vehicles, from Feisar and AG Systems to Auricom, Direx and, of course, Piranha II, all boast their own unique attributes, weapons, weaknesses and strengths. And speed. Lots and lots of speed. Where the game comes up short is in its number of tracks -- only seven. By comparison, F-Zero X has more than three times as many (or even virtually unlimited tracks thanks to its course generator). Extreme-G 2 has double Wipeout 64's offerings. But it should be noted that W64's race-tracks are by far the most detailed and best designed. The tracks in F-Zero X, let's face it, are downright generic. Courses in Wipeout, on the other hand, are filled with diversity. Whether it be underwater worlds or animated, spiralling tunnel-tracks, Wipeout 64 does it -- and does it right.MultiplayerAnd so we come to the game's multiplayer mode. Let's split this into two sections: two-player races and four-player races. Two-player racing is top notch. It all looks nearly just as good as the single-player game, features computer drones and it runs almost as fast. While the three-player mode is decent, the four-player game though, well, that's an entirely different story. It's not quite up there, as it slows down a bit and, because individual player windows are so small, it's sometimes confusing.Everything said and done, F-Zero X is probably the better multiplayer game, but it doesn't have weapons and Wipeout actually serves up a multitude of competing vehicles even in the two-player mode. What are you looking for?GraphicsIn all honesty, we weren't expecting much in the visual department. We figured Psygnosis simply couldn't outdo what it had achieved on PlayStation. We were wrong. Levels are colorful and highly detailed. Clean, well-designed textures blend perfectly together for eye-popping tracks that rival XL's beauty. And what's more, there's no pixelization and no texture-warping. Additionally, N64's filtering effects have worked wonders, giving W64 a smoothed-out look without the blurry side-effect.Pretty as it may be, W64 still has its share of graphic flaws, but nothing so bad that it can't be easily overlooked. Like the PlayStation version, and probably because of it, W64 features copious amounts of pop-up and draw-in glitches. Also, clipping is evident when straying off track and some of the special effects are mediocre at best (the explosions are hideous). Other than that, well done Psygnosis.Sound~There's absolutely no way Wipeout 64 will ever sound as good as Wipeout XL,~ said us just a few months ago. After all, how could Nintendo's cartridge format compete with PlayStation's CD luxuries? Wipeout XL had The Chemical Brothers and Prodigy. What does Wipeout 64 have? Fluke and The Propellerheads. That's right. The game features digitized renditions of ~Goodnight Lover,~ ~Absurd~ from Fluke and ~Bang On!~ courtesy of The Propellerheads. And get this: it all sounds excellent, despite the mono compression. Really, honestly -- it sounds great. Not to be outdone by the professional competititon, game music composers PC Music supplied the rest of the soundtrack, doing an equally excellent job. Wipeout fans are in for a real treat here.The sound effects are also well-done, with clean boost audio and excellent ~scrape~ noises. On the downside, some of the sound effects, especially some lines of the famous announcer of Wipeout XL, are sorely missing from W64. While it's still there for weapons pick-ups, the ~Amiga~ talking announcer of old has partially been replaced by the voice of cheery woman. Highly lame. But that's just being picky. All in all, Psygnosis pulled off a miracle. In case you're wondering why there is load-time in between levels: according to Psygnosis, the short break is needed for sound decompression.Six months ago I would have kicked myself in the ass for writing what I'm about to write, but truth be told, I like Wipeout 64 better than F-Zero X. Not just a little better, but a whole lot better. The game, lesser framerate considered, plays faster than Nintendo's racer, features a good selection of weapons, classes and courses. Visuals are absolutely beautiful, in-game music and sound effects are top-notch and control has been significantly improved over previous incarnations of the Wipeout franchise. I couldn't be happier. That is, unless Psygnosis would have thrown in about five extra courses. Other than that, Wipeout 64 is awesome. A definite buy. Well done Psygnosis and nice job Midway for picking this one up.", "date": "Nov 4, 1998"}
