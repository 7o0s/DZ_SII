Gameloft's Brothers in Arms 3D is the bridge between traditional video games and mobile games -- two worlds that many believe never could (or should) meet. But here it is, a fully polygonal shooter that delivers intense action married with slickly produced atmosphere. If you have a handset capable of playing 3D games and have wanted to test your thumbs at something different than the casual games that currently dominate the mobile scene -- and rightfully so -- then this game absolutely deserves to be your next download.   Now, not everybody wants a game like this for their handsets. Many mobile gamers -- myself included -- love the one-thumb style of play. But just because I have explored the theory that traditional video games have become too exclusive for their own good doesn't mean that I consider myself outside their spell. After all, I'm right in the demographic. And I believe that my demographic -- what is considered the media-saturated, hardcore gamer -- will absolutely eat this game up. I don't go to the movie theater without my Game Boy Advance SP. (Sorry, the DS is too bulky for my pockets. Come on, DS Lite.) But if I hadn't already played Brothers in Arms 3D for this review, I would certainly be tempted to, as this mobile game is a true console experience.   Brothers in Arms, for those unfamiliar with the franchise, is Ubisoft's World War II shooter series, not entirely unlike EA's popular Medal of Honor or Activision's Call of Duty. Shown in an over-the-shoulder perspective, Brothers in Arms 3D details your soldier's experiences in two battlefields: Normandy and Tunis. The Axis threat is not yet in its last throes, and you'll be fighting long and hard against some very aggressive Germans.   The game opens with a tutorial of sorts that teaches you the basic mechanics of the game. Checkpoints lead you through the environments, which are very much alive with gunfire and the general chaos of war. You move with either the thumbpad or the 2, 4, 6 and 8 keys. Strafing is handled with 1 and 3. Newer handsets can handle multiple button inputs, so you can indeed shoot while running. You can lob grenades into enemy nests, using a scope to target snipers, and call on heavy firepower to flush out hostiles.   Later missions will introduce you to vehicles, which really offer variety -- even when none is needed. Even if the game was entirely on-foot, you'd have to be a hard-hearted game snob to get bored. The tank missions are especially thrilling, as you command those monsters against other tanks in the battlefield.   The contextual commands act as shorthand in frantic situations. When you run up to a wall, your soldier immediately goes flush. When you approach a crate or barricade, your soldier crouches. Press forward when the soldier crouches behind a crate and he leaps over it with rifle raised. This ~shorthand~ is imperative for success on a mobile phone, as you don't have all the freedom to map actions to the almost unlimited buttons of an Xbox 360 controller. And, in many ways, this is preferable for me. Sometimes having too many commands mapped to all those buttons can lead to trouble. For example, last night I was playing Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter online and while trying to get away from a grenade, I accidentally pressed in on one of the sticks too hard, slipped into scoped mode, and was totally unable to run away fast enough.   The action is Brothers in Arms 3D is fast and indeed quite furious. The enemies are good shots and are smart about charging ahead or taking cover. All of your weapons are put to good use -- nothing is superfluous. Grenades are used to destroy enemies hiding behind bunkers. Bazookas are used to target either hard-to-reach hostiles or to bring down bigger targets.   As mentioned, the atmosphere in Brothers in Arms 3D is incredible. The ambient noise, such as the crack of faraway gunfire or the roar of enemy fighter engines zooming overhead, is pretty amazing for a mobile game. There is quite a bit of digitized speech, from the threats of Nazi thugs to your allied soldiers. The environments are huge (for mobile) and feel incredibly open, even though the game does ~guide~ you quite a bit through them. The polygonal soldiers and enemies look good up-close, covered with nice textures. When they get a bit away from the camera, though, individual soldiers can look more like a jumble of gray polygons than an actual enemy trooper. The buildings are well constructed, too, although the draw-in distance lets you sometimes see pieces load into place. That might be a big deal in a game running on the PS2, but for an ambitious mobile game like this that is so far ahead of the curve, I hardly cared.  Brothers in Arms 3D is an achievement. This is the mobile game you can wag under the nose of those snotty, graphics whore friends that turn their noses up at cell phone gaming. This is an incredible game in its own right, but framed in the context of mobile gaming, it's a triumph. If you have a 3D handset that can run this, give it a download. And if you are still sitting on that free handset you got with a two-year contract, Brothers in Arms 3D is reason to upgrade. I will always treasure casual games, but I cannot deny what Gameloft has accomplished here. This sets the bar for hardcore games on mobile, and I honestly don't know if anybody (save for Gameloft themselves) can beat it.", "date": "Apr 13, 2006"}
