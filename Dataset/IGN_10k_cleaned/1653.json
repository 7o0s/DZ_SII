Thanks to the over-the-top, crude, low-brow humor of the recently-released Adam Sandler flick, we portable gamers get a GBC game that pushes as much of the same crude humor as Nintendo and that rather gray-area T rating on the box will allow. Just like the movie, Little Nicky on the Game Boy Color is a bit sloppy in places, but for the most part Adam Sandler's first pixel role is a good one. Features  Based on the raucous Adam Sandler movie 14 platforming levels romping through New York City Burp fire, posses pedestrians, and spread evil around the world Five mini-games based on the film Only for Game Boy Color    Nicky is the son of Satan. In fact, he's one of three sons, and his dad is ready to retire and give up the throne of Hell. Nicky doesn't want the job, but his brothers do. And when Satan decides not to hand it over to Nicky's brothers, they get all pissed and run away to the real world, freezing the wall of fire that separates hell from earth. This prevents any new souls from entering hell, which essentially makes Satan start to fall apart and die. Nicky's been recruited to go up to Earth, and bring back his brothers in a vial in order to save his pop. So begins the adventure on the Game Boy Color.  The game version follows many of the same plot elements of the film, but in action/platform style. Nicky isn't exactly strong right out of the gate  he walks around slower than molasses and can only jump. But when he heats up, that's when the fun begins  wander into fire and he'll run much faster and have the ability (if the level allows it) to belch fire or zap an evil ray at enemies...or fly for short periods of time. If he gets too hot, though, he'll run around like a maniac and it'll be difficult to keep him in check until the juice runs off. It's this heating element that adds a lot to the gameplay, as you'll have to find the different locations in the game that'll increase the Nicky's power.   Most of the game's level layout is very traditional  rising, falling, and collapsing platforms, staircasing girders...the usual fare. There are a few unique levels, like the subway level early on where you'll have to make your way to little gaps in the floor before the train comes barreling down the track. Some levels in the game are bit too difficult for their own good  especially in the early levels when you have to figure out how to get through a zapping electric current, a hopping rat and a giant cockroach, all at the same time. But the game spans 19 levels with enough variety in the level design to keep the interest going until the final rounds. And if that's not enough, there are five minigames that are available right from the get-go, most of which are based on scenes in the film. The best of the bunch is the dartboard with the human head in the center  very gory if you happen to get the dart smack in the middle of an eyeball. But hey, that's what that T rating's for...  The entire production is quality work, but there are some places with spotty programming and awkward interfaces. The character sprites will flicker and glitch-out in some of the more graphically-intensive levels  even in the very early rounds. The intermissions are also timed a bit weird, with text sometimes popping off-screen too quickly to follow...and in the basketball boss level, the text actually gets cut off-screen because the screen fails to move over far enough. And for some reason, you have to skip through the introduction every time you exit the game...even after a single minigame.   But Digital Eclipse manages to sandwich in a few laughs into the game. Your amount of ~tries~ is dictated by how deteriorated your dad is  every time you lose a life, your pop loses a part of his body. He'll even egg you on with super clear digitized audio  I always get a chuckle when Satan's nothing more than a hand on a throne, and he exclaims, ~I've got no arms, Nicky!~  The audio is probably the best treat in the game, as there are several Adam Sandler sound bites throughout the game, and the music is definitely some of the best heard on a GBC cartridge. You still won't want to hook up a set of speakers to your system, but it's great to hear how much the audio drivers have evolved for the tiny system.    Little Nicky was made for the folks who have seen the movie  the game's introduction and in-jokes will make absolutely no sense to people who skipped out on Adam Sandler's latest flick. But the game adds a few cool elements to a very traditional genre -- the Game Boy Color game is a decent challenge, even with its quirky glitches. You don't need to be a Sandler fan to appreciate the design that went into his first videogame. Now, about that Happy Gilmore game...", "date": "Dec 16, 2000"}
