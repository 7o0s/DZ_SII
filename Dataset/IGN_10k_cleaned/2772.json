So when Midway began applying the magic formula of big head modes, ~catching fire~ and excessive violence to other sports, you'd think that an adrenaline fueled Midway game of soccer would provide plenty of opportunity for all kinds of nuttiness. In RedCard 20-03 you get a loose interpretation of the rules and conventions of soccer, like you expect, but the wild, fast paced arcade gameplay isn't as wild and fast paced as you'd expect and pales in comparison to its football and hockey cousins.   Put another way, there's a reason the only coverage we've given you on RedCard is this review you're reading now.  Gameplay Perhaps RedCard's biggest surprise, and therefore probably it's greatest limitation, is that it captures the essence of real soccer with 11-on-11 play. Playing the game isn't as cut and dry as the other features, as it can be severely affected by one little option: The Referee Strictness. Basically the cut off point between sim and arcade, a quick slide of the bar from 'strict' to 'off' completely changes everything. With strictness turned on, the game is damn near unplayable with players drawing penalties regularly.   The real meat of the game is when there are no rules at all, forcing you to go tooth and nail with the other team in a balls-out struggle to be number one. Slide kicks, slide tackles, flaming hot-foot bombs to the face, and all other manner of nastiness is a great way to relieve stress and an even better way to win. Rules are for sissies and this is the only way to come close to the wacky arcade action you expect from a Midway ~adrenaline~ sports game.   Chances are that if you've played Blitz then you'll pick up on RedCard in no time. Boost buttons, turbo keys, a fantastic two player mode, and all the other familiar control schemes from the NFL days are still in effect, with the learning curve slanting in your direction after about five minutes. Despite the similarities to Blitz and NHL Hitz, however, RedCard doesn't quite live up to the party topping entertainment that those two did.  The problem lies in the fact that RedCard never quite decides whether or not it wants to be a simulation or an arcade game. Even when moving the Ref-bar all the way down to 'off,' the flash and over the top wackiness found in Midway's other productions just isn't there. Closer to FIFA without rules than Blitz with a soccer ball, staying interested as intensely as you would in another similar title (like GameCube's Sega Soccer Slam or even NHL Hitz). Several contests into our office round robins, we realized that RedCard's engine was a strong one, but leaned too far in the simulation side to be as fun as it could have been. RedCard's four gameplay modes didn't offer enough variety, like say Hitz' wealth of minigames, with its Finals Mode, World Conquest Mode, Friendly Mode and Tournament Mode. The first two are extremely similar with Finals mode requiring you to take your nation through a 32 team field like the World Cup whereas World Conquest simply requires you to beat all 50 nations and a handful of fantasy teams. Even the fantasy teams in RedCard seem uninspired with you competing against Penguins and Dolphins. When is this supposed to be fun?  Graphics Midway certainly knows how to put together a quality grass texture. Vibrant and realistic, the soccer lawn is a better field than most anywhere else. Solid, well-designed stadiums and arenas are also worth their salt, but the near-lifeless crowd doesn't quite match the audio fanfare that goes with it. It doesn't make a lot of sense when you hear the mob like-roar of the audience only to watch them sit flatter than a river leech. Goal celebrations improve the situation quite a bit however, as the crowd really comes alive with confetti, streamers, flashbulbs, and more.  Character models are moderately sized and offer a fair amount of familiar animation by way of classic soccer attacks. Close up facial expressions, taunts, and all sorts of human reaction have been scattered throughout the presentation with the only real concern surrounding the far camera shots. Kind of bland with a healthy dose of shimmer, the downfield angles could have used some work. Like the crowd though, the players really stand out whenever a point is made, with dramatic celebration animations and some effective celebratory flotsam.  Of course what people really want to know about are the special effects. Fiery bicycle kicks, slow-motion Matrix-like double taps, and a few other choice selections did manage to make the final cut, but if you're looking for crazy volcanic soccer balls or earthquakes that open up the ground and swallow your people whole, RedCard can't match outlandishness of Hitz or Blitz.  Sound Since this is supposed to be an arcade game we figured that the announcers would have plenty of humorous quips and comments, and that we would be rolling in bombastic Midway humor. Were we wrong or what?  Don't misunderstand; the play calls are top notch and very professional but at times just way too realistic for our liking. While we were on the field fouling each other like a pair of squabbling siblings, the gentlemen behind the mike were quaintly chatting away like this was a real life soccer game. Where are the jokes? The ribs? Where's the Boom-Shaka-Laka? I guess, after all these years, it isn't the shoes! The rest of the audible goodies are well done with an effective (if not hypocritical) crowd chanting and cheering for their teams and referees that blow their whistles like train conductors. The pang of the ball kick, the slight swish of the net, it's all in there.  If any sport could benefit from a bit of Midway craziness, then soccer, the sport the world calls football, is it. It's nonstop, back and forth action, gives soccer the same kind of appeal as hockey and Hitz worked out fine for Midway. So what happened here?It looks like Midway wanted to capitalize on the soccermania that would be dominating the globe during the World Cup which is why we get real players and a comprehensive roster of nations. But the resulting identity crisis means serious soccer fans won't get all of the authenticity they want and casual arcade fans won't get all of the thrills they expect from a Midway game entitled RedCard soccer. This is quite often the kiss of death in any game whether it's sports, racing or what have you and RedCard soccer has puckered up nicely. We give this game a real red card for flagrant behavior and send it off with a heavy heart. Not sure if this franchise will be disqualified for the next game as well, but for now you may want to give it a short rent to see if you'll love it like Pele or if it should be kicked to the curb like France.
