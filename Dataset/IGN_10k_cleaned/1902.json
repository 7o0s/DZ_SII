{"name": "Ultima Online: Third Dawn", "name_review": "Ultima Online: Third Dawn", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/16/ultima-online-third-dawn", "text": "I was an avid Ultima Online player in the early months of its existence. After player killing got out of hand, and I was introduced to a new game called EverQuest, I left the land of Britannia behind, and didn't look back (until Renaissance was released, and only for one quick session). Ultima Online is going through its fourth retail revision (original release, Second Age, Renaissance, and now this) entitled ~Third Dawn.~ This latest re-packaging of the now aging online RPG adds a 3D client to what was previously a two-dimensional game, as well as all of the tweaks and updates that have been made to the game since Renaissance was released.  For those of you who have been living in a cave for the past four years or so, Ultima Online is one of the first graphical massively multiplayer online role-playing games to reach large commercial success.  Thousands of people each month live out their virtual lives in Britannia and new players still join up -- many of whom are playing an online RPG for the first time. The game allows you to play virtually any type of character you want via a skill-based advancement system where the more you use a skill the better you will become at it. On the other hand, if you neglect a skill your ability in it will slowly drop over time.   When you first create a character you are able to choose from various character templates to make swordsmen, wizards, or others. You also have the option to completely customize your character by distributing the skill points as you see fit. For newer players the templates are great, while more experienced players can completely customize a character however they want.  If you are a new player, your character is flagged as ~young,~ and you are put into a short tutorial that teaches you the basics of controlling yourself in the world of Britannia. After exploring the tutorial, you are popped into a town called Haven, which is where my new adventure in Britannia began. Since I played Renaissance a little bit, I knew what to expect in Haven, but I did spend some time exploring this ~newbie~ town. Here you are able to practice skills, explore, and receive help from in-game volunteers. Once you feel brave enough to let loose the training wheels so to speak; you can take a moongate that leads to the starting city that you chose at the beginning of the game.  Having fond memories of life in Vesper, I started my little Swordsman there and actually found that a lot has changed since I last adventured in Britannia. Back when UO first launched, the world was rather bare and lifeless. Sure, there were some NPCs in shops, and once in a while you would run across a stray animal in the forest, but most of the time your combat would be centered on the many dungeons in the game, which made skill advancement go pretty slow.  Sometime between Renaissance and Third Dawn new life has been breathed into the world. There are now many more NPCs running around the town, and the forests are literally teeming with hordes of beasts. Taking just a few steps out of town I found tons of animals that I could kill to practice my swordsmanship skill on, as well as plenty to skin to add some gold to my bank account.  With the added number of things to kill, your skills go up a little quicker as you are using them more, which gives a little more reward for those people who demand results immediately. And with the absence of hordes of Player Killers in the ~New Lands~ (the ~Old Lands~ are where you are in danger most of the time), you no longer have to live in fear whenever you leave the safety of town. Those two things alone make the game a lot more fun to play.  Ok, so the game is more enjoyable to play now, but how is the new 3D client? Pretty decent, but the game still looks dated. While the new polygonal player models and paper dolls add a whole lot of new animations to the game, and the backgrounds have added detail, it still looks just like Ultima Online. If you were going into Third Dawn expecting an amazing 3D engine that would put EverQuest to shame, you will be sorely disappointed.   What you do get is a new client for those people who live and die by their spiffy new 3D accelerator and believe that every single game they buy must give a little love to their newest monster card. It will probably breath a little more life into this, one of the oldest MMORPGs in existence, and maybe it will help those people devastated by the canning of Ultima Worlds Online: Origin (what kind of title was that, anyways?).  If UO has proved anything, it's that online gaming is a viable platform of entertainment. People form lasting memories and friendships in this digital fantasy world, and that has to stand for something. Yet, even with all these years to improve the gameplay, some of the oldest problems in the game are still existent.  The evil lag beast rears it's ugly head from time to time, even on a broadband connection, and once in a while a NPC that you are leading on a quest will vanish after you cross a ~Server Line.~ But you know what? In the light of all the things that the developers have done to actually improve the game experience (such as dealing with PKs, speeding up advancement with more things to kill, etc.) you can look above small annoyances such as those and actually enjoy the game again. And isn't that what gaming is all about?  -- Jeremy Conrad      Want to share your opinions with the world?
