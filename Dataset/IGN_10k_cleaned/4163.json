If you're really unlucky, you'll be up late and catch a direct-to-video release featuring some black haired guy with one constipated facial expression who's off on a mission to kill all the drug dealers and turban-wrapped terrorists. With Fugitive Hunter, Black Ops has made a videogame for that movie.   A game that's four years in the making, but looks like one-tenth of that time was spent, Fugitive Hunter almost gives the phrase ~quick and dirty~ a bad name. As CIFR (Criminal Interdiction and Fugitive Recovery Task Force) Agent Seaver, the goal here is to capture terrorists around the world, leading up to Osama bin Laden himself. It's a first-person shooter of the most third-rate variety and releasing this title must have been a matter of getting it out so the people involved with making it could move on with their lives.   Gameplay  Fugitive Hunter is all about getting a collection of big guns and blasting at loads of baddies. Machine guns? Check. Grenade launchers? Check. Rocket launchers? Check. Enemies that pile on in hordes and respawn to liven up the action? Check. Wait a minute, go back one there.   Let's get started with this most bizarre feature in a first-person shooter: the never-ending thug. Some moments of Fugitive Hunter bring drug dealers and Al Qaeda members back from the dead. Clear out a level and all of a sudden someone will start shooting you in the back because they just appeared there. The usual task of mopping up a level to find all the hidden treats suddenly got livelier.    How do I know that they re-spawn and aren't just coming in from another room? Well, one fellow appeared inside of a crate. This gave him the ability to shoot me while I couldn't shoot him. Other people appeared half in walls, stuck there until I shot their arms and legs to death.   In the later levels in Afghanistan, the act of leaving a room or hallway and coming back will fill it back up with guys shooting at you. When I was trying to find all the final objectives to capture the big guy himself and did a lot of backtracking in caves, I had to repeatedly mow down the same group of guys. Since the health power-ups have a limit per level, this meant that taking too long led to more enemies which led to death which led to using up more continues.   Cats have nine lives and in Fugitive Hunter you'll get eight to start with. Starting out with seven continues, more can be earned by finding hidden medallions throughout the game. Instead of forcing a level to be replayed, a continue can be used to keep going from the same spot with 100% health and armor. Apparently, since the enemies can come back to life, so can you. It's a band-aid fix for a gushing wound of a game. If players run into an excessive firefight that's severely unbalanced it's all right because they can plow through with continues.   The only person that can't be killed is the fugitive that is being hunted. Taking the action down a few more notches, engaging the boss leads to a fighting game. Complete with health bars on top of the screen and combos that involve hitting just two buttons at once, this is one of the dumbest and goofiest fighting simulations I've ever seen. Get the health bar low enough and the grappling mode starts where fast tapping on the X button beats them into submission. Just mashing my thumb all over the buttons saved the day.   The actual plot of the game is almost too bad to go into. In infiltrating a cocaine cartel's house, a woman on the beach, Carmina, provides the key to the front gate. Later on, inside the house, an objective is given to rescue her and when you do she gives you the code to ride the elevator to the basement. There's no explanation for how she was captured or why she has this info because there's never any more back story than bounty being offered to nab the terrorist leaders.    Graphics  No graphics could really save this game, but it would have been nice if they even tried. Characters don't move their mouths when they speak and have less movement in their bodies than my old G.I. Joe action figures.    The walls and all of the objects on the levels have maybe a dozen polygons between them, leaving right angles all over the place. Some caverns are so simple I would believe it if an intern had been allowed to do the whole thing.    The menus and intro screens are incredibly low-budget affairs. Video from the news, Al Qaeda training videos, and footage of flags get put into a collage to express the need for a terrorist task force. Maybe a fifth of the footage is actually made just for this game.   Sound  The music and audio will make you either cringe or groan, sometimes both at once. The voices collect some of the worst one-liners from all the action movies and put them here. Every time I used the scope on the sniper rifle I heard, ~time to get close and personal,~ or ~it's time to get close,~ or something similar. Killing an enemy often causes some other statements like ~gotcha,~ or ~he won't be coming back.~ Even during the grappling scenes with the fugitives, both of them are making comments the whole time. While being strangled, one fugitive kept going off about how I'd never find all his bank accounts to which Seaver responded, ~I'm closing your account.~    The soundtrack is a group of some hip-hop throwaway tracks. Kicking in during the action, a few tracks favor twangy Middle Eastern melodies that are backed by bouncy, bassy rhythms. Meant to amp up the action, its high-pitched melody serves more as an incentive to kill everyone to get it to stop. A mellower hip-hop track on the soundtrack features a lazy MC who keeps repeating the phrase, ~Fugitive Hunter. PS2. Comin' for me and comin' for you,~ as if I had completely forgotten just what game I was playing on what system.Fugitive Hunter is not the worst first-person shooter out there by a long shot, but it dives pretty low. With low-budget quality in every different aspect of the game, it's only the appeal of going after Osama bin Laden that drives this title. With bin Laden out of the news ever since the Iraqi war started, even this distinction has faded a bit. I could only recommend it if someone were to have a deep down urge to kill a lot of people wearing turbans.", "date": "Nov 11, 2003"}
