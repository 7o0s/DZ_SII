Among the ranks of the state of the art occasionally sits a rudimentary concept that can be just as entertaining as the new and flashy.  Hailing from Denmark, the developers at Space Time Foam have taken that thought and kicked out Chase Ace 2, the sequel to a game which a good majority of us probably never had the pleasure of seeing.  In fact, this newest installment is so simplistic in its form that the entire set of instructions for gameplay consists of ~fly your spaceship around on the level and shoot at everything that shoots at you.~  Let's face it, what more do you really need?  So, with the premise effectively nailed down, all that remains is to provide a method for doing it.  Coming into the opening interface there are a host of options.  Players can modify just about everything in the game at this point.  Enemy spawn times, powerup availability, game speed, music type, and pretty much everything else is presented here.  After the tweaking session, users can choose from any number of about 25 arenas in which to battle as well as a starting ship.  The arenas are conveniently ranked into categories of varying difficulty to assist newbies and veterans alike.  Also available is the choice to proceed into an Arena Game or a Course Game.  The first being a one time deal, and the latter being a series of levels linked together.  Players progress through Course Games by completing the stated objectives in each level, and then moving onto the next phase.  Moving forth to the actual gameplay, things don't look too impressive at first.  The game is presented in a top down, two-dimensional perspective with less than astounding visuals.  However, no book should be judged only by its cover, and the same applies to games (or at least this one).  Everything on screen moves with whipped cream smoothness and the physics models appear flawless.  Darting around the arena using the fully customizable keyboard interface, pilots will discover several things that will be the bane of their existence.  Proximity mines, missile and mortar turrets, black holes, and of course enemy ships are all out to make sure you don't make the high score table.  It's your job to fly around and use your limited ammunition and shields to vanquish these baddies before they crisp your vessel.  Keep in mind that the AI of the turrets and enemy ships are completely adjustable as well.  Players can make these entities range from dumber than bricks to frighteningly accurate with one click of a slider bar.    Now, with all of these obstacles around, it's only fair to throw in a few things that can help budding heroes to the victory stand.  Each level is equipped with varying numbers of ammunition and shield regenerators so you won't be completely out of luck if these start getting low.  While it's possible to completely run out of ammunition (though I wouldn't recommend it), depleting your shields to zero results in the destruction of your craft.  So try to at least keep that second one in tip-top shape.  Though these helpful items certainly help to even the score between you and your foes, no shooting game would be complete without lots and lots of weapons.  Ammunition crates spawn into the level at random locations at a frequency which is of course customizable.  Occasionally, these crates contain one of the game's 30 available power-ups (and yes, you can adjust how often they show up too).  Collecting these bad boys and turning them loose on your enemies is the ultimate revenge, and it also happens to be really, really fun.  Watching the explosions which result from your onslaught is where much of the thrill is generated.  They are very big, very loud, and actually somewhat realistic as far as debris and so forth.  You won't want to be too close to the action though since being caught in the firestorm that arises from these suckers is a fantastic way to drain your shields into the cellar.  Since the weapons are by far the most entertaining aspect of this title, here's a rundown of what you'll find in the arenas.  This list includes the locked power-ups that are released at seemingly random moments during gameplay.    Enemy Seeking Ammo - Fire and forget....  All shots fired from your vessel will track to the nearest enemy.  Annoying when you're trying to shoot at mines or ammunition crates, but invaluable in a fight.  Missiles - Your garden variety dummy missiles.  They blow up whatever is ahead of you, plain and simple.  Laser Cannon - This powerful weapon dumps a stream of raw energy for a good range at whatever lies ahead.  A continuous blast of about 2-3 seconds will make anything pop.  Mines - Plop down some charges on the battlefield that will only go off when your enemies pass over them.  Double Shots - Double the firepower for whatever weapon you have selected.  Triple Shots - See above, do the math.   Auto Fire - Holding down the trigger will do the job now.  Fires a continuous stream of your currently selected weapon.  Power Shield - Erects a forcefield that will absorb damage equivalent to about what your ship could normally withstand before exploding, and then vanishes leaving you with whatever shields you had when you first picked it up.  Double Power Shield - Economy-sized version of the Power Shield absorbs twice the punishment.  Note that this is stackable with the original.  Deflector - Pushes whatever is close to you away from your position.  This doesn't include mines, but does include just about everything else.  Violent Death - A real gem, this loads your vessel with explosive charges that ensure that whoever takes you out is going with you to the graveyard.  Mortar Bullets - Explosive rounds....two or three of these ruins anyone's day.  Shield Refill - Full shield recharge on the go.  Ammo Refill - You guessed it, fills up the ammunition for every weapon you currently carry.  Mine Thrower - Mines delivered with a more personal touch.  Lazer Trapper - Fans of Tron will enjoy this weapon.  Holding the trigger down leaves a laser wall behind you ship that will severely hamper your enemy's ability to stay alive.    Bounce Lazer Trapper - One of my favorites.... This weapon removes the necessity of moving around to lay down the laser wall.  It fires a stream of energy that bounces around the map instantaneously and then remains in place for around 20 seconds.  Rapid Fire - Increased shot speed, for those who need to hit those turrets NOW.  Sticky Missiles - A utility weapon of sorts, these missiles attach themselves to enemies and make moving a tricky chore.  Blitz Lazer - The last of the 'Lazer' line, this gun fires identically like the Bounce Lazer Trapper, but doesn't stick around afterwards.  Machine Gun - Another favorite, this sprays an extremely rapid burst of bullets ahead of your ship.  Being exposed to this foray for longer than a couple of seconds is most unfortunate.  Confused Missiles - A humorous weapon that fires missiles with what seems to be errant guidance systems.  These guys will roam around the map, bouncing off walls hoping to find something that resembles a target.  Homing Turret - Plants your own special turret wherever you'd like that only fires at enemies.  In fact, the ammo fired from these guns will miraculously not harm your ship.  Altitude Bombs - Launches explosive cherry bombs in a three-dimensional arc capable of traveling over walls and other obstacles.  Chi - Picking up the yin-yang symbol on the map allows you to fire extremely powerful, yet almost invisible waves of force from your vessel.  Gaz - Perhaps the only weapon I found to be largely useless, this spreads a pink gas around the arena making it hard for enemies to see, and thus navigate.  Macro Mine - Standard mines with a larger impact force.  Gets the job done.  Charge Rockets - A little inaccurate at long range, these little firecrackers sputter about and explode with the force of a missile.  Sticky Bombs - Another amusing weapon, these are small explosives which stick to enemy ships and explode around 15 seconds later.  They can be leeched onto other ships by passing over them.  Macro Mortar - Hands down the coolest weapon of them all.  This projects lightning quick mortal shells with some extra spunk and blast radius.  One direct hit from this will wipe away any pilot's worries.   Now that you've gotten a peek at the arsenal, you're ready to move into multiplayer.  One of the few beefs with this title comes in this area, as it only allows up to 3 simultaneous users.  Granted, the size of the arenas aren't really such to allow for more than that, but that could have very simply been solved by including larger arenas.  Aside from that, the experience is still very satisfying.  Human opponents, as is the case in most situations, provide a much greater challenge than even the most advanced bot.  Plus, with the vast amount of battlefields, weapons, and game settings available, there won't be much for the case of getting bored.  Also, if by some chance it does become monotonous, try out the game's level builder to spice things up, or download some of the free arenas from Chase Ace.com.    So what do we have here?  As far as I can see it, this is a highly addictive game with legions of options, weapons, and replay value.  It's a riot to play in either single or multiplayer mode, and the slim system requirements make it a definite candidate for even those computers with dusty tower cases.  Or, to put it as simply as Space Time Foam probably would, this game owns.  The only place you're going to find Chase Ace 2 is by ordering it at the official Chase Ace website.  So what are you waiting for? Go get it!  You'll thank us later.  -- Rich Rouse", "date": "May 4, 2000"}
