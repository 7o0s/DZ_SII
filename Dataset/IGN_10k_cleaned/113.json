{"name": "Tetris Plus", "name_review": "Tetris Plus", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/27/tetris-plus", "text": "Well, almost. The developers added a few new twists, the most interesting of which is the puzzle mode. Each puzzle level begins with the professor standing on a different pattern of blocks. You1ve got to clear the blocks out from under him to get him to the bottom. If you don't figure out the right way to solve this puzzle, he climbs to the top of the blocks you're stacking up. The game's over when the professor and the descending spiked ceiling collide. This version of the game is entertaining and even challenging, although after a while you begin to wonder why you're trying to rescue a guy who insists on climbing to his death.    Other new additions include an edit mode that lets you create and save your own puzzles. A split-screen mode enables two people to play Tetris at the same time without competing against one another. In the regular VS mode, you can still play the computer or a friend. As with most new puzzle games, you can send blocks to your opponent1s screen when you clear a certain amount from your own -- in this case, two rows of blocks cleared from your screen means two rows of blocks sent to your opponent.   If you like Tetris and you1re looking for a familiar, addictive game, this is the answer. Tetris Plus hasn1t revolutionized puzzle games, but it's still fun.  Jen Messina", "date": "Nov 27, 1996"}
