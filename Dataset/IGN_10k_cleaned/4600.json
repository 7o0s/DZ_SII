(We're not counting the Japanese Mega Man Soccer and Mega Man Battle and Chase since they aren't true to the series.) Midway's attempt at this kind of digression last year was an unfortunate failure (Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub Zero), but Capcom has taken its time with Legends and produced a fun hybrid that will immediately grow on fans on non-fans alike.  Mega Man Legends mixes action and adventure aspects with a smidgen of RPG elements to gracefully balance out this fully 3D, polygonal game.   The gameplay still actually feels like Mega Man of the 2D kind, with lots of platform elements, hidden areas, and of course, loads of blasting. But there is a long story behind the game that drives it in role-playing style. You get to know characters by revisiting them often, and much us of inventory items will make for better fighting and exploration. You will feel like you're playing a realtime action-RPG, but there is so much more to the game, it's hard to categorize  or put down.Not being a huge Mega Man fan, I can say that it's nice to know Capcom has pulled off such a well-tuned game in an area it's not familiar with (realtime action RPGs). Honestly, I really enjoyed Legends.What I like is the exploration aspects of the game because they're quite big, and the vast array of levels will surprise you. Having said that, the areas aren't generally that open for you to wander about in at any time. There are tightly controlled areas you can search into, or happen upon because of a serious mission or quest, or even when in search for parts or such. You will evetually get around most everything, but in really constrained segments.Even more surprising is the gradual learning curve that becomes difficult to ignore half way through. This game becomes more and more challenging as you progress, forcing you to really learn the moves intimately. And although frustrating at times, Legends makes you a better player, if you're up to the task.The biggest frustration I found was the control. It's taxing, and it's all digitally manipulated. Luckily you can change your camera angles with R2 or L2, or you can change the mode in options, which is helpful, but honestly, Legends is perfect for analog control, which it unfortunately does not support. Overall, the game is big and will take a good amount of time beat. The more I played Mega Man Legends, the more I wanted to play.", "date": "Sep 16, 1998"}
