{"name": "Grandia 2", "name_review": "Grandia II (Import)", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/08/22/grandia-ii-import", "text": "The first Grandia was all about adventure - no mistake.  Young Justin and even younger Sue went off on a make-shift adventure, were presented with the opportunity for a more serious adventure, which they accepted solely for the sake of adventuring, and headed off across the seas, where they first encountered Feena, an adventurer by profession.  And that's when the true adventure began, as Justin, Feena and Sue traveled the world, crossing new waters, and learning of an ancient legend. Grandia II resembles its predecessor in many areas of gameplay and design, but is such a dramatic departure in terms of story and scope that it could perhaps be labeled under a different series.  In many ways, we are getting more adult experience this time around, and in just as many ways the game is a marked improvement upon the original.  However, some strange problems in, of all places, storytelling, keep this from being the masterpiece we were all expecting.   When Gamearts spoke of a more adult story to accompany its latest RPG, they weren't joking.  The story of Grandia II deals with some surprisingly complex themes throughout its 40 hour course, and manages to break new ground in many ways.  Few character relationships are as complex as that of the three heroes for the game - if you're looking for an impressive topic for an English paper, I'd suggest ~On the subject of Millennia and Elena, touching upon Ryudo.~  Play through Grandia II, noting down the obvious, and often clever, use of symbolism in the relationship between these three, and have a ball educating your professor (or teacher, for the kiddies) on how far videogames have come.  For the first ten hours of the game, Gamearts in its true form as the master story tellers of the games industry, as the main characters are introduced, and we learn of the background story - an ancient fight between the dark lord Valmar and a holy deity called Granas.  The very final moments of the game, as things come to a close and all loose ends are tied up are just as wonderful.  Grandia II manages to evoke that incomparable feeling you get at the end of a particularly long story - a feeling that comes about when characters have developed right before your eyes, but their story is coming to an end.   The problem lay in that middle area, where we learn that there's more to the story than an ancient battle between good and evil, and where the characters actually develop - where Ryudo proves to be more than just a hardened body guard, where Elena learns to sing, and where pretty much all other characters grow from mere histories into breathing entities.  As usual, Gamearts does manage to inject a tremendous amount of life into its characters.  Whether it be the three heroes mentioned above or the supporting cast, all characters in the game have a tremendous level of personality, revealed as the characters actually converse with one another through pages and pages dialogue (something that should be somewhat of a shock to gamers used to the Final Fantasy way of doing just the opposite - giving us the barest minimum of talk).  Unfortunately, I found myself kept at a distance from the characters by often failing to understand their intentions and the basis for their actions.  How did he come to that conclusion?  Why do these guys care so much if he or she does this or that?  Why is he joining the party?  Why is he acting in such a manner?  Why doesn't he know this particular fact?  Where in the world did that twist come from?  You'll find yourself asking these questions numerous times throughout the course of the game's 40-or-so hours, and more often than not you need to resort to some sort of twisted, bad television writing logic to find the answers.  There is definitely something amiss with how this particular story is told, and the above is only the beginning.  The game also keeps overestimating its own sense of scope.  The story of Grandia II, and the travels of its heroines, are nowhere near as encompassing as in the original title.  But yet, Elena manages to comment to Ryudo early on that they've been on a great journey.  It didn't feel like a great journey to me at that point, and even later on down the road, I never got the sense of being on a massive adventure.   It often seems like Gamearts had more planned for the game.  Like on their way from point A to point B, Ryudo and co. were supposed to have journeyed to another town - something that got axed for some reason.  Perhaps the characters would have had a couple of extra moments to speak in that town, so we could see their relationships develop a bit more.  The game as is is constantly telling us, rather than showing us, what we should be thinking at a particular situation, and this problem is in part due to the story's problematic pacing.   Noriyuki Iwadare's aural treatment goes to great extremes to hold the fragile story together, and in many ways succeeds.  What better way than to feel you're in a different land than through an entirely different form of music, complete with differing instruments - that's what we get here, with each town having a different theme song.  Iwadare has an amazing range to his style.  The sequences between story events, where characters are traveling the land, adventuring, are accompanied by differing forms of music based on situation and local.  Early on, Elena and Ryudo's travels are set to happy, bubbly music, which fits the moment perfectly when you consider what just happened in the story.  Later on, you'll find a grand adventure theme pulled straight from Grandia, as the characters make an unheard of descent, and you'll hear a few sparse jungle beats, reminiscent (although with enough added life that it's not so god-awful) of the original's field music.   Surprisingly, the soundtrack is at its best during those confusing story moments, with mood setting pieces that never get repetitive, along with a couple of Portuguese songs which inspire a wide range of feeling.  If you've played through part 1 of the game, you'll recognize many of the themes - listen closely, and you'll realize that although the story and scope may be of a different variety, the music makes this Grandia through and through.  But despite Iwadare's efforts, Grandia II's weakest link is its story.  In fact, the game winds up being a true Gamearts rarity, where gameplay is given top priority.  And how!  In Grandia II, the dungeon design and battle system are top tier - perhaps the best ever seen in a turn-based RPG.  These two areas alone make this the Dreamcast's first must-have RPG.  The dungeons and play fields are a breath of fresh air following the boredom of the dungeons in Evolution 2.  The dungeons, for the most part, aren't too tough or tricky, but they're short enough so that you don't loose interest, and full of enough interactive elements so that you're constantly wondering what will happen next.  Interaction in one of the Grandia II dungeons involves pushing an action button, usually when prompted.  In one dungeon, you'll have Ryudo chop through vines to open up new areas.  In another dungeon, you'll trigger elevators to take you between a top translucent floor, and the floor that's visible beneath it.  There's even a Grandia 1-esque vertical climb, where Ryudo and crew must leap over gaps, climb ladders and be ware of hazardous roadway.  The interaction isn't necessarily the most complex out there, but it's at the level so as to not overshadow the rest of the game.  Some of the interactive elements are included just for fun.  In most towns, you can knock things over and run into barrels, although this area was done to a larger degree in part 1, admittedly.  You'll also find that some areas allow you to tap a button to trigger some random event, like making flowers spin.  And some dungeons have weird things going on in the background just for pure show.  It's obvious that Gamearts spent much time making sure every dungeon had as much personality as every town, something that they tried with the original, but have done a much better job of here.  The battle system has its roots in the original, and had the battles remained fully 2D, you'd be hard pressed to differentiate the two.  These battles are fully immersive 3D affairs, with the camera closing in on the action and rotating around to get the best view.  Characters actually run in to strike their foes, then flee the area, apparently hoping to avoid retaliation.  The strong animation, the speed, and the sound effects, from stomping boss characters to the battle cries of your allies, manage to make the battles seem truly alive.  There's always so much going on, with multiple characters attacking at the same time, then the action freezing for you to input commands for the next character.  I could go on and on just watching the battles - something that's easy thanks to the included auto battle mode, where the computer takes control of the characters for you.  Most notable are the new call spells, which make use of pre-rendered CG full motion video atop the real-time scenery.  Much like the massive call-spells of Final Fantasy, these are an audio-visual feast, and ignoring a few compression artifacts here and there, blend nicely with the real time stuff.  The design of the spells is what impresses the most, as fire elementals and lighting elementals look the part.  A few of the spells actually tie into the game, from a story point of view.   Differences in presentation aside, Grandia's battle system is a work of genius.  There's so much strategy offered up due to the characters being placed on a visible timeline, as you're given ample means of playing around with the character positions.  Some attacks will knock an enemy back on the time line - an important strategy when facing off against a powerful foe, as you'd do best to keep him from attacking, seeing as how a single hit could nearly kill a character.  All attacks will freeze a character momentarily, a useful fact particularly when poisoned, as characters are being hit frequently, and are slowed down as a result.  Knocking an opponent back on the time line brings about a momentous feeling, especially when it occurs just as the opponent is attacking one of your allies.  The game slows down the action momentarily, and the rush is unmatched.   The skill system is strongly connected to the battle system in that by building a particular spell or battle skill in level, you can make that move faster in the heart of battle.  You build level by assigning points earned in battle to a particular skill or power up, and earn new spells or skills when a character is at sufficient level at previous skills.  Characters are actually equipped with magic and power-up items, this time around, so just as you'd equip armor or swords, you equip an HP power up which raises your HP by 100 points, or an agility power up which increases your speed considerably, or a magic orb (referred to as Mana Eggs) which gives the character various fire, thunder and water spell attacks.  Collecting and opening up all the magic and power ups becomes one of the goals for the game.  I'm not fully sure if I like the new skill system fully over the one found in the original Grandia. It does manage to solve the biggest problem from the original, as characters no longer need to go through the repetition of casting a single spell over and over again in order to gain an increase in level for that spell.  However, it looses the wonderful feeling of having a new spell appear out of nowhere in mid-battle - any new spell appears as you're assigning points after the battles.  Also, the skill system seems to be based too heavily on numbers and not the actual raising of characters.  However, I did find myself wanting to open up as many spells as I possibly could.  As for those very traditional pieces armor, swords, shields, etc - they don't seem to feature the same level of skill raising from the original, unfortunately, or at least I didn't notice anything of the form.  However, I found myself playing around with a character's equipment settings more than in any other RPG to date, as most equipment has some sort of side effect.  Some will recover your energy, magic, or skill points slowly in battle, with easily seen changes.  Others can be used as items, with Elena's staffs having healing effects and Ryudo's swords providing for some nasty elemental-based attacks.  And just as in the original, you're given ample room to play with the skill and battle system as a whole.  The enemy encounters in Grandia II are numerous enough to build up most every spell, although they aren't so numerous that you grow weary of the game.  Interested in maxing our your abilities?  Then head on out to the included optional special stage area (you have to open it up first) which features some tough enemies standing around in wait for the daring player.  So maybe the sense of adventure isn't as grand in the second Grandia.  The game at its heart is exceptional, and the story works out just fine in retrospect. With that in mind, you must pick up the game when it arrives in America - just prepare to ask some questions as you make your way from beginning to end.  -- Anoop Gantayat, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 22, 2000"}
