Apparently, interest in Peter Parker has not waned since the first film's $400+ million domestic box office. Indiagames and Activision have teamed up with Marvel to deliver the webslinger to mobile phones around the world, and we were quite anxious, in light of the new trailer, to take Peter for a spin.  Features:  Side-scrolling action Sling webbing Battle the Green Goblin  Spider-Man for the cellphone reminds us an awful lot of the only Spider-Man game on the SEGA Genesis. For us, this is a compliment, as that old Genny game was one of the few times Spidey received a decent vid treatment before Activision revived him a few years back on the original PlayStation.  Indiagame's take on the wallcrawler is a side-scrolling action game that almost demands to be played with a SNES or Genesis controller. Through five decently-detailed levels, you must take on common thugs and minions, fighting your way to a climactic showdown with the Green Goblin himself.  While fighting off legions of goons, you must also save innocents caught in the line of fire.  It's difficult to judge Spider-Man's looks, as Indiangames has done an excellent job optimizing the game for each phone. For example the game looks slightly underwhelming on a Motorola T720, but on the Nokia 3650, Spider-Man looks very impressive, with nicely-animated sprites and bright colors. So, temper your expectations based on the handset you own.  The gameplay itself is very, very straight-forward, but at least it's a little more involved than previous Marvel offerings, like Activision's X2 fighter and Universal's Fury of the Hulk puzzler. You just need to scramble from one end of the level to the other, avoiding enemy attacks and saving hostages. Simple, but simple is what you would expect from a handset game -- and remember, there was a time before Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metroid Prime, when all we had were simple games like this. Spider-Man is a very pleasant surprise, X2 andHulk, I was ready to give up on Marvel going mobile. However, Indiagames has crated a very solid side-scroller that evoked fond memories of the Genesis' halcyon days. The visuals are not quite up with Gameloft's amazing XIII or Prince of Persia, but they certainly shame 80% of current wireless titles. If you're even remotely into old-school fun and simple gameplay, Spider-Man weaves a tempting web.", "date": "Dec 16, 2003"}
