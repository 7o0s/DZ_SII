Never have I gotten so sweaty from playing a PlayStation game. I've been so accustomed to playing RPGs and strategy games for so long now that I honestly forgot how fun wrestling games really are -- and WCW Nitro is the best one yet.   WCW Nitro has more than 16 wrestlers to choose from including, Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Macho Man Randy Savage, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Syxx, Lex Luger, Giant, Diamond Dallas Page, Alex Wright, Booker T, Stevie Ray, Nature Boy Ric Flair, Dean Malenko, Eddy Guerrero, Chris Benoit, and everyone's favorite Crow impersonator, Sting. And for those who want more, THQ has added some secret characters in there as well. Oh yeah!  Each wrestler has over 30 moves to use against their opponent. Everything from suplexes to pile drivers to elbow smashes to leg drops, THQ has managed to add every move and taunt necessary to properly recreate a night of WCW Nitro in your own living room.  There are three different playmodes in WCW Nitro: tournament, exhibition, and my personal favorite, tag team. And although there's nothing like bashin' your buddy up with your two favorite wrestlers, mine being Sting and Macho Man, I do wish that THQ could've added a multi-player mode. Sports games are twice as fun when you're playing against a friend, but when you have four players bouncing around the room, the 'F' in fun immediately becomes capitalized.  THQ has even added  some of your all-time favorite music tracks from big bands like White Zombie and Korn. With good graphics and more than adequate gameplay, WCW Nitro is the best PlayStation wrestling that money can buy.
