But like its road racing cousin, the game has finally managed to find its way to the States.  So how did we feel about it? After spending a solid day playing the US version, we've found that while it may not be the most stunning racer on PlayStation, it certainly isn't dead in the water.  Gameplay is truly Turbo Prop's forte, although its control may not come easily to fans of traditional racing games. Frustrating even. But after roughly 15 minutes of play, it becomes second nature. Once mastered, the true fun begins.  Central to the game is an impressive water physics model. One through which wakes from opponents' boasts can slow you down, screwing up can send you flying into rocks, and finding the right current to follow (and keeping in it) is crucial to victory. Dual Shock feedback plays a major role in this; you can literally feel when you're not ~in the groove.~ These physics are what truly saves the game from ~just another racer~ status, instead delivering something truly unique.  The power-up system also plays an important role, and is equally well thought out. Green icons provide turbo boosts (three can be held at once), while red ones take away one turbo slot. It takes grabbing another green icon to free the space up. Blue icons provide a helpful ~time freeze~ which can provide an few crucial extra seconds to reach the next checkpoint. It's keeping away from the red icons, while grabbing the other, that makes the power-up system so intriguing.   Nine fully-customizable boats are to be had, although it would have been better if a ~race points~ system were used to purchase upgrade parts instead of the unusual method of obtaining five gold coins in each course, placing first, and then successfully completing a bonus round to get your upgrade.   Track selection is equally varied. Six courses appear in standard, nighttime, and mirrored variants. Placing first in all six standard course unlocks the nighttime tracks, and so on. Special daytime and nighttime championship circuits can also be unlocked, which function on a traditional race points system - the competitor with the most points at the end of six races wins. Easily the best feature to be unlocked, however, is a fractal track generator capable of creating unlimited course variants. Definitely a boost to the replay value.  Two-player split-screen (either horizontal or vertical) and a 3-5 player tournament mode boost lasting appeal as well.  Visually, the game is a mixed bag. While the high framerate and high-resolution graphics deliver a fast, clean look, draw-in, low track-side detail, and large amounts of clipping severely detract from what would otherwise be a very solid-looking game. It remains blindingly-fast at all times, albeit at a sacrifice.  On the audio side, the music isn't anything to write home about, and the announcer voice grates on your nerves after a few minutes of play. Thankfully the tunes can be turned down; if only we could say the same about the voice.  In the end, Turbo Prop Racing proves to be a worthy addition to any racing game fan's library - especially if you enjoyed the Wipeout series. It's not without flaws, but its better points are good enough to keep you playing from start to finish.  Randy Nelson", "date": "Aug 25, 1998"}
