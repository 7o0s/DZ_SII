The first question in my mind was: why?  The game in its console incarnations is not nearly as sophisticated as decent PC racing simulations.  However, EA has separate development shops for their F1 series, so perhaps the Le Mans PC title would incorporate a better physics and graphics engine and provide PC racing simmers with a quality title?  I sure hoped so.   For those that don't know, the 24 hours of Le Mans is an annual event run for 24 hours to see who can finish the most laps, and cars from different classes are on the track at the same time, trying to win their category and do as well outright as possible.  The long Le Mans track with its long fast straights is available, as are other tracks which race these kinds of cars, such as Road Atlanta, Suzuka and Donington, for a total of 12 tracks, but it's not actually 12 because they count the shorter variations of the tracks where you only race around half the track before it loops back around to meet up with the backside.   You can run championships, a semi-career mode where you unlock more and more cars and events, run quick races, and there is even multiplayer.  The time of day will change based upon the length of the race and the time scale you're racing in (you could race the full 24 hours of Le Mans in half an hour or so with the sky darkening and lightening fairly quickly).   At the end of the race you get as much of a replay as the game can store (i.e. although I haven't tried a full real-time 24 hour race, I feel pretty safe saying you won't get 24 hours of actual replays!).  The TV cameras look great and the race is fun to watch.  In fact, at times, you'd almost think you were watching the real thing.  However, you cannot save your replay, edit it, or control where you are in it.  So watch it all, or cut it short. Those are basically your options.   The game also offers over 70 cars, which it declares are incredibly detailed and officially licensed cars.  Yes, they are officially licensed, and for the most part they look right, mainly when they are really moving.  The game looks great for screenshots and when the cars are really doing things, especially in traffic.   Visually, there is some definite improvement over the console originals, particularly on replays, where you can see the cars driving by, their brake discs glowing, their tire logos spinning and spinning up smoke as brakes lock and unlock.  You can even see the driver inside his helmet as he roars by and there's a close up on his helmet.  Vapor trails come off the rear wings at high speed.  The courses also look as good as any title has created them.   The main innovations here involve the changing time of day, as the sun sinks low, the sky gets dark and slowly fills with stars, and lights around the track come on.  On Le Mans itself, a ferris wheel is lit up with a rotating red glow as you zoom by.   Of course, what I was really looking forward to was the car handling, while also hoping that a good force feedback wheel implementation had been done.  The game even promises on the back of the box that it incorporates ~award-winning physics~.  Well, I'm not sure just who gave them any awards for their console titles, though they were eminently playable and seemed realistic enough for what they were.  However, the PC version's physics are no better than identical to those on the console, but unfortunately, that is not the whole story.   The force feedback effects are mainly a rumble as you turn the wheel left and right past a certain threshold.  It feels almost like you're grinding the wheel as you turn it left and right.  There is no real variable resistance feel, or any sense that the forces are going to help you drive the car by letting it 'talk' to you about what it is doing.   The force feedback keeps running during replays, which really grates on me as the wheel just sits there and rumbles for no apparent reason.   Then there is the control (or lack thereof).  Imagine having to crank the wheel hard over to make even moderate swerves in the road.  That is about what happens here and is my number one complaint with the game.  The controls require far too much input, with little room for finesse or technique.   I went into the controller configuration and followed the instructions for tuning the steering ratio, dead zone and sensitivity to decrease the amount of steering input needed to get to full lock, but even with these settings pegged on either side of the spectrum, you still need armfuls of steering to negotiate even a moderate turn.  You don't really need to put much care into cornering.  Just don't brake too late and plow off the road.  Other than that you just crank the wheel hard over, push down the gas pedal, and off you go.     All of this was on the Expert handling mode, as well.  I would have figured this mode would be the most realistic handling they could offer, but it was flat and lifeless compared to the livelier titles like NASCAR 2002 by Sierra, or EA's F1 2002 on the PC.  You can put the pedal to the floor pretty quickly without any kind of wheel spin.  Running over the grass a bit just slows you down but doesn't spin you out or scare you in any real way.  There is no damage whatsoever so hitting someone just causes a bump and a jerk from the force feedback.    Even when the rear wheels break loose you don't need to compensate.  Just keep driving normally and they will re-plant in a second or so.   Initially the handling was so dulled that I lost the race just trying to stay on the track by driving the way I would expect to drive a real car.  After that debacle, I decided to give it all the lock necessary and floor the brakes at any point in the corner if I thought I was going too fast (something that is a definite no-no in a race car on the edge).  The game happily forgave this brutal handling and I easily knifed through the field in Normal difficulty to go from worst to first in a 3 lap quick race.  So much for this being a simulation with ~award-winning~ physics.  Instead, let's just be honest and call this an arcade racer and stop all this ~award-winning, real-world physics~ talk.  Perhaps there is a decent underlying physics engine, but if the controls are so clumsy, when would you ever find it.   What's sad is that while the game happens to have simulation quality graphics and presentation, it is a really shown to be a quickie port of the PS2 version, right down to the menus, setup screens, and even the choice of in-car views.  This means no cockpit view but rather a look over the hood with pixelated low-resolution textures painted on it.   One nice feature is the fully animated pit crew.  This is a nice enhancement over the console version, and definitely deserves mention as you see different angles of them changing the tires.  Although technically the ingredients for a great game are here, including long races with pits for tire, fuel and rudimentary setup options, the game fails at its most important job: the feel of driving.  There's no sense of grip being gained or lost, weight transfer, risk of damaging the car, or many other principles of racing.  You just bump your way through the field, slowing down enough so that a hard twist of the wheel will get you around the bends, and if it doesn't, you just mash the brakes, turn and continue.  In short, racing becomes rather boring quickly.Infogrames should really have done as EA did and spent time making a real Le Mans PC racing title, instead of just re-coding the console version albeit with poor control and force feedback.   My caveat here is that unlike a console title, Infogrames CAN change my mind (and score) somewhat with a patch that beefs up the physics, racing control and force feedback issues.  Driving a car at the limit should be challenging and require mental focus and a sense of balance and suspense.  They need to capture that.  After all, I have no serious gripes with the graphics, sound or presentation.  But the bottom line is that until you see that a patch is up and find that the flaws have been addressed, avoid this one.", "date": "Jul 1, 2002"}
