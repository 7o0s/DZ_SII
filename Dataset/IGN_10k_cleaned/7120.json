Whereas the pervious edition, the 2005 model marked a major leap in innovation and feature-rich game play, the current-year model is more of a slight hop. The core mechanics are still sound as ever, but missing is the absolute pop of last year's entry. There are dueling explanations for this, of course. One is that this is just a play for establishing yearly updates, since mobile games shuffle down the decks rather quickly these days. The other is that Gameloft has possibly pushed mobile baseball as far as it thinks it needs to go, offering a solid war between the pitcher and batter, the inclusion of manual fielding (missing from some yesteryear packages), and a tight bit of presentation that the game maker is known for.   Jeter does not employ a full league license. The teams and players -- with the exception of Jeter, naturally -- are made-up ball squads assigned to North American cities. Whether or not the lack of an MLB license effects the emotional connection between fan and the sport remains up to debate. Baseball, with its storied history as the national pastime occupies a very romantic place in the character of fans, and even many non-fans, such as myself.   The great showdown between batter and pitcher is augmented in Jeter by the addition of power play and even greater control over the placement of the ball. As a batter, you can hold the button down to ~charge up~ a stronger hit, as well as try and direct it toward different parts of the ballpark, purposefully try to sail it over heads and roll it along the grass as a grounder. There is a nice strategic wrinkle offered by this upgrade, and with the computer AI making full use of it, you better embrace it yourself to survive at anything but the easiest difficulty setting.   Pitchers come to the mound with a select group of throws, and you can position the pitch inside a useful box. This mechanic has been seen in previous baseball games on mobile and console, and its return is more than welcome. When winding up for the pitch, an on-screen meter fills to determine power, and then recedes for accuracy. Slight problem: The meter system is just too easy on mobile, what with its on-off controls (no degree of analog). If you know your handsets, clicking at just the right time to see solid 80-percent or more supply of perfect pitches. After a practice game, you'll suddenly be an expert pitcher, firing fastballs over the plate in the corner of the strike zone with surgical precision.   Fielding and baserunning requires a solid knowledge of your handset, too, since Gameloft has mapped many commands to the number keys. This isn't unnecessarily complicated, as it offers you greater control over the action. In a useful addition, you can put fielding into auto-mode, but instantly turn it off by assuming control of the action with the press of a number key. Picking off stealers is assigned to the bottom keys, advancing players is mapped to the number keys that correspond to base positions.   The core baseball game is still very strong and it plays remarkably well -- just like last year, but the new control and mechanical additions are solid. Gameloft sweetens the deal by adding a new homerun derby mode, where you must advance through a series of dinger contests. This is a fun little add-on, but like the pitching meter, it gets too easy too soon as soon as you have your fingers trained to the timing of the throws. You can select where you want to hit the ball, and it's not uncommon to go on a five or six hit run.   The stat tracking back-end of Jeter is serviceable for fans of that kind of minutiae. The game includes a quick play mode for a fast match, an exhibition game where you can select teams and adjust rule sets, go into a ~full~ season (choose between 29 and 58 games), or leap right into the play-offs. Game tweaks include the number of innings per game, AI difficulty, etc.   Gameloft sent me an LG VX7000 to test Jeter. The game looks good, with sizeable batter and pitcher sprites with a nice series of animations. Fielders and runners occupy boxes in the outer rim of the screen when in play, also complete with animations. The stadium has a solid amount of detail, and the crowd gets into the action. The baseball game itself is punctuated by riffs from the classic sports staple ~History of Rock and Roll,~ which is certainly authentic, but really -- who wants to hitch their wagon to Gary Glitter's star right now?  Gameloft's updated baseball game is an improvement over last year's edition, complete with refined controls that grant you greater influence over the mechanics of baseball. The 2006 edition lacks the major ~pop~ that came with last year's huge evolutionary release, but that doesn't discount Jeter's playability in the least. And it's important to note that Jeter is not the only baseball game coming this year -- EA Mobile will have one in a few months. If you're desperate for a mobile baseball, by all means buy Jeter without hesitation. But if you can wait, let's see how the other baseball games shake out.", "date": "Aug 9, 2006"}
