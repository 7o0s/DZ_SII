Originally released on the Apple II back in the Victorian days of the computer industry, Lode Runner found its way onto green and amber-lit monitors across the globe. With single-minded, challenging gameplay and a few cool options, like the ability to design your own levels, the game made a lasting impression on me. I can remember playing the game at a friend's house for hours, marveling at the changing levels and falling men.  Now the game is on the PlayStation. Imagine my excitement when I heard the game was being redone! Instead of revamping the game for a 3D age, or even redoing the graphics, however, publisher Natsume has had the game ported from two early-'90s PC versions of the game, The Legend Returns and Extra. These games look identical to the original Apple version with the exception that they're in color. Hardly the big upgrade I was hoping for.  Big upgrade or not, though, Lode Runner always has been about gameplay. It stars a lone running man, who's being chased up and down ladders and across platforms in his thirst to collect gold. Get all the gold and he moves on to the next level. The only weapon the runner has to protect himself against the red, chasing men is a flame-thrower (a shovel in the original). By burning holes in the ground, the runner can capture his enemies. After a time, the holes close up, but the men always return.  Lode Runner was one of the first games to feature multiple screens, and this aspect hasn't changed either. The playing field is made up of platforms of dirt and ladders to connect them, as well as things like ropes to swing across. Unfortunately, the characters in the game are extremely tiny, which makes it tough to see on smaller screens. The enemies are just red sprites with little definition as well -- they're not even outlined.  The CD contains the two aforementioned Lode Runner games, plus a Construction mode, enabling you to make your own levels. This was undoubtedly the coolest part of the original game and is still fun. Place the gold and as many enemies as you like before running through the level yourself.  So this is what it comes down to: do you love Lode Runner? If so, you're going to want to pick this game up, as it's just what you remember. However, if you don't give a crap about retro-gaming and could care less about this game, don't bother.
