{"name": "Shadow Man", "name_review": "Shadow Man", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/08/27/shadow-man-3", "text": "If you've read the Shadow Man comic book, you've probably been wondering what kind of a game Acclaim would create out of it -- like most movies, video games usually veer far away from the properties on which they are based. Shadow Man the game may not follow the plotlines of the comic series very closely, particularly the focus on Deadside, but it captures the horror of the series without fail. Acclaim not only failed to back down, but keeps the content in the game shocking, pulsating, and most of all, very gory. But the question is, do Shadow Man's adventures live up to the dark world he's trying to live in?  You play as Mike LeRoi, a man with a valuable lesson for all of us -- don't mess with black voodoo. After getting protective help from a Bokor (a voodoo priest), Mike quickly found out that the price for a priest's services was higher than bucket seats at a Ferrari dealership, namely eternal service. Mike was ~freed~ by a dying voodoo priestess who planted the Mask of Shadows in his chest, and cast him as her personal warrior. And it only gets worse. Now the voodoo priestess has had a premonition about the end of the world, and it's up to you to put a stop to it. As Mike you must travel to the Asylum, where all killers go when they die, and make things right. Find Legion, the master of Asylum, and his band of serial killers loose in the real world before the prophecy of Armageddon comes true.  The game flips between the real world (Liveside) and the world of shadows (Deadside) where Mike takes on the voodoo persona of Shadow Man. You'll quickly find that there isn't much difference in taste or style, despite the location. Acclaim Studios' creation is covered in black silk from start to finish, and other than the opening bayou scenery, you won't be gazing at the environments without a certain sobering chill. You spend a majority of the game in the morbid world of Deadside, but when you do peek your head back into the real world, some of the sights are even more disturbing. This game is not for the meek, or the weak of stomach. If you consider the original Hellraiser a romantic comedy though, this may just be your messiah.  The game captures the appeal of the grotesque like no other, including Half-Life. Textures in Deadside are based on skin and tissue, while characters consistently have the tasty look of flayed flesh roasted on an open fire, and then boiled until salty. The skies are menacing and dark, and filled with flying creatures that will pay you a more personal visit as you progress farther into Deadside. Victorian-era architecture is mixed with a heavy dose of gore, particularly in the Asylum, where puffed velvet gondolas transport you to blood-filled sanitarium hallways. Portals to Liveside are portrayed as torsos with flaming, open ribcages, chained from the ceiling -- and wait until you see the headless torsos and blood-strewn prison walls they lead you to. Turn a corner, and you'll get a personal view of the rivers of blood, filled with flesh-eating fish. There aren't a huge variety of enemies, but they've been crafted to ensure that once you meet them, you'll never forget it. Hook-handed sadists squeal like pigs (complete with sampled pig noises), while hooded dogs yelp like muffled humans when shot. Moaning zombies may seem innocent, but turn your back and they'll suck the life out of you (literally). Finish off any of your enemies with your Shadow Gun, and you'll be treated to some of the most horrifying screams you've ever heard before they explode, inside out, in a bath of blood and flesh. The creature design is flawless, but human characters seem to come off the worst, with a block, stick-figure design that turns what are supposed to be ~normal~ people into odd freaks. It's a minor gripe, but I kept hoping that maybe the dead souls that Shadow Man collects in the game would make their way into his frighteningly absent stomach.  Part of the whole fear-factor of the game can be contributed to the sound team, who has created some of the best soundscapes since the original Exorcist. Two-headed zombies whisper your name as they come at you on their legless torsos, while weapons like the Shadow Gun seem to actually scream with power as you launch bullets. The music provides most of the atmosphere in the game, especially with tricks such as looping the laughter of children ever-so-softly in the background of a brooding theme, or adding moans, screams, and chainsaw sounds to a gothic playground song. It's not exactly the kind of thing you'd want to pop into your home stereo, and it's all the better for it.  Shadow Man controls similar to most third-person keyboard shooters, with the brilliant exception of targeting, a skill which allows him to lock-on to an enemy while firing. He has the ability to hold two weapons at once, which fire independently (and target separate creatures, if you're far enough away from them). His weapons range from guns (his pistol can be used in Deadside, while machine guns and others cannot) to voodoo weapons like the Flambeau and the Asson, which unleash different brands of fire on your enemies. You also collect Gads, special tattoos which will allow you to gain access to special fire-retarding powers. Overall the gameplay is definitely of the standard run-and-jump variety, with a lot of action thrown in to keep your trigger finger busy. Sometimes the game does dissolve into corridor hell, but there's enough variety that you can always look forward to new puzzles and tricks within the environments of Deadside.  Most of the game revolves around collecting dark souls before Legion does, to stop the prophecy. In terms of actual gameplay, dark souls give Shadow Man the ability to add to his Shadow Level, which will allow him to open special doors and access new areas of Deadside. You'll spend the majority of the game seeing Dark Souls in obscure areas of the map, and trying to track them down to open a new door. Most of the time, this means that you'll run through a new area, become stuck, then have to go back through every earlier area to find out what exactly you missed, killing enemies all the way to and from the areas. The lock-on feature makes slaying enemies a smooth process, but unfortunately, you have to shoot them so many times that by the end, you don't care. Add to that the endless cavalcade of villains and after a few hours you'll find yourself running around avoiding fights because you simply don't want to take the hours to kill each and every one of them. As you get more powerful weapons the process gets a lot easier, but it's still a much more elaborate process than most games, and around for no apparent reason other than to lengthen the gameplay.  Even with a printed map and the ability to warp using the Baton and a worn teddy bear (long story), the game can become confusing beyond belief. The playrooms (a gross mix of playgrounds, torture chambers, and breeding grounds), for instance, are filled with a myriad of hidden passageways and doors, without any sort of in-game guidance. You end up running around for hours in circles repeating the same tasks in the hope of finding a clue, a vision of hell not meant by the designers. Too often the game comes down to finding the right item or the right door at a specific time, without any hints on what that object or door is. Exploring levels is fun the first time, but running through a level for the 32nd looking for the one door you could swear you saw four hours ago isn't. It's especially sad given that with the graphic and sound quality so high, you should never have to sigh about having to revisit an area. The focus of the game is supposed to be freedom of exploration, which works sometimes, but other times creates some odd messes. For instance, Peer Schneider from IGN 64 and I were trading notes about the game, and found out that while I found powers he had never found in the game, he was stuck on a completely different section -- and neither of us had any idea that we had missed something. I missed finding a tiny pathway which ended up opening into an entire temple, which would have given me a much more powerful weapon hours earlier in my progress. Peer was stumped on the getting the Poigne, wristlets which allowed him to climb rivers of blood. The map helped a lot in getting to major locations, but with each place a web of passageways, it rarely helped in actually finding an object or passageway. With only vague, broad clues on how to tackle major moments in the game, too many times it would turn into a game of hide and seek.  Shadow Man is scary, dense, and full of surprises -- but like a lot of huge projects, is overwhelmed by its own size. Between all the action and exploration is a lot of hoofing and hair-pulling, and though it by no means crushes the game, it does keep the game from its full potential. Instead of leaving you wanting more, in a sense the designers have given you too much. The exciting moments make the game worth playing though, and with some helpful hints the adventure is large enough to give you some entertainment for more hours than I'd like to think about. Shadow Man's adventures in Deadside may not be a completely new concept in terms of gameplay, but its fun, twisted, and definitely worth the visit.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Aug 27, 1999"}
