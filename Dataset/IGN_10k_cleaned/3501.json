But during the process of reducing the elaborate console game design for the much less capable GBA hardware, a lot was lost in the translation. The portable rendition of the series is not a whole lot of fun to play due to the extremely limited gameplay elements paired up with the lack of features. Features All major league players and teams Password save Only for Game Boy Advance  The game does look rather nice, we'll give it that. The developers worked the graphics and user interface style of the console versions of Slugfest on the Game Boy Advance. Players in the pitching interface are large and well animated, with the fielders and runners idly swaying back and forth during a pitch. Hit the ball out in the field and the action switches to an overhead view of the action, with animated glowing trails swooping off the ball during a hit and throw. The overhead engine is a little choppy during the fast motion during a mighty powerful hit, but honestly that's the least of the problems of Slugfest.  We all know that this is an arcade-style rendition of baseball. But just because it's not supposed to be ~realistic~ doesn't mean that the designers had to remove everything fun about baseball videogames. In SlugFest 2004, players in the field don't actually field for the ball; the computer does all that work itself. When the opponent hits the ball into the outfield, the computer has the closest player run and catch the ball. All the player actually does is throw the ball to the proper base. And that's pretty much the entire gameplay on defense in SlugFest, which reduces the potential fun dramatically.  There are several other gameplay oddities players will discover in SlugFest 2004. A hit pop-fly foul ball will instantly put a stop to the play, even if a fielder has a chance to catch it for an out. Double-plays are almost an impossibility in this game because players can't get the throw off quickly enough; the ball won't leave until the player's lengthy throw animation cycle ends, which gives runners plenty of time to get to the bag. Ball physics are pretty lousy, hitting the ground like a lead weight in mud...but since players barely do any fielding work, it's an issue that more appears odd than affects the overall gameplay. Computer batters occasionally get into a strange rut of constantly starting their swing as soon as the pitch is thrown, which makes some strike-outs happen by default. And there have been instances where a force-out wouldn't register at the bag; in these situations, the fielder has to run off the bag to tag the runner.  Most importantly, there's just a distinct lack of features in Slugfest 2004. Without internal cartridge save, gamers can't save earned statistics or work their way through a standard season like the console versions. And this baseball title doesn't include link-cable support, so forget about playing with a friend on another system...this is a solitaire sports outing. SlugFest on the Game Boy Advance isn't nearly as bad as Midway's attempts at the Blitz series on the handheld, but there have been so many corners cut in features that this baseball title just isn't very fun to play. The developer worked to get the looks and sounds of the console version on the GBA, but they didn't capture the gameplay. Even though the intention is to present a more action-packed, over-the-top baseball game, the team just didn't succeed. SlugFest 2004 can't compete with the other portable baseball games, both past and present.", "date": "Mar 18, 2003"}
