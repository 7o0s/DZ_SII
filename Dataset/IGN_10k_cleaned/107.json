The devourer of ghosts and his family line had starred in a number of videogames, appeared on countless amounts of merchandise, and even appeared in a mildly popular Saturday morning cartoon. However, Pac's maze-chase formula began to lose its iron grip on arcades thanks to the successful rise of a number of genres, such as the shooter or the platformer. Enter Pac-Land, a side-scrolling departure from the Pac-Man tradition that plays like a response to changing tastes in the landscape rather than a legit effort to take Pac-Man in new directions.   Pac-Land originally debuted in arcades before making several trips to home systems, such as the Commodore 64 and the NES. Of the numerous ports, the 1990 TurboGrafx-16 edition hews closest to the arcade game. In this platformer, Pac runs from left to right across a series of stages set in a variety of locations such as a bustling metropolis, a desert, a forest, and a haunted mansion. Along the way, Pac must jump over or generally avoid the ghosts that once chased him around mazes.   Pac can pick up a number of little power-ups and the game is laden with secrets. Since this is Pac-Man we're talking about, there are power pills that turn the tables on the ghosts and fruit that add bonus points. While running through the stages, though, try pushing against items such as fire hydrants to uncover secrets, like helmets and an upside-down Pac. The Galaxian ship is even tucked away in here, and drops a fat point bonus in your bank if uncovered. There's also a clever little jumping secret at the end of each stage. If you jump up and down at the exact right spot, you get a victory dance point surge.   Pac-Land is not a terribly difficult game, but I think that is by design and not a flaw. The entire time just seems so congenial, so eager to please that it doesn't risks offending the player with serious challenge. Since the Pac-Man in Pac-Land is pulled from the artwork on the side of older arcade games -- long nose, big pie-shaped eyes -- killing him off seems much more egregious.   Left: Pac-Land on TG-16, Right: Pac-Land in American arcades  Interestingly, the Turbo version of the game released in America does not opt for the artwork used in Midway's arcade release -- it uses the original Japanese version from Namco. Midway had the Pac-Man family changed to look like the aforementioned Saturday morning cartoon. His nose is a little snub and his eyes are white instead of black pies. The game does, though, use music from the cartoon show -- although, by 1990, the cartoon was largely forgotten by younger players.   (You can download episodes of the cartoon serial on XBLA, if you are so inclined. Check it out -- it's a nice little relic from the videogame-to-cartoon experiment that took over Saturday mornings for a while.)  Pac-Land is a harmless game that feels like an effort to keep Pac-Man alive and relevant instead of a real-deal game. The bright, day-glo graphics are certainly pleasing and add to the overall pleasantness of Pac-Land. Because the game offers so little challenge, it's hard to recommend as a gotta-have to the hardcore, but should definitely be in the library of any self-respecting Pac fan.", "date": "Mar 31, 2008"}
