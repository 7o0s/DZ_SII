Any team that would have the gumption to create a survival horror game based on a virus that turns its victims into maniacal primates obviously has a giant set of brass ones. Based on a very successful line of horror movies out of Japan, The Ring: Terror's Realm attempts to nab the gothic adventure gauntlet that Resident Evil: Code Veronica left behind. Unfortunately, the only thing that The Ring may truly nab is a trip back to the store for an exchange or total refund.  The story begins with the mysterious murder of a scientist named Robert. Boyfriend to our eventual heroine Meg, Bobby fell victim to a strange sort of attack that left his body a dried and lifeless husk. On her way over for a date, Meg is horrified as she discovers that Robert's home has become a buzzing crime scene rife with police. Pushing her way through cop after cop (yeah that's right, there's two of them), our not-so-brainy girlfriend discovers her oh-so-dead man in a grizzly fashion. Comforted by neighbor and friend Jack, (presented in stereo with the worst sissy-boy voice acting I have ever heard in a video game) Meg mourns the passing of her beau by doing what any person in her shoes would do... she takes over his research job at the local CDC virus laboratory the day after his death.  Once she arrives at her new workplace, Meg quickly exposes further details surrounding the demise of her shoogy-lumps. After a phone call from the world's most feminine Y-Chromosome Jack, Meg learns that Robert wasn't the only member of the lab to perish (two security guards were also taken from this mortal coil). The weird part is that all of them died at the exact same time. Even stranger is that all three men were running a secretive computer program called [RING] while they expired. Meg shortly discovers thereafter that the program is still up and running on Robert's desk and hastily investigates. Sucked into a virtual reality simulation game, our wonder woman adeptly finds herself outfitted with body armor and equipped with a gun. Accompanied by a similarly clad mystery man, Meg is given a tutorial on how to play the game and sent to destroy ~THEM~ without another word.  Okay now, I'll admit it from the start, the beginning of the game really had me intrigued. Certainly on the original side when compared to most other survival horror games, The Ring was taking a fresher approach than I'd seen before. Now sure, the voice acting had been recorded in a back alley somewhere. And granted, the full-motion video was far from impressive, but hey! Adventure games are all about the stories and characters right? So I was perfectly willing to give this one a chance... it's just too bad that it didn't deliver what I hoped. A mess of troubles and control problems, The Ring stinks of unfinished business.  To begin with the visuals are just plain silly. Every character you stumble across, be it Jack, Meg, or ~supporting character number five~, look like they haven't been to a chiropractor for centuries. Hunched over like Quasimodo, the curiously statured cast casually moves along the corridors of the office building like Shaggy from Scooby Doo.  It's hard to get spooked when you can't stop laughing at the appearance of your fellow egg heads dragging their knuckles on the floor. Also unnerving has to be the poor detail in hairstyles and facial features.  Most of the human characters can't stop grinning, and mange to resemble the test subjects of Smilex from the first Batman film. What the hell are they so happy about? There's a killer virus out there and monkey-people are taking over the world!  One visual the developers did get right however were the lighting effects. Powered in real-time, the overhead lamps, flashlights, and illuminated door signs flush the room with flare and shadows as they would in reality. And despite our main characters Tabasco bottle-like silhouette, the rest of the darkened areas looked pretty convincing. Adding a bit of a twist to the game play as well, your character's strategy in a lit and darkened room can also be affected as certain enemies hate the light, while others crave it. A truly surprising moment is when a critter you didn't think was there pops out of nowhere the instant you first turn on the flashlight! The effect that light and dark have on the world of The Ring is definitely one of its high points.  Of course the most obvious nitpick is of the aural variety. As not only does the voice acting I mentioned earlier climb the peaks of putrefaction, but so too does the sound effects. Taken right from your garden variety sound bank o' rama, the blips, blasts, and booms you're exposed too have all been heard before. To increase the annoyance factor that extra mile, there's even a fair share of pops and hiss in the audio. If ever there was a question as to whether or not an old .45 LP could successfully be used as a source for sound... here's your answer.  Musically The Ring fares a tad better. The title track and a couple of other select pieces actually provide a nice distraction to some of the games shortcomings. Additional songs however (like most of the basement themes and the headache inducing office track) may lead some of you to either mute the television set or pop a couple of valium. Whichever method you select, know ahead of time that there is no absolutely escaping one of those ultimatums or a facsimile thereof.  Another major problem comes in terms of pacing. While crafting a survival horror game these days seems to be getting easier as time wears on, getting it right appears to be a harder and harder proposition. Revealing the plot and its twists at just the right time (while successfully providing an exciting game play experience in-between snippets of FMV) is the preverbal holy grail. An accomplishment that Asmik almost succeeds in with the beginning, only to falter as the end draws to its conclusion.  The first three hours or so seemed to race by quicker than I expected, and I had a few moments there where I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. But right around that four hour mark, I started to grow tired of hopping between the two realities while blasting the different varieties of monkey. The longer the game went on (you're looking at about 10 to 12 hours of adventure from beginning to end), the more I wanted it to be over. Plot devices that were easy to figure out in the first half of the game were being revealed in the second half like we hadn't heard them before. Item retrieval missions that became more and more vague slowed my progress down to almost a standstill. And while I ran around the complex revisiting rooms I had already been too, I kept hoping to myself that something interesting would happen to grab me like it did when I first started... but it didn't.  What's worse, is that the list of troubles doesn't end there. Terrible collision detection left me pressing the action button twenty to thirty times before I could find the exact dot I needed to retrieve particular items. I would frequently glitch the camera and disappear and reappear to different spots of the same corner if I got too close to a barrier or an object. Auto-aiming wouldn't do its job too often to tell, as a creature would stand right there in front of me while my bullets mystically flew through its body without leaving any trace of damage. And finally, by the time I had completed the story I was left wondering what had happened to a entire slew of supporting characters. They had just spent the whole game as either a thorn in my side or as an ally helping me whenever I needed it, only to vanish into obscurity with the ending. What was the point of setting up a story like this if you don't follow up on it?  I just can't help but to think what could have been if a little more time was spent ironing out details in the plot while refining the other categories. The lowest rung on the ladder of Dreamcast survival horror games, The Ring: Terror's Realm is just an average jaunt into the dark side. Perhaps with Infrogrames next try at the genre (Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare) a qualified follow-up to Capcom's Code Veronica will finally be realized. Until then, I suggest you stick with Claire and Steve for a much better (and ultimately more satisfying) fright-filled experience.  -- Jeremy Dunham, IGNDC", "date": "Aug 23, 2000"}
