The PlayStation is years old, and Tomb Raider has returned with its fourth game in around as many years. The last couple of holiday seasons have seen the release of a new Lara adventure, right on time for the lucrative shopping season. You've got to hand it to those designers at Core -- they certainly have the development cycle down pat by now. I remember playing the first Tomb Raider all the way through in a frenzy, addicted to the fact that yes, those were some huge damn caves, and yes again, you could explore every inch of them. No one had really tried to mimic real environments before, and Core really captured something -- obviously. The game blew up like a Nuclear Bomb, and here we are with not only a game, but a phenomenon. I purchased the second game the day it came out, and also played it all the way through, though with a lot more effort. I kept waiting for the magic to hit me again, but all I saw were familiar (if not comfortable) sights, sounds, and action. We're not even going to go into the problems that plagued the third game in the series -- but let's just say that it took the term tedious to new heights. We're back where we started with The Last Revelation, and for those of us that have played every game in the series, it feels like nostalgic territory, emulating the same sort of feelings of the original. Unfortunately, memories are best kept at that, and actually playing through TLR feels like the gaming equivalent of dusting off old photos and staring at the faded pictures. But Eidos hasn't made this for us, and one play through the game proves that if anyone has been watching the flood of new casual gamers hitting the PC marketplace, Eidos has.  To re-open any sort of sexist debate when it comes to Tomb Raider would be pointless -- so all I'm going to say is that nothing has changed. I don't find it inflammatory that after the whole fight against the Nude Raider codes and websites that Eidos would then turn around and include insert photos of a topless Lara on the inside of its CD cover. I'm not even surprised that Lara's gotten smooth and detailed enough to show that not only are her shorts tight, but that they actually crawl up into the crack of her ass. What I'm much more annoyed by is the fact that Eidos has gone through four iterations of this game without changing the slightest gameplay detail. They've added locations, thrown in a couple of vehicles, but at its core the graphics look dated, the levels are still the same ~pull switch and run through door~ formula, and she still controls like a rusty tank. Even Tomb Raider's own Eidos cousin Soul Reaver found a way to at least tweak control issues in the same sort of formula -- but Core and Eidos seem almost scared to touch the slightest detail of the TR series for fear that they may sabotage whatever it is makes the series so successful.   In its defense, Eidos and Core have delivered exactly what they promised, a return to the original Tomb Raider. The elaborate door puzzles and confusing levels from TR3 have been toned down, and a large plot now threads the levels together. The movies which introduce the levels are some of the best FMV storytelling I've seen in a long time, so good in fact that they outshine the levels themselves in terms of action, adventure, and intrigue. A nemesis has been created that adds greatly to the TR lore (Von Croy, Lara's old instructor), and he's as nastily polite and Lara is politely heroic. The storyline concerns a horrible mistake -- Lara takes the ankh in the tomb of the Egyptian god Seth, and inadvertently brings about the destruction of the world as we know it. All she has to do is return the ankh and every will return to normal -- that is, until Von Croy gets involved. The plot is revealed in slices, and feels completely fresh when compared to Tomb Raider's earlier plotlines, which were mainly attempts to piece together the locations with a stitched storyline. It feels great, the voice acting is tight, and it sets the mood for the game perfectly. Then, you actually have to play the game.  There are moments when the game looks completely new, especially when looking at the more detailed character models, but anyone with a keen eye will notice that the levels are still of the same beast as all the other Raider games. Blocky objects still abound, and texture seams are everywhere. Though the quality of the textures has gotten better, they're still miles behind when compared to any of the current hits on the market, like Unreal, Quake III, Wheel of Time, and Rayman 2. There are some definite improvements, however -- though the other characters are still blocky and chunky, a lot of time and effort has been spent ensuring that Lara looks the best that she's ever looked. Her hair is still flopping and flying around like the real thing, and this time around, she actually sheds water droplets after emerges from the water. In terms of graphic tricks, the lighting effects are incredibly well done in the game, and are shown off by flames, flares, and dark, musty caverns. All of the lighting is rich, colorful, and beautiful, easily the most captivating part of the game this time around, especially when you get into the darker, torch-lit caverns.   Sound wise, effects have been lifted directly from the other Tomb Raider games, with new variants on the same incidental music theme. Voice acting is still of very high quality, and Lara's dialogue is still as charming and bratty as ever. Speaking of uh, speaking, Lara still doesn't get the opportunity to interact with characters in her environment, though there are times when an in-game cutscene is triggered by reaching a certain area or person. Quick cutscenes introduce new areas, and give hints as to where Lara should go next -- a sort of visual map, which helps levels from becoming too confusing. You're still left running and crawling through long hallways only to find a locked door, but at least the dead-end ratio is lessened by the cutscene help.  In terms of actual moves, the only really new tricks up her sleeve are the ability to swing on ropes, and use a gun sight. Being able to jump and grab switches, climb up poles, and put together two sides of a mask don't count as new features in my opinion, and let's not even go into the ~big~ change in the inventory screen from circular to horizontal. Thanks to Lara's hair technology, the ropes are the best I've even seen in the game, acting like you'd expect ropes to act and react. Though she doesn't pull any elaborate tricks with the ropes, they're still fun to play around with, and swing on, especially if you've been sneaking games of Donkey Kong 64 on the side, like I have. The scope isn't used throughout the game, but they've provided a couple of enemies (such as the skeleton's I'm sure you've seen in the demo) that take a head shot to eliminate. Though I would have like to use the mouse to control the site, it still works fairly well with a keyboard. Actually getting around, however, is a completely different story. Though she's got the dash from TR3, she still moves so slow that even fun puzzles are slowed down to molasses by the simple process of having to navigate environments at the speed of a snail. Try turning around while crawling in a tight space (which you'll have to do), and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Some ideas are inventive, such as the gigantic cylindrical room that rotates when you pull switches, and the tombs filled with flesh eating insects that chase you relentlessly, but in the end, everything comes down to pulling switches, and opening doors. Some moments are visually arresting, such a spherical room with gigantic blades that slash periodically, or the sight of a moving train full of baddies. Like some sort of anti-fun magnet though, new environments inevitably turn back to the same old process of TR exploration. Every time that you even think there might be a new experience around the corner -- nope, there's that switch, glaring at you. And usually, it's behind a reeeeaaally long hallway which is behind another locked door.   Levels take place mainly in Egyptian ruins, with special events putting her on a moving train, or in a sunken palace. TLR has none of the variety of TR3 in terms of location, but it also has none of the frustration, either. Bigger blades, larger pits, and a set of costumed enemies are all ready to do her in, like before, as well as even more puzzles and switches just waiting to give her a brain hemorrhage. Some of the puzzles seem more oblique than ever, unfortunately, such as the torch puzzle in the first level. See those lit platforms? You may not know it, but you have to jump on them in order, and exactly in the middle in order to trigger the door. Too bad there's no click or clue to let you know you're doing anything right -- and even when you land on a platform, it sometimes won't register because you didn't land precisely in the center. The biggest relief in TLR is just its lack of size, which makes environments much easier to navigate mentally. There isn't a strict level structure per se, which means that the designers have squeezed and shaped environments into odder sizes this time, which is more than welcome, in my opinion. You're never working from one end of a level to another as obviously, which makes things a bit more seamless than the general aimlessness that plagued TR3.  Other levels, like the jeep chase, feel like a more honed version of the TR3 vehicles, keeping the fun, as well as some of the frustration. For me, it was mainly bent around the fact that although the manual said the exit key was END, in reality, it was MASH A BUNCH OF KEYS TOGETHER UNTIL YOU EXIT. Speaking of glitches, seeing as how this engine is very, very similar to TR3's, you can still expect some confusing camera angle problems (despite the new transparent trick which lets the camera flip behind Lara when she's close to walls), as well the same problems with edge detection, and character models peeking through walls and floors. Other than these glitches, the game runs very smoothly, and should be easy for most gamers to pick up and run with. Though it's nothing original, the levels are in the same vein as TR1, which means slow-paced environments, but an adventure that's more than playable. Though the announcement of a new Tomb Raider game months ago was received with a collective groan by members of the gaming press, I can't say that this game is horrible. In fact, it isn't bad at all -- it is just in no way original, and more than that, it's not original three times over. There's no way I could slam this game by saying that it's Tomb Raider again, so therefore it sucks -- there's still a lot of the charm that made it a hit in the first place -- but I'd be kidding myself and everyone else if I even tried to defend the game as more of what we love most. It's not, and that's why, unless someone actually decides to tweak knob at the Tomb Raider offices, this game will be firmly planted in the murky world of average until something changes.  The most interesting thing about TLR is that this game is ultimately not left for us, the hardcore gamers, to play. The proof is in the structure. This time around, there's no tutorial. Instead, the entire first level is an incredibly boring (for those that know how to use the controls, anyway) version of the training level, which takes place when Lara is 16. Though it pushes the plot forward, most gamers other than ones playing the game for the first time will find the level to be an exercise in butter knife type dullness. The cutscene help, the elaborate tutorial -- these are all squarely pointed at the new set of consumers heading to the PC this year that have never played Tomb Raider before, and might just start with this one. I recommend that completely -- this is an emulation of the first adventure, with some spruced up graphics, which is fine for those that are new to the world of Croft. But for those of us have been on trips with her before... a different story. You know what? It may not even matter. Lara Croft is such an incredibly strong franchise by this point that critics could light it on fire in protest, and it would still sell into the millions on console and PC formats. We may feel that Lara has deserted us for the big bucks, and mainstream success, but to her owners, she's reaching the largest audience she's ever had a chance to reach this year.  Yes, it's as good as the first one, but even so, if this was Tomb Raider 2 instead of 4, it would still be criticized for bringing nothing new to the table. And years after the fact? It's just unacceptable. There's a reason why the Core team can release a new TR game ever year on the dot, while other companies struggle to stick to release dates -- they don't spend very much time on design. Though levels have some new tricks in every iteration, they still rely on a massive amount of recycled material in order to keep the game alive, and for those of us that used to have an active interest in the series, it has done nothing but ruin any respect that Tomb Raider used to garner. If you've never, ever -- not once, not even for a second, played Tomb Raider, than this should be the one to start with. The tutorial will teach you the controls thoroughly, and the levels are just as good as the first Tomb Raider's. But for anyone who's played more than one Tomb Raider, this one isn't worth the trouble. Maybe its the fact that TR is still tightly tied with the dated PlayStation, or maybe its just pure greed, but either way, it looks like Tomb Raider isn't going to change any time soon. The game plays just well enough to keep players interested, and at this point, that's all that matters. What can fans of Lara do? Hope that with the release of the PlayStation 2, that the PC version and the console versions will finally get a much-needed facelift.  -- Vincent Lopez", "date": "Dec 11, 1999"}
