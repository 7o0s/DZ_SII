Basically, this game kicks ass!  Stunned by an awesome intro filled with rendered jets, Ace Combat 2 is an action packed flight simulator that allows a player to take control of some of the most powerful military jets in the world. One of them is the F-14, but a Stealth Bomber is our favorite.  When it comes to graphics, Namco has gone all out. Ace Combat 2 possesses some of the cleanest polygons ever to grace the PlayStation. This game possesses fully rendered levels ranging from submarine infested oceans, to anti-aircraft plastered canyon trenches.  Now we all know how famous Namco is for making its games look nice, but how does it play? Suprisingly, this game plays exceptionally well. Fight physics are true to the sky and the enemy AI has been tuned to a new a level.  The only complaint that we had is that this game lacks a two-player mode. But beside that, this is a strong game. We're looking forward to a third one.", "date": "Aug 23, 1997"}
