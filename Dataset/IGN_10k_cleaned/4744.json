So, what's different this time around? Well, this year's version is an evolutionary step from last year, but some of the features, like the new crease and wider space behind the goal (new rules from the NHL), are welcome additions that put a twist on the familiar NHL gameplay. The excellent play-by-play from Jim Hughson and Daryl Reaugh has been enhanced for more specific calls to the action. There's also new player and goalie motion-capturing for new animations (players will jump over a zooming puck, for example). And if you need to hone your hockey skills, you can head over to drill practice to learn how to set up plays properly.  Easily the biggest enhancement  a powerbar will appear at the bottom of the player when holding down the shot button, displaying the intensity of a slapshot. Star players can also perform special moves when skating into the zone with the puck, indicated by a ~star~ icon on the player cursor. This is also the first NHL-series game that features full Dual Shock support, which gives the game analog control as well as vibrations during awesome checks.  All the little features that were in last year's version, like trades, full-player statistics, season, playoff, and final options, are here in NHL 99. Let's start this off on a sour note. I can't believe EA Sports let this game out with a lower framerate than last year's version. The developers have claimed that they increased the game's resolution  in my opinion, the look of NHL 98 was fine and shouldn't have been touched. Hockey, by nature, is a fast-as-hell sport, and it can only benefit from a smooth framerate. Granted, once you get into the game, you're more paying attention to the gameplay than counting each individual frames of animation, but still...last year's version was obviously smoother.That said, there's a lot of little tweaks embedded into the game, and yes, it plays better than last year. Better AI (the players set up plays and follow defense a lot better), more moves (the star-move is a great addition that works well  it actually reminds you that you can perform a spin), and just a better overall presentation. (refs will call upstairs for a review of a crease violation...and it can be (and sometimes is) overturned after further review. Nifty). Bottom line, the game plays very tighter than last year's version, even though it has a similar feel.If you own last year's version, you still have yourself a fine piece of hockey gameplay...but obviously if you're a hockey nut you'd want the new rules and enhanced control. The analog support is a good addition, but naturally, after almost a decade of using a D-pad for the NHL series, it's very difficult to convert.I just wish the game was a little smoother. That would have been the icing on a very tasty cake.", "date": "Sep 30, 1998"}
