This is a genre which has hardly evolved a whit since it first sprang into being with the original Super Mario Kart -- yes, the introduction of polygons has made a bit of a difference, but not necessarily in any way that matters.  If the purpose of evolutions in gameplay is to make a game more fun, then most of the changes to the kart racing genre have failed in that main aim, since you'd be hard pressed to find a serious gamer who'd consider Mario Kart 64 or [insert Traveller's Tales game of your choice here] all that much more fun than the original Mario Kart.  So kart games in the modern age are not a whole lot more fun than they were on the SNES.  However, they are still fun.  Herein lies our quandary, because while our critical impulses say ~This game is derivative, lacking originality,~ our little happy lizard brains say ~Whee!  Kart racing!  Fun!~  Eh, the hell with it.  Whee!  Star Wars kart racing!  Fun!  Gameplay  'Cause that's what this is, Star Wars: Episode 1 kart racing.  Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away, somebody carpet-bombed George Lucas' creations with a brutal overdose of the cuteness dust, turning everything bouncy and happy and big-headed.  This is actually not as bad as it sounds.  In fact, it's not bad at all.  If you ever wondered whether it would be possible to create a milieu where Jar-Jar Binks could be not only tolerable, but downright entertaining, it's right here.  It is also not fair to lump Super Bombad Racing in with the many completely derivative kart racers of the previous generation, because this game does more with the advantages of a 3D environment than anything else in the genre.  The only close competitor is Diddy Kong Racing, and it isn't all that close.  The level designers working on Bombad have taken plenty of cues from SSX (or whatever well EA Canada also drew from), giving their tracks a great sense of scale, especially when you get into the later levels.  Early on, they're standard kart loops, but by the time you reach the second tier of races, there are some very impressive designs.  The Otoh Gunga race takes place mainly underwater, where you can move in all three dimensions through huge submerged tunnels, and the final Droid Control Ship level has some great zero-gravity sequences.   Throughout, the courses are filled with shortcuts, forks, and broad areas where you can maneuver and grab a length or two on your opponents.  You won't go through a track the same time twice (at least not until you've gotten it thoroughly dialed), and even when you settle on a solid winning route, you probably still haven't found all the different hidden paths and corners you can cut.  The variety of shortcuts, aside from adding plenty of replay value, also helps balance the game in multiplayer races.  Mario Kart 64 was a mad dash for the few dominating shortcuts -- Super Bombad's shortcuts are balanced by all the other shortcuts, and by the greater difficulty of finding them.  Super Bombad's control scheme is not exactly more difficult to master than others, but it does take some getting used to.  The closest equivalent would perhaps be the flight races in Diddy Kong, but Bombad moves much faster, with a looser feeling to the control as a consequence.  All the vehicles can hop and hover, so they tend to corner very wide, especially at high speed.  The trick is learning how to use the jump and turbo boost controls, which let you turn much more tightly and take advantage of shortcuts and wide points.  The weapons also help -- Super Bombad features a nicely varied arsenal of mines, traps, guns, homing missiles, power-drain widgets, seeker drones, and character-specific special weapons for every racer.  Weapons play far more of a role in arena mode than they do in the race mode, though.  If you're fast, you can finish the racing championship without firing a shot.  Some would ask ~what fun would that be?~ and it's a reasonable question.  The arena mode provides plenty of opportunities for violent catharsis, though, allowing all eight racers to shoot it out in stages with the same scope as the racetracks.  That scope is the main failing of the battle game, though -- there's too much space.  The power-ups tend to be a little too thinly spread, and the amount of empty space is such that it's very easy to turtle.  You can hide off in a corner and wait for the rest of the battlers to settle it among themselves, which isn't so much fun when you've got someone in a multiplayer game without the guts to mix it up.  The arena levels do have some fun specific design elements, though, lots of hidden power-ups you can hop to and cool movie-inspired special hazards.  The Great Pit of Carkoon level, as you'd expect, comes complete with a Sarlacc pit to suck down your racers and digest them for however many centuries.  Graphics  It looks cute, yes, but more than that, some effort and technical sophistication has been put into making this game look cute.  The little SD character models are remarkably detailed, and each one has a bunch of little animations to give them personality.  As I said before, in this particular context, Jar-Jar sticking his tongue out and making weird burbling noises is actually entertaining, as opposed to nauseating.  The weakest characters are actually Anakin and Obi-Wan, because they aren't quite bizarre enough.  Jar-Jar's antics are fun, Darth Maul waving his fists and gibbering about the power of the Sith is a hoot, Sebulba looks great in his giant goggles -- heck, I can even stand Boss Nass, and I was ready to rush the projection booth during his scenes in the movie proper.  The cute little characters are dwarfed by the scale of the environments, especially in the Power Generator and Droid Control Ship levels -- they are big, with good texturing most of the way and all sorts of fun animating background elements.  Theed City has Trade Federation tanks taking potshots at you, while Jawas zap you with shrinker rays on the Tatooine desert track.  Zip through the open-space section of the Control Ship and you can see the Federation battle fleet arrayed out in orbit.  The lighting effects are solid, if not remarkable, and the weapons all have their particular explosions and particle-zaps.  The downside is that the engine isn't quite strong or stable enough for the challenges thrown at it.  The framerate isn't a particularly bothersome issue in the single-player game -- it wobbles an awful lot, but never in a way that disturbs gameplay so badly -- but it gets bad enough in the split-screen mode that I wish some more tuning had gone into perfecting the multiplayer graphics.  The big, expansive third-tier levels aren't as fun as they should be.  The level architecture also tends to glitch a fair bit in some levels (the Mos Espa and Tatooine tracks in particular).  It's possible to drive and fall through solid objects here and there, and some levels are organized such that the camera will get briefly stuck behind corners, cliffs, tunnel roofs and awnings.  This, again, is more annoyance than genuine obstacle, but with as many testers as are credited working on the project, I'm surprised that issues like this remain.  Sound  You haven't lived until you've heard the kiddie samba remix of the John Williams Star Wars theme.  Seriously.  Like so many aspects of Super Bombad's presentation, I wonder why I don't hate the music.  I certainly hated the porno-funk cantina remixes in Star Wars: Demolition, and the Bombad tunes should reside on a comparable level of iniquity.  But I like them.  I suppose there's something about the generally ridiculous atmosphere that leaves one receptive to just about any element of it -- if I'm going to laugh at the SD Jar-Jar throwing his tongue everywhere, I may as well laugh at the marimba and pan-pipes version of the Sith Lord intro music...  And while I'm at it, I'll laugh at the voice samples, most of which are drawn straight from the movies (Jake Lloyd gets a credit in the voice-acting section).  In for a penny, in for a pound, I suppose. Like I say, the whole game is like that.  For some reason, the silliness is infectious.  The reason the personality that suffuses Super Bombad didn't work in the movie is because it ran so painfully contrary to the serious elements.  Jar-Jar wasn't conceived or implemented with the restraint required for proper comic relief -- watch the old Star Wars movies, the comparatively good ones, and you'll see that what laughs they have are mainly wry asides.  There are no walking punchlines like the infamous Gungan, because they wouldn't have worked.But we were talking about a videogame, weren't we?  If you, like me, can accept the goofy personality and minor technical difficulties of Super Bombad Racing, it's an excellent kart racer, and one that does a decent job of moving the genre forward (which was the last thing we expected from Lucas Learning, of all companies).  The track design and variety is excellent, and while the single-player championship is over relatively quickly, the nine race tracks provide plenty of multiplayer replay value.  And if you still can't stand Jar-Jar, even in a game designed to suit him, you can always have fun dropping him in the Sarlacc a couple of hundred times.", "date": "Apr 23, 2001"}
