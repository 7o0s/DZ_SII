With Knights of the Old Republic, Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II and Neverwinter Nights under their belts -- as well as more than a few plates of poutine...or so we hear -- the folks at Bioware are known best for their finely-crafted RPGs (although let's not forget the equally finely-crafted MDK2).   Now Bioware has branched out into expansion pack development. Although the second expansion pack to Neverwinter Nights, Hordes of the Underdark is the first fully internal Bioware developed expansion for their popular D&D-based RPG (the first expansion, Shadows of Undrentide, was co-developed with FloodGate Entertainment). I was personally a little disappointed with the first expansion, so I was wondering if Hordes of the Underdark could live up to the impact of Neverwinter Nights. Sure, Shadows of Undrentide was good, but it just wasn't as polished and epic as the original, and it didn't really add much to the game. Luckily, Hordes of the Underdark doesn't suffer from the same problems, and reconfirms that Bioware is the premier Dungeons and Dragons videogame developer.  As I said before, Shadows of Undrentide just didn't have an ~epic~ feel, but that's something Hordes of the Underdark has in droves. This is an epic adventure for character level 15 and higher, so you can expect huge battles and plenty of heroic quests to fulfill. When you start the game, you can either pull in a character from a previous adventure, use a pre-made character or create a new one that will automatically be raised to level 15. Since you start at such a high level, you'll already have a variety of options, skills, feats and, where appropriate, spells that you can use in the game. Making the game even more epic is the fact that Bioware has raised the level cap to 40, although you'll probably end Hordes of the Underdark somewhere in the range of level 25 to 30.    There's the usual assortment of D&D character classes to choose from as well as the prestige classes added in Shadows of Undrentide. In addition, Bioware has added six new prestige classes: Champion of Torm, Dwarven Defender, Pale Master, Red Dragon Disciple, Shifter and Weapon Master. These classes tend to favor fighter and spell-caster types, and round out the prestige class offerings from Undrentide quite nicely, allowing for something special for nearly every base class.   Bioware didn't stop with a few new classes in the expansion. Hordes offers a lot more than your average expansion pack, like a slew of new character heads, portraits, spells, monsters, feats and skills. One of the most notable new skills is crafting, both for armor and weapons, and using materials such as mithril, iron, dyes and wood to create new items or to change the appearance of existing items. This means you can customize your look much more in Hordes of the Underdark, even after creating your character.  One of the most welcome new additions is the ability to hire two henchmen. Dungeons and Dragons has always been about party adventuring, and while you could do that in the multiplayer side of Neverwinter Nights, the single-player side limited to you to just one extra henchman to party with. Sometimes you'll even adventure with three henchmen, although these aren't really hired henchmen so much as they are members that will join your party for special parts of the game. These added party members give more of a true D&D feel, and I've had seven members in my party at once with henchmen, familiars and summoned creatures.      You can travel with some of the characters from the previous Neverwinter Nights adventures, including the kobold Bard Deakin, Halfling thief Tomi and heavy-handed Half-Orc Daelan Red-Tiger. There's also a whole new host of interesting characters you'll get to adventure with, including a demon and an angel...talk about your spiritual journeys.  However, I do have one complaint about the henchmen: they don't seem very smart. Just as in Neverwinter Nights and Shadows of Undrentide, dealing with your party-mates can be a little frustrating. They still stand in the middle of area spell effects and walk into traps that you've already detected, and they're slow to react in some situations, like when you're getting pounded and asking them to ~guard me.~ They also get hung on walls occasionally, and you have to back track to go get them. It's not a huge problem as it doesn't happen constantly, but it happens often enough to notice.  Plot is always an important part of any RPG, and this is one of the strongest aspects of Hordes of the Underdark. The story in the game is deep and engaging, with plenty of twists and surprises to keep you guessing as to who is telling the truth and what is really going on. While I did find the story to be a bit lacking in the first chapter, it really picks up quickly in chapter two, and the game sucks you in even more the longer you play.   Bioware uses in-game cutscenes to great effect to tell much of the story this time around, which really lends to the dramatic feel of the expansion pack since it keeps you in the game world. While the story is a bit confusing and slower-paced in chapter one, the game really gets revving and becomes much more interesting by chapter two, and chapter three is a whirlwind of back-stabbing, double-takes and larger-than-life schemes complete with multiple endings. As fulfilling as the story is, one thing I did notice is that there aren't as many alignment changing events and choices as there were in the original Neverwinter Nights or the first expansion, but there are plenty of chances to role-play your character's alignment correctly, and the branching dialogue choices allow you to be the goodie-two-shoes type, the apathetic type or the truly evil type.  Because it uses a tile system, dungeon design has always been a little repetitive in Neverwinter Nights, but the expansion does add a few new tilesets and the dungeons tend to look different than the ones from the original. Since the plot revolves around the Drow, most of the game takes place underground. The dungeons tend to focus on one race or type of creature, like Beholders or Golems or Undead, so there's not a lot of creature variety in the individual levels, but there is in the overall game, and you never really feel like you're just having the same encounter over and over again and you play through the game.    In addition to new creatures like Mind Flayers and Gelatinous Cube, many of the dungeons are filled with some really clever puzzles, ranging from word puzzles to math puzzles to logic puzzles and even a few color-based puzzles thrown in for good measure. This breaks up the monotony of just hack, hack, hack, slash, slash, slash, and tests your brain a bit as some of the puzzles are actually pretty tricky to figure out.  Almost two years old, the Aurora Engine Hordes of the Underdark has been given a slight graphical upgrade, and the visuals tend to be better than the previous versions with higher-polygon character and object models. They look nice, but the models are still a bit blocky and angular. However, these graphical upgrades do come with a performance hit, and the required system specs are now to the level of the original's recommended specs. The game does chug on slower systems at high details, but everything is scalable, so you should be able to find a happy medium, even on the lowest requirements  There's a new way to look at the game, as the team added a new over-the-shoulder cam that gets you right in the action. Full skies are also a new addition to the outdoor areas, but you'll see them rarely in this expansion since it takes place mostly underground. However, modders will be able to use the skyboxes in their modules.      In addition to the new graphical touches, there's a whole new soundtrack from Jeremy Soule, the composer for the original Neverwinter Nights. The music fits the game perfectly, and adds to the dramatic feel of the epic adventure. Although not all of the extensive dialogue is accompanied by voice, the voice acting is also high-quality, and the actors embody their characters well, and give the game a lot of personality.  As far as play time goes, you can expect somewhere between 20 to 30 hours, depending on how many side quests you complete. Although you can play the module in multiplay mode, with the deep story and unique items, it's really designed as a single-player experience. If you're looking to lengthen the game time a bit, I suggest playing through with a different character class, especially since there are so many potential paths with so many regular and prestige classes available.   Unlike Shadows of Undrentide, Hordes of the Underdark is much harder, and offers more of a challenge for experienced players. Since the game is for character levels 15 and above, you'll be fighting the likes of dragons, demons, powerful mages, undead overlords and other vicious uber-creatures who can kill you with just one touch. The boss fights are particularly nasty, and I found myself loading my last saved game during more than one big battle trying to figure out the best way to go about winning. You can cheat a bit on some of the boss fights and by leaving the room, resting up and rememorizing your spells. When you get back, your opponent will still be at the same health level they were when you left.   Bioware really managed to stuff a lot of extras into this expansion pack, and it plays and flows much better than Shadows of Undrentide. The story is great, the epic battles are truly epic and the graphics have been given a slight tweak. There are a few minor blemishes, but for the most part Hordes of the Underdark is a shiny gem. Even with all the free user-created content out there for Neverwinter Nights, Hordes of the Underdark is well worth plunking down $30 for if you like what you played in the original.", "date": "Dec 4, 2003"}
