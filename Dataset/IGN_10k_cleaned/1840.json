With that one title, Dreamcatcher suddenly moved up a little bit in our eyes. Here was an adventure game that, while it had its faults, was a real standout in the genre. ~Maybe things are changing,~ we thought. Then the company decided to release the pooey Oddysey: Search for Ulysses. ~Aha,~ we thought, ~It was just a fluke.~ I remember actually saying to Vinnee, ~Hey, Vinnee! Come over here -- turns out it was a fluke.~ ~What was?~ replied Vinnee. ~The quality of Dracula -- it was a fluke.~ Vinnee just said ~oh~ and turned around to see if there was anyone else he might rather talk to.  But it turns out that Oddysee was the fluke between the two games that we really like...or maybe the first was a fluke and this second one is an entirely different fluke. Like those two twins separated at birth that both won the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes and used to money to have in vitro fertilization therapy and then both named their kids Stan but it turns out that they weren't really sisters after all, they just looked alike and happened to have the same birthday. Anyway, that's not the point of the story. The point is, that a new Dracula game, The Last Sanctuary, is every bit as good as the previous one. The previous Dracula game, that is, not the previous sucky game.  Boy, this reviewing stuff is harder than it looks.  Anyway, the game is a lot of fun provided that you enjoy adventure games where you kill vampires with puzzles in between bouts of scouring every surface in the game looking for things to pick up to combine with other things so you can be ready to solve another puzzle when the next vampire shows up. Okay, that's a joke (at least, it's supposed to be). Truth be told, I actually do like those kinds of games. It's a nice change of pace from the excitement of playing shooters and sims and strategy games all day.  Basically, this is a pretty straightforward Dracula type story. Your chaste and platonic love, Mina, might have been turned into a vampire. You enlist the aid of Dr. Seward to help you in your efforts to defeat Dracula and rehumanify your sweetie. Dracula sends a whole gang of undead vampires and twisted humans, including the Renfiedly Hopkins, to get in your way. Eventually you out puzzle these evil doers and journey to Dracula's home to...well. I don't want to spoil it.  Those of you who have played the previous game will notice lots of similarities here. But there are some significant differences (okay, not significant exactly, but different nevertheless). First and foremost, the game looks amazing. Each environment is detailed and sharp and, as is to be expected with a game like this, too dark to appreciate. Whatever. You can simply move your mouse around to look around the environments. Just using flat backgrounds, the game renders the illusion of  a full 3D environment better than any game I've seen yet. Even better, the game looked (and ran) just as well on a simple 333MHz with a Voodoo 2 as it did on a 600MHz with a Voodoo 5.  The environments that you explore range from an upscale theater to a dank sewer. You'll also visit a modest English home, an asylum, a couple of cemeteries and a gigantic castle. Not bad, right. But you just know I'm getting ready to say something negative, right? Of course I am. But luckily, it's nothing major. I normally wouldn't even mention it except that people expect me to be critical. Otherwise they might think I'm on the take. One real problem is that there's very little life in the backgrounds. They're detailed enough alright, but there's almost no movement in any of them during most of the game. And when a creature makes its way onto the screen in all its sprite-based glory, you're kind of thrown by the difference in quality.  The game also suffers from a lack of transitions from point A to point B. This really irks me -- especially considering that it takes a handful of steps to get across most medium sized areas. And wait until you're all the way in the back of the basement of the asylum and suddenly hear the phone ringing upstairs in the office. Running through each of the screens is bad enough, but without transitions it seems like even more of a slide show.  But the actual cinematic transitions for the various plot points in the game are numerous and striking. Apart from using first-rate models, the CGI work captures the emotions and attitudes of the characters very well. Mouth movements aren't fantastic, but these characters are much more animated than we've come to expect. The content of the scenes is also good and keeps the action level high.  Which is good because there's not really any action outside of the cutscenes. It's all walking and solving, walking and solving. Even the timed action sequences where you have to fight off a vampire attacker can only be solved through the art of puzzlery. The only real challenge is in finding the items you need and then combining them together and using them at the appropriate moments.  Sadly, this becomes one of those trial and error deals but for those of you who are smarter than I am, it shouldn't present too much of a problem. I will say that combining the sugar cube with the matchbox to catch the fly to feed to the inmate so he'll give you the vampire detection goggles still doesn't make much sense to me. And the less said about the vampire serum chemistry set puzzle, the better.  This game retains pretty much the same interface as the previous title. As your mouse cursor passes over something you can interact with, it changes form. A little magnifying glass appears if you can inspect something. A hand appears for things you can grab and some little cogs appear over items that can be used. Like most games of its kind, Dracula asks you to combine all the various items you pick up in the most unusual combinations. The combinations aren't always immediately apparent but with enough patience, even Dan could figure them out.  But really, that's not too much of a criticism, is it? I mean, I'd be complaining like hell if the game was too hard, right? I don't mean to imply that the game is stupid in approach or execution. Although some of the situations are kind of a stretch, the story is well done and interesting in its own right. Hell, even the parts that threaten your suspension of disbelief are kind of cool. It's still to early to tell if this is going to be the new pattern with Dreamcatcher but, as long as they keep making them this good, adventure fans will have something to look forward to.  -- Steve Butts  Want to share your opinions with the world?
