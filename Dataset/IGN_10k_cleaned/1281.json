There, I've said the game's title in its entirety. From now on, we'll just call it LSA or by the end of this review, I won't have any fingers left. What can be said for this, the latest in the almost bi-monthly legacy that is Army Men? Sure, the title is longer (MUCH longer), but has anything really changed? Nope. LSA is essentially the same as the first. Granted, there have been some gameplay additions, but let's face it: this IS your daddy's Army Men.   LSA has been kissed with the 3DO seal of quality, which means all those oldies but goodies are in full effect. Clipping, crap texture goodness, shoddy control, and low framerates don't just make appearances, but are stars of the show, once again drowning out what could have been a decent game. I swear to God, if this is what passes for a bankable game, I don't know if this industry can stand many more of these titles. It seems like every few months a new Army Men game is spurted out of the 3DO development house and bounces into little Timmy's hands where he eagerly spits out 50 bucks to defile his PlayStation.   Now don't get me wrong, I know these guys work hard for their money, and every once in a while, a novel  even genuinely good  effort comes out of it (can you say Army Men: Air Attack?), but if everyone pussy-foots around this issue than nothing is going to change. Consumers will keep buying into the cleverly crafted PR brainwashing scheme of convincing everyone that they played with little plastic army men when they were a kid, and that this game is living out fantasies for the little boy inside us all, and 3DO will keep on kicking out these games. I'm not in the habit of launching in to a self-righteous bout whenever I start a review, but all this needed to be said. Now on to the game.   Gameplay For the uninitiated, here's the scoop: the armies of green (the good guys), and tan (the baddies) are forever clashed in the unending struggle of war. Ready for the clever part? This epic battle takes place in our world, but it's all so small that we don't notice! Yeah, that's it. OK, so you're in the know now. This is the backbone the pervades all of the games, and while it does set up a rather interesting screen with which this mini-drama is shone on, it seems like it's never fully realized. This may be something that's remedied by the PlayStation 2 continuations of the franchise, but here it just doesn't seem doable.   It's hard to figure out where to start. When reviewing a game, it's important to nitpick, but here, I expended no effort to point out any problems. First, there's the control. While your green in-game counterpart runs along at quite the brisk pace, the turning is ludicrously slow. Now I'm no physics major, nor am I a doctor, but since we are dealing with semi-true-to-life physics here, this is a problem. Give this little test a try. Stand up. Now, as fast as you can, spin 180 degrees. Now, return to your original position and begin running as fast as you can in that direction for a few paces until you've hit your top speed. Took a little longer, didn't it? Well, not for our little Army Men! If someone were to approach you from your side, you'd at least be able to turn quickly to meet him before the guy got off more than 1 or 2 shots. In LSA, it's more like 5 or 6 shots. And 5 or 6 shots can mean death. Oh, there's a saving grace. You see, if you want to spin too fast, you can hold down the O button and you'll turn at a speed that can only spell over-correction. ~But Sam,~ you say, ~surely you can backpedal as fast as you can run forward?~ No, no, my friends, you creep backwards with the same cheetah-quick speed that you turn. Fun.   Now that's not to say the controls themselves weren't decently thought out. The brain-dead decision to make turning and reversing as slow as being neck-high in water or hopped up on speed COULD have been remedied (at least to a degree) by adding a strafe button, but alas, that could make the game fun, and there's none of that here. If, through some miracle, you're able to get past the controls themselves, you'll find that the control scheme is rather intuitive and puts the many actions of your players within a reasonable stretch of finger movements.   The player is guided by the dpad or analog sticks (although they offer only digital feedback, and both sticks do the same task as the d-pad), X fires the gun, and Triangle and Square cycle through your weapons. R1 brings up a reticule for more precise aiming and holding L1 will drop your player in to a ducked position. L2 and a direction will roll you in the direction, and R2 can be used to drop to a knee or go prone (lay down).   The meat of LSA's gaming experience is in the somewhat free-roaming third-person experience. You run around, blasting tan troops with your unlimited ammo-equipped assault rifle. There are some sequences where you take control of a gun mounted on a vehicle of some type (Jeep, raft, anti-aircraft emplacement, tank, etc.), but for the most part it's run, shoot, run, shoot, get shot, start over, run, shoot...  Graphics Dear, sweet, Lord, where do I start? There are so many ghastly, evil things at work here, it's hard to find a beginning. First off, there's the framerate. Yes, I've been tainted by the 60fps goodness that is the PS2, but my eyes will never forget the halcyon days of PC gaming where I tried to run Quake 3 on my Pentium 200. It's was a veritable chunk-fest, with framerates in the teens, and at best mid-'20s. This is the experience I was treated to with LSA. Combine that with moments where the palettes of most of the textures in any given scene blended together so horribly that it was actually difficult to tell a friggin' BOX from an enemy troop, and you have a stunningly horrible feast for the eyes. Textures with transparencies around the edges are defined with thick black borders, so the edges of trees become more like cookie-cutter standouts rather than a piney growth that sprung from the earth. There are some differences in textures, especially from campaign to campaign, but they do tend to blend together far too much, especially when viewing a rather complex scene from far away, where it can be impossible to tell anything apart.  Then there's the magnificent clipping. On ANY level, there are occasions where downed enemy soldiers will fall through the object they were using to shield themselves, or even the ground. This doesn't happen once in a while, but CONSTANTLY. This is, of course, if the slain commandoes actually make it to the ground. On just as many occasions, I found a fallen troop (friend OR foe) was stuck in mid-animation as he fell to his knees and keeled over. The result is a trooper that looks alive, even if he's been long killed, a dead man frozen in time moments before he could actually show the effects of gravity. Bravo, 3DO. Let's hope you can keep pumping out something this vile every couple of months. If I'm even in the need for a good puke, I'll just pop in a copy of one of these games.  The ~animations~ are usually a group of about 5 or 6 frames dedicated to running. Death animations are a near-instant swap from the standing position to the same frame placed horizontally on the ground or, if you're lucky, one of the victims laid out in the classic ~chalk outline~ stance. When turning, the feet don't move, the whole character just rotates around a center axis. There are odd occurrences of a smooth animation, such as toss of a grenade or the careful backward steps, but those are animations that you don't see for 75% of the game.    Sound Amazingly, sound is the game's strong suit. The effects are strikingly clear, from the rat-tat-tats of the assault rifles, to the deep booms of grenades, Howitzers and mortors. Heck, the flame-thrower sounds cool, and all the weapons sound different, even the different guns.  Most of the music is a mish-mash of classic army-type snare and bass drums and low chords. Like the effects, the sound is crisp and clean, but has the unfortunate habit of kicking for no good reason about 30 seconds after the level has started, only to drop out of existence about a minute later. This would be fine if there was radio chatter all the time, but there's almost always nothing beyond the sound of gunfire and the occasional vehicle.    opinion If you're thinking of picking the game up, STOP. I HAD to play this game to review it, but that's nearly 10 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Unless you're some psycho collector that has to have every PlayStation game, or an insane Army Men fan (there has to be one out there), steer clear of this like it was coated in the acidic Alien blood.  Presentation 5.0 While the menus and general feel aren't horrible, the game itself overshadows a slightly more polished presentation.   Graphics 3.0 Even by 3DO's standards, this game chokes. Horrible clipping, lousy animation, and bland, grainy textures all amount to a nice low score.  Sound 8.0 There are hints of music, but it's not enough. Fortunately, the sound is surprisingly good.  Gameplay 4.0 I think I summed it up earlier: run, shoot, run, shoot, get killed, get pissed, start over, run, shoot. Wrap it all up in a screwed up control scheme and it spells fun!  Lasting appeal 1.0 If someone can find some initial appeal, I'll be impressed. There's only so many pixelly tan solders you can kill before it all begins to suck. I think that number is 4.  Overall score 3.0", "date": "Sep 27, 2000"}
