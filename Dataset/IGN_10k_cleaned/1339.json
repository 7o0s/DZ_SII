Or, uh, there's a second if you're referring to Hard Truck 2, even though most gamers probably missed out on ValuSoft's original, budget-priced Russian import.  Although the common man wouldn't be inclined to think it, the Soviets purportedly know a little something about the trials and travails of a life spent on the road.  They also seem to have an eye for picking up on what the big ~Mart~ (Wal, K, and Stein) shoppers crave.  Additionally, while it's a surprise to discover that this game expertly caters to a small, blue-collar crowd when taken at face value, it's still more shocking to realize that this sucker might just have some widespread appeal.  For starters, two types of driving models are offered: arcade and simulation.  Logically, the former option's more forgiving in terms of turns and crashes, while the latter choice should strike the fancy of career big riggers.  The gameplay itself, which plays like a toned down version of Crazy Taxi, is built around the principle of moving cargo from point A to point B in the fastest amount of time.  Crashes damage goods, reducing their value, and slow deliveries also knock dollars off of your reward for a job well done.  A broad, interlocking system of highways connects destinations, which must be traveled back and forth ad infinitum, because play is a strictly open-ended affair.    As the course of events unfolds, you'll either make money and prosper, buying trucks for computer controlled employees to use (thereby adding to one's bank account), or languish in poverty, spending every last cent on repairs and rescues.  While there's little to be said for chugging from one place to another, trying to avoid oncoming traffic, trees, and road signs, occasionally a few zingers will spice up the action.  Without a cargo scanner, for example, you'll have trouble determining what's legal and what's not, so if a cop passes by, shows interest and a certain nimrod forgets to dump his/her cargo, they'll be headed upstate faster than you can say twenty-five to life.  Usually, though, you'll just chug along, watching the miles roll by, idly deciding whether to gun it off road, compete in a circuit race, make a pit stop for gas, stick to the beaten path, or ram headfirst into a helpless sedan.  Thanks to automap and pager messaging features, getting around is a walk in the park. The loose control scheme takes a bit of wrangling to get used to, but once truckers have it down pat, there's no going back.  During those rare moments when a vehicle gets stuck or breaks down, a nifty 911 feature puts one's sorry butt back on the road, minus a few thousand clams for the trouble.  On the whole, the title's so gosh darned ergonomically sound that if you know someone who can't figure the interface out, buy an ~I'm with stupid~ shirt and hang out in public with them more often.  But not everything comes up roses in the current context.  Visual glitches sometimes cause a truck to fall off into sketchy textured oblivion until a call for help is placed.  The tutorial's a movie that briefly touches on points you're unlikely to recall five minutes later when the game begins.  Load times sucky sucky suck suck.  Backgrounds, although they vary slightly between locations, show signs of pixelation and graininess.  Vehicle and environmental models are simplistic, as are the sky textures.  Luckily rough edges were smoothed over with a fast frame rate, a pounding hard rock soundtrack, and some pleasant day, night and weather condition changes.  Ultimately, though the environment's hardly flawless, the main shortcoming is in regards to the repetitive nature of play.  But regardless of how much you like to keep on truckin', the experience loses its charm with a quickness.  When it comes down to the wire though, Hard Truck 2 passes most of the tests it's put to with above average marks.  As value priced titles go, you'll be getting much more for the money with this product than say, Sprint Car Racing, Swamp Buggy Racing, or any other $19.99 title with the word ~racing~ haphazardly tacked on to the end of its name.  People who call eighteen wheelers home aren't likely to confuse this with a realistic rendition of their livelihood, but trucker or no, it isn't half bad.  -- Scott Steinberg      Want to share your opinions with the world?
