This third game is filled with serendipity and deja vu, urging gamers to dive in, even though it seems they've done it all before.   Tomb Raider III is a more refined, more thorough play experience than it's ever been, and it appears that it's perhaps the biggest game of them all. While the first challenged us all to learn mad Lara skills with smart, moderately long levels, the second was a frustrating, intertwined set of only 10 levels, but 10 gigantic levels. TR III brings us not to new dimensions of gameplay, but to a new set of ever-so-different challenges in which stealth, a cadre of vehicles, and a level head hopefully will bring you to a new appreciation. ~Hopefully~ is the key word here. After all, while TR III brings new life to the table, it's still through and through the same gameplay experience.   Tomb Raider III sets Lara up on a multitude of quests in which she must obtain four crystals, each strangely related to one another through a series of ancient accidents and acquisitions, magic, and a big old meteor, the cause of it all.   You will start off in the India campaign and must pass through four levels to open up the new non-linear design. The next campaigns, the South Pacific, London, and the Nevada Desert can all be played in whichever order you choose. After these are completed, each with a final boss and several mini- and sub-bosses, you will go to Antarctica, and play through a handful more bosses, and solve the final puzzle.   Almost every level is interspersed with cut-scenes in which the perfectly formed Lara (she's actually gotten skinnier) finds herself being segued into a completely new area of the world. The cut-scenes occasionally tell stories, but they more often bring only new questions to the table. Still, they're rewarding in a strange way.  Areas of improvement and change are vast yet subtle. Lara is capable of new movements, a nice change that probably could've been implemented in the second installment. She can sprint for a limited amount of time, and now she can crawl through low, narrow crevices. The sprinting comes in handy when you're running from raptors, subway trains, tigers, the inevitable Indy-style boulders, the last boss, and T-Rexes, among others. She can also climb monkey-bar style, a nice new touch. And finally, she can crawl. Now, more than ever, you will look at Lara's ass as it's bent over in front of you. Is this a great thing for teenage boys, or simply more gratuitous sexism?   Either way (you know the answer already), Lara gets into the action via new vehicles and means of locomotion. She can now ride crazy-ass stuff, like a speedy, underwater, handheld mini-sub, a rockin' (but never flippin') ATV, and a kayak, among others.   Tomb Raider is now a 60-40 split between puzzles and action. Lara finds herself jumping like a God-damned kangaroo all across the planet, but she still must find the requisite switches, underwater levers, and keys. If anything, TR III is more like the first game than the second in its approach, built on exploring vast areas of polygonal landscapes in search of the right ledge or back-flipping stone, risking the leap to an area previously thought impossible. The level lengths are mixed, occasionally long, often medium in length, but never as long as those found in TR2 -- thankfully. They also increase in difficulty in each campaign; so the first is easy, the second and third more challenging.   The game's level design is clever in many cases, while still remaining frustrating to no end. Split paths are the biggest difference, and in my opinion, are great new additions. In many cases, Lara will go left instead of right at a crucial juncture, and then end up needing to take the right path after all. This change is exemplified best in the Temple Ruins and The River Ganges. But the game still leaves you hanging cold in areas that Shigeru Miyamoto would never let slip through. There are several occasions, like the Nevada Desert waterfall area, for instance, where you have to learn that saving beforehand is mandatory. That's just bad game design.   TR III has kept up with the times, too. Lara is completely analog controllable and she does the dual shock as good as any other English girl. The analog control may be too quick for many people, as Tomb Raider requires slow steady movement and precision jumps. This bodes well for those action lovers, because Lara is now better at moving around in sticky situations, but it's advisable to use analog with caution at first.   One of the biggest changes in the game is the look. While cynics cry that it's too little too late, TR III frees Lara to go where she couldn't have gone before. The use of triangular polygons and a modified (albeit same) TR engine enable Lara to scoot across gnarly tree roots and slants and slopes impossible for her to get across previously. What's more, Core simply went off with its new ability to execute realtime lighting. Flares were never so necessary as they are in Tomb Raider III, particularly in the London levels, where it seems Core felt obligated to make everything dark blue, deep purple, and black as night. Having said all that, major breakthroughs in technology and newer engines already have left TR III in the dust, and while Tomb Raider III looks better than the two others, it hasn't kept up with the times.   Lara also dons a broad new wardrobe, bringing a new light to the meaning of videogame pop-icon. Just like a super model, Lara constantly slips into sexy new outfits, including military fatigues and a tank-top, a leather cat-suit (admittedly delectable), her standard tight teal top and shorts, and an Antarctic outfit not entirely suited for the rough outdoors, if you catch my drift.   In the end, Tomb Raider III is a deeper, bigger, more varied game than before, and it's a better game for it. The game that Core will always be remembered for is better looking but still not nearly as good looking as many other games in the market. Nonetheless, Lara is more capable of immersing the player with more agile, athletic stunts, and her new garage of vehicles is a heck of a lot of fun. In short, Tomb Raider is better crafted than before, and there's more variation.   Tomb Raider III, however, isn't a black and white affair. It's not brilliant. Those folks who were tiring of the annual revision won't like this any better. In fact, they can easily claim that Tomb Raider is the same as ever. Tomb Raider III plays identically to its brethren, and it's packed with the same flaws, from stranding you in places from which there is no escape, to stupid Indiana Jones' style boulder tricks, to gargantuan expanses in which there is simply nothing to find or do. And while there is more action, it's just as clumsy, stilted, and jump-heavy as ever.   The sad thing is that Tomb Raider III solves none of its original dilemmas, and as it stands now, the exploration-adventure genre -- one that was revolutionized by Tomb Raider -- is in the exact spot it was two years ago.
