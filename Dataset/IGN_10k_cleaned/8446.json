You sail these skies in cars that fly. You sail these skies to chase that guy. Kubota, he, the madman who, kidnapped your girl and angered you. You soar and shoot, to find your love, while sailing through these skies above -- it's a game not great, but still quite fine. It's a game known as Namco's Ordyne.    There exists a sub-genre to shooters in gaming, one not regularly seen here in the States. It's a comedic, parodical take on the seriousness of most games in the genre, and it's known, among other names, as the cute-'em-up. Cute-'em-ups spin tradition upside down, and are often populated with gag characters, joke-ridden levels and lots and lots of overly vibrant, Candy Land colors. There are plenty of shoot-'em-ups out there, but Ordyne was on of the first that was cute.    Ordyne is a late '80s creation of Namco, a developer not known for its forced-scrolling shooter designs. The game, though, is a solid one. It offers a sugary-sweet presentation on the surface, with smiling, goofy anime characters and some not-so-serious enemy blueprint. But it's also notable in that it features an easier learning curve than most of its contemporaries, and some unique choices in certain aspects like power-up acquisition.    You're cast as Dr. Yuichiro Tomari, a brilliant and eccentric research scientist who somehow managed to get his fiance Kana taken away from him by the equally brilliant but unequally evil Dr. Kubota. A second player can join the quest to help out, taking command of the good doctor's loyal research assistant. They never had cool assignments like saving my professor's girlfriend from robots when I was in grad school. That co-op play is the key, though, as not a lot of the other shooters of the era offered two-player simultaneous modes.   Another cool aspect is Ordyne's signature upgrade system. You don't earn power-ups on the fly in this title. Rather, defeated enemies leave behind floating crystals. Money. The crystals are the cash of the sky, and you're tasked to collect as many as possible before the arrival of the Inn. The Inn, then, is a floating fortress of solitude that shows up in the middle of levels and offers a break from the action outside. You fly in and are greeted by a storefront, a friendly cashier and three possible power-ups to purchase. You can upgrade your ship's bombing capabilities, buy an extra life, or give your standard gun a more rapid rate of fire, among other options.   The rapid fire you'll find to be a true blessing, because Ordyne offers no default turbo option. This is old-school, thumb-mashing shooting action -- you've got a normal gun that will fire forward, and a bomber that drops ordnance on enemies below. Each one squeezes off shots way too slowly if you just hold down the buttons, so you'll find yourself hammering relentlessly on either or both of the triggers to get the shots to fly out faster. The rapid fire power-up item helps tremendously -- just take care not to get hit, as one touch from an enemy ship or flying round of unfriendly fire will send you crashing to the ground below.Ordyne's an odd one, that's for sure. But it's an odd one that's worth a look. It's not as ridiculously difficult as many other shooters, making it a good choice for starters inexperienced with the genre. It has some unique ideas in its gameplay design, and a two-player co-op mode, making it a strong shooter for already-dedicated fans of the genre. Its graphics are cute, but not amazing, and its control would be much nicer with some kind of standard turbo button, but those complaints don't defeat its earning a fair recommendation. Check it out if you want a break for the ordinary.", "date": "May 7, 2007"}
