It had a unique look and the combat was innovative as well. With both elements of stealth and brute force in fighting it created a balanced style of play for an engaging adventure. Three years later we have Rise of the Kasai which expands the story even further and adds a couple of new ideas for the game itself. Even though some of the changes are hit and miss the adventure is still one worth taking.   In The Mark of Kri the storyline was focused on Rau, a warrior, and his efforts to fight the forces of evil. A long, long time ago six individuals were marked with parts of a spell that, when combined, would bring a terrific evil back into the world. In the first game, Rau was able to fight back and save the day by killing off a necromancer, but the evil priests are nothing if not relentless and so Rise of the Kasai takes place 10 years later for another battle.    In this time period Rau's sister Tati has grown up and will fight right along with him. All of their levels have the option to choose one character or the other. Each character has a different path to take with many of the levels requiring the pair to split up for a while and fight together for the rest of it. What makes Rise of the Kasai both succeed and fail this time is just how well the pairing up works.   To make the pairing and the story even more interesting a few of the levels also take place 10 years before the events in The Mark of Kri. This storyline follows both Baumusu and Griz, two other marked warriors. Baumusu was Rau's mentor in the first game and in his adventures with Griz we get to see what he was like in his prime when he was fighting the Kasai himself. And with the timeline being broken up this lets the developers tell even more sides of the story.   The most impressive part of Kasai is the visual storytelling. All of the cutscenes are done with an incredibly elegant style that looks like all of the movies are happening on a living watercolor painting. It's a highly stylized way to get the story across and has many beautiful ideas. Every time one of these plays it's easy to get lost in what's happening on the screen.    But back to the gameplay itself, little has changed. In fact, nothing has changed with Rau at all. The combat system is just like before with the right analog stick assigning face buttons to nearby enemies. When the corresponding button is hit, Rau will go after that enemy. As for the combos, those are identical as well with a grand total of five different combos available for each of the weapons.    The use of Rau's spirit guide, Kuzo, works just like before as well. There are specific spots where Kuzo can perch. Rau can then send Kuzo ahead to scout out the situation by looking through the bird's eyes. It's a useful technique and makes it easier for Rau to use his stealth to take out the horn blowers, sentries who can call in support if they spot one of the warriors.   In the adventure the challenges of the game are all based around trying to avoid being spotted and using the tricks of the trade to get through as silently as possible. Many of the different situations play out as subtle puzzles in which the goal is to take out the horn blowers and get through as gracefully as possible. If that goes to hell, then it's time to just go through and slice everyone to pieces. The game is not complicated, but that's still what makes it fun. It's easy enough to get into, and get through, and the overall storyline makes the adventure worth it.     New to the series is the addition of some boss battles. These are cool for a change of pace, but they wear out their welcome a little bit when two of the bosses repeat in different levels with some minimal changes in strategy needed to defeat them. Fighting a dragon once is cool until you figure out the trick of taking him down. In the next dragon encounter it's just a matter of doing the same attack again without much effort. All of this still good for a change of pace, but they feel a little rushed for the game when there's some recycling going on.   With Tati and Baumusu and Griz now in the game they may have some different weapons and animations, but they still play out in the same fashion. The only difference is Tati who has some poisonous mushrooms that she can either throw onto an enemy or on the ground. Once the mushroom has landed it will start to put off a green gas and explodes into a deadly cloud whenever anyone gets close. This works out great for setting traps for sentries on their rounds or, even better, putting it on some fool's back so that when he walks near some other guards they all die.   So even though there are some surface changes, the general feel of the game is very similar to that of Kri. The standout element here is the co-operative parts of the game and it's definitely not what it could have been. It succeeds in a few areas, but can be downright frustrating as well. First, we should look at the good side of things.   The two main areas that the partnership works are when the characters are doing something entirely different and when they fight together. It's fun to clear out the guards on the ground while the other warrior is taking everyone else out on the elevated platforms. At its best there's the teamwork function of taking out guards that might see the other and vice versa.   Still, the world isn't perfect and several times when going through a level alongside the computer-controlled character the game hits many different hiccups. There are times when the other character will just stop in its tracks and refuse to move. On one mission I had to take care of everything as Griz because Baumusu refused to move after the first couple hundred feet. When I was about to enter into the final room of the stage I received a warning to not do it alone. I tried to run back and push him or attack him, but nothing happened and I finished it off myself.     With such a lazy partner it's good to see that the enemy A.I. doesn't fare much better. There are times that some of the soldiers will stand in pace during a big fight, but that's pretty understandable. At least the rest of the soldiers are attacking and enough is going on to keep the game interesting. The problem here is when the soldiers decide, for some unknown reason, to just stop moving. Soldiers will occasionally hit an invisible boundary and just stand there. It's possible to walk right up in front of them and they'll still be waiting until Rau or Tati get right next to them.    The biggest issue of all of these is when the partner will just run off at a crowd of soldiers, usually making things worse by being sighted by the horn blowers. I could be sneaking up with Rau, getting ready to do a critical hit with an arrow on the horn blower, but then Tati will run right at them and bring in another eight or so soldiers to fight. At other times I've seen Tati expertly take out three or four enemies with her mushrooms and then stand out in the open so that the last horn blower sees her and still calls in more soldiers.   With these issues in the game the overall effect of the co-operative play is that it brings in a few new experiences and creates a little bit more replay to see what the other character can do. It takes around eight to 10 hours to finish the game the first time through and the little bits that are truly unique would add an hour or two onto that. There are also some extra challenges, but most of these repeat themselves, requiring characters to do tons of combos or stealth kills. Getting these unlock arenas where there are challenges to fight lots of enemies at a time, but these are only for the most devoted fans.  After almost three years of development, the release of Rise of the Kasai is a little underwhelming. The elements that made The Mark of Kri are still here and as fun as before, but the new developments have brought with them new issues as well. Working with a partner can be fun, but all too often it's painfully obvious that this is a computer-controlled character and often an awkward one at that. There are also some boss battles, but even these repeat themselves for no good reason. Rise of the Kasai presents an engaging story and the gameplay is still fun to pull off, but with the new problems the experience is less than it could have been. There are still a fair amount of rough edges and it would have been better if more time had been put in to fine-tune the game.", "date": "Mar 25, 2005"}
