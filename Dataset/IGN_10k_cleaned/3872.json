{"name": "Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition", "name_review": "Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/08/28/mortal-kombat-tournament-edition", "text": "Last year, Midway stunned the Game Boy community by finally, after several attempts at the job, producing a quality Mortal Kombat game for the handheld. Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance was a real treat for GBA gamers looking for a good fight on their handheld systems. And it wasn't just a decent playing fighter, either. The team responsible went the extra mile by stuffing the GBA cart with a technically impressive 3D-style graphics engine, quality audio effects, and dozens of extras outside of the main game. The only thing it lacked was the full roster of characters that made it into the console games. But that was only due to the notoriously limited space of the cartridge medium.  Perhaps it was because the GBA version of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance was a success for Midway; but for whatever the reason, the company went back to the team responsible for the portable fighter and commissioned a sequel. The handheld group produced Mortal Kombat Tournament Edition, a revisit to the game design established on the handheld last year. But, unlike some GBA ~updates~ in the form of sequels, Tournament Edition isn't a cheap re-release of the Deadly Alliance design; the developers worked to make this game worthwhile for owners of last year's game. Fighters that didn't make the cut last year are in this year. There are new gameplay modes and secrets to unlock. And there are huge incentives in multiplayer gaming. It's not quite a flawless victory, but for a system with a serious lack of quality fighters, Tournament Edition fits the bill nicely. Features 15 characters Arcade, survival, and tag team modes for single player Arcade, tag team, tournament, and Race to Raiden modes for multiple players Link cable support for four players (multiple cartridges) Cartridge save (two slots) Only for Game Boy Advance  It's no secret that the developers used the Game Boy Advance version of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance for its foundation for Tournament Edition; it's, for good or bad, standard practice to ~recycle~ GBA technologies in order to make development more cost effective and worthwhile for the publisher. It's been done many times before; heck, even Nintendo's own games, like Golden Sun: The Lost Age and Advance Wars 2 reuse the existing engine and art assets to compile a brand new game.  Because it's core is the original game, you'll find identical gameplay in Tournament Edition; special moves, combo attacks, and fatalities are the norm in this 3D-style fighter, and the better you perform in the fight, the more ~koins~ you'll earn to unlock extras in the Krypt. Like last year's game, these koins can also be wagered against other players, which is something that's certainly encouraged considering the high price of some of the really good secrets hidden in this game. Test Your Might and Test Your Sight mini-games also make a return to add a little variety between battles, and offer another way of earning these coveted Koins.  But Tournament Edition actually adds a lot of new and exciting elements into the existing development; the team axed nearly the entire roster of characters from the old game to make room for a whole new line-up of fighters. Making their GBA debut from Deadly Alliance in Tournament Edition are Bo Rai Cho, Johnny Kage, Raiden, Sareena, Nitara, Cyrax, Mavado, Reptile,  Hsu Hao, Drahmin...as well as a couple hidden characters that are ~palette swapped~ from existing fighters, a tradition that goes back to the original arcade Mortal Kombat. The development team also move forward with updated statistics tracking that records more data to cartridge, something that's actually quite cool and handy for folks interested in seeing their progress in the single player modes. There are also a couple of brand new, fun gaming modes in Tournament Edition, including an update to the cool Endurance Mode from the classic Mortal Kombat design called Tag Mode, as well as a Survival Mode for players to see how many fighters they can slaughter with one power bar.  But the main focus seems to be in fully updating the game's previously existing multiplayer feature. The original Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance contained link cable support so that two players could go up against each other; it's a standard feature, and we would have definitely cried foul if it wasn't in the GBA game. But for Tournament Edition, the team upped the ante with this link cable support by offering options that utilize the fullest extent of the GBA's networking capability. The game design is still a one-on-one fighter, but these new elements let up to four players fight against each other; Tag Team mode pairs two or four players together in the same fight, jumping in and out of battle as their power bar diminishes (or to continue a combo). Tournament Mode puts players in a tournament tree and battle through to see who the top competitor is. Race to Raiden is a unique mode against two players, where each player compete through a line-up of fighters; if a player wins, he gets to advance to the next character...the one who wins with Raiden takes it all. There's even an ~arcade mode~ for four players that sort of simulates waiting around at an arcade; the loser of a one-on-one match gets off the ~machine~ and goes back in line, waiting for the next person to lose.  While the focus on multiplayer support is definitely limiting the audience, the developer includes hidden extras that can only be unlocked if they take advantage of the link cable support. And for owners of the original Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, players can even link up to that game with Tournament Edition; the only limitation is that only Scorpion, Quan Chi, and Shang Tsung (with Scorpion and Quan Chi morphs) are selectable since those are the three characters both games actually share. Tournament Edition even offers an extra incentive to do this Original/Sequel link: it unlocks a secret character in Tournament Edition. No game has really poured so much attention to the link cable support as much as Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition, and the effort is definitely noticed and obviously welcomed. Midway had already impressed us with Deadly Alliance on the Game Boy Advance, offering a game that not only looked great on the handheld, but also played well with an aggressive, combo-based fighting engine. We've already raved about that development, which is why this review focuses on the additional elements that Tournament Edition brings to the handheld. The game's technical ~wow~ factor has died off in the sequel, but the focus on adding features -- both for single as well as multiple players -- keeps the design exciting and fun. And it's definitely worth a purchase...even if you've fronted the dough for the original.", "date": "Aug 28, 2003"}
