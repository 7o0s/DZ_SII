It's not even a matter of years any more; it's more like decades, but the point is we have come a long way from such titles as Defender of Crown. Today's PC games shouldn't really be called games any more. They are more like projects, the success of which revolves around common efforts of talented designers, sometimes even screenwriters, or music composers. Creating an immersive computer world takes a lot more than just delivering a few lines of text and a bunch of weird names that we're supposed to identify with. The word immersive these days (I'm sorry to say) doesn't just rely on our own capacity to imagine. It relies more often on our capacity to be amazed by something, and lead by talented storytellers. So, what is the perfect genre to depict an immersive PC generated world? Some would say action-adventure, but the fact is that any game today that aspires to create stronger bonds with the gamer has to have a RPG label pinned to it. Role-playing games... You take on a role and you play it out, and the form of which you go about playing that role could be anything from classical adventure to action, FPS and real-time strategy. One important thing though --- whichever way developers choose to create the virtual world, the principles mentioned above are expected to apply. Why else would you bother, right?  Well, wrong... If the realization of this simple sounding idea was easy, we'd have games of Homeworld and Starcraft quality all over the place, and every title would be a must have. Take Tzar for example. A little known Bulgarian company is trying to establish themselves on the market with their latest medieval/wizardry real-time strategy/RPG, and as one of my good friends would say -- this game has everything in place, and yet it really has no special features worth remembering. Well, folks that about sums it up. I'm sorry to have to break it to you like this this early in the review, but it's a harsh, competitive world out there. Tzar is a very typical real-time strategy game in terms of pure gameplay/combat, with an effort to add epochal feelings of unique character interaction and interesting plot twists. Somehow and for some reason the game falls short in that department, and I'll try to explain why and how later in this article.  Storyline  Well if you're crazy about epic poems of heroes and villains and you feel like life is just one big fairy tale, I think you'll find Tzar's story to be the ~right stuff~. I think I'm being very subjective here, so take my next comment with a grain of salt. I just cannot fall for that iron-chin type of a hero, without a flaw to his character or a nasty little thought on his mind. And it's not just that the story is black and white; the character dialogues seem so corny and plain that you just get that B-movie impression from reading the in-game ~words of wisdom~. Everything happened so fast in the first few missions. I just wish the designers took their time a bit to create a little thing called suspense --- After hundreds of years of war Keana has finally fell into the hands of the evil wizard, Borgh. The old King Roan died defending the remains of the shattered kingdom, and it seemed that the fate of the land was sealed forever. Still, a glimpse of hope remained as one of Roan's trusted wizards, Ghiron managed to save King's infant son from the clutches of the evil enemy, and take him away to a secluded village. There the boy grew not knowing his real heritage, nor the drastic chain of events that the fates had in store for him. Meeting up with wizard Ghiron for the first time after the death of his father, young Sartor, now a strapping 6 footer will follow his destiny and reunite what was left of his father's honor guard. He will set forth to destroy the evil Borgh, reclaim his kingdom and bring peace joy and happiness once again to the land of Keana. What's wrong with this story? There is nothing wrong with the story itself; it's the way it is carried out that is somewhat naive. The characters are too shallow and the plot is rigid and stereotypical. Let's face it; Tzar is relying heavily on the storyline and characters.   It is the main reason why some would call the game a RPG-strategy hybrid, and the sad truth is that this element is one of game's weaker points. Overall, it is unoriginal without well thought out dramatic effects, and with little in form of added movie-like features to enhance the story's tension and add some atmosphere. Some would say  come on, man, it's just an RTS, don't expect it to be Baldur's Gate, but as I said role playing genre can be achieved through a lot of different genres (technically), and Tzar is definitely striving to add some role-playing. It is therefore much more open to some story-related criticism than say, Total Annihilation.   What about the RTS element?  What about Tzar as a classic real-time strategy game in terms of its appearance and gameplay style? Visually, the game definitely seems to be under the influence of Blizzard's Warcraft series. The graphics are certainly much more elaborate and better looking than in Warcraft II; in fact, they constitute one of the game's best assets. I played the game in 1024x768 with high colors and the units and terrain looked attractive and detailed. Very detailed indeed, with some nice touches like clouds, weather effects, and the changes from day to night... You could say that the graphics are a mix of Warcraft II and TA: Kingdoms, but with the lack of 3D enhanced effects. The way in which the environment and units are created is definitely Blizzard-like though, with trees and buildings looking like the enhanced, and more current version of the Warcraft II style. Even the menu screen reminds me awful lot of the one in the immortal Warcraft II. I personally take the fact that the Bulgarian team took some cues from Blizzard as a positive thing, and I feel that even the fussiest real-time strategy fans will find the visuals satisfying.  This is something you can hardly say about the game's background music. Tzar has some rather annoying MIDI tracks to boost. One other hiccup is that the dialogues are textual, and without any voiceovers. Fortunately, the sounds of units and sword fighting are well done and believable. The game supports 3D audio effects, and it sometimes does add to the impression of an ongoing battle. As for the MIDIs, I tried going through the repetitive music themes, but I got bored eventually and had to turn them off. MIDI music tracks really do take some of the atmosphere away, and it just hurts me when I think how much of an influence a great musical score had in, for example, Homeworld.  Finally, we come to the very core of any good real-time strategy combat, that being the command interface and AI. I mean talk about conservative game options... When you look at Tzar's in-game command options, you just get a sense that time froze and there is absolutely nothing new to be achieved in the units-control, and combat command aspects of real-time strategy battles. You have your xx/100 hit points, stand ground, attack, patrol, guard... and did I miss something? One essential thing that is missing from the gameplay is unit formations. It is so frustrating and challenging when your soldiers are behaving like a bunch of happy campers in the battlefield. When you select a group of units and order them to move in a certain direction they will assume the formation according to the way they were scattered before you issued the order. Given some brilliant path finding that I will mention a bit later, the player ends up chasing the units all across the map trying to make them assume some rational defensive or offensive position. And of course, there is the ever-present kamikaze, suicide-units, where a few of your archers are rushing on a horde of knights just so they could get a better shot. Along with the pains of organizing troops, you have to constantly watch Sartor's butt (as well as a few other crucial heroes), as he really isn't the smartest of bravehearts, often trying to use the kamikaze-rush move himself. Add to this some generally inadequate path finding, most evident when you try to move a larger number of troops, and you realize that what you have are the same old real-time strategy problems evident from the days of Westwood's first RTS games.   On the positive note, the game features some massive scale battles, with a lot of blood and gore contributing to the more grandiose and interesting sense of epic battles. Also, there are three nations, Arabs, Asians and Europeans each with its distinct cultures, units and architecture, and there is a fun, cooperative type of command featured in the game's final mission. Wizards are able to materialize dragons and Arab sorcerers can summon Genies. Genies are fun, as long as we don't get to use that skinny little kid Aladdin to defeat the evil Borgh.   Conclusion   It's not that Tzar isn't any good. It has some nicely done features, and overall, some elements of the game make it fun to play. I guess two of Tzar's main problems are lack of originality in many aspects, and a poor factor of immersion. The other two technical problems are poorly done AI and the lack of unit formations. Like my friend said, this game has everything in place with nothing spectacular.   -- Uros Jojic", "date": "Apr 14, 2000"}
