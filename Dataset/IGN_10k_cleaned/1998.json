You see, if Motor Mayhem were released a few months earlier it could've been a great title to keep you busy until the release of Twisted Metal and if it were released later this year, it could've had value as a car combat game to pick up for those that have tired of Sony's blockbuster.   As it stands, Motor Mayhem will be completely covered in the shadow of Incog Inc.'s car combat game and will likely get overlooked and completely ignored by just about everyone. With that said, Infogrames' futuristic car combat title isn't one that should be disregarded. While it is clearly not in the same league as Twisted Metal: Black by any means, it does have its merits and could be a welcome alternative to those who can't stomach the gruesome theme and atmosphere of Twisted Metal. Because, after all, it's not rate M.  Gameplay With Motor Mayhem, the developers have opted for a no-holds barred, bare-boned WWF-styled approach to the game. The single player modes consists of a basic Quick Start mode which lets you jump into a deathmatch against one to six computer-controlled opponents with the ability to adjust the things like difficulty level, kill limit and weapons, plus a very generic Career mode.   The Career mode is essentially the meat and bones of the game, but there's not really that much to it. You basically select one of the eight main characters, then take them through three different tournaments -- Eliminator, Deathmatch and Endurance. The tournaments consist of different play styles -- last man standing, play for a certain amount of kills, and one-on-one against several opponents -- and the story and character development takes place through some newspaper headlines between each main event. Sadly, this just doesn't work and the characters are completely uninteresting and just don't have any sort of appeal to them at all.   Because of this and the fact that the story just isn't that intriguing (you're participating in the Vehicle Combat League, big wow), just makes the single player experience not too enticing. What's worse, the gameplay just isn't there, either. The control can be a bit awkward at times, as you'll find yourself stuck in walls on occasion (don't fret, because the computer gets stuck too), there should've been more controller configuration options, and the computer artificial intelligence can be a little strange every now and then.   Every once in a while, you'll see weird things happening like a computer car continuously backing up and then ramming a wall and then doing this over and over again until you knock him off course or kill him. Likewise, on the game's normal difficulty setting, it's easy to just slowly follow a computer car and just whale on him unto he's dead. The game does get tougher when you beef up the difficulty and the computer AI improves, but you'll still encounter some awkward stuff whether you have the game set on Normal, Hard or even Very Hard.   While it's possible to look past the AI and control issues, we sadly can't say the same thing about the game's framerate. There's a ton of slowdown in the game and things will get so choppy that it seriously detracts from the game's level of fun.   And before you start thinking that maybe the multiplayer aspect of the game will save it, the game unfortunately lacks support for more than two players. The game's multiplayer mode is limited to two human controlled cars, as there's no support for the multi-tap, and while it's better than nothing, it's just not acceptable. It's pretty obvious that with this engine that four-player split screen probably would've extremely choppy and unplayable, but it would've been worth lowering the texture detail and decreasing the amount of background objects to allow for a good framerate in both full-screen and split-screen play modes.   The sad part of all this is that it does look like the developers put a lot of effort into this game as it doesn't feel at all rushed and parts of the game show a lot of promise. The weapons and special combos kick a massive amount of supermodel ass and the game's level of presentation is simply something you don't normally see in a videogame. With a solid framerate and some tightening up of the control and AI, this could've been something worth picking up.   Graphics Much like the gameplay, the graphics in Motor Mayhem offer a mixed bag of both good and bad characteristics. On the good side, the character and vehicle animation is pretty impressive, the vehicles appear to have high polygon counts and the lighting and special effects of the weapon fire and explosions are some of the best you'll see outside of a doctored Army Men screenshot.   The 3D levels are also creatively designed and feature an insane amount of destructible and damageable parts and structures. Bridges can be caused to collapse, walls can be knocked down and machine gun fire will leave marks on the walls.   The problem with all of this is that it seems as if the destructible background elements, large 3D levels and pretty lighting has come at the cost of a solid framerate. While the game does move pretty fast most of the time, the framerate will often take a substantial dip when there's a lot of stuff going on onscreen at once, especially when there are some background objects being destroyed. If not for this slowdown problem, Motor Mayhem would be one of the more impressive games on PlayStation 2 as far as visuals are concerned.   Sound Outside of the songs from Methods of Mayhem and Crystal Method, the soundtrack for Motor Mayhem is completely forgettable. The background music is comprised of some techno-ish sounding beats, but there's nothing really here that'll pump you up or really get you excited about playing the game.   We could've really used a good soundtrack here because things even get worse in the audio department when you factor in the sound effects. While the weapon effects and lighting are extremely impressive, they lose a lot of their impact because the sound effects for the weapon fire and explosions lack punch and don't have any power behind them.  Even if you completely wipe clean your memory of Twisted Metal: Black and just look at Motor Mayhem all by itself, you will still see a fairly shallow game that lacks any sort of discernable charm. The game's characters are lifeless and are completely devoid of personality, which makes it hard for anyone to grow any kind of attachment to any of them, thusly making the single player experience uninteresting and somewhat dull. The game's value does increase substantially when you factor in the multiplayer aspect of it, but even in this area, you'll encounter a lot of problems that can't be completely dismissed like some slowdown issues and other graphical glitches. Motor Mayhem is not a bad game by any means; it's just not that great, either. And with the PlayStation 2's software line-up getting stronger and stronger every week, it's going to be a lot easier to pass up on anything less than wonderful.", "date": "Jun 26, 2001"}
