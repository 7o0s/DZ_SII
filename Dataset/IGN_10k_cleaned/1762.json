There's just something about the game that's zen-like in its experience. Put a good table in your house, and you've got a leisure killer for the rest of your life. It may be another century before people forget their highest scores earned on pinball machines in the 1980s.Unfortunately, those great machines have gone away, and the only place to get your pinball fix is in video pinball. Somehow, it's never the same, and while Left Field's newest video table for Sierra Attractions has a good feel, it's not nearly as fun or as addictive as it could be.FeaturesFull-scale pinball table with several mini-challenge pinball gamesRealistic pinball features -- tilt the table, or ring up the multiballRumble Cartridge to feel every bumperRunning on the same engine as Disney's Little Mermaid Pinball, 3D Ultra Pinball  tries to duplicate that game's average level of success. The ball physics are exactly the same -- some good motion algorithms, but trap the ball with the flipper and the steel will jump and jitter like it's on a hot plate. I wasn't a great big fan of Little Mermaid's physics, and this game amplifies those errors by trying to be more realistic and challenging -- thicker gaps and tougher runways are more challenging than the kiddie Little Mermaid, but the control in the flippers isn't there. Particularly in trying to aim for chutes or transferring the ball from one side to another by springing the ball halfway down on the flipper, where the ball should only get half the force and pop with very little spin (as opposed to waiting for when the ball gets all the way on the tip of the flipper, where you can shoot it with the highest speed), the game just doesn't simulate physics well. The ball leaps off the flipper just as forcefully at the tip as on a tap halfway down the flipper, making aiming a matter of luck.Graphically, 3D Ultra Pinball is an absolute misnomer -- the visuals are flat as a pinball table's glass. Even ramps and bumpers are simple dots, circles, and 2D shapes instead of rounded bumpers. That's problems for depth perception, making it tough to figure out where the ball needs to go. The PC version was way too cluttered, but this game is downright empty, with boring ramps and few features. And in a game of pinball, where the lights and colors are a huge part of the attraction,  the muted, colorless graphic pallet wasn't  the right choice for everything in the game. The background is dull grey, the ramps are blah brown, and the bumpers are flat blue. When the graphics try to express details, it's either simplistic shapes with funky fonts scrawled on top (what the heck are you trying to spell at the bottom?!?) or pixilated figures (the top of the table is a garble).It's a shame Left Field didn't instead go with the features of Video Pinball instead of making this mess of a single pinball table, because their mini-tables are a lot more fun. Kind of like the challenges in Kirby's Pinball or Pokmon Pinball, players must compete challenges on a table to make things happen. These mini-stages in 3D Ultra Pinball aren't always as clever as Nintendo's efforts, but they can be fun. The Log Chute is a particularly good challenge of strategy and aim. If only it weren't as hard to reach the bonus stages -- Little Mermaid was lots easier.Credit is due to the stylish Amiga-level of music, and the mini-stages are enjoyable, but I didn't like this game anywhere near as much as Little Mermaid Pinball. The flat graphics are much more lifeless here, and except for those mini-games, there's really only one pinball table to play here. One? The mini-games are fun, and there's an extra bonus hidden deep if you're a good player, but otherwise there's not a lot of variety going down on this table. And if you already have Little Mermaid (or the significantly better Pokmon / Kirby Pinball), there's even less here for pinball fans. If the physics were perfect, there'd reason to go back. But as soon as the pinball lands on top of a pencil-thin gate and gets permanently stuck, like it's being held in place magnetically or that there's gum on top of the gate (and this happens a few times if you're not quick with the tilting), you'll probably do as I did and put the game down to make a trip for the local arcade. Make that trip while you still have time, because Video Pinball's not cutting it yet.", "date": "Feb 3, 2001"}
