{"name": "Falcon 4.0", "name_review": "Falcon 4.0", "ref": "https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/04/16/falcon-40-2", "text": "Falcon 4.0 has been through several patches since its release in late December, and the list of bugs they address is very long. The game is so incredibly complex that a lot of these problems weren't readily apparent to gamers playing the released version of Falcon 4.0 -- but the read-me files included with each new patch tell the tale, listing bug after bug that the patch fixes.  So...if Falcon 4.0 was such a troubled product before all of these patches (and the fact is, it'll probably need one or two more before all the problems are worked out), why doesn't it score as badly as a notoriously unfinished game like eXtreme PaintBrawl? The reason is simple: despite the multiple patches, Falcon 4.0 still offers hardcore air combat fans a lot to love.  Falcon 4.0 features a very convincing flight model and extremely deep and detailed avionics, with four air-to-air radar modes and three air-to-ground radar modes (all with various submodes tailored to specific weapons and situations). Other targeting systems include forward-looking infrared for Maverick missiles, a laser guidance pod for smart bombs, and the anti-radar system used to lock HARM missiles onto enemy air defenses. Multiple automatic pilot modes can be linked to mission waypoints or ground-based navigation beacons (in fact, approaching home plate and landing with Falcon 4.0's instruments is as detailed a task as it is in a civilian sim like Microsoft's Flight Simulator). If you go in for the kind of sim that gives you lots of displays to read, instruments to watch, and switches to flip, Falcon 4.0 will make you happier than you've been since you first fired up Jane's F-15.  And that's only what's going on inside the cockpit. Outside, you're treated to the most impressive graphics you'll find in a sim (as long as you've got the hardware to run it). External views let you check out the ground war that's constantly unfolding in the game's real-time dynamic campaign -- or just watch a laser-guided 2,000-pound bomb smack into an enemy hangar. The explosions look fantastic, by the way, and splash damage is tracked, so a bomb that hits a moored patrol boat may also take out the dock, the factory next to the dock, the anti-aircraft guns protecting the factory, and maybe even one or two of the armored vehicles protecting those guns.  It takes some time and patience to master all the systems and weapons you'll need to use to carry out a successful sortie, but what could've been a very steep learning curve is smoothed out quite a bit by 31 detailed tutorial missions. A good portion of the game's huge manual is devoted to these tutorials, which cover each task, targeting system, and weapon in great detail. Take the time to become proficient in all of the training missions, and you'll be ready for just about anything the ~real~ missions can throw at you.  And those missions really do feel real. That's where Falcon 4.0 clearly separates itself from most other games that, like it, should've had at least one more pass through Quality Assurance before they were released: it has its problems, but when it's firing on all cylinders, this sim is utterly believable, absorbing, and entertaining. The first time you put a load of high explosives on the target in a deep strike mission while flak, tracer rounds, and missiles fill the sky around you -- then make it home in one piece -- you'll know this sim is something special.   It doesn't come without a price, though. In addition to the need to download the latest patch and watch for more updates on the game's web site (www.falcon4.com), you'll have to have a pretty stout system to run it properly. Falcon 4.0 will run acceptably on a midrange Pentium II, but forget the Pentium 166 that MicroProse lists as the minimum. And you'll need a 450MHz machine with 128MB RAM and a fast 3D accelerator (like a Voodoo2- or TNT-based board) to get truly smooth performance with all the graphics options cranked up.   Still, if you're a serious air combat fan looking for a sim that's big, beautiful, challenging, and truly convincing, Falcon 4.0 is tough to beat.  -- Luke Shannon", "date": "Apr 16, 1999"}
