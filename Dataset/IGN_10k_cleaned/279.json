NHL 2000, like its predecessors, attempts to improve upon last year's flaws, while maintaining the qualities of such a successful franchise. Nevertheless, one question still remains- can EA capture the essence of their classic 16-bit NHL series and finally translate it into a game for the PSX? It's hard to tell, but I must say they've gotten darn close this year.   This officially licensed game has all the goods for die-hard hockey fans, including the new expansion Atlanta Thrashers franchise. You can still play exhibition games, start a season, create your own tournament or test your skills in a shootout. Also, for the first time in this series, the regular season can extend into a full career, which lets you build, manage and play a team over a 10-year span. Young players not only improve over time, but they age too.  Gameplay Speed was the biggest problem with NHL 99. Developers cited an increase in resolution as the culprit for slowing down the game. This time around, the gameplay is 10 frames-per-second faster than before, and the second you start playing, you'll see the difference. Movement is very smooth. Guys like Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne have a much easier time gliding from blue line to blue line, while avoiding their slower counterparts. Also, for the first time in this series, player attributes actually mean something. Good skaters like Pavel Bure move better than others, and big hitters have an easier time bringing down their enemies. So heed my warning- you cannot make your favorite goon score 5 goals in one period. It's just not part of his make-up... but he can still beat the crap out of your opponent's top scorer.   The most important enhancement in NHL 2K, by far, is player control. Players respond to your every whim... Well, almost, because at times they're going so fast, they crash into the boards without being touched by the opposition. Then again, if that's the only complaint, this game is worth some serious playing time.   Turning, stopping and starting have been big issues in the past. Programmers and developers are always looking for that edge to bring realism into an artificially rendered world, and EA Sports is getting closer to the promised land. The improvement from last year is astounding. It probably goes back to the increase in frames per second, but player movement is pseudo-realistic. Guys decelerate into stops much quicker and accelerate out of them at an equal rate. Turning at sharper angles is no longer an issue. Even the goalies make impressive saves more frequently, via a variety of splits and dives. The best this gamer has seen is a full-length dive with one leg up in the air to deflect a calculated high-shot. Of course, the goalie was two-time league MVP Dominik Hasek. No surprise there. All in all, the goaltenders make you work for your points, unless you're playing on the beginner level.   Speaking of beginners, here's a useful suggestion. When you're on a breakaway, hit the triangle button as you near the goalie. That's the new ~deke~ move, which leaves the opposing netminder clueless, and if done correctly, sets up an easy goal... Hey, you mean it's just like real hockey? Yes, and if you press the same button without the puck, you'll deliver the ~dedicated big hit,~ which puts your man and the puck-handler out of commission for a few secs. But wait, there's more. After scoring a goal or winning a brawl, press the triangle button again to do a wide variety of taunts. One button- simple, yet so effective.  Graphics With the framerate being increased dramatically from last year, one would expect the graphics to suffer just a bit. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to see the best graphics in a hockey game to date. Thanks to improved technology, players don't have that typical ~blocky~ look. Their bodies are rounded out, and if you look really close, their faces resemble actual players. I mean, there are times when you can recognize a player without even looking at his number, which is pretty cool. They cast realistic shadows on the ice as well, instead of those dark blobs that gamers are so accustomed to.      If you want more authenticity, then take a quick look at the different uniforms available in this game. Most teams are given 3 jerseys: home, away and inaugural, which in some cases, dates back to the beginning of the league. They are true to life, and as an avid sports historian, I'll tell ya that the developers did a fine job getting their hands on the old jerseys.   The only movie sequence in the game to my knowledge is in the introduction, and every year, the compiled footage gets better. This time, clips include your obligatory hard-hits, game-winning goals and fantastic glove saves, edited rhythmically to the tune of Garbage's ~Push It.~ Be sure to check it out at least once, cause it truly kicks ass.  Sound  Another great aspect of NHL 2K is the sound quality. Whether it's the opening intro, the national anthem at the beginning of each match or sound effects during the game, there's rarely a quiet moment during play. CD-quality sound keeps the blood flowing in your fingers and the adrenaline rushing up and down your nervous system. In addition to Garbage, the game features music by Uberzone, Gearwhore and Rincerose. Combine that with anthems from across the globe, including Japan and O Canada!, and you have a good example of art imitating life. Just kidding, but you get the point.   In-game commentary has also improved from last year, with the addition of color-man Bill Clement and broadcaster Jim Hughson, but it could still use some improvement. Commentators run out of things to say too quickly. I was impressed though when Hughson announced the first name of my created player. At first, I thought it was a glitch, but after listening attentively, there was no mistake in his call. Now, don't go creating a player named ~Deveraux St. Pierre,~ hoping to hear a brilliant call on your shot from the point. I'm sure using the name ~Andy~ helped my cause.If you couldn't tell, I'm a sucker for cool intros, and EA Sports' NHL 2000 doesn't disappoint. The gameplay is flat-out better than any 32-bit hockey game, and I've played my fair share of em. Still, my main concern is how well it feels compared to NHL 94 for the Genesis. Like I said before, this one comes pretty close. The graphics are absolutely insane and player control is the best yet for any PSX game, but there's always room for improvement. That's why we get a brand new game every year. I really enjoy the tournament mode, where you can play against NHL teams or countries. It's fun to pick Canada, the U.S. or the Czech Republic- a must if you like Jaromir Jagr or Mr. Hasek- and destroy countries that barely have any pro talent. It's also cool to see the various rink layouts and assorted anthems as you're vying for the coveted gold. Why should you buy NHL 2000? Because it's the best PSX hockey game on the market. Period. Don't just take my word for it. Go ahead and give it a shot. Be careful, though...It's addictive.", "date": "Oct 2, 1999"}
